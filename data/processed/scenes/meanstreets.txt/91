<A>__{living room & kitchenette party night most of the characters that were at the club the other night are present at the party. many of them are dressed in semi masquerade outfits. some are wearing soldiers' uniforms. one wears a sheet made up to be a roman toga. the girls are in costumes also. all of the costumes are makeshift. michael is made up as dracula, sporting a large cape, semi tuxedo type suit, and a drop of blood on the corner of his mouth. his hair is slicked back to give him a "bela lugosi" look. he is showing a picture of a girl to one of the boys, proudly proclaiming that she is his latest conquest. tony comes out of the bathroom and passes by. he takes the photo from michael. group attention focuses on tony now. he stares at the picture, holds it away from him, then closer to his face, then sideways and finally upside down.}

<D>__{oh sure! i know her michael...in fact, i saw her a few days ago under a bridge in jersey, making out with a nigger.}
<A>__{michael grimaces in shock. he spits.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you sure?...a nigger...uh!...and i kissed her.}
<A>__{he wipes his lips with his cape. the guest of honor, the young soldier is very drunk. he is attempting to open his going away presents, one of which turns out to be a carefully folded american flag. he attempts to open it with one great flourish. he fails however, knocking over the glasses on the table. the group applauds. suddenly, the doorbell rings and everyone looks up. the door opens and charlie appears, arms outstretched, dressed as the ressurected christ with white robes, fake beard and hair, and artificial wounds. his arms stretch out wider. the initial shock wears off and tony greets him.}
<C>__{tony}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{hallelujah!!}
<A>__{charlie enters in mock holiness.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i have come to create order... scotch and water please.}
<A>__{they all laugh. the rock music blares as charlie walks to and fro blessing all in the room. tony is delighted with the scene. charlie sits at the kitchen table, tony opposite him, and the others gather around. the party is getting noisier. tony gives charlie a glass of ice cubes. charlie plays the part of a priest, during the mass when the chalice is filled with wine and water, tony pours the scotch over his fingers first. charlie lifts his hands to touch the bottle as a priest would. he signifies that there is enough in the glass. tony then repeats the same ritual with a bottle of soda water.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{may god be with you.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{'and with your spirit.'}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(gesturing with his drink)}
<D>__{salute!!!}
<A>__{everyone drinks after repeating the toast. the crowd around them begins to break up as charlie and tony begin to have fun with each other. tony pulls down his mask, revealing a skeleton death face which covers his own face except for his mouth. it completes the dough boy uniform quite well.}
<C>__{tony}
<P>__{(taking on the guise of an interviewer)}
<D>__{'art thou the king of the jews'?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{'dost thou say this of thyself, or have others told thee of me?'}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{'am i a jew? thy own people and the chief priests have delivered thee to me. what hast thou done?'}
<A>__{michael and a few of the others gather around again as they continue.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{'my kingdom is not of this world. if my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that i might not be delivered to the jews. but, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{'thou art then a king?'}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{'thou sayest it; i am a king. this is why i was born and why i have come into this world, to bear witness to the truth. everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.'}
<A>__{tony leans over towards charlie.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{'what is the truth?'}
<A>__{the others around them give mock applause. tony smiles and nods his head to them. charlie laughs. they drink. someone hits charlie on the back of the head. charlie startled, looks up.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{prophesy to us, oh christ! who is it that struck thee?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i don't know, but god help him if he does it again!}
<A>__{they all laugh.}
