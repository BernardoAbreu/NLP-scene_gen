<L>__{exterior abandoned farmhouse roof sunset}
<A>__{doug and pamela sit on the ridge of the farmhouse roof (they climbed out of a dormer window from the attic).}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{i think my dad was like jacey is. some guys are just dare devils. i bet jacey once that he couldn't do a back flip off the garage roof into a big pile of leaves. and he did it.}
<C>__{pamela}
<P>__{(slight beat)}
<D>__{one time eleanor and i snuck out and walked around the yard naked.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{you did?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{yeah. it was sort of a dare, too. she dared me, i dared her, so we both did it.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{was this day or night?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{night.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{was there a full moon?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{i don't remember.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{you walked around the yard or did you like run from tree to tree?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{we just walked around the yard.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{front yard or back yard?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{back yard.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{does it matter?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{yeah. back yard nudity is hypocritical. it's insincere. people should do and say exactly what they feel or think and not try to hide things.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{their conversation is stifled by this new standard of absolute honesty. the sunset provides a convenient excuse for their silence. but then pam realizes he is staring at her.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{you look pretty.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{yup.}
<A>__{pamela takes his hand, gently unfolds it, and with her index finger she writes on his palm, "i love you." telling him took all the nerve she could muster, she hasn't the stamina for a disappointing response she places her fingers on his lips to silence him. doug leans over and kisses her, sweetly and tenderly, and for a long time. they will always remember this kiss.}
