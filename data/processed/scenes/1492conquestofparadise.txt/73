<L>__{exterior jungle day}
<A>__{immediately they are met by an incredible wall of sound! the jungle is filled with noise. the impossibly loud cries of exotic birds, the chattering of monkeys. the spaniards are overwhelmed. they move forward. rays of sunlight pierce through the high canopy of leaves, like the roof of a magnificent cathedral. the sounds and smells intoxicate their senses. they are filled with wonder. then pinzon stops. he has seen something. another stops, then a third, staring ahead of them...}

<A>__{several of them raise their weapons to their shoulders, pointing them into the jungle. from columbus' pov we slowly scan the face of the thick jungle ahead. for a moment we don't see anything and then, with a shock, we see the first indian. naked, painted like an idol, carrying a hunting lance. as if they had materialized from nowhere: the rest of the hunting party, with their bows and spears. silent. watchful. they stare back at us. the spaniards nervously finger their weapons. columbus slowly lifts his hand into the air: a clear signal not to fire. then, removing his sword, he drops it on the ground, and starts to walk forward, fixing his gaze upon the first indian he saw.}

<A>__{columbus ignores him, even though some of the indians have raised their weapons. he stops in the no man's land between them. the indians don't move but something excites them. the ship's boy, wearing columbus' embroidered jacket and the drum, has followed columbus and now stands close to him. he is the cause of their interest. columbus puts his arm around the boy, and this gesture of affection seems to put the indians at their ease. they start talking and pointing. they come forward slowly, start to tentatively touch the boy's jacket. then, now laughing, they touch columbus, pulling at his beard. columbus laughs too. sensing their innocence, the rest of the men lower their weapons. some of them laugh. an apparition: a beautiful young indian girl, totally naked, walks out of the jungle. she is pregnant and holds a child. we begin to hear indian music, played on a flute.}
