<L>__{int ambrose's (day)}
<A>__{they've reached the head of the stairs. ambrose opens a door. it's a large bedroom opening onto a veranda with a view of the tent annex and the beach, and a very large bed.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{your room.}
<C>__{ambrose}
<P>__{(yes)}
<D>__{mmmm.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{and my room?}
<A>__{a long moment. ambrose walks to a mirrored wall. the mirrors are sliding doors. with a sweeping gesture, he slides one of the mirrors back and reveals a wardrobe of beautiful designer clothes.}
<C>__{ambrose}
<D>__{thought you could use a little something to wear.}
<A>__{nyah stares at the spectacular wardrobe. ambrose pulls out a slinky armani and drapes it on the bed.}
<C>__{ambrose }
<D>__{try it on..}
<A>__{nyah hesitates.}
<C>__{ambrose }
<D>__{go ahead. i'm dying to see if i remembered your size..}
<A>__{nyah picks it up.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{no changing room?}
<A>__{ambrose sits on a chair by the window and waits. her blouse, belt, skirt, fall on the bed. as her slender arm reaches down to pick up the armani:}
<B>__{ambrose}
<A>__{grips her wrist, the flimsy armani dangling in the air. close nyah meeting ambrose's look.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{you're not interested in seeing how it looks.}
<C>__{ambrose}
<D>__{oh, i am. later..}
<A>__{the armani falls in a fragile heap on the floor. close ethan (dusk) standing off to one side, listening to nekhorvich's voice.}
<C>__{nekhorvich}
<D>__{..therefore in a search for our hero, bellerophon, we created a monster, chimera.}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{why's nekhorvich going on about an old greek myth?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{nekhorvich specialized in recombining dna molecules. in the myth, bellerophon killed chimera, a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world. i think nekhorvich has created a monster virus in chimera and apparently the means to kill it in bellerophon.}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{that simple, huh?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{why not?}
<A>__{close nyah (interior ambrose bedroom dusk) lying back on a pillow, looking and off into space to right off camera. she hears ambrose's voice, with ethan's voice}
<D>__{ambrose's voice ethan's voice damn, you're beautiful..}
<A>__{nyah reacts as if she'd been rapped on the nose, her eyes moist. she turns abruptly to camera.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{did you say something?}
<B>__{ambrose}
<A>__{leaning on an elbow, looking down.}
<C>__{ambrose}
<D>__{i said you're beautiful, nyah.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{only because..it's spring..chalk it up}
<P>__{(looking him dead in the eye)}
<D>__{ to spring fever.}
<A>__{ambrose, amused, lights a cigarette and inhaling:}
<C>__{ambrose}
<D>__{won't do, love. it's not spring. it's nearly autumn..you're in oz. everything's upside down and backwards here.}
<C>__{nyah}
<P>__{(more direct)}
<D>__{maybe that's it, then. everything's upside down and backwards...}
<A>__{close ethan (sheep farm safehouse dusk)}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{luther..get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on bruny island last month, including photos of the victims.}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{right. i guess there aren't many flu epidemics in the middle of summer.}
<A>__{luther resumes working on his computer and sees ethan is locked on ambrose's compound on his computer screen, thinking of nyah.}
<C>__{luther }
<D>__{she did it, ethan. nyah's in the compound.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{yeah? i've just rolled up a snowball and tosses it into hell.}
<A>__{ethan stands.}
<B>__{outside the sheep farm safehouse}
<A>__{a brooding ethan exits the sheep farm safehouse under a setting sun.}
<C>__{ethan's voice}
<D>__{now we'll see what chance it has.}
<A>__{ethan stops, looking out over the broken plain. his voice is heard overlapping into the next scene.}
<C>__{ethan's voice }
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{damn, you're beautiful.}
<A>__{close nyah (night) lying in bed, obviously hearing ethan's voice again, and feeling very much alone. she stares out into the night, a gaze that in its bemused intensity is an exact match to ethan's.}
