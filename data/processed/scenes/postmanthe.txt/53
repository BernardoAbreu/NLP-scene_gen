<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior abandoned hotel room 7 day}
<A>__{the postman wakes, reaches for the warm body that was there last night. but abby is gone. all that's left behind is her red ribbon. wistful, he picks it up.}
<L>__{exterior abandoned hotel day}
<A>__{the postman exits. in uniform, his bag slung over his shoulder. he starts then stops short. only now do we see most of the townspeople have silently assembled here. they've been waiting for him, starving for him. ford steps up, hands him another fresh packet of letters. the postman sees that ford hangs on to four or five.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{what about those?}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{these are going to blue jay. about twenty miles east. i thought i could take them.}
<A>__{the postman scans the crowd. looking for abby maybe?}
<C>__{the postman}
<P>__{(absently)}
<D>__{okay. they're yours.}
<A>__{briscoe rides up, regards the postman sternly.}
<C>__{briscoe}
<D>__{i'm your escort out of town.}
<A>__{some of the town's citizens lead up a saddled mare.}
<D>__{citizen #1 we took a vote, mr. postman. we want you to have this horse. citizen #2 now don't say no. a man on horseback can cover ten times the territory of a man on foot.}
<C>__{the postman}
<P>__{(smiles at briscoe)}
<D>__{i will take it.}
<A>__{he ties his mailbag to the saddle, swings himself up.}
<D>__{citizen #3 there's a bedroll, some oats and a week's rations.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{thank you. citizen #1 where do you figure you'll go from here?}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{go?... oh yeah... i will head west, then work my way back here in a sort of figure eight.}
<A>__{"8." everyone's quiet a moment. they shift uncomfortably. the postman looks out at the crowd. they crave hope. he should probably just keep his mouth shut.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{times seem hard right now. but you have to believe it's getting better. birds are migrating again. the rains are back.}
<A>__{the people consider him and then each other. by god, they do feel hopeful. suddenly, ellen, her little boy by her side, begins to sing. it's weak at first, but one by one the others join in. soon the whole town is singing:}
<D>__{ellen & town 'oh beautiful for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain. for purple mountain's majesty, above the fruited plain. america...'}
<A>__{the postman looks around. they sing their hearts out. the guilt is overwhelming. he digs his heels into the horse's flanks and rides out of town.}
