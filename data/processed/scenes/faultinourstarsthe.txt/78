<A>__{hazel and gus ride the crowded tram through the city. elm trees line the canals, their pale petals blowing into the wind like a spring snowstorm. an old couple stands to give up their seats this happens all the time. hazel again tries to protest and again it falls on deaf ears. she and gus sit. they look out the window onto the city. excited. the night just beginning.}
