<A>__{at the back of the traffic jam, cars screech to stops. the whole bridge is full of bumper to bumper traffic. we push toward one car: three doors pop open, and out come... reed, johnny, sue. they look through smoke and mayhem to see...their first full look at ben. reed stands gutpunched.}

<A>__{ben puts the seat down, with the driver on it. he lunges behind a truck. the cops try to follow, but flames push them back. ben lurches away, head down, self conscious. he tries to hide from onlookers around him and pedestrians on walkways overhead. he wants to escape, but hears screaming motorists. he grits his teeth, and moves to help them.}
