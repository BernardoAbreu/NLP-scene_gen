<L>__{exterior suburban street afternoon}
<A>__{so darkened by weather that it is almost night, raining torrents and big sheets. rob emerges from the front door of laura's parents' house and begins walking down the street, hands thrust into his pockets. the rain almost immediately soaks him.}
<L>__{exterior another street}
<A>__{in the distance, rob runs toward us. as he gets to us we move with him down the street. he is drenched. we hear the rain, and his ragged breath. headlights appear behind him and backlight him, getting brighter as the sound of an engine gets louder. rob takes a look over his shoulder, looks desperately left and right, and vaults himself over a small brick wall and into a flower bed, landing on his back in the black wet earth. the big drops of rain splash mud on his face, and he burrows deeper into the dirt and flowers with his back, panting and staring up at the sky. off camera the car engine catches up, and a door opens and shuts. he sighs and shuts his eyes... he opens his eyes again, to see laura's face, wet as well, staring down at him. it is difficult to distinguish rain from tears.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{uh... no.}
<A>__{but rob keeps lying there. laura pulls herself to a sitting position on the wall just above him.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{you're soaking.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{mmnn.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{you're also an idiot.}
<A>__{rob pulls his muddy self to his feet and sits on the wall next to her.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i can see why you say that. look, i'm sorry. i really am. the last thing i wanted was... that's why i left, because... i lost it, and i didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason i fucked everything up was because i was scared. i just wanted you to know, that's all.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{thank you. i appreciate it. i can't reciprocate.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i didn't mess things up because i was scared. i slept with ray because i was sick of you. and i needed something to snap me out of it.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{sure, i understand. look, i don't want to take up any more of your time. you get back, and i will wait here for a bus.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i don't want to go back.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{what do you want to do?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{c'mon.}
<A>__{they swing their legs over the wall and walk to laura's vw.}
