<A>__{bud is seated at a corner table with the bluestar union reps: duncan wilmore, alpa leader and toni carpenter, afa rep; also jointed by machinists, dominick amato and charley dent, sitting in for his father's union.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{...the stock's at 19 1 4 and it's going up. gekko figures by breaking up bluestar, it's worth at least $30 a share. that means he'll buy up to 23 or 24 and still think he's making money.}
<C>__{wilmore}
<D>__{how do you know that the stock is going to go up?}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(pointedly)}
<D>__{you really don't want to know any more than that, mr. wilmore. let's just say i have some friends.}
<C>__{wilmore}
<P>__{(getting his drift)}
<D>__{okay. what happens then?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{when the stock hits 23, you guys go to gekko and lower the boom. once he learns he has no union concession, he's going to head for the hills. he'll sell everything he's got.}
<C>__{carpenter}
<D>__{yeah. but who's going to buy then and what's to prevent another shark from coming along and devouring us?}
