<L>__{interior father benedetto's house magic hour}
<A>__{the sun is sinking behind the high mountains that overlook the hilltop town. jack is wearing an immaculate white linen shirt. he's sitting in a small walled garden snuggled at the rear of a crumbling fifteenth century edifice, overlooked yet secluded and trapping the last rays of the sun. father benedetto pours two large glasses of brandy from a globulous green bottle of armagnac and sniffs his drink like a honey bee hovering over a bloom.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{que siamo! the quality of the brandy is good, the liquor is smooth and the glass warmed by the sun.}
<A>__{he pronounces warmed "war med". his english is sophisticated but quaint, like an out of date book. jack sniffs his drink before he sips it. not like a connoisseur: like a white house taster checking the safety of a presidential beverage.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<P>__{(in english)}
<D>__{the only good thing to come from the francesi, everything else...}
<A>__{father benedetto grimaces.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{the french are... pezzi di merda. this is not an american discovery. italians have known this for centuries. [in italian] when rome called france the province of gaul, they were just the same. arrogant sensualists. their cuisine is fussy and their wine effeminate. only their brandy is worthy of any attention.}
<A>__{father benedetto looks at jack.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<P>__{(in english)}
<D>__{forgive me. i speak too fast. you study our history?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{father benedetto looks horrified.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{you come to italy to make a guide book and you don't care about history?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i take pictures, father.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{father benedetto}
<D>__{of course. you are american. you think you can escape history. you live for the present.}
<A>__{a beat. jack likes this man. his shrewdness is disconcerting but humane. jack sips his brandy.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i try to, father.}
