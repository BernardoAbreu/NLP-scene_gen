<L>__{interior champion aircraft benny giacomo's office}
<A>__{a battered wooden desk drawer groans open and light brown skinned hands with dirty fingernails twist the cap off a pint of rye whiskey and pour liquor into a coffee cup.}
<C>__{o.s. voice}
<D>__{you know, when you fire somebody you have to stick to your guns.}
<A>__{they screw the cap back on and lay the bottle in the drawer.}
<C>__{o.s. voice}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{the men might get to thinkin' that i'm weak if i take you back.}
<A>__{the cup rises to the face of benny giacomo, late forties, with salt and pepper hair that was once jet black. skin darker than a louisiana creole. he takes a sip and bares his teeth in a grimace from the whiskey. as he talks we gradually see more of him feet kicked up on the desk, fully in charge. a betty grable like pin up girl is giving us background in more ways than one in a swimsuit and high heels on a calendar tacked to the wall: may, 1948.}
<C>__{benny}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{and i didn't tell dupree that i'd give you your job back... all i said was that i'd be glad to talk to you if you said the right thing... do you have something to say?}
<A>__{a stream of cigarette smoke snakes through as the back of a man's head and shoulder nudges in and shifts nervously.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{mr. giacomo, when one of the white guys has come off a double shift and says he's too tired to work overtime, you don't fire him.}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{fella, what'd i tell ya? if you're not willing to give a little extra, champion can't use you.}
<A>__{easy rawlins, thirty, handsome and a much darker brown than giacomo, takes a drag off a chesterfield cigarette. through the window behind him, a team of men pour over a partly assembled airplane, their voices echoing in the hangar that surrounds the office. benny measures out his words one at a time.}
<C>__{benny }
<D>__{now... do... you... have... something... to say?}
<A>__{easy swallows his frustration in silence and thinks about swallowing his pride as well. and then:}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{i want my job back, mr. giacomo. i need to work and i need a good job.}
<C>__{benny }
<D>__{is that all?}
<A>__{easy looks down into the smoke and sits up straight to keep from bowing his head.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{no, that's not all... i need money so that i can pay my mortgage and eat... i need a house to live in and a place to raise children... i need to buy clothes so i can }
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{i'm sorry, fella, but i gotta get back to work...}
<A>__{and he swings his feet down and stands up to go. but easy is up too, blocking his way out the door.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{ezekiel, mr. giacomo.}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{hunh?}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{my name is ezekiel... ezekiel rawlins.}
<A>__{benny clinches his fists and focuses on easy's chest like a fighter. and easy rocks back on one foot ready to score a field goal with his right knee. slowly, giacomo's face creases into a plastic grin and he shrugs.}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{s'cuse me, ezekiel.}
<A>__{and he walks around easy, shaking his head as if amused. easy watches him go as the low moan of the baritone sax from duke ellington's "absinthe" snakes up like sin and we}
<T>__{fade to black:}
<A>__{and watch the titles, the last one reading "two weeks later"...}
<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{exterior joppy's bar day}
<A>__{black and grey cars, packards and buicks from 1928 to 1948, come and go on central avenue. two storied storefronts with canvas awnings, above black men and women in hats... all in a hurry. the red car rumbles through and then a white cadillac convertible pulls to the curb in front of a butcher shop. above the shop on the next floor are large partly open windows with joppy's bar in boldface letters. inside sits easy, back to the window reading the classified ads.}
<L>__{interior joppy's bar}
<A>__{t bone walker's "westside baby" plays on the jukebox as easy takes a final drag off his cigarette and stubs it out. the front page of the los angeles times lies face up on the table beneath the ashtray displaying a photograph of a middle aged white man and his pretty young woman companion smiling and waving. above the happy couple is a headline "carter drops out of race"... the caption under the photo reads "wealthy civic leader, todd carter, shown here with his lovely bride to be, daphne monet, at a fundraiser last month was unavailable for comment on his surprising withdrawal from the mayor's race."}
<C>__{o.s. voice}
<D>__{catch ya later, joppy.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{splack! an older black man hitching up his pants underneath a bloodstained butcher's apron has slapped his empty beer glass down hard on the counter on his way out.}
<C>__{joppy}
<D>__{hey, watch the marble! dammit, what'd i tell you?}
<A>__{the fifty year old burly bartender leans over his big stomach checking for cracks and buffing the veiny marble top of the bar with a filthy rag. behind him is a yellow billboard from 1932 with big black letters reading "fuller vs. shag. 10 round main event." we could make out more of the poster and the eight by ten framed boxing photos around it if it wasn't so smoky in the place.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{joppy, how much they payin' out there at mcdonell douglas?}
<C>__{joppy}
<D>__{i don't know. don't it say }
<A>__{his words hang as his eyes stray toward the door. easy looks up also at the doorway which fills with the large frame of the white man in an off white linen suit, his pale eyes surveying the room. satisfied that all but two of the six tables in the tiny room are unoccupied, he smiles at joppy and walks to the far end of the bar. easy is surprised to see joppy, tough ex heavyweight that he is, duck his head and smile as he makes his way over like he's answering a summons. the white man extends a friendly hand and the two of them shake like old friends and lean in close to talk in private. easy finds it hard not to watch their conversation as he takes a sip from a short glass of bourbon on the rocks. after a moment...}
<C>__{joppy}
<D>__{easy, come on over here. this here's somebody i want ya to meet... come on. this here's a friend of mine.}
<A>__{easy drains his glass and stands up, then walks over.}

<D>__{yeah, easy. this here's mr. albright.}

<D>__{you can call me dewitt, easy.}
<A>__{he extends his hand and easy shakes it.}

<D>__{ever seen this guy fight...? any time joppy shag stepped in the ring you knew you were gonna see some real knock down drag out fisticuffs... where you from, easy?}
<C>__{easy}
<P>__{(awkwardly)}
<D>__{houston.}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{houston... joppy's hometown.}
<A>__{joppy pours albright a straight shot of wild turkey and the big man sips it.}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{so i hear you need a job.}
<A>__{easy throws a look at joppy, but joppy is busy buffing the bar and putting more of easy's business in the street.}
<C>__{joppy}
<D>__{aw yeah, easy always tryin' to do better. got his high school certificate from night school. he's threatenin' up on some college. and he's one of the few colored men around here who owns his own house. shoot, he pays a mortgage every month just like a white man.}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{property owner, hunh?}
<A>__{he turns up his drink and sets the empty glass down on the counter.}
<C>__{albright}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{these big companies, don't give a damn, do they?}
<A>__{he reaches in his coat pocket and produces a business card and scribbles something on it.}

<D>__{just somebody i know... a bidness man.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{what kinda business?}
<C>__{joppy}
<D>__{oh, i don't ask him all that. he comes in here every so often looking for somebody to do a little job for him... he pays good.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{in other words, he's a gangster.}
<C>__{joppy}
<D>__{i didn't say that... but if there's a dollar laying in the street i don't think he'll let a little dirt stop him from picking it up. if you worried about making that house note this month, maybe you wanna pay him a call. all them pretty girls you be with ain't gonna buy you a house.}
<A>__{easy cocks his head "are you crazy?"}
<C>__{joppy}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{sound like he just wants you to keep your eyes open for somebody... he'll pay you whether you see anything or not... if it was me i'd take that man's money and go on about my bidness... ain't nothin' to worry about.}
<A>__{easy is still suspicious, but can't take his eyes off the card.}
<C>__{easy }
<D>__{when somebody tells me "don't worry," i usually look down to see if my fly is open... i noticed albright didn't bother to pay for his drink.}

<A>__{a neighbor sweeps out her front porch and waves at easy as he slows down in front of his house.}
<L>__{exterior easy's house day}
<A>__{he gets out of his car and a group of children chasing a man giving goat cart rides, washes past him in the street. a man with an unruly head of hair and full beard pushing a wheelbarrow with a double edged axe wheels up behind easy as he opens his gate.}

<D>__{want me to knock down some of them trees back there for you?}
<C>__{easy}
<P>__{(irritated)}

<A>__{a short and stocky kind of chinese looking man stands against the door at the far end. the tall man ushers easy into the clutter of heavy metal tools, cans of paint and cleaning solutions. a card table with two chairs sits idly. the tall man closes the door and holds out his hand. easy reaches to shake it but the man starts to pat easy on his side and easy pushes him away.}

<A>__{easy follows albright inside and the big man goes behind a big wooden desk and puts his bone colored shoes up next to a half full bottle of wild turkey. on the other end of the desk a small radio scratches out the glen gray orchestra's "gotta be this or that." there is a paper calendar hanging on the wall behind him with a picture of a basket of blackberries, but other than that the room is bare.}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{have a seat, mr. rawlins.}

<C>__{easy}
<D>__{depends on what kind of job. i don't want to get mixed up in nothing.}

<D>__{so you think she might be down in watts.}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{i'm sure of it. but i can't go looking for her myself because i'm not of the right persuasion, so to speak. i've been asking joppy for over a week, but all he could do was introduce me to you.}

<L>__{exterior john's place (market) night}
<A>__{stripped down to its dark, naked self, central avenue has drawn a crowd from all over town. neon glistens off slick pomade and silk clings to the contours of simmering flesh. an outrage to police even before the era of police chief parker's personal crusade, a squad car sits idling while two dicks in blue manhandle a brother in a grey sharkskin zoot suit, prodding and whapping with nightsticks, searching for something anything because his date is a young white woman. a few onlookers stand back watching, but since this white woman is not daphne monet, easy only glances and walks inside.}

<D>__{hey, ezekiel.}
<A>__{miller and mason are waiting outside their car at the curb. they come over.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{you got some mighty powerful friends up there... mighty powerful. but, see, we got a problem.}
<A>__{easy listens disinterestedly.}
<C>__{miller}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{with the chief sealing these things up like this, it doesn't do much for the morale of the men who've been working on these cases.}
<C>__{mason}
<D>__{yeah. makes 'em feel like shit.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{there's a guy who's been callin' on the phone. and we're pretty sure that he was up there with mcgee.}
<C>__{mason}
<D>__{a... uh... colored guy... sounds kinda dumb...}
<C>__{miller}
<P>__{(correcting)}
<D>__{not very bright... but he said you accused him of the murder. and he swears you were up there, too...}
<C>__{mason}
<D>__{in fact, he's out and out pointing the finger at ya.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{how about a name?}
<C>__{mason}
<D>__{he'd do it to you...}
<A>__{easy waits to make sure they're finished, and...}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{sorry, fellas. but i gotta go.}
<A>__{he starts away.}
<C>__{easy}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{why don't you go back to the station and, uh... wait around for my call.}
<C>__{mason}
<D>__{you son of a bitch... you watch yourself, you hear! don't you even spit on the fucking sidewalk... i better not even }
<A>__{mason's voice fades under.}
<C>__{easy }
<D>__{it might be the last moment of my adult life spent free was walking away from city hall.}
<L>__{exterior easy's house day}
<A>__{a newspaper headline reads: "carter back in race." the subheading reads: "quiet civic leader returns as flamboyant teran quits."}
<C>__{easy }
<D>__{the paper treated the mysterious flip flop like it happened every day. and i could tell that matthew teran wouldn't spend a day in jail... back in the second section of the paper was a small article about an unidentified man found dead, slumped over the steering wheel of a white cadillac just north of malibu...}
<A>__{further back, we see that odell is reading the newspaper, nursing a can of ale.}
<C>__{easy }
<D>__{it scared me to think about a world that could kill a man like dewitt albright... what could a world like that do to me?}
<C>__{odell}
<D>__{hey, easy, where's your car?}
<A>__{easy looks up from pulling weeds.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{in the shop... i'm havin' it fixed up a little.}
<C>__{odell}
<D>__{yeah. man can't get no decent job in this town without a car.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{shoot. i ain't studyin' no job.}
<C>__{odell}
<D>__{ain't thinkin' 'bout no job? how you gonna live?}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{i'm gonna go to work for myself. take a little money i got saved up and go into real estate... start fixin' up folks' gardens again... and do a few favors on the side... favors for friends.}
<C>__{odell}
<D>__{what you talkin' 'bout, 'favors'?}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{well, like a woman offered me thirty dollars to go track down her husband for her.}
<C>__{odell}
<D>__{you talkin' about private investigatin' or somethin'... you could get in trouble doin' that.}
<A>__{easy keeps working.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{like a man once said to me, odell: 'walk out your door in the morning and you're already in trouble'... it's just how you're mixed up in that trouble that counts.}
<A>__{easy gets up and turns on the water hose.}
<C>__{easy}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{odell?}
<C>__{odell}
<D>__{yeah, easy...}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{if you got a friend that does bad and you still keep him as your friend, even though you know what he's like... do you think that's right?}
<C>__{odell}
<D>__{all you got is your friends, easy...}
<A>__{easy starts to nod, but then spots}
<B>__{the woodcutter}
<A>__{hovering over a rosebush in a neighbor's yard across the street, his shears ready to cut.}
<C>__{easy}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{get out of that yard!}
<P>__{(to odell)}
<D>__{bastard cut down two of my trees.}
<A>__{easy picks up a rock and sails it. odell comes off the porch and does the same. then a neighbor from across the street joins in. the woodcutter ambles off toward another block, leaving easy, odell and the neighbor gathered in the middle of the street.}
<B>__{up the block}
<A>__{a man with a pony is setting up a camera. a few children have gathered, and more are running over from other parts of the neighborhood. the man props up a hand painted sign, "cowboy pictures 15 cents," and lifts the first customer onto the pony positioning a cowboy hat on the child's head.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{another neighbor joins easy and company, and they continue to laugh and talk, looking up from time to time to wave at friends in passing cars.}
<C>__{easy }
<D>__{i thought about what odell had said about friends and it made sense to me... easy (v.o.) (cont'd) odell goes to church every sunday, so he would know... later on, he challenged me to a game of dominoes. and what'd he do that for? we got to talkin' 'bout texas and fooled around and drunk almost a quart of whiskey... and i forgot about daphne monet, dewitt albright and carter and them... and sat with my friend, on my porch at my house... and we laughed a long time...}
