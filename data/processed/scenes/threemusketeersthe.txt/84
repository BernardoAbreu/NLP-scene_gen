<L>__{interior queen's bath day (later)}
<A>__{anne steps to a dressing chamber, wearing a long robe, arranging her thick wet hair into braids.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{constance, have you seen my...?}
<A>__{anne stops short. cardinal richelieu waits for her in the dressing chamber, now bows, assumes a supplicant air.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{your majesty, forgive me.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{cardinal.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{i need your help. and could not in good conscience wait another minute.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{you want my help?}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{on what matter?}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{your... husband.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(remembering}
<D>__{richelieu's last}
<P>__{encounter with louis)}
<D>__{your king.}
<A>__{richelieu allows the jest, remains silent, watchful. anne resumes, chooses her words with care.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{of course. as your eminence has been kind enough to advise me...}
<P>__{(nods assent)}
<D>__{it's the least i can do.}
<A>__{richelieu reacts with quiet pleasure. he steps closer.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{i am worried about the king's... happiness.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{the huguenot rebellion, occupation in the antilles and cayenne. the coming war with france. these are not the usual hobbies of youth.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{and now he wishes to postpone his birthday celebration.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{he feels it is not... appropriate.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{it sounds as though he is concerned with more important matters.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{which is exactly why we must celebrate.}
<P>__{(off her look)}
<D>__{to show the world that the king of france is strong enough to face any enemy on any field. to show france... that he is king.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he will listen to you. if you will speak.}
<A>__{richelieu makes his case with forceful eloquence, seeming loyalty. anne considers, replies, noncommittal:}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{i will speak to him.}
<A>__{anne senses hidden agenda, intrigues below the surface. the conversation's conspiratorial tone begins to disturb her.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{now, if you'll excuse me, i...}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{anne nods, turns back toward the chambers. richelieu calls after.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{your majesty?}
<P>__{(off her look)}
<D>__{please understand that i do not underestimate the value of your assistance.}
<C>__{richelieu }
<D>__{and that i wish for you to consider in fact, to know all that you and i might accomplish. together.}
<P>__{(quietly, as if to justify)}
<D>__{for france.}
<A>__{richelieu steps away, his red cape swirling behind him. anne feels a chill, pulls her robe more tightly about her body.}
