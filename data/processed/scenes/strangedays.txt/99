<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior elevator and tran's loft}
<A>__{the elevator is huge big enough for a truck and lenny seems small in the huge space, while shadows crawl across his body as the old machinery pulls him up toward... faith, in the loft above. she looks into the vast bedroom... ... at tran sitting in a chair, tranced out under playback trodes, his eyes closed. she softly closes the sliding door and walks across the cavernous main room. the place is lit by the flickering reflections from a series of huge television screens along both walls. otherwise there is little light. the cavernous loft is sparsely but very expensively furnished. haute tech design. total contrast to lenny's ratty digs. lenny's pov through the cage door of the elevator as it reaches the loft and faith is revealed, waiting for him in the shadows. he slides open the cage door and she moves quickly to him.}
<C>__{faith}
<P>__{(whispering, furtive)}
<D>__{you're crazier than i thought, lenny. coming here... tran's just in there.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{iris is dead. she was murdered.}
<A>__{faith stiffens. we see the fear, now, exposed.}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{who did it?}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{don't know. but this guy's real damaged goods. iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.}
<P>__{(he grabs her shoulders)}
<D>__{now no more games, faith. whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. come with me right now. don't even think about it.}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{then what? then what, lenny?! you going to protect me? big tough guy. you're a talker, lenny. you don't even have a gun.}
<C>__{lenny}
<P>__{(hurt)}
<D>__{i have a gun. it's under my bed.}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{you don't know what you're fucking with here.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{tell me.}
<A>__{a voice from the shadows, like the whisper of a blade in the air.}
<C>__{tran}
<D>__{go ahead, faith. tell him.}
<A>__{tran steps forward, totally at ease with the situation. out of the shadows behind him step joey corto, duncan and vita minh.}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{look, tran... lenny just came by to give me some bad news. an old friend of mine has been murdered. you remember iris?}
<C>__{tran}
<D>__{a tragic story, no doubt.}
<P>__{(to lenny)}
<D>__{how'd you get up here?}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{charm.}
<C>__{tran}
<P>__{(looks at faith)}
<D>__{uh huh. look, nero. i will make you an offer.}
<P>__{(he grabs faith by}
<D>__{the arm, steps}
<P>__{closer)}
<D>__{take her. right now. if she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go. i will let her choose. faith always knows what she wants.}
<P>__{(he turns her loose)}
<D>__{hands off. see?}
<A>__{lenny glances at the open elevator right behind him. so close. she just has to take one step to him... and they will be out of there. together.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{it's alright. he means it.}
<C>__{tran}
<P>__{(to faith)}
<D>__{i do mean it.}
<P>__{(to lenny)}
<D>__{and i mean this... if faith stays you go away and never come back. you scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again. you understand?}
<A>__{she glares at them both for a long moment. emotions play across her face, complex and unreadable. she steps back, taking her place at tran's side.}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{i made my choice, lenny.}
<C>__{tran}
<P>__{(to lenny, nodding toward the elevator)}
<D>__{you're going down.}
<A>__{joey corto and duncan shove lenny roughly backward into the elevator. corto slams the gate shut and slaps a button to lower the lift. the last thing lenny sees as he descends is faith's face, above him.}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{i don't love you, lenny. give up.}
