<A>__{moments later mater tows tomber, following finn and holley.}
<C>__{tomber}
<D>__{you rusty piece of junk, get your dirty hook off me!}
<L>__{interior a small garage moments later}
<A>__{finn throws open a door. cars scatter like cockroaches.}
<C>__{finn}
<P>__{(to the cars)}
<D>__{allez! maintenant vite!}
<A>__{mater unhooks an angry tomber who spits in french. finn pulls the door down. as it latches tight }
<C>__{tomber}
<P>__{(to finn)}
<D>__{electroshock! are you kidding me??}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{easy, tomber. this is her first field assignment she didn't know you were my informant.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{informant?}
<C>__{tomber}
<D>__{a rookie, eh? i never liked new car smell.}
<A>__{holley fumes with anger.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{tomber was doing 20 to life in a moroccan impound the first time i saved him, if i recall correctly.}
<C>__{tomber}
<D>__{speaking of recalls, you're getting up there in mileage aren't you, finn?}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{alright, we get it. you both know each other, you're both old. so.}
<A>__{holley shoots a holographic photo of the engine in front of tomber.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{there you go, informant. inform us.}
<A>__{tomber eyes the photo. he recoils, unimpressed.}
<C>__{tomber}
<D>__{that is the worst motor ever made.}
<A>__{suddenly, tomber narrows his gaze.}
<C>__{tomber}
<D>__{wait. that oil filter... those wheel bearings.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{do those parts look familiar, tomber?}
<C>__{tomber}
<D>__{they should. i sold them.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{to whom?}
<C>__{tomber}
<D>__{no idea. he's my best customer, but he always does his business over the phone. i was always wondering why he needs so many parts. now i know.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{well, a lemon needs parts. ain't nothing truer than that.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{"lemon?"}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{yeah, you know. cars that don't ever work right. lemons is a tow truck's bread and butter. like them gremlins and pacers we run into at the party and the race and the airport.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{holley, pull up the pictures from the oil platform. i want to know what other type of cars were out there.}
<A>__{holley complies and suddenly photos of cars from the oil platform hang suspended in the air in front of them.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{right. let's see. there were hugos. and trunkovs.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{mater, are these cars considered lemons?}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{is the popemobile catholic?}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{finn. everyone involved in this plot is one of history's biggest loser cars.}
<A>__{holley refers to the engine photo, which now rises forward as the prominent picture, perhaps the only one in view.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{and they're all taking their orders from the car behind this engine.}
<C>__{tomber}
<D>__{this explains it!}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{what, tomber?}
<C>__{tomber}
<D>__{gremlin, pacer, hugo and trunkovs never get together. but they're having a secret meeting in two days.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{where's this meeting taking place?}
<C>__{tomber}
<D>__{porto corsa, italy.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{that's where the next race is!}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{then there's a good chance our mystery engine will be there too.}
<C>__{tomber}
<D>__{your chances are more than good. i just sent him a new clutch assembly yesterday... to porto corsa.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{holley, contact stephenson and have him meet us at gare de lyon. good work.}
