<C>__{penny}
<D>__{i just found an upside to this mission. the thought of jettisoning your body into deep space.}

<D>__{the jupiter is fully automated. the pilot flies the ship out of the solar system and lands on alpha prime. it's a baby sitting job, sir.}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{major, you are aware earth's resources are severely limited.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{every schoolchild knows our recycling technologies will save the environment. sending a family across the galaxy is a publicity stunt to sell soda to people of all ages.}

<C>__{general}
<D>__{we spun the ad campaign to give the mission a friendly face, keep people from panicking in the streets. we partnered with coke because the 900 billion this mission cost would have bankrupted the government. the sinojordanian alliance knows the truth as well as we do. they hope to reach alpha prime first and if they do, i guarantee you, they will not share the dimondium with western demons like us. our crops will wither. we will be left to die.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{...captain daniels doesn't have the flu, does he sir?}
<C>__{general}

<B>__{pull back to reveal}
<L>__{interior jupiter two engine room future}
<A>__{john and will kneel on the crow's nest as the jupiter two dodges the fire geysers in the sky through the torn hull. the ship is struck once, again, finally exploding in a roaring ball of fire. john close. a man who has lost everything he ever loved.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i couldn't save them.}
<A>__{will stares at his father and beyond him. there, in the time doorway, a young will walks towards the entrance to mission control in the morning sun, innocent with no knowledge of the future.}
<C>__{older will }
<D>__{so many years ago and i can still feel it. our sun. our earth. it's all i've thought about. going home.}
<A>__{will reaches forward and touches the control console. the images in the laser generated doorway begin to change.}
<C>__{older will}
<D>__{a long time ago, you told a small boy that one day he'd understand how precious he was, how much his father loved him. today is that day.}
<A>__{time bubble close. instead of earth we now see this planet's surface, the jupiter two rising as it did just moments ago.}
<C>__{older will}
<D>__{all i could see was your need to go forward at any cost. what you never showed me was your love. i lost that. robbed by time. i could never see how much you cared. until now.}
<A>__{time bubble close. the jupiter two tries in vain to dodge the fire geysers, then exploding all over again. will enters some commands. time bubble close. the image in the portal begins to run backwards, the jupiter two reconstituting from a ball of flame, receding past diminishing flame geysers, beginning to land again.}
<C>__{older will}
<D>__{father, take my hand.}
<L>__{interior cupiter two}
<A>__{we are back in the ship just before take off. don mans the cam. maureen straps herself into the co pilot's chair.}
<C>__{maureen}
<D>__{i kept hoping somehow he'd appear.}
<A>__{maureen stares a beat out the window.}
<C>__{maureen}
<D>__{let's go, major.}
<A>__{don hits the engine switch. the mighty generators whine into life.}
<C>__{maureen}
<P>__{(quiet)}
<D>__{goodbye my love.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{look.}
<A>__{the roof of the hull is beginning to swirl, becoming translucent, like water. there, standing above them, john and older will.}
<L>__{2nt. jupiter two engine room crow's nest future}
<A>__{the bridge of the jupiter two is visible in the laser generated doorway. older will looks to his father.}
<C>__{older will}
<D>__{don't make me wait another lifetime to know how you feel.}
<A>__{and with that he pushes john over the edge, the professor falling down through space and into the bubble and the doorway below.}
<L>__{interior jupiter two}
<A>__{the ceiling becomes water an john drops into the ship. maureen cradles her husband. then she looks up. will is still visible through the watery hull.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{come with us.}
<A>__{but the passage through time and space is already breaking up as the world of the engine room explodes in the b.g.}
<C>__{older will}
<D>__{i can't. there was only enough power for one person, one trip, remember?}
<C>__{maureen}
<D>__{will?}
<C>__{older will}
<D>__{it's good to see you again, mom. it's good to see you alive.}
<P>__{(fading)}
<D>__{sorry about all the monkey business.}
<A>__{maureen reaches up towards her son, reaching down, the two hands almost touching before will is gone, the portal closed forever.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{he sacrificed everything for his family.}
<C>__{maureen}
<P>__{(fighting tears)}
<D>__{he had a good example.}
<A>__{maureen holds him close. a small figure walks up beside them. will.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{dad?}
<A>__{a beat, then will reaches up, hands him his dog tags.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i'm glad you came back.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i just want you to know i love you son. i love you very much.}
<A>__{john takes the boy in his arms, father and son finally holding close. (over) more rumbling as the ground continues to give way.}
<C>__{west }
<D>__{the planet is breaking up around us.}
<A>__{john moves fast to the com.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{nice of you to drop in.}
<A>__{john smiles a beat, then he's all business.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{status?}
<A>__{(over) a tremendous crash.}
<L>__{exterior jupiter two}
<A>__{the land masses are falling away beneath them, plummeting into giant caverns of fire.}
<L>__{interior jupiter two}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{we're doomed. we're doomed.}
<A>__{west turns, hauls off and punches smith, knocking him out cold.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{boy, that felt good.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{get us airborne.}
<A>__{don throws the power switches to full.}
<L>__{exterior jupiter two}
<A>__{the landing struts retract. the power drive begins to spin. the jupiter two rises above the ground just as the firmament collapses upon itself. fire geysers erupt. history in about to repeat itself.}
<L>__{interior jupiter two}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{i'm going to try to reach escape velocity. maybe we can break the gravitational pull.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no. we don't have the core material. the gravity wells will drag us down.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{we might }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{we won't make it. trust me. i know. we've got to go down.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{through the planet as she breaks up.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{that's insane.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i don't have time to argue. i'm giving you a direct order, major.}
<A>__{don and john stare at each other a beat. then don smiles.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<A>__{viewscreen close. the world is breaking up beneath them, revealing a fiery maw. don guns the engines, heading straight for the chasm.}
<L>__{exterior jupiter two}
<A>__{the tiny ship flies into the giant expanding crevice.}
<L>__{interior jupiter two}
<A>__{don is flying into the shattering center of the planet. masses of continents, some bearing forests, others oceans, all soar past.}
<L>__{exterior jupiter two}
<A>__{the tiny ship flies deeper toward the molten center of the planet.}
<L>__{interior jupiter two}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{there.}
<A>__{a window out the windscreen a portion of the planet has torn away revealing the black of space and the starfield beyond.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{i see it.}
<A>__{don banks the ship toward the opening, flying past exploding fragments of this shattering world.}
<L>__{exterior jupiter two}
<A>__{the ship clears the planet as the world explodes in the b.g. chapter 24: alpha prime }
<L>__{interior jupiter two}
<A>__{don guides the ship out into space. judy comes up behind him.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{nice work, flyboy.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{so, i earn that kiss yet?}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(a peck on the cheek)}
<D>__{you earned that.}
<A>__{don shrugs, begins to turn away. judy grabs him.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{this one is on credit.}
<A>__{she gives him a long, passionate kiss. she lets him go, stunned.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{cold fish, huh?}
<A>__{penny holds blip in her arms, who has begun to blip madly.}
<C>__{maureen}
<D>__{poor thing. she's lost her whole family.}
<P>__{(off penny)}
<D>__{penny, why are you looking at me like that. penny?}
<A>__{penny presses a button. blast doors open on a storage hold.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{i promised judy i'd take care of her. i couldn't leave her all alone.}
<A>__{(all stare at her)}
<D>__{well i am their princess, after all.}
<P>__{(turning)}
<D>__{you can come out mow.}
<A>__{forms in the cargo hold de camouflage. the other lizard monkeys, standing amidst glittering canisters of dimondium.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{dimondium. now if we could only find our way back to earth.}
<C>__{robot}
<D>__{if i may, professor.}
<A>__{the robot projects a holographic schematic of the galaxy. the jupiter two is highlighted. earth blinks at the other and.}
<C>__{robot}
<D>__{your son's star charts.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{it's a map home.}
<A>__{(over) alarms. the shattered planet's core is turning bright red, a sudden roaring blast wave heading towards the ship.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{the planet's gravity field in collapsing.}
<C>__{maureen}
<D>__{we'll be sucked in.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{there's no way to get clear in time.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{the hyperdrive.}
<C>__{maureen}
<D>__{everybody hang on.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{here we go again.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{cool.}
<A>__{don throws the switch.}
<L>__{exterior jupiter two}
<A>__{the planet's core explodes as the jupiter two vanishes into hyperspace, a sudden star and then gone.}
