<L>__{interior mickey's apartment day}
<A>__{the screen shows a chaise in mickey's apartment; an ashtray on a stand sits nearby. the camera moves down the chaise, past several piles of books, to mickey's coffee table. he sits, picking at his fingers and listening, on the edge of the table in front of holly, who is sitting cross legged on the floor, propped up with a pillow, reading her script aloud.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(offscreen, as the}
<D>__{camera moves across the room towards her}
<P>__{and mickey, reading)}
<D>__{"we all go through life playing the hand we're dealt. craig: and what hand were you dealt?}
<P>__{(onscreen now)}
<D>__{"emily: i'm two high pair, maybe even aces up. the problem is, you've got three deuces."}
<A>__{holly closes the script and looks up at mickey.}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{that's the end.}
<A>__{mickey smiles and shrugs, not knowing what to say.}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{no, you can tell me straight. it's okay. just, you know, tell me what you think.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(shaking his head, shrugging)}
<D>__{it's great. i swea i'm i'm, tch, i'm speechless. i was...i was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{i don't know what to say. i'm moved and i laughed and i uh, i, you know, i was on the edge of my seat. i just think it's wonderful! i'm, i'm totally...stunned. this is not an insult. i'm amazed that you can...}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{it was i just thought it was great.}

<P>__{(reacting)}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(grunting and gesturing)}
<D>__{yes! i was abso and...w what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and and the ex wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(laughing and nodding)}
<D>__{oh, it just came to me one day.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{well, it was just fabulous! i'm, i, you know...}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(gasping, hitting her forehead with her hand)}
<D>__{oh, gosh, you really think i can write?}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{i thought it was wonder there's maybe one or two things in there that i would do differently myself, but...}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(gasping and nodding)}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{...but who cares? it was just }
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{it was fabulous.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(chuckling)}
<D>__{oh!}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(smiling and shaking his head)}
<D>__{fabulous, i mean it! i'm so impressed.}
<A>__{holly, thrilled with mickey's overwhelming response, stands up, her hand on her head. unable to contain herself, she begins to walk up and down the room, holding her script. the camera follows her; mickey is now offscreen.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{oh, god!}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(offscreen, overlapping)}
<D>__{i am. you you made my day.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(gasping)}
<D>__{oh, wow!}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{it was just great. uh, i was all set...i was set to be bored stiff.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(grinning, looking at the offscreen mickey)}
<D>__{uh, gee. would you like to have lunch? uh, uh...}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{i i would love to talk to you about, uh, that script. i i, you know, i think maybe that we could do something with it.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{okay, and listen, i would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{oh, who cares?}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{y you used to oh, no! yeah, i care. you used to be so ambitious and...}
<P>__{(pausing, grinning)}
<D>__{god, you really liked it?!}
<A>__{"you made me love you" starts to play as the movie cuts to the street outside mickey's apartment house, an old building complete with a red entrance door and a gray, weather beaten facade. trees line the sidewalk. holly and mickey emerge from the door and walk up the street, revealing a whole row of similar apartment buildings. they pass a few other people as they walk. the film then moves to the outside of a charming glass and stainedwood cafe. through the window, holly and mickey can be seen having lunch. holly is talking animatedly; mickey takes a sip of coffee. some people pass by. next, the film cuts to an almost isolated path in central park, complete, with old fashioned streetlamps and scattered leaves. holly and mickey stroll into view, deep in conversation.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that? h how did you get over it? i mean, when i ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine. well, you seem fine now.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{well...}
<P>__{(chuckling)}
<D>__{i will tell you.}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{one day about a month ago...}
<A>__{the film abruptly cuts to mickey's flashback, a visual counterpoint to the story he is telling holly. a close up of a nervous, perspiring, and panting mickey alone in his apartment appears on the screen as his voice is heard.}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{...i really hit bottom. you know, i just felt that in a godless universe, i didn't want to go on living. now i happen to own this rifle...}
<P>__{(coughing)}
<A>__{mickey raises the barrel of a rifle to his forehead. he shuts his eyes tightly.}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{...which i loaded, believe it or not, and pressed it to my forehead. and i remember thinking, at the time, i'm gonna kill myself. then i thought...what if i'm wrong? what if there is a god? i mean, after all, nobody really knows that.}
<A>__{the camera moves past the desperate mickey to a mirror on the wall behind him. its reflection shows his spiral staircase and some standing lamps. a clock faintly ticks.}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{but then i thought, no. you know, maybe is not good enough. i want certainty or nothing. and i remember very clearly the clock was ticking, and i was sitting there frozen, with the gun to my head, debating whether to shoot.}
<A>__{the gun goes off with a loud bang. the mirror shatters.}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{all of a sudden, the gun went off.}
<A>__{mickey, holding the rifle, is seen running over to the shattered mirror. the sounds of his excited neighbors, their shouting, a knocking door, are heard as he continues his tale.}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{i had been so tense, my finger had squeezed the trigger inadvertently... neighbor #1}
<P>__{(offscreen, overlapping)}
<D>__{what's happening? wh wh what's going on?}
<C>__{mickey }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{...but i was perspiring so much, the gun had slid off my forehead and missed me. neighbor #2}
<P>__{(offscreen, overlapping)}
<D>__{i don't know. i heard a gun. is everything all right?}
<A>__{mickey, still brandishing the rifle, runs into his sunlit living room. he looks around frantically, his shirt loose. finally, he throws the rifle down between the sofa and the coffee table. the gun goes off a second time. mickey, standing nearby, jumps, his hands flying to his head. the doorbell rings; the neighbors begin pounding at the door.}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{and suddenly, neighbors were, were, pounding on the door, and and i don't know, the whole scene was just pandemonium. and, uh, you know, and i i i i i ran to the door.}
<A>__{mickey runs offscreen briefly to answer the door.}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{i i i i didn't know what to say. you know, i was, i was embarrassed and confused, and my my my mind was r r racing a mile a minute...}
<A>__{he returns onscreen, panting; he looks frantically once again around the living room.}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{...and i i jus knew one thing.}
<A>__{the film cuts to a west side street. it's an overcast day. mickey, walking slowly along the sidewalk, passes several other pedestrians and numerous storefronts, including klein's pharmacy and a "bar b q" take out. occasionally, he is obscured by a tree trunk on the opposite side of the street; a few taxis go by as he talks over the scene.}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{i...i i i i had to get out of that house. i had to just get out in the fresh air and and clear my head. and i remember very clearly. i walked the streets. i walked and i walked. i i didn't know what was going through my mind. it all seemed so violent and un unreal to me. and i wandered...}
<A>__{the movie cuts to the exterior of the metro movie theater, with its smoked glass entrance doors and its art deco feel. an old publicity photo hangs inside. mickey's reflection is seen at the almost transparent doors, as well as the reflection of the street and various cars whizzing by. his reflection walks towards the theater entrance; he continues his story.}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{...for a long time on the upper west side, you know, an and it must have been hours! you know, my, my feet hurt. my head was, was pounding, and, and i had to sit down. i went into a movie house. i i didn't know what was playing or anything.}
<A>__{mickey walks into the movie house. he is seen through the glass doors, which still reflect the street and traffic outside. he makes his way through the lobby into the actual theater.}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{i just, i just needed a moment to gather my thoughts and, and be logical, and, and put the world back into rational perspective.}
<A>__{the film abruptly cuts to the theater's black and white screen, where the marx brothers, in duck soup, play the helmets of several soldiers standing in a line like a live xylophone. the sounds of the "xylophone" are heard as the movie cuts to the darkened theater, where mickey slowly sits down in a balcony seat. the "xylophone" music stops and changes to "hidee hidee hidee hidee hidee hidee ho" as sung by the marx brothers and ensemble in the movie. the singing continues faintly in the background as mickey continues his tale:}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{and i went upstairs to the balcony, and i sat down}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{and, you know, the movie was a a a film that i'd seen many times in my life since i was a kid, an and i always u uh, loved it. and, you know, i'm, i'm watching these people up on the screen, and i started getting hooked o on the film, you know?}
<A>__{the film cuts back to the black and white movie screen as mickey continues to talk. the marx brothers, as well as the hundred odd other cast members in duck soup, are kneeling and bowing as they sing "hidee hidee ho." they kick their heels up in the air. they sway back and forth, hands clasped, singing "oh h h h h h..."}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{...and i started to feel how can you even think of killing yourself? i mean, isn't it so stupid? i mean, l look at all the people up there on the screen. you know, they're real funny, and, and what if the worst is true?}
<A>__{the movie cuts back to mickey, sitting almost obscured in the dark theater. the oh h h h h h's coming from the offscreen movie are heard as he continues to speak.}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{what if there's no god, and you only go around once and that's it? well, you know, don't you want to be part of the experience? you know, what the hell, it i it's not all a drag. and i'm thinking to myself, geez, i should stop ruining my life...}
<A>__{as mickey talks, the film cuts back to the antics of the marx brothers on the black and white theater screen. the four brothers are now swaying and singing and strutting, their voices indistinct over mickey's narration.}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{...searching for answers i'm never gonna get, and just enjoy it while it lasts. and...you know...}
<A>__{the film is back on mickey's dark form in the audience.}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{...after, who knows? i mean, you know, maybe there is something. nobody really knows. i know, i know "maybe" is a very slim reed to hang your whole life on, but that's the best we have. and...then, i started to sit back, and i actually began to enjoy myself.}
<A>__{as mickey continues, the film cuts back to duck soup on the black and white screen. the marx brothers are sitting on a judge's bench, playing banjos and singing with the other cast members. they jump down from the bench, still singing. their voices swell.}
<D>__{marx brothers & company "oh, freedonia oh, don't you cry for me they'll be coming around the mountain..."}
<A>__{the marx brothers kneel, strumming their banjos, and the movie cuts back to central park. the flashback is over. mickey and holly continue their stroll as "you made me love you" begins to play in the background. they pass some people, a cluster of buildings that look like castles, and the manhattan skyline as seen through the trees, as the camera moves back, farther and farther away from them, showing a beautiful central park, frozen in time.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{um...look, there's something i've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and i just thought i'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and}
<P>__{(chuckling)}
<D>__{that's this.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(mumbling)}
<D>__{oh, yeah? what?}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{that i've always regretted the way i behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...i've, i just thought i'd tell you that because i really made a fool out of myself.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{oh, don't be silly! no! don't be ridiculous.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{it's all right.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{i was the, i was... you know, it was my fault. i }
<P>__{(inhaling)}
<A>__{holly laughs.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{so, so you want to go out to dinner again? i mean, is that, is that... have, you have any interest in that, or...}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{sure. sure, uh, yes.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{do you? i mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{they stroll offscreen. "you made me love you" grows louder and the film cuts to:}
<D>__{one year later.}
