<L>__{exterior plane crash site}
<A>__{the five survivors search through the wreckage, trying to find anything useful. the task is grim. mindful of grant's warnings, they move quickly and quietly. udesky picks up a gun out of the swampy water. the barrel is bent almost 90 degrees, unless. billy finds his camera, intact. digging a change of clothes out of his suitcase, paul steps around the side of the plane to change. he's in his underwear before he notices amanda is also there changing.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{nothing you haven't seen before.}
<A>__{a beat. amanda looks over as they get dressed.}
<C>__{amanda }
<D>__{how much weight have you lost?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{twenty, twenty fire pounds. i've been swimming at the y.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{you hate to swim.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{people change.}
<A>__{a nod to mean, that's the truth.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{you look good.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{so do you.}
<A>__{they make brief eye contact, which amanda breaks. around the side, billy is taking photos of a giant footprint the dinosaur left in the mud during its attack on the plane. grant looks over.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{how would you classify it?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{obviously a superpredator.}
<P>__{(best guess)}
<D>__{suchimimus. that snout.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{they never got that big.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{baryonyx?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{not with that sail.}
<P>__{(billy gives up)}
<D>__{spinosaurus aegypticus.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{i don't remember that on ingen's list.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{that's because it wasn't on their list. who knows what else they were up to?}
<A>__{billy looks past grant to see paul approaching. he's struggling with the straps on his backpack. turning in circles. billy regards him with suspicion.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{so mr. kirby, tell me, when you climbed k2, did you base camp at 25 or 30,000 feet?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{thirty thousand, i think. closer to the top.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{about a thousand feet above it, actually.}
<P>__{(closer)}
<D>__{most mountain climbers remember how tall that mountains were.}
<A>__{paul knows he's caught.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{there is no kirby enterprises, is there?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{there is. i own a place called kirby paint and title plus. we're out in the westgate shopping center in enid, oklahoma. the "plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces accessories, patio furniture. stuff like that.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{i don't suppose that check you wrote us is any good.}
<C>__{udesky}
<D>__{he paid us half up front. cash.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{mortgaged everything we had to do it. even the store. and if we make it off this island with my son, i swear, i will make good on the money i owe you. i don't care if it takes me the rest of my life.}
<A>__{grant and udesky exchange a dubious glance.}
<C>__{udesky}
<D>__{however long that is.}
