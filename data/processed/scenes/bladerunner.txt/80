<L>__{interior sebastian's apartment day}
<A>__{batty, pris and mary sit at the table staring at their host. sebastian is staring back, his fork halfway to his mouth, looking from face to face. although nothing is being said, he's totally comfortable, as much at home with them as he is with his animoids.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{why are you staring at us?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{you're just all so... so different.}
<A>__{batty nods his head, smiling, sending home the fact and sebastian is certainly getting it.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{what, sebastian?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{you're androids.}
<A>__{a long pause.}
<C>__{pris}
<D>__{what makes you think so?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{you're all so perfect.}
<A>__{sebastian is smiling from ear to ear.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{what generation are you?}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{nexus 6.}
<A>__{sebastian whistles. mary's head is shaking slightly. pris gets up and moves to the couch. batty couldn't be more pleased.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{we can trust sebastian, ladies. he's been working with mechanisms all his life. he's a wizard and a very perceptive man.}
<A>__{sebastian looks like a kid on christmas eve.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{could you...}
<A>__{his voice is trembling.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{show me something?}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{like...}
<A>__{like a million things, but he's too excited to think of one.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{we're not computers, sebastian, we're physical.}
<A>__{pris perks up proudly.}
<C>__{pris}
<D>__{i think, therefore i am.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{very good, pris. now show him why.}
<A>__{it's a command pris is pleased to obey. she sits quiet ly a moment, hands folded in her lap, prim and proper. mary doesn't like these displays, but batty is beaming. those hands in pris' lap suddenly move, almost faster than the eye can see and slam down on either side of her, digging into the material with such ferocity that sebastian jumps. she plunges into the guts of the couch up to her elbows and comes up holding springs and stuff ing. except for the clenched teeth, she is smiling like an angel. sebastian is riveted, his eyes wide and astounded, like he's just seen the devil. he laughs nervously, glad that the devil is a friend.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{we have a lot in common.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{you mean that you can't come here and i can't go there?}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{not only that, but we have smiliar problems. accelerated decrepitude. but we don't want to die quite yet.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{of course not.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{you could help us.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i don't know much about biomechanics, roy. i wish i did, but you're out of my league.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{if we don't find help soon, pris hasn't got long to live.}
<A>__{sebastian sneaks a glance. pris is staring at him with big childlike eyes, sebastian looks back at batty, moved but helpless.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{what about your friend, the man who owns this building?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{dr. tyrell?}
<A>__{batty nods.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{he's not really my friend. i just do a job for him now and then.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{tyrell could help us, sebastian.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{he could?}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{his company made us.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i'd be happy to mention it to him.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{be better if i could talk to him in person. but he's not an easy man to get to.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{when do you deliver your project?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{this afternoon.}
<A>__{batty leans forward and looks right into sebastian's eyes.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{will you help us?}
<A>__{there's no way sebastian could say no, even if he wanted to.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{pris sits up smiling. mary sighs a breath of relief and batty leans back nodding in gratitude.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{i'm sure glad you found us, sebastian. what do you think, mary?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{pris?}
<A>__{pris gets up and comes to sebastian and kisses him. that has a lot of impact. sebastian looks around try ing to keep the tears from coming.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{you're our best and only friend.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{thank you.}
