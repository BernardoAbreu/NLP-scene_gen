<D>__{you know the kind of woman that just screams trouble? you see her and every warning bell in your brain starts going off but you still ask for her number? well that's all i ever hook up with. but this betty blew 'em all away in the shitstorm sweepstakes.}
<A>__{king reaches out to a keyboard, calling up a piece of surveillance footage on a nearby monitor. the footage features asher and danica and grimwood. it's been slowed to a near standstill and now advances frame by frame.}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{her name's danica talos. you met her earlier. the man on her left is asher, her brother.}
<A>__{king types a command. the image zooms in, tracking grimwood.}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{the neanderthal behind them is jarko grimwood.}
<A>__{king freezes the footage on danica's grainy, pixelated face.}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{i picked danica up in a bar, had a one night stand with her then spent the next five years playing step and fetch it as her little vampire cabana boy.}

<C>__{blade}
<D>__{you gotta be kidding me.}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{he's real, blade. dig beneath all the movies and myths. all the layers of bullshit that've cluttered our culture for the last five hundred years and eventually you'll strike the truth.}
<C>__{blade}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{so the movies are true?}
<C>__{king}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{the movies are just a comforting fairytale compared to the real deal. there's no happy ending with this guy. peter cushing isn't going to run in at the last second and save the day with a cross and some holy water.}
<P>__{(re: the comicbook)}
<D>__{see, good old brain stoker, he wrote a nice yarn. but the events he described in 1897 were only a tiny piece of the mosaic. the rea1 dracula's origin goes back much earlier than that.}
