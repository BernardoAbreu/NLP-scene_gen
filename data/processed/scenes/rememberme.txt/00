<L>__{exterior smith street station brooklyn night}
<A>__{it's very late. it's quiet. just the sounds of the city linda santana craig, an attractive hispanic woman in her thirties, waits at the elevated station for the f train. linda looks great. she's dressed festively but tastefully. next to her is her eleven year old daughter, alicia. she is twirling about the platform, still jazzed from the birthday party they attended in the city. alicia wears a black dress with a pink cardigan and has a pink handbag. we notice a charm bracelet with four leaf clovers on her right wrist. the mother and daughter wait alone at one end of the station platform. two teenage boys wait at the other end. they speak soft, slurred spanish to each other. linda gives the boys a glance and evaluates. she watches them as alicia spits a wad of gum into her mom's open hand. the boys approach. linda tenses. at the last second the boys make a hard left turn and disappear down the stairwell. it's quiet again. linda relaxes, smiles at her daughter. the f train is rounding the final bend into the station. their focus is on this train. it's getting closer, louder. and so they don't see, don't hear the boys coming back up the stairwell behind them. not until the boys have the mother and daughter boxed in and the one who can hardly grow a mustache is showing them his gun. linda puts her arm around her daughter. alicia looks terrified. the train roars into the station as linda quickly hands over her purse, her watch. she hands over her engagement ring and her wedding band. one of the boys yanks alicia's little purse away from her. the other boy fumbles the wedding band. the ring clangs to the ground and rolls to a stop a few feet away. we hear men's voices echoing up the stairwell. now the boys are boxed in. and starting to panic. the train doors slide open . the boys see their way out and step into the last empty rail car, leaving the mother and daughter alone on the platform. through the window on the train, linda stares at the boy holding her daughter's purse, her face hardening into a mask}

<A>__{the boy clocks it. who does she think she is? the train doors begin to close when a hand with tattooed knuckles reaches out and stops the car doors from closing. a forearm and gun extend out of that last subway car ... there's a muzzle flash... a distant pop... a cloud of smoke ... a mist of blood... and linda's body collapses on itself. alicia's face, shock, terror and blood.}
