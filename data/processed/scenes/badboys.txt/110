<A>__{burnett and lowrey on the move.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{if you were a real partner, instead of some no backup, hot doggin', car chasin', skirt sniffin' motherfucker, i would be gettin' down to business with my wife instead of stuck in this situation.}
<C>__{lowrey}
<D>__{yeah. thanks for the get well card.}
<L>__{interior police basketball gym}
<A>__{howard is in sweats, awkwardly shooting free throws as his morning workout. parked on either side of the hoop, lowrey and burnett patiently retrieve each missed ball and send it back to him.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{chief. i tried to set the girl up with a sketch artist but she won't. i tried to get her to come in and look at the mug books and she won't come in.}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{she'll only deal with mike lowrey.}
<A>__{he tosses a brick.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{that's right. so let her deal with the real mike lowrey! who, i might add, shoulda been there to take the call instead of runnin' off like a hot dog without any backup.}
<A>__{howard fires another missed shot. he's so bad, it's all burnett and lowrey can do to keep from spiking the ball.}
<C>__{lowrey}
<D>__{hey. i'm not the one who left a strange hooker alone in my apartment. you know, she's probably on the street sellin' all my shit as we speak.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{i had to stash her somewhere! she's scared shitless... just like her dogs.}
<C>__{lowrey}
<D>__{dogs, too? i got persian rugs, man. i'm going home... explain the whole thing, take her to the motel six, she'll understand...}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{not a good idea.}
<P>__{(brick)}
<D>__{until she i.d.s the shotters, he's mike lowrey. could take a coupla hours. could take all day. you got a computer with a modem?}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{big computer. expensive }
<C>__{lowrey}
<D>__{yeah, i got a computer and you shouldn't touch it. it took me weeks to get it set up the way i want it and i don't want amateurs messing with it.}
<C>__{howard}
<P>__{(brick number four)}
<D>__{burnett. i will have francine give you the user code for the computer files and you can run pictures for the girl on lowrey's super duper computer.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{so what about me? i can't tell my wife i'm shacked up with a female witness! besides, i think they made my car last night... i gotta stay close to home, just in case.}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{easy. lowrey moves into your house. and you're on special assignment.}
<A>__{another brick.}
<C>__{lowrey}
<D>__{no way! i'm not living in that zoo.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{my house ain't no zoo!}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{enough! you're him, he's you! until she makes the shooters and we get the dope back, i don't care what you have to do, just make it work!}
<A>__{lowrey and burnett feel hammered by howard. upon retrieving his final brick, lowrey passes to burnett, who feeds back lowrey with a heel kick to the rim. and lowrey slams the ball home. they exit with howard simply staring.}
