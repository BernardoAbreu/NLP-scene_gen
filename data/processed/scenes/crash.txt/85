<L>__{interior vaughan's car night}
<A>__{we are close on the fresh tattoo on james's inner thigh. it looks more like a cartoon version of a wound than a real wound. we can see it because james's trousers are down around his knees. vaughan's face comes into frame. he gently kisses the tattoo. james lifts vaughan's face to his own and kisses his mouth, touches his tongue to each of the scars around vaughan's mouth.}
