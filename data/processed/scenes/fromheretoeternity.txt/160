<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior living room of alma's house night}
<B>__{medium shot prew}
<A>__{there are improvised blackout curtains over windows and the glass doors. the radio is on, volume low, and an announcer (not the one of the morning) is droning out an account of pearl harbor. prew, still on the couch in his pajamas, looks as if he has just struggled to wakefulness. he listens to the radio for a few moments in confused disbelief. he shakes his head vigorously as if to throw off his grogginess. he shakes his head again, slowly, more knowingly now, nodding as if he remembers something from the broadcast of the morning. then as if all of it hits him suddenly and fully and terribly he wrenches himself off the couch. he looks around at the dimly lit room.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{alma! alma!}
<A>__{he goes to the blackout curtains, peeps out. then he turns back to listen to the radio. abruptly, he runs into the bedroom.}
<C>__{prew's voice}
<D>__{alma!}
<A>__{the room remains empty for a few moments as the radio announcer goes on, continuing previous remarks.}
<C>__{radio announcer's voice}
<D>__{ ready to fight and die for us, our regular army and navy have this day upheld the faith and confidence we have always placed in them. they have proved their right to the esteem we have always had for them...}
<A>__{prew comes back into the room. he has his shoes on, holds civilian shirt and pants in his hand. he starts to put them on hurriedly, his attention still focused on the broadcast. the front door opens and alma and gorgette enter. they are surprised to see prew up. he nods at them, turns back quickly to listen to the radio as he continues dressing.}
<C>__{radio announcer's voice}
<D>__{... the attack caused serious damage to many installations of which pearl harbor suffered the worst.}
<C>__{radio announcer's voice}
<D>__{we will not forget this day and we will never let the japanese forget it...}
<C>__{prew}
<P>__{(yells at radio)}
<D>__{you said it! who they think they're fight in?}
<P>__{(incoherent with rage; to girls)}
<D>__{they're pickin trouble with the best army in the best riflemen you know we the ony country on the face of the earth that uses the shooting gunsling, not the carrying gunsling. you know that?}
<A>__{the radio continues on under the scene. alma and gorgette speak breathlessly, in a rush.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{we've been at queens hospital giving blood }
<C>__{gorgette}
<D>__{the town's a madhouse. trucks, busses, jeeps all over }

<D>__{a house on kuhio street was bombed out }
<C>__{gorgette}
<D>__{and the drugstore on mckully and king is smashed flat. and the man and his wife were killed }
<A>__{prew gestures to radio as if he's heard all about it. he sticks his shirttails into his trousers.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{i gotta get back to the post i will try to get in touch with you in a couple days }
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{the post? tonight?}
<A>__{prew nods vehemently, moves across room to a table.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{but why?}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{why? there's a war goin on.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{but you can't! you're not fit yet you're weak as a kitten you're awol they'll throw you in the stockade }
<C>__{prep}
<P>__{(laughs wildly)}
<D>__{they'll be throwin `em out of the stockade. they need every man they can get.}
<A>__{he picks up the sheet of paper with the "re enlistment blues" written out on it, starts to fold it. desperation is reflected on alma's face; she turns to gorgette, as if pleading for aid,}
<C>__{gorgette}
<D>__{your side'll open up }
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{and they'll find out it was you who killed that soldier!}
<A>__{prew shakes his head, as if obsessed by only one thought.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{once i report in to the compny i will be all right. once i get there. i gotta get back }
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{but you'll never make it! there's mps all over }
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{i will make it. i will go along the back roads. they'll let me in the west gate they'll know i'm a soljer }
<A>__{he puts the folded piece of paper in his pocket and starts for the door.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{stay till morning!}
<A>__{prew glances at alma incredulously. she sobs suddenly, violently.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{maybe if you stayed till morning you'd change your mind...}
<A>__{she throws her arms around him, clings to him.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{don't go, prew! i will do whatever you want... we'll figure out a way to get to the states together... we can even get married... if you go i won't see you any more... i know it...}
<A>__{prew holds her closely for a moment, then moves her away from him. he turns toward the door.}
<C>__{alma}
<P>__{(tears turning to hysteria)}
<D>__{what do you want to go back to the army for?! what did the army ever do for you? besides treat you like scum and give you one awful going over and get your friend killed? what do you want to go back to that for?}
<A>__{prew frowns as if he's not sure he heard correctly.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{what do i want to go back for? i'm a soljer.}
<C>__{alma}
<P>__{(laughing wildly)}
<D>__{a soldier! a soldier! a regular. from the regular army. a thirty year man!}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{sure. a thirty year man.}
