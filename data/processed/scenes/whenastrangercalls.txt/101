<A>__{dark. a little boy is lying in bed, apparently asleep. this is curt duncan as a child. some voices approach in the hallway outside the bedroom. they are gruff, with heavy english accents, but subdued; a man and a woman, well into middle age. the boy's eyes open as he listens:}

<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{save it for later. let's go out and get some food.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{what about the lad? you can't leave him.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{curt's asleep. he'll never know we're gone.}
<A>__{from outside, a key enters the lock of the bedroom door and turns. the bolt slips and the door is securely shut. the boy sits up in bed, apprehensive. in tight shots of the floor we see a rat come out from under the bed, then another. they make "chit chit" noises as they begin to explore. one of them maybe goes up on its hind legs and nibbles on the bedpost. then we see two more rats appear. we go for a tight shot of the boy on top of the bed. the "chit chit" noises grow steadily louder as the boy's apprehension turns to fear, then to terror. the boy starts to whimper. suddenly, we cut back to a wide shot of the room. the floor is crawling with rats, hundreds of them. the "chit chit" rises to practically a roar as the boy, alone on top of the bed, begins to wail. the room seems to darken, and the boy becomes just a little white speck in it. the focus is turned. the picture becomes a black and white blur.}
