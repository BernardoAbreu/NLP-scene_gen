<L>__{interior sykes' apartment night}
<A>__{sykes enters his apartment, an untidy bachelor place decorated with negative taste. it's obviously the maid's decade off. by rote, he hits the rewind switch on the answering machine on his way into the kitchen. the tape rewinds. he opens the fridge. not much here. left over take out pizza carton. left over take out chinese food cartons. left over take out burger wrappers. the answering machine message begins he glances over his shoulder as he hears his daughter's voice. during the following, he reaches the fridge. brings out a milk carton that's in his way, sets it on the counter. reaches in again and this time brings out a bottle of stoly. then searches for a semi clean glass.}

<P>__{(bouncy, bride to be happy)}
<D>__{hi, daddy, it's me. i'm over at danny's parents' house... talking about sunday. i thought maybe you'd be home by now. anyway, uh, nothing really. i just wanted to call and say i love you. i love you, daddy.}
<P>__{(she giggles)}
<D>__{uh oh, i shouldn't'a done that. knowing you, you'll probably pull this tape out of your machine and save it in that drawer where you keep every card i ever gave you, and all of my old baby teeth... gross! anyway, daddy, don't save this tape but i do love you, and i will talk to you before sunday.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{oh, tug and carol came by and met danny last week.}
<P>__{(sykes stiffens)}
<D>__{danny thought tug was the greatest but, then, who doesn't? anyway, love you, talk to you soon. 'bye.}
<A>__{the machine beeps and hisses. sykes take the glass and the bottle of vodka, crosses back toward the living room, switching off the answering machine as he goes. then he stops, turns back, takes the message tape out of the machine and tosses it into a drawer.}
