<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior parking lot dim sum joint little tokyo night}
<A>__{neon reflections on the roof of mace's limo as it pulls into the lot and slides up to max's car. max is sitting in the open door, feet on the pavement, eating dumplings from a take out carton. he looks up as lenny and mace get out of the limo. sees their expressions.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{ohhhh shit.}
<A>__{time cut: lenny, sitting on the hood of mace's lincoln, has his head propped in his hands. his eyes are distant... replaying. still shocked to his soul. mace paces nearby. max sits in the open door of his car ten feet away, trodes on, playing back the tape. his face is transformed into an ashen mask lit by neon... mouth open in shock. with shaky hands he stops the deck. opens his eyes. long beat. he glances down at the dim sum carton in his hands.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{well... i've lost my appetite.}
<P>__{(lofts it into a nearby dumpster)}
<D>__{for about a year.}
<A>__{he gets to his feet, offering the deck and trodes to mace.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{no way.}
<A>__{max pulls a hip flask full of tequila from his army jacket and takes an eye watering pull. offers it to lenny, who follows suit.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you alright? y'okay?}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{yeah. no, not really.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{let's work it.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{not now... i don't want to think about it }
<C>__{max}
<D>__{come on, lenny. you used to be good at this stuff. play it down. what's the perp doing?}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{he stalks her. he rapes her. then he does her...}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{and he records it. thrill kill. wants to see it again. and again.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{he records himself raping and killing her }
<C>__{max}
<D>__{but at the same time he's sending the signal to her }
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{so she feels... what he feels... while he's in her. the thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.}
<P>__{(turns to him)}
<D>__{i've seen a lot, max.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{so've i. too much.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{but this is a bad one.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{top ten.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{he makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging. and he records it all.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{and gives it to you.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{wants to share.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{that's right. he wants to share. needs an audience. this is one sick puppy.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{why me?}
<A>__{mace is hugging herself. edgy and tense.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{cause you're the man, right? the magic man. if it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{i've never dealt in black jacks. never. everybody knows that.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{he's skull fucking you, bud. trying to get a reaction. maybe pushing you to do something.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{maybe he just figures lenny will appreciate what he's created. it's the dark end of the street, lenny. how do you like it now?}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{jesus, mace. back off.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{this guy is someone you know, one of your squid head contacts.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{problem is, lenny knows everybody.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{take the tape to the cops.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{uh unh. no way! they'd crucify me.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{so some psycho wire freak gets to keep running around }
<C>__{max}
<D>__{naw, he's right. they'll figure lenny's the perp, or go through his client list, ruin his life... such as it is. look, i will call the guys in homicide... tell them she was a friend of mine and they'll keep me in the loop. get me the forensics and all that.}
<P>__{(he opens his car door)}
<D>__{get some sleep. i will call you when i get something.}
<P>__{(he starts his car)}
<D>__{and lenny... i'd keep moving if i were you.}
