<P>__{(sympathetic smile)}

<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(answering)}
<D>__{pioneer lodge?...}
<P>__{(listens)}
<D>__{hold on a second. he's right here.}
<A>__{will stops. turns. rachel holds up the phone. covering the mouthpiece.}
<C>__{rachel }
<D>__{john warfield. he's called a couple of times.}
<A>__{will's stomach drops. that's the last phone call in the world he wants to take. rachel reads his face.}

<C>__{will}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{dormer.}
<A>__{pause. a bemused voice on the other end.}
<C>__{warfield's voice}
<D>__{detective dormer. i've been trying to reach you. i was very sorry to hear about your partner, detective eckhart. it must have been a terrible shock, what happened this morning.}
<A>__{will. not giving this asshole an inch. rachel, trying not to listen.}
<C>__{will}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{that's not exactly how i'd put it.}
<C>__{warfield's voice }
<D>__{no, no. i suppose not. but i look forward to reading the report. very sad. very sad. funny...}
<C>__{will}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{what do you mean, "funny?"}
<C>__{warfield's voice}
<D>__{oh, nothing. just that i felt detective eckhart and i, hap and i, were starting to make a real connection before you left. i sensed that he was ready to get some things off his chest. did you sense anything like that, detective? i mean, as his partner?...}
<A>__{will, squeezing the phone cord with his bloody fist.}
<C>__{warfield's voice }
<D>__{...you were his partner for, what, about ten years?...}
<A>__{will turns from rachel. eyes burning. voice steady.}
<C>__{will}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{you know why everyone hates you, warfield? it's not your questions, it's not your press conferences, it's not even your cheap suits; everyone hates you 'cause day after day you suck the marrow out of real cops when you never had the balls to become one yourself. well i got to tell you, it's a shame you're not up here with me because i'd love to show you right now just what a real cop is capable of. you just remember that when you're sitting at your bullshit desk reading your bullshit report on my dead partner!}
<A>__{slam! he hangs up the phone. runs his hand through his hair. turns back to rachel.}
<C>__{will }
<D>__{next time. go ahead and lie.}
