<A>__{various extra close ups of this luxurious patchwork of brilliant greens:}
<B>__{a polished brass sprinkler head}
<A>__{pops up from the ground and begins to water the already dew soaked lawn.}
<B>__{fleet of ducklings}
<A>__{no mother in sight, cruise through the thrushes. graveyard of golf balls, underwater at the bottom of a water hazard.}
<B>__{palm fronds}
<A>__{after a neat they sway, revealing the barren desert that surrounds the artificial oasis. the sun already bakes the air. we hear the opening guitar strains of the kim deal kurt cobain suet of "what i did for love," as we crane down the palms to a brand new titleist 3 ball. just on the edge of the rough. a pair of yellow trousers moves in. an iron confidently addresses the ball, and chips it out. the trousers walk out after it.}
<B>__{hands}
<A>__{digging dirt out of the grooves of the iron's face with a golf tee, while on the way to the green. both hands are gloved, instead of one, and the gloves are black.}
<B>__{yellow trousers}
<A>__{in a squat over the ball, sizing up the curvy, fifty foot journey to the hole. the figure positions himself and the putter above the ball, then pops the ball lightly. the ball rolls and bobs with purpose toward the hole, dodging hazards and finding lanes, until it finally falls off of the green and into the hole.}
<B>__{the gloved hand}
<A>__{sets the ball on the next tee. the figure moves to a leather golf bag. the hands pull the wipe rag off of the top of the bag and drop it on the ground, reach into the bag, drawing out a compact sniper rifle, affixed with a long silencer. the figure drops one knee down onto the rag, the other foot firmly setting its spikes. we move the figure to see the face of the sniper, concentrating down the scope in his half squat. he is martin blank. we swing around behind his head to look down the barrel with him. four hundred yards away, on another part of the course, another green is barely visible through groves of trees and rough. three miniscule, silver haired figures come into view. one of them, in a red sweater sets up for first putt. he could be an investment banker, or an arms trader. martin's arm flinches, and a low thunk reports from the rifle. a second later in the distance, the red sweater's head seems to vanish from his shoulders into a crimson mist. his body crumples to the green.}
<B>__{martin}
<A>__{returns the rifle to the bag, pulls out a driver, moves to the tee and whacks the ball. he watches its path and whispers absently...}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{hooked it.}
