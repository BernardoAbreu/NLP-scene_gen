<A>__{wolf (still wearing his eyepatch) walks over and sits quietly in a chair beside cora. he does not speak to her and gazes blankly out at nick, tito, and nicole on the set some distance away. cora however stares at the side of his head with such intensity wolf can't help but turn to her. cora still doesn't take her eyes off him and in fact stares even more intently into his eye. wolf glances away for a moment then looks back. cora continues to stare at him. suddenly, his eye is full of tears. cora watches in rapt silence. wolf is crying openly now. cora reveals no hint of emotion as she reaches out and gently lifts the eyepatch off of his eye. a tight smile of satisfaction creases her lips as a tiny pool of tears is released, streaming quickly down wolf's cheek. no one sees this.}
