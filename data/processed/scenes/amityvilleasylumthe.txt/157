<A>__{lisa knocks on the door to doctor's mixter's office.}
<C>__{mixter }
<D>__{come in.}
<A>__{lisa pops her head inside.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{doctor mixter.}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{oh lisa, hello. what brings you here?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i just wondered if i could speak to you for a moment sir. it's very important.}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{of course, come in.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{77.interior mixter's office continuous}
<A>__{lisa enters and sits down opposite mixter, who is sat behind his desk filling out a form.}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{what can i do for you lisa?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{well... what i'm going to tell you will sound really strange but i need to tell you.}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{okay, go ahead.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{do you know the history of the land the hospital is built on?}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{what are you referring to exactly?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{well, first of all. the defeo murders and the infamous house that people said was haunted.}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{i am aware of the defeo murders yes. the hauntings... well i think it's common perception now that a lot of that was exaggerated by the media.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{maybe. are you aware of the history of the land dating back to the eighteenth century?}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{no, i can't say that i am.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{there were a group of native americans in amityville known as "the satchem tribe". they were massacred by christians after a dispute over the land.}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{okay. i'm sure there's a point to all this?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{yes. sadie krenwinkel down on ward x. she shares the beliefs of the satchem tribe. i have reason to believe that somehow she has access to the internet and witchcraft paraphernalia and she's planning on a human sacrifice tonight to try and raise the god she believes in, the dark master, and become immortal.}
<A>__{mixter chuckles.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i'm serious.}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{have you been reading up on sadie? it's rather outlandish stuff isn't it? but i can assure you she has no access to the internet or anything else.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{go on the internet and check out the blog! she signs herself sister sadie.}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{well that could be anyone called sadie couldn't it?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{go down and search her cell!}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{i don't believe that will be necessary. the patients on ward x spend twenty three hours a day in the cell. they get an hour of exercise in a small yard guarded by six of our staff. there's no way that any of those patients have access to the internet or any paraphernalia.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{then someone is helping her get access to this stuff! someone who works here! please doctor mixter. just check out her cell and speak to her. if i'm wrong about this and it's all just her delusions then fine. i will accept that. but i had to tell you. you testified at her trial didn't you?}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{yes i did. what are you implying?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{nothing. i just meant you know how dangerous she is.}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{yes, i understand how dangerous she is and i appreciate you coming to express your concerns. one thing you need to bear in mind lisa is that there are some very sick patients at this institution. we do our best to help those who can be helped but unfortunately the patients on ward x are beyond help. their personality disorders are too advanced, their delusions are too grandiose. i worry that perhaps you have been rather taken in by one of those delusions.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i know that it might sound like that. but can you check her cell and speak to her? look at the blog on the internet, see if you can connect the ip number of the writer with a computer here at the hospital.}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{okay look. that does take time and resources i don't necessarily have. but as you've come to me with a concern of patient infraction and potential threat of violence, i am duty bound to investigate.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{in fact, i will order a cell search immediately. stay here for a moment, i will be right back.}
<A>__{mixter exits. lisa leans forward and a file on the desk catches her eye. she stands up and reaches over for it. her name is on it. lisa opens it up. inside is a form committing her to the hospital as a patient. lisa looks down and the reason stated is paranoid delusion. the date on the form is november 13th. today. lisa slams the file shut and the office door opens. she turns to see mixter stood there with hardcastle and another orderly.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing??}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{this is for your own good lisa. you need treatment.}
<A>__{the orderlies approach her. lisa lashes out but the two men overpower her, grabbing her arms and then tripping her. she hits the floor with a thud. mixter produces a syringe from behind his back.}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{this is for your own good lisa.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{fuck you!!!}
<A>__{mixter plunges the needle into her neck. pov shot: lisa looks up at mixter and the orderlies and we fade to black:}
