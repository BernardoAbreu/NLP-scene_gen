<L>__{exterior dan pienaar secondary school for boys day}
<A>__{dan pienaar school is a typical johannesburg afrikaan school. the students are mainly from middle class families. school athletics are in progress. the stu dents, in their smart school uniforms, are cheering enthusiastically a relay race on the immaculately kept sports ground. gordon ngubene, a 47 years old african laborer is work ing in the school garden. a few feet away is his 15 years old son jonathan leaning against a wall watching the games. ben du toit, a 50 year old afrikaaner history teacher, is enthusiastically cheering his son johan, a 15 years old, who is leading neck and neck with another boy in the last leg of the race. the excitement increases as they approach the tape. ben is beside himself, egging his son with shouts. the young teacher, viviers, standing next to ben, is shouting "come on johan," and slapping the father on the back. johan breasts the tape just ahead of the other boy. the ground is invaded by boys running to congratulate johan. ben hurries towards his happy but exhausted son; the proud father pushing his way through the animated boys. as he reaches johan he pats him on the back.}
