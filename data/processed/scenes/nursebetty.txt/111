<L>__{exterior beverly hilton evening}
<A>__{rosa and betty approach the hotel entrance. ahead of them a black lincoln town car pulls up. headlights glint on the chrome, hitting betty in the eye. she freezes, and rosa bumps into her.}
<C>__{rosa}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{betty stares at the car, unable to remember what it should mean. then a man in a tuxedo gets out. betty moves on.}
<L>__{interior beverly hilton lobby evening}
<A>__{a sign on an easel reads "save the children." betty and rosa present their tickets at the door to a ballroom. several times there is a stir near the entrance and a scattering of flashbulbs. rosa scans the crowd.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{looking for someone?}
<C>__{rosa}
<D>__{you never know who you'll see.}
<A>__{rosa keeps looking. finally, george mccord the actor who plays david ravell enters. he comes in with lyla branch, late 40's, and two other men. several women approach george, some starry eyed, for quick, polite greetings. he's doing his job of being a soap star. rosa waits for an opening, then puts her hands on betty's shoulders and points her at george.}
<C>__{rosa }
<D>__{look who's here!}
<A>__{betty's jaw drops. she freezes.}
<C>__{rosa }
<D>__{what are you waiting for? talk to him! you came fifteen hundred miles for this.}
<A>__{rosa prods her, then betty makes her way unsteadily toward george. when she's a few feet away he looks up. he can't help but notice her she's beautiful. she's also looking right into his eyes. the conversation stops as he does a double take in betty's direction.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{do i know you from...?}
<A>__{his friends watch as george studies her face.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{...of course you do.}
<P>__{(hurt)}
<D>__{you don't remember me?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i take it i should. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{we were engaged.}
<C>__{lyla}
<D>__{oh good, another one...}
<A>__{george's friends look at each other. a few heads turn.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i beg your pardon?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{but i'm the one who's sorry. letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life.}
<P>__{(to his friends)}
<D>__{we were thirteen days away from getting married and ... i just got scared. it's a mistake i've had to live with for six years. but it's behind me now...}
<P>__{(to george)}
<D>__{and i hope you can put it behind you. i've missed you... david.}
<A>__{george sighs with relief. his friends smile. the tension evaporates. they can handle a fanatical fan.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{that's very kind of you.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{the day i left you i just drove and drove. i drove all day and all that night, and i didn't go anywhere. i just kept driving. i stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in, and i sat }
<C>__{lyla}
<D>__{... in the very first pew, where we would have sat on our wedding day.}
<A>__{betty looks at her. so does george.}
<C>__{lyla }
<D>__{i can't believe i remembered that, although i suppose i should. i wrote it...}
<P>__{(to betty)}
<D>__{but that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. i'm flattered... i think. or frightened. what's your name?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{betty sizemore. what do you mean you wrote it?}
<C>__{lyla}
<D>__{i'm lyla branch. i'm the producer.}
<A>__{they shake hands. across the room rosa watches expectantly.}
<C>__{lyla }
<D>__{alright, i admit it, you had me there. you're better than most of them, anyway...do you have a headshot?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{no, wait...what happened next, betty?}
<C>__{lyla}
<D>__{are you sure you want to encourage this?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{no, you're right, let's have some fun. so, what did happened next, "betty"?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{well, david moved out here and started his residency. then he met leslie }
<C>__{lyla}
<D>__{no, no, no. we know all that. what happened with you?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i married a car salesman.}
<A>__{the friends laugh. rosa watches, confused. so is betty.}
<D>__{friend #1 you were dumped for a car salesman, george!}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{why are you calling him george? friend #2 yeah david tell us about this car salesman.}
<A>__{george likes the challenge. this party isn't so boring after all.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{oh, you mean fred.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{no, del.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{right, del. del was one hot salesman. of cars. he could talk anyone into anything.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{you knew del?!}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{honey, i didn't want to tell you at the time, but del and i go way back. we went to school together. in fact, he saved my life. two more minutes in that icy water and i would have drowned. but del jumped in and grabbed me. we fell out of touch eventually, but i still owe him one.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{he never told me anything about...that's unbelievable!}
<C>__{lyla}
<D>__{funny, that's just what i was thinking...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.}
<A>__{his friends snicker. rosa stares. betty is oblivious to everything but george.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i'm so sorry. life makes us do awful things sometimes.}
<A>__{she's ready to cry. which only inspires him all the more.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. but... del?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{there was no plan! i was just young and stupid and scared!}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you never gave us a chance...}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i know that. i can't tell you how many times i've said that to myself in those exact words.}
<A>__{betty wipes her tears away as they flow freely now. george doesn't like seeing her cry; he tries to say something but his friends interrupt.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{hey, don't... come on, i was just... you're not really crying, are you?... i was just playing along... friend #1 now, look what you've done, george.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{why do they keep calling you george?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i don't know. why do you keep calling me george?}
<C>__{lyla}
<D>__{listen david it's getting late.}
<A>__{george hesitates; lyla sees it.}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(to betty)}
<D>__{right, uhh...i feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another party.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but... i'd be honored if you'd come.}
<C>__{lyla}
<D>__{yeah, bring your friend along. i'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do...}
<A>__{rosa watches, stunned, as betty waves to her as she leaves arm in arm with the man of her dreams.}
