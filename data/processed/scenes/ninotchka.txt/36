<C>__{leon}
<D>__{hyah!}
<A>__{another truckman responds with equal exuberance. long shot restaurant leon, intoxicated with his success, waves to the whole room.}

<A>__{he gets a wonderful response from all. they realize that a swell drunk is among them.}

<C>__{pere mathieu}
<D>__{i'm always glad to meet a new customer, and i hope this first visit will not be your last.}
<A>__{he exits out of shot. ninotchka, her suspicion confirmed, looks at leon.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{just an old man. his memory is getting weak.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{what are you after?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{must one always be after something?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{your tactics are useless. my name is neither buljanoff, iranoff, nor kopalski.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{oh, ninotchka, who wants to talk business. if you win the suit, fine. if we win the suit, better. you do me an injustice.}

<D>__{when we went to my apartment did i have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{but you have now, and i know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in russia would be punished by death.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{death! death! always so glum! what about life, ninotchka! do russians never think of life? of the moment in which we are living? the only moment we really have? don't take it all so seriously, ninotchka. nothing is worth it. please... relax... i beg you, sergeant... smile!}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(astonished)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{will you smile?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{just smile.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{at what?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{at anything. at the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. at people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. if you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{because we are an odd couple.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{then you should go back to your table.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{no, i can't leave you. i won't. not yet. not until i've made you laugh... at least once.}
<A>__{to get rid of him ninotchka emits a joyless sound which approximates a laugh.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{ha! ha! now go back.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{that's not a laugh! i mean a laugh from the heart. now let's see. i'm going to tell you a funny story. just a moment... i've got it! well, it seems there were a couple of frenchmen who went to america...}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{on which boat?}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(thrown off by her methodical thinking)}
<D>__{well, er... let's drop it. i don't think you would care for that one.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{probably not.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{do you like scotch stories?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{i have never heard one.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{two scotchmen met on the street... and i don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. well, anyway, one's name was mcintosh and the other's was mcgillicuddy. mcintosh says to mcgillicuddy, "hello, mr. mcgillicuddy," and mcgillicuddy says to mcintosh, "hello, mr. mcintosh," and then mcintosh says to mcgillicuddy, "how is mrs. mcgillicuddy?" and then mcgillicuddy says to mcintosh, "how is mrs. mcintosh?"...}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{i wish they had never met.}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(disarmed)}
<D>__{so do i.}
<P>__{(after a little pause)}
<D>__{now, here's a great one... ha! ha! ha!}
<P>__{(he looks at ninotchka}
<D>__{and her expression}
<P>__{stops him)}
<D>__{well, maybe it's not so good. let's forget it! how's this? two men are looking at the moon. one says to the other, "is it true that a lot of people live on the moon?" "yes, it is," says the other, "five hundred million." "whew!" replies the first, "they must get pretty crowded when it's half moon!" ha! ha! ha!}
<A>__{there is no response from ninotchka.}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(starting to get sore)}
<D>__{i suppose you don't think that's funny?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{it seemed funny to me when i first heard it. maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. maybe it's with you!}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{maybe you haven't any sense of humor. well, i will give you one more chance! now listen!}
<A>__{he gets up and speaks in a threatening voice audible to the entire room.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{when i heard this joke for the first time i laughed myself sick. here goes! a man comes into a restaurant and sits down and says, "waiter! get me a cup of coffee without cream." after five minutes the waiter comes back and says, "i'm sorry, sir, we're all out of cream, can it be without milk?"}
<B>__{group of several workmen}
<A>__{they have overheard the story and all burst into laughter.}
<B>__{ninotchka and leon}
<A>__{ninotchka continues to eat her soup without a shadow of a laugh.}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(furious)}
<D>__{not funny, huh?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{so you don't think that's funny? it is funny! everyone else thinks so! maybe you didn't get it.}
<A>__{he sits down again.}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(threateningly)}
<D>__{i will tell you that joke again. a man comes into a restaurant. did you get that?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{he sits down at the table and says to the waiter... did you get that too?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{well, so far it isn't funny, but wait. he says to the waiter, "waiter! bring me a cup of coffee." so the waiter comes back five minutes later and says, "i'm sorry, sir, we have no coffee."...}
<P>__{(he realizes he has made a mistake)}
<D>__{wait a minute... wait a minute... i'm all mixed up...}
<P>__{(he starts over again)}
<D>__{a man comes in a restaurant, he sits down, he calls the waiter and he says, "waiter! get me a cup of coffee without cream," and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says, "i'm sorry, sir, we have no cream, can it be a glass of milk!"}
<A>__{he gets up and goes over to his table furiously.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{ah! you have no sense of humor! that settles it! you have no sense of humor! none! no humor!!}
<A>__{in his excitement he leans on the shaky table. it topples forward. simultaneously his feet shoot from under him and he sits violently on the floor, the contents of the table crashing about him, hot soup in his face. a terrific roar of laughter arises; the whole restaurant is rocking with laughter. for a split second ninotchka makes an effort to control the irresistible impulse to laugh but loses the battle and herself roars with laughter.}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(indignantly)}
<D>__{what's funny about this?}
<A>__{ninotchka's laughter is uncontrollable. after a moment leon gets up and sits next to her. as he dries himself with his napkin he sees the humor of the situation and starts to howl with laughter too. the ice is broken at last! on their mutual wild hilarity, we}
