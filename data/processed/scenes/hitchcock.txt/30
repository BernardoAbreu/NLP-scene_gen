<A>__{pudgy fingers part the slats of the blind. hitch stares out hoping for some human moment to spy on. he's restless... peggy ushers joseph stefano, 30s, into hitch's office.}
<C>__{joseph stefano}
<D>__{joe stefano. good to meet you.}
<A>__{hitchcock leaves stefano's hand dangling in mid air and sits down at his desk.}

<D>__{sorry i was late. my shrink session ran overtime. i see him every day and it's still not enough.}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{i thought only director's assistants needed psychiatrists, not writers.}
<A>__{stefano laughs off the barb and takes a seat as peggy slips out. the two men stare at each other but stefano's not remotely intimidated.}
<C>__{joseph stefano}
<D>__{do you see a shrink, mr. hitchcock?}
<A>__{hitch's eyes follow a plume of cigar smoke curling up to the ceiling...}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{his gaze remains pointedly fixed on the ceiling.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock }
<D>__{i must say it boggles the mind to imagine what you and your "shrink" could possibly talk about daily.}
<C>__{joseph stefano}
<D>__{the usual: sex. rage. my mother.}
<A>__{hitchcock lowers his gaze, suddenly intrigued.}
