<A>__{as christy and mary robert climb the fire escape, another gunshot echoes in the alley, ricocheting off the fire escape. the nuns climb higher up the building. mike pursues, looking for a shot between the steps and the landings, but not finding any openings. he takes the steps two at a time and begins to gain ground. at the fourth floor landing, christy's heel gets stuck in the grating. she pulls frantically at the laces.}

<A>__{mike arrives at the landing just as christy twists her toot out of the shoe, and surprises him with a lunge for the gun. mike's hand is knocked back against the metal frame of the fire escape, and the gun flies loose, rattling down the metal steps to the landing below. christy shoves mary robert into the open window of an apartment, and follows her in.}
