<L>__{interior motel room later that night}
<A>__{local news on the tv: willy pushing past media outside the courthouse; official photo of nunally; footage from the standoff at crawford's. the sound is low, and nunally isn't watching. he's sitting on the edge of the bed...looking down at his gun, in his hands. a knock on the door "wakes" him. beat. he sets the gun aside, goes to peek out the curtains. lets willy in.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{you're not easy to find. i had to call internal affairs.}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{yeah they put me on a desk 'til this gets...sorted out.}
<A>__{he uncomfortably watches willy glance around at the half empty liquor bottle, the mismatched suitcases and paper bags full of balled up clothes. and the gun on the bed.}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{got home my wife already took the kids to her folks. press is all over our front lawn. friggin' vampires.}
<A>__{he falters, haunted by the echo. willy doesn't notice:}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{what the hell were you thinking. you're on the job and you get called to your girlfriend's house }
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{i didn't know it was her house. i'd never been there.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{it was her name!}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{i didn't know her name!}
<A>__{willy waits. nunally explains, reluctant to expose himself:}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{no last names. her rules. we met at the same hotel room, twice a week no phone calls, no questions. she didn't want us to know too much about each other. she said it was like...travel in a foreign country. no baggage from our lives. just us. escaping.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{did you get the feeling she had rules because she had done it before? with other guys?}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{no. i don't know. maybe.}
<P>__{(thinking, remembering:)}
<D>__{no. it was all just this...crazy thing. for both of us. it was... real. you know? we didn't expect that, when we started. we didn't know where it was going. i had cheated so many times, i was numb but she was ...new. and she made me feel like there was some chance. to change. we were scared. it was like we were afraid to go forward, but we couldn't go back.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you always think you have time. to work it out. or make things right.}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{what was i supposed to do?!}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{you were supposed to tell me!}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{i'm married! i have kids!}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{you thought nobody knew so maybe you could just walk away clean.}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{no! i didn't think he knew! okay?! even after. i thought it was just massively fouled up...bad luck. like god telling me something.}
<P>__{(anguished)}
<D>__{i'm there. my mind is going crazy. i know the confession won't hold if anyone finds out.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i thought the guy was a whack!}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{yeah? well, he's not.}
<A>__{nunally won't look at willy. he just sits there, numb.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{is there anything else you can give me. anything that might get us some evidence.}
<A>__{nunally shakes his head. willy grimaces. goes to the door.}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{i...tried to warn you.}
<A>__{willy stops. looks back.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{you warned me he was smart. you didn't warn me you were stupid.}
<A>__{nunally winces. takes it. willy feels a little badly. two guys in a shabby motel room, in terrible trouble.}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{how do we get the confession back in?}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{we don't.}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{what are you gonna do?}
<A>__{willy shakes his head. walks out.}
