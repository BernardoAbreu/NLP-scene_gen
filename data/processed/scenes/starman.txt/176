<L>__{interior porsche day}
<A>__{the speedometer reads 90. the driver, a bespectacled, pimply faced sixteen year old, shifts into fifth gear. jenny is harnessed in the passenger seat. chatter from a cb under the dash competes with rock n' roll on the tape deck.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you sure this is your car?}
<C>__{teenager}
<P>__{(with a stutter)}
<D>__{my grandmother's rich.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(as they come up on a station wagon)}
<D>__{slow down, slow down.}
<C>__{teenager}
<D>__{geez, mrs. haydn, we just got going.}
<A>__{but he downshifts. the porsche is going a mere 80 when they pass the station wagon.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(peering at its occupants)}
<D>__{i told you i'm looking for someone.}
<C>__{teenager}
<D>__{in the cars, too?!}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i don't know where he is.}
<C>__{teenager}
<D>__{this is going to be a real drag. i thought you wanted to go fast.}
<A>__{howling at full throttle, three highway patrol cars rush past them in the opposite direction. jenny swivels around to follow their progress until they are out of sight.}
<C>__{teenager}
<D>__{they after you?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{what? no, of course not.}
<C>__{teenager}
<P>__{(his stutter thicker than before)}
<D>__{would be kinda neat if they were. i think i could outrun them. maybe get my picture in the papers.}
<A>__{jenny takes a second look at this guy. he flashes her a gap toothed grin.}
