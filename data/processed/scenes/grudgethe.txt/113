<A>__{karen paces down the hall towards a reception area. doug catches up with her, turning her towards him.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{look, i'm sorry. i was just worried about you, and i know you, karen.}
<A>__{karen turns to him. a sober look on her face.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{the same thing happened three years ago, doug. to a japanese family, who lived in that house. they were all found dead.}
<A>__{doug studies her for a moment.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{so you think the events are connected?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{how would you explain it?}
<A>__{she watches doug as he thinks. carefully.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{okay. how about this: the american family knew about what had happened there before, and this knowledge subconsciously caused them to repeat the same events.}
<A>__{karen gives doug a skeptical look.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{it's exactly how superstitions survive: if you walk under a ladder and think uh oh, you're in for some bad luck, sure enough, what do you know? you trip over }
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(heard it before:)}
<D>__{ trip over the curb and sprain your ankle.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{makes sense, right?}
<A>__{karen stops walking. considering something.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{okay. then explain this: when i went to that house, i didn't know anything about its past. but yet i still saw...}
<A>__{she hesitates, realizing she's said too much.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{saw what? karen?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{emma and i were alone in that room, but there was something else there. i'm sure of it.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{you watched a woman die, kat. that's a horrible thing to experience. i can't imagine how you must feel. but sometimes the mind tries to cope with terrible things in a way that distorts what actually occurred.}
<A>__{karen's eyes never leave his. softly, but firmly:}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you might be right, doug. but i know what i saw.}
<P>__{(then, faltering:)}
<D>__{i think i know what i saw...}
<A>__{after a moment, doug pulls her into a hug.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{you just need to rest. we'll get you home, get a good night's sleep.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{but her eyes speak differently. she covers it well, stepping back and glancing over at the reception desk:}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you've got class, and i'm sure i only have to fill out a few forms or something }
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{you sure?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i'm fine, doug. really.}
<A>__{he kisses her, then exits. he pauses at the front doors to give her a little wave. she smiles... but the smile droops as soon as he's out of sight. after a moment, she turns and walks to the front desk.}
