<C>__{abby}
<D>__{would you like to dance?}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i don't know if i can, i think i'm still on duty.}

<C>__{abby}
<D>__{so as far as you know, you have good semen?}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{is that a trick question?}

<D>__{this is my husband. michael.}
<A>__{michael smiles, shakes hands with a grave digger's grip. the postman doesn't know what to think.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{we've been trying to have a baby for three years. we can't on account of michael had the bad mumps when he was twelve. so we need a body father. we could ask a man here, but it could cause trouble. i've seen it happen. things go okay until the woman starts to show. then it can be bad. but you'll only be around once in awhile with the mail.}
<A>__{the postman just stares at them. abby looks to michael.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{he hasn't said 'no'.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(undaunted)}
<D>__{what do you say, mister? you'd be doing us a favor.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i will have to think about it.}
<A>__{the postman excuses himself with a nod and turns away, shaking his head at the strangeness of this new world. but no rest for the wicked, as soon as he's free from abby and michael, he's running smack into another group of well wishing townies. mrs. march is among them. she's holding an envelope.}
<D>__{townie #1 mrs. march wants to give you something.}
<P>__{(to mrs. march)}
<D>__{he's right here, irene.}

<D>__{it's to my daughter annie. she left five years ago. she was only fifteen. the last i heard, she was living up north...}
<A>__{the postman swallows hard, looks from the envelope to the faces around him, to mrs. march. she looks blindly back. how can he lie to her?}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{look, mrs. march, you should know that...}
<C>__{mrs. march}
<D>__{know what?}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{know that...}
<A>__{but she stops him, grabs for his hand.}
<C>__{mrs. march}
<D>__{i have a feeling about you. i know you'll do what's right.}
<A>__{her hand leaves his and she disappears into the crowd. she's left him with her letter and no choice at all.}
<C>__{the postman}
