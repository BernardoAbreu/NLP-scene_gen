<C>__{ted}
<D>__{yeah. very cute. you know what i'd like to do to her? somethin' i call a dirty fozzie.}
<A>__{ted waves to the girl. she waves back. he makes a kissy face at her. she giggles and blows him a kiss back. he pantomimes hard, thrusting, standing up sex. her eyes widen for a beat, as she stares, then smiles. he grabs an oh henry bar, and pantomimes fellatio. the girl laughs hysterically. close angle on ted, as white liquid sprays all over his face from one side, then from the other. widen to reveal he's squirting two bottles of pump hand soap on either side of him. the girl laughs and shakes her head "no."}
