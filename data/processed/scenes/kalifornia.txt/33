<L>__{exterior early's trailer late that night}
<A>__{adele steps out of the trailer.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{early?}
<A>__{she walks carefully around the junk piles. it's dark; hard to see. she comes to the edge of a deep dark hole and peers in... she can't see anything but hears the rustling of a shovel digging.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{early? you down there?}
<A>__{the sound of digging stops.}
<C>__{early}
<P>__{(from inside the hole)}
<D>__{what's up adele? dinner ready?}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{almost.}
<A>__{after a moment's hesitation, early resumes his digging.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{early...}
<A>__{the digging stops again.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{tell me more about california.}
<A>__{the moonlight illuminates his face when he looks up at her.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{well... for one thing... they think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{i guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{yeah, and in california you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... and i heard your first month's rent is free; state law. i figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{what'll we do out there?}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{well... the very first thing we're gonna do... is get us a couple of six packs of lucky lager and climb up on toppa' that famous hollywood sign and howl at the moon...}
<A>__{early lets out a playful howl, as adele looks up over her shoulder at the moon.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{you know... i read once... ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{bull. that ain't right... government sends people there all the time, just don't want us to know about it.}
<A>__{adele smiles and begins walking back to the trailer.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{i heard that.}
<A>__{after a moment, early climbs out of the hole and stands in the moonlight for a moment. we see that he's completely naked except for a pair of high top steel toed work boots. early gazes up into the night sky, looking at the cold white moon.}
