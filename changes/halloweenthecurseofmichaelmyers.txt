A wooden symbol of Thorn, like an inverted crucifix, hangs in a place of reverence. Behind the altar, the Shape stands in its cell.  Waiting. Loomis is led inside.  Wynn glides through this macabre gathering, up to the altar.  Looming over the terrified Kara. The CHANTING continues as Wynn dons a magnificent ceremonial robe.  At Wynn's gesture, there is SILENCE.  The worshippers offer an obedient response, removing their hoods, baring the mark of Thorn on their wrists. We recognize many of the faces in the congregation.  Wynn's staff.  Dr. Bonham.  Mrs. Blankenship.  The cross-eyed attendant from the bus depot. People from all walks of life. Faces glazed with sadistic rapture.}

The Shape lurches empathetically.  Wynn staggers, yanks the blade from his stomach. RAPID-FIRE GUNSHOTS rip through the chamber as Tommy lets loose a barrage of bullets from above.  Taking out several coven members, the rest scattering, retreating into the tunnels. Loomis dives Danny a split second before he through Kara's bonds with the dagger. Kara springs toward the baby as the room is ripped apart by GUNFIRE.  The altar decimated.  Candles falling.  Setting the room ablaze. Wynn releases the supports which suspend the catwalk.  Wooden girders CRASH down from the ceiling.  Tommy pitches to the floor, dropping the rifle. The Shape staggers, trying to get to its feet.  Slowly.  Painfully.  Flames lapping at its back. Loomis crawls toward the rifle.  Grabs it.  Rises just as Wynn seizes Danny, a dagger at his throat.  Pulling him away.}
