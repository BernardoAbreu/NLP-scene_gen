<A>__{angle on: the black boots of a man, walk down a hallway, as students peer from their sleeping quarters, terrified.}
<L>__{interior gymnasium night}

<C>__{jean}
<D>__{rogue, where have you been?}
<C>__{rogue}
<D>__{logan. the professor wants you to come with me right away.}
<A>__{e.c.u. on logan's nose. his nostrils flare... sensing... logan squints the tiniest bit. we know he knows something is wrong, but he is hiding it.}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(to rogue)}
<D>__{hey rogue, tell jean what you were telling me last night.}
<A>__{rogue pauses. confused.}
<C>__{rogue}
<D>__{the professor }
<A>__{logan walks towards her.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{you remember. about women.}
<A>__{he moves closer.}
<C>__{rogue}
<D>__{logan }
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{whatever you say about them being the same...}
<A>__{shook. the claws are out. he lunges.}
<C>__{logan }
<D>__{no two women smell alike.}
<A>__{he grabs rogue by the throat.}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{logan, what are you doing?}
<A>__{jean, seeing logan threaten rogue with his claws for the second time, raises a vaulting horse into the air.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{this ainit rogue!}
<A>__{he keeps his claws pointed at her face. angle tight: logan's left hand is wrapped around rogue's throat but part of it is touching the exposed skin of her}
<B>__{face with no ill effects.}
<A>__{jean realizes that logan is right. rogue morphs into}
<B>__{mystique.}
<C>__{magneto }
<D>__{telekinesis.}
<A>__{jean spins around and sees magneto. without hesitation, the vaulting horse flies at magneto. simultaneously, one of the thousand pound weights flies from the weight set and smashes the vaulting horse aside.}
<C>__{magneto }
<D>__{fascinating. what i wouldnit give for that. alas, metal is all iim good for. but it seems to serve me well enough.}
<A>__{jean is completely unaware of the huge set of lockers rising behind her.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{jean!}
<B>__{wham.}
<A>__{the lockers hit her in the back, sending her flying. jean lies motionless on the floor, unconscious. the heavy lockers are floating above her, wavering between a few feet and a few inches.}
<C>__{magneto}
<D>__{i do love a good check mate.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{magneto}
<D>__{come with me and iill let her live.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{you think i care about her? iim the only one whois sure to walk out of here.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{magneto}
<D>__{then why donit you kill her.}
<A>__{this catches logan a little off guard.}
<C>__{magneto }
<D>__{go on. kill her. you can do it quicker than i will. maybe iill just cripple her.}
<A>__{the lockers now stand upright, hovering over jean's knees.}
<C>__{magneto }
<D>__{so do her the favor. show her mercy.}
<A>__{logan thinks for a moment looks at jean still unconscious on the floor. then: logan retracts his claws. mystique has morphed back into her natural state with the exception of one of rogue's pockets, which still clings to her hip. mystique produces a large syringe from the pocket and sticks it in logan's neck. logan's legs weaken instantly.}
<C>__{magneto }
<P>__{(to mystique)}
<D>__{call the others and tell them we have what we came for.}
