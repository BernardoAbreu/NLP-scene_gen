<L>__{exterior sand dunes day}
<A>__{a wasteland on the outskirts of town. the sandy waves are "surfed" by the noisy motorcycles. the jumping spiders keep after them, leaping a dozen feet in a single bound. a biker is ripped off a motorcycle. the bike crashes. larry ends up with a jumper on his bike. another biker tries to kick it off, managing to knock the critter into the motorcycle's spokes. the spider gets munched. but then the courageous biker crashes and is set upon by a hungry jumper. larry continues riding. but a spider lands on his back and sinks fangs into his spine. larry yells bloody murder. bret sees larry go down in a cloud of gore and sand. bret is the only human left. a jumper comes after him in mid air. bret does an x games style rocket air, kicking backward with booted legs. he knocks the spider away and keeps on riding.}
