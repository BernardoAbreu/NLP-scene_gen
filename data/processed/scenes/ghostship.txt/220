<L>__{interior chimera room 400 continuous day}
<A>__{epps steps in as the sound continues. she crosses the sitting room, coming to the doorway of the bedroom to find several mutineers, some in stewards attire, others wearing ships officers caps, obviously taken from their rightful owners. the repetitive sound comes from here, bed springs. and, from between the men, a woman's bare legs hang over the end of the bed as a pair of man's legs in boots lie between them, the bed rocking, the others looking on. epps turns to see the father. he is on his knees, hands tied behind his back as he is forced to watch from the foot of the bed.}
<B>__{epps looks down to see}
<A>__{epps' pov a geometric pattern of a lotus on the persian carpet at her feet. when she looks up again she sees what the father sees. the mutineer finishes, climbing off the woman. another of the men pulls her up to reveal that she is no woman at all, but katie. the mother and sister lie in a bloody heap near by as one of the other mutineers steps up to epps.}
<C>__{mutineer}
<D>__{you like that, daddy? i will show you something else now.}
<A>__{the mutineer steps back to the bed. he sits katie down so that she faces us on the end of the bed. he raises an axe over her, bringing it down as the world becomes a whirling blur }
<C>__{epps }
<D>__{no!!!!}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{the camera stops on katie standing on the other side of the room, now empty of people, returned to its shabby, abandoned state.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{it isn't real.}
<A>__{epps looks back at her from the other side of the room where she stands.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{many bad things have happened here. but you mustn't allow the evil inside. i tell you this because you can see me. the others can't. but you must leave. you must leave.}
<A>__{a loud gunshot sounds somewhere in the ship. when epps turns back katie is gone.}
