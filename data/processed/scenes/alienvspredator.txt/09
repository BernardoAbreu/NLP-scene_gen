<L>__{exterior teotihuacan, mexico day}
<A>__{thirty miles northeast of mexico city. 107 degrees in the shade. a group of workers runs through an archaeological site. behind them, in the near distance, looms the timeless beauty of the teotihuacan pyramids.}
<C>__{workers}
<P>__{(in spanish)}
<D>__{he's found it! he's found it!}
<A>__{workers begin running toward }
<L>__{exterior excavation site day}
<A>__{sebastian de rosa, the boy who turned his childhood love of exploring the woods behind his house into a lifelong obsession with archaeology, wipes sweat from his brow as he studies a computer printout that shows something buried just beneath the surface. thomas, sebastian's right hand, turns on a small digital video camera.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{it's too small to be the chamber.}
<A>__{thomas starts to record the discovery.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{it's a burial offering.}
<A>__{archeologists and workers speaking overlapping spanish, english and french gather around the excavation site, forming a large crowd. sebastian takes note of the crowd's excitement, it's almost as great as his own.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<P>__{(to the crowd)}
<D>__{the teotihuacans would bury a hundred or so gifts around the burial chamber. obsidian blades, pyrite mirrors, shells. we must be right on top of it.}
<A>__{the tension is unbearable as sebastian slowly begins to reach into the darkness of the trench, his arm slowly disappearing into the void. then going further. slowly, sebastian begins to lift something from the hole. we see the reaction on sebastian's face, but not the artifact. thomas is recording everything.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{professor?}
<A>__{sebastian turns slowly to show the crowd what he has uncovered. it's a faded red and blue metal object. a bent cap from a pepsi bottle. the disappointment in the crowd is palpable. sebastian is crushed.}
<C>__{juan ramirez }
<D>__{nineteen fifties i'd say.}
<A>__{sebastian looks over to see juan ramirez, an official with the department of interior.}
<C>__{juan ramirez }
<D>__{according to you, the teotihuacans' final gift to their dead king was a... pepsi.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{give me one more month.}
<C>__{juan ramirez}
<D>__{can't do it, sebastian. department of interior needed results six months ago. we're bringing in another team.}
