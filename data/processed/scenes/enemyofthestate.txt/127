<L>__{interior warehouse continuous}
<A>__{jones and three men are huddled in a duct.}
<C>__{voice }
<P>__{(through radio)}
<D>__{they're heading to the car.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{move it.}
<A>__{jones and the three men start down the corridor, guns drawn.}
<L>__{interior the second warehouse continuous}
<A>__{dean and brill are kneeling beside the chevy, letting the air out of the tires.}
<C>__{brill}
<D>__{empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. and turn your head. there might be some debris flying your way.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{why?}
<A>__{and with that, the first warehouse explodes, sending a fireball of debris in all directions.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{what the fuck?!}
<C>__{brill}
<D>__{they shouldn't have come without calling first.}
<A>__{brill jumps into the chevy, turns the key and the engine ignites. dean leaps in. brill stomps on the gas and tires screech. the chevy hurtles through the warehouse toward a shut garage door. brill clicks a remote. the door rises. outside the warehouse the chevy roars outward, screams around a corner, then speeds down a road lined with warehouses. dean looks down an intersecting road to glimpse a saturn sedan gaining on a parallel road.}
<C>__{brill}
<D>__{where's your gun?}
<A>__{they pass an area with no warehouses. the saturn turns, heading straight at them.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{back at the warehouse.}
<A>__{the saturn pulls on the road behind them. the man in the saturn leans out and fires an assault rifle. the side window by dean's head shatters. brill one hands the pistol and checks the load.}
<C>__{dean}
<P>__{(re: the pistol)}
<D>__{gimme that.}
<C>__{brill}
<D>__{you sure?}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{you're driving.}
<C>__{brill}
<D>__{those are feds.}
<C>__{dean}
<P>__{(taking the pistol)}
<D>__{i didn't see a warrant. did you see a warrant?}
<A>__{the chevy enters a narrow lane, the saturn right behind. with the chevy's tires flat and flapping, the saturn hugs their rear. dean looks back again as the rifleman fires the rear window explodes. dean pops up and fires three quick, well placed rounds. the saturn swerves and drops back. brill's impressed. dean looks forward to see an exit road blocked by an iron cross bar. brill, unfazed, pushes the chevy faster. beam or no beam, he's going through.}
<C>__{brill}
<D>__{think we let out enough air?}
<C>__{dean}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{oh my god...}
<A>__{brill and dean hit the deck as the chevy's hood scrapes just under the beam. the windshield frame takes the full impact. the beam slices through steel and glass, decapitating the car. they emerge on the other side minus roof and windows as the saturn screech stops inches from the beam and debris. a man leaps out, shoulders his rifle and aims but the chevy disappears around a building.}
