<A>__{a female voice appears out of the blackness and begins to sing solo, "went down to the river jordan." a response of "oh yeah" quickly follows. again the singer continues, "where john baptized three." the same faces we have seen on epps' plantation, but now filled with rapture, appear. it's as if the voices have created a new form of awakening and presence. it seems to transcend and translate in a strange way, joy. a joy which has un yet been seen on screen. a joy which has been hidden, but a joy which is undoubtedly there. it's captivating, infectious. this should be a moving part of the film, which stirs the audience and, for a moment, relieves them of the seemingly chastising environment. the singer continues, "well some say john was a baptist, some say john was a jew, but i say john was a preacher, because the bible says so too, preach on johnny." and with that, the rest of the congregation chant "i believe. oh, i believe."}
