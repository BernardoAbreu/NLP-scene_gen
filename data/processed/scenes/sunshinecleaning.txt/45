<L>__{interior bar day}
<A>__{joe enters a dingy little corner bar where everyone's a regular. a couple of old guys slump over the bar. the bartender smiles.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{hey joe, what you got for me?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{world's finest corn snack.}
<A>__{joe hands the canister to the bartender and sits down on a stool. the bartender pours him a beer.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{see where old miller's house sold?}
<A>__{joe nods. a grizzled regular nearby looks over at joe.}
<C>__{regular}
<D>__{bet you could get a chunk of change for your place. you should cash out now before the market turns sour.}
<A>__{joe shakes his head.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i'm not selling my house. no way. i don't care how much those idiots would shell out for it. i got history in that house. you think they understand about history?}
<C>__{regular}
<D>__{still... how much commission you get on that popcorn? bet you gotta sell a lot of corn to }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{hey, the corn's good. really good. not like the pet food but that was a phenomenon.}
<A>__{the bartender sets a basket of cheddar popcorn in the space between joe and the grizzled regular.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{it'll get there. takes time to get to know the market. develop a relationship with the buyers. but it'll get there. who doesn't like popcorn for christ's sake.}
<C>__{regular}
<D>__{my brother in law's in sales.}
<A>__{the regular scoops up a handful of powdery orange popcorn.}
<C>__{regular}
<D>__{last year he buys a cow.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{why would you buy a cow?}
<C>__{regular}
<D>__{not a live cow. a whole butchered cow from a rancher. on the hoof they call it.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{mm hmm.}
<A>__{joe looks at him with renewed interest.}
<C>__{regular}
<D>__{he sells off the parts of this cow to a bunch of restaurants. direct. made a killing.}
<A>__{the grizzled man licks orange powder from his fingers.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what'd he do with the brains and intestines?}
<A>__{regular shrugs. joe's wheels are turning.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{so he cuts out the middle man. not a bad idea.}
<A>__{joe takes a drink of his beer while he mulls it over.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{course it'd be smarter to do that with something that didn't have bad parts. like... shrimp.}
