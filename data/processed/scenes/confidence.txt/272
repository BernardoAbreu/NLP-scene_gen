<A>__{jake goes flying into the bar. lupus pushed jake back up against the bar and lands a series of body blows. jake manages to grab the phone and whips it across lupus' head, sending him to the ground. jake straddles lupus and raises the phone for the last whack. we hear a loud click. jake stops and the two slowly get up. as they stand, we can see that lupus has the barrel of a small gun in jake's mouth. jake shuts his eyes tight, still holding the phone. which just then, rings. jake opens his eyes and looks at the phone. then to lupus, who nods. jake picks up the receiver and speaks, the gun still in his mouth.}
