<L>__{interior wesley & jacob's bedroom day}
<A>__{jacob closes the door. all the kids are here. gina absentmindedly plays with some of wesley's things.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{when i was put under, freddy was released. i know this because i dreamed it.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{and that dream was real?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{yes. wesley was his first victim.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{aw, man...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you said it yourself. how could it have been a cigarette?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{and how could he...dire that way and not wake up?}
<C>__{gina}
<P>__{(mockingly)}
<D>__{maybe the "authorities" will figure it out.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i just can't buy into this.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{call me crazy...but i think he's after rosedale. the whole place. in my dream he said something about needing a few souls to get the job done. i think he has to kill in order to get the power to suck in a new town.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{you are crazy.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{thank you. there's more. there are... other people in there. in the nightmares.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{like him?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no. different. there are three of them. they're dressed in black. they have powers like freddy, but they seem to be on our side.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{who are they?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{well, you gotta hang in there with me on this one. they call themselves... the dream police.}
<A>__{scott actually laughs.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{this is too much.}
<C>__{gina}
<D>__{you mean...like cops?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i guess.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{where are they from?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{they're kids that freddy killed years ago. they don't even know how they got there. but they're somehow patrolling dreamworld to put a stop to krueger.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{then why haven't these guys done the job already?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{they say they need help. i don't know what or why...yet.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{i can tell you who needs help.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{hey, i'm trying to save all of us.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{i won't believe it until i see it.}
<A>__{jacob is crushed that he's not getting through to them.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{by then it'll be too late. it was too late for wesley.}
<A>__{the kids stare emptily at wesley's earthly possessions.}
