<D>__{no, i will crush you with bare hands. hot rod transforms back to car and tries to race away... ... galvatron jumps after him and catches him... ... hot rod, nearly pinned by galvatron transforms to humanoid mode.}
<A>__{... galvatron wrestles him to his back.. ... the adolescent robot tries to fight back, but the other is stronger. ... galvatron puts his hands around hot rod's neck and starts squeezing. ... we hear the crunching of metal.}
