<A>__{margie barges through the doors. the myopic janitor is halfway up adjacent stairs peering down. no time for introductions and no time for explanations. "call the police. do it. now." shout ing up at him she's already descending. "tell em the gymnasium."}
<L>__{188: interior gymnasium. institute. night.}
<A>__{margie patrols plate glass windows. where are the fucking cops? she's shocked and looks strange indeed. wig off but hair grips all over her head. an overcoat and shoes but still wearing the nightgown underneath. a couple of dreary lights in the ceiling. helena sits numb under one of them all but hidden in a blanket. margie can't stand waiting any longer. "i'm gonna call them my self." helena nods and sure she's ok. to stay here. the doors settle and she is alone. headlights cross the windows shifting the shadows of everything. swooping the walls they move attent ion back to the door. taylor stares in and then pushes through. worse for wear but very much alive. discarded his leather jack et revealing the bullet proof vest. blood all over his t shirt. looks like he caught one in the shoulder. a bad burn and blood runs from his left hand. in his right hand he clasps the knife. he cracks it open like a whip. helena hears it and stands. ter ror as the footsteps approach. "margie. margie." but margie is n't around. he's less than 30 feet away. she tries to back off but is hindered by the blanket. tries to scream but is stifled with fear. maybe six seconds to live but this refers to taylor. "taylor" he swings around but this time he doesn't get time to look surprised. berlin blows the fucker across the room. solid load slugs weighing an ounce each crash into him. berlin keeps pumping the remington and doesn't stop firing until the magaz ine is over. no conjecture now. this bastard is very much dead. berlin throws the 12 gauge aside. and maybe it means something. maybe at last he accepts he's stopped living in that world and ready to give himself a chance in this. helena in his arms and this is his new world. flashing lights and headlights flood in to the darkness. their embrace goes on. and this story is told.}
