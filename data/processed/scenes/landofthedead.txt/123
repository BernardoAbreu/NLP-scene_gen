<A>__{riley closes the hatch. blood trickles from under his chin where cholo stuck him with the crossbow. slack reaches up and pulls off the bandana that holds back her hair, which cascades down. she uses the fabric to clean the blood off riley's neck. he looks at her, touched by the familiarity of the gesture.}
<C>__{slack}
<D>__{almost lost you there.}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{i don't get lost so easy. (to pretty boy) we gotta get across the water.}
<C>__{pretty boy}
<D>__{the bridges into the city are all bricked up.}
<A>__{pretty boy hits a button. a map appears on a monitor, showing the "golden triangle" bordered by the rivers and the barricaded bridges spanning them.}
<C>__{slack}
<D>__{we could blast our way through.}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{don't want to. if the stenches got in, there's a war going on in the city. we take any of those bridges we'll end up right in the middle of it.}
<A>__{riley runs his finger along the monitor, outlining the natural and man made barriers that protect the triangle.}
<C>__{riley }
<D>__{we've gotta come in above the throat.}
<A>__{his finger continues down the monitor to "the throat" at the base of the triangle, where the long fence runs between the two rivers.}
<C>__{riley }
<D>__{what was built to keep folks safe is gonna trap them inside. we've gotta give them a way out.}
