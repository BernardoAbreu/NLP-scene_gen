<L>__{exterior squad car night}
<A>__{parked above the abandoned garage, the interior dark. the cop and our heroes appear in the background, coming towards it.}
<C>__{irish cop}
<D>__{you're right i find it a tall tale indeed. but you seem like honest folks so i'm inclined to believe at least some of it.}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<P>__{(relieved)}
<D>__{thank you. the first thing we' have to do is find julius.}
<C>__{irish cop}
<D>__{i'm sure he'll pop up soon enough. why don't you climb in the back while i radio for backup.}
<B>__{adjust into a full shot of the back door as he swings it}
<A>__{open...but even in this darkness, we see that it's empty. they climb in. the cop opens his drivers door, and... insert dome light (second unit) the car dome light blinks on, and... angle back seat our four survivors' faces are brightly illuminated, instantly changing to gasps and screams because: their point of view (efx) julius' severed head is resting on the dash board, staring back at them!!! angle cop reacting to their terror, seeing julius' head, quickly grabbing the radio mike. but he has no time for a message because jason reaches up from the parking lot pit below, grabbing the cop's ankle, dragging him down. the radio is still in his grasp. insert dispatch radio (second unit) as the radio cord grows taut, finally snapping. the irish cop's awful yell echoes over it, silencing after a sick thud.}
