<A>__{brad is driving down the freeway, listening to the music of bruce springsteen's "out in the streets." he pries open one of the fourteen catch of the day boxes on the seat next to him and pulls out a small piece of fried fish. brad takes a bite. the look on his face says it is the worst piece of shit he has ever tasted. he throws the piece out the window, and drives on. brad turns to see a girl smiling at him from another car. it makes his afternoon. he returns the smile with gusto.}

<B>__{angle on brad}
<A>__{looking perplexed. then he realizes that he hasn't taken his ponce de leon hat off. brad drives on. a series of angles on brad's car as we see the cruising vessel move down the highway. we see the captain kidd hat go flying out the window. then the plastic sword, and the scarf. then a couple boxes of captain kidd fish. then the rest of them. we see brad rip past the ibm building.}
