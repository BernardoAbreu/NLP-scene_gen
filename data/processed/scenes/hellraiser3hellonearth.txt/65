<L>__{interior under the underground night}
<A>__{lights flash. music pounds. kids dance. it's a wild night at under the underground and it's about to get wilder. the source music (thrash metal) builds and builds, as if heading for a climax. and then the climax comes. angle on door to jp's room the door blasts open explosively from within. the pieces of the shattered door fly across the dance floor, accompanied by chunks of plaster and brick from the door surround. various angles (quick cuts) flying wood and masonry hit people. one chunk smashes into the dj console, bringing the music to a scratching, screeching end. various screams are heard off through the ensuing silence. in the confusion, kids scramble for the main doorway. is it a bomb? is it a street gang attack? the main doorway slams supernaturally shut, bolts flying into place untouched by human (or inhuman) hand. confused and frightened faces turn back to look at the source of the explosion. angle on doorway to jp's room lit from behind by blinding beams of blue light, pinhead emerges through the doorway. slow. elegant. terrifying. pinhead surveys the scene before him and the terrified and awe struck crowd look back at him. for the most part, the crowd are stunned into silence but there are a few murmurs from them;}
