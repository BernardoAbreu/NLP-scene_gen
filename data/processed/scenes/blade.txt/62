<L>__{interior pearl's bedchamber night}
<A>__{click, the line goes dead. blade tosses his satchel on the bed, opens it. inside is a hand held uv lamp hooked up to a nine volt battery. pearl eyes the device, fearful }
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{what is that?}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{a sun lamp. we're gonna play twenty questions. depending on your answers, you might get to have yourself a tanning session.}
<A>__{blade looks to pearl's monitor and sees a digitized image, the same manuscript deacon had been studying earlier.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{what were you in such a big hurry to delete just now?}
<A>__{pearl hesitates. blade turns on the lamp. pearl howls as the harsh light falls upon him. blade flicks the light off. pearl cringes, growling, his face smoking profusely. exposure to the uv rays, even for one short second, has made his face blister like a plague victim's.}
<C>__{pearl}
<P>__{(relenting)}
<D>__{it's an epistle, a letter frost has been translating it prophesizes lamagra's return.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{and who is lamagra?}
<A>__{pearl hesitates again blade turns on the lamp for a longer time. pearl thrashes, covering his face. his hands blacken, the skin sizzling away to expose the finger bones beneath. karen has to avert her gaze blade turns off the lamp. pearl snarls, his body quivering with poisonous rage.}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{lamagra is the sleeper!!!}
<A>__{blade leans in close so he's eye to eye with pearl.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{where's the original, pearl? you must have it around here somewhere.}
<A>__{pearl sweats blood, his flaking, slug like lips quivering.}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{the vault }
<A>__{blade follows pearl's eyes to an armored door, then he stands back, handing the uv rig to karen.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{if he moves, cook him.}
<A>__{blade approaches the vault door, sizing up its locking mechanism. he pulls an explosive charge from his combat belt and secures it to the door, arming it with a beep!}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{please, i will give you the combination you'll damage the documents }
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{that's the pointerior}
<A>__{enraged, pearl lunges from his bed. karen triggers the uv rig, flash frying him to a blackened crisp. pearl quivers, his enormous body smoking like a piece of charred meat. blade looks back at karen with newfound respect. she shrugs.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{he moved.}
<A>__{blade turns back to the vault, setting off the charge. boom! blade kicks the damaged door in, knocking it clear off its hinges inside the vault, ancient papers flutter through the smoky air like wind borne leaves. blade and karen see a lucite encased document fragments of an ancient, calligraphied papyrus.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what are these?}
<C>__{quinn }
<D>__{curiosity killed the cat.}
<A>__{blade and karen spin quinn, mercury, and a number of other vampires stand at the entrance to the vault.}
<C>__{quinn}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{hola, amigo. remember me?}
<A>__{karen triggers the uv light, but mercury ducks under it, ripping it from her hands, crushing it. in a split second, the she demon has her claws around karen's throat. as blade reaches for his rifle, the vampires converge on him like quicksilver. they drag karen and blade out pearl's bedchamber the vampires fling blade against the wall, pinning him.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{you took my arm, blade. but that's okay, i'm growing a new one }
<A>__{quinn lifts up his "arm". a skeletal forearm has grown from the stump. it's got cartilage, sinew, and muscle, but no flesh yet.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{nice, huh? think i will ever play the piano again?}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{you can slice him, you can dice him, and the man just keeps on coming.}
<A>__{blade struggles violently, but quinn is upon him, pounding his fist into blade again and again and again giving him payback with compounded interest. when it's over, quinn steps back, winded blade's head hangs down. he gasps, wincing, every breath sending a red hot poker to his gut. quinn grabs a hold of blade's jaw, forcing his head up.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{stay with me, sweetness, i'm not through with you yet.}
<A>__{quinn pulls blade's jacket open, sees the bandoleer of mahogany stakes. he tugs one out, admiring it.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{teak. nice craftsmanship.}
<P>__{(to the others)}
<D>__{now here's a man who takes his job just a little too seriously, don't you think?}
<P>__{(back to blade)}
<D>__{which reminds me, blade, think i owe you one }
<A>__{quinn stabs the stake into blade's shoulder. blade cries out, tries to pull free. karen, who's being held by mercury, averts her gaze.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{actually, if you want to get technical, i owe you two.}
<A>__{as quinn reaches for another stake, blade starts to laugh.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{what's so funny, bright eyes?}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{i'm expecting some company.}
<A>__{it's then that quinn notices the micro ear coil radio receiver in blade's ear. as we move in on it, we hear a tiny voice squawking from it:}
<C>__{voice}
<P>__{(filtered)}
<D>__{get down!}
<A>__{blade kicks his feet out, sending quinn flying backwards. he tears free of the vamps holding him and dives forward, knocking karen to the ground just as boom!!! the wall of pearl's bedchamber explodes inward, knocking quinn and the rest of his cronies to their feet.}
<B>__{whistler}
<A>__{stands in the smoking hole where the wall used to be, brandishing his cane in one hand and an automatic rifle in the other. he balances the rifle against his hip like an over the hill gunslinger and opens fire on the vampires. blade rolls, snatching up a fragment of the parchment which has blown free from the vault. seconds later, he and karen are fleeing after whistler, retreating back through his newly created exit.}
