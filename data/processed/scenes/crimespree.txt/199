<L>__{exterior street afternoon}
<A>__{the santana song continues as several car loads of gang bangers drive down the street.}
<L>__{interior south side social club afternoon}
<A>__{the air is thick with cigar smoke. several gumbas hang around the bar. zammito is at his table with joey "two tons" and nicky "the rake." dean martin "return to me" plays on the jukebox. outside we hear the sound of cars pulling up and screeching to a stop. the door opens and raphael and ten other very tough looking gang members step inside. the room falls silent, except for dino on the jukebox. zammito stands up.}
<C>__{raphael}
<D>__{anybody know about that car outside?}
<C>__{zammito}
<D>__{yeah. it's mine.}
<C>__{raphael}
<D>__{no. it's mine.}
<C>__{zammito}
<D>__{the hell it is.}
<C>__{raphael}
<D>__{i'm telling you that's my car! and someone's gonna pay for it!}
<C>__{zammito}
<D>__{and i'm tellin' you it ain't! now, turn your taco eating ass around and get the hell out of here.}
<C>__{raphael}
<D>__{fuck you, grease ball!}
<C>__{zammito}
<D>__{fuck me? fuck you!}
<A>__{they are right on the edge of having a major disaster. the dean martin song ends. dead quiet. each group watches the other to see who's going to make the first move. the jukebox selects another record. the needle scratches against the vinyl intro. we hear the intro to jerry vale singing "amore scusami".}
<B>__{series of quick cuts}
<A>__{ raphael's eyes burn into zammito's a gang bangers eyes dart from side to side. a wiseguy bites his lip. nicky "the rake" twitches his fingers nervously. sweat glistens on the forehead of joey "two tons". at the bar eddie reaches behind for something without looking. he knocks over a bottle. it falls to the floor and breaks. the noise is enough to push things over the edge.}
<C>__{jerry vale's voice}
<D>__{my love, forgive me...}
<A>__{raphael goes for his gun. all hell breaks loose! people dive for cover as shots rings out. in the close quarters it's like shooting fish in a barrel.}
<C>__{jerry vale's voice}
<D>__{i didn't mean to have it end like this...}
<A>__{eddie lifts a shotgun from behind the bar and blows away a gang member. another gang member kills him. it's a massacre! bodies drop like flies. the room is so thick with smoke you can't see two feet in front of you. finally it is quiet.}
<C>__{jerry vale's voice}
<D>__{i didn't mean to have you fall in love, in love with me...}
<A>__{we move through the room, past the carnage. smoke swirls, blood covers the floor. raphael is dead. along with joey "two tons" and nicky "the rake" on the floor, zammito is against the bar. he sits up, amazed that he is untouched. he gets to his feet and makes his way to the front door.}
