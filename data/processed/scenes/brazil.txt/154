<A>__{sam's face is reflected in the puddle of oil. he is staring wide eyed. a church bell tolls in the distance. sam is definitely spooked. he scrambles to his feet. he's got to get out of here. he heads off down the passageway but is brought quickly to a halt. there, in the shadows, is someone smoking a cigarette. he hesitates and reverses direction but, before he manages 2 paces a familiar voice comes from behind him.}
