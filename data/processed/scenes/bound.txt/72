<A>__{she slaps him hard. he stares at her.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{i'm sorry, violet, but it has to be this way.}
<A>__{he moves past her, picks up the dresses and returns them to the closet.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{i hope you understand. i want to trust you, i want to believe you, but i don't have any other choice.}
