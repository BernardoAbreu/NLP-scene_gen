<C>__{hawk}
<P>__{("what's my line")}
<D>__{that's two down to kitty carlisle...}
<A>__{hawk "weighs" the two bars in his hands digs with his fingernails. he rips off the blindfold in subdued frustration. as minerva speaks, she unconsciously molests alfred.}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{cool, isn't it? weight, feel, mal1eability, they're all but identical. on the periodic chart of elements, they're but one proton apart. great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{alchemy.}
<C>__{darwin}
<P>__{(casually goosing alfred)}
<D>__{alchemy! is the business term of the 90's, my man! minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago. i dumped some lira into research... shazam, we come across a diary by one of da vinci's apprentices detailing la machine de oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history. money isn't everything, gold is. fuck blue chip stocks! fuck t bills! fuck junk bonds! i got the real deal! money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{market crashes. bomb drops. greenhouse effect affects. we'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world. in 1992, europe is coming together to become one business superpower. it's one party we'd love to poop.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{well, that said, the last ingredient in the recipe is in, get this, you're gonna die, the kremlin.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{sure. the kremlin. makes sense. the kremlin. why not? listen, this is all too indiana jones and the lost city of king tut for me, man. throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw alex...}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{jail, you asshole! our foot soldiers will blow your brains out! bunny, ball ball!}
<A>__{minerva angrily throws the dog off her lap and whips a tennis ball into its mouth.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{i will torture you so slowly you'll think it's a career! i will kill your family, your friends, and the bitch you took to the prom!}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{you want an address on that last one?}
<A>__{bunny barks up at hawk in anger.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{bunny, not you too?}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{you've got a dilemma, tiger. i think i know what's going to help you solve it.}
<A>__{alfred quickly latches on the state of the art handcuffs and the blindfold. the viewer's viewpoint stays on a writhing hawk.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{i will kill all you. even the old lady.}
<A>__{hawk kicks back on the table, "jump ropes" the cuffs, then picks the lock with his teeth. hawk rips off the blindfold to see that the entire room is empty except for alex, standing at the other end, in an incongruous italian leather coat.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i hated cigarettes until i saw my first no smoking sign. keep off the grass? let's play soccer. only law i cared about was friendship. broke that one too, didn't i? this gates mario brothers cia mayflower da vinci thing seemed like a sweet deal. visit foreign lands, take their treasures. i don't know, i thought you'd get into it. it's better than playing darts with m.b.a.'s at the bar. i didn't know it was going to be like this. them using me to use you... i'm sorry, there's only one way out of this and it's gonna hurt me more than it's gonna hurt you.}
