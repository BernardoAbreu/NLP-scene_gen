<A>__{malkovich is in convulsions on the floor. big dramatic convulsions. truman scoops him up, and places him on the bench. malkovich continues with the convulsions, milking it. truman speaks.}

<D>__{here ... here ... sssh ... sssh ... calm now ... lie back. just lie back! now breathe in deep. very deep. in ... out ... in ... out ... that's it ... in. out .. in ... out ...}
<A>__{malkovich is breathing insanely now, trying to keep the focus on himself. flemmer is in the catwalks, watching the crowd. the audience is watching malkovich.}

<D>__{bastard is stealing my thunder.}
<A>__{malkovich and truman on the stage. truman is pacing, swirling, dancing, juggling enormous bowling pins as he talks.}
<C>__{harry s. truman puppet}
<D>__{all right! i will take it away! he'll be delivered from madness. what then? he'll feel himself acceptable! what then?}
<A>__{malkovich has upped his convulsions now. he watches truman out of the corner of his eye while writhing tormentedly on the bench. he levitates. spins in mid air. falls on all fours and does an uncanny impression of a yelping dog. truman watches malkovich, continues to speak. but now, when he talks, fire comes out of his mouth.}
<C>__{harry s. truman puppet }
<D>__{i will heal the rash on his body. i will erase the welts cut into his body by flying manes.}
<A>__{the audience "ooohs" at the flames. malkovich rips off his clothes and convulses into the dying swan bit from "swan lake." the audience applauds. truman continues his speech, now transforming himself into an actual 60 foot swan and flying around the auditorium as he speaks.}
<C>__{harry s. truman puppet }
<D>__{you won't gallop anymore, alan. horses will be quite safe. you'll save your pennies every week, till you can change that scooter into a car...}
<A>__{the audience watches the giant swan overhead, necks craned, in awe. malkovich sighs. he is out of his league. he goes into a remarkable tap dance routine and sings "mr. bojangles", but nobody even looks at the stage. the giant swan bursts into flames, flies back onto the stage, burns to a crisp, then rises from his ashes as the actual harry s. truman. truman looks confused and disoriented, as if just raised from the dead.}
<C>__{actual truman}
<D>__{where am i? aren't i dead?}
<P>__{(possessed)}
<D>__{vote for mantini!}
<A>__{truman grows and grows until he is again just a giant puppet. the audience bursts into applause, then delivers a standing ovation. truman bows. flemmer laughs wildly in the catwalks. malkovich walks dejectedly from the stage.}
