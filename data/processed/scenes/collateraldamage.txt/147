<L>__{exterior river}
<A>__{gordy hears the l.o.h. again. the three of them duck again, and... whoom! the chopper zips by just overhead. and continues on. a moment later, gordy, mauro and selena re surface. off them, as the copper recedes upriver...}
<L>__{exterior river dawn}
<A>__{gordy and selena float side by side, still holding onto the cans. mauro's asleep on gordy's back, his arms around gordy's neck. weakened by her wound, selena keeps bobbing below the surface. gordy pulls her up.}
<C>__{gordy}
<D>__{hang on. we just have to keep floating a little bit more...}
<A>__{suddenly, in the growing light, gordy sees selena's blood in the water and realizes she's wounded.}
<C>__{gordy}
<D>__{you were shot.}
<C>__{selena}
<D>__{... i'm okay.}
<C>__{gordy}
<D>__{we gotta get you outta the river.}
<B>__{gordy}
<A>__{kicks them all to shore. he climbs out of the river carrying mauro. as gordy ascends the bank, mauro wakes up, terrified. gordy tries to soothe him.}
<C>__{gordy}
<D>__{esta bien. esta bien.}
<A>__{but mauro squirms free, and immediately, mauro runs back to his mother. selena uses sign language to tell him everything's okay. off gordy's surprised look }
<C>__{selena}
<D>__{he can't hear or speak.}
<A>__{gordy just looks at them a moment. then moves to selena. re: mauro, as gordy examines her arm }
<C>__{selena}
<D>__{he's a war orphan. i adopted him.}
<A>__{beat. gordy finishes checking the bullet wound.}
<C>__{gordy}
<D>__{you're lucky.}
<A>__{he uses part of his shirt to make a pressure bandage. as he ties it around selena's arm, she looks around.}
<C>__{selena}
<D>__{i know where we are. there's a secret trail nearby that leads toward mompos.}
<C>__{gordy}
<D>__{can you walk?}
<C>__{selena}
<D>__{it's just my arm.}
<A>__{gordy admires this woman's bravery. selena stands. mauro's clutching her skirt. gordy looks at him.}
<C>__{gordy}
<D>__{how do you say 'hello'?}
<A>__{selena looks at gordy a moment. she signs "hello" for him, her seashells clacking as she does it. gordy taps mauro to get his attention. tries out the sign for "hello." the boy just looks at him... then reaches out and takes gordy's hand, shows him the correct way to do it. gordy tries again. mauro nods "yes" and smiles. gordy smiles back.}
