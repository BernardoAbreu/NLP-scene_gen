<L>__{interior sherry novotny's backyard day}
<A>__{a laughing baby boy is lowered into frame and pulled back up again. then he swings across frame. it's little darryl novotny. wide jim has darryl by the ankles and is swinging him between his legs. diane and sherry are setting the picnic table. stacked charcoal briquettes burn off in a nearby barbecue.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{around that time diane and i were hanging out a lot at sherry novotny's house, giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{jim, don't. you're scaring him.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{he likes it.}
<A>__{darryl's laughter suddenly turns into crying}
<C>__{diane}

<D>__{is little darryl dizzy? that's it. . come here. . .}
<C>__{sherry}
<D>__{you got him?}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{sherry heads into the house. jim watches her walk, then turns toward diane and darryl. it's as though diane, not sherry, were the infant's real mother, so loving and attentive is she, so swelled with maternal piety.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{diane really wanted to have kids and so did i but it seemed like there was always a reason to wait: she had to finish nursing school, i had to get my masters, we needed a new house, we needed more money. finally we just decided to go for it...}
