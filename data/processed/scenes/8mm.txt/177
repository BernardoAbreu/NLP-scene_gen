<L>__{interior dino velvet's office day}
<A>__{thug opens the door and lets welles and max in. the office is huge, windowless walls covered in thousands of pictures from every conceivable source, torn and cut, pinned up to form an indecipherable collage. a tall ladder leans against one wall, near three televisions. dino velvet rises behind his desk, a small, bird like man, wearing a black suit and bad hairpiece.}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{come in. make yourself comfortable.}
<A>__{welles shakes dino's hand. max looks up at the walls. images; porn pictures, news photos, world leaders, autopsy photos, armies and insects, the naked and the dead.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{it's an honor to meet you. thank you for seeing us.}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{what can i do for you today?}
<A>__{welles sits. shelves behind dino's desk are piled high with video cassettes, old movie cameras, big reels of 16mm film. videos and magazines are stacked everywhere.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{i'd like to commission a work. i'm a great admirer of yours.}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{flattering. and, who's your colorful little chum?}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{a fellow investor.}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{hmm.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you're the only one still shooting film and transferring it to video. nobody appreciates that kind of integrity anymore... the grain, the gritty look you get.}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{well, i'm glad you appreciate it.}
<P>__{(to welles)}
<D>__{what would you say is your favorite piece?}
<A>__{welles considers. max glances over, looks back to the walls.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i know if i had to pick, it'd be "choke," or "devil."}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{"devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but i'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.}
<A>__{dino grins, showing yellowed teeth.}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{you said something about money.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{yes. what we're looking for is rather specific.}
<A>__{welles takes out an envelope, puts it on the desk.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{that's five thousand dollars.}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{is it?}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. hard bondage, or course. other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, i have only two stipulations.}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{and they are?}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{i want to watch you work.}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{i will consider it.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{and the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{machine.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{if it's not him, there's no deal.}
<A>__{dino drums his painted fingernails on his lips.}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{he might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{we can do that.}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{well, well, i will have to put my thinking cap on about all this. you'll leave the money as a deposit?}
<P>__{(off welles' nod)}
<D>__{very good.}
<A>__{dino stands, picks up a still camera off his desk and comes to look at welles, studying him.}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{you have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it. i'd like to take your picture. you don't mind?}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{i'd rather you didn't.}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{what's the problem?}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{i'm camera shy.}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{you trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{those are two different kinds of trust.}
<P>__{(stands)}
<D>__{thank you for your time. i hope we can do business.}
<A>__{welles leaves. max goes with him. dino watches them leave.}
