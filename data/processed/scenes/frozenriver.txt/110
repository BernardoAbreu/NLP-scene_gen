<L>__{exterior ray's trailer yard day}
<A>__{ray slips on her boots, grabs her jacket around her and steps outside the trailer door.}
<C>__{trooper napoli}
<D>__{this is about the woman who was with you.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{trooper napoli}
<D>__{how long have you known her?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{not too long. she looks after my kids.}
<C>__{trooper napoli}
<D>__{she's a smuggler.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{trooper napoli}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{wow. that's a shock.}
<C>__{trooper napoli}
<D>__{yes, well, there is that element on the reservation i'm sure you know.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{yeah, i've heard about it but i didn't know she was involved.}
<C>__{trooper napoli}
<D>__{how did you happen to meet her?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{uh, i think there was a sign for a baby sitter at the wolf mart. that's where i get my gas.}
<C>__{trooper napoli}
<D>__{i just thought you should be aware of that. she's known to have smuggled illegal immigrants into the country.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<A>__{he nods his head.}
<C>__{trooper napoli}
<D>__{if i were you i'd find a new baby sitter. you don't want her around young kids.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<A>__{he eyes the side of the trailer where smoke stained siding is visible.}
<C>__{trooper napoli}
<D>__{well, you have an enjoyable holiday.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{thanks. you, too.}
<A>__{ray stands and watches the trooper drive away. she feels in the pocket of her bathrobe for her cigarettes and fumbles to light one, sucking on it, unaware of the cold. when she turns around she looks at the trailer and notices the smoke stained siding on one end of it.}
