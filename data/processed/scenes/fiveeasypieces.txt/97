<L>__{interior catherine's bedroom day}
<A>__{she stands in front of a dresser mirror, pinning up her hair, preparatory to taking a bath. her attention is drawn to... ... bobby entering, and as he crosses to her, she quickly turns back to the mirror.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you think i'm a fake.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i think it's what you think.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{no, it isn't what i think.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{look... you made a very calculated move, and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you. that wasn't necessary.}
<A>__{she moves away from him and he follows her.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{yes, it was. you've made it clear that if i can cut a little piano, i might get a little response.}
<C>__{catherine}
<P>__{(stops and turns to him)}
<D>__{i don't think that's accurate...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{up to now, what i've been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after tomorrow...}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i'm not conscious of having given you any meaningful looks. and as for the day after tomorrow, this is the day after tomorrow, and i am, unfortunately, seeing you... now if you'll excuse me, i'd like to take a bath.}
<A>__{she moves back to the dresser and as she begins searching through an array of bath oils on top of it, bobby steps in beside her.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{it's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i'm not faking anything. i'm looking for some bath oil...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{some bath oil?}
<A>__{he lifts up one of the bottles.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{what about this one?}
<P>__{(picking up another)}
<D>__{or this one?}
<P>__{(and another)}
<D>__{how about some jasmine?}
<P>__{(and another)}
<D>__{what about some musk?}
<C>__{cathfrine}
<D>__{what are you doing!}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(knocking the bottles over)}
<D>__{what are you doing, screwing around with this crap?!}
<A>__{a little intimidated by his aggressivity:}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i don't find your language that charming.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{it's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i'd like you to leave now. is that direct enough?}
<A>__{he makes no move to go.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{you're not a serious person, by your own admission. and that may be interesting, but it doesn't interest me...}
<A>__{needing the safety of distance, she moves over to the windows next to the bed. again, he follows after her.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{serious, that's what's important to you?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{yes, that's what's important to me...}
<A>__{he takes her by the shoulders...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{okay, let's be serious...}
<A>__{... and forces her onto the bed.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{no, don't do that...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{shut up...}
<A>__{he hesitates for a moment, full of things he wants to say and cannot. catherine looks up at him, uttering a quiet challenge:}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{no inner feeling.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i don't believe vou.}
<A>__{he leans down to her, begins kissing her. her arms encircle him and laying back on the bed, she pulls his body onto hers, fervently returning his kisses. and as he responds with an ardor absent of fakery and full of a lifetime of derelict feelings, a fade over begins, to:}
