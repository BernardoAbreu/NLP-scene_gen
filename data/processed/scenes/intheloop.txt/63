<L>__{interior state department day}
<A>__{simon and toby walk out into a larger office. they find a couple of seats left out for people waiting and sit down. various staffers come and go, picking up papers and files, saying hi, looking knackered, all drinking either diet cokes or coffees.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{was that...?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{toby i don't want to read you the riot act here but i am going to have to read some extracts from the riot act. like section 1 paragraph 1 clause 1. don't leave your boss twisting in the wind and then burst in late smelling like a pissed seaside donkey.}
<P>__{(special needs)}
<D>__{`the british are coming'?}
<C>__{toby}
<P>__{(feels he's taken enough now)}
<D>__{so i turned up late to the meeting simon. i'm sorry. but it's not like i threw up in there.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{no you're right. i should be thanking you for not throwing up. well done. you're a star. you didn't wet yourself, you're in the right city, you didn't say anything overtly racist, you didn't pull your dick out and start plucking it and shouting 'willy banjo'. no i'm being unfair, you got so much right. without actually being there for the beginning of one of the biggest meetings of my career. you're a legend.}
<A>__{an uncomfortable beat.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{that was just the first bit was it? we're going back in do you ...think?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{we'd barely said hello. i've had muggings that have lasted longer than that. we really only spoke about flammable cheese.}
<A>__{liza comes out, passes by. toby mouths `shit' to himself.}
<C>__{liza}
<P>__{(looking at a list on her desk, then to a staffer)}
<D>__{are these all requests to get on the committee? what's going on? did someone post an invite on facebook? i'm drowning in senators. it's senator soup here.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{hi liza.}
<A>__{they're uncomfy with each other.}
<C>__{liza}
<D>__{hey toby.}
<A>__{toby gets up for a private word.}
<C>__{toby}
<P>__{(re last night)}
<D>__{you feeling okay?}
<C>__{liza}
<D>__{yes, i'm feeling fine. why were you late?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{because...you know...you didn't wake me up.}
<C>__{liza}
<D>__{you looked so sweet. i thought you knew what you were doing.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i was asleep, of course i didn't. that's how people walk out of windows.}
<C>__{staffer}
<P>__{((hand over phone, calls over)}
<D>__{hey liza, i've got another call about the committee from senator crudden's office, he wants in too.}
<C>__{liza}
<D>__{what is going on here? fuck. why's this my problem? toby you sure you didn't do bad? you didn't mention the committee to anyone else?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{nada. nada.. bad da. nada bada bing bong ding dang dong.}
<P>__{(beat, she looks at him)}
<D>__{i have no idea what i'm saying anymore i think i really am still quite drunk.}
<A>__{chad is passing. as liza turns away toby's face does a spasm of regret at his brazen lying.}
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{everyone is so hot for your paper. i'm running off another ten copies. it's spreading like a virus, liza. you're in hot water. you're lobsterising.}
<C>__{liza}
<D>__{i don't feel that.}
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{it's by degrees. wafting. bisque. i smell lobster. can you smell lobster, toby?}
<A>__{simon calls toby back over.}
<C>__{simon }
<D>__{mate!}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i need to...}
<C>__{liza}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{toby goes back to simon}
<C>__{liza }
<D>__{so, how far would you go with linton, you freaky little stalker? downtown? or all the way up brokeback mountain?}
