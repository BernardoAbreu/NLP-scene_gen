<A>__{a small room with arched windows that look over the city. fredrick is pulling a notebook and pen from under an upturned table. he scrawls rapidly, screws the message into a tight tube, then puts it into a metal cylinder he finds beneath the table also. he glances out a window, notices a figure standing beneath a street lamp below, looking up at him. startled, fredrick darts back into shadow, goes to a wall covered in about a dozen vertical pipes running up into the ceiling. tight on one of the pipes he opens a small hatch and puts the metal cylinder in it. the cylinder is snatched from his hand, sucked into the pipe with a rush of air.}
