<A>__{a bell rings as dwight's buick screeches to a stop and toby gets out. as he heads toward the doors. toby then turns to stare at dwight's car. they lock eyes, then dwight smirks and pulls away. toby watches the car disappear, then spins around and walks into the school.}
<T>__{fade out: fade up to:}
<A>__{same scene afternoon the camera is in the exact same spot. the school seems a bit seedier, and two newly planted saplings established in the previous scene are both eight feet taller, with wide spreading branches. students pour out the door. among them toby, taller and a bit heavier, he now wears black leather boots, and a pack of cigarettes rolled into the sleeve of his t shirt. his hair is still pure elvis. toby comes back out the door with four very different friends. chuck bolger, the most reasonable looking of toby's companions, is the son of a minister. a second boy, known as psycho, is a hulking boy with a tendency toward sadism. jerry huff is handsome in a pouty, heavy lidded way. his elvis pompadour is even higher than toby's. arch cook is an amiable simpleton who sometimes talks to himself or laughs for no reason. toby and his four friends pile into chuck bolger's '53 chevy, and they peel out.}
