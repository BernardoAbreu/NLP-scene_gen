<L>__{interior harvard law school day}
<A>__{speaking to a packed student audience.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{...my high school was the black ghetto of roxbury. my college was the streets of harlem, and i took my masters in prison. if you look out the window }
<A>__{shot malcolm's old gang hangout}
<C>__{malcolm's voice}
<D>__{ you can see my burglary hangout. i lived like an animal. had it not been for the honorable elijah muhammad i would surely be in an insane asylum or dead.}
<A>__{angle the audience carefully listening.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{mr. muhammad is trying to get us on god's side, so god will be on our side to help us fight our battles. when negroes stop getting drunk, stop being addicted to drugs, stop fornicating and committing adultery. when we get off the welfare, then we'll be men. earn what you need for your family, then your family respects you. they'll be proud to say "that's my father." she's proud to say "that's my husband..." father means you're taking care of those children. just 'cause you made them that don't mean you're a father. anybody can make a baby, but anybody can't take care of them. anyone can go and get a woman but anybody can't take care of a woman. this is the type of teaching that the honorable elijah muhammad teaches us so we can build the moral fiber of our people.}
<B>__{shot of reporters in audience}
<A>__{beginning to scribble furiously.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i can see the gentlemen of the press, also the fbi and cia. are with us. get it straight 'cuz if i said, "mary had a little lamb," they'd write malcolm x lampoons poor mary.}
<A>__{loud laughter from the audience. but this response is overwhelmed by the response of another, larger audience.}
