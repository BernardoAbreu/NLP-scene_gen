<L>__{exterior hunters' camp day}
<A>__{metal container doors clang to the ground, jeep engines roar to life in a cloud of thick black diesel smoke, blue laser barriers sizzle and burn through foliage as this group of hunters establishes a perimeter around their new camp. peter ludlow, dressed in brand new banana republic safari wear, steps into the center of the camp and surveys the surroundings. he turns to dr. robert burke, a ragged, pony tailed man in wire rimmed glasses.}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{welcome to your dream come true, dr. burke.}
<A>__{burke has a detailed set of satellite recon photographs that he spreads out on the hood of a jeep.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{i believe the large herbivores forage in open plains, like bison, which would explain the great variety of heat dots we're reading in the flatlands around this waterhole. right here.}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{then that's where we're going.}
<A>__{burke flips open a manifest that he will carry with him at all times. inside, there are dozens of sketches of various kinds underneath. as each vehicle roars out of the equipment container, burke slips a waterproof eight by ten card with an icon of the various dinosaurs on the island into a slot in the dashboard.}
<C>__{burke}
<P>__{(calling them off)}
<D>__{hadrosaurus! carinthosaurus! maiasaurus!}
<A>__{as the procession goes on, ludlow turns to dieter stark, the man we saw welding earlier.}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{this is as good a place as any for base camp. first priority is the laser barriers, i want them all up and running in thirty minutes. half an hour, understand?}
<A>__{dieter nods and turns to some of the hunters, who number about twenty in all, that are working nearby. but someone steps in front of dieter, cutting him off. it's roland tembo, the hunter from the bar in mombassa.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{cancel that, dieter.}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{what? why?}
<A>__{roland points to a stream running nearby.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{carnivores hunt near stream beds. do you want to set up base camp or an all you can eat people bar?}
<C>__{ludlow}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{you heard his, dieter. find a new spot. and remember, we're after herbivores only no unnecessary risks.}
<A>__{dieter sighs and goes to work. roland puts an arm around ludlow and pulls him aside.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions. first i'm in charge, and when i'm not around, dieter is. your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day. second condition my fee. you can keep it. all i want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs. a male. buck only. why and how are my business. if you don't like either of those conditions, you're on your own. go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all i care. but i've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas. okay?}
<C>__{ludlow}
<P>__{(what else can he say?)}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{good lad.}
