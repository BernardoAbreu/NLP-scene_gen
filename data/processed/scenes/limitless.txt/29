<A>__{a dishevelled eddie opens the door to his apartment. he enters, looks around.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{happy and sore, i returned home.}
<A>__{eddie's pov his living room it's the first wide shot we've seen of it, and it hammers home: what a mess. books scattered across the floor, dirty dishes, broken venetian blind sashes. the nest of a slob.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{... but it couldn't be my home, could it? who would live like this?}
<A>__{montage: speeded up shots of eddie sifting through his books and tapes. cleaning up the kitchen. the bathroom. picks up books. he starts moving the sofa. quick cuts: the living room, rapidly whipped into shape. if not stylish, habitable. final shot: he's sitting on the (repositioned) couch. thinking.}
<D>__{eddie (v.0.) (cont'd) what was this drug? i couldn't stay messy on it, i hadn't had a cigarette in six hours...}
<A>__{he stares at the pack in his hands. it looks alien.}
<D>__{eddie (v.0.) (cont'd) ...hadn't eaten... so. abstemious and tidy. what was this a drug for people who want to get anal?}
<A>__{he gets up. paces.}
<D>__{eddie (v.0.) (cont'd) i wasn't high, wasn't wired just clear. what i needed to do. and how to do it.}
<A>__{his eye falls on his computer. the montage continues: eddie flipping through research books, typing onto his keyboard, the printer printing, doing internet searches... pages and pages spit out of the printer.}
