<C>__{henry}
<D>__{this your husband?}
<A>__{violated somehow, she gets up and snatches it out of his hands. she puts it in a drawer and cringes as henry plays one note on the piano.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{stop that.}
<A>__{he fixes her with a steady, knowing stare which causes her to gather the collar of her bathrobe up around her neck. she steps back, exposed, when there's a knock at the door. they look over to see... mr deng enter with the notebook.}
<C>__{mr deng}
<P>__{(nods to mary, then)}
<D>__{mr fool, what is this?}

<C>__{fay}
<P>__{(fed up)}
<D>__{fine! you do it, simon! i don't care!}
<A>__{she storms out to the top of the stairs, cocks her hip and whines...}
<C>__{fay}
<D>__{mom! simon's got a broken rib, his shoulder's dislocated or something, and he won't let me disinfect the gash in his head!}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{fay, just take him to the hospital, will ya!}
<C>__{fay}
<P>__{(stamping her foot)}
<D>__{but he won't go!}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{simon grim, you go to the hospital with fay right now, do hear me!}
<A>__{simon reaches out and slams the bathroom door. fay looks from the bathroom door down the stairs to mary. mary, her nerves rattled, glances over at mr deng, who turns and leaves the house. henry lights a fresh cigarette, loosens his tie and heads upstairs.}
