<A>__{she's not cool. not unemotional.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{do you people have earwax, of what? we have been here three hours. how many different ways do you want me to tell the same story?}
<A>__{she faces the eight members of the board of inquiry at a long conference table. gray suits and grim faces. they aren't buying. behind ripley on a large video screen, parker grins like a goon from his personnel mugshot. his file prints out next to it. brett's face and dossier replace it, and then the others as the scene continues... kane, lambert, ash the android traitor, dallas. van leuwen, the icc representative, steeples his fingers and frowns.}
<C>__{van leuwen}
<D>__{look at it from our perspective. you freely admit to detonating the engines of, and thereby destroying, an m class star freighter. a rather expensive piece of hardware...}
<C>__{insurance investigator}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{forty two million in adjusted dollars. that's minus payload, of course.}
<C>__{van leuwen}
<D>__{the shuttle's flight recorder corroborates some elements of your account. that the nostromo set down on lv 426, an unsurveyed planet, at that time. that repairs were made. that it resumed its course and was subsequently set for self destruct. by you. for reasons unknown.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{look, i told you...}
<C>__{van leuwen}
<D>__{it did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.}
<A>__{ripley sense the noose tightening.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{then somebody's gotten to it... doctored the recorder. who had access to it?}
<A>__{the eca (extrasolar colonization administration) representative (eca rep) just shakes his head.}
<C>__{eca rep}
<D>__{would you just listen to yourself for one minute.}
<A>__{ripley glares at the eca rep, a woman on the ungenerous side of fifty. van leuwen sighs with exasperation.}
<C>__{van leuwen}
<D>__{the analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(losing it)}
<D>__{that's because i blew it out the goddamn airlock!}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{like i said.}
<C>__{insurance man}
<P>__{(to eca rep)}
<D>__{are there any species like this 'hostile organism' on lv 426?}
<C>__{eca rep}
<D>__{no. it's a rock. no indigenous life larger than a simple virus.}
<A>__{ripley grits her teeth in frustration.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i told you, it wasn't indigenous. there was an alien spacecraft there. a derelict ship. we homed on its beacon...}
<C>__{eca rep}
<D>__{to be perfectly frank, we've surveyed over three hundred worlds and no one's ever reported a creature which, using your words...}
<P>__{(read from ripley's statement)}
<D>__{...'gestates in a living human host' and has 'concentrated molecular acid for blood.'}
<A>__{ripley glances at burke, silent at the far end of the table. his expression is grim. her mouth hardens as a bit of the old nail eating ripley surfaces.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{look, i can see where this is going. but i'm telling you those things exist. back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs. thousands. do you understand? i suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data. find it and deal with it before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...}
<C>__{van leuwen}
<D>__{thank you, officer ripley. that will be...}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(louder, stepping on him)}
<D>__{...because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew, within twelve hours of hatching...}
<A>__{van leuwen stands, out of patience.}
<C>__{van leuwen}
<D>__{thank you, that will be all.}
<A>__{ripley stares him down, glowering at the board.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{that's not all, goddamnit! if those things get back here, that will be all. then you can just kiss it good bye, jack! just kiss it goodbye.}
<A>__{ripley turns sharply away, trembling with frustration and anger. dallas looks back at her from the video screen, his eyes burning from the photograph, as we:}
