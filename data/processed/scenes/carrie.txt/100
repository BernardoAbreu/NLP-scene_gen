<A>__{carrie turns on a light. she undresses slowly, wearily. and then she stops and looks at herself in the mirror. a close, tired inspection. her eyes seem hollow, haunted. carrie doesn't like what she sees; she doesn't like herself. flex. slowly cracks appear in the mirror, spiderwebs. flex. the mirror cracks wider. and flex: the mirror shatters, crashes to the dresser in pieces, loudly; some of the pieces fall on the floor.}
