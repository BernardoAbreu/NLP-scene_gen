<L>__{interior the apartment evening}
<A>__{buddy boy is bending over a hot stove, preparing an italian dinner. he takes a saucepan of spaghetti off the fire, and picking up the tennis racquet with the other hand, pours the spaghetti on top of the racquet strings. then he turns on the faucet, runs water over the spaghetti. with the combined technique of brillat savarin and pancho gonzales, he gently agitates the racquet, letting the water drain off the spaghetti. as he works, he hums a theme from tschaikowsky's capriccio italien. fran walks in, still in her robe.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{are we dressing for dinner?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{no just come as you are.}
<C>__{fran}
<P>__{(watching him)}

<P>__{(demonstrates)}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{shall i light the candles?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{it's a must gracious living wise.}
<A>__{as fran starts into the living room, bud begins to ladle meat sauce onto the spaghetti, humming operatically. in the living room, the small table has been set for two, and prominent on it is the champagne bottle that mr. kirkeby left behind, still in its cardboard bucket, but freshly iced. as fran lights the candles, she notices the napkins on the table, peels a price tag off the corner of one of them.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{i see you bought some napkins.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{might as well go all the way.}
<A>__{he carries the platter of spaghetti and meat sauce in from the kitchen, sets it on the table, sprinkles some cheese on it. then he crosses to the coffee table, where a full martini pitcher stands in readiness, fills a couple of glasses. fran seats herself at the table.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{you know, i used to live like robinson crusoe shipwrecked among eight million people. then one day i saw a footprint in the sand and there you were }
<P>__{(hands her martini)}
<D>__{it's a wonderful thing dinner for two.}

<D>__{we're going to finish that gin game.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{so i want you to keep a clear head.}
<A>__{the door bell rings. carrying his martini glass, bud crosses to the door, starts to open it.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{because i don't want to take advantage of you the way i did yesterday in bed.}
<A>__{by now the door is open, and bud is speaking to fran over his shoulder. he turns, finds himself face to face with karl matuschka, who is standing grimly in the doorway.}
<C>__{matuschka}
<D>__{baxter?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{yes?}
<A>__{matuschka shoves him roughly aside, strides past him toward fran, who has risen to her feet.}
<C>__{matuschka}
<D>__{what's with you, fran did you forget where you live?}
<C>__{fran}
<P>__{(to bud)}
<D>__{this is my brother in law, karl matuschka.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(friendly)}
<D>__{how do you do, mr. matuschka?}

<C>__{bud}
<D>__{now, wait a minute. i know what you're thinking but it's not as bad as it looks }
<C>__{matuschka}
<P>__{(shoving him away)}
<D>__{it's none of my business what you do, fran you're over twenty one but your sister happens to think you're a lady.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{all we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes }
<C>__{matuschka}
<P>__{(grabbing him)}
<D>__{look, buddy boy if there wasn't a lady present, i'd clobber you.}
<C>__{fran}
<P>__{(separating them)}
<D>__{all right, karl i will get dressed.}
<A>__{she exits into the bedroom, removing her dress from the door, and closing it. matuschka leans against the wall beside the hall door, eyeing bud truculently. bud raises a finger to remonstrate with him then breaks into a nervous, ingratiating smile.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{care for a martini? champagne?}
<P>__{(matuschka continues glaring at him)}
<D>__{how about a little spaghetti with meat sauce? made it myself.}
<P>__{(matuschka just scowls)}
<D>__{your sister in law sure is terrific }
<P>__{(realizes his mistake; switching abruptly)}
<D>__{must be murder driving a cab in new york i mean, with all that cross town traffic }
<A>__{he gestures with the martini glass, spilling the contents over his shirtfront. through the partly open hall door, dr. dreyfuss sticks his head in.}
<C>__{dr. dreyfuss}
<D>__{hi, baxter.}
<A>__{he steps into the apartment, passing matuschka without seeing him.}
<C>__{dr. dreyfuss}
<D>__{how's the patient?}

<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{oh, i'm fine, doc.}

<D>__{oh, not that kind. he just gave her a shot and pumped her stomach out }
<A>__{behind them, the bedroom door has opened, and fran comes out, wearing her coat over her dress.}
<C>__{matuschka}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{fran}
<P>__{(coming up)}
<D>__{because i took some sleeping pills. but i'm all right now so let's go.}

<D>__{on account of me.}
<C>__{matuschka}
<P>__{(whirling on him)}
<D>__{you?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{who else?}
<A>__{matuschka lashes out with a left to bud's jaw, and while he is off balance, catches him with a right to the eye. bud falls back against the christmas tree, which topples with a crash. fran pulls matuschka away from him.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{leave him alone, karl.}
<A>__{she kneels beside bud.}
<C>__{fran}
