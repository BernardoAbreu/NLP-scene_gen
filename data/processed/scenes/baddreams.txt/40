<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{cynthia bolts up out of bed.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{the candles are out. victor isn't in the room. cynthia, drenched with sweat, slowly catches her breath. she looks around, confused.}
<C>__{cynthia }
<D>__{vic?}
<A>__{she goes into the other room.}
<L>__{interior living room}
<A>__{no vic. it is dark except for a fire in the fireplace. the flames reflect oddly on the slick surface of the oil painting of unity house.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{vic?}
<A>__{she checks in the kitchen. nothing. she looks back in the bedroom. the apartment is empty. she's just calming when meeow! the cat leaps out of nowhere, startling her, and then running out of sight. she swallows. very nervous now, she sits on the couch and starts pulling on her jeans and shoes. the camera moves around her, revealing the entire apartment. we see every angle. it is completely quiet and still. the camera settles at one angle on cynthia. a shadow behind her moves.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<A>__{cynthia jumps from fright.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{jesus, vic. i thought you... left.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{me? leave you all alone?}
<A>__{he pulls her into his arms. she hesitates.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{vic? vic, are you... happy?}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{that...}
<P>__{(kissing her)}
<D>__{...has to be..}
<P>__{(kissing again)}
<D>__{...the stupidest question i ever heard...}
<A>__{he keeps kissing, caressing.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i mean... with... life. with... being alive.}
<A>__{he looks at her oddly.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<P>__{(relaxing)}
<D>__{never mind... i had this... bizarre dream...}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{welcome to reality.}
<A>__{he touches her soft face. he runs his hands down her neck. they kiss again, she now completely without reservation. their embrace is so all encompassing that, when she opens her eyes, it's only then that she sees}
<B>__{closer}
<A>__{she is kissing a burned and scarred face with only clumps of puppy black muscle hanging on the bone. it is harris' face, the face we saw in the elevator. cynthia gasps, fumbles backwards off of the sofa.}
<C>__{victor }
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<A>__{she looks back up at him. he's victor again, normal again.}
<C>__{victor }
<D>__{cynthia?}
<A>__{she knocks over a tequila bottle. it's spilled all over the floor. she is speechless. he picks the bottle up.}
<C>__{victor }
<D>__{why did you pull away?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i... i think i'd better go.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{why?}
<A>__{she's over by the door. victor comes and presses against it so she can't get out.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{please let me out.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{i don't understand... what did i do?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{nothing. it's not you, it... it's me. i just want to go.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{you know, maybe you belong in that clinic, because this, this is crazy! we were having a good time }
<P>__{(on her look)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. look, what we were feeling... it was special.}
<A>__{she softens }
<C>__{victor }
<D>__{ it was unity.}
<P>__{(distantly)}
<D>__{unity, now and through eternity... cynthia, you cannot run...}
<A>__{that does it. pale, she scrabbles at the doorknob, opens it, runs out.}
<C>__{victor }
<D>__{you cannot run... you belong to us forever !}
