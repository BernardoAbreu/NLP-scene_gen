<L>__{exterior indian township day}
<A>__{ben has parked his car in a street corner of the upmarket section of the asian township. he peers around him, then walks away. ben knocks at a door. the door is opened cautiously by dr. hassiem, a tall, handsome indian, aged 35 years. his clothes are casual but expensive. his six year old daughter, large dark eyes, is clinging to his leg. we recognize the little girl of the photograph near the telephone, from earlier.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{dr. hassiem? i'm ben du toit. i'm a friend of gordon ngubene's...}
<C>__{dr. hassiem}
<P>__{(raising his hands)}
<D>__{the inquest is over, mr. du toit.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{not for me, doctor. i've got to know what happened to gordon.}
<A>__{dr. hassiem looks shaky, nervous.}
<C>__{dr. hassiem}
<D>__{i only came home yesterday. after three months in detention and now i'm banned and confined to the house. there's nothing i can do for you.}
<A>__{the little girl still clinging to his leg, watching ben.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i know it may be painful to you, doctor, but i need to talk to you.}
<C>__{dr. hassiem}
<D>__{how can i be sure you weren't actually sent by them?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{ask emily. doctor, we are in the process of filing a civil claim. and your help is vital.}
<A>__{hassiem gives ben a long look. he picks up his daughter and opens the door fully.}
<C>__{dr. hassiem}
<D>__{come in.}
<A>__{ben walks into the large living room, tastefully furnished.}
<C>__{dr. hassiem}
<D>__{sit down.}
<A>__{ben is still looking 'round at the opulence. he sits in a chair.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{thank you for inviting me in.}
<C>__{dr. hassiem}
<P>__{(the little girl on his knees)}
<D>__{what do you want to know?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{just one thing, doctor. why did you sign the state pathologist's report on the autopsy if you drew up your own report as well?}
<C>__{dr. hassiem}
<P>__{(disconcerted)}
<D>__{what makes you think i signed dr. jansen's report.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{the report produced in court had both your signatures on it.}
<C>__{dr. hassiem}
<D>__{impossible.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what did you write in your report?}
<C>__{dr. hassiem}
<D>__{dr. jansen and i didn't disagree on the facts. after all we examined the same body in the same time. but just on the interpretation. for example, if gordon, had really been hanged, the marks on his throat would have been concentrated on the front.}
<P>__{(he touches his larynx)}
<D>__{but in this case, the bruises were more obvious on the sides.}
<A>__{pause. ben nods, silent.}
<C>__{dr. hassiem}
<D>__{something else really upset me, perhaps it isn't important.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what was it?}
<A>__{dr. hassiem puts down his daughter.}
<C>__{dr. hassiem}
<P>__{(leaning forward)}
<D>__{you see, through a misunderstanding i arrived at the morgue too early for the autopsy. there wasn't a soul around except a young african attendant. when i told him i'd come for the autopsy, he let me in. the body was on the table dressed. i noticed blood on the clothes.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{and then?}
<C>__{dr. hassiem}
<D>__{as i examined the clothes more closely, a police officer came in and said i wasn't allowed in the morgue before dr. jansen arrived. when i returned with dr. jansen, half an hour later, the body was naked.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{doctor, we've already got the african attendant's affidavit. he testified that capt. stolz ordered him to burn the clothes.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{did you mention what you said in your report?}
<C>__{dr. hassiem}
<D>__{of course. i found it most odd.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{doctor hassiem would you be prepared to put that in writing?}
<A>__{dr. hassiem thinks it over for a while then:}
<C>__{dr. hassiem}
<D>__{please excuse me for a minute.}
<A>__{ben watches him leave the room, the little girl following him. he gets up from the chair, walks to the window, glances through it, then steps to look at some family photographs on the mantlepiece. amongst them a photograph of dr. hassiem before "big ben." dr. hassiem returns with a file, the daughter still following.}
<C>__{dr. hassiem}
<P>__{(opening the file)}
<D>__{this is my report. i only have one copy.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(astounded)}
<D>__{you have a copy of the report?}
<A>__{hassiem grins.}
<C>__{dr. hassiem}
<D>__{i know how to hide things from the s.b., mr. du toit.}
<A>__{ben congratulates him by a deep laughter.}
