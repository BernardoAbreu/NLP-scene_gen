<L>__{exterior truck stop day}
<A>__{jeff skids on his heels down the loose hillside and reaches the edge of the parking lot. there are trucks everywhere. diesel motors rumble. exhaust fills the air. he reaches the end of a row of big rigs, starts searching the grounds for the markings of red's 18 wheeler. it's nowhere in sight. a high pitched feminine squeal from an adjacent truck's sleeping compartment startles jeff.}

<D>__{c'mon, baby, give it up!}
<A>__{the woman giggles, o.s. jeff ignores it, scanning the truck stop. he stiffens. a police car is arriving at the truck stop. staying out of sight, jeff passes quickly to the rear of a tractor trailer.}
