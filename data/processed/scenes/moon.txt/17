<A>__{back with sam at the comms unit as he wraps up the message.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{please kiss eve for me. and tell her daddy will only be away a little longer seventeen days longer, approximately. i love you both dearly. bye.}
<A>__{and he sends the message.}

<L>__{interior corridor}
<A>__{the main corridor connecting the different rooms. we've seen everything there is to see now. the base is small. confined. claustrophobic. it is easy to imagine how someone could crack up here. sam leaves the comms room and heads down the corridor.}
<L>__{interior rec room}
<A>__{a state of the art robot, a gerty 3000 known simply as "gerty" is preparing sam's breakfast. gerty is in three sections and moves along a horizontal rail that runs throughout the base. he has a readout screen that perpetually spews data. his hands resemble pincers, but are perfectly nimble. for the purposes of helping run the base and looking after sam, gerty is as good as human, if not better. sam enters.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{morning, gerty.}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{morning, sam. how are you today?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{fine. fine. you?}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{i'm very well. how's your headache?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{much better, thanks, pal.}
<A>__{sam treats gerty more like a person than a robot. whether this is down to gerty's intelligence or sam's desperation for company isn't clear just yet. note: gerty talks like a well educated older man. his language doesn't have a great deal of inflection (i.e. monotone) but he is friendly enough. sam switches a dial on a radio but gets nothing but static he sticks in a mini cd and skips the first few tracks. we hear brief clips of talk radio and shuttle through it before he allows it to play on, on some random american station an old weather report:}
<C>__{voice on radio}
<D>__{...it's a hot one on the east coast, temperatures soaring to a high of ninety three degrees in new york city }
<A>__{they zip around the tiny kitchen, together preparing sam's breakfast, working as a team.}
