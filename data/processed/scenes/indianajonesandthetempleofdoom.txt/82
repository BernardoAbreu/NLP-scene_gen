<A>__{hundreds of lanters illuminate the garden where after dinner drinks are served, cigars lighted and hookah pipes puffed on. indiana comes out of the pavilion into the garden with capt. blumburtt and they talk quietly.}

<D>__{even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout hindu would never touch meat.}

<A>__{now, the little maharajah comes over with his retinue and he reaches for indy's whip which short round is carrying.}

<D>__{i have seen this thing. what is it, dr. jones?}
<C>__{short round}
<D>__{hey, nobody touches indy's whip!}

<D>__{you wish is my command, your highness.}
<A>__{while short round watches angrily, indiana walks across the gar den and unfurls the whip. indy sees a servant lighting a candle. suddenly the whip flies and cracks like a pistol shot. the candle disappears! indiana whirls and cracks the whip again, snagging a flower out of a dancing girl's hair. the maharajah reacts like any kid he shoops happily.}
<C>__{maharajah}
<D>__{that is wonderful! please teach me how!}
<A>__{short round sulks as he listens to indiana instructing the maha rajah on how to hold the whip. as the young prince practises the grip, indy notices chattar lal slip behind a fountain to talk to a dark figure in robes who appears. indiana sees chattar lal bow to the dark figure and indy catches a glimpse of the stranger's pale face and dark hollow eyes. then the robled apparition seems to disappear. meanwhile everyone watches respectfully as the maharajah unfurls the whip for his first attempt. he flings the whip but it flies back and snaps biting his own cheek. there's a stunned silence then short round laughs at the little prince who is holding his wounded cheek. the incensed ma rahajah suddenly flashes the whip as short round. short round grabs the end of it and pulls hard the whip is tugged taut between the two hostile boys. as they draw near each other, short round sees something weird: the little maharajah's eyes begin glowing yelloe and he hisses softly in a strange voice. nobody else sees or hears the bizarre transformation... indiana finally intercedes he grabs short round by the neck.}

<D>__{okay, short round, let go of it.}
<A>__{short round lets go and indy gently takes the whip back from the little prince.}
