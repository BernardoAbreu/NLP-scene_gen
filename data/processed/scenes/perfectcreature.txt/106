<D>__{stephanie richards, you just brought her in.}
<A>__{and then a scream. blood curdling; the sound of someone insane, screaming their lungs out, hurling abuse. we see the faces of the cops and the terrified nurse in front of them who points down the hall where the noise is coming from. the cops move off. the nurse then sees someone else arrive. she raises the pendant that hangs around her neck and kisses it.}
