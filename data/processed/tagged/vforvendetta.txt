<A>__{in the darkness, we hear a voice, a woman's voice. her name is evey.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{"remember, remember, the fifth of november, the gunpowder treason and plot. i know of now reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot."}
<A>__{her voice has a strength that is metered by a calmness, a deep centered peace that we can feel.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{those were almost the very first words he spoke to me and, in a way, that is where this story began, four hundred years ago, in a cellar beneath the houses of parliament.}
<A>__{in the darkness, we find a lantern. guy fawkes, a dangerous man who wears a goatee, is struggling with a wheelbarrow stacked with barrels of gunpowder.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{in 1605, guy fawkes attempted to blow up the houses of parliament.}
<A>__{the wheelbarrow bumps over the heavy stone mortar of the cellar floor. from the dark depths, we hear the sound of dogs.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{he was caught in the cellars with enough gunpowder to level most of london.}
<A>__{guy sees lanterns coming from both sides. he tries to run as the dogs reach him first. he grabs for his sword as dozens of pole axes pin him against the tunnel's stone wall.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{sometimes i wonder where we would be if he hadn't failed. i wonder if it would have mattered.}
<A>__{in the dim pre dawn light, guy is led to the gallows.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{i suppose the answer is in the rhyme. more than the man, what we must remember is the plot itself.}
<A>__{the coarse noose of rope is snugged up to guy's throat. he looks into the crowd until he finds a face, a woman's face, staring up at him.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{for in the plot we find more than just a man, we find the idea of that man, the spirit of that man, and that is what we must never forget.}
<A>__{the lever is thrown and the woman looks down, a tear falling down her face.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{this, then, is the story of that idea, of that spirit that began with an anarchist's plot four hundred years ago.}
<A>__{guy's body hangs in silhouette, lifeless against a red morning sun.}

<A>__{a young evey sits on her father's lap, combing her barbie's hair.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{i was born near the end of the millennium, the year 1997. my father used to say that people were so afraid that the world was going to end that they were willing it to happen.}
<A>__{her father sits beside her mother on the living room couch, watching the news. from the look on their faces, the news is bad.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{i don't remember much of the century's turn. i don't remember the market crash or the plague or any of the trafalgar riots.}
<A>__{the television flickers with images of heavily armed soldiers fighting in a shelled city.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{i've read about them since but i don't recall how any of them impacted my life except for the fear. they would hide it from me, like a secret between them.}
<A>__{little evey sees her father staring at her mother. they take hold of each other's hand, clasping them tight.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{but i could feel it.}
<L>__{exterior city street}
<A>__{it is a new day. people are gathered along the street as if they were waiting for a parade.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{of the chaos that seemed to swallow the beginning of the 21st century, there is one thing i do remember.}
<A>__{evey holds her father's hand. unable to see what is coming, she can hear it.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{very clearly, i can remember that sound.}
<A>__{we hear them, hundreds of marching soldiers.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{and i remember those boots, black leather that gleamed bright in the morning sun. i had never seen such boots. all moving in perfect unison.}
<A>__{little evey hides in the forest of adults, clinging to her father's leg, staring as row after row of boots march by with military precision.}
<L>__{exterior city street}
<A>__{in the midst of a political rally for the emerging new party calling itself norsefire, we find little evey now on her father's shoulders. dascombe, a young man, paces the podium, inciting the crowd.}
<C>__{dascombe}
<D>__{the time has come, london, to return to a bygone age, an age of tradition, an age of values that have been disparaged and all but forgotten. what this country needs is a leader! a true leader to remind us of that age. a righteous leader with the strength of his moral convictions to do what must be done. i give you that man! i give you our leader! adam susan!}
<A>__{adam susan rises and the crowd cheers. evey's father looks at her mother and again they clasp hands.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{it must have seemed so easy to them. they offered such a simple deal; give up control and we will restore order.}
<L>__{interior suburban house}
<A>__{little evey is asleep in her bedroom.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{at first, the arrests were political. dissidents. radicals. liberals.}
<A>__{a loud crash of splintering wood wakes her up.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{when my parents were younger, they had been activists. they had marched with labor in the great train strike.}
<A>__{the sound of heavy boots swarms through the house.}
<C>__{little evey}
<D>__{mommy?}
<A>__{her bedroom door bursts open and a heavily armed soldier scoops her up. she is carried through the dark house which is filled with soldiers. on the floor of the living room, she sees her parents being bound with plastic zip ties.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{my daughter! don't take my daughter!}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{evey! evey!}
<C>__{little evey}
<D>__{mommy! daddy!}
<A>__{a heavy black hood is pulled over each of her parent's heads as evey is carried out of the house.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{i never saw them again. overnight, my life, my entire world was erased.}
<L>__{interior bathroom}
<A>__{a nun with a switch in her crossed arms watches as evey and several other little girls scrub the floor of a dormitory bathroom.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{it was done so quickly and violently, so completely, that it began to seem that it had never even existed.}
<A>__{a tear rolls down little evey's cheek.}
<L>__{exterior house}
<A>__{a gay man is dragged violently from his piccadilly home. outside, he sees his lover being forced to the cobblestones.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{the homosexuals were nexterior what god had started with aids had to be finished by man. it was god's work. that's what we were told.}
<A>__{he reaches for him as the clubs rise and fall, vicious and bloody.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{but once they were gone, there was someone else. someone different.}
<A>__{in another neighborhood, we see the police arresting pakistanis.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{someone dangerous.}
<A>__{in a different area, young black men are packed into a caged van so tightly they are unable to move.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{there were those who understood what was happening, who knew it was wrong but who kept silent.}
<A>__{a young detective named finch looks down as the van pulls away. when he looks up, another man in a military uniform whose name is almond is watching him.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{and in the vacuum of that silence, order was imposed.}
<A>__{finch sticks his pipe in his mouth and turns away.}
<L>__{exterior street}
<A>__{again, we see the marching boots.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{order that was like those boots, order that required rigorous discipline. order that is exactly the same, where each single step falls with every step. the order of the many shaped into one.}
<A>__{we move through the columns of marching soldiers to a wall where a poster has been plastered up. the poster reads, "strength through purity, purity through faith."}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{somehow in my heart, i knew it wouldn't last.}
<A>__{as the sound of the marching fades, a shadow falls over the sign. after a moment, we hear the hiss of spray painterior}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{what they thought they had crushed, the spirit they believed trampled and ground beneath the marching of their boots, rose up, rose as if from a four hundred year old grave, rose to remind us all that day.}
<A>__{the shadow sprays a "v" over the poster.}

<A>__{close on a loudspeaker. there is one on every major street corner.}
<C>__{fate }
<D>__{good evening, london. it's nine o'clock, the fourth of november in the year 2019 and this is the voice of fate broadcasting on 275 and 285 of the medium wave.}
<A>__{beneath the loudspeaker is a surveillance system labeled, "for your protection." bubble eyed lenses iris at the end of stalks that move, insect like, racheting and clicking as they watch a little girl pedal her bicycle. the little girl glances nervously over her shoulder up at the mechanical eyes watching her.}

<D>__{people of london, be advised }
<L>__{exterior evey's apartment}
<A>__{there is a radio on a small makeup table.}
<C>__{fate }
<D>__{ that braxton and streathon are quarantine zones as of today.}
<A>__{evey is now a young woman. she slips into a dress that is little more than a nightgown. she tries to adjust it, pulling it down at the hem, pulling it up at the thin shoulder straps, but it is like trying to hide behind a lamppost.}
<C>__{fate }
<D>__{it is suggested that these area be avoided for reasons of health and safety.}

<D>__{good news following the productivity reports from herefordshire indicating a possible end to meat rationing starting mid february.}

<A>__{she packs tissue paper into the toes of a pair of high heels that are too big for her.}
<C>__{fate }
<D>__{police raided seventeen homes in the birmingham area, uncovering what is believed to be a major terrorist ring.}
<L>__{interior shadow gallery}
<A>__{we move over a dressing bureau, past a wig and over a pair of black leather gloves, moving until we find the mask; it is like something from the masquerade ball of another era. it has an exaggerated goatee, harlequin cheeks and a smile, forever fixed, at once be guiling and be deviling.}
<C>__{fate }
<D>__{twenty eight people, eight of them women, are currently in detention awaiting trial.}
<L>__{interior evey's apartment}
<A>__{evey coats her lips with a lascivious red. she stares into the mirror, her makeup like a mask over her own face.}
<C>__{fate }
<D>__{and that is the face of london tonight.}
<L>__{interior shadow gallery}
<A>__{the man, now fully dressed in cloak, hat, and mask gazes into the mirror. this is v.}
<C>__{fate }
<D>__{and this is the voice of fate signing off and bidding you a pleasant evening.}
<L>__{exterior city street}
<A>__{close on evey's high heels, stumbling and awkward as she walks down a dark cobblestoned street.}
<L>__{exterior city street}
<A>__{close on v's boots walking in the opposite direction so that it seems they are walking towards each other.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{i don't know what brought us together that night. i had never been to that part of westminster but ever since i've known him, i've stopped believing in coincidence.}
<L>__{exterior city street}
<A>__{evey looks up and sees a man standing mostly in shadow.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{excuse me? uh... excuse me, mister?}
<A>__{the man turns around. it is not v.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{would you like... uh, would you like to sleep with me?}
<A>__{he smiles.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{i mean, for money.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{that is the clumsiest bit of propositioning i've ever heard.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{oh god, i'm sorry.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{is this your first time, darling?}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{yes, no, i mean for money. but i know what you want and i will do it.}
<A>__{she presses her body to his, using her little girl eyes and her woman's mouth.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{anything you want, mister. please, i need the money. i know i'm young but i promise i know what i'm doing.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{no. you don't know what you're doing.}
<A>__{he pulls out his wallet and shows her a badge. the sight of it knocks the breath out of her.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{christ, you're a fingerman.}
<C>__{fingerman 1}
<D>__{give the little lady a prize.}
<C>__{fingerman 2}
<D>__{i've got something to give her.}
<A>__{evey turns and there are more fingermen behind her.}
<C>__{fingerman 1}
<D>__{prostitution is a class h offense. know what that means? it means that we get to exercise our own judicial discretion }
<C>__{fingerman 2}
<D>__{and you get to swallow it.}
<A>__{the fingermen laugh.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{oh god, please. it's my first time. please don't hurt me.}
<C>__{fingerman 1}
<D>__{gosh, fellas, look at those big innocent eyes. what do you think?}
<C>__{fingerman 3}
<D>__{spare the rod, spoil the child.}
<A>__{fingerman 2 laughs hard as he drops his pants.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{oh no!}
<A>__{he shoves her face first against a brick wall, lifting her dress to expose her bottom.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{please, don't!}
<C>__{fingerman 3}
<D>__{you heard the man, sweetie. this rod's for your own good.}
<A>__{suddenly, they are no longer alone.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{"the multiplying villainies of nature do swarm upon him."}
<C>__{fingerman 3}
<D>__{what the hell }
<C>__{v}
<D>__{"and fortune, on his damned quarrel, smiling, showed like a rebel's whore."}
<C>__{fingerman 1}
<D>__{we're police officers, pal.}
<C>__{fingerman 4}
<D>__{we're with the finger.}
<C>__{fingerman 3}
<D>__{so bugger off!}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{"disdaining fortune with his brandished steel, which smoked with bloody execution."}
<A>__{in the clenched fist of black leather, we see a flash of steel.}
<C>__{fingerman 1}
<D>__{he's got a knife!}
<A>__{v attacks and at once we know this is no normal human being. a single blow sends the largest of the fingermen flying backwards. but more than his strength, it is his speed. a gun is cocked but before the hammer falls, a knife is buried in the fingerman's chest and before the body falls, the knife is gone. it takes a handful of seconds and three bodies lay on the ground. v turns to the last fingerman who is struggling to pull his pants up.}
<C>__{fingerman 3}
<D>__{jesus christ! don't hurt me!}
<A>__{v steps forward and he screams, bolting while holding his pants up.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{good evening.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{who who are you?}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{me? i imagine all manner of names shall be heaped upon my humble visage but, for now, let us simply say i am the villain.}
<A>__{he throws wide his cloak and bows deeply to her.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{and you would be?}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{evey.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{they hear sirens rushing towards them. in a blink, he scoops her up and dashes into the shadows of a narrow alleyway.}
<L>__{exterior rooftops}
<A>__{police cars and several ambulances swarm over the area with the dead fingermen. v watches them from above.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{why did you do that? why did you... help me?}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{why indeed?}
<A>__{he takes out an old antique pocket watch. it is almost midnight.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{almost time.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{for the music.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{music?}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{yes, music. my music. you see. evey, i am a performer.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{is that why you're wearing a mask?}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{we all wear masks. life creates them and forces us to find the one that fits. do you know what day it is?}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{uh... november fourth.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{not for long.}
<A>__{he looks out where, rising above the rooftops, he can see big ben.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{"remember, remember, the fifth of november, the gunpowder treason and plot. i know of no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot."}
<A>__{the second hand sweeps into the final minute.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{tell me, evey, what good is an actor that plays his part to an empty theatre?}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{nor do i. that's why you are here. i need you, evey. i need someone to listen.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{to your music?}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{yes. yes, to my music.}
<A>__{from his sleeve, he pulls a conductor's wand.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{can you hear it? it's already begun.}
<A>__{he begins to lightly tap the wand in the air and, very faintly, we hear it.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{i can't hear anything.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{at first, you have to listen very carefully...}
<A>__{he continues to conduct and we begin to hear the music, violins and horns that seem almost like a whisper or a wind that steadily swells.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{ahh, yes. there it is. beautiful, is it not?}
<A>__{he turns to the parapet, his gestures growing grander as the music rises and we recognize tchaikovsky's 1812 overture. the music mounts a climax and v points the wand at big ben as cymbals crash big ben explodes with such force the world seems to shake, while v, smiling, always smiling, points again with another crescendo and the statue of justice is blown to smithereens. v nods in appreciation while mustering the music towards it's finale as fireworks begin lighting up the sky.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{oh my...}
<A>__{everywhere across the city, people stand transfixed by the dazzling shimmer of the fireworks until a strobing final blitz leaves a single, starry image floating in the smoke filled sky. it is the letter v.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{it's beautiful...}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{from every direction, the city screams with the panicked sound of sirens.}
<L>__{exterior new government building}
<A>__{a massive modern building that is the seat of the new government. a long, black car pulls up to the entrance. adam susan gets out, wearing a long black trenchcoat over his pajamas. he is the leader and he looks older, heavier, and meaner. he hurries past the heavily armed guards, barely acknowledging the snap and cock of their nazi like salute.}
<L>__{interior leader's office}
<A>__{the leader enters his main chambers and we see the fate computer system. it is a cerebral cortex for a vast intelligence network. information can almost be felt coursing through its hard drives. the leader sits, at once regaining a measure of composure. he takes a deep calming breath and accesses the system. dozens of monitors fill with images from all across the city, most of them are of the damage caused by v.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{gentlemen, i will hear your reports now. mr. heyer, speak for the eye.}
<A>__{conrad heyer appears on one of the screens. he is at his desk inside the command center for the eye, the governmental organization responsible for the visual surveillance systems.}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{we have less than two minutes of usable footage, leader. it took the suspect less than a minute to dispatch the finger's vice patrol.}
<A>__{on an insert screen, we see grainy footage of v rescuing evey from one of the pole mounted cameras.}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{as you can see, the suspect's reflex speed is extraordinary. as is his strength.}
<A>__{as the last body falls, v seems to pause and looks back over his shoulder straight into the camera.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{freeze it!}
<A>__{the leader stares at the smiling face.}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{i'm afraid the mask makes retinal identification impossible.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{mr. etheridge, report for the ear!}
<A>__{bunny etheridge appears on another screen. behind him, huge spooling reels of audiotape wind constantly.}
<C>__{etheridge}
<D>__{we were able to triangulate the origin of the fireworks. we also are currently monitoring a lot of phone surveillance indicating a high percentage of conversation concerned with the explosions. all suspect or significant transcripts are being forwarded to mr. almond.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{very good. mr. finch, speak for the nose.}
<A>__{finch, no longer the same young man, stands at the site of the fireworks launch.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{thanks to etheridge, we found the launch for the fireworks. these appear to be individually weighted flares and we have found traces of the same chemicals at both of the detonation sites which leads us to conclude that, despite a level of sophistication, these devices are all home made with over the counter chemicals, making them impossible to trace. whoever he is, leader, he's good.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{thank you for that professional annotation.}
<A>__{an intercom opens.}
<C>__{lieutenant }
<D>__{leader, mr. almond has arrived.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{very good. gentlemen, keep me informed of any further developments. england prevails.}
<A>__{they answer in unison as almond enters the office. his face is harder but he has the same violent gleam in his eye. the leader turns in his chair.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{mr. almond, do you know what this is behind me?}
<C>__{almond}
<D>__{uh... the fate computer system, sir?}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{no. no sir. it's more than that. this, this computer is a symbol, mr. almond. a symbol of the highest attainable goal of mankind. do you know what that goal is, mr. almond?}
<A>__{almond does not. the leader leaps from his chair while pounding the desk.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{control, mr. almond! control! the world around us is a changing, directionless, amoral morass and it is up to man and man alone to set things right!}
<A>__{he moves around the desk at almond.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{without control, man is nothing more than any other stinking, sweating, brute animal. control, mr. almond. the control that we have painstakingly built up over the last ten years. now, do you understand what happened last night?}
<C>__{almond}
<D>__{we... lost control.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{yes, mr. almond. last night someone did the unthinkable. someone hurt us. it is imperative that we act swiftly and precisely. i want that man found, mr. almond. i want his head or, by god, i will have yours.}

<D>__{no. but i don't have to.}
<A>__{almost casually, v bends down to pick up the knife the leader screams and fires. bullets knock v back a bit but he continues, grabbing the knife and standing. eyes widening with disbelief, the leader fires another blast as v begins walking towards him. the machine gun roars, bullets shredding out through the back of v's cloak as he continues with short deliberate steps until the hammer clicks against the pin. the gun is empty. v stands before him.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{you see? you cannot kill me. there is no flesh and blood within this cloak to kill. there is only an idea.}
