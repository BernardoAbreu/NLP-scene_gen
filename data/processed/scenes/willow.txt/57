<L>__{exterior deserted fishing village day}
<A>__{half a dozen decrepit huts sit rotting on the edge of the lake. there are no inhabitants, just a lot of dis carded junk, including a few battered fishing boats. but madmartigan, keeping one eye on the gold tree out on the island, is undaunted. he rummages through the debris, hauling out a fishing boat and shouldering it toward the water.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{give me a hand here, peck!}
<A>__{willow hoists the baby into the papoose and helps mad martigan.}

<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{it's nothing to do with you.}
<A>__{but the boy looks innocent and harmless, and willow ap proaches him.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{we need to get out to that island.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{the island is cursed.}
<A>__{madmartigan scoffs at this nonsense, grunting and push ing the boat into the water.}

<D>__{ahh, he's trying to protect the gold. come on, willow. jump in.}
<A>__{madmartigan climbs into the boat and grabs an oar, eager to go. willow looks down at the brownies for help.}
<C>__{willow}
