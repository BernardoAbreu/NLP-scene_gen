<C>__{ancient sorter}
<D>__{it's a blue letter... top, top level... confidential communication between the brass... usually bad news... they hate blue letters upstairs... hate 'em!}
<A>__{norville gulps.}
<C>__{hutchinson}
<D>__{you!}
<A>__{norville looks over his shoulder, but the ancient sorter has disappeared.}
<C>__{hutchinson}
<D>__{...yeah, you! barnes!}
