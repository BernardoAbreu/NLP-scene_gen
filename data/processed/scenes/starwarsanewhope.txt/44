<L>__{exterior tatooine sand pit rock mesa day}
<A>__{little artoo stands at the edge of a large sand pit and begins to chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps. luke and ben stand over a very dented and tangled threepio lying half buried in the sand. one of his arms has broken off. luke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and then flips a hidden switch on his back several times until finally the mechanical man's systems turn on.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{where am i? i must have taken a bad step...}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{can you stand? we've got to get out of here before the sandpeople return.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{i don't think i can make it. you go on, master luke. there's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. i'm done for.}
<A>__{artoo makes a beeping sound.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no, you're not. what kind of talk is that?}
<A>__{luke and ben help the battered robot to his feet. little artoo watches from the top of the pit. ben glances around suspiciously. sensing something, he stands up and sniffs the air.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{quickly, son... they're on the move.}
