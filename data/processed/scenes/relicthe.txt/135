<A>__{jonathan crouches in the staircase at the end of the hall of the reptiles. hobbes is still by his side. he keeps the gun pointed out into the room, his eyes scanning the dark. he whispers to hobbes, as if to comfort both of them.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{it's okay, hobbes. we'll be all right. help has got to come eventually... we'll make it. we'll be fine.}
<A>__{suddenly he sees something. what appears to be a body lying on a glass case! jonathan pumps his gun, approaches slowly. the man wears a tuxedo, is lying very still. as we get closer we see it's the drunk kawakita ran into in the stairwell so long ago! he suddenly hiccups. jonathan starts. now the man gently snores. jonathan moves to him, shakes the drunk's shoulder.}

<A>__{hobbes has started to wag his tail and tug at the leash to draw jonathan's attention.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{what is it, boy?}
<A>__{from above comes the beating of a distant helicopter and then the sound of breaking glass. hobbes pulls jonathan back to the staircase. jonathan grins, follows behind with the drunk.}
