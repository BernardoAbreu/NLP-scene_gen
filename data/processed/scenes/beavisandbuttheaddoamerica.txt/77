<C>__{flemming}
<D>__{you see what i see, bork?}
<C>__{bork}
<D>__{i see it. i don't get it.}
<C>__{flemming}
<D>__{you got half the state looking for ya how do you get away?}

<A>__{on monitor. the device that was put in back of beavis' pants.}
<C>__{bork }

<D>__{it gets worse. the unit wasn't finished. it has a flaw the casing. if hit hard enough, it could break open, releasing the virus.}
<A>__{a murmuring through the room. flemming rises and holds up a picture of b&b.}
