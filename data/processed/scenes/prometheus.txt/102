<L>__{interior juggernaut egg chamber}
<A>__{watts awakens. her helmet is gone. david is dragging her across the floor into a huge cargo hold full of alien eggs. the wide trench holding hundreds of eggs under a membrane of light: an evolution of the molluscoids watts saw before. armored, hardened, darker.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{david. what are you doing?}
<A>__{he hauls her upright to let her look across the huge space. his grip looks casual but it might as well be iron manacles.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{juggernaut, the chariot of krishna, was also a bringer of death. crushing his worshippers under its wheels.}
<A>__{he drags watts down into the trench. breaking the membrane of light. grips her against his chest like a doll with one arm.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{this ship has seven other cargo bays like this one. the eggs in each bay slightly different. they've been weaponized.}
<A>__{watts struggles to free herself. david's arm is inescapable.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{i've seen the juggernaut's flight plan. its destination was earth. seventeen hundred years ago. this was the ship that never came. this was its cargo.}
<A>__{david caresses an alien egg. it opens under his touch fleshy petals folding wetly back. watts twists frantically in his grip. wild eyed.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{stop!}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{perfect predators. designed to kill human beings. that's what the engineers were bringing to earth. this was a death ship.}
<A>__{a facehugger emerges from the egg, its grotesque fingers clawing at the air. this is not the boneless squid that attacked holloway; this is a pale skeletal hand, armored. david strokes it curiously: the thing ignores his touch. climbs watts's body.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{i'm not what it wants. but you, with your warm wet breath...it knows you.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{david. no. no.}
<A>__{the facehugger scuttles toward her face. watts shrieks. david grabs it nonchalantly by the tail. dangles it in front of their faces, studying it.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{the engineers did their work too well. and on this waystation moon, the weapon they made destroyed them.}
<A>__{watts shudders, staring at the thing. for a moment the grander horror eclipses her own peril.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{why would they make such things?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{to destroy their wayward children.}
<P>__{(intoning)}
<D>__{"and the lord said, i will destroy man whom i have created from the face of the earth...for it repenteth me that i have made them." genesis six seven.}
<A>__{he regards watts with something almost like pity.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{i know. i met my creators the day i was born. i was disappointed too.}
<A>__{he lets the facehugger go. watts twists her face away as the long fingers close around her head. clenches her teeth against the vile proboscis thrusting at her mouth. her heels hammer the deck.}
<C>__{david }
<P>__{(whispering to her)}
<D>__{extraordinary.}
<A>__{the scaly tail throttles her. her mouth opens. the proboscis plunges home. the facehugger seats itself. watts collapses in david's arms, a faceless rag doll. her blasphemous passenger secure in its place.}
