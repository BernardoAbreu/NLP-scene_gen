<L>__{interior grace's bedroom bathroom day}
<A>__{bobby, his hand rebandaged, is putting on his clothes.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{you're still lucky.}
<A>__{as he does he looks at himself in the mirror. he bends to pick up his shirt which is draped over the gym bag. as he lifts it we can see, perhaps more closely than at the garage, that the bag is}
<L>__{3 4 filled with money. he closes the bag and stands. in the}
<A>__{mirror, hidden in the doorway, he sees grace watching him. bobby slows perceptibly, but does not try to hide himself. after a moment grace walks into the room carrying a glass of lemonade.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{thought you might like a refill on your lemonade.}
<A>__{bobby takes the lemonade and drinks it down. he rubs the glass against his forehead.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{that's good. cools you right off.}
<P>__{(tentatively) i saw you watching me.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i didn't mean to.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i didn't say it bothered me.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{did you like it; me watching you?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i guess. i've got an ego same as any man.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{good, 'cause i liked what i saw.}
<A>__{bobby gives a smile as devilish as it is pleasant. grace slides an ice cube from the glass between her lips. he notices a framed picture of grace and an older man.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{nice place.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{grace sits on the edge of the bed. bobby indicates the picture, ironic.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{who's that, your father?}
<C>__{grace }
<D>__{stepfather...}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{got a boyfriend?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{no. not really.}
<A>__{bobby senses she's lying but plays along.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i guess it must.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what do you do anyway?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{a little of this, a little of that. mostly i tell fortunes.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{where'd you learn to do that?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{from my father. he was the tribe's shaman.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{a medicine man?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{those are white words, not ours.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{nice house for a shaman's daughter. you must be good.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{come here.}
<A>__{bobby goes to grace and kneels before her. she takes his head in her hands and looks deep into his eyes. her voice goes thick, but soft, like a morning fog.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{there's something in your past; something you want to keep hidden. there's a pain. something ... someone you can't forget. and there is something you want very badly. it seems very far away to you, but you are determined, and you will do what you must to get it.}
<A>__{bobby closes his hands on grace's and takes them from his face. he is more than slightly spooked by the accuracy of grace's reading.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{my face tell you all that?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{it tells me what every face tells me. everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.}
<P>__{(seductively) what is it you want?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{the same thing you do.}
<A>__{they silently stare into each other's eyes.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{really? i want to hang drapes.}
<A>__{grace walks from the room. for a moment bobby stares after her. he takes an ice cube from his glass and crunches it in his teeth.}
