<L>__{interior o'reilly house roderick's bedroom early morning}
<A>__{roderick enters.}
<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{into a pretty nest of villains, indeed, was i plunged! when i returned to my bed chamber, a few hours later, it seemed as if all my misfortunes were to break on me at once.}
<A>__{valise open, wardrobe lying on the ground, and roderick's keys in the possession of o'reilly and his wife.}
<C>__{captain o'reilly}
<D>__{whom have i been harboring in my house? who are you, sirrah?}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{sirrah! sirrah, i am as good a gentleman as any in ireland!}
<C>__{captain o'reilly}
<D>__{you're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{repeat the words again, and i run you through the body.}
<C>__{captain o'reilly}
<D>__{tut, tut! i can play at fencing as well as you, mr. roderick james. ah! you change color, do you? your secret is known, is it? you come like a viper into the bosom of innocent families; you represent yourself as the heir to my friends the o'higgins of castle o'higgins; i introduce you to the nobility and gentry of this methropolis; i take you to my tradesmen, who give you credit. i accept your note for near two hundred pounds, and what do i find? a fraud.}
<A>__{he holds up the name, roderick james, printed on the linen.}
<C>__{captain o'reilly}
<D>__{not master o'higgins of watertown, but roderick james of the devil only knows where...}
<A>__{captain o'reilly gathers up the linen clothes, silver toilet articles, and the rest of roderick's gear.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{hark ye, mr. o'reilly, i will tell you why i was obliged to alter my name, which is james and the best name in ireland. i changed it, sir, because, on the day before i came to dublin, i killed a man in deadly combat an englishman, sir, and a captain in his majesty's service; and if you offer to let or hinder me in the slightest way, the same arm which destroyed him is ready to punish you.}
<A>__{so saying, roderick draws his sword like lightning, and giving a "ha, ha!" and a stamp with his foot, lunges it within an inch of o'reilly's heart, who starts back and turns deadly pale, while his wife, with a scream, flings herself between them.}
<C>__{mrs. o'reilly}
<D>__{dearest roderick be pacified. o'reilly, you don't want the poor child's blood. let him escape in heaven's name, let him go.}
<C>__{captain o'reilly}
<P>__{(sulkily)}
<D>__{he may go hang for me, and he's better be off quickly, for i shall go to the magistrate if i see him again.}
<A>__{o'reilly exits. his wife sits down on the bed and begins to cry.}
