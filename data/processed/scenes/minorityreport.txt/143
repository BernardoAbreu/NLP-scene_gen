<A>__{anderson enters the room again, out of breath, some small cuts on his face and hands. he stands across the room staring at rose. rose considers him. when she speaks her voice is near and distant at the same time. for anderson, it is as if the words are coming from a place inside his own head.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{it was impossible to save that boy but you did, anderson. it's in you. it's what you are .}

<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{rose. ed witwer he's in the most trouble of all. who saves him ?}
<A>__{rose suddenly grimaces in pain, and grips the side of her head. she curls into a fetal position. anderson goes to her, touches her thin shoulder. her eyes roll into the back of her head. whose pain is she feeling? her own? someone else's? anderson doesn't want to think about it.}
