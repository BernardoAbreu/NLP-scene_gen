<D>__{clem, no! this can't keep happening. please! oh, fuck! please!}
<A>__{crazily, joel runs off, passing through a series of decayed scenes: he and clementine arguing in a car, having sex on the beach, laughing and holding hands at a movie, eating grilled cheese and tomato soup together in bed, joel watching her sleep, them drinking at a bar. he arrives at a decayed version of his first meeting with mierzwiak.}
