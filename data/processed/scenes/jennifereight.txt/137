<L>__{136: interior interrogation room. police station. day.}
<A>__{st anne lights a cigarette. attention with his notes. sniffing a fair bit. he's acquired a toilet roll to deal with it. occas ionally will tear a sheet or two off to blow his nose. glances at berlin "you want a cigarette?" no he doesn't "i've given up."}
<D>__{st anne you have? .. how about the booze? ..}
<A>__{how does st anne know? perhaps he doesn't? sounds like he does.}
<D>__{too much booze can be very dangerous .. memory black outs .. stuff like that ..}
<A>__{his attention still with notes like a quack about to prescribe.}
<D>__{"the man takes a drink, then the drink takes a drink, then the drink takes the man?" .. something like that, isn't it? .. anyway .. why did you give up?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i guess i was drinking too much. st anne i was talking about "cigarettes?"}
<P>__{(score: 10 outta 10)}
<D>__{find yourself getting breathless?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{sure. st anne specially if you're running? which floor did the elevator run up to?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{five. st anne you ran up to the fifth? you must have been real breathless by then?}
<A>__{berlin doesn't know where this is going but he doesn't like it. eyes to berlin now and his smile looks real for the first time.}
<D>__{we're gonna get our "observer" in here this afternoon. keep an eye on us? (he smiles) notorious for withholding information, the f.b.i.}
<A>__{st anne makes a note. junks the pencil. sits back in his chair.}
<D>__{were you aware there was a janit or in the institute that night?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{no. st anne you didn't check?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{there wasn't time ... st anne that wasn't my question?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{no, sir, i didn't check.}
<A>__{st anne breaks off to blow his nose. berlin looks very worried.}
<D>__{st anne i'm really catching cold up here? must be all this fog?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{what's the relevance of the janitor? st anne the janitor? let me just ask you a question before i forget do you take any medication for that?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{for what? st anne breathlessness?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{no. st anne alright, let me answer your question? "what's the relevance of the janitor?"}
<A>__{hits the cigarette like this is the one that caused the cancer.}
<D>__{why don't i take you through it, from where i'm sitting .. at some time bet ween 2 & 2:30 a.m. the janitor thought he heard a vehicle approaching through the woods. he looks out, and sees noth ing, no lights, nothing. figures it must be hunters. some time later, he thought he heard something else, like a door, or a window slam? he gets up, and between half past two and a quarter of three, he makes a search with a flashlight of the top 3 floors. finds nothing untoward, & goes back to his apartment in the roof.}
<A>__{berlin looks grey as sick. knows what's coming. and here it is.}
<D>__{the flashlight you saw, was his. the "footsteps" you heard, were his. the elevator you were chasing up and down after was empty, and is prone to such activity, due to an electrical fault .. apparently it happens frequently dur ing gales. the gale that was swinging the door. that knocked you down. that confused you so much? and here we are, back to where i'm sitting. you wanna tell me what really went on that night?}
<A>__{it seems st anne has effectively destroyed the "serial killer" scenario. stubs his cigarette and waits for berlin's response.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{two people know i didn't kill him, mr st anne. one's me, and the other's the man that did. st anne what man?}
<A>__{st anne is winning. and they both know it. and he almost grins.}
<D>__{we just dealt with "the man?"}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{how d'you know the jan itor didn't shoot him?}
<A>__{if st anne can raise an eyebrow he does. by implication berlin is ditching his "killer." during this st anne rewinds his sony.}
<D>__{you're telling me it's his flashlight i saw, ok., he sees my flashlight? and i'm coming up the stairs with a beretta in my hand. and he's frightened. he hits the door on me. picks up my gun. he's running. he runs into ross, and in panic, he shoots him.}
<A>__{the little sony snaps to a stop and st anne looks at his watch.}
<D>__{st anne not unless he had a gun in one hand, and a phone in the other, he didn't. ross was shot at ex actly two fifty seven a.m. the janitor put a call through to the local police, at 2:57 a.m. you obviously realize how i can get so accurate with my timing?}
<A>__{st anne backs off and carefully replaces the sony on the table.}
<D>__{ross switched into channel 8, & we got a recording of the whole incident. i was gonna play it to you, but i got a meeting, we'll have to do it after lunch. it's one, let's make it back by three?}
