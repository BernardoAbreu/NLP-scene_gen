<L>__{interior cab}
<A>__{rath studies bain. there is a thin line of blood down his temple. bain is oblivious to it and pulls out his gameboy, resuming his game of tetris.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{how'd you cut yourself?}
<A>__{their voices are distorted through the small electric amplifier set in the bullet proof glass near the metal money exchanger. bain touches the blood on his forehead, looking at it a bit surprised.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{oh? working. a little accident.}
<A>__{he wipes it off as best he can.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{you a waiter? you look like a waiter.}
<A>__{bain is uninterested.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{yeah. yeah, i'm a waiter.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{what restaurant?}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{uh, fontella's}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{so you're from around here?}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{no. no i'm not.}
<A>__{bain is getting agitated.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{where you from?}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{not too good at small talk, eh?}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{look, i'm real tired and i'm not interested in fucking chit chat.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i know just what you mean. i'm pretty beat myself.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{since you looked like a waiter, i had to ask what restaurant because of what happened at the trattoria roma.}
<A>__{bain looks up.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{why? what happened?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{didn't you here all them sirens? it's been all over the radio. some guy shot leevio valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the trattoria roma.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{no shit.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{yeah, it's terrible. i mean valli, and i don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook. he probably had it coming, but all the other people. real sad.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{but they caught the guy. i heard it all. sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco. shooting anybody. drugs, probably.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{probably.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i'd love to sit in that jury. send that s.o.b. right to the chair.}
<A>__{bain allows himself a bemused smile.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{sizzle lean.}
<A>__{the cab passes the intersection for the airport. bain sits up.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{that was peterson back there. that goes to the expressway for the airport.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{you're right. talking too much again.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{what? you think i'm running you up?}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{just do your job.}
<A>__{rath pulls over and slaps the cab in park.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{get out. you think i'm running you up? get out.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{you can't }
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{the hell i can't. it's my cab. i don't like you. so, get the hell out!}
<A>__{bain can't figure out what is wrong, when he sees the dashboard and the missing id. their eyes meet in the rearview mirror.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{holy fucking shit!}
<A>__{the cab rocks as both men move. instantly guns fill their hands. bain ripping out a .357 lifted from one of the dead cops. rath rolls to the side whipping the gun free from his jacket. bain throws open the door, about to run, but stops. he looks at rath. he wants him to run. anyone who moves away from the bullet proof glass is dead. both men are silent, each holding the other in their gun sights. bain blinks, sweat forming on his lip.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{i get out, you got me.}
<A>__{bain reaches over and closes the door. he smiles knowing it is the right move.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{now what?}
<A>__{rath calmly uncocks his gun.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{we're both going to the airport.}
<A>__{bain nods.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{sit back. put your seatbelt on.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{no fucking way.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{okay, don't.}
<A>__{bain thinks.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{if either of us fucks around, the other can blow the fuel line.}
<A>__{he points his gun at the floor where the fuel line runs. bain sits back, aiming his gun, watching rath. rath eases back into the driver's seat, also holding his gun on the fuel line. he puts the car into drive and slides back into traffic, turning back towards peterson. they sit in silence, studying each other, when they hit the expressway. bain can't contain himself, giddy on adrenaline.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{jesus i'm being driven to the airport by robert rath.}
<A>__{he laughs.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{i can't believe this. you rolled some cabby for the radio, then waited for an airport fare.}
<A>__{he laughs again.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{boy, that's fucking genius. you're a fucking genius. then you're just sitting there, bullshitting with me. man, no way i coulda done that!}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{what's your name? we both know it's not nicholai.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{holy shit! robert rath wants to know my name.}
<A>__{he leans back. this is a big moment for him.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{bain. michael bain.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{how long have you been freelance?}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{two years. two long fucking years.}
<A>__{something occurs to him and he leans close to the window.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{hey. what i don't get was why didn't you take the shot inside the restaurant? i mean you had me, a free shot. that's what i would have done.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{it's just a shoot out then. sixty forty, at best. not my odds.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{sounds like chickenshit }
<A>__{he laughs hard.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{listen to me calling you chickenshit!}
<A>__{he stops laughing and looks closely at the back of rath's head.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{is that a wig? shit, i hate wigs! wigs are the worst part of this job. i'd rather dye my hair than wear a wig.}
<A>__{rath studies him.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{you're wearing a wig now.}
<A>__{bain chokes on his laugh.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{god damn are you good. everyone says you're so fucking good. i just can't believe i'm still alive. if i believed in god, i'd be down on my knees. right now hey, how come you just didn't plug us all when we came through the door?}
<A>__{rath does not answer. bain smiles. he knows something about rath now; he doesn't like killing innocent people.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{shit if i was you, back there }
<A>__{he holds his gun up to the bulletproof glass behind rath's head.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{game over.}
<A>__{he laughs.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{do you mind if i ask you a couple of business questions? you know i was wondering how much you bid this job at?}
<A>__{rath says nothing.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{you don't have to tell me that. it's just, i know my bid was low, but was it too low? i mean, did i seem like an amateur, like i didn't know what i was doing?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{we both know what you were doing.}
<A>__{bain moves close to the glass again, checking out rath's gun.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{smith and wesson .22 with an eight inch silencer. classic. when i first heard you used that, i thought, shit, that's a lady's gun. now, it's all i use. clean, real clean.}
<A>__{he looks at the gun, still trained at the floor.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{would you really blow us?}
<A>__{rath does not have to answer.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{oh! i got a question. jesus, this has been driving me crazy for years shit, listen to me. i sound like some fucking fanboy. i'm sorry, but i just got to ask you. everybody talks about how you left the agency and got into the business and then how you went after the russian, nicholai talinkov }
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{tachlinkov.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{yeah, that's it. and he's like a fucking genius. they said he shaded you over and over. and in the end, he aced you again. shaded and faded. they say he's living on some greek island, but i say that's fucking bullshit. i say you're the best and that you planted his ass. am i right?}
<A>__{rath says nothing.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{i bet i'm right.}
<A>__{the car passes under a sign indicating the ramp for the cleveland airport.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{robert bain, driving me! jesus fucking christ!}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{after those cops, you'll never be able to come back to cleveland.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{who the fuck cares about cleveland. cleveland blows. what kind of marks have they got here? greasy mobster, teamster or some hand job politician. i want the money marks. i want the marks that you get.}
<A>__{a long beat of silence. the cab rumbles up onto the "departures" ramp which circles past all of the terminals.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{so what happens now?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{we go around once.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{bullshit.}
<A>__{he throws off his seatbelt.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{you tell me that we're gonna go around once, then, while i'm checking out the lay of the land, you bail out and send me flying over the bridge. right? am i right?}
<A>__{rath doesn't answer, studying the terminals, noting the police and airport security. rath studies the terrain. bain studies rath. soon they have passed the entire airport. rath nods. steering the car through traffic in onto a circle interchange that will bring them to the beginning. bain wipes the sweat from his face.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{what? what's okay?}
<A>__{rath begins to accelerate, rounding the interchange.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{there's a sand barricade up ahead; i'm going to ram this cab into it. the cab has an airbag, odds are good i will survive. but with this steel casing and bullet proof glass, odds for you are not so good.}
<A>__{bain laughs.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{oh man, that's sweet. that's fucking sweet.}
<A>__{the speedometer continues to climb.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{you're bluffing.}
<A>__{rath says nothing. ahead, at the ramp to the terminals, is the sand barricade.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{you're fucking with me. you want me to jump. i jump, you hit the brakes and bang game over.}
<A>__{the cab is flying at its target.}
<C>__{bain}
<D>__{no, no. wait. you don't want me to jump. you're going to jump. i'm stuck back here until it's too late. wham over!}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i know you're going to jump.}
<A>__{bain looks at him and then at the barricade.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{you're still young. young enough to still think you're indestructible. invincible. you believe with utter certainty you can bail out at the last second and survive.}
<A>__{the barricade hurtles toward them, rising up, filling the windshield.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{if you do survive, we'll see each other again.}
<A>__{bain screams, throwing open the door and hurling himself out. rath jams on the brakes, tires screaming, steering into the steel side rail, banking the car into the drums of sand as bain hits the pavement, bouncing like a stone skipped across water. a driver hits his brakes, swerving, just missing him. sand explodes from the impact and the cab bounces up over the median into the bus only lanes as the driver's airbag balloons out of the steering wheel. bain rolls and rolls, finally stopping sprawled out like a piece of roadkill. the cab careens up onto a curb, slamming into a pole, the radiator spitting out a cloud of whistling steam. several cars lock up and collide to avoid bain; one car stopping inches from him. a woman jumps out, rushing to the front of the car, but bain is gone. police cars roar up into the midst of the accident. one of them pulling alongside the demolished cab. the door is open, the airbag popped. rath is gone.}
