<A>__{the colonel is washing his ford explorer, squatting to scrub the bumper, when something catches his eye: his pov: lester and the jims jog down the street. the colonel stands, scowling, as ricky comes out of the house, holding the urine sample in front of him.}
<C>__{colonel}
<D>__{what is this, the fucking gay pride parade?}
<A>__{lester breaks off from the two jims and jogs up to ricky and the colonel, out of breath. he grabs hold of his knees and bends over, panting.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{hey! yo! ricky!}
<P>__{(re: the jims)}
<D>__{my entire life is passing before my eyes, and those two have barely broken a sweat.}
<A>__{he laughs, and extends his hand to the colonel.}
<C>__{lester }
<D>__{sorry, hi. lester burnham, i live next door. we haven't met.}
<C>__{colonel}

<C>__{lester}
<D>__{whoa. welcome to the neighborhood, sir.}
<A>__{he salutes the colonel good naturedly, grinning. the colonel doesn't think it's funny. an awkward beat.}
<C>__{lester }
<D>__{so, ricky, uh, i was thinking about the, uh... i was gonna... the movie we talked about...}

<P>__{(before lester can answer)}
<D>__{okay, it's up in my room. come on.}
<A>__{he heads into the house. lester waves at the colonel, then follows him. the colonel watches them go, his eyes dark.}
