<P>__{(musing)}
<D>__{do you think anybody in the fifties ever made love on a bed?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what the hell is that?}
<A>__{flying high above them is an enormous, glowing, liquid neon kite. the center of the kite inscribed in lights, flashing like a marquee: happy birthday peggy sue. the kite begins to descend towards them. peggy jumps to her feet and races towards it. she grabs the tail and starts to sail away with the kite. charlie chases after her.}

<D>__{i'm trying.}
<A>__{as charlie watches helplessly, a huge bolt of lightning strikes his car. peggy smiles. the men from the lodge run outside. they look up and above the blazing car and see peggy floating away. peggy sees her grandfather in the crowd and blows him a kiss. charlie begins to run, following the kite cord to its source. he finds richard, struggling to restrain the runaway kite.}

<A>__{suddenly the cord breaks. peggy floats away.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{peggy!}
<A>__{charlie, richard and the old men behold peggy, bobbing and dipping playfully in the sky. we begin to hear charlie's voice singing "peggy sue" o.s. peggy looks down with wonder at the earth, and then like a comet, soars into the blackness. in an instant she becomes a star.}
<B>__{final scene}
<D>__{dissolve optical}
<A>__{hospital room day moving from two to c.u. peggy, fragments of the reunion, the cake coming towards her, fragments of words in echo effect: 'your heart stopped for a while..." father's voice: 'you're a very lucky young lady...' doctor: 'a (explain) of the head...' mom's voice: 'but you're going to be all right now, the paramedics got there...' mom, 'we were so worried..." echoing of, until once voice is left. charlie. sitting opposite her bed, as he has been every minute of her illness. he looks wan and old, worried sick, but trying to sing 'peggy sue' for her.}

<D>__{it couldn't be me. i hardly knew him.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i will just set it right here.}

<D>__{charlie, please, i need some time.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{well, i will let you get some rest...so long.}
