<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{headline. reporter disembowels self with rusty joke.}
<L>__{exterior green house roof day}
<A>__{quoyle in a carpenter's belt, climbing very carefully from a ladder onto the roof. his vertigo apparent as he keeps to his hands and knees, trying to fight the compulsion to look down. gives in to it, peering from the corner of his eye down the cliff, the rocks, the sea so far below. not a good 1dea. comes to the shingles. eases his way into a fearful crouch. okay. starts hammering. and rehearsing.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{jack, i completely understand, i would fire me, too.}
<A>__{nodding, in time to the hammer strokes.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{in a heartbeat.}
<A>__{hammers louder, speaking in rhythm...}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{you give me a chance, and what happens? i buy the wrong boat, i write the wrong story, i am the lowest form of alleged life. in fact, your comment...}
<A>__{stops.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{...was an insult to the doughnut.}
<A>__{hear now what the hammering had masked. someone is reaching the top of the ladder, climbing onto the roof. bunny. somehow she has managed to climb while carrying a sandwich on a plate. and an open bottle of soda. he stares at her, uncomprehending.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{egg salad and nehi grape.}
<A>__{she sets them down. stands up on the steep pitch.}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{baby...}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{they're mine but i will share.}
<A>__{as the plate and bottle slip neatly off the roof and, after a noticeable beat, shatter softly far below. bunny's turn to be shocked. she's contemplating going after them.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{don't move!!}
<A>__{okay, that was a little loud. it has also scared the kid out of her wits. quoyle regrets this. starts scooching awkwardly down the slope, inches at a time...}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{we're gonna play wait for daddy. can you play that?}
<A>__{she's just staring over the side. hypnotized by the sight. he's slipping toward her. toward the edge.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{and if you don't move. until i get there. then...}
<A>__{closer, reaching toward her back...}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{...then you win!}
<A>__{...grabs her arm, she startles, violently lurching, but he yanks her to him. holds her to his heart. holds her. he is breathing like a freight train.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{that. was so easy.}
