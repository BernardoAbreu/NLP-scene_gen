<L>__{interior stratford house day}
<A>__{kat is sprawled on the couch in sweats, wrapped in a blanket, watching "sixteen candles". when molly ringwald leans across the birthday cake to get a kiss from her dream date, kat changes the channel disgustedly, settling for an infomercial the phone sits next to her. not ringing. bianca breezes in, bearing a cup of tea.}
<C>__{bianca}
<D>__{are you sure you don't want to come with us? it'll be fun.}
<A>__{kat takes the tea and gives a weak smile.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{i ' m sure .}
<A>__{bianca sits down next to her}
<C>__{bianca}
<D>__{you looked beautiful last night, you know.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{so did you}
<A>__{bianca gives her a squeeze, then jumps up when the doorbell rings, opening the door to a waiting cameron. he peeks his head inside.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{she okay?}
<C>__{bianca}
<D>__{i hope so.}
<A>__{the door shuts behind her as walter enters.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{was that your sister?}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{yeah. she left with some bikers big ones. full of sperm.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{funny.}
<A>__{walter sits down on the arm of the chair and watches the infomercial with kat.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i don't understand the allure of dehydrated food. is this something i should be hip to?}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{no, daddy.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(dreading the answer)}
<D>__{so tell me about this dance. was it fun?}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{parts of it.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{which parts?}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{the part where bianca beat the hell out of some guy.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{bianca did what?}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{what's the matter? upset that i rubbed off on her?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{no impressed.}
<A>__{kat looks up in surprise.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{you know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives. it means we've become spectators. bianca still lets me play a few innings. you've had me on the bleachers for years. when you go to sarah lawrence, i won't even be able to watch the game.}
<C>__{kat}
<P>__{(hopeful)}
<D>__{when i go?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{oh, christ. don't tell me you've changed your mind. i already sent 'em a check.}
<A>__{kat reaches over and gives him a hug}
