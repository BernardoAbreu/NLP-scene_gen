<L>__{interior sleeping room.}
<A>__{the doctor and marge come in on the run nancy's flailing and screaming as if the devil himself were after her. king grabs her to shake her awake; angle on nancy (eyes open) looking in terror sound echoed}
<B>__{strangely.}
<A>__{in her pov dressed in king's clothes the horribly scarred man reaches out. wider (nancy's eyes closed in sleep) as the girl's fist shoots out with incredible force and knocks dr king flying! the nurse and marge both descend on her and again in her sleeping pov we see the man stagger for her. wider on nancy (still in her nightmare) fighting like a tiger with both marge and the nurse sending the nurse sprawling leaving marge hanging on for dear life. angle on the stunned doctor fumbling with a hyperdermic needle, spilling most of the stuff on himself with his shaking hands the screams and curses of nancy are deafening and worthy of a stevador fighting off his worst enemy. stranger still, her hair is electrified, standing on end and greying before their very eyes ! marge screams at the top of her lungs.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{nancy!!! it's mom nancy!!!!}
<A>__{some deep bolt of psychic power smacks through the girl, and her eyes flap open they're glazed with terror and fury, but open. nancy's awake. she stares around like a cornered animal in the middle of the bed, her purple face gasping out gut wrenching sobs. the nurse and marge dare to go back in and hold the sweat drenched girl as dr king comes for her with the needle.}
<C>__{dr king}
<D>__{now, this is just going to let you relax and sleep, nan }
<A>__{with incredible swiftness, nancy backhands the hypodermic into a far wall, shattering it into a million pieces.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{no. that's enough sleep.}
<A>__{her eyes are windows straight into white fire as she locks into king's face. he dabs his split lip, swallowing painfully.}
<C>__{dr king}
<D>__{okay, kid. okay. fair enough.}
<A>__{he holds out his hand. nancy at last takes it, and sags back into her pillow, exhausted. then king comes up with blood on his hand. he stares at it, dumbfounded, then at the girl. across her left forearm, a deep gash is bleeding freely, as if made by a very sharp instrument.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{oh my god, oh my god...}
<C>__{dr king}
<P>__{(to the nurse)}
<D>__{get the kit!}
<A>__{the nurse scrambles away as the doctor claps his hand over the wounds. he looks into nancy's face. what he sees frightens him even more: nancy's haunted, ghost like eyes turn from him to her mother, and a terrible, chilling smile opens across nancy's white lips.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{you believe this?}
<A>__{she pulls her free arm from beneath the sheets and reveals a strange hat, filthy and worn the killer's hat. the sight of it frightens marge more than anything that's come before.}
<C>__{marge}
<P>__{(deathly pale)}
<D>__{where the hell did you get that?}
<A>__{nancy fixes her with xray eyes.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{i grabbed it off his head.}
<A>__{marge stares at the hat as if it held her whole future, and her future was a horror.}
