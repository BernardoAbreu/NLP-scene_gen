<A>__{the rain here is icier and more punishing.}
<D>__{vanger v o when the police investigation petered out, i kept at it }
<L>__{interior vanger manor night}
<A>__{they're eating dinner now in the dining room.}
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{ studying their reports and interviews, all the information there was, and it's a lot. i've spent half my life examining the events of a single day.}
<A>__{and for all that, he's no closer to the truth.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i understand your frustration. but what you're asking me to do is a waste of money.}
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{we haven't discussed your fee.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{we don't need to. i can't find something you haven't been able to in forty years.}
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{you don't know that. you have a very keen investigative mind.}
<A>__{blomkvist wonders why he ever agreed to come here as vanger refills his wine glass.}
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{here's what i propose: you come stay on the island. i have a nice little cottage by the water you can use. you study the material i give you. you find something i've missed or you don't.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{you want me to set aside my life and career for something that's a complete waste of time.}
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{think of it as a well deserved vacation. a way of avoiding all the people you want to avoid right now.}
<P>__{(nothing from blomkvist)}
<D>__{as for compensation, i will pay you twice your salary for as many months as it takes. i will quadruple it if you solve the mystery.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{mr. (vanger) }
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{i'm not done. i will throw in one more thing even though you're a terrible negotiator. it's what you want more than anything else and it can't be bought at any price. i will give it to you ... hans erik wennerstrom.}
<A>__{he pushes toward blomkvist a plate: the carcass of the fresh killed and cooked duck they've been eating. it and the mention of wennerstrom's name clouds, at least for a moment, blomkvist's memory of the train he missed.}
<C>__{vanger}
<D>__{he began his career working for me. and i've followed it with interest, shall we say, ever since. you were right about him. you just couldn't prove it.}
