<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{black screen. sounds: screaming, laughing, crying. sights: light, bodies falling, a dark skull... and we are }
<L>__{interior stone cell dawn}
<A>__{wayne opens his eyes. unshaven. filthy. someone else is in the cell wayne cannot move to look even the attempt is painful...the skull drifts into his sight. bane. squatting at wayne's bedside, muscled shoulders curving into his mask.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{why didn't you just kill me?}
<C>__{bane}
<D>__{you don't fear death. you welcome it. your punishment is to be more severe.}
<C>__{wayne}
<P>__{(scathing)}
<D>__{you're a torturer...}
<C>__{bane}
<D>__{yes. but not of your body. of your soul.}
<A>__{wayne exhales. eyes losing focus from sheer pain.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{where am i?}
<C>__{bane}
<D>__{home.}
<A>__{wayne's eyes dart about: filthy stone walls, distant sunlight from above, iron bars: an underground prison.}
<D>__{where i learned the truth about}
<P>__{despair. as will you. (rises.)}
<D>__{there is a reason that this prison is the worst hell on earth...}
<A>__{bane steps to the bars looks up at a bright opening five hundred feet above. like being at the bottom of a gigantic well...}
<D>__{hope. every man who has rotted here over the centuries has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom. so simple. so easy. and, like shipwrecked men turning to sea water from uncontrollable thirst, many have died trying. i learned that there can be no true despair without hope. (turns to wayne.) so as i terrorize gotham, i will feed its people hope to poison their souls. i will let them believe they can survive so that you can watch them clamber over each other to stay in the sun...}
<A>__{bane points to an old tv, just outside the bars.}
<D>__{you will watch as i torture an entire city to cause you pain you thought you could never feel again. then, when you have truly understood the depths of your failure, we will fulfill ra's al ghul's destiny. we will destroy gotham. and when it is done...when gotham is ashes...then you have my permission to die.}
<A>__{bane rises. leaves. wayne drifts back to unconsciousness.}
