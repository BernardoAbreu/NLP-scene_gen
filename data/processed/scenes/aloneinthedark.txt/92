<L>__{interior hudgens' laboratory}
<A>__{hudgens walks through a dank cement room. various pieces of scientific equipment sit in a corner. shelves are lined with ancient artifacts, small sculptures, and masks. hudgens stops at a work station and pauses. a look of pain crosses his face. he winces, holding it in. he steadies himself. at the other side of the lab is a large recess in the space. the opening is covered by thick cage bars covered in gold. the cage appears to be empty. but suddenly, an invisible creature slams into the bars of the cage, trying to lunge at hudgens. as it hits the bars, fingers of electricity jolt through it, making it visible for a split second. hudgens watches calmly. he goes to a small dial built into the wall beside the cage. hudgens turns up the dial. in the cage, jagged bolts of electricity jolt around the invisible creature. it squeals and hisses from the electricity. finally, the creature collapses and fades visible. the creature is unconscious, but still alive. hudgens turns the dial back down. hudgens picks up a hypodermic syringe from a counter next to the cage. he injects the syringe into the creature's neck, between two of its scales. he withdraws a syringe full of the creature's black, sticky blood. he goes back to the work station, rolling up the sleeve of his shirt. his arm is pocked with injection marks. hudgens ties off his arm, preps a vein, and injects himself with the syringe of creature's blood. he closes his eyes, feeling the substance flow into him.}
