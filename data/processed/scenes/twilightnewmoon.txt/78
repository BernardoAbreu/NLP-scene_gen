<L>__{interior bella's bedroom (continuous) night}
<A>__{ jacob lands on the balls of his feet. bella is stunned. he freezes, listening for charlie. nothing. a bitter, self satisfied grin spreads on his face. it pisses bella off. he takes in her room.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i pictured your room more... cluttered.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{why are you here?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i had to talk to you. alone.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{to kick me in the gut again? it was bad before, but you made it so much worse.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i know. and i want to explain. but... i can't.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{then leave.}
<A>__{he stays put. she tries to push him but he's immoveable.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{you're done with me, remember? get. out!}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{bella, i literally can't explain...}
<A>__{she becomes aware of her hands on his bare skin and muscular chest. the intimacy of their touch. she pulls away.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i broke my promise not to hurt you, i know. but i'm trying to keep it now. i need you to understand... even if you don't want to see me when you find out }
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{find what out?}
<A>__{he starts to speak but can't. it's agonizing. she sees he's in pain. is concerned.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i can't do it.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{yes, you can. i will help you. we can... we can leave. leave home, leave sam.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{it's not something i can run away from.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{i would run with you though. if i could.}
<P>__{(beat, realizing)}
<D>__{wait. wait, i already i told you. you know this you can guess.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{i don't want to play games with you }
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you have to! i can't tell you, but if you remember it was that day i ran into you at the beach. i told you a story come on! i told you a story... about?}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{... about... "the cold ones?" you said it was a stupid tribal myth.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(pointedly)}
<D>__{was it? are the cold ones a myth?}
<A>__{she doesn't answer.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what else did i say?}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{that... the tribe made a treaty with them. they can't come onto your land and... i don't know, i don't remember.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{try, bella.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{you have to give me more. tell me where to look. is there something i should see ?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no, that's too dangerous }
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{i will take the risk. jacob, show me.}
<A>__{he looks at her, doesn't want to but knows it's the only way. beat.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{where was the last place you saw me... the way i used to be?}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{the motorcycles that clearing in the woods.}
<A>__{he nods slowly, then turns to go. she stops him.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{don't go. there are dangerous things out there; more than you know.}
<A>__{he looks at her with a wry smile. then pulls her into a hug. her cheek against his bare chest. she takes in the closeness... then he soundlessly heads out her door. a beat bella starts pulling on clothes.}
