<L>__{interior police station (day) med. shot}
<A>__{a medium sized office, saved from plainness of civil service decor by a few personal decorations of the inspector. he waves the mckenna to chairs, as he goes around behind his desk and remains standing. ben and jo sit down. the inspector looks at some papers on his desk, then holds out his hand.}
<C>__{inspector}
<P>__{(precisely)}
<D>__{your passports, please.}
<A>__{ben looks at jo, who fishes for them in her purse. she takes them out, hands them to ben, who hands them to the inspector. he scrutinizes them. uncomfortable, ben retreats to a chair and sits down, waiting. the inspector checks the pictures against the people he sees sitting in his office, then puts the passports down on his desk.}
<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{you entered french morocco four days ago.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{you are a doctor, monsieur?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{a surgeon. a tourist, and an american citizen.}
<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{three good reasons why you should have nothing in common with louis bernard.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i didn't have.}
<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{you were recently in paris?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{a medical convention.}
<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{you come to marrakesh with him in the same bus. you drank an aperitif with him in your hotel room. and you ate at the same restaurant last night.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{but at different tables.}
<A>__{the inspector's eyes study her briefly, as if her comment was an unnecessary interruption. then his eyes return to ben.}
<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{so, louis bernard is a stranger to you?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i met him yesterday on the bus for the first time in my life.}
<A>__{the inspector begins to let his skepticism be seen.}
<C>__{inspector}
<P>__{(ironically)}
<D>__{and yet out of five thousand people in a great market place he comes to you when he is about to die! is that the action of a casual acquaintance, monsieur?}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(obstinate)}
<D>__{i know nothing about louis bernard.}
<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{no? not even, i suppose, that he was an agent of the deuxieme bureau?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{perhaps you have also never head of the american f.b.i.?}
<P>__{(sadly)}
<D>__{it would be so much more easy for both of us, monsieur, if you would cease to pretend.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{now, look here...}
<C>__{inspector}
<P>__{(patiently)}
<D>__{the dead man found out what he had been sent here to discover. that is why he was kill ed. he told you what he had discovered. why? because he placed complete confidence in you. voila.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{boy, you not only ask the questions you also answer them wait a minute let me ask you a question.}
<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{indeed, monsieur?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{assuming bernard trusted me as implicitly as you say, i would never reveal anything he said to me, would i?}
<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{even americans, i suppose, sometimes find it desirable to betray a confidence?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{let's get something straight. i'm a tourist traveling for pleasure. i somehow got involved in an unfortunate incident. i came down here to make a simple statement of fact, and not to be subjected to a police grilling.}
<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{monsieur, i would like....}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{now hold your horses! just hold them.}
<A>__{the door opens suddenly. the two men look up.}
