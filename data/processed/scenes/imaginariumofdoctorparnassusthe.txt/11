<A>__{anton moves through the cut out trees and into a fantastic, brightly coloured landscape of dr. seuss like hills and valleys. the sky if full of cloud sized soap bubbles. diego is in the distant using his game controller to make the bubbles bang into each other...trying to burst them. we can hear valentina trying to continue the pitch in the face of the family from hell. their baby has now started wailing. cracks in the ground begin to appear under anton"s feet.}
