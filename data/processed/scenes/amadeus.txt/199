<L>__{interior mozart's apartment living room night 1790's}
<A>__{the introduction ends and suddenly the brilliant fast fugue begins. instantly mozart starts to dance to it, all alone: gleefully, like a child. he looks up at his father's portrait, and makes a silly, rude gesture at it. he is, briefly, an irresponsible and happy boy again. then suddenly there is a gentle knocking at the door. the music fades down. warily, mozart crosses and opens he door. the familiar dark chords from don giovanni cut across the happy music. it ends. before him stands the masked stranger.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{i don't have it yet. it's not finished. i'm sorry, but i need more time.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{are you neglecting my request?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{no, no! i promise you, i will give you a wonderful piece the best i ever can!}
<A>__{he turns and looks. constanze has come into the living room. nervously, mozart indicates her.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{this is my wife, stanzi. i've been sick, but i'm all right now. aren't i?}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{oh yes, sir. he's all right. and he's working on it very hard.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{give me two more weeks. please.}
<A>__{salieri contemplates them both.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{the sooner you finish, the better your reward. work!}
<A>__{he turns and goes down the stairs. mozart shuts the door; he closes his eyes in fear.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{wolfi, i think you really are going mad. you work like a slave for that idiot actor who won't give you a penny and here. this is not a ghost! this is a real man who puts down real money. why on earth don't you finish it?}
<A>__{he will not look at her or reply.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{give me one reason i can understand.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{i can't write it!}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{it's killing me.}
<A>__{he looks at her suddenly.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{no, this is really awful. you're drunk, aren't you? be honest tell me you've been drinking. and i'm so stupid i stay here and listen to you!}
<A>__{suddenly she starts to cry.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{it's not fair! i worry about you all the time. i try to help you all i can and you just drink and talk nonsense and and frighten me! it's not fair!}
<A>__{her tears flow. mozart looks at her helplessly.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{go back to bed.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{please! let me sit here. let me stay here with you. i promise i won't say all word. i will just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. please, please!}
<A>__{she sits down tearfully, staring at him. we hear the rex tremendai majestatis from the requiem and see on the wall the portrait of leopold mozart looking down. the camera pans slowly downward from it back to the table. mozart is writing the music. he looks up and sees that constanze is fast asleep in her chair. mozart gets up quietly. he puts on his hat and cloak, takes a bottle of wine and tiptoes from the house. without stopping, the music changes from the heavy requiem to the light hearted patter of the papa papa duet from the magic flute.}
