<L>__{interior coffin later}
<A>__{darkness once again. we hear the sound of paul slowly awaking, followed the sight of zippo sparks. it doesn't catch. the second glow stick is snapped, illuminating the coffin with a fluorescent green hue. paul starts to move, but suddenly freezes. his eyes widen. his pupils dilate. something is clearly very wrong, though we cannot see what. his eyes slowly shift downward, as if watching something move down his body. beads of sweat form across his brow. his measured breaths are held for as long as they can be. moving excruciatingly slow, paul lowers the glow stick toward what he is looking at. a shape moves across his stomach, underneath his t shirt. paul's eyes are fixed on whatever it may be. he cautiously, slowly, moves the glow stick even closer. the shape disappears just as the light of the glow stick shines on whatever it may be. still, paul does not dare make any sudden move. paul's pant leg moves slightly, starting at the top, slowly undulating toward his cuff. paul leans the glow stick in further. and further. carefully. moving a millimeter at a time. he shifts the position of his head slightly, charily, to see next to his feet. he leans in even closer with the glow stick. but then his wary movement comes to immediate stop. it's a snake. a two foot, saw scaled viper. it has positioned itself in the corner of the coffin, inches from paul's feet. his terror evident, paul very slowly pulls his feet back toward his upper body, away from the snake. the confined space offers little room for safety. the snake turns its muscled neck to face paul. their eyes meet for the first time. the snake hisses, poised to strike at any moment. paul raises his foot. steels himself. prepares to preempt the snake with a solid stomp. a more sensible plan soon prevails. after lowering his foot, paul cautiously removes the flask from his pocket. slowly unscrews the top. splashes a small amount of alcohol on the floor, close to the snake. the snake recoils slightly, but then menacingly twists itself into a new posture, ready to attack. paul lowers the zippo to the small puddle of alcohol. after a few sparks it lights. a flash fire. the snake flails and hisses wildly at the other side of a small fire wall. the flame soon goes out. paul moves fast. throws more alcohol, this time some of it lands on the snake itself. he places the already lit zippo against the puddle of alcohol near the snake. another flash fire, this time burning the snake. it hisses loudly. threateningly. it swings back and forth, challenging the small wall of fire. the fire soon extinguishes. the snake burrows into the hole from where it likely entered the coffin, disappearing into it with haste. paul hurriedly stuffs the hole with his discarded button down shirt. he then pours a small amount of alcohol over the shirt and temporarily puts the flask on the ground, but does not screw the cap on securely. he then wedges the lit zippo between a small space between two wooden planks. with the snake situation handled, paul finally lets out a sigh of relief. rubs his eyes. tries to regain his faculties. looks over the list of phone numbers written above him. suddenly, the cell phone vibrates. paul frenziedly searches for it, but he cannot find it. he then notices it has fallen into the small hole near his feet, out of his reach. he makes several attempts to grab the phone with his feet, but he is unable to do so. it continues to ring. his next efforts involve repositioning himself in the coffin so that he completely turns to face the opposite end. struggling through each move, paul painstakingly begins to turn himself. while turning, however, he inadvertently kicks the zippo from the side of the coffin landing it on the floor, up against the glow stick and knocks over the flask. we see that the flame of the zippo slowly melts the plastic glow stick, causing it to dim slightly. worst still, and completely unbeknownst to paul, a stream of alcohol slowly makes its way from the flask and toward the flame of the lighter, threatening to set the coffin ablaze. inch by inch, the flammable spirit gets closer. still in the midst of his repositioning, paul looks back and sees the alcohol nearing the flame. in a panic, he attempts to reach and grab the zippo. but, he finds himself stuck in the middle of the coffin. he can't budge either way.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no, no, no!!}
<A>__{desperately straining every muscle in his body, he extends his arm backward toward the zippo, hoping to move it away from the spilled alcohol. he still can't reach it, yet he tries with all his might. the phone stops ringing. he has missed the call. he tries blowing at the flame, but his head is too far away and his breath is not strong enough to do much more than cause it to flicker. with the alcohol now mere inches away from the flame, paul reaches for his shoe. his odd positioning makes reaching his foot almost impossible. he struggles to undo the laces and remove it from his foot. with his face beet red from the force of his strain, paul finally removes his shoe. the mere inch of leg room this creates allows him to slide his leg out from under him. the trail of alcohol is just about to come into contact with the flame but paul deftly maneuvers his body just in time to awkwardly kick the zippo out of the way and close the lid. paul breaths an enormous sigh of relief as he sits in the dim light of the damaged glow stick. he notices another hole in the coffin. as a precaution, he stuffs it with the cloth that had previously been used to gag him. just as he is about to grab the phone, he hears what appears to be the faint sound of a muslim call to prayer being announced over the citywide pa system. the sound barely makes its way through the hundreds of pounds of sand that envelop the coffin. a sign of hope, as well as a point of reference for his location albeit a very vague one. he listens further as the call to prayer continues. the light of the glow stick dims further. paul then opens his phone. sees that he missed jabir's call. he starts to call jabir back, but stops. he instead navigates through the various display menus. he soon reaches what appears to be the tools menu, though it's difficult to tell because everything is written in arabic. he becomes frustrated as he fails to find what he is looking for. on the verge of mental surrender, he sees something that gives him pause. a smile crosses his face.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(re: the phone screen)}
<D>__{there you are.}
<A>__{we see, on the display of the phone, that paul has found a listing of languages. he scrolls past many "francais, detsche, espanol" stopping at "english." presses the button, instantly making all the text on the screen readable. he quickly navigates to the tools menu. scrolls down. locates the number of the cell phone he is using. he scribbles the number onto the top of the coffin. then a second pass, making it bolder than the others. paul then dials his wife's cell phone. after only a few rings, he is met by her voice mail.}
<C>__{linda }
<D>__{hi, this is linda. please leave a message. thanks and have a great day.}
<A>__{the beep sounds, and paul frantically proceeds right into his message.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{linda, here's the number for the phone. i just found it out. it's 07902 42 884. you have to use the international calling code first.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{please call me as soon as you get this. i love you...i love you. call me right away. please.}
<A>__{paul hangs up. he looks at the battery life left on the phone. one bar. he then checks his watch. it's 8:19pm. both are not good signs, and he knows it.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{oh shit.}
<A>__{he begins to panic. grabbing the pocket knife that was left inside the metal box, he slides the blade in the space between the sides of the coffin and the top. paul grabs the glow stick. but, because it was partially melted to the floor, the stick snaps in two. liquid oozes out of the small portion of the stick that remains stuck the floor.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{son of a...}
<A>__{paul grabs the flashlight. turns it on. it works for a second, but then goes out. shaking it only produces intermittent beams of light. he turns the top, switching to the red bulb. it works. the coffin fills with a reddish hue, but then it, too, goes out. growing incensed, paul switches back to the white bulb. it works. he returns his attention to the coffin. his efforts to use the knife as a fulcrum are futile. still, he tries. bending the blade well past its design, it nearly breaks off its handle. the flashlight turns off. after a good shaking, it turns back on, emitting white light. with oxygen levels extremely diminished, efforts of this kind are all too much for paul to take. he has to stop and try to catch his breath. as he endeavors to get his wind back, the cell phone rings. not a call this time, but instead a video message. it has been sent by jabir. paul's trepidation is evident. he fears what the incoming video may show. after a beat, he presses the accept button and the video downloads. within seconds, the video plays on his phone display screen. we see, in the video, the american woman that previously appeared in a picture message that was sent to paul. she is still bound at her wrists, but her gag has been lowered. she sits on her knees. standing behind her are three men, all with their faces shielded by arab headdresses. they each hold ak 47 assault weapons. paul watches in horror as the terrified woman speaks, through her tears, into the camera.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{my name is pamela gorham. i'm a food service worker at f.o.b. anaconda, employed by crestin, roland and thomas. my captors' requests for ransom have gone unanswered, and }
<A>__{the woman, pamela, looks off screen to her right. someone is fast approaching her. she cowers, protectively holding her bound hands in front of her face as she screams.}
<C>__{woman }
<P>__{(to the person)}
<D>__{no...wait!! please no!!}
<A>__{another iraqi man steps into the camera's line of site, a handgun already brandished. without as much as a moment's hesitation, he fires two rounds directly into pamela's head, killing her. the video message ends immediately thereafter. paul is in complete shock. he screams aloud, slamming his closed fist against the bottom of the coffin.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no! no, no, no!!!}
<A>__{still in the throes of emotional torment, paul vomits on himself. he doubles over, only to vomit once again. his body, taxed almost to the point of complete physical breakdown, gradually slows and levels itself. with his vomit smeared face pressed cheek down onto the bottom of the coffin, paul stares into nothingness. after a beat, his eye catches a glimmer of light the blade of the knife, reflecting off the beam of the flashlight. paul reaches for the knife. lying on his back, still suffering enormous mental strain, he places the cutting edge of the blade against his neck. his jugular vein. his hand shakes, his lips tremble. the hand that holds the blade tightens its grip on the handle. it, too, shakes. paul closes his eyes. a small amount of blood begins to drip from the side of his neck, where the blade of the knife rests, ready to open his vein. after a great deal of consideration, paul throws the knife to the foot of the coffin. he can't do it. the flashlight falls from paul's chest. it turns off upon landing on the floor of the coffin. paul sits in darkness. his breaths echo off the coffin walls. after a beat, he turns on the flashlight. it turns off after less than two seconds. this time, however, he does not shake it, nor does he hit it. a moment later, we hear a click, followed by the sight of a red light beam emitting from the flashlight. it holds steady. paul shines it onto the names and phone numbers written on the top of the coffin. he stops at "mark white." after a beat, he lowers the flashlight to his side. he picks up the phone and dials brenner. after one ring, brenner answers. he's clearly not pleased. paul, however, is surprisingly calm. detached. almost disturbingly so.}
