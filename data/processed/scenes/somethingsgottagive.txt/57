<A>__{erica looks up and sees something that takes her breath away.}
<B>__{a couple zigzagging around tables}
<A>__{and headed in her direction. a sexy young thing followed by her date no other than harry. harry stops to shake someone's hand, holds his date around the waist. suddenly, the sound drops out of the restaurant as harry and his date walk right by erica's table in slow motion, not noticing her.}
<B>__{moving in on erica}
<A>__{as the room comes alive again. her eyes follow harry as he is seated only one table away, his back to erica, his date facing her. marin hasn't seen him. erica tries her hardest to act normal but apparently isn't.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{mom, you okay?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{yeah, fine.}
<A>__{erica looks at her menu then her eyes go right back to harry. his date is laughing at something harry is saying. harry leans in to her, whispers something to her. she touches his hand.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{you know what? maybe i need a little air...}
<A>__{erica rises; grabs her purse, almost bumps into a waiter as she passes harry's table, knocks into someone's chair, a glass breaks. everyone turns to her, including harry. she now stands right at his table. he smiles up at her.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{hello... harry.}
<P>__{(to his date)}
<D>__{hello...}
