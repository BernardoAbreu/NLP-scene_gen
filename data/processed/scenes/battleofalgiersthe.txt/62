<L>__{61 fish market. inside. day. 6:15 p.m.}
<A>__{a large warehouse in the fish market. there are enormous iceboxes with cartons of frozen fish and tubs with running water and live fish. the three girls are next to one another. the three bags are on top of the counter, a few steps away. with them is a thin algerian about twenty five years old. he has thick black hair, straight and combed neatly. he is wearing glasses. with his rough and nervous hands, he pulls out the towel and bathing suit from hassiba's bag, then delicately and carefully, a square wooden box. he opens it, and turning to the girl, signals her to move away a bit. the girl steps back. in the box, there is a huge iron tube, sealed at both ends by two clock dials. inside the tube, two batteries with wires are attached to the dials. the youth glances at his wristwatch, then adjusts the hands of the dials to six forty five. he puts the bomb back into the box, closes it, and places it in the bag. he replaces the towel and bathing suit, then hands the bag to hassiba. he is smiling slightly. hassiba takes the bag and goes away. the box fits perfectly into djamila's cosmetic case. the youth opens it without removing it from the case, adjusts the two dials to six fifty, puts everything back in its place, and hands the case to djamila. he smiles at her and she moves away. in the air france bag, there are newspapers and magazines on top, and the same box. the youth adjusts the bomb to six fifty five, arranges it again inside the bag, closes the zipper, and hands the bag to zohra. he smiles at her. his smile is more genuine, less mechanical. there is less tension than before. the youth smiles at the girl and says in arabic:}
<C>__{algerian}
<D>__{may allah protect you.}
<A>__{zohra thanks him in a whisper, bends her head, and moves away. the youth takes a cigarette from his shirt pocket, places it between his lips, and lights it. his hand is trembling a little.}
