<L>__{interior it's raining men strip joint night}
<A>__{a really buff stripper dressed as a construction worker is on stage with about ten others who stand in the background. the emcee's hand hovers above the stripper's head.}
<C>__{emcee}
<D>__{okay, ladies, it's down to... troy the human jackhammer...}
<A>__{the women applaud as we... follow the emcee's hand to hawk who holds an ice pack on the side of his head.}
<C>__{emcee}
<D>__{...and mr. massive head wound accompanied by an upset stomach hawk!}
<A>__{the women applaud but not quite as loud.}
<C>__{emcee}
<D>__{no contest. the grand prize of seventy five dollars goes to troy the human jackhammer!}
<A>__{the women cheer and a disco song starts as troy does a reprise of his act. hawk walks away from the stage with the rest of the rejected strippers, looking the way he feels: pretty damn stupid. he puts on his pants, trying to walk at the same time and falls to his knees. a helpful hand grabs him under the arm and helps him up. it's amanda looking lustier than ever.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{thanks, miss.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{you're too kind. i'm amanda.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{don't be so glum, hawk. the night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{i'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.}
<A>__{hawk gulps.}
