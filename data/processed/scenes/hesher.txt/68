<A>__{tj runs. he jumps fences and slips down the sides of houses. he's running fast and breathing hard. he finds his way out onto another dark and quiet street. he stops. he has no idea where he is or where to go. then headlights appear at the end of the street. they bear down on him slowly. tj stands immobile. he can now see it is hesher's van, approaching slow and menacing. the van stops about 10 feet from tj. a moment's stand off. then hesher sticks his head out the window.}

<D>__{you fucking ditched me.}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{get in the van, dude.}
<A>__{tj doesn't move. he stares. hesher revs the engine. hesher revs the engine some more. tj still doesn't move. hesher floors the van. on tj the headlights of the van bear down on him. hesher slams on the brakes and the van screeches to a halt inches from tj's nose. tj doesn't flinch. he and hesher stare at each other through the windshield. hesher smiles. he's impressed. tj walks around to the passenger door.}
