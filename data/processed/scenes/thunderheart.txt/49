<L>__{interior buffalo butte bar day}
<A>__{dark. even during the day. cigarette smoke. sawdust. on the archaic juke box, randy travis sings "old 8x10" while behind the bar, the bar owner, an old man with long white hair and beard, busies himself with leather work. several white locals sit on the old water drum bar stools. heads lift, turn when ray enters in his "fraternizing" clothes jeans and boots, leather jacket. he scuffs up thick sawdust as he heads to the furthest booth back where crow horse sits, alone over a bourbon and a beer. ray approaches carefully, upset by the sight. he slides into the booth and point blanks the indian.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{agent little weasel, federal bura of your imagination.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{jesus christ. you're hammered. what are you doing?}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{you're right about the old man. his power's long dried up. he's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. he says we changed, and we don't listen. well, he don't go out and talk no more. i haven't had a drink in three years but i just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this hoss is gettin' watered.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{cut the shit. you shouldn't be in here, man.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{cuz i'm a skin?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{cuz you're a cop.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{not no more.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{you tell me. you tell me who went to the b.i.a. bureau of indian annihilation and said i was messin' with your case, man. i don't give a goddamn about your case.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{and i don't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not, crow horse, but i didn't cut you.}
<A>__{crow horse shimmers his black eyes onto ray.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{still after jimmy?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{they found prints at blue legs' place.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{yeah. jimmy's prints are there. but they cross over benjamin black star's prints. and he wasn't there until six o'clock the mornin' after to get eggs from the chickens. so jimmy wasn't there til the next day. follow?}
<A>__{ray just looks vacantly at crow horse. crow horse resents the vacancy.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{look, man... you better bust jimmy and get out before somebody shoots up more than your car next time.}
<A>__{ray glares at him.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{next time i will be ready. you get the word to who ever it is.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{i can't, hoss. i don't talk to fbi's.}
<A>__{ray doesn't blink.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{you think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{no. i was sent here cuz i'm indian. and a good cop.}
<A>__{crow horse leans toward ray and speaks more quietly.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{you ever think that maybe you was sent here cuz the fbi's need one good reason to take out the entire warrior movement. and what better reason than one of their men, gettin' blown away on the res. a low rent, expendable public servant sent in to take a bullet for his country.}
<A>__{ray is fuming. he can't believe what he's hearing, what's being insinuated, but he's giving it thought and it's getting him angry. he smashes a hand down on the table.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i'm sick of your shit }
<C>__{rancher }
<D>__{i'm sick of the two of ya timber niggers spewin' off.}
<A>__{standing over the booth is a long, tall rancher's son. rangey with red curly hair tucked under a black hills classic cap, and arms built by tractor work. and behind him, two older ranchers fall in. and another young man, grinning with amusement. ray and crow horse look up.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{sorry, we don't speak united states.}
<C>__{rancher's son}
<D>__{yeah, well i do. get the jesus up, and get the jesus out or i'm gonna go out to my truck and come back with my hardware.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{woh, hold on there, jack, you're }
<C>__{rancher's son}
<D>__{ don't "jack" me, squanto. i will bury your lazy ass right here.}
<A>__{ray realizes now that they think he's indian, too. crow horse sees this revelation and complicates it by suddenly speaking lakota to ray. the rancher grabs ray by the cheeks.}
<C>__{rancher's son}
<D>__{i'm talkin' to }
<A>__{ray decks him. backhands him in the solar plexus then, lays a burner of a quantico roundhouse to his ear, knocking him across the bar, over a mop and bucket and into sawdust. the others start to fall at him but someone has jumped in, holding them back, and sticking himself in the way. it is brooks. the old timer ray met his first night here.}
<C>__{brooks}
<D>__{no! no, you butt holes! he ain't skin! he ain't skin!}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{yeah he's in'dn. miniconjou sioux.}
<A>__{the rancher's son who is coming back with a broken beer bottle, slows his step and shifts his eyes from brooks to the young fed there is a lot of heavy breathing. but no talking just yet. the young rancher eyes ray.}
<C>__{rancher's son}
<D>__{you ain't indian?}
<A>__{ray just stands tense, staring at him. and it's strange. because he hasn't really looked like he has any indian blood up to this moment. but dressed the way he is, and his eyes glaring, face drawing tense, he might pass for a breed although that's probably the italian. but ray doesn't answer the question. crow horse starts laughing. drunkenly.}
<C>__{older rancher}
<D>__{what's so damn funny?}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{well, it's just that the cavalry used to always threaten the lakota. the cavalry ain't around anymore. the lakota still are.}
<C>__{rancher's son}
<D>__{i got no trouble tellin' where you come from, fat red.}
<A>__{crow horse rises and walks unsteadily across the floor, leaving the bar. brooks is whispering to the others, apparently about who ray is. the bar man comes up to ray, holding a tray, on which sits a shot and a beer. ray looks at it for a moment.}
<C>__{bar man}
<D>__{sorry. on the house.}
<A>__{ray knocks the tray out of his hand, spilling beer and whiskey all over the bar man and the locals around him. and he walks out, leaving the locals confused.}
