<A>__{a reb battalion waits in a foggy meadow that slopes down to marsh. beyond that is the gulf of mexico. we recognize one of the rebs from the cathouse. he opens his pocket watch.}
<D>__{reb #1 they oughta be here by now. reb #2 maybe we're in the wrong place. reb #1}
<P>__{(rechecks map)}
<D>__{no, we're supposed to wait 'xactly on this here spot.}
<A>__{suddenly they hear a clanking and screeching coming from the marsh. they ready their arms and get in defensive positions. what they can't see through the fog is... angle marsh armored tank amphibiously sludges up through the mud and reeds, passing by the dumbstruck soldiers as it heads to the center of the field. the contraption has a large cannon and gatling guns bristling from several ports. the rebs cheer their new weapon.}
