<L>__{interior manor house dining room day}
<A>__{athos and phillippe are having breakfast.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{no, wait, do not hold your goblet that way. with a king it is... so.}
<A>__{he shows him, pinching the goblet between thumb and forefinger, as the other three fingers extend daintily.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{it is not to be dainty. servants have touched the king's goblet, so he will touch it as little as possible.}
<A>__{phillippe tries it and the goblet slips from his fingers, crashing onto his plate and spilling onto everything.}
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{i am so sorry! forgive me, i }
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{no! do not be sorry! never be sorry! the king cares for nothing and for no one! there are no mistakes when you are king! what you do is right for every person! a king has contempt for everyone!}
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{is that the king of king you wish me to be? or do you say this because of your son?}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{how did you know ?}
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{porthos told me.}
<A>__{for a moment athos can say nothing; then he shoves back from the table and storms from the room.}
