<D>__{you all know that some of my best inspiration comes from personal experience. who knew that my botched foray into hair plugs would lead to last month's award winning expose "hair today, gone tomorrow"? hat's off to you, bruns.}
<A>__{we pan over to bruns, a reporter whose hair is missing in odd looking clumps. he nods sadly.}
<C>__{rigfort}
