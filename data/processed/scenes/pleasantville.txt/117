<L>__{interior soda shop.}
<A>__{the door opens and she sticks her head inside. most of the place is dark except for one streak of sunlight shining through the window near the back of the store. betty glances around. the little bell jingles as she enters.}
<C>__{mr. johnson }
<D>__{we're closed right now ...}
<B>__{different angle.}
<A>__{he sits in front of a small easel near the back, staring at a board which doubles as a canvas. mr. johnson glances over his shoulder and recognizes betty in the doorway.}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{oh, hi ...}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(turning to leave)}
<D>__{i'm sorry ...}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{no, no ... come on in.}
<B>__{reverse angle.}
<A>__{he gets up from his stool and crosses toward the door, still holding the palette in his hand. betty stares at the "cubist christmas" in the window.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i just thought ... it's beautiful.}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{their eyes lock for a second. sort of a clutzy silence. mr. johnson motions toward his easel.}
<C>__{mr. johnson }
<D>__{i was just trying to do one of these "still lifes."}
<A>__{he sighs and looks behind him. next to the easel is a bowl of}
<B>__{gray fruit.}
<C>__{mr. johnson }
<D>__{having kind of a tough time.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i think it looks nice.}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{well ...}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{here's what it's s'posed to look like.}
<A>__{he leads her over to the table and points down at the art book. it's open to a cezanne that nearly burns off the page.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{oh my ...}
<B>__{closer.}
<A>__{they are standing almost on top of each other gazing down at the book. neither one of them moves. betty almost disappears into the pictures drawn by a strange new world.}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{here. look at this.}
<A>__{he turns to kandinsky a massive swirl of color. the image is nearly electric.}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(breathless)}
<D>__{where'd you get this?}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{bud brought it to me.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{bud?}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{here's my favorite.}
<B>__{insert. book.}
<A>__{he turns the page near the back to one of picasso's "weeping women." the woman is rendered in pink and red and green. her head is a large sphere, laying "peacefully" on her own shoulder.}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<A>__{she doesn't answer ...}
<C>__{mr. johnson }
<D>__{isn't it great how she's resting like that?}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(faintly)}
<D>__{she's crying.}
<B>__{wider.}
<A>__{mr. johnson looks down at the painting.}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{she's crying.}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{no she's not.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{yes she is.}
<A>__{he looks up at her ...}
<B>__{reverse angle.}
<A>__{a single tear is running down betty's cheek. she senses it and reaches up to wipe it quickly away, but instead of just wiping the tear, she takes off a huge swath of gray make up. a long strip of pink flesh is revealed underneath.}
<B>__{angle. mr. johnson.}
<A>__{he stares up at her in amazement.}
<B>__{angle. betty.}
<A>__{she senses something and glances down at her hand. her fingertips are covered in gray make up. betty turns and bolts for the door.}
<B>__{wider.}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<P>__{(following her)}
<D>__{wait ...}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i've got to go ...}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{it's alright.}
<A>__{he stops her near the door and she turns her face toward the wall. mr. johnson touches her shoulder.}
<C>__{mr. johnson }
<D>__{it's alright. let me see.}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(shame)}
<D>__{no ...}
<A>__{he reaches up and gently touches her chin. mr. johnson moves around to glimpse the other side of her cheek.}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<D>__{it's beautiful.}
<B>__{closer ...}
<A>__{she freezes like that for a moment, then slowly, haltingly, turns toward him. the color of her real flesh is revealed underneath. betty stands there exposed.}
<C>__{mr. johnson}
<P>__{(a whisper)}
<D>__{... it's beautiful.}
<A>__{she swallows, not sure what to do. betty glances down.}
<C>__{mr. johnson }
<D>__{you shouldn't cover that up.}
<A>__{mr. johnson reaches over to the little napkin dispenser on the counter and pulls one out. he leans forward and dabs at the tears beneath betty's eyes. then slowly, gently, he starts to wipe the makeup off her cheek.}
<B>__{closer still ...}
<A>__{she recoils a bit, tensing up, then just looks at him. mr. johnson is gazing at her "true color" with wonder and acceptance. she hesitates for an instant, then seems to make a decision. betty slowly turns her face to the side, exposing her flesh all the way down to the neck. mr. johnson continues to wipe off the make up in larger and larger strokes as the beautiful pink flesh begins to emerge ...}
