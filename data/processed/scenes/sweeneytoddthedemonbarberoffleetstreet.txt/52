<L>__{exterior fleet street day}
<A>__{...the face of the beggar woman. she sits, crouched on her haunches, peering up from under her few greasy locks of hair. she is watching something intently. a few pedestrians move quickly down the sidewalk past her, excited. they chatter back and forth eagerly... the beggar woman uncoils and follows... and we finally see what the beggar woman has been watching so intently...}
<L>__{exterior pie shop day}
<A>__{mrs. lovett's wretched establishment has been transformed! she has created a modest outdoor eating garden with tables, surrounded by glowing chinese lanterns. a fresh coat of paint, a few bushes in pots and birds in cages add to the feeling of upward mobility. a new sign hangs proudly over the entrance to the pie shop: "mrs. lovett's world famous meat pies!" and then in smaller letters: "like mother used to make." the eating garden is already crowded, the benches at the tables are filled and other customers stand and mill about. all eating, eating, eating... ...the most delicious looking meat pies you could ever imagine. crispy crust. thick, luxurious gravy. tart and tangy meat. the customers take great, hungry mouthfuls; the steaming gravy oozing down greedy faces. chomp. chomp. chomp. the beggar women stands across the street, ravenously hungry. she finally gets the nerve to approach when toby wearing a spiffy new outfit with apron bursts from the shop and circulates through the customers:}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, may i have your attention, perlease? are your nostrils aquiver and tingling as well at that delicate, luscious ambrosial smell? yes they are, i can tell...}
<A>__{he moves through the greedily eating customers in the outdoor garden and toward the street as:}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{well, ladies and gentlemen, that aroma enriching the breeze is like nothing compared to its succulent source, as the gourmets among you will tell you, of course.}
<A>__{he arrives at the street and drums up some more business:}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, you can't imagine the rapture in store }
<P>__{(indicating the pie shop)}
<D>__{just inside of this door! there you'll sample mrs. lovett's meat pies, savory and sweet pies, as you'll see. you who eat pies, mrs. lovett's meat pies conjure up the treat pies used to be!}
<A>__{just then mrs. lovett sweeps from the pie shop with a tray of hot, steaming pies. like her shop, she has been transformed as well. she wears her somewhat gauche notion of a "fancy dress." buckets of decolletage. and her hair has been dyed a rather unique aubergine color.}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{toby!}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{coming!}
<P>__{(pushing past a customer)}
<D>__{'scuse me...}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<P>__{(indicating a beckoning customer)}
<D>__{ale there!}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{right, mum!}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{quick, now!}
<A>__{the customers suddenly exclaim their joy through awkward mouthfuls of pie:}
<C>__{customers}
<D>__{god, that's good!}
<A>__{toby scurries inside to get a jug of ale, whisks back out and starts filling tankards as mrs. lovett circulates grandly. she is a bundle of activity serving pies, collecting money, giving orders, addressing the patrons individually and with equal buoyant insincerity:}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{nice to see you, dearie... how have you been keeping?... cor, me bones is weary! toby !}
<P>__{(indicating a customer)}
<D>__{one for the gentleman... hear the birdies cheeping helps to keep it cheery...}
<A>__{she spots the beggar woman approaching and responds with unusual ferocity:}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{toby! throw the old woman out!}
<C>__{customers}
<D>__{god, that's good!}
<A>__{toby shoos the beggar woman away, but she soon comes skulking back.}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<P>__{(continuing to customers)}
<D>__{what's your pleasure, dearie?... no, we don't cut slices... cor, me eyes are bleary!...}
<P>__{(as toby is about to pour for a drunken customer)}
<D>__{toby! none for the gentleman!... i could up me prices i'm a little leery... business couldn't be better, though }
<C>__{customers}
<D>__{god, that's good!}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{knock on wood.}
<A>__{she does.}
