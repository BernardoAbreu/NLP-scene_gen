<L>__{interior exterior nick's sedan night}
<A>__{nick looks like hell his eyes red, his hair a mess. the nearly empty scotch bottle is on the dashboard. the car windows are open, the roar of the wind competing with the blasting radio. nick suddenly jerks the wheel over.}
<L>__{exterior abandoned rest stop continuous}
<A>__{the sedan screeches off the highway into the abandoned rest area. it stops facing a battered phone booth the engine turns off but the headlines stay shining on the phone booth.}
<B>__{in the sedan}
<A>__{nick turns off the radio. it is suddenly very quiet only the occasional lonely drone of a truck passing on the highway. he takes a deep breath.}
<L>__{interior phone booth moments later}
<A>__{nick is standing in the phone booth, harshly lit by his headlights.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(into the phone)}
<D>__{could you give me the number for information in arizona?... thank you.}
<A>__{nick dials with drunken concentration.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(into the phone)}
<D>__{enfield. carol, carol, umm...}
<P>__{(mortified)}
<D>__{carol... carol something... shit!}
<A>__{he hangs up. he hits himself in the head in angry disbelief. he hurriedly dials zero and listens for a moment, desperately summoning up all his salesman charm.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(into the phone)}
<D>__{hello janet, thank you for being my operator. i hope you can help me, i need to call my home.}
<A>__{nick listens impatiently.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{well, i will tell you my number, but there's a problem. my phone's been disconnected, not because of bills, i mean we paid all our bills. we were hardly ever even late. we were very good customers, but we're moving, so we had the phone disconnected. but now i need to call... the woman i live with. she's still there and i've got to let her know where i am.}
<A>__{nick listens, shaking his head emphatically.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i don't know any of the neighbors. i know one, but i can't remember her last name.}
<P>__{(he listens, frustrated)}
<D>__{no. no. no. you see you have to be able to help me, this is not a prank, it's my home phone, this is an emergency.}
<P>__{(he listens, then urgently)}
<D>__{yes it can, it can be done. someone there can hook the phone back up. it's not like a phone guy came to our house to disconnect the phone, nobody came to our house, someone just flipped a switch somewhere, somewhere there where you work, or plugged something into a computer and our phone stopped working!}
<P>__{(he listens)}
<D>__{they turned it off, they can turn it back on!}
<P>__{(he listens, starting to panic)}
<D>__{i know it's the week end! i know! call them at home! they'll have a computer at their house, they'll have a phone thing to hook it up to the real computer! that's how these people live! they'll be glad to do it!...}
<A>__{nick listens. suddenly all his energy drains away.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(crestfallen)}
<D>__{no. no. i can't have the police go to the house. that won't work, there are circumstances.}
<P>__{(desperately)}
<D>__{it's you... you've got to help me! please! i've gotta call home! i can't wait. it could be too late! janet!! you've gotta help me! please! you can reconnect me. please!! don't hang up! don't hang up!!}
<A>__{he hurls the receiver at the phone.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you fucker!! you heartless...}
<A>__{nick doubles over, retching, clutching the side of the booth.}
<C>__{telephone recording}
<D>__{"if you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again. if you need help..."}
