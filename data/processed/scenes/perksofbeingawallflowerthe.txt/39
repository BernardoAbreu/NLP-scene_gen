<L>__{interior gymnasium night}
<A>__{the homecoming dance is in full swing. god bless everyone. especially charlie. he's alone at the wall, dressed in his sunday suit. to us, adorable. to himself, in living hell. charlie watches his sister, slow dancing with derek. as happy as she looks, charlie still isn't sure if he did the right thing by keeping quiet. the song ends to applause. after a beat, charlie turns away. that's when he sees sam and patrick at the punch bowl. we hear the first notes of "come on, eileen" by dexy's midnight runners.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{oh, my god. they're playing good music.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{holy shit. they are! they're playing good music!}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(total mischief)}
<D>__{living room routine?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{living room routine!}
<A>__{charlie watches sam and patrick run to the center of the floor and show this stiff crowd what dancing is. it starts slow. "so over it" hand moves. a little shoulder. and then, the best of swing. 30 seconds of genius. charlie takes a breath. then, he tries desperately not to look like he's dancing toward them as he dances toward them. he bobs his head like a dork. and once he gets close, patrick and sam turn and find him.}
<D>__{sam & patrick hey!}
<A>__{without a pause, they grab his hands, and move together in a circle. their own island. after a moment, sam moves around charlie like a maypole as the whole gym explodes into dance.}
