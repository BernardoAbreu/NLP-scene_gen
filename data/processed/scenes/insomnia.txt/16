<A>__{ellie driving. a hula girl, swinging from the rear view mirror. will in the passenger seat. wearing a crisp suit. ellie hands him a take out bag.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{brought you a bear claw. just in case you were hungry.}
<A>__{will takes the bag. looks inside. yikes.}
<C>__{ellie }
<D>__{local delicacy.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{think i will pass.}
<A>__{he puts the bag on the dash. looks out the window. nightmute's main street. a line of shops. undistinguished town hall. elementary school up on a hill. sign out front: sign ups for midnight little league!}
<C>__{will }
<D>__{what kind of calls you get around here?}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{oh. you know. small time stuff. nothing like what you must get. mostly drinking related problems. domestic abuse. barroom fights. stuff like that.}
<A>__{she shifts down. takes a steep turn.}
<C>__{ellie }
<D>__{in the summer months it's pretty quiet. that's when there's work out on the boats. the rest of the year, though...}
<A>__{they pass a man walking along the road. gnarled walking stick. ellie calls out the window.}
<C>__{ellie }
<D>__{hey, there, joe!}
<A>__{joe waves. they pass.}
<C>__{ellie }
<D>__{that's joe willy. took his family hostage in november. that was the most exciting thing that happened last year. i wasn't there, though.}
<P>__{(grinds gear)}
<D>__{chief barely lets me handle anything above a misdemeanor.}
<A>__{will looks over at her. smiles.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{but they're so boring. all small stuff.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{it's all about the small stuff. small lies. small mistakes. small oversights. people give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case. it's human nature.}
<A>__{he looks over. ellie's listening intently.}
<C>__{will }
<D>__{aren't you going to write that down?}
<A>__{ellie, searching her pockets for something to write with...}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{let me just...}
<A>__{stops. looks over. realises will's teasing her.}
