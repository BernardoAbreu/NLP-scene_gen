<L>__{120 feet...}
<A>__{jacques gets undressed and sits down in the lotus position, concentrating... johana sits down a few feet away and watches him, wondering just how far he is going to push this whole thing. as the cable unrolls, johana starts crying. she understands that jacques is going to dive to the bottom, into the blue, into himself.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{jacques, you know i love you.}
<A>__{jacques is putting on his flippers, and stands facing his gueuse.}
<C>__{jacques}
<P>__{(after a silence)}
<D>__{don't be sad... it's not because of you, it's me. it's all going on inside me!}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{i've gotta go and see.}
<A>__{johana starts pacing up and down the diving platform.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{see what? there is nothing to see! it's pitch black down there! it's cold. you'll be all alone! look at me, jacques! i am here! i exist! look!!!}
<P>__{(she starts waving her arms)}
<D>__{i'm real! i am not a dream! jacques will you look at me?}
<P>__{(she breaks down)}
<D>__{please!}
<A>__{jacques has not moved, he still sits motionless, facing his gueuse. johana doesn't know what to do or say. she is totally drained.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{jacques? i'm pregnant.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{that's good... that's wonderful. it's wonderful for you.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{you are the father.}
<A>__{silence. jacques is petrified, without any reaction. he doesn't understand. she realizes it's hopeless and stares at the sea.}
<C>__{johana}
<P>__{(after a while)}
<D>__{i lied... to keep you here.}
<A>__{she kisses him.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{promise me one thing.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{anything.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{promise you won't forget me.}
<A>__{she pulls the line releasing the gueuse. jacques takes a deep breath and grabbing hold of the gueuse, disappears into the water as if swallowed by the ocean.}
<B>__{underwater}
<A>__{jacques slides along the cable, pulled by the weight of the gueuse. he has a beautiful smile on his face. he is in his element. night has closed in around him. he turns on the headlight of the gueuse, it casts a dim light around him.}
