<L>__{interior formica's chambers night}
<A>__{a nervous weaver is sitting across from formica, flanked by a couple of stoic guards. carpenter stands smiling by the side door. there is no obvious threat to weaver, but the atmosphere is truly intimidating.}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{so this z...he fancies himself an individual?}
<C>__{weaver}
<D>__{yeah...i mean...well...i don't know, really, sir.}
<C>__{formica}
<P>__{(patronizing)}
<D>__{well now you haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?}
<C>__{weaver}
<D>__{oh, no, sir!}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{good. you're a good soldier.}
<C>__{weaver}
<D>__{thank you, sir.}
<A>__{weaver begins to relax a bit.}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{so tell me. where's z?}
<C>__{weaver}
<D>__{i...i have no idea, sir.}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{okay, son.}
<A>__{he pats weaver on the shoulder.}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{we know what makes an ant colony strong, don't we? we know that no ant can be an individual. no single ant matters, right?}
<C>__{weaver}
<P>__{(enthusiastically)}
<D>__{that's correct, sir!}
<C>__{formica}
<P>__{(points at a guard)}
<D>__{not that one.}
<P>__{(another guard)}
<D>__{or that one.}
<C>__{weaver}
<D>__{no, sir!}
<A>__{formica nods at carpenter, who smiles and opens a door. two soldiers walk in, holding azteca. the color drains from weaver's face.}
<C>__{formica}
<P>__{(calmly, with satisfaction)}
<D>__{or that one? her life doesn't matter, does it?}
<C>__{azteca}
<D>__{don't tell that tightass anything, weaver!}
<A>__{weaver starts to get up, but the guards behind him hold him down.}
<C>__{weaver}
<D>__{wait! just let her go! z's long gone anyway, following some golden egg to insectopia! you'll never catch him!}
<A>__{formica's face lights up.}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{insectopia, hunh?...see why individuality is so dangerous? it can always be used against you.}
<P>__{(to the guards)}
<D>__{if this sissy here wants to dig, he'll dig. send them both back to the tunnel project. double their workload.}
<A>__{the guards exit with weaver and azteca.}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{what do we have on this "insectopia"?}
<C>__{carpenter}
<D>__{scattered reports, sir. rumors. nothing reliable.}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{desperate times call for desperate measures. get me ant team six.}
<C>__{carpenter}
<P>__{(frightened)}
<D>__{ant team six...}
