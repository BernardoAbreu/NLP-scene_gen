<L>__{interior dagobah tree cave}
<A>__{luke moves into the almost total darkness of the wet and slimy cave. the youth can barely make out the edge of the passage. holding his lit saber before him, he sees a lizard crawling up the side of the cave and a snake wrapped around the branches of a tree. luke draws a deep breath, then pushes deeper into the cave. the space widens around him, but he feels that rather than sees it. his sword casts the only light as he peers into the darkness. it is very quiet here. then, a loud hiss! darth vader appears across the blackness, illuminated by his own just ignited laser sword. immediately, he charges luke, saber held high. he is upon the youth in seconds, but luke sidesteps perfectly and slashes at vader with his sword. vader is decapitated. his helmet encased head flies from his shoulders as his body disappears into the darkness. the metallic banging of the helmet fills the cave as vader's head spins and bounces, smashes on the floor, and finally stops. for an instant it rests on the floor, then it cracks vertically. the black helmet and breath mask fall away to reveal... luke's head. across the space, the standing luke gasps at the sight, wide eyed in terror. the decapitated head fades away, as in a vision.}
