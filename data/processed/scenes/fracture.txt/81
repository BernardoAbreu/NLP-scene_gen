<A>__{willy stands at the prosecution table. hearing his own pulse. crawford studies willy, curious.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{your honor? can we signal the prosecutor from here on planet earth?}
<A>__{willy's fingertip hovers over the cell phone keypad. press, and a path is chosen. possibly for life. next to the cell phone, the ticket and the note. see you tomorrow. nunally sits forward. lobruto is watching intently. willy doesn't move.}
<C>__{judge robinson}
<D>__{mr. slocum? now or never.}

<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{even a broken clock gets to be right twice a day.}
<A>__{he winks, and heads up the aisle. as willy watches crawford go out the doors into a clamor of lenses, hand held mikes, white hot halogen glare and flashes he hears a buzzing noise. looks down at his briefcase, moves the papers aside: his cell phone is vibrating. willy stares at it, as if he'd forgotten the thing could be used for an incoming call. the caller id reads: wooton sims. he picks up }
