<A>__{up ahead max signals the group to halt. he beams his flashlight into the obscurity just as a predator emerges from the darkness. max begins firing. but the predator also shoots. materializing in mid air before max is a steel net. it knocks max off his feet and envelops him.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{aaaaaah!}
<A>__{the net is pulling ever tighter around him. the steel mesh cuts into max's clothing and equipment, slicing through metal like it were paper. weyland struggles with the net, but lacerates his own hands. the mesh is razor sharp. sebastian tries to cut at the net with a knife, but the blade just snaps against the strength of the predator steel.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{look out!}
<A>__{a second cloaked predator appearing suddenly behind sebastian and weyland. they react, but max's warning came too late. lex and weyland are sent crashing to the floor. the predator grabs sebastian by the throat and lifts him off the ground, choking the life out of him. with his other hand, the predator raises a spear high above max, ready to finish him off. lex reaches for her ice axe that is wrapped around her belt but the first predator is too fast. he backhands lex, sending her flying through the air. lex lands hard. the wind knocked out of her. she tries to struggle to her feet, but within seconds the predator is on her again. a savage kick sends lex back to the ground. max is held fast in the ever tightening net. he shares a look with weyland, only a foot away from him, winded and helpless on the ground.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{max!}
<A>__{it's the last words max hears, as the predator drives his spear clear through the net. the force is so great, the spear embeds itself in the rock floor beneath max. lex witnesses max's death. sebastian looks to be next in line. he's helpless, being choked to death by the second predator. just moments from losing consciousness.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{sebastian...}
<A>__{but there's nothing lex can do. for she too is about to die. close up: on the twin blades sliding from the first predator's wrist. even in cloaked mode, the razor sharp edges seem to catch the light. the predator brings the twin blades up above lex's head. she is just seconds from being decapitated. lex tenses, ready for the blow. but it never comes. instead, the predator convulses. its cloaking device begins to spark, and the predator starts to become visible. the sparking spreads out from the predator's chest as he is lifted into the air! blood drips onto the face of lex. green, luminescent predator blood. as the creature hanging above her slowly becomes visible, lex sees that something has impaled the predator. a wicked barbed tail sticks straight through the predator's chest. slowly, an alien unfolds from its hiding place in the ceiling. it has stabbed the predator, the sharp point of its tail going clean through the predator's armored chest. and now the second predator registers the alien. he tosses sebastian to one side, no longer interested. he has set his sights on big game. as if to mirror the actions of the second predator, the alien tosses aside the dead predator hanging from its tail. as sebastian and lex crawl away, the predator uncloaks and the two fearsome alien warriors face off. there is a long moment of tense anticipation, and then the two creatures charge! for the first time ever we witness a predator and an alien go head to head! the two beasts meet with a mighty impact. the alien's tail stabs at the predator. he deflects it with his twin wrist blades, and they slice clean through the tail. the alien howls in pain. the predator tries to stab the alien, but the twin blades have been reduced to smoldering stumps by the alien's acid blood. lex and sebastian pick up weyland and carry him between them as they make their escape. in the background, the two mighty beasts grapple, rolling end over end. the twin mouths of the alien snap at the predator's faceplate. he holds the alien off, the teeth of the inner mouth barely inches away from his eyes. the predator flings the alien off. gaining a moment's grace. the alien is clearly stronger than he had ever imagined. the alien charges again. the predator fires a steel net that arcs through the air and envelops the alien bringing it crashing to the ground. the net pulls tight, cutting through the alien's armored hide.}
