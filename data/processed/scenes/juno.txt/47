<L>__{interior loring house mark's "special" room day}
<A>__{the walls are plastered with framed posters of early 90s alt rock bands. (mudhoney, jane's addiction etc.) mark removes his les paul from its moorings and hands it to juno.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{it's beautiful. i've always liked gibson better than fender.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{what do you play?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i rock a harmony.}
<C>__{mark}
<P>__{(holding back a chuckle)}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{what? i'm a pawn shop rocker.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{sorry. i swear i'm not a gear snob.}
<A>__{juno turns the guitar over, examining it closely.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{what is that, mahogany? what happens if you crack the neck?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{tell me about it. i used to play in a really tight band back when i lived in chicago, and one night we opened for the melvins... do you know who the melvins are?}
<C>__{juno}
<P>__{(lying)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{well, we were playing with them and i busted this guitar onstage. it cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{when was this, like '96?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{'93. i'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{nuh uh, 1977! punk volume 1. you weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you weren't even alive!}
