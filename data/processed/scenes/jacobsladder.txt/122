<L>__{interior city college lecture hall day}
<T>__{cut to :}
<A>__{a huge ampitheatre style lecture hall at city college. it is almost empty. no more than forty students are scattered near the front of nearly three hundred seats. all are listening to professor emanuel stern who is nearing the end of his lecture.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{thus at the core of today's discu sion we find four fundamental doc trines. first, that the world of matter and individual consciousness are both manifestations of one divine reality.}
<A>__{one of the students seems about to fall asleep and keeps nodding his head.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{even you, mr. palmer, are part of it, as amazing as that may seem.}
<A>__{mr. palmer sits up quickly in his seat as other students smile.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{second, human beings are capable not only of kowledge about this divine re ality by inference but can realize its existence by direct intuition, superior even to reason.}
<A>__{a door opens in the upper reaches of the lecture hall. jacob enters and walks quietly down the stairs to within hearing range of the professor.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{third, man possesses a double nature, an ego and an eternal self, what we call "spirit" or "soul."}
<A>__{jacob takes a seat at one of the desks. there is a pencil lying on it which he fingers distractedly.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{fourth, and most important, man's life on earth has only one end and purpose, to learn to let go of the separate ego and to identify with the divine spark within.}
<A>__{mr. palmer is nodding off again.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{almost impossible to believe, isn't it mr. palmer, that somewhere in that unconscious head of yours lies the source of all consciousness?}
<C>__{palmer}
<D>__{yes, sir. very hard.}
<C>__{stern}
<P>__{(nodding his head)}
<D>__{well now, having reached this apotheosis there seems little, if anything, left to say. so rather than try, you are dismissed.}
<A>__{the students seem surprised but not unhappy with the sudden dismissal. they quickly gather their books and begin the long climb to the exits. only jacob remains seated.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{hello prof.}
<A>__{professor stern looks up and stares at kacob for several seconds before recognizing him.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{my oh my. doctor singer. isn't this a happy surprise?}
<A>__{jacob comes down the aisle and clasps hands with his old}
<B>__{professor.}
<C>__{stern}
<P>__{(looking at jacob's uni form)}
<D>__{are you in the service?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{the postal service. i'm a mailman.}
<C>__{stern}
<P>__{(surprised but non judgemental)}
<D>__{ah. neither snow nor sleet, nor dark of night ... i always admired that.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{it's good to see you.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{likewise.}
