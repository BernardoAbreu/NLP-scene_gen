<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{the outer part of the bar again}
<A>__{a silhouetted figure appears in the entrance doorway. the word "chill" races from table to table and the place falls still. the bartender pushes a button behind the bar and a buzzer goes off in the back room. boudreau gets up from his table and opens a small viewing port in the door. the silhouetted figure is now walking slowly past the silent tables. it's snyder and he's checking out every face in the place.}
<C>__{boudreau}
<D>__{twist, you know this guy?}
<C>__{twist}
<P>__{(taking a look through the viewing port)}
<D>__{no. never saw him before. he's a dick, though.}
<A>__{snyder walks all the way to the back, and then retraces his route. about halfway back, he stops at one of the tables, recognizing a grifter he knows. it's the eirie kid.}
<C>__{eirie kid}
<D>__{hello, snyder. what are you doin' up here?}
<C>__{snyder}
<D>__{i'm on vacation. you seen your friend lately?}
<C>__{eirie kid}
<D>__{yeh, he packed it in and enrolled in detective school.}
<A>__{snyder, in no mood for jokes, grabs eirie by the hair and slams his face into the table. eirie just stays there; he knows it doesn't pay to assault a detective. twist is watching all this intently from the viewing port.}
<C>__{snyder}
<D>__{you see him, you tell him to pay his debts before i get him.}
<A>__{eirie raises his head slowly, but says nothing. there is a slight trickle of blood from his nose. snyder turns and walks slowly out of the bar. when he is a safe distance down the street, the chatter and drinking resume.}
