<D>__{if you're thinking about doing something stupid, remember i just killed gino marzzone. you understand what that means?}
<A>__{she nods.}

<D>__{they're just cops.}
<A>__{there is another knock, much louder. violet goes to the door as caesar rips off his blood soaked jacket and shirt. he drops down behind the bar leaving the chain on, violet opens the door. tbe cops smile.}
<D>__{cop #1 see? we're for real.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i'm sorry, it's just you hear stories. cop #1 you did the right thing.}
<A>__{crouching, caesar wipes vigorously at the blood on his hands and face. violet opens the door. caesar crams the bloody wad under the bar sink. just as the cops enter the living room, caesar stands, looking comfortable in no shirt, with ice cubes in his hands.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{hey, hey, chicago's finest.}
<A>__{he plunks the ice into a glass and walks from behind the bar}
