<A>__{they leave, closing the door behind them. they see a security patrol car drive by, and jump in some bushes. the patrol car stops and flashes a light around the bushes. rebecca and marc freeze in their hiding spot. marc is freaking out, he thinks this is it for him. he tries to breath quietly. rebecca calmly waits. finally the flashing lights stop, and the car moves on. marc and rebecca sit in the dark, marc breaths again. they wait for a while.}
