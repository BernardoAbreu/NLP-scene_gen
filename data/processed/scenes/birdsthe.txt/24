<A>__{high shot the brenner house the place is decorated with balloons strung from the house to various points on the lawn. the children, in party clothes, with their parents, are clustered around a long folding table upon which are sandwiches, ice cream and soft drinks. the parents are either helping the children to more or telling them they are having too much. there is a general sound of kid's chatter and laughter. coming up the sloping path, away from the party, are melanie and mitch. the camera pans them up the slope and away from the party in background. as they turn the hairpin bend of the slope, and come up toward the camera, we see the entrance of the harbor and the pacific in the background. the camera pans them as they come near to us and, once more, the party is in the background. mitch and melanie pass the camera out to the left. closer shot the top of the dunes melanie and mitch come into the picture from the right and stand against the sky. mitch takes a martini shaker from one of his pockets, and two glasses from the other. he hands one of the glasses to melanie, and then pours.}
