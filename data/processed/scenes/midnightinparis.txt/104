<A>__{gil is sprucing up. he douses himself with aftershave, checks clock. it's eleven pm.}
<C>__{gil}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{eleven let's see where the hell am i going to get earrings at this hour?}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{i must improvise.}
<A>__{he goes to inez's jewelry box and picks out art nouveau earrings he knows adriana would like. he grabs a box and gift wraps it quickly. maybe it comes in a blue velvet box and he finds some colored paper. gil writes card: to adriana with love. he crosses it out to adriana avec amour. he gives a final check to himself and opens door to leave, running smack into inez and both her parents, home from their trip prematurely.}

<C>__{gil}
<D>__{you didn't like the moonstones? they're understated yet elegant }
<P>__{(to helen)}
<D>__{don't you always say that, ha, ha ..}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{cheap is cheap is what i always say.}
<C>__{inez}
<D>__{you never saw the necklace he got me. i've never actually worn it. you'll see why immediately.}
<A>__{opens her jewelry box, holds up moonstones.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{i thought you'd like their simplicity.}
<C>__{inez}
<D>__{that's just it, they're too simple.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i agree.}
<C>__{inez}
<D>__{hey where are my art nouveau earrings?}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{you probably didn't pack them.}
<C>__{inez}
<D>__{i've worn them here.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{i guess you lost them. they probably dropped off.}
<C>__{inez}
<D>__{both of them? my ears are pierced.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i told you to keep everything in the hotel safe.}
<C>__{inez}

<D>__{it's always the maid.}
<C>__{inez}
<D>__{i remember seeing them there this morning.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i would report the theft right away.}
<C>__{inez}
<D>__{i will bet it was that maid. she was so snotty yesterday about turning out the beds.}
<A>__{she goes to phone.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{gee i wouldn't jump to any conclusions. i mean an accusation of theft.}
<C>__{inez}
<P>__{(phone)}
<D>__{i want to report a theft. i'd like the house detective to please come to room 818.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{oh god }
<C>__{inez}
<P>__{(hangs up)}
<D>__{i didn't like that maid from the first day, didn't i say that?}
<A>__{door rings.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{the maid was very sweet.}
<C>__{inez}
<P>__{(opening door, doctor is there)}
<D>__{right. take the side of the help as usual. that's why dad calls you a communist.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{i'm dr. gerard.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{come in he's right there}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i'm fine.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{he's had an angioplasty.}
<A>__{amidst the ad lib moment, gil has managed to secure a private spot and has swiped the box. he's torn it open and removing earrings, runs into the room with them.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{look! look! are these what you're missing?}
<C>__{inez}
<D>__{where did you find them?}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{they were in the bathroom.}
<C>__{inez}
<D>__{the bathroom?}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{right out on the sink.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i was in the bathroom, i didn't see them.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{well you're under stress}
<C>__{inez}
<D>__{why the hell would they be in the bathroom?}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{maybe you thought you put them away and left them out or dropped them, and the maid found them and left them out where you could see them easily.}
<C>__{inez}
<D>__{i didn't drop them or leave them out ...}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{the main thing is they're not stolen.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{i'm going to send you for some tests but i think that you are right and this is only indigestion.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{see. incidentally, it was very nice of you to come over so late.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{yes my god, is it midnight already?}
<A>__{gil is disappointed.}
