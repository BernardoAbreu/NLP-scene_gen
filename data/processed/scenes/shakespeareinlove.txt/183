<L>__{interior the curtain theatre. the inner curtain stage. day.}
<A>__{the inner curtain opens, but will and viola, are in a play of their own...embracing and kissing passionately, making their own farewell. henslowe is too stunned and moved to react at first. then he looks at the audience and the penny drops. it's a hit.}
<L>__{interior the curtain theatre. auditorium stage. day.}
<A>__{the audience roars. will, viola, and the company come forward to meet the applause. tilney and his men burst in. tilney jumps up onto the stage, where the admiral's men are taking their bows. tilney's "cops" ring the stage, facing inwards.}
<C>__{tilney}
<P>__{(shouts triumphantly)}
<D>__{i arrest you in the name of queen elizabeth!}
<A>__{the audience goes quiet. burbage jumps out of the audience onto the stage.}
<C>__{burbage}
<D>__{arrest who, mr. tilney?}
<C>__{tilney}
<D>__{everybody! the admiral's men, the chamberlain's men and everyone of you ne'er do wells who stands in contempt of the authority invested in me by her majesty.}
<C>__{burbage}
<D>__{contempt? you closed the rose i have not opened it.}
<A>__{tilney is at a loss but only for a moment.}
<C>__{tilney}
<P>__{(he points a "j'accuse" finger at viola)}
<D>__{that woman is a woman!}
<A>__{the entire audience and the actors, recoil and gasp. the nurse crosses herself.}
<C>__{alleyn}
<D>__{what?! a woman?! you mean that goat?!}

<C>__{tilney}
<D>__{i will see you all in the clink! in the same of her majesty queen elizabeth}
<A>__{and an authoritative voice from the audience interrupts him.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{mr. tilney...!}
<A>__{it is queen elizabeth herself, descending now, her hood and cloak thrown back. she is an awesome sight. a shaft of sunlight hits her.}
<C>__{queen}
<D>__{have a care with my name, you will wear it out.}
<A>__{there is a general parting of the waves, soldiers and actors, a general backing off and bowing as queen elizabeth takes the limelight.}
<C>__{queen }
<D>__{the queen of england does not attend exhibitions of public lewdness so something is out of jointerior come here, master kent. let me look at you.}
<A>__{viola comes forward, and is about to curtsey when she catches the queen's eye, an arresting eye, which arrests the curtsey and turns it into a sweeping bow.}
<C>__{queen }
<D>__{yes, the illusion is remarkable and your error, mr. tilney, easily forgiven, but i know something of a woman in a man's profession, yes, by god, i do know about that. that is enough from you, maser kent. if only lord wessex were here.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{he is, ma'am.}
<A>__{the voice belongs to john webster. he points firmly at a figure in the audience, wessex, trying to look inconspicuous.}

<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{your majesty}
<C>__{queen}
<D>__{there was a wager, i remember...as to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. i think you lost it today.}

<D>__{you are an eager boy. did you like the play?}
<C>__{webster}
<D>__{i liked it when she stabbed herself, your majesty.}
<A>__{the queen fixes will with a beady eye.}
