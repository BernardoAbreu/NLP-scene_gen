<D>__{can you sing, master hobbit?}
<C>__{pippin}
<P>__{(uneasy)}
<D>__{well . . . yes, at least, well enough for my own people ... but we have no songs for great halls and evil times . . . we seldom sing of anything more terrible than wind or rain.}

<D>__{and why should your songs be unfit for my halls, or for hours such as these. come sing me a song!}
<A>__{pippin's simple, clear voice echoes through the vast hall.}
<D>__{pippin v 0 home is behind, the world ahead, and there are many paths to tread. through shadow to the edge of night until the stars are all alight. mist and shadow, cloud and shade: all shall fade, all shall fade.}
