<A>__{retrofitted into a makeshift press area. victor sits on a platform, with reporters stretched out below him.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{today we stand on the edge of a new frontier. in the furthest depths of outer space...we will find the secrets to inner space. the final key to unlocking our genetic code lies in a cosmic storm...}
<A>__{behind the action: reed, sue, johnny and ben walk past. news crews barely notice, passing without even taking a picture. our "fantastic four" are not exactly big news. not yet.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{isn't that your speech?}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{he's made a few changes.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{this is your dream, reed. you should be the one up there.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{victor's better at these things.}
<A>__{just past the press area, they see...one woman standing, waiting. this is debbie, ben's fiancee. and for the first time in the entire film...ben smiles. they hug, kissing. johnny and reed watch. reed glances at sue, who walks ahead. debbie slips a photo into ben's flightsuit. a tender beat.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i will be watching over you.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{just get back soon, or i start looking for a new groom.}
<A>__{ben looks at the little engagement ring on her finger.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{soon as i'm back, i'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{i don't care about rocks, i care about you.}
<P>__{(to reed)}
<D>__{you bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being best man.}
<A>__{reed nods, smiles. debbie gives ben a last kiss. ben turns to johnny, who gives a cocky smile.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what the hell you smiling at? just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those smbs }
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{actually, the engines are smes. hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. couple generations past your last ride.}
<P>__{(at the threshold)}
<D>__{i'm not as dumb as you look.}
<A>__{ben just glares at reed. this is going to be a long trip. as they follow after sue, we cut back to : }
<B>__{victor on stage}
<A>__{mid speech. playing behind him is reed's hologram: stars give way to a pulsating red cloud...}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{think of a world without genetic flaws no asthma, allergies, baldness, breast cancer...}
<A>__{ben and reed hear the speech. ben bristles.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what's wrong with being bald...?}
<A>__{victor smiles at the crowd, commanding. a true leader.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{darwin discovered evolution. now we i will define it. only in america could...}
<A>__{the red cloud of cosmic rays wash over the earth.}
<D>__{victor (v.o.) (cont'd) ...a little country boy from latveria build one of the biggest companies in the world, and truly reach the stars. now if you'll excuse me, history awaits...}
<A>__{on those words, the hologram transforms to...von doom's shuttle on the launch pad. boom! thrusters fire white hot. smoke billows across the pad. ready for take off. victor walks past the hologram and exits. his departure perfectly timed with the shuttle lifting off. we push in on the shuttle, and follow the ship as it leaves earth's atmosphere. boom booster rockets fall away and the shuttle fires its thrusters. the hologram transitions to... a shot of the space station high above the earth. the shuttle enters from the top, lighting up the hologram with engines afire. as the shuttle approaches the station we cut to }
