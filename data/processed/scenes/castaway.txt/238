<A>__{chuck checks the water. it is green and full of floaties. it looks awful. he takes the jug, puts it to his mouth, and drinks. instantly he throws up back into the jug, barely keeps from dropping it.}

<D>__{look what you've done.}
<A>__{he dips his hand into the ocean, splashes some sea water on his face, splutters it out, then licks his lips. he is so thirsty. he looks at the water jug, full now with his own vomit, turns away, begins to work on the sea anchor again. but the work makes him even thirstier. he looks at the jug again. picks it up. takes a long drink.}
