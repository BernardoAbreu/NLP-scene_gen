<C>__{mills}
<D>__{great.}
<A>__{mills puts the box on the large desk. they both settle in, attending to their work. two men, about five feet apart, each trying not to acknowledge the other's presence. mills takes out his cliff notes, looks to see somerset is occupied, hides them in a desk drawer. somerset finishes one form, flips it and looks up. there's a chalk board nailed to the wall. on the chalkboard: 1 gluttony(x) 5 wrath}
