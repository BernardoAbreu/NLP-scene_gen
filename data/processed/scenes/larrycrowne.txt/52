<L>__{exterior east city community college scooter parking lot }
<C>__{later}
<A>__{some of the scooter gang have assembled as larry and talia walk up. dell gordo and stan are talking about today's route.}
<C>__{talia}
<D>__{hey monkey!}
<A>__{dell gordo plants a kiss right on talia's lips. she kisses him back. larry sinks a little. it only figures talia would have a boyfriend like dell gordo.}
<C>__{talia }
<D>__{this is lance corona. classmate and good guy, so far.}
<C>__{dell gordo}
<D>__{dell gordo. you want to ride with us?}
<C>__{larry crowne}
<D>__{why not.}
<A>__{there is a beat of a stare down between dell gordo and larry, but then dell starts to snap his fingers snap...snap...snap... the other join in until they are all snapping fingers like the jets vs. sharks. talia too.}
<C>__{talia}
<D>__{snap along, lance or you can't join the gang.}
<A>__{larry, clumsily, starts snapping too. after a few bars...}
<C>__{dell gordo}
<D>__{okay. you're in for a trial run.}
<A>__{and just like that, everyone goes back to their wheels.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{not many of these '66 wasps left around. they had low torque. how's the torque?}
<A>__{he means larry's scooter.}
<C>__{larry crowne}
<D>__{i just bought it and ride around.}
<A>__{someone yells "saddle up!"}
<C>__{talia}
<D>__{stan knows engines and junk.}
<C>__{dell gordo}
<D>__{let's go, sweets!}
<C>__{talia}
<D>__{we ride, monkey!}
<A>__{larry's heart breaks a tiny bit, suffering as he does from talia on the heart. the squad pulls out through the cars of the parking lot with larry trying to speed his machine along with the crowd...}
<C>__{scoot montage}
<A>__{they roll through town a multi wheeled dance troupe. swaying... turning... slow motion sometimes... elegant always. they make riding look fun... being in a group a gas... rolling with the wind in your hair something you'd like to do...}
<C>__{unimart}
<A>__{as larry and the squad pass it by, larry can't help but eye the place he once worked. he sees staffers collecting carts in the parking lot. he misses that place...}
<C>__{later}
<A>__{after many shots, riders begin to peel off scooting done. talia waves at larry who guns his throttle and pulls even with her. talia (cont'd)}
<D>__{you good, lance?}
<C>__{larry crowne}
<D>__{other than school, i have nothing to do.}
<C>__{dell gordo}
<D>__{let's troll buena vista for junk stores.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{we hit those last week.}
<C>__{talia}
<D>__{if it was saturday we'd look for yard sales.}
<C>__{larry crowne}
<D>__{i know where a yard sale is, like everyday.}
<C>__{talia}
<D>__{lead the way.}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{monkey! lance knows a yard sale!}
<C>__{dell gordo}
