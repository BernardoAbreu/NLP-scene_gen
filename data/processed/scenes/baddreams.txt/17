<L>__{interior meeting room day}
<A>__{the room is cheery, commands a view of the city. a video camera sits unobtrusively in one corner. six people sit in chairs in various stages of interest and or boredom. they are miriam, an attractive woman in her forties, who chain smokes designer cigarettes; connie, smiling, chipper; ed, overweight, friendly; lana, pale, worried looking; and gilda, tiny, frightened, withdrawn. she sits with feet pulled up on her chair, arms wrapped around her knees. camera adjusts to show cynthia driving her electric wheelchair into the room and into a place in the circle. ralph stands. long haired, with the staccato delivery of a stand up comic, he smiles.}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{well, now that we're all here, we can begin. cynthia, i'm dr. goldman, and i'd like to welcome you to our little group. i don't know how much my colleague dr. berrisford has told you about my methods. i have my detractors... but i have my successes, too! we're going to get you out of your depression... we're going to got you out of your neurosises... we're going to got you out of that hideous hospital robe and into a flimsy revealing negligee one with the little holes here? i can see us now on a desert island... you, me, a portable waterbed }
<A>__{as cynthia's eyes widen, dr. alan goldman comes into the room, sighs with weary familiarity at ralph's antics. (actually, alan doesn't look much more like a doctor than ralph.)}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{ralph, sit down and cut out the shit, okay?}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{dr. goldman, i was on the verge of a major breakthrough, and you blew it!}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{ralph?}
<P>__{(when he sits)}
<D>__{cynthia. i'm doctor goldman at least, last time i checked...}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{and i doubt if my welcome can equal ralph's, but i will try. this is the borderline personality group. and you are now a card carrying member.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{what's a borderline personality?}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{don't ask him. he's making this up as he goes along.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{a borderline personality is one that can't be accurately placed on the neurosis psychosis arc. as a personality syndrome it encompasses identity crises, chemical addictions, emotionalism, anxiety }
<C>__{ralph}
<P>__{(standing, screaming like sam kinison)}
<D>__{you forgot violent mood swings!}
<A>__{he sits, smiles sweetly.}
<C>__{connie}
<D>__{he also forgot suicidal tendencies. but, as one whose previous reincarnations stretch back to ancient atlantis, well, suicide is meaningless anyway.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{and don't forgot binge eating.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{gourmet binge eating.}
<C>__{miriam}
<P>__{(sweetly, to cynthia)}
<D>__{i told you he was making this up.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{if everyone is finished }
<C>__{lana}
<P>__{(breaking in)}
<D>__{they're not finished, dr. goldman, they won't be finished until they have her feeling as miserable and pathetic and confused as they are.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i am confused }
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{see?}
<P>__{(to the group)}
<D>__{i hope you're all happy }
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{dr. goldman, i... i don't really know what i'm doing here. i mean... i don't think i meet your description of a borderline personality }
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{give yourself some time, cynthia. we'll help you work on it.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{ and i don't really know what i'm doing here.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{didn't dr. berrisford explain?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{he said he thought that this would help me... fit into the 80's.}
<A>__{miriam cracks up.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{honey, you want to fit into the 80's, you're already two divorces, one condo and a yeast infection behind. why don't you just catch up with the 70's and move to cleveland?}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{if i can offer a more practical suggestion... why don't you talk, cynthia?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{talk...?}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{about something close to you.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{stop beating around the fucking bush, goldman! just come out and ask her!}
<C>__{lana}
<P>__{(to miriam)}
<D>__{do you have to be so crude?}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{come on, cynthia. dish out the dirt. tell us all about unity house.}
<P>__{(gesturing a marquee)}
<D>__{the last gasp of the age of aquarius. building a better world through... what? chemistry? good vibrations? tie dying your undies?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i'm sorry to disappoint you. i don't have those kinds of stories.}
<C>__{ralph}
<D>__{back off, miriam. cynthia, just tell us about the orgies.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{ralph, i'm going to bore you.}
<A>__{she thinks for a minute, starts to speak. she's hesitant at first, and then the old memories come forward. she's sincere, earnest... captivating.}
<C>__{cynthia }
<D>__{what we felt... what we believed... was that if people could become selfless enough, if they could free themselves from their egos, they would experience a... togetherness. a... oneness. a unity. that's where the name came from. we had a dream about a perfect society based on trust. on love. on totally committed togetherness. we weren't trying to change the whole world. we were just trying to change each other.}
<A>__{pause. everyone is affected by her sincerity.}
<C>__{ralph}
<P>__{(acting out)}
<D>__{bullshit.}
<C>__{gilda}
<D>__{no.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{as everyone turns, astonished. gilda gets out of her chair, slowly walks towards cynthia. takes her hand. and smiles.}
<C>__{gilda }
<D>__{it's beautiful. it didn't matter if it worked. all that mattered was... you tried.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<P>__{(touched)}
<D>__{exactly!}
