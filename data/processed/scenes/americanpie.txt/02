<A>__{we see a honda accord drive by a sign at the city limits: "welcome to east great falls, michigan a great place to be"}
<L>__{exterior front of school day}
<A>__{the front of the school. kevin drives up in his accord. he's a good humored, good enough looking high school senior. vicky rides shotgun pretty, smart, confident. she's holding a large, thick envelope, with a big "vanderbilt" return address on it.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{it's a big, thick envelope, vicky. you got in.}
<C>__{vicky}
<D>__{you think so?}
<A>__{she tears it open. pulls out a course catalog, various forms, and a letter which she hands to kevin.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{"dear ms. hughes. we're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected. enclosed is a 100 page, full color brochure on how rejected you are."}
<C>__{vicky}
<D>__{kevin, this is serious!}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{you got in.}
<A>__{vicky screams in excitement, like a girl at a beatles concert. then she laughs, and gives kevin a big kiss and hug.}
<C>__{vicky}
<D>__{i love you!}
<A>__{she hugs kevin tighter as he looks a little frazzled, almost perfunctorily returning the hug.}
