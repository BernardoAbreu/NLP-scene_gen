<B>__{onstage}
<A>__{louis prima takes the mike his number has finished to much applause from the drunken crowd.}
<C>__{louis prima}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much, you're a great crowd ... i have been informed that we have a celebrity with us tonight who is a legend, a man who truly needs no introduction...}
<C>__{louis prima }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{... so let's give a harrah's casino warm welcome to the greatest baseball player of all time, the one and only ty cobb!}
<A>__{the spotlight flies to cobb who kisses ramona's hand. stump has been left out of the exchange, and mumbles.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{'moonlit garden of the gods'?}
<A>__{the audience stands to applaud cobb full and genuine. cobb graciously waves to the crowd, bowing, basking. back onstage louis prima motions to his band.}
<C>__{louis prima}
<D>__{and this one's for the georgia peach!}
<A>__{they break into "sweet georgia brown."}
<D>__{louis prima keely smith no gal made has got a shade on sweet georgia brown, two left feet but oh so sweet is sweet georgia brown...}
<A>__{cobb breaks into a little dance with ramona at the table, much to stump's (and ramona's) amazement. for a moment, at least, there is great footwork and lightness in his movement we get a glimpse of the great athlete he once was.}
<C>__{louis prima}
<D>__{the great ty cobb! c'mon up here!}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{they want you, ty }
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{of course they want me.}
<A>__{and cobb heads for the stage, walking better but not without effort, a walk enhanced by drugs and booze. as he does, ramona turns to stump.}
<C>__{ramona}
<D>__{who's that?}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{the greatest baseball player of all time.}
<C>__{ramona}
<D>__{i don't know baseball from shmaseball but i know a nice man when i see one and i also know it's time for my coffee break. hasta luego.}
<A>__{and she's off with her trayful of tobacco to the cocktail lounge.}
<B>__{back onstage}
<A>__{as cobb arrives...}
<C>__{louis prima and group}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{fellas, she can't get, are fellas, she ain't met, georgia made her, georgia claimed her, sweet georgia brown.}
<A>__{louis prima welcomes cobb to the mike to thunderous applause.}
<C>__{louis prima}
<D>__{my great pleasure, sir }
<P>__{(shaking hands)}
<D>__{i've always wanted to ask you something, mr. cobb, with all the great ballplayers playing right now how well do you think you'd do against today's players?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{well, i figure against today's pitchers i'd only hit about .275, .280...}
<C>__{louis prima}
<D>__{that's amazing, mr. cobb, considering your lifetime average is nearly a hundred points higher. why do you think you'd only hit .275 against today's pitchers?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{because i'm 72 fucking years old, that's why, god damn it. give me that thing.}
<A>__{cobb grabs the mike and takes over.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{first of all i wanta thank you for that song, 'sweet georgia brown... it's a great song about my home state and i appreciate it...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that song has become the theme song for the harlem globetrotters...}
<P>__{(as prima nods with a smile)}
<D>__{it's too bad such a fine song had to be stole by a buncha niggers playing a faggot game in their underwear...}
<A>__{prima and his cohorts are aghast. they cling to the hope that this is some put on, some joke. they force a small, unnatural laugh. stump winces and leaves the room, heading for the bar.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{'course the globetrotters are owned by a jew named saperstein so whadda you expect?}
<A>__{a disaster. prima tries gamely to seize the mike back.}
<C>__{louis prima}
<D>__{thank you very much. another round of applause for the georgia peach, ty cobb!}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{i got the mike, dago gimme a god damn minute. nobody's got respect for their elders any more.}
<A>__{cobb turns to the crowd which, even in it's drunken state, is appalled and in disbelief.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{now let me explain to you how to hit a baseball. it's a lost art. ever since that half nigger ruth started hitting home runs, the skill, the art, and the science have been lost.}
<A>__{cobb grabs a clarinet from a member of prima's band.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{now, say this is a bat...}
<B>__{backstage}
<A>__{the casino managers and security forces are quickly gathering to figure out what to do.}
<C>__{casino manager}
<D>__{let's just haul him off }
<C>__{security officer}
<D>__{that's ty cobb! he'll fucking kill me!}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{you see, the bat is like a wand, a magic wand... it should be caressed, held like a woman... like a woman who's really in need of a man...}
<B>__{offstage}
<A>__{the casino manager winces and consults.}
<C>__{casino manager}
<D>__{oh god, here we go...}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{hitting a baseball is really very easy... you can't force it... you can't overpower it... you go with the pitch... you let the bat do the work... it's all rhythm and flow...}
<A>__{and cobb starts demonstrating hitting techniques to the bewildered audience and casino staff. he strikes that familiar, strange stance choked up on the bat, a split grip, the bat held parallel to the ground...}
