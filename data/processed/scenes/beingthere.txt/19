<L>__{exterior garden morning}
<A>__{it has stopped snowing. chance, wearing a hat, the gardening apron over his suit and boots, putters in the garden. louise comes out of the main house. she is dressed warmly, a scarf over her head, a heavy coat. chance sees her, tips his hat to louise exactly like the man he saw on television.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{... well, ain't you the gentleman this mornin'...}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{... gotta go now, chance...}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(resumes working)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{you're gonna need somebody, someone's gotta be around for you, boy...}
<P>__{(he keeps working)}
<D>__{... you oughta find yourself a lady, chance...}
<P>__{(she smiles slightly, with caring)}
<D>__{but i guess it oughta be an old lady, 'cause you ain't gonna do a young one any good, not with that little thing of yours...}
<P>__{(she reaches out, puts a hand on his shoulder)}
<D>__{... you're always gonna be a little boy, ain't you?}
<P>__{(he smiles, keeps working)}
<D>__{... goodbye, chance...}
<A>__{louise gives his shoulder a squeeze, turns and moves toward the house.}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(as she goes)}
<D>__{goodbye, louise.}
<A>__{louise waves as she enters the townhouse. chance tips his hat once again as she disappears.}
