<A>__{paul's room. night. paul lies in bed listening to the strains of "the love connection," coming from upstairs. as chuck woolery drones on, paul is intently involved in folding a piece of paper from his pad. he is making a container of some sort. he finishes, then reaches down and grabs the novril capsules that he has been stashing in the mattress. carefully, he opens one and pours it into the palm of his hand. first he smells it no odor then he takes a tiny bit on a finger and tastes it no taste. then, he takes his paper container and empties the contents of all the pills into it, then places it under the mattress. now, what to do with the empty capsules. he thinks for a second, then what the hell he swallows them. he then places the packet back in the mattress.}
