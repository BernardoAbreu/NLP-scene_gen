<C>__{ed}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{snuffed her.}
<A>__{ed surprised at wilson's directness. ed stands nervously.}

<D>__{i never said nothin' about nothin' like that. no, no, no. that's not what i wrote to you.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{no, but between the lines, eh? mysterious circumstances, and that.}
<A>__{ed stops pacing.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{look, i sent you that newspaper clipping, all right? i told you what i know. it was an accident. i didn't say anything about anybody being "snuffed."}

<C>__{ed}
<D>__{valentine came into the restaurant where i work with jenny a couple times. he's a money guy. jenny would say, hey, here's my friend eddie and he would shake my hand and everything, but he wouldn't even see me, you know what i mean.}
<A>__{wilson gazes up at the sky. clear night. stars.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{how long had she been in the states?}
<P>__{(as if to himself, somewhat wistful)}
<D>__{near on ten years, wasn't it? long enough to know her way about, i reckon.}
<A>__{ed leans down, palms on the tabletop, facing wilson.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{there was an investigation, okay? the car was totalled. jennifer was ... her neck was broken. on impact, they said. so she wouldn't have ... felt the effects of the fire.}
<P>__{(helpless shrug)}
<D>__{it happens up there. happens a lot. what more can i tell you.}
<A>__{wilson taps out a cigarette from a pack of "silk cut" he's produced from his pocket.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{what more is there.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{i'm just sayin' it was a steep hillside. there was no moon that night ...}
<A>__{wilson's quiet stillness is getting to him.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{coulda happened to anyone, man. i never knew her to be reckless. i mean, sure, she would smoke a little grass, or something, have a few drinks. but that's it, nothing more than that.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{no, not my girl. self control, she had. point of pride.}
<P>__{(smokes)}
<D>__{and people don't change, do they.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{i dunno ... maybe they do.}
<A>__{wilson notes the tattoos on ed's forearms.}

<C>__{ed}
<D>__{i go to work, try to keep my life together, put all that shit behind me, man. what d'you want from me.}
<C>__{wilson}
<P>__{(calmly smoking)}
<D>__{i only asked.}
<A>__{ed sighs. reaches for one of wilson's cigarettes.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{couple weeks before she died, jennifer asked me to drive her downtown. said she was meeting her boyfriend valentine. but i think she was looking for him.}
