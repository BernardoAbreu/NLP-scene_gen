<A>__{frank and mary walking past the triage station toward the curtained corner where her father lies. next to burke, dr. hazmat assists an aids patient amid a forest of iv tubing. mr. burke lies prone, two iv lines hung from poles, intubated by a hose running to the ventilator, a ng tube covering his nose. his eyes are permanently half open. burke's hands and feet are tied by white nylon restraints. mary takes her father's hand as frank pulls the curtain.}

<D>__{dad, can you hear me?}
<P>__{(beat)}

<D>__{it's movement, but i'm not sure how voluntary.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{he hears me. open your eyes, dad.}
<A>__{burke's eyes fully open. his cheeks ripple and his lips smack against the tube between them. his back arches, his body shakes, his arms yank at their restraints as if reaching to pull out the wires and tubes. green lights dance across the ekg screen, alarms sound: first the cardiac monitor, next the ventilator.}
<C>__{hazmat}
<D>__{nurse crupp, i need ten milligrams of valium.}
<A>__{hazmat and milagros hold down burke's arms as crupp prepares the valium. mary backs away.}
