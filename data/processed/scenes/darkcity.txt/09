<L>__{interior cinema night}
<A>__{a watch on a hairy wrist. seconds tick past. soft flickering light. voices o.s. angle on frank bumstead police inspector. he looks down at the watch. time to leave. he stands, heads for an illuminated exit sign. images flicker on a screen. the inspector rushes to the door, runs into an usher, who gasps.}
<C>__{bumstead }
<D>__{gesundheit!}
<A>__{bumstead quickly moves off.}
<L>__{interior cinema lobby}
<A>__{the inspector makes a call, licks the tip of a pencil, scribbles in a notebook. behind thick glass, he argues soundlessly into a phone. big in foreground a popcorn machine rattles noisily.}
<B>__{inside the booth}
<A>__{the inspector is upset, face strained. a male voice chatters quickly through the receiver.}
<C>__{bumstead }
<D>__{...but you told me the meeting was ten thirty .}
<A>__{a burst of chatter.}
<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{i know, sir, but i can't make it at nine thirty ... it's um well, inconvenient...}
<A>__{a stream of chatter stops him.}
<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{yes, sir... i understand... yes... but, i've done fine so far without an assistant...}
<A>__{the inspector tries to interject as the voice cuts in again...}
<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{but... but i... i...}
<P>__{(defeated)}
<D>__{nine thirty. yes.}
