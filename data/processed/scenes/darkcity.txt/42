<L>__{interior empty building}
<A>__{a p.o.v. moves down halls made of wood slatting the floors, walls and ceilings are bare boards. footsteps o.s. tight on a manis shadow as it descends a wooden staircase. reveal white he rummages in a paper bag as he walks. pulls out two capsules, swallows them. now he pulls out a pack of "lump o", rips it open, eats ravenously.}
<L>__{exterior street night}
<A>__{white steps out into a street, turns a corner, drops the empty packet of cereal. now he sees two figures approach. he hides behind a wall before he is seen. suddenly a deafening ringing startles him. he looks across a plaza. his p.o.v. a church. a bell tower, black against the sky. white stares up into the night.}
