<L>__{interior "magik exhibition" hall night}
<A>__{blue emergency lamps are on. the exhibits are destroyed; piles of debris are burning. hellboy walks past a fallen display case. he moves around cautiously. a couple of large carvings and statues startle him. on the floor: boots, half chewed. bitten belts and shreds of uniforms and hats.}

<P>__{(whispers into radio)}
<D>__{blue: it stinks in here finely aged roadkill.}
<A>__{the sickening sound of snapping bones and mastication reaches his ears. hellboy reacts to a smell, raises his eyes to discover a huge pale creature hangs from the ceiling, chewing slowly. sammael: equipped with powerful arms, a head full of tentacles and two well muscled hind legs. most of its face is hidden, but the jaws are shiny with blood.}
