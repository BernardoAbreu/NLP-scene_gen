<A>__{a videocassette encased in the customary black box flips repeatedly, held by an impatient grasp. the impatient customer glares at dante. dante studies a copy of paradise lost, making a strong attempt at not noticing the glare.}

<P>__{(pissed off)}
<D>__{i thought that place was supposed to be opened at eleven o'clock? it's twenty after!}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i called his house twice already. he should be here soon.}
<C>__{impatient customer}
<D>__{it's not like it's a demanding job. i'd like to get paid to sit on my ass and watch tv. the other day i walked in there and that sonofabitch was sleeping.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i'm sure he wasn't sleeping.}
<C>__{impatient customer}
<D>__{you calling me a liar?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{no; he was probably just resting his eyes.}
<C>__{impatient customer}

<C>__{dante}
<D>__{actually, that's his night job.}
<C>__{impatient customer}
<D>__{such a wiseass. but go ahead. crack wise. that's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work.}

<D>__{if you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, i will have him hold it for you.}
<C>__{impatient customer}
<P>__{(storming out)}
<D>__{don't hurt yourself. i'm going to big choice video instead.}
<A>__{he storms out. dante lifts a ring of keys from the counter.}
