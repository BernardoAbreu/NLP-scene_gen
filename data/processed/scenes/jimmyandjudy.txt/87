<A>__{judy's on such a cloud nine high, she's almost in tears. she wraps her arms around him and squeals with delight, pushing the camera into an awkward position as she smothers him with kisses, then squeezes him tight, like she's going to squeeze the life out of him. she whispers in his ear.}

<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{i love you jimmy.}
