<A>__{later. dinner is over. jeremy comes out onto the veranda carrying two cuban cigars. his casual outfit is as stylish and pricey as his work outfit. he joins mumford and althea, who immediately gets up.}

<D>__{i will be back.}
<A>__{she goes inside. the men each have a snifter of cognac. jeremy makes a ceremony of cutting the cigars }

<D>__{i think you'll like this. know much about cuban cigars?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{nope.}
<A>__{jeremy puts the cigars down, pulls a joint out of his cashmere pullover and fires it up. after exhaling a huge cloud of smoke, he offers the joint to mumford, who declines.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{makes the whole thing that much better.}
<A>__{jeremy takes another hit on the joint and puts it down. he gives a cigar and his gold lighter to mumford, who begins to light up }
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{just hold the flame a little bit below the end... that's it... now just turn it slowly as you draw...}
<A>__{mumford does as he's told. jeremy lights his own cigar.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{are you a man who likes to treat himself right?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{i've had my moments.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{i am. and i'm not ashamed of it. nobody ever said on their death bed "i treated myself too well."}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{i thought it was nobody ever said, "i should have spent more time at the office."}

<P>__{(no)}
<D>__{we've been talking about her, mostly.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. we've got twenty three people working there now.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{you've done well.}
<A>__{the marijuana is kicking in now jeremy gets a self satisfied, condescending look on his face that no straight mind would dare. his response includes their lavish immediate surroundings }
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{we've done... very well. you know anything about addiction, doc?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{a little.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{well, i'm addicted to winning. i say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score.}

<D>__{she's gone weird is what's wrong with her. out of control. probably from living out here in mayberry.}
<A>__{jeremy blows cigar smoke into his snifter, then takes a mouthful of cognac, savoring the sensations. mumford watches, fascinated by this guy.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{you're the doctor, what do you think?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{she seems very unhappy.}
<A>__{jeremy gives him a look, as if to say "duh."}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{i think we all knew that, professor. the question... the real }
