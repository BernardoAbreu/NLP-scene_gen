<L>__{interior the quality cafe day}
<A>__{the quality cafe is enid and rebecca' s hangout. a 50 ish man with shaved head, and his vaguely diabolical wife sit eating lunch. enid is drawing a picture of them in her sketchbook when rebecca arrives.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{look at these people behind you. i'm totally convinced they're satanists.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{just look at them!}
<A>__{rebecca turns and makes eye contact with mr. satanist. she calmly turns back to face enid before cracking up.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{so, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{soon... i have to wait and see how this summer class goes.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{did you sign up yet?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{yeah, i just picked the one that sounded the easiest.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{god, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... we've been waiting for this our whole life! now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want. it's such a weird feeling.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{i know, it hasn't really hit me yet.}
<A>__{enter john ellis, an obnoxious young man with a perpetual smirk.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{well, if it isn't enid and rebecca, the little jewish girl and her aryan friend.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{you're late, asshole.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{fine, and how are you?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{did you bring that tape?}
<A>__{he puts a videotape on the table, just out of reach.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you never paid me for that tape with the indian dance routine.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{i did too!}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{tsk! you jews are so clever with money...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{hey, look, the satanists are leaving!}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{we should follow them!}
<A>__{as the satanists walk outside, they open umbrellas, even though it's a bright, sunny day.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{totally... oh my god, look!}
<A>__{the girls get up to follow them. enid grabs the videotape.}
<C>__{enid}
<P>__{(to john)}
<D>__{thanks for the tape i will have to pay you later, i'm broke.}
<C>__{john}
