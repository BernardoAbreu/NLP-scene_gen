<LOC>__{EXT. PLAIN OF HOTH - DAY}
<ACTION>__{A small figure gallops across the windswept ice slope.  The bundled rider is mounted on a large gray snow lizard, a Tauntaun.  Curving plumes of snow rise from beneath the speeding paws of the two-legged beast. The rider gallops up a slope and reins his lizard to a stop.  Pulling off his protective goggles, Luke Skywalker notices something in the sky.  He takes a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt and through them sees smoke rising from where the probe robot has crashed. The wind whips at Luke's fur-lined cap and he activates a comlink transmitter.  His Tauntaun shifts and moans nervously beneath him.}

Luke hangs upside down, ankles frozen into icy stalactites, his extended arms within a foot of the snow floor.  One side of his face is covered in a dried mask of frozen blood.  He opens his eyes as a chilling moan of the hideous ice creature echoes off the gorge walls.  Luke pulls himself up, grabs hold of his ankles, and futilely tries to unfasten the throngs. Exhausted, he drops back into his hanging position.  As he hangs there, he spies his lightsaber lying near a pile of his discarded gear, about three feet out of reach. He focuses on the saber and, as his hand strains toward the weapon, he squeezes his eyes tight in concentration. Just as the ice creature looms over Luke, the lightsaber jumps into Luke's hand. The young warrior instantly ignites his sword, swinging up, and cuts himself loose from the ice.  He flops to the snow in a heap.  The startled creature moves back, his giant yellow eyes blinking.  Luke scrambles to his feet.  He swings his lightsaber and the beast screams in pain.}

A large asteroid tumbles away from the Falcon's path at top speed. Several smaller asteroids crash into the big one, creating small explosions on its surface.  Other asteroids of all sizes pass by in every direction, some colliding and exploding.  The tiny Millennium Falcon veers around the big asteroid and races past it through the rain of rocks, followed by four TIE fighters, which bob and weave around the asteroids. One of the pursuing TIE fighters connects with an asteroid and explodes.  The other fighters are pelted with a steady stream of smaller explosions. Two huge asteroids tumble toward the Millennium Falcon, which quickly banks around both of them.  The three TIE fighters follow in hot pursuit until one of the fighters scrapes an asteroid and tumbles out of control into deep space.}

Together they stand at the large window of the medical center looking out on the Rebel Star Cruiser and a dense, luminous galaxy swirling in space. Luke puts his arm around Leia.  The droids stand next to them, and Threepio moves closer to Artoo putting his arm on him.  The group watches as the Millennium Falcon moves into view, makes a turn, and zooms away into space.}
