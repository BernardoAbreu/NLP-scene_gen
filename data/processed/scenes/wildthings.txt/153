<L>__{exterior smiling jack's suzie's room day}
<A>__{gloria sits on suzie's bed, books spread out around her. ruby stands beside her.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{you asked if suzie knew about the salt creek land deal? girl read every book she could find on it, the van ryans too.}
<A>__{ruby takes a photo album from among the books, opens it, tosses a photograph on the bed. it is one we have seen before.}
<B>__{angle on photo}
<A>__{a stately old gentleman in a three piece suit. white hair, a white handlebar mustache. a derby on his knee, a walking stick at his side. he stares out at the world from a high backed wicker chair, flanked by potted palms and two small terriers. across the bottom of the picture is the name "william tecumseh van ryan." and beside that, in another hand "dear old dad."}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{wasn't enough van ryan had to destroy the people who invested here. he got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes. one trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.}
<P>__{(indicating the photo)}
<D>__{that came with her.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{and the child...}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{she had it, before she drank herself to death. wasn't exactly a love child...}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{suzie.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{then you're not her grandmother...}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{raised her like she was, but no, walter's my only child.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he was a good boy, till the army took him.}
<A>__{gloria looks once more at the old photograph.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{so suzie and sandra van ryan were half sisters.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{and the other girl, kelly. suzie's niece.}
<A>__{gloria stands, a little weary. ruby walks her from the room.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{thank you for talking to me, ruby. i am sorry about suzie, she...}
<A>__{they have gotten to the main room and gloria stops short, noticing for the first time that the beat up old black and white tv has been replaced by a high tech, giant screen television.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{i'm fine. nice tv.}
<A>__{the old lady nods, walks her outside.}
