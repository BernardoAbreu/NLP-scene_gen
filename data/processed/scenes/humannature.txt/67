<A>__{we see a tent in a clearing. a smoking campfire. there is a rustling inside the tent. lila steps out naked. she is covered with fur. she pours a cup of coffee, and stands, comfortable in her skin, watching the world around her. squirrels jump from tree to tree, birds look down at her. she smiles.}
