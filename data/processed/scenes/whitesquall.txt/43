<L>__{exterior albatross harbor night}
<A>__{the boat moves off leaving the lights of antigua behind. chuck watches as the island disappears below the horizon.}
<L>__{exterior deck day}
<A>__{the wind is up and the seas are high. the ship is under full sail driving at top speed. foam sprays from the bow as it slices through the water what she was born to do. the crew line the starboard rail, thrilled to be part of the performance. tod is at the wheel with chris nearby. the sails tower above him like a mountain of silk. he wrestles the wheel, careful to hold his course against the powerful trade winds. skipper, making his rounds inspects the heading on the compass and nods.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{it's a good sail boys.}
<A>__{tod and chris beam. compliments are rare from this man.}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{thank you, sir. shall we trim the main skipper? i think we could get another knot or two.}
<A>__{skipper turns and looks at tod, a twinkle in his eye.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{as you like.}
<A>__{gravy. the two gloat as they lighten the mainsheet tackle. phil joins them.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{what do you say i have a crack at the wheel?}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{i'd say, fuck off junior.}
<A>__{they laugh. phil slinks behind the chart house, hurt, and angry. he spots a spear gun stowed against the chart house. as tod and chris pull in the main, it strains and stretches against the powerful wind. phil aims the spear gun at the mainsail from behind the chart house and silently fires. there is a wicked pop as the spear punctures the sail, passing through it, followed by a loud shredding as the huge sail splits.}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{jesus christ!! let it out. let it out!!}
<A>__{the sound brings skipper onto the deck like a shot.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{hard to port! hard to port!!}
<A>__{calamity, as tod cranks the ship into the wind. the canvas goes limp as the ship hauls to a dead stop. people dive everywhere to drop sail.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{start the engine. all ahead full!! scallop the square and drop the rest!!}
<A>__{he shoots a glare at tod and chris.}
<C>__{tod}
<P>__{(bewildered)}
<D>__{i don't know what happened skipper. it just blew out.}
<A>__{skipper turns to the task at hand without a word. what had been praise is now reduced to embarrassment and confusion. phil, still hidden behind the chart house returns the spear gun and smiles to himself at tod's arrogance turned humility.}
