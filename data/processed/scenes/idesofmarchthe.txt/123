<L>__{interior press room cincinnati next morning}
<A>__{we're at a press conference the governor, paul, ben, and the rest of the staff, are standing behind the microphone. the governor is making a statement}
<C>__{gov. morris}
<D>__{the entire staff is in a state of shock. we have sent our condolences to jack and joanna stearns and their whole family...}
<C>__{gov. morris }
<D>__{and of course our hearts go out to them... it's hard to imagine what they're going through... all we know at this point is it appears to be a drug...an accidental prescription overdose. ida?}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{is suicide ruled out?}
<C>__{gov. morris}
<D>__{we have no reason to believe...}
<A>__{he looks to paul.}
<C>__{gov. morris }
<D>__{i don't think we have any of that information yet. obviously there will be a full investigation. just wanted to say that our hearts go out...our prayers go out to the entire family...and she was part of our family.}
<C>__{reporter 5}
<D>__{did you know her well governor?}
<C>__{gov. morris}
<D>__{not well. but i did know her, and what i saw was a hard working, young woman, with a great and positive spirit. it's a very sad day in our campaign and a very sad day for the people close to jack.}
<C>__{reporter 6}
<D>__{how long has she interned with you governor?}
<A>__{the governor looks back at paul. paul steps up to the mic.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{she'd only been on the road with us for a few weeks...maybe four i think, i can check.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{will you continue with your schedule today? you're set to tour proctor & gamble this afternoon.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{we will most certainly stay on schedule. this accident, and we have to assume for now it's an accident, is just simply a tragedy. the work, the schedule won't be altered. it just means that those of us that knew molly will go about our jobs with a heavy heart.}
<A>__{as these questions continue, the governor's cell phone vibrates. he pulls it from his pocket and reads the name of the caller. it reads "molly." he looks up. panic starts to set in the only sounds we hear are his heart beating and the phone vibrating. the governor looks at each of his staff members. then he scans around the room looking through the press corps up to the back doorway where he locks eyes with stephen. stephen holds a cell phone to his ear. they stare at each other. then stephen hangs up, and the governor's phone stops vibrating. stephen turns and leaves.}
