<L>__{interior bathroom hallway bedroom day}
<A>__{georges is shaving. suddenly we hear, coming from the bedroom,}
<C>__{anne's voice}
<P>__{(loud)}
<D>__{help... help... help... help... help...}
<A>__{georges wipes his face and, to the sound of anne's cries, crosses the hallway and enters the bedroom. anne continues to cry out in a monotone to herself. georges goes over to her bed.}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(trying to calm her like a sick child)}
<D>__{what is it?..}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{are you in pain?... what's the matter?... is your pad full?}
<A>__{he raises her blanket for an instant and sniffs, then replaces it.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{no... so what's hurting you?}
<A>__{he sits down beside her on the bed. takes her hand.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{it's all right... it's all right ... i'm here... everything's fine... we'll... hold on, i will tell you a story... but you must be quiet, i can't talk too loud, it wears me out... here we go: when i was little... well, i wasn't as little as all that... it was toward the end of primary school, so i was about ten, dad and mom sent me to a holiday camp. they thought it would do me good to spend the summer with kids my own age... we were lodged in an old castle in the midst of a magnificent wooded landscape... i think it was in the auvergne... i don't know... in any case it was the opposite of what i'd expected... we had to get up at 6 and go for a morning swim. not far from the castle, there was a pond fed by an icy mountain stream. we entered it running, in a double file. you know, i was never very sporty. they had a program to keep us on the go all day, probably to nip any potential pubescent impulses in the bud ... but the worst thing was the food. the third day after our arrival, there was rice pudding for lunch. i hate rice pudding. we sat at long tables in a huge hall. i didn't want to eat the stuff and the housemaster said to me: you won't get up until you've cleared your plate. so after the meal everybody left the room, and i remained seated, in tears. i had made a secret pact with mom. i was to send her a postcard every week.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{if i was pleased with the place i was to draw some flowers on it, or if not, some stars. she kept the card; it was covered all over in stars. after three hours, i was allowed to leave the table. i went up to my room, got into bed and had a fever of 42 degrees. it was diphtheria. they took me to the nearest hospital where i was put in an isolation ward, which meant that mom, when she came to visit me, could only wave at me through a window. at some point i lost that postcard. it's a pity.}
<A>__{anne has become ever calmer during georges' story. he still holds her hand.}
<B>__{long silence.}
<A>__{then georges reaches across anne's body to get hold of his pillow and presses it over her face. stifled sounds from anne. everything that can still move in her body starts to move. georges presses down heavily on the pillow, lies on it with his whole weight, for a long time, until all anne's movements stop. then he sits up, exhausted, and without removing the pillow from her face, remains seated beside her.}
<B>__{silence.}
