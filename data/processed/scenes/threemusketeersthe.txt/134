<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior seaside cliffs night}
<A>__{a hundred feet below, waves crash on a rocky shore. on the jagged cliff above, a black mass of trees is outlined against a stormy sky filled with copper colored clouds, surreal in effect. a sinister procession approaches the cliff. porthos leads milady. she wears a simple white shift, her hair pulled back into a long braid. she looks years younger, the girl she used to be. the executioner walks behind them. followed by armand de winter, aramis, d'artagnan. and athos. he watches every step. the procession stops at the cliff's edge. thunder rumbles. lightning slashes the sky. the executioner ties milady's hands behind her. the executioner removes a bright scimitar from beneath his cloak. milady catches athos' eye. he holds her gaze. he stares at milady unflinchingly, as if to burn her image into his eyes, so that he might keep it there until the day he dies. aramis reaches inside his cloak, removes the sacred priestly cloth he carries. the executioner delivers the formal litany:}
<C>__{executioner}
<D>__{i forgive you for your crimes. die in peace.}
<A>__{athos repeats, whispers:}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{die in peace.}
<A>__{aramis comes forward, intones:}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{i am the resurrection and the life, sayeth the lord. he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live; and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die...}
<A>__{the executioner's sharp blade shines in the light of dawn.}
<C>__{executioner}
<D>__{on your knees.}
<A>__{milady kneels, the executioner steps closer. the tableau silhouetted against a reddish glow on the horizon. the executioner brushes milady's braid from her neck, exposing the soft white skin beneath. he raises the scimitar overhead, and just as he is about to bring it down... a cry is heard, torn from the heart:}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{athos grabs the executioner's wrist, and twists the scimitar loose. it falls to the ground.}
<C>__{executioner}
<D>__{what's this...?}
<A>__{porthos leaps forward, locks his great arms around athos.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{athos }
<A>__{but athos breaks free. milady rises to her feet. athos rushes to her.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{forgive me, sabine. please forgive.}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{i do.}
<A>__{the words he could never say, finally spoken. milady locks eyes with him. athos' desperate act, the pure feeling it signifies, has given her a kind of release. and the strength to face her fate.}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{the cardinal intends to assassinate the king at his birthday celebration on friday.}
<A>__{and with that, milady reaches forward, offers a gentle kiss. then, as athos and the others look on, stunned, uncertain... she takes a backward step, finds the cliff's edge... and steps over it. the executioner rushes to look after. the others follow. except for athos, who remains rooted in place, eyes on the distant horizon. a long silence. thunder rumbles.}
<C>__{executioner}
<D>__{god's justice be done.}
<A>__{d'artagnan sadly lowers his head. porthos puts a consoling hand on his shoulder. aramis stands to the other side, mutters:}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{amen.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{musketeers.}
<A>__{d'artagnan, porthos, and aramis turn. athos has regained his former self. stoic, in command. and hiding a broken heart.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{the king's life in danger. we have work to do.}
