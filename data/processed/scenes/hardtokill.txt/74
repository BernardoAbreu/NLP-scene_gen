<A>__{we see a little more of where we are: a pretty little retreat, nestled amid rolling hills. with the evening light, the mood seems softer.}

<A>__{storm on a different couch very tired. looking terrible. andy sits on the floor at the coffee table a phone beside her, the table covered with notepads, scribbled pages.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{we'll find your friend o'malley. we'll just keep phoning ...}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{listen. i'm getting out of here.}
<A>__{he grabs for a cane resting against the sofa.}
<C>__{andy}
<P>__{(knows he has no chance)}
<D>__{i will buy tickets to that.}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{i just need some food and a few days to get my strength.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{days? try a few weeks.}
<A>__{storm braces against the cane, ready to try to stand. andy gets up, to catch him. this infuriates storm's pride.}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{you helped me, okay? i'm grateful. but every day you keep helping puts you in more danger.}
<C>__{andy}
<P>__{(deadpan)}
<D>__{danger is my middle name.}
<A>__{this is no joke to storm.}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{i've been dead, andy. you wouldn't like it.}
<A>__{he tries to get up. andy stops him.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{hey, hey i don't think you get the picture here. your muscles have been getting electronic stimulation at the hospital, but it's not like actually being up and bearing weight.}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{you're the one who doesn't get the picture.}
<C>__{storm }
<D>__{first of all, i ain't no fucking invalid! and second, i don't have time }
<A>__{he makes it upright, shaking, with a "see, i told you" look. he starts toward the kitchen. andy looks very worried but doesn't try to stop him. first step okay. second okay. third blam! the cane slips and he falls flat on his face. too weak to break the fall. low angle storm we see his face on the carpet and a mean desperate conviction in these eyes not to fail and not to give up. he struggles to rise it is pitiful. he's on his knees growling with effort. cane propped up, he manages to somehow stand again. one step ... two steps ... three, four ... he's absolutely exhausted. boom! falls flat again.}
