<L>__{exterior batting cage day}
<A>__{brown is watching batting practice. hayes steps into the cage and begins a preparatory ritual worthy of babe ruth rubbing dirt on his hands, stretching, knocking dirt off his spikes, twirling the bat, etc. a real slugger's routine.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{c'mon, hayes, this isn't the all star game. get up to the damn plate.}
<A>__{hayes gets in and takes his stance. on the first pitch, he takes a mighty cut and hits a pop fly to the pitcher's mound. we take quick cuts of the next three pitches. hayes takes prodigious swings at all of them, producing three more pop ups, none out of the infield. brown calls a halt.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{well, you may run like mays, but you hit like shit.}
<C>__{hayes}
<D>__{my stroke'll come back once i get warmed up.}
<C>__{temple}
<P>__{(referring to some stats)}
<D>__{never did get warmed up last year. hit .211 at maine. i looked him up.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{i think mr. hayes shows some promise. his speed could be a big asset.}
<C>__{pepper}
<P>__{(aside)}
<D>__{for what? running back to the dugout?}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{you gotta stop swingin' for the fences though, hayes. all you're gonna do is give yourself a hernia. with your speed you should be hittin' the ball on the ground, leggin' 'em out. every time i see you hit one in the air, you owe me twenty pushups.}
<C>__{hayes}
<D>__{hey, no problem.}
<A>__{the next pitch comes in. hayes swings and pops it up.}
<C>__{hayes}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{as he gets down to do his twenty, brown turns to temple.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{sometimes you can teach a guy to hit. you can't teach him to run.}
<B>__{brown and pepper}
<A>__{coming over to where vaughn is tossing some casual warm up pitches to jake.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{all right, vaughn, they tell us you're a pitcher. let's see what you got.}
<A>__{brown and pepper stand behind taylor for a better view. vaughn goes into his wind up and fires a screaming fast ball that taylor has no chance to get out of his crouch to catch. the ball rockets an inch over brown's head, and slams into the backstop. brown stands frozen a second, contemplating his brush with eternity, then turns to pepper.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{nice velocity.}
<C>__{pepper}
<D>__{sounded like it.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{sorry, lou, i wasn't quite expectin' that much octane.}
<A>__{brown turns to the clubhouse man who's holding a speed gun.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{how much?}
<C>__{clubhouse man}
<D>__{96 miles an hour.}
<C>__{brown}
<P>__{(to pepper)}
<D>__{better teach him some control before he kills somebody.}
<B>__{rodger dorn}
<A>__{fielding grounders at third base. he plays them off to his left side a bit, almost as if he's afraid to get bit by them.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{c'mon, dorn, get in front of the damn ball.}
<P>__{(making like a bullfighter)}
<D>__{don't give me this ole' bullshit.}
<C>__{dorn}
<D>__{i took one of these in the eye last year. nearly lost my sight.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{i'm deeply moved. every time you play it off your hip, you give me forty sit ups.}
<C>__{dorn}
<D>__{what! that's little league shit.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{so is this.}
<A>__{brown strikes an effeminate fielding position, like betty grable shying from a mouse. dorn burns.}
<B>__{pedro cerrano}
<A>__{in the batting cage, knocking the cover off pitch after pitch with his black bat.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{jesus, this guy hits a ton. how come nobody else picked up on him?}
<C>__{temple}
<P>__{(to the batting practice pitcher)}
<D>__{okay, harris, that's enough fast balls. throw some curves.}
<A>__{harris winds and throws a fair to middlin' curve ball. cerrano swings and misses it a foot.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{dorn approaches brown at the cage.}
<C>__{dorn}
<D>__{lou, i wanna have a word with you here.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{dorn}
<P>__{(whipping out his contract)}
<D>__{those penalty sit ups you want me to do? i got it right here in my contract that i don't have to do any calisthenics i don't feel are necessary. what do ya think of that?}
<A>__{everyone around the batting cage has stopped what they're doing to see how brown will react. brown looks at the contract a second, then drops it on the ground, unzips his fly, and gives it a golden shower. on dorn's stunned face, we...}
