<L>__{exterior times square night (n.y.) (crane shot)}
<A>__{as our heroes arise into the neon filled big city wonderland, relieved to be alive, gazing around at the awesome spectacle known as times square. a huge digital clock tells us it's a quarter to midnight. sean wraps his arm around her.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{it's over, rennie. it's finally over.}
<A>__{camera rises above them, racking back to the subway exit. guess who has just made an encore...with more energy than ever!!!}
<B>__{sean and rennie}
<A>__{look all around them, having never been to a city as big as this. they finally turn far enough around to spot jason in a series of three quick cuts, each one closer than the last.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{god...please no...}
<A>__{but jason keeps on coming.}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{somebody help us!! he's going to kill us!!!}
<A>__{but the heavy times square foot traffic ignores her, bustling onward. rennie and sean have no choice but to flee again.}
<B>__{jason}
<A>__{shoves his way through the preoccupied pedestrians; they've certainly seen weirder characters than him here. he moves past a group of street urchins listening to some rap from their ghetto blaster. his foot obliterates their stereo system with one stride. they instantly pull out switchblades and chains.}
<C>__{street urchin}
<D>__{you're dead meat, slime bag.}
<A>__{jason stops, turning around, towering over the kids. he has blood and gore caked everywhere, his skin charred from the electrocution. jason starts to remove his mask, facing them squarely.}
<B>__{tight on street urchins}
<A>__{as jason's mask comes off out of frame. their tough faces turn to putty, scared completely shitless.}
<C>__{street urchin}
<D>__{hey man, it's cool, it's cool...}
<A>__{they turn tail and race like the wind. jason steps forward so that we're looking at the back of his head, never seeing his naked face. he slips his hockey mask on again, turns into a close up, then exits.}
