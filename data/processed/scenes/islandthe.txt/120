<L>__{exterior. alley day}
<A>__{the refuge of shadow. the alley is divided by a lodeway and the walls on each side are jutted with dumpsters. lincoln and ester run up the narrowed strip of sidewalk, forced into single file. a huge shape looms ahead. a garbage vehicle known as a "scow". like a leviathan spreading its tentacles, the scow's tube arrays dock with the dumpsters and start sucking the contents out. lincoln glances back to find ester has stopped and is cringing away from the tentacled monster. he returns to her, his eyes flicking around, aware that their real predators are close }
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{we have to keep going.}
<A>__{he takes ester's hand, drawing her onward. but ester recoils, shaking off his grip. now he looks at her more closely. she's panting, shuddering, fraught with trauma. her voice is haunted }
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{p l e a s e . . . please, i want to go back...}
<A>__{she shrinks into the shadows, shaking her head. the hatchling wanting to return to the nest. lincoln meets her eye, deeply }
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{t h o s e men that's what they want too.}
<A>__{ester holds his gaze, chest heaving. then looks back towards the alley mouth. her fingers reach for her belly, clawing a little. then her eyes lower, assimilating, reason reasserting its heavy grip. lincoln senses her turmoil. his voice is soft but sturdy }
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{we have to keep going, ester.}
<A>__{ester looks up at him again. the forlorn air seems to have faded. her eyes, grimly set. her face, a little haggard. older somehow. she takes lincoln's hand and together they head off up the alley.}
