<C>__{ashby}
<P>__{(getting it)}

<C>__{blonde}
<D>__{oh, i didn't know you... here. sorry.}

<C>__{ashby}
<D>__{tough day?}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{brutal day. they say the streets are lined with money down here, but i guess you have to know the secret handshake. what are you drinking?}
<C>__{ashby}
<D>__{uh, maker's mark. rocks.}

<C>__{ashby}
<D>__{so, what do you do?}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{it's more like what aren't i doing. my partners and i are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. we tried the venture capitalist route in the valley, but then again who hasn't up there.}
<C>__{ashby}
<D>__{silicon valley?}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{that's right. so, brainiacs that we are, we thought we'd be innovative and relocate east. try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here.}
<A>__{the drinks arrive. lily hands the bartender a twenty.}
<C>__{ashby}
<D>__{i can }
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{on me. for the seat. cheers.}
<A>__{she flashes a trademark smile as they clink glasses.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{so we've been meeting with banks all day. it's amazing how many ways they can say "no" without ever using the word.}
<C>__{ashby}
<D>__{well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery.}
<A>__{lily arches an eyebrow at ashby.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.}
<C>__{ashby}
<D>__{no, no. nothing like that. i work in a bank.}
<C>__{lily}
<P>__{(leaning in)}
<D>__{really? wish we had met eight hours ago.}
<A>__{ashby nods and shyly looks away. he could be blushing. lily lets the moment play out for a beat before looking over her shoulder.}
<C>__{lily}
<P>__{(getting up)}
<D>__{my partners are here.}
<A>__{ashby reverts back to schlub mode.}
<C>__{ashby}
<D>__{oh. well, thanks for the drink.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{you're welcome. i was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us. ashby brightens again.}
