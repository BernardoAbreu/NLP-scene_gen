<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior recovery chamber}
<A>__{the chamber is half constructed out of plexiglas at the end of the hallway of habitats. on the recovery bed, a sheet drapes over sebastian's invisible body. the gentle bleatings of medical machinery pound out a dulling rhythm. linda sleeps in a corner chair as matt slips into the room. he checks the readouts on sebastian then takes a seat by linda. she wakes with a start.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{s'okay. you nodded off.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{his breathing's hypnotic. how long's it been?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{seventeen hours.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{where are the others?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{in the lab crunching numbers. we've got enough data there for two lifetimes of research.}
<A>__{linda rubs her temples and gestures to the bed.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{i keep looking at that hole, wondering if he's really there.}
<A>__{she notices something out of the corner of his eye. the sheet twitches.}
<C>__{linda }
<D>__{did you see...}
<A>__{the sheet twitches again.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{he may be coming out of it.}
<A>__{linda and matt watch intently. then suddenly... the sheets thrash violently. a yell of pain.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{the lights! turn off the goddamn lights! ah christ!}
<A>__{linda jumps up and crosses to sebastian. matt rushes to the wall and turns off the lights. darkness. the room is lit by the glow of machinery.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice }
<D>__{i can't... i can't close my eyes. i can't close my eyes.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{your eyelids are transparent.}
<A>__{the sheets slowly stop thrashing.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{so i ... i'm...}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{my arms. i can.. where? ... i can feel them...}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{your arms ... your whole body... it worked, sebastian. it worked.}
<A>__{the sheet rises and slips away. the wires, seemingly connected to thin air, spread out like a spider's web and then fall away one by one. the monitors all go dead.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{mirror. i ... i want to see.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{over here in the corner.}
<A>__{matt motions to a dark corner of the room, toward a mirror and sink. we push in on the mirror. no reflection. suddenly it fogs up ... sebastian's breath. a finger tracing appears in the fog ... but of course we see no finger. the sink faucet twists on and water runs. it cups into the shape of hands and lifts into the air, splashing against the surface of sebastian's face. beads of water cling to his f ace, outlining it i shape f or a moment before dripping away.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{what was it like?}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{i ... it's hard to think.}
<A>__{sebastian's voice is now behind him. matt turns around.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice }
<D>__{the transformation... i remember every molecule in my body shattering.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{it was painful?}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{at first... but then everything went black. i couldn't see or hear or feel anything. it was all just black... like i wasn't connected.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{your system received quite a shock.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{at least my senses are starting to return... you're wearing your shalimar, aren't you?}
<A>__{linda realizes that he's standing very close by. her hair lifts slightly and sebastian inhales. chills go down her spine.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{sebastian.}
<A>__{linda's hair drops back to her shoulders.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{this is weird. i'm looking through myself at the floor. i'm looking right through myself. i can't tell ...}
<A>__{he bumps into a chair.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice }
<D>__{... where my body is.}
<A>__{a moment of silence.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{sebastian?}
<A>__{no answer. linda and matt look at each other, slightly alarmed.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{sebastian?}
<A>__{an indentation forms on the bed a moment later.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{you really can't see me. can you?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{gimme symptoms. dizziness, nausea, headache, body ache, disorientation.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{no, just tired.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's funny. i can see everything... more than before... but i can't see myself.}
