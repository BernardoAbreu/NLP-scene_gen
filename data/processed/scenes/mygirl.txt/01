<B>__{to get down}
<A>__{vada jumps down, and we can now see that the tree was on the sultenfuss' front lawn inside view of front door, vada enters and closes it as soon as vada has entered, she waits for someone to come running and ask her if she's all right, where she's been, they were so worried etc., nothing happens, all she can hear is the noise that the tv is making. so she opens the door again and slams it. still nothing. she decides to give up, and go find harry, she walks to the living room where the tv is on, harry and grammoo are asleep in their chairs vada begins to ascend the stairs, depressed}

<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{stop hiding harry, you run harry. when i first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when i saw a family lived here, i thought, "if i'm living without a family, at least i can work with one, and maybe once in a while i will be invited in for supper."}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.}
