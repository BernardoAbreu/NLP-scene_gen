<A>__{of marty's face. he is staring into the camera, at whoever took the picture. his head is thrown back slightly; he is laughing. from offscreen in the quiet room we hear a static hum and then abby's voice over an intercom.}
<C>__{abby's voice}
<D>__{ray...?}
<B>__{back to ray}
<A>__{he turns from the photograph and walks to an intercom speaker next to the mounted moose's head. he presses the speaker button.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{yeah...}
<A>__{he idly takes his unlit cigarette and sticks it in the moose's mouth.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{...you get what you wanted?}
<C>__{abby's voice}
<D>__{yeah. let's get out of here.}
<A>__{marty's front foyer we are looking across a dark, high ceilinged foyer toward the front door. ray leans against the doorjamb, in silhouette in the open doorway. he is facing a curved staircase that descends into the foyer. abby appears at the second floor landing and starts down the stairs.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{why d'you wanna leave all this?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{you kidding? i don't wanna leave all this, i just wanna leave marty...}
<A>__{as she reaches the bottom of the stairs:}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{...drive me to a motel?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you can stay at my place, i will drop you there.}
<C>__{abby}

<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i just gotta see a guy.}
<A>__{marty's bar the crowd has thinned out. meurice and debra are in the foreground. ray enters from the street and makes his way over to them.}

<A>__{he pours debra another drink and starts to set one up for ray.}
<C>__{meurice}
<D>__{...ray, this is debra. she's a geologist. that's the theory of rocks.}
<A>__{ray nods at debra.}
<C>__{ray}
