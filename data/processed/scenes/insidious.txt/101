<L>__{interior dalton's bedroom, new house night}
<A>__{the door opens. all is mute as josh enters, skulking carefully through the darkness. the curtains lull in the slightest of breezes. josh stands over dalton. he stares down at his sons body, then lets his gaze drift around the room...past the closet, past the drawings pinned to the wall and the toybox...all the way to the corner of the ceiling that elise was so frightened of. josh's eyes drill into the shadows. is there something waiting there? finally, josh sits down beside dalton. he grips his sons hand.}

<D>__{where are you? where did you go?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{can you hear me? i'm begging you to show me that you can hear me...i don't know how to help you. please tell me what to do.}
<A>__{josh's torment fills the air...but dalton doesn't move.}
<C>__{josh }
<D>__{please god, please help me...give me my son back. i will do anything just to have him back.}
<A>__{josh studies dalton's face for a response. nothing. not a twitch. he collapses forward onto dalton. holding him tight.}
<C>__{josh }
<D>__{i need him back. i need him to show me that he can hear me. please...}
<A>__{for a moment, all we can hear is josh's breathing. then...something happens. something josh doesn't see. dalton's face twitches. it is a very slight movement. this movement is followed by something that is hard to miss one of the tacks pinning one of dalton's drawings to the wall begins to wind loose. it pops free, shooting across the room like a kernel of popcorn...followed by another tack. the second tack lands in josh's lap. puzzled, he picks it up, examining it. he looks up, his eye drawn to the picture on the wall. with total astonishment, he sees the two remaining tacks works themselves free, popping out of the wall. the drawing floats down to the ground. josh stoops down, picking it up. it is a drawing split into two halves. the left half is a self portrait of dalton, lying in bed, looking down from above. the right half is a depiction of outer space squiggly stars and bloated planets. dalton has drawn another version of himself on this side, flying above the house with another man. at the bottom of the first drawing, dalton has written `last night i watched myself sleep'. a tear falls down josh's face. he begins to cry. deep and painful tears he has long pent up. beneath the second drawing, dalton has written `then i flew away.'}
