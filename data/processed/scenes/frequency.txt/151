<C>__{frank}
<D>__{hang on.}
<A>__{frank fishes around the desk drawer for some electrical tape...quickly ripping off strips of tape...covering the wallet. then he goes to the window. crouches on the floor, digging his nails around edges of the loose floorboard.}
<B>__{back to john}
<A>__{getting up.}
<D>__{frank (o.s.) (cont'd)}
<P>__{(over the ham)}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{john scrambles to window. crouches down on floor, reaching to find: frank's wallet covered in electrical tape! john goes back to the radio.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{we're in business. just sit tight...and don't worry.}
<A>__{and john is up, grabs gun & shield. sprints for the door.}
