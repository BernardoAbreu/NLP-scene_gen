<A>__{elvis pushes through the door and into a hall, dead eye stare focused up ahead where the hallway turns sharply. he catches a glimpse of lex. smiling like the devil, elvis bolts.}
<L>__{interior other hallway day}
<A>__{lex catches up with hawk and trip just as elvis swings around the corner and marauds after them cackling maniacally. a mad chase ensues. down hallways. around corners. upstairs. down ramps. hawk, trip, and lex scramble as fast as they can to escape the clutches of their sideburn clad nemesis. as the boys pass a classroom, a nerd comes out pushing a projector on an av cart. thinking fast, hawk grabs it out of the nerd's hands and pushes it down the hall at elvis.}

<D>__{hey, i'm responsible for that!}
<A>__{crash! elvis bashes face first into the rolling cart. he and the projector go tumbling. not wasting a second, elvis is back on his feet and after them again. the nerd grabs his hair in horror at the sight of the smashed projector.}
<B>__{around a corner}
<A>__{elvis skids around the corner and trips on a fire hose stretched across the floor from its glass box to a water fountain pipe. he slides on his belly along the polished floor unable to stop.}
