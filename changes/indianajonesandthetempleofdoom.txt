<LOC>__{1.     INT.  "THE DRAGON" NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{A Chinese GONG SOUNDS and the glittering doors of an art Deco pa- poda slide open to reveal a mammoth silver stairway down which rows of beautiful women start descending   (BEGIN MAIN TITLES) The lovely ladies are a mix of races and they sing a strange, haunting melody -- one might think them a heavenly choir, if it weren't for their sexy, clinging lame gowns.}
<LOC>__{2.     INT.  CLUB ENTRANCE}
<ACTION>__{From the ethereal beauties, we cut to a street urchin's dirty face: SHORT ROUND is a ten-year-old Chinese kis wearing a beat- up American baseball cap. Sneaking into the club, Short Round weaves past the fancy gowns and silk suits, heading toward the music in the main ballroom.}
<LOC>__{3.     INT.  THE BALLROOM}
<ACTION>__{Short Round enters and stares across the smoky nightclub.  On the stage, he sees a giant paper-mache dragon laying curled around the pagoda. Now, the dragon's eyes light up, its nostrils exhale smoke and its enormous jaws open.  Out of the dragon's mouth walks the star of the stage show: WILLIE SCOTT, a dreamy beauty singing a sultry solo white the or- chestra wails the accompaniment. But Short Round's not here to ogle crooning dames.  He surveys the rich Chinese, American and European revelers.  Jewels flash and champagne flows.  Short Round finally spots a table of somber-looking Chinese men in suits. Short Round chews gum and stares at the men.  Then he turns to go.  WU HAN, a waiter with a scar across his cheek, watches Short Round leave.}
<LOC>__{4.     INT.  CLUB ENTRANCE}
<ACTION>__{As Short Round hurries toward the exit, he bumps into a man in a tuxedo entering the club.  Short Round looks up at the man, but we don't see his face. Then Short Round is grabbed by the scruff of his neck and a door- man hustles him out the door, Short Round yelling insults all the way. A maitre d' apologizes to the man in the tuxedo and two hat-check girls smile at him familiarly as he continues into the ballroom. We notice something incongruous:  the man in the tuxedo is wear- ing work boots caked with mud.}
<LOC>__{5.     INT.  THE BALLROOM}
<ACTION>__{The man in the tuxedo stops to watch Willie Scott singing sexily on the stage.  Then he looks around and sees the table of somber Chinese men that Short Round spotted earlier. As the man in the tuxedo walks toward the table, he removes a cigarette from a silver case.  He arrives at the table just as the chorus and orchestra reach a crescendo -- And on the stage, a glistening, muscular slave swings a huge ham- mer toward an enormous brass gong -- The man in the tuxedo leans to receive a light from a cigarette- girl and, as the GONG BOOMS, the match flares to reveal his face for the first time: It's INDIANA JONES.  Elegant in a tuxedo -- dressed to kill.  The TITLES END and over this a legend appears on the screen:}

<ACTION>__{Lao just laughs evilly -- until a waiter moves up behind Lao and the crimelord suddenly stiffens.  He lets go of Willie's wrist and raises his hands off the table.  Chen stops collecting the money and jewels. Kao Kan tenses and Indy smiles at Wu Han, the Chinese waiter with the scar, who is standing behind Lao.  Wu Han has a towel over his hand  --  under it, he has a pistol pressed against Lao's spine.}

<DIAL>__{So, the game's not over. Put the antidote on the table, Lao.}
<ACTION>__{Lao carefully reaches into his pocket and puts a small glass vial of liquid next to the cash, gold, jewels, poison and sacred box. Indy looks relieved as he reaches for the vial of antidote -- then he hears a muffled report!  And another! Wu Han groans and sways.  Indy starts to stand but Chen immedi- ately turns the smoking pistol with the silencer that he used to kill Wu Han -- Indy sees it pointed at him now and he remains in his seat. Kao Kan stands and grabs Wu Han, easing the phoney waiter into the chair he just vacated.  The muffled shooting hasn't attracted any attention.  The nightclub activity continues an Indy speaks emotionally to his dying friend.}
<CHAR>__{INDIANA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Wu Han  --  listen to me  --  I'm going to get you out of here.}

<DIAL>__{Don't be sad, Dr. Jones -- you will soon join him.}
<ACTION>__{Indy's gaze shifts from his dead friend to Lao's sneering face. Then Indy sees the murderous Chen giggling perversely.  Indy's anger is compounded by the poison burning in his gut and his vis- ion of Chen's ugly face blurs into a double image -- Indy stands up unsteadily.  Chen assumes he's about to keel over from the poison -- but Indy suddenly turns and grabs a real wai- ter at another table.  The waiter holds a long skewer of roasted pigeons that he's just set afire -- Indy grabs the skewer of pigeons flambee and hurls is across the table!  Chen fires and misses -- and screams as the skewer stabs into his chest and the burning pigeons flame in front of his hor- rified face! This the other tables definitely notice.  There are screams and all hell breaks loose.  Indiana shoves past Willie and reaches for the vial on the table --}
<CHAR>__{INDIANA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The antidote -- !}
<ACTION>__{But he's grabbed from behind by Kao Kan.  Indy elbows the punk, reaches back and grabs his head -- and somersaults Kao Kan onto the table! As nubmer two son crashes into the table, the impact sends the Emperor Nurhachi's ashes billowing into Lao's stricken face! Indiana yells as he sees the vial of antidote rolling across the table -- and falling! Indiana dives and catches the antidote just before it hits the floor -- then Indy's hand is brutally stomped on by one of Lao's henchmen and the vial rolls away. Indiana angrily raises his head, smashing it up into the hench- man's groin -- the man howls like a banshee and hobbles away. Meanwhile, Willie watches Lao grabbing for cash from the table. Willie lunges past the pigeon-skewered Chen to snatch the jewels, but unfortunately Kao Kan knocks them off the table as he leaps to attack Indy. Indiana scrambles on his hands and knees after the rolling vial. People keep kicking it -- he almost has it when Willie runs into him, trips and lands on her back.}

<ACTION>__{Gunfire explodes and they both scramble in different directions. Indy dives through the fleeing nightclub patrons and slides be- hind a water-spewing fountain.  Water kicks up as Indy is shot at by Lao and his henchmen. Indy sees the vial of antidote kicked again and it spins across the marble floor -- feeling the poison, Indy shakes his head groddily and splashes water on his face. Meanwhile, Willie is chasing her diamond, shoving through the panicked crowd.  She spots the diamond!  Another elegantly dresses soman is bending to pick it up --}
<CHAR>__{WILLIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(acidly polite)}
<DIAL>__{Excuse me, but I believe that's my diamond!}
<ACTION>__{Willie smiles and suddenly kicks the woman in the butt!  Willie reaches to get the diamond but not before the other woman tackles her. Behind the fountain, Indiana makes a break -- he runs and dives on top of a serving cart.  The wheeled cart hurtles toward an un- suspecting gunman, crashes into him from behind and sends him flying head first into a row of ice buckets. Nearby, Willie slugs the other lady in the jaw and grabs for the elusive diamond just as the ice buckets showers ice across the floor -- which camouflages the diamond!}

<ACTION>__{Hiding behind the palm tree, Indiana looks around and spots a gi- ant statue at the side of the stage.  Indy makes a break for it. As the gunmen open fire, Indy springs onto a chair -- jumps onto a table -- and leaps onto the stage.  He grabs the golden broad- sword from the Chinese warrior statue! As bullets smash into the statue, Indiana hides behind it.  Then he jumps out and swings the large sword toward the enormous brass gong. The crimson cord holding the gong is SLASHED!  Indy slings the sword at his assailants and gives the three-meter-high gong a helpful shove -- The giant gong rolls and echoes as it crashes down the marble steps.  Indiana ducks behind it as it gains momentum and rolls across the dance floor. Using the gong as an enormous shield, Indy evades the gunfire ex- ploding -- bullets ricochet off the rolling brass gong as Indy runs behind it. Ahead, Willie hurries toward an exit -- she hears something and turns -- her eyes go wide as she sees the mammoth gong bearing down on her! Willie yells as Indiana grabs her arm and pulls her behind the gong with him -- Lao watches amazed as he and his gunmen dodge tables trying to get better firing positions -- and more henchmen come into the club now and start firing machine guns! As bullets clang against the gong, Indiana and Willie run behind it.  Willie hollers as they head directly for a towering, floor- to-ceiling window! Indiana grabs Willie around the waist and, after the huge gong crashes through the stained-glass window, they both fly after it!}

The gong rolls down the roof and they hit the tiles behind it, Indiana holding onto Willie as they roll one-over-the-other toward the edge -- Willie screams as they fall into thin air! Their entwined bodies plummet three stories:  ripping through a third-floor awning, crashing through an old man's mattress on a second-floor balcony -- Finally they smash through the convertible top of a parked Duesen- berg and fall into the back seat!}

<ACTION>__{Indy and Short Round's eyes meet -- and the kid realizes that his hero isn't kidding.  Willie looks at Shout Round anxiously -- she notices that Shorty is surreptitiously wrapping his foot around a rope support. Petrified, Willie also secretly wraps her foot around a rope and does likewise with her arm --}

<DIAL>__{Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!}
<ACTION>__{Indiana swings the sword with all his might -- it whooshes through the air and slashes clear through the top and bottom ropes --! Immediately Mola Ram's guards start to flee in panic -- too late! Indiana swings the sword again and the two ropes on the other side are severed -- The rope bridge is sheared in two!  It breaks in the middle and both halves fall apart!  The guards scream horribly in the air as they plunge down into the rocky gorge! Willie and Short Round cling to their established footholds and fall with the bridge toward the wall of the gorge.  Mola Ram spills forward, clutching desperately at the ropes and slats -- Below them, Indiana has latched onto a rope and swings with the bridge as it hits the gorge wall and hangs vertically now, dang- ling from its moorings at the top. There's an instant of suspended animation as all who remain alive realize they are alive.  Short Round and Willie cling near the top of the now vertical bridge. Below them, Mola Ram clutches onto one of the main ropes while directly above him the last of his guards holds on for dear life. Short Round and Willie struggle upwards, clutching ropes and stepping on slats.  Finally, Short Round heaves himself up onto solid ground and turns to help Willie up. Meanwhile, dangling below on the bridge, Indy reaches up and grabs Mola Ram's leg.  The High Priest kicks and tries to break Indy's grip.  He kicks again and smashes Indy in the face. Indy won't let go.  Suddenly the High Priest reaches up and grabs his own Thuggee guard and yanks his down by the front of his shirt -- Mola Ram shoves the luckless guard down onto Indy, trying to dislodge him by sacrificing the screaming Thuggee.  Indy manages to hang on.  The Thuggee is less fortunate and falls screaming to his death. Then Mola Ram looks across the gorge and yells.  Indy sees a dozen of the last Thuggee guards streaming out of the tunnel -- only to be stranded on the far side of the now bridgeless gorge. Indy starts climbing up after Mola Ram again.  He grabs at the back of Mola Ram's robe and pull him down.  Slipping, Mola Ram turns and it's Indy's chance to punch Mola Ram in the face. Mola Ram's eyes are glowing yellow and he's shouting incoherent- ly.  He grabs the strap of Indy's shoulder bag and stamps on In- dy's hand -- Indy falls! Indiana slips downward, scrambling to catch hols of something -- meanwhile, Mola Ram now has the bag with the Sankara Stones. Indy finally stops his downward slide and dangles dangerously near the bottom of the bridge. Across the gorge, the Thuggee guards run up a path to a small gove of trees growing on a plateau above the gorge.  The guards have bows and arrows and take firing positions -- At the top of the bridge, Mola Ram keeps climbing until rocks start poundinghim from above -- Willie and Short Round pely him with rocks which he tries to block with his arm. Indiana starts to climb again, using all his strength.  He reaches for a wooden slat -- suddenly a flaming arrow smashes into the wood! Indy turns in amazement and sees more flaming arrows rocketing across the chasm directy for him! Across the gorge, by the grove of trees, a Thuggee priest yells orders to the archers who continue to launch the flaming arrows. Indiana crawls up as the bridge starts to burn from the continu- ing bursts of fiery arrows.  At the top, Mola Ram reaches up des- perately for a hand old -- Willie smashes his hand with a rock! The High Priest yells in pain and slips down to where Indy slugs him again in the face!  They struggle as the fire burns up from beneath them. On the cliff above the fallen bridge, Willie watches the fire rising toward Indy and Mola Ram as they fight.  Short Round turns and sees something --}

<DIAL>__{Willie, look!}
<ACTION>__{They see horses galloping through a narrow pass -- the British cavalry is returning.  Captain Blumburtt and the first troops draw up their forses and dismount quickly. A fussilade of flaming arrows force the British to take cover -- they quickly start firing back at the Thuggees with rifles. As the battle above the gorge continues, Indy and Mola Ram fight below on the dangling bridge -- Indiana sees the High Priest's eyes begin glowing and he hisses insanely.  Mola Ram's hand thrusts out toward Indiana's chest and Indy yells in pain -- Indy looks down and writhes terrified as he sees Mola Ram's hand starting to enter his chest (as it entered the victim's chest during the temple sacrifice)! Mola Ram's finger are inching into Indy's body --  Indy clutches at Mola Ram's piercing hand, trying to keep the deadly fingers away from his heart. Slowly, Indy is able to push Mola Ram's hand away and his fingers withdraw from Indy's chest.  Indiana suddenly slugs the High Priest in the face and grabs for the bag of Sankara Stones --}

<ACTION>__{The blazing stones sear Mola Ram's flesh and he screams in pain. The light suddenly dies in his eyes and for one instant he looks at Indy as if awakened from a nightmare -- Mola Ram loses his balance and Indy grabs for the stones.  He manages to clutch only one of them as Mola Ram screams and falls! Indy sees the stone in his hand suddenly cool.  He watches Mola Ram plummeting downward into the chasm and finally crashing into the jagged rocks at the bottom. The irritated crocodiles are disturbed once more -- but soon wel- come the meal that just dropped in.  Jaws flash and teeth rip at the High Priest's likeless corpse. And Indy's bag with the Sankara Stones sinks into the murkly cur- rent and disappears down the river ...}

<ACTION>__{Indiana crawls up the burning bridge and Willie and Short Round reach for him at the top.  They pull him up onto the cliff and they all look around exhausted -- Across the gorge, more British troops emerge from the mine tun- nels to subdue the remaining Thuggee guards on that side. Finally the little Maharajah comes out of the dark mine tunnel. He sees Short Round across the gorge -- and bows to thank him for his help.  On the other side, Short Round waves his cap, saluting him back. Willie stands at the edge of the gorge looking down into the riv- er far below.}

<ACTION>__{The sun flares and silhouettes three figures coming over a hilltop.  Behinf them we see more smaller silhouettes appearing over the rise. Indiana, Willie and Short Round walk back down the dirt road into Mayapore -- followed by a multitude of children returning to their homeland. Willie looks at the changed landscape and seems astonished:  the barren countryside has been reborn.  They see streams flowing beneath green trees, flowers blooming and peasants harvesting golden grain in the fields.}

The children returning home start running to meet their parents who are rush- ing out to greet them. There is laughter and tears as families are reunited.  Indiana sees the old shaman approaching with the chieftain and the village elders. The shaman touches his fingers to his forehead and bows.  The three travelers return his greeting and the shaman is quite moved as he speaks to Indiana --}

But when he finally kisses her, she doesn't seem to mind at all... Short Round shakes his head, but looks sort of pleased.  When he turns away, his face lights up! Short Round runs toward the sunset, toward the three elephants being brought back to the village.  The baby elephant starts walking faster, as if he recognizes Short Round running out to meet him...}
