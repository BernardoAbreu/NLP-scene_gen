<A>__{rose caries a vacuum cleaner and bucket of cleaning supplies out to a rusted nissan sentra with a molly maid door magnet. she throws the vacuum and bucket in the back hatch, starts to close it, then stops. rose walks to the side of the car, peels off the molly maid magnet and throws that in as well. she looks at the datzman mead house with a mixture of resentment and shame. she gets into the car and cries. her cell phone rings. she digs the phone out of her bag and tries to steady her voice.}
