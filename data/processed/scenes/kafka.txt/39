<A>__{dirty yard night kafka heads for the dilapidated building or the anarchists.}
<B>__{dingy doorway}
<A>__{he goes through. a mouse scurries past him across the threshold.}
<B>__{the lopsided stairway}
<A>__{leads him up to the attic.}
<B>__{the bearded anarchist}
<A>__{watches kafka's approach. but sees nothing. his eyes are wide open, but lifeless. kafka stops at the anarchists' table. they're all lying around it on the floor except for the pockmarked anarchist who's slumped over it, her face sunk in a pool of her own blood. the youthful anarchist lies on his back, mouth open, still dribbling red. the solemn anarchist seems less than solemn due to the almost comic, convoluted, broken backed position he's in. and the neck of the bearded anarchist is all twisted. kafka just stares in disbelief then scratch! a noise from a spiral staircase close by, leading to the roof. kafka looks around in panic the attic entrance is too far to run to and there's nowhere else to hide.}
<B>__{the spiral staircase}
<A>__{a man appears from above (mr. pick). legs draped in expensive trousers, the skirt of his high buttoned coat flowing around them due to the breeze from the roof.}
<C>__{mr. pick's voice}
<D>__{ come on there's no one up there. we're going now.}
<A>__{he raises his arm up to help down whoever it is he's talking to. we hear a strange groan. followed by the appearance unclear, from the back, face hidden, or otherwise blocked by mr. pick of a strange hunched figure. he moves in a halting, cowering way. mr. pick helps him down the steps.}
<C>__{mr. pick}
<D>__{that's it it's all right you've done very well.}
<A>__{mr. pick's voice is reassuring, though he has a dark, diabolic face. they're at the bottom of the staircase now, mr. pick leading his odd companion toward the exit. the odd companion lurches towards the dead anarchists, but mr. pick restrains him.}
<C>__{mr. pick}
<D>__{never mind them they'll be attended to.}
<B>__{kafka}
<A>__{pretending to be one of the dead anarchists. hiding under the large body of the bearded anarchist. trying hard to emulate his lack of movement. blood from the bearded anarchist's ear drips onto kafka's face. he tries to blink it away while his other eye remains fixed on the two figures walking away to the doorway until they're through it and gone. after a moment, he unloads the bearded anarchist and softly hurries over to the attic doorway.}
<B>__{stairs}
<A>__{the strange man utters another low moan as mr. pick leads him like a dog down the creaking old steps.}
<B>__{kafka}
<A>__{comes cautiously out onto the landing. he leans over the bannister, watching the two figures slowly going down the long stairs, vanishing from sight at a certain turn of the staircase on every floor and coming into view after a moment or so.}
