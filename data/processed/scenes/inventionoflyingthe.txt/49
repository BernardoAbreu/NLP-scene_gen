<C>__{mark }
<P>__{(writing)}
<D>__{i've discovered something today very important... and very powerful.}
<B>__{montage}
<A>__{mark doing various good deeds throughout the day. v.o plays throughout. marks walks up to the homeless man with the "i don't understand why i'm homeless and you are all not" sign. he says something to the homeless man, who quickly drops his sign and follows mark.}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{i'm as excited as i've ever been in my entire life, and equally scared. mark (v.o.) (cont'd) i'm writing this down in a letter in case this thing i've discovered somehow ends up killing me. i want to ensure that, even if i wasn't strong enough to use it, that my invention doesn't once again disappear, never to be discovered again.}
<A>__{mark and the homeless man are at the bank. mark is talking to the bank teller. the homeless man looks at mark nervously. the teller leaves and comes back with stacks and stacks of cash.}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{in just a few hours since i stumbled upon my discovery i have seen its potential for evil and i have seen its potential for good.}
<A>__{outside lecture films, mark talks to the woman who was adamant about not wanting to go to work. he whispers a few words into her ear. she smiles, picks up her briefcase and gladly walks into work.}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{i must be careful with my discovery, for at this point i barely understand it, let alone think i have the power to control it. all i know is that if i'm not careful i could easily do irreparable damage to the world, or even cause my own premature death.}
<A>__{mark walks up to the arguing couple at the coffee shop, who are now sitting at different tables, not even looking at each other. he pulls up a chair next to each of them, individually, and says a few words to them. within moments, the two of them are running into each other's arms and making out passionately on the floor of the coffee shop.}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{now, to explain my invention. in essence, my creation is the act of saying words that simply are not. for example, if i tell someone that my eyes are blue, then it simply becomes fact. i still know that, indeed, my eyes are brown, but no one else is aware of this fact, so therefore i have blue eyes. mark (v.o.) (cont'd) it's a game of numbers: there is only one of me who knows i have brown eyes, and so many of them who do not. the numbers always win.}
<A>__{mark is at the elderly home, walking the halls and whispering to his grandmother and each elderly person he passes, leaving each one of them with a smile upon their faces, and some with tears streaming down their cheeks.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{whoever is reading this, go ahead and try it. tell someone your eyes are a different color then they are. i think you'll be amazed at the results. it's so simple and yet... so powerful... this thing i've invented.}
<A>__{mark and frank are watching tv in mark's apartment. the two of them are drinking beers and having a good time watching television.}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{au revoir, future reader, au revoir.}
<A>__{mark signs his letter, seals it in an envelope, writes "my invention" on the outside of it and sticks it in a drawer in his kitchen.}
