<C>__{robin}
<D>__{he never answers.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{why does he have a lock on his door?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{because he put the lock on! do you think i told him he could have a nose ring?! why do you ask me everything you should ask him!? i don't know anything, anymore!}
<A>__{the boys line up against the edge of the pool and watch george extend the ladder against the house and climb.}
<C>__{robin }
<D>__{you climb up there and tell him what he can and can't do. take him for the summer, okay? whip him into shape. cut his hair. make him smile. let him hate you for a while!}
<P>__{(sadly)}
<D>__{you're too late for heroics, george.}
<A>__{george lops a leg over the railing and steps onto the bedroom balcony. he peers into the room through the sliding glass door and tries to open it (locked) before removing the screen to the small open window beside it. he climbs in.}
