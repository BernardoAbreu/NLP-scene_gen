<L>__{exterior havana country club close view day}
<A>__{some glasses; rum is poured into them; then coca cola. quarter limes are squeezed.}
<C>__{sam roth }
<D>__{rum... coca cola...a squeeze of fresh lime...}
<A>__{sam prepares the drinks for his brother, hyman, and a group of men, including michael.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{cuba libres.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i was told the cubans now call this drink: "la mentira."}
<C>__{roth}
<D>__{i still don't speak spanish, michael.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{it means... "the lie."}
<A>__{a moment's hesitation, then a few of the men laugh. now two cubans in white carry a table which has a lovely small cake on it.}
<C>__{sam roth}
<D>__{the cake is here.}
<A>__{they all raise their glasses to the old man.}
<C>__{everyone}
<P>__{(ad lib)}
<D>__{happy birthday!}
<A>__{roth glances at the cake and its inscription, is pleased.}
<C>__{roth}
<D>__{i hope my age is correct: i am always accurate about my age.}
<A>__{some laugh. he nods, and they begin to cut it, put a piece on plates, and carry them to the different men.}
<C>__{roth}
<D>__{everything we've learned in vegas is true here; but we can go further. the bigger, the swankier, the plusher the store, the more a sense of legitimacy, and the bigger business we do.}
<P>__{(looking at the plate brought to him)}
<D>__{a smaller piece. what we've proposed to the cuban government is that it put up half the cash on a dollar for dollar basis.}
<P>__{(accepting a smaller piece)}
<D>__{thank you. we can find people in the united states who will put up our share for a small piece of the action, yet we will retain control.}
<C>__{one of the men}
<D>__{how much?}
<C>__{roth}
<D>__{a hundred million dollars. but only if this government relaxes its restrictions on importing building materials; we'll need some new laws, too, but that will be no difficulty.}
<C>__{another man}
<D>__{what are import duties now?}
<C>__{roth}
<D>__{as much as seventy percent. also, i'm working out an arrangement with the minister of labor so that all our pit bosses, stick men and dealers, can be considered specialized technicians eligible for two year visas. as of now they're only allowed in cuba for six months at a time. in short, we're in a full partnership with the cuban government.}
<B>__{view on michael}
<A>__{is handed a piece of cake. roth moves over to a folder of documents.}
<C>__{roth}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{here are applications from friends all over the states. i understand santo virgilio in tampa is trying to make his own deal. well, the cuban government will brush him off. the lakeville road boys are going to take over the nacionale here. i'm planning a new hotel casino to be known as riviera. the new capri will go to the corleone family.}
<B>__{med. view}
<A>__{the cake is sliced and carried to each of the men.}
<C>__{roth}
<D>__{then there's the sevilla biltmore; the havana hilton, which is going to cost twenty four million cuban banks will put up half, the teamsters will bankroll the rest. generally, there will be friends for all our friends including the lieutenant governor of nevada; eddie levine of newport will bring in the pennino brothers, dino and eddie; they'll handle actual casino operations.}
<A>__{and seeing that all of his friends have been served, roth raises his fork.}
<C>__{roth}
<D>__{enjoy.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i saw an interesting thing today. a man was being arrested by the military police; probably an urban guerrilla. rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket, taking the command vehicle with him.}
<A>__{the various men look up as michael eats his cake, wondering what the point of it is.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{it occurred to me: the police are paid to fight, and the rebels are not.}
<C>__{sam roth}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{so, that occurred to me.}
<B>__{view on roth}
<A>__{he understands michael's point, if the others do not.}
<C>__{roth}
<D>__{this country has had rebels for the last fifty years; it's part of their blood. believe me, i know... i've been coming here since the twenties; we were running molasses out of havana when you were a baby. to trucks owned by your father.}
<P>__{(he chuckles warmly over the memory)}
<D>__{we'll talk when we're alone.}
<A>__{and he returns his attention to the men who are gathered with him on his birthday.}
