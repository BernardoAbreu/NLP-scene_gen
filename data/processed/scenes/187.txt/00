<A>__{on a pair of black dexter penny loafers diligently pedaling an old schwinn mountain bike. adjust angle now to meet the bicyclist... he's african american. anywhere from 33 to 40. wears wire rim glasses, a fresh white oxford shirt, creased slacks and a solid green tie. an unobtrusive figure, at once familiar and yet undiscerning. the type you'd pass on a sidewalk and never even notice. he's trevor garfield. adjust angle further now to reveal the upper promenade bike path and a dramatic view of lower manhattan behind him. morning sun glimmers off the trade center towers. trevor's shadow skitters along the wooden path, 160 ft. above the east river. a fat briefcase, strapped to the back of his bike, rocks back and forth as he pumps the pedals. from above now a sweeping view of trevor, alone on the bike path, a speck, suspended above a sea of rush hour traffic on the bridge below.}
