<C>__{wills}
<P>__{(lightly)}
<D>__{okay, i admit it, she interests me.}

<C>__{john}
<D>__{hey, they're bigger than you are!}
<A>__{john scoops both his daughters up in his arms and kisses them repeatedly. wills watches, his eyes filling with a vague, wistful envy. he sees sarah staring at him. she smiles sympathetically.}
