<A>__{it is carlos who has taken the picture. his smile at the sight of the children is no longer a subtle one. there is some secret enjoyment here. it's then, that he notices the two arabs tailing him. close on carlos he frowns. now what happens can be interpreted in one of two ways. carlos takes a turn down an alleyway that has at first a shop or two, and then is nothing but deserted and foreboding alley. he is either trying to shake the two arabs or he has just entered every tourist's nightmare: a deserted alley in a foreign country with two bad guys. he quickens his pace. the arabs do too. carlos now knows they're after him and he takes off running.}
