<L>__{exterior back porch night}
<A>__{amanda appears at the door. she unlatches it, stepping outside.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{zowie?}
<A>__{amanda looks down and screams.}
<L>__{interior drew's room night}
<A>__{photos of drew with zowie are tacked on the wall above the bed. the one photo of drew, amanda and gus has been altered with a cut out head of zowie's pasted on gus' shoulders. we find drew below. he's fallen asleep with his walkman on. even with his ears covered, the pounding at the door jolts him awake. half asleep, drew peels off the headphones.}
<C>__{gus }
<D>__{drew, you unlock this door! right now!}
<C>__{amanda }
<D>__{unlock it, drew!}
<A>__{the anger in his mother's voice brings him off the bed. gus' pounding continues. drew moves to the door. the inside is secured by a double dead bolt. instead of unlocking them, he opens a tiny, customized window which gives him a view of the hall.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{what did i do now?}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{open the door, drew.}
<A>__{drew unlatches the deadbolts and steps back as gus bursts through the door.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{where do you come off lying like that? "i'm burying my dog." you think a lie like that's never gonna catch up to you?}
<A>__{drew backs into the bed, taking a seat. amanda comes through the door, and behind her is...}
<B>__{zowie}
<A>__{this is our first glimpse of the resurrected dog. fur shiny and wet, the gaping gunshot wound in his rear. zowie's head hangs low, his eyes gleaming red. the husky is covered with dirt from head to toe. drew's eyes widen in astonishment. zowie staggers across the room towards drew, nails clicking on the floorboards. drew shrinks back in uncertain horror as the dog moves closer. zowie absently throws his arms up onto the bed, across drew's lap. and slowly, perfunctory, his tongue licks drew's cheek. this last action of zowie displaces drew's fear. tears well up in the boy's eyes.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(a whisper)}
<D>__{zowie...}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{say your goodbyes. zowie's going outside. you're grounded, buddy. that's the new law.}
<A>__{drew lifts his hand from stroking zowie's fur. his palm is covered with muddy blood.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{i never knew an open wound could smell so bad...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{honey, he should have been looked at this morning. i don't know what you were thinking. it's a wonder he's still alive.}
<A>__{drew gazes into the dog's vacant eyes. it truly is a wonder.}
