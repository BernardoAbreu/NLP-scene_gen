<L>__{exterior park day}
<A>__{michael is sitting on a bench facing the grass, with his back to us, he seems quite busy. as we close in, we discover that he has opened the box of diapers and that he's holding one of them; its plastic has been carefully cut out with scissors. casually, glancing right and left, he takes the individ ual packets of white powder out of his pocket and shoves them into a little plastic bag from the supermarket. then he carefully tapes the bag so it's well sealed and flattened out, and he inserts it into the diaper, be tween the plastic and the absorbent fabric. next, the diaper is taped up, folded back up and put back in the box, neatly packed between the other ones. michael closes the box again and glues it together so it looks as if it's never been opened. he throws all the other stuff away in a trash can and grabs hold of his brand new box of diapers. he walks away.}
