<A>__{fred puts the pistol up against mr. eddy laurent's head and marches him out of the room past the camera's eye. the camera stays in the room and moves slowly toward the window, through which we see fred and mr. eddy laurent appear down below in the back lot. still watching out the window, the camera sees fred knock mr. eddy laurent over the head with the gun butt and put him into the trunk of a car. fred slams the trunk lid and climbs into the driver's side of what is obviously mr. eddy laurent's car the mercedes 600 pullman. as fred drives away, a hand appears in our window foreground. the hand moves the window curtain further to one side. the camera pulls back to reveal it as the hand of the mystery man. the mystery man leans fully into the frame and watches fred drive off down the lost highway as day breaks.}
