<A>__{evey is wearing a blindfold and v leads her by her fingertips, guiding her almost as if they were dancing... his fingers slip free of her and she reaches out.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{wait. i've lost you.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{no, you haven't.}
<A>__{he is behind her and he removes the blindfold, revealing his house to her.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{oh...}
<A>__{it is a labyrinth of interconnecting underground tunnels and rooms. the gallery is the main room as it is filled with an amazing collection of human culture. there is art that spans from the renaissance to the painted covers of eerie comics, literature that ranges from shakespeare to spillane, philosophy from plato to bukowski, and a vast collection of nonfiction. there are movie posters everywhere and an entire wall is lined with videocassettes. a jukebox stands in front of an enormous vinyl and cd collection of music.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{a jukebox? where did you get it?}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{i saved it. like everything here.}
<A>__{she punches a button and billie holiday begins to sing.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{oh, it's beautiful. i've never heard anything like it.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{of course not. you grew up in their world. art is created by individuals and there are no individuals in a world where you are told what to think.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{this place is amazing.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{you're welcome to stay.}
<A>__{she stops suddenly and looks at him. the offer is terribly exciting but it is so unlike anything she has ever done that it's almost impossible to imagine.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{stay here... with you?}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{yes. if you like.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{i... i don't even know your name.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{i don't have a name. but you can call me v.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{v? v... i like that.}
<A>__{and she returns his smile.}
