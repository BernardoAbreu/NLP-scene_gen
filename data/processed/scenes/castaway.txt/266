<L>__{interior dentist waiting room}
<A>__{typical dentist waiting room. chairs, tropical fish tanks, magazines, a few waiting patients...and kelly, looking nervous. slowly and painfully chuck enters. he's quite a sight. she stands up. there's a long moment where they look at each other. then she comes into his arms. holds him tight. she's part laughing, part crying.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i'm sorry... i'm sorry...}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{hey...hey...it's okay!}
<A>__{chuck is happy, he's still riding the high.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{you're so thin. am i hurting you?}
<A>__{well, maybe a little, but who cares? he hasn't been hugged or barely touched in so long.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{no...no...feels good...}
<A>__{she disengages, looks at him with that old smile.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{right back, you said you'd be right back.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{a few things came up. or went down.}
<A>__{he meets her gaze, looks her over with a smile.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{you look...wonderful. i like your hair.}
<A>__{he notices the ring on her hand.}
<C>__{kelly}

<D>__{if i'd known you were alive }
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i would have done the same thing.}
<A>__{his responses come so quick. chuck seems blissfully sure of himself.}
<C>__{kelly}

<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{life's just one big joke after another.}
<A>__{stan appears, takes in the scene. the few patients waiting are edged into the corners, trying to look occupied with something else.}
<C>__{stan}

<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{want to see my raft?}
