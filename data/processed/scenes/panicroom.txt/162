<A>__{sarah begins to convulse, she bucks right out of meg's arms and falls back onto the floor of the panic room. meg clears everything away from her, tries to make room for her. the convulsion worsens. meg searches through the piles of supplies, comes up with a plastic handled screwdriver. she opens sarah's jaws, wedges the plastic handle between her teeth. she helps sarah ride out the convulsion. finally, her eyes roll back into her head, she slowly re orients herself. sarah reaches over, turns off her still beeping wristwatch monitor herself. sarah sighs, a shuddering sigh of relief, but she is nowhere near normal. her skin has passed through white and is turning a sallow yellow color. she moves her lips, meg can't hear her, she bends down:}

<A>__{meg turns, looks back at the monitors. what she sees is good news on the monitors, the jacket has been removed from the bedroom camera. burnham and raoul are gone, the only person there is harris, who lies slumped on the far side of the bed. in the panic room, meg looks quickly over at the monitor for the living room. on that monitor, she sees burnham and raoul having an urgent conversation, burnham sitting in a chair, raoul pacing in front of him, ranting. in the panic room, meg's face lights up, she practically laughs, she's so overjoyed at this turn of events. she turns, looks back at sarah, who is starting to tremble again. that does it. meg leaps up, hits the button that controls the steel door, and it starts to crank open, almost impossibly slowly.}
