<T>__{says seriously:}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{are you depressed?}
<A>__{suzy bites her fingernails. she shrugs.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{how come?}
<A>__{pause. suzy says philosophically:}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{well, i can show you an example, if you want but it doesn't make me feel very good. i found this on top of our refrigerator.}
<A>__{suzy looks into her leather folder and shuffles through some pages. she withdraws a small pamphlet.}
<T>__{insert:}
<A>__{the cover of the pamphlet. there is a drawing of a broken tea cup and the title "coping with the very troubled child". sam frowns. his eyes widen.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{does that mean you?}
<A>__{suzy nods. sam explodes with laughter.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{it's not funny.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{to me, it is.}
<A>__{sam slaps his knee and shakes his head. pause. suzy dumps her fish into the campfire and throws her metal plate like a frisbee into a tree trunk. it bounces off with a ding. she stands up and says coolly:}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{you really know how to make friends.}
<A>__{suzy walks away. she goes behind a bush and sits down on a rock. she starts to cry. sam looks stricken and confused. he is very still. he gets up slowly. he tentatively approaches the bush. he looks behind it. he takes two steps closer. he stands above suzy. he unties his neckerchief, crouches down, and holds it out.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{suzy looks to sam. she hesitates. she takes the neckerchief.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{that's ok.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm on your side.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{suzy dries her eyes. she unfolds the neckerchief and studies its design. it is a brave shooting an arrow while leaning off the side of a galloping horse. sam motions to the books:}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{which one's the best?}
