<L>__{interior hospital room morning}
<A>__{the black orderly hustles in with david's breakfast tray, busily setting up the tray on the table over the bed. he awakens the sleeping david with his activity.}
<C>__{orderly}
<D>__{ah you're up. good morning and a good day to you. we've quite a meal for you here this morning. bacon, oatmeal, orange juice, and toast with jam. good stuff there. now eat it up and i will be back for the dishes when you've finished.}
<A>__{the orderly exits. the drowsy david, who has been trying to fully wake up during the orderly's speech, notices his exit.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{good morning.}
<A>__{he looks at his food none too happily. he sticks a spoon into the bowl of oatmeal and tastes is gingerly.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(in mock english accent)}
<D>__{please, sir, i want some more.}
<A>__{he settles down to eating, reaches over to butter his toast and drink his juice. while he eats, we hear jack's o.s. voice.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{can i have a piece of toast?}
<A>__{david looks over to the o.s. jack. jack, behaving relaxed and normal, sits in the chair last occupied by alex. however, jack's appearance makes his casual manner all the more surreal. he is as we left him butchered on the moors. he is covered with dried mud and open wounds. huge glistening gashes abound on his body. his face is scratched, his throat is badly torn, and his hair is matted with blood. in several spots he has already begun to rot. he is a remarkably gruesome sight, but his physical state seems not to affect him at all.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(pleasantly)}
<D>__{nice to see you.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(unbelieving)}
<D>__{get the fuck out of here, jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{thanks a lot.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(horrified)}
<D>__{this is too much. i can't handle this.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm aware that i don't look so great, but i thought you'd be glad to see me.}
<A>__{jack gets up and takes a piece of toast from david's tray as david watches amazed. jack returns to his seat and takes a bite out of his toast. david stares at jack horrified.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{david! you're hurting my feelings.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(astounded)}
<D>__{hurting your feelings? has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? listen to me, i'm talking to a hamburger!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm sorry to be upsetting you, david, but i had to come.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(aghast)}
<D>__{aren't you supposed to be buried in new york someplace?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah. your parents came to my funeral. i was surprised at how many people came.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(resigned)}
<D>__{why should you be surprised? you were a very well liked person.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{debbie klein cried a lot.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i can't stand it.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{so you know what she does? she's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in rudy levine's bed.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{rudy levine the shmuck?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{life mocks me even in death.}
<A>__{jack takes another bite of toast.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{i'm going completely crazy.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(loud)}
<D>__{david!}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{david, now i know this may be hard for you, but i have to warn you.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{warn me? will you get out of here, you meat loaf?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm a grisly sight, it's true; but i love you and that's why i'm here. you've got to know.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{if you love me so much, jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{we were attacked by a werewolf.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(covers his ears)}
<D>__{i'm not listening!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{on the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{shut up, you zombie!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i was murdered, an unnatural death, and now i walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(incredulous, furious)}
<D>__{what's wrong with you? shut up!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{the wolf's bloodline must be severed. the last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{will you be quiet?!}
<A>__{jack rises and comes closer to david.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it's you, david.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you survived and now you shall continue the curse.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what are you talking about? i won't accept this! get out! god damit!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{remember what that guy at the slaughtered lamb said? `beware the moon.'}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{stop it, jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{beware the moon. the full moon, david. you've got two days.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{jack, please go away. please go away.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you'll stalk the streets of london a creature of the night.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(flares up)}
<D>__{you're talking like boris karloff! it's movie dialogue!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{david, please believe me. you will kill people, david. you've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(yells)}
<D>__{nurse!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{listen to me! take your own life, david. it's our only chance.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{nurse!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{the supernatural! the powers of darkness! it's all true. take your own life! suicide, david. join me.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(losing it)}
<D>__{nurse! oh god! alex!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it's cold, david, and i'm so alone. the undead surround me. have you ever talked to a corpse? it's boring! i'm lonely! kill yourself, david, before you kill others.}
