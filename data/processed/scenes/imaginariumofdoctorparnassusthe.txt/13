<T>__{cut to diego :}
<A>__{who is in a state of confusion and terror. is he lost inside a video game he can't control? he presses the buttons on his gaming device to no avail. one of the bridges leads to a bluff where war games are under way... all very video game like. thrilling aggressive music blares forth. mr nick appears, still in red waist coat and bowler hat, but this time in the form of a cut out shooting target with a bull's eye on his chest.}
<C>__{mr nick}
<D>__{come on laddy, cross the bridge! join up! be a man. kill the enemy. impress your dad. unlimited ammo. great fun. pow! pow! pow!}
<A>__{as he speaks bullets fly. each time mr.nick gets shot and is knocked flat, he pops back up continuing his spiel. the other bridge appears to be made of black and white piano keys and looks very rickety and unsafe. the piano key bridge descends into a great cavern where hundreds of boy and girl pianists are practising on hundreds of pianos, all playing the same tune the tune dr. parnassus is humming, but with stern, demanding, piano teachers in attendance.}
<C>__{piano teachers}
<D>__{no, no, start again! again! from the top! again! practice! practice!}
<A>__{diego doesn't know what to do. behind him rises a strange mongolfier balloon. dr. parnassus's face is repeated again and again around its circumference. anton's in the basket. diego catches sight of anton.}
<C>__{diego}
<D>__{help!}
<P>__{(indicating gaming device)}
<D>__{it doesn't work! it's broken!}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{diego}
<D>__{the game!}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{what g g game?}
<C>__{diego}
<D>__{the game! the video game! the one we're in!}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{i d d don't know what you're t t talking about.}
<C>__{diego}
<D>__{help me!}
<C>__{anton}
<P>__{(miserable )}
<D>__{i c can't.}
<C>__{diego}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{i'm n not supposed to be here.}
<C>__{diego}
<D>__{what am i going to do?}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{that's the p pointerior it's up to you.}
<C>__{diego}
<P>__{(dismayed)}
<D>__{but... don't leave me! don't let me die!}
<A>__{but anton has gone. diego, terrified, tests the bridge to the war games.}
<C>__{mr nick}
<D>__{attaboy, sonny. join the men. nothing to it. hup two, hup two...}
<A>__{he hesitates...the music from the pianos seems to have an effect on him. he comes to a decision. he drops his gaming device then very hesitantly steps onto the extremely wobbly piano keys. the cut out shooting target mr nick isn't happy.}
<C>__{mr nick }
<D>__{no, wait! that's the wrong choice! that bridge leads to failure and despair. you'll be dead before you're thirty. this is the one. this is the bridge to manhood!}
<A>__{diego looks uncertain, unnerved. for a moment we think he might change his mind, but he presses bravely on across the piano bridge.}
