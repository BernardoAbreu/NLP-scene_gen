<L>__{interior maddy's caravan. evening}
<A>__{a woodburning stove with a single cooking plate on which pieces of the goat meat, sprinkled with herbs, are sizzling in a pan. inman is eating like a man possessed, wrapping the meat in corn fritters and pushing them into his mouth. maddy watches him, adds another mound of meat to his plate. inman nods in thanks, but doesn't look up. she opens a jar and takes out a handful of dried poppy heads, puts them near the stove, then dips into another jar and pulls out what look like old cheroot stubs.}
<C>__{maddy}
<D>__{take one of these now with your food.}
<A>__{inman is circumspect, views the stub lozenge with suspicion.}
<C>__{maddy}
<D>__{swallow it. if you die i will give you your money back.}
<A>__{inman puts it in his mouth, gags at the taste of it. she hands him a beaker with milk to wash it down.}
<C>__{maddy}
<D>__{our minds aren't made to hold on to the particulars of pain, the way we do bliss.}
<A>__{she starts steaming the poppies.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{it's true...}
<C>__{maddy}
<D>__{what is?}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{what you remember.}
<C>__{maddy}
<D>__{what's her name?}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{ada.}
<P>__{(at the food)}
<D>__{ sometimes i think i'm crazy when i'm just hungry }
<P>__{(another mouthful)}
<D>__{ada monroe.}
<C>__{maddy}
<D>__{and is she waiting for you?}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{she was. i don't know. or if she'd know me. i'm like the boy who goes out in winter for firewood comes back in the spring with a whistle.}
<A>__{maddy pricks open the poppies and collects their opium, then hands inman the liquid.}
<C>__{maddy}
<D>__{now drink this. it visits the pain. and you'll sleep.}
<A>__{he drinks the laudanum she's made.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{i've had to put myself in the way of people's kindness.}
<C>__{maddy}
<D>__{i hope you found it.}
<A>__{she dips a cloth in the steaming water, unbuttons his shirt. she has a crock of what looks like treacle and vaseline. she smears this salve over the neck wound and into his scalp. inman surrenders to the drug.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{the passenger pigeons fly south, the berries ripen. whether i see them or not, whether a man dies, or a war is won.}
<C>__{maddy}
<D>__{that's the laudanum getting to you. that's good. say something more.}
<P>__{(she kneels to his leg)}
<D>__{raise that up for me.}
<A>__{he obliges. she grimaces at the state of it, where the chain has chewed into the flesh. gets to work.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{she gave me a book. ada monroe. man by the name of bartram. wrote about his travels. i carried that book through every battle. i left it someplace, got to get it back. sometimes just reading the name of a place near home sorell cove, fire scale ridge was enough to bring me to tears. thing is i've been thinking those places belonged to people before us, to the indian and he had a different name. what did he call sorell cove? how can a name not even the real name break your heart? it's her, she's the place i'm heading. and i hardly know her. so how can a person who's maybe not even a real person i don't know what i'm talking about i have to close my eyes...}
<A>__{he slides off the stool and lays on the floor. maddy goes over to her cot and pulls off a blanket which she drapes over him.}
