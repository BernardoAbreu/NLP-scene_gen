<L>__{exterior beach day}
<A>__{using a safety pin and some suturing thread, chuck fishes carefully. suddenly he jerks his hand back. on the end is a flopping fish.}
<L>__{exterior palm grove day}
<A>__{chuck takes a cooked fish off the fire and mixes it with some breadfruit. he eats the soft mixture, chewing carefully, but his tooth hurts even worse. there are only a few tylenol tablets left. he carefully cuts one in half and swallows it.}
<L>__{exterior summit afternoon}
<A>__{chuck arrives with the wood for the night. he stares out to sea as usual, but this time he sees something different. whales. he sees whales. leaping. broaching. spouting. water pouring off fins and flukes. moving. going somewhere.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{beautiful. so beautiful.}
<A>__{chuck stares at them, stares until the ocean darkens and he can see them no more. it's late now. leaving, he takes one last look, as he always does. and another remarkable sight greets his eyes. there, on the horizon, just below the evening star, is a...light. he stares at it, fixed.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{a star. it's a star.}
<A>__{but then he stares at it really hard.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{it's a ship.}
