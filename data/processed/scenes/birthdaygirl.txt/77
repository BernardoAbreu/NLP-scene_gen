<A>__{john rests his head against the doorframe and heaves a sigh of relief. he turns and freezes. nadia is there next to him. she slowly loosens his tie. holding it in her hands she examines the strange little bank logo on it, before deliberately tying the tie over her mouth like a gag. a second tie is pulled from a hanger in the cupboard. quickly and skillfully she ties her hands together, pulling it tight with her teeth. finished, she flicks her hair back, and gives him a long, level look.}
