<L>__{intercut carrie and pryce:}
<A>__{carrie eyeballs a snowcat. it's door is slightly open. she heads for it. gun poised. pryce moves to check the next plane. eyes dart to every dark corner. carrie gets to the cat. springs toward the door. inside's empty. pryce walks under the wing of the next plane. spots delfy just ahead on the ground by the tool chest. looks like he's stirring into consciousness. then swoosh!! an ice axe swings down from above, embedding in his pryce's chest. deep. it sticks. gun goes flying. keller drops down from the wing above. pryce staggers. keller kicks him hard. pryce goes down. keller grabs the gun. points it right at pryce before he can shoot bang!bang! bullets zip by keller, who rolls for cover behind some equipment. another rips into his shoulder. keller spots carrie over by the cat. she fires continually, forcing him to stay behind cover. the shots go wide she's not yet used to firing with the right hand. keller blindly reaches his gun around the chest shoots back, which gives pryce enough time to painfully crawl for cover beneath the plane. he's losing blood quick. carrie keeps shooting. bullets ping off the tool chest. they stop. carrie has to reload. keller makes his move. fires at carrie and sprints for his plane. runs right by pole with a large red button attached to it. slams it.}
<B>__{hangar doors begin to rumble open}
<A>__{the temperature immediately begins to plummet as winter is let inside. keller keeps shooting. runs out of bullets. leaps into the idling otter. carrie makes her move. dashes toward him, firing away. bullets plant in the windshield, but can't penetrate glass is too thick protection from the cold. keller throttles. begins to move the otter forward toward the opening doors. carrie dashes to pryce. sees delfy get to his feet. face bloody. he moves to pryce. she gets over to the guys quickly, giving delfy a visual once over. he'll be fine, but things look bad for pryce. he's bleeding profusely. she kneels beside him pulls the tip of the axe out of his chest. delfy looks to the hangar doors, which are nearly open.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{...i didn't see him.}
<A>__{his eyes flutter shut. carrie slaps his face }
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{no! you stay awake!}
<A>__{puts her hand directly on the wound. applies pressure. blood continues to ooze. she looks over to keller just as his plane exits the hangar. looks back to pryce's wound won't stop bleeding.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{damn it!}
<P>__{(to delfy)}
<D>__{come on. we're getting him up.}
<A>__{they lift him to his feet. haul ass to the front of the hangar the best they can. go outside.}
