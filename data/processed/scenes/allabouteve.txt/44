<P>__{(declaiming)}
<D>__{"... my hat which has, lo, these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to miss harrington. i am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops." ... i thought that one went out with woollcott...}
<P>__{(she skips part of the column)}
<D>__{down here... here, listen to this "... miss harrington had much to tell and these columns shall report her faithfully about the lamentable practice in our theater of permitting, shall we say mature actresses to continue playing roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory "}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i just can't believe it.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{it get better! " about the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched first ladies of the stage to encourage, shall we say younger actresses; about miss harrington's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity "}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i can't believe eve said those things!}
<A>__{margo crumples the paper as if it were eve's neck.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(pacing)}
<D>__{in this rat race, everybody's guilty till they're proved innocent! one of the differences between the theater and civilization...}
