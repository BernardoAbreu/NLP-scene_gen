<C>__{adele }
<D>__{when we were kids, my dad was mayor, and you and me and a bunch of others used to come down here all the time.}
<B>__{on adele and luke}
<A>__{looking up at the statue in this city hall basement storage room, lit only by a single shaft of moonlight from the window. the muslin covering lay bunched at their feet.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(looks at the door)}
<D>__{how'd they get it inside?}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{through the door. it comes apart.}
<A>__{she moves to the memorial. squinting, she examines its base.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{your name's on here. see?}
<A>__{luke comes over. on the base of the memorial luke's name}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{right here. "albert lucas trumbo." and all the others. i knew them all. so did you. we went to school with most of them.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{it doesn't seem right, this being down here. it ought to be where people can see it.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{after they commissioned it, no one could ever agree on where to put it. the methodists wanted it in front of the methodist church, the presbyterians wanted it in front of the presbyterian church, the city council wanted it in the lobby of city hall. everyone finally got tired of the fighting. so they stuck it down here.}
<A>__{he looks at her for a long moment. there's an electricity between them, and they both feel it.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{so, you're really gonna be a lawyer?}
<C>__{adele}
<P>__{(suddenly defensive)}
<D>__{and why not?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{whoa.}
<C>__{adele}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{sorry. you don't know how many times i've heard that. "a lady lawyer? are you crazy?" like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man. or better, in fact.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{have you always wanted to be a lawyer?}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{you... don't remember, but yes, ever since i was a little girl.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what did... what did i want to be?}
<C>__{adele}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{oh, well... i guess you... in high school, you were a pretty good first baseman. and we were on the debate team together. but... i think you were gonna run the bijou. you were brought up there, and you loved it so much. and i think you knew how much the town needed a place like that.}
<A>__{he turns away, rubs his head.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i just wish i could remember some of this.}
<A>__{he turns back to her.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{actually, i was married. for four years. but... well, we didn't fit together. i'm divorced now.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{no, it's okay. see, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... i'm not making sense, am i?}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(moving toward her)}
<D>__{no, you are. i know exactly what you mean. it's not that you're missing something. it's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. you just didn't see it until they came along.}
<C>__{adele}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{yeah...}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{we were in love... weren't we?}
<C>__{adele}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(then:)}
<D>__{hic!}
<A>__{she instantly covers her mouth, but it's no good. she has the hiccups again.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{adele}
<P>__{nothing. (hic!)}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{do you have the...}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{i'm (hic!) fine. really. (hic!)}
<A>__{luke smiles and watches adele as she makes the decision to not struggle against the hiccups. she has them, and that's just the way it is.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{were we going to get married?}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{eventually. we were going to be}
<P>__{(hic!) engaged... when you came}
<D>__{back from (hic!) overseas...}
<A>__{he looks at her. she's strikingly beautiful at this particular moment and in this particular light hiccups and all. he moves closer to her. she moves closer to him.}
<C>__{adele}
<P>__{(breathless)}
<D>__{... but you had to go... serve}
<P>__{(hic!) your country...}
<A>__{they kiss passionately. she reaches up and puts her arms around him. he starts kissing her neck, and she suddenly realizes she's stopped hiccuping.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{hey... it worked.}
<A>__{and as she smiles and kisses him again we}
