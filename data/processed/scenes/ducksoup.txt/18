<P>__{(to phone)}
<D>__{send in the next girl.}
<P>__{(he hangs receiver up)}
<C>__{groucho}
<D>__{by the way, are you sure we need a spy?}
<C>__{chico}
<D>__{sure, we gotta have a spy. if we no got a spy who's gonna tell the other side what we're doing?}
<A>__{at this point, harpo makes his entrance through the door, carrying his unusually large pocketbook which is about the size of a carpetbag. he walks past groucho in a seductive manner, swinging his bag and rolling his eyes flirtatiously. groucho is delighted with this action and returns the ogling.}
<C>__{chico}
<P>__{(to harpo)}
<D>__{have you got any credentials?}
<A>__{harpo lifts his dress and shows them the tattoo on his leg of the two hearts. groucho examines it closely.}
<C>__{groucho}
<D>__{i don't go in much for modern art. have you got anything by one of the old masters?}
<A>__{harpo lifts his dress above the other leg and shows a picture of gainsborough's "blue boy". chico and groucho arise from the examination.}
<C>__{groucho}
<D>__{i'm glad i didn't ask you for "washington crossing the delaware".}
<C>__{chico}
<P>__{(to harpo)}
<D>__{we've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men. you know how to make love?}
<A>__{harpo walks over to chico, throws his arms around him and starts to give him a big hug. he squeezes him very hard. in the midst of this there is a loud report. a startled look from groucho and chico. we see that harpo is minus one breast. he tries to affect an innocent look when suddenly there is a second loud report and his breasts are now as flat as a billiard table. just as he turns to hide the sight from chico and groucho, a hissing sound is heard the air is leaking out of his bustle and the bustle is becoming deflated.)}
<C>__{groucho}
<P>__{(to harpo)}
<D>__{you ought to carry a spare.}
<A>__{harpo goes to a corner of the room and keeps his back to camera. he takes a tube out of his dress front and begins to blow. chico and groucho wear a puzzled look as they watch him the bustle starts to expand. this inflation continues to gigantic proportions as they look on.}
<C>__{groucho}
<P>__{(looking at harpo)}
<D>__{we're certainly living in a marvelous age.}
<A>__{there is a terrific explosion and all of harpo's clothes are blown off him leaving him in nothing but running pants and ladies' silk stockings. his body is literally covered with tattoos.}
<C>__{chico}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{that's very funny... he certainly fooled me. he'll make a good spy.}
<A>__{winks significantly at harpo. harpo returns the wink.}
<C>__{groucho}
<P>__{(examining tattoos)}
<D>__{if we can't use him as a spy, we can have him framed.}
<A>__{he and chico continue further examination of the tattooed designs on harpo's body.}
<C>__{chico}
<D>__{say, that's a nice collection. you oughta have a catalogue.}
<A>__{harpo pulls a catalogue from under the belt of his trunks and hands it to chico. groucho and chico look at the catalogue.}
<C>__{groucho}
<D>__{let's take a look at number eighteen.}
<A>__{harpo reveals more of his back and shows a superb tattooed job of a beautiful girl's head.}
<C>__{chico}
<P>__{(referring to picture of girl)}
<D>__{say, she's all right. you got a her phone number?}
<A>__{harpo raises one arm and shows the phone number tattooed right under the arm pit. he holds this a moment, then turns and discloses a portion of the tattooing on his chest. groucho and chico's eyes shift from the telephone number to the tattooed picture on his chest. harpo completes move and discloses the entire picture. it is a country back house with a crescent over the door. chico laughs uproariously.}
<C>__{chico}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{that's a funny one!}
<A>__{he slaps harpo an the back good naturedly. trick shot on harpo's chest. the door in the outhouse flies open. the head of a real man appears in the opening. he looks off in the direction of chico and mumbles incoherencies under his breath. he is terribly angry at being interrupted. he draws in his head, closing the door behind him.}
<C>__{chico}
<P>__{(to harpo)}
<D>__{i think we can use you. here's a spy glass... go ahead and do some spying...}
<A>__{harpo takes the glasses and goes directly toward the window. as he looks across street through binoculars, he is grinning all over and wiggling around like a happy kid.}
<B>__{room across the street}
<A>__{looking into the open window of a bedroom as harpo would see it through the binoculars. a beautiful girl is undressing, preparing to retire. after a moment of this shot cut back : to harpo looking through the binoculars. chico takes the binoculars from harpo and pushes him out of the scene, proceeds to look himself. he registers the same satisfaction as harpo and hands the binoculars to groucho. as groucho looks through the binoculars at the beautiful girl, chico says:}
<C>__{chico}
<D>__{he's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.}
<C>__{groucho}
<P>__{(turning and looking at chico)}
<D>__{that's not bad for any day.}
<A>__{groucho takes a second look through the binoculars at the beautiful girl. this time he sees harpo chasing the girl around the roam. this is shot through the binoculars as before. groucho registers amazement as he looks through binoculars; perhaps squints his eyes once or twice and takes second look.}
<C>__{groucho}
<P>__{(to chico)}
<D>__{maybe my eyes are bad you take a look.}
<A>__{chico takes the binoculars and looks at the room across the street. binocular shot as before. the girl is in her underwear, tearing out of the room into the hall, pursued by harpo. chico is still looking through the binoculars.}
<C>__{groucho}
<D>__{you're right about that guy i think we've got something.}
<C>__{chico}
<D>__{i don't know about us, but i know he's a got something...}
