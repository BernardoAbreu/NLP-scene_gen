<L>__{int exteriorhazel's car moments later}
<A>__{hazel drives like a maniac down the street, eventually finding herself at the speedway gas station. gus's car is alone in the parking lot and she pulls up next to it. she gets out of her car, opens his driver's side door, and finds him sitting there, his shirt stained with vomit and blood. she gags from the smell.}
<C>__{gus}
<P>__{(mumbling)}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{hazel looks down at his hands which are pressed tightly to his belly. she sees something is leaking from the tube sticking out of it.}
<C>__{hazel}
<P>__{(panicked)}
<D>__{oh, god, augustus, i'm calling 911.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{no! please! hazel, listen to me. do not call 911 or my parents i will never forgive you don't, please.}
<A>__{gus starts to cry.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{please just look at it.}
<A>__{hazel lifts up his shirt. his abdomen is bright red.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i think it's infected...}
<A>__{hazel feels his forehead, he's burning up.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{gus, what the why are you here? why aren't you home?}
<A>__{gus throws up. he doesn't even have the energy to turn his mouth away from his lap.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{oh, sweetie...}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i wanted to buy some cigarettes. i lost my pack. or they took it.}
<C>__{gus }
<D>__{i don't know. they said they'd get me another one but i wanted... to do it myself. do one little thing myself.}
<A>__{hazel doesn't know what to do.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i can't fix this. i have to call someone. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{no, hazel, please!}
<A>__{but she must. she gets out her cell phone and dials. at which point, gus really loses it, weeping like the poisoned, dying teenage boy that he is. as hazel dials, we hear:}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{i wish i could say augustus waters kept his sense of humor till the end, did not for a moment waiver in his courage and his spirit soared like an eagle to the sky...}
<C>__{gus}
<P>__{(to himself, shaking)}
<D>__{i hate myself i hate myself i hate this i hate this...}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{...but that is not what happened.}
<A>__{later. an emt loads gus into the back of an ambulance. hazel is allowed to ride with him in the back. as the car starts moving, gus grabs her hand.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{read me something.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{read you something?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{do you know any poems?}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i know one.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{read it to me.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{"the red wheelbarrow" by william carlos williams.}
<P>__{(beat, tries to remember)}
<D>__{"so much depends upon a red wheel barrow glazed with rain water beside the white chickens."}
<C>__{gus}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{is that it?}
<A>__{that is it. but there's another ten minutes of driving to do. hazel thinks fast.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{no of course not. um... what else...}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{so much depends upon a blue sky cut open by the branches of the trees. so much depends on the transparent g tube erupting from the belly of the blue lipped boy.}
<A>__{gus smiles, weakly, barely conscious. hazel cradles his head in her arms. and continues...}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{so much depends upon this observer of the universe...}
<A>__{as gus is drifting off to sleep, we hear:}
<C>__{hazel }
<D>__{one of the less bull shitty conventions of the cancer genre is the convention known as the "last good day..."}
