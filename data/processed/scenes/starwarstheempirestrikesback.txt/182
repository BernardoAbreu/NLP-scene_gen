<L>__{exterior dagobah bog clearing day}
<A>__{in the clearing behind yoda's house, luke again stands upside down, but his face shows less strain and more concentration than before. yoda sits on the ground below the young warrior. on the other side of the clearing, two equipment cases slowly rise into the air. nearby artoo watches, humming to himself, when suddenly he, too, rises into the air. his little legs kick desperately and his head turns frantically, looking for help.}
<C>__{yoda}
<D>__{concentrate... feel the force flow. yes. good. calm, yes. through the force, things you will see. other places. the future... the past. old friends long gone.}
<A>__{luke suddenly becomes distressed.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{han! leia!}
<A>__{the two packing boxes and artoo fall to the ground with a crash, then luke himself tumbles over.}
<C>__{yoda}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{hmm. control, control. you must learn control.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i saw... i saw a city in the clouds.}
<C>__{yoda}
<D>__{mmm. friends you have there.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{they were in pain.}
<C>__{yoda}
<A>__{it is the future you see.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{future? will they die?}
<A>__{yoda closes his eyes and lowers his head.}
<C>__{yoda}
<D>__{difficult to see. always in motion is the future.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i've got to go to them.}
<C>__{yoda}
<D>__{decide you must how to serve them best. if you leave now, help them you could. but you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.}
<A>__{luke is stopped cold by yoda's words. gloom shrouds him as he nods his head sadly.}
