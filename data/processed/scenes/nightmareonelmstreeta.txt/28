<L>__{interior tina's bedroom. night.}
<A>__{rod lurches up into close up in the lightless bedroom, half awakened by the tremendous struggle somewhere, somehow inside the dark bed. rod grabs groggily, lifting the blanket. in his pov we glimpse the dark underside of the blanket see two shadowy figures flailing and clawing under the bedspread tina and the man or a shape that could be a man raging against each other. rod drops the blanket and leaps from the bed, scared full awake and terrified. then the horrible tina's gasps change to the cries of a terribly wounded victim. rod instantly jerks back the bedspread. in his pov we see tina struggling and flailing along on the sheets, the man nowhere in sight.}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{t tina!?}
<A>__{suddenly tina eyes turned inward to her tormentor give an awful jolt her arms and legs are spraddled as if by overwhelming force and pinned to the bed. next instant, her nightgown flies apart and four long gashes chase across her torso. from no visible instruments! a huge irrigation of blood floods the bed. terrified, rod dives for the light but at the same moment something invisible grabs tina, wielding her body in the air and bringing it around in a swift blow that knocks rod crashing into the light smashing it to bits. closer on him as he struggles around. in the blue flashes of electricity rod sees tina sliding up the bedroom wall in a dark smear, dragged feet first ! angle on rod paralized by terror! angle on tina's dying eyes moving with her up the wall and bumping around the corner onto the ceiling. she's just looking at who's dragging her, eyes glazing. reverse in her pov to the shadowy, horrendously ugly man, dragging her with fierce glee across the ceiling, literally swabbing the ceiling with her bloody body. seen in forced perspective, the shot carries her across a great distance without seeming to get anywhere as if the ceiling is an endless plane. angle down on rod on his hands and knees the lamp next to him blurting blue sparks and strobing the nightmare room. rod's screaming up at tina's invisible tormentor.}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{what the hell's going on here! tina!}
<A>__{angle on tina upside down, clawing at the hanging swag lamp above her mother's dressing table desperate for some anchor. but she's dragged away from it. the lamp swings back, it's wires gushing more sparks. closer along the ceiling as tina rakes a long furrow in the ceiling with her fingernails. but her eyes are glazing, glazing. and then they fall closed. wide, up on the ceiling, as her body suddenly flops loose, hanging for an awful moment by the feet over the bed. reverse on rod staring like a terrified child.}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{tina }
<A>__{reverse in his pov as the body falls like a sack of rocks onto the devastated bed, in slow motion, striking with a huge splash of blood. a sick, awful giggle floats around the room, then echoes off into infinity. rod staggers up, staring around as if hoping to see this phantom.}

<D>__{you motherfucker ! i will kill you for that!}
