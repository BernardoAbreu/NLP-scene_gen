<D>__{ben, i don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. i need you to be patient for a little while longe }

<C>__{ben}
<D>__{look at me, reed. look at me!}

<D>__{good thing you're flexible enough to watch your own back. 'cause you're on your own now.}
<A>__{ben seems to relax and reed lets go. ben walks out. sue comes to reed's side. he's bleeding.}

<D>__{i'm ok. just go, go after him. stop him.}
