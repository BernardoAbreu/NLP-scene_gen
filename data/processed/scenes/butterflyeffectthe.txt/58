<A>__{evan comes to in an unfamiliar place. still in running mode. his body contorts spastically like a fish on land, since he is now lying face down on the ground. evan regains himself and sits up painfully. his face is badly bruised and he clutches his battered ribs.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{how long was i out?}
<A>__{he gets no answer from lenny, who stands in the exact same spot. tommy is nowhere in sight and the sound is of kayleigh weeping. evan spins to face her.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{kayleigh?! are you okay? where's crockett?}
<A>__{kayleigh, her knees drawn tightly to her chest, is unable to answer through her tears. evan struggles to rise but he becomes dizzy and falls back to the ground. evan takes a quick glance toward the gunny sack, smouldering then moans and buries his head in his hands.}
