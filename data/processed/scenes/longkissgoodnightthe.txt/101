<C>__{charly}
<D>__{back off, man. do i tell you how to snap photos of extramarital blowjobs? no.}
<A>__{there is a short, chirping sound. seemingly from nowhere. they exchange puzzled looks, what the hell...? charly abruptly realizes it's coming from her purse. she reaches in, scoops up the cellular phone, the one she told caitlin to call. thumbs the button. says cautiously:}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{a voice, then... clipped tones, timothy's voice:}
<C>__{timothy }
<D>__{it's me, i got your kid. give your location, we gotta lose the cellular.}
<A>__{charly. hand gripped tight on the phone. pause, then:}

<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{what the hell was that?}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{he's got the kid. doesn't want to talk on the airwaves, he's routing me to a land line. a pay phone.}
<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{which phone? where?}
<A>__{the detective's mind, racing... suddenly it hits him:}
<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{shit. service centers...! they list 'em on the back of phone bills, right?}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{shut up and find me a gun. hk, mp 5.}
<A>__{as he rips open the bill we cut to: a neutral background, as charly's head enters frame, we're very tight on her face... tense, thin lipped. a phone rings, deafening. click charly speaks tersely:}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{verify you have her.}
<C>__{timothy }
<D>__{i got your cellular number off a cast on her right wrist. right below mommy loves you... picture of a panda. dog, panda, it's got funky ears.}
<A>__{close on charly: dead still. made of glass.}
<C>__{timothy }
<D>__{i want money, charly. i know you've got numbered accounts, we all do. i will let you know where and when. fuck with me...? i will blind the kid and shoot out her knees.}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{you're dead, motherfucker. we don't involve families. it's not the way it's done, we don't take families.}
<C>__{timothy}
<D>__{i will be in touch.}
<A>__{he hangs up. dead silence. hold on charly's face... until slowly, ever so slowly, the camera pulls back to reveal: the .45 automatic pointed at the head of an at&t operator. the phone company, they've taken it over. employees cringe on the floor. henessey, mp 5 slung on his shoulder, leveled. charly points to the switchboard:}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{give me an ani trace. do it.}
