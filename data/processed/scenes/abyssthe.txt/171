<L>__{interior quarters mess hall}
<A>__{the lights are down. those who can are grabbing some sleep. snoring comes from one of the bunkrooms as lindsey passes. in the mess hall, catfish and bud are crashed out on the tables, wrapped in blankets. the cold has gotten intense. water drips. the walls sweat with condensation. lindsey can see her breath as she makes coffee. she carries a cup over to monk, who is a face in a pile of blankets. a hand comes out, takes the coffee.}

<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{lindsey sips hers, staring. her thoughts are far away... in the bottomless pit. she is leaning up against the table where bud is sleeping. his soft snoring downshifts into a loud rasp. lindsey touches him gently on the shoulder.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{virgil, turn on your side.}
<A>__{bud grunts and turns without waking, an automatic response. the snoring stops. it is a quiet, intimate moment, a reminder of the mileage these two have logged together.}
