<A>__{we can barely make out the funeral procession passing over the burnt brown of a dry river bed. the figures move slowly, seemingly from out of hundreds of years of the past. the musicians walking unsteadily on the rocky bed, their instruments harsh and blaring. they are followed by six young peasant men, carrying the crude wooden coffin on their shoulders. then the widow, a strong large woman, dressed in black, and not accepting the arms of those walking with her. behind her, not more than twenty relatives, few children and paisani continue alone behind the coffin. suddenly, we hear the shots of the lupara, and the musicians stop their playing. the entire procession scatters in odd directions along the rocky river bed. the young men struggle with the burden of the heavy coffin, throwing it out of balance and nearly crashing to the ground. we hear a woman screaming:}

<D>__{in the hopes of clearing my family name, in the sincere desire to give my children their fair share of the american way of life without a blemish on their name and background i have appeared before this committee and given it all the cooperation in my power. i consider my being called before this committee an act of prejudice to all americans of italian extraction. i consider it a great dishonor to me personally to have to deny that i am a criminal. i wish to have the following noted for the record. that i served my country faithfully and honorably in world war ii and was awarded the distinguished service cross for actions in defense of my country. that i have never been arrested or indicted for any crime whatsoever... that no proof linking me to any criminal conspiracy, whether it is called mafia or cosa nostra or whatever other name you wish to give, has ever been made public. only one man has made charges against me, and that man is known to be a murderer, arsonist and rapist. and yet this committee had used this person to besmirch my name. my personal protest can only be made to the people of this country. i can only thank god that in this country we have a legal system and courts of law to protect innocent people from wild accusation. i thank god for our democratic due process of law that shields me from the false charges made by this committee's witness. i have not taken refuge behind the fifth amendment, though counsel advised me to do so. i challenge this committee to produce any witness or evidence against me, and if they do not, i hope they will have the decency to clear my name with the same publicity with which they have now besmirched it. i ask this without malice, in the interests of fair play.}
