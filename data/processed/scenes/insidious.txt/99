<L>__{interior living room, new house day}
<A>__{elise holds court in the living room. renai and josh hold each other, struggling to comprehend it all.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{i'm not sure if you are ready to hear this yet...but unfortunately i can't waste any time easing you into it. there is no time left.}
<A>__{she takes a deep breath, preparing herself.}
<C>__{elise }
<D>__{i want you to know that this is what i believe and it may contradict a previous medical diagnosis. however, you called me here and i am taking that as an acceptance of my readings.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{go on.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{your son...is not in a coma. his physical body is here, but his spiritual body is not.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the reason these disturbances followed you to a new home is because...it is not the house that is haunted. it is your son.}
<A>__{this is too much for josh. renai, however, wants to listen.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{i don't understand...}
<A>__{elise considers what she is about to say carefully.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{have you ever heard of astral projection?}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{out of body experiences?}
<A>__{elise nods.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{i call them travellers. these are people with the ability to leave their physical body and travel to different places in an astral form. to some degree, we all have the ability to do it...but most of us subconsciously suppress it or don't know how to access it.}
<A>__{josh shakes his head, agitated. renai leans forward, desperate for an answer to her terror.}
<C>__{elise }
<D>__{dalton is...a very accomplished astral projector. he has been since he was very young. he's not afraid of his ability. and that lack of fear has led him to travel too far and become lost...}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{lost? lost where?}
<A>__{elise gazes up at the ceiling, as if looking into another world.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{in the further.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{the further is that place beyond our perception, beyond our understanding of the physical world that we can see and touch. it is a place without clocks or measurements, without past or future...an infinite realm that holds all of our dreams...and all of our nightmares.}
<A>__{she turns to look at them.}
<C>__{elise }
<D>__{that is where dalton is.}
<A>__{renai cries, unprepared for what she is hearing.}
<C>__{elise }
<D>__{the problem is that with his astral body gone, he has left a physical body with us. an empty vessel.}
<A>__{josh can't meet her gaze.}
<C>__{elise }
<D>__{and there are entities that know this. they can smell it the chance to live again. that is why they have gathered around him.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{how many are there?}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{there are five benevolent spirits. five different entities for whom dalton has become a most prized possession. they are trying to get inside his physical body...and they get closer with each passing day.}
<A>__{her words hang in the air like gunsmoke. pure fear courses through josh's eyes. he fidgets, agitated.}
<C>__{elise }
<D>__{then there are two entities who are...not benevolent. one of them takes the form of a man, the other...}
<A>__{she holds up the drawing that specs di.}
<C>__{elise }
<D>__{they work together, so desperate are they to possess dalton. they are the closest of all the entities to getting inside him.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i don't want to scare you, but i have never, in all my years of doing this, experienced anything as terrifying as their presence.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{is there a way to bring dalton back?}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{there is something we could try. a way of calling him back. i would need your complete trust.}
<A>__{josh can't take it any more. he stands up.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{no. no. this has gone too far.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{you said that you'd give her a chance!}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{i have given her a chance, and i did that because i wanted to help you. but i cannot have somebody telling us that the reason our son is in a coma is because his soul is floating off somewhere in another dimension.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{i know this is hard to hear.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{no, it's not fair is what it is. you're preying on people's grief and vulnerability, which is really easy to do in a situation like this.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{why did we go to all the trouble of bringing them here if you're just going to reject what they say?}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{because i wanted to help you. to put your mind at ease, and if this helped, then great. but to drag dalton into this? no.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{josh, you're not being fair...}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{fair? how did the voice of reason become the bad guy here? don't you see? you want to believe. of course you do, honey, anybody would.}
<A>__{the room goes quiet. josh turns to elise.}
<C>__{josh }
<D>__{look, i appreciate what you're trying to do. i really do. but i think it's dangerous to start throwing out false hope like this. i have to put my foot down. my wife is not...mentally well at the moment, and i have to keep at least one of her feet here in the real world.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{you never believed me...}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{honey, i'm on your side. but i genuinely think this is dangerous and frankly, a little exploitative.}
<A>__{he turns to elise, specs and tucker.}
<C>__{josh }
<D>__{you come into a home with a seriously ill child, you make a tenuous connection between him and these experiences renai is having and viola the client starts crying because they're desperate to believe, the tears validate your power, thank you, that'll be six hundred dollars please.}
<C>__{specs}
<D>__{we reject more cases than we take. we're not out for money, sir.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{i know, i know...look, i appreciate your interest and your time. i do. thank you. thank you very much.}
<A>__{he goes to the front door, opening it.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{i completely understand. and i honestly don't blame you for reacting like this.}
<A>__{she walks to the door, followed by specs and tucker, who sling their bags over their shoulders sheepishly.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{no, please...don't go.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{thank you for your time.}
<A>__{they exit. the door closes. they are gone.}
