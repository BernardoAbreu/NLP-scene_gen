<D>__{yeah...a lot.}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{i seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.}

<B>__{miss van deusen}
<A>__{spins around, seeing tamara standing there with eva.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{wow, sorry...}
<B>__{rennie}
<A>__{flounders at the surface, nobody realizing the terror she's experiencing. she's too scared to even cry for help.}
<B>__{miss van deusen}
<A>__{isn't looking at rennie, her attention on admonishing tamara.}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{why on earth would you do something like that?}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{it was an accident, i swear...}

<P>__{(to rennie)}
<D>__{rennie, are you okay?}
<A>__{rennie's point of view she's can't even hear sean, her vision being splashed by the chlorinated water. she sinks under the surface, turning around...and coming face to face with young jason. the eight year old corpse grabs her ankle and}
<B>__{tries to drag her down.}
<A>__{sean's point of view as rennie sinks under the surface, all alone, thrashing in terror.}
<B>__{sean}
<A>__{realizes she's in trouble. he immediately dives in after her, pulling her to the pool's edge, where miss van deusen helps to lift her out.}
<B>__{tamara and eva}
<A>__{quickly move on.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{that was truly excellent.}
<C>__{eva}

<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{time to check out the waiters.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{i think i will pass. see you later, okay?}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{but...wait a minute!}
<A>__{eva walks away. tamara acts angry, but deep down she's hurt.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{some friend you are.}
