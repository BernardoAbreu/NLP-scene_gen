<A>__{it is now sunset on mars and it's literally of inearthly beauty. the sun is bold and blood red; the foggy, drip ping glass of the dome tints the light into strange colors. quail emerges from the hotel, properly attired now in a white tropical suit, and starts for the taxi stand. behind him, also emerging from the hotel, is the shoeshine boy. he keeps out of sight but is definitely tailing quail. as quail nears the first solar powered taxi in line, he is approached by an amiable looking calypso guy wearing a west indian shirt and bright straw hat.}
