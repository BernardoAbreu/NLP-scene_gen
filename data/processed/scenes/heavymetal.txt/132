<B>__{the transformation}
<A>__{we float in darkness for a moment as black shapeless images zoom past.}

<P>__{(v.o.)}
<D>__{i felt like i was nothing just atoms floating in the darkness ...}
<A>__{then, tiny beams of light join to form a glow in the corner of the screen. the glow gets brighter and starts moving slowly around the screen. now, we can make out some of the images whipping past a half formed hand, pages of a book, a crumbling pyramid, a green ball.}

<P>__{(v.o.)}
<D>__{then, a body started to re form around me. only it wasn't my body this one had muscles.}
<A>__{sturdy muscular parts begin to materialize around the moving light. they join up with each other to form a powerfully built human figure. finally a man's face takes shape, and as it forms, eveything gets brighter and clearer.}
<C>__{dan}
<P>__{(v.o.)}
<D>__{it was a great body, but i wasn't too crazy about the face.}
<A>__{the powerful figure, den, turns slowly as he floats and begins to look at his hands and arms. moving his mouth, he speaks in a new voice deep and powerful.}
<C>__{den}
<P>__{(feeling head)}
<D>__{hmmm ... no hair.}
<A>__{suddenly, the background explodes into fields of radiant colours as the body accelerates away from us and passes through a second shimmering gateway.}
