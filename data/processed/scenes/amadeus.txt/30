<L>__{interior buffet room in the palace day 1780's}
<A>__{salieri enters the room and looks about him cautiously. he is salivating with anticipation as he stares at the feast of sweet things. his attention is attracted in particular by a huge pile of dark chocolate balls arranged in the shape of a pineapple. he reaches out a hand to steal one of the balls, but at the same moment he hears giggling coming toward him. he ducks down behind the pastry table. a girl constanze rushes into the room. she runs straight across it and hides herself behind one of the tables. after a beat of total silence, mozart runs into the room, stops, and looks around. he is age twenty six, wearing a fine wig and a brilliant coat with the insignia of the archbishop of salzburg upon it. he is puzzled; constanze has disappeared. baffled, he turns and is about to leave the room, when constanze suddenly squeaks from under the cloth like a tiny mouse. instantly mozart drops to all fours and starts crawling across the floor, meowing and hissing like a naughty cat. watched by an astonished salieri, mozart disappears under the cloth and obviously pounces upon constanze. we hear a high pitched giggle, which is going to characterize mozart throughout the film.}
