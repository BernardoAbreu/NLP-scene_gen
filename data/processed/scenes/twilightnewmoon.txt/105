<L>__{exterior road (continuous) night}
<A>__{bella hurries up the road toward her house. jacob's suddenly standing in front of her, furious }
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{stop. you gotta come with me.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{it's okay. they're my friends }
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{don't you get it? if a cullen is back here, this is their territory. the treaty says we can only defend our own lands.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{ it's not a war }
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{it is. and you'll only be safe in la push. i can't protect you here anymore.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{i don't need you to }
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{ you're about to cross a line }
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{only if you draw one.}
<A>__{she starts to move past him, but he stops her }
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i'm not letting you do this.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{you don't have a choice. i don't belong to you.}
<A>__{her words are a knife to the heart. she sees that, but can't take them back. he hands her the keys.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{bye, bella, i hope you don't die.}
<A>__{she flinches at the stinging remark. he disappears into the darkness, leaving her alone on the dark road. she's closer to her house than her truck. she hurries forward. the night sounds start to encroach, branches crackling, bushes rustling. she glances behind her... nothing but darkness... she faces forward again and runs directly into a vampire! bella screams then realizes it's alice. bella is stunned. so is alice.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{alice!}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{you're... alive.}
<A>__{she's clearly confused, but bella hugs her with tears of joy.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{oh my god, alice. you're here.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{i heard voices i didn't think it was you but you're alive.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{you keep saying that.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{i saw you a vision of you you jumped off a cliff. i knew i'd be too late but }
<P>__{(becoming angry)}
<D>__{why the hell would you try to kill yourself?!}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{i didn't. i was cliff diving.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{why?!}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{um... fun?}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{that was fun for you.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{until i hit the water.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{i have never met anyone more prone to life threatening idiocy... and what is that hideous wet dog smell?}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{oh. probably jacob. he's kind of a werewolf.}
<A>__{off alice's horrified expression.}
