<A>__{papers and books litter the floor. dekker trashes the place, looking for a clue of any kind. he rifles through the bookshelves, cabinets. all to no avail. that's when he finds... a medium sized paperback, dog eared and worn. the title of the book... "chaos" by james gleick. dekker flips through the book. pages are marked, high lighted. key words we find include, "edward lorenz, chaos theory, birth of a new science."}
