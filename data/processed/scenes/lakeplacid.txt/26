<C>__{bickerman}
<P>__{(rattling it off quickly, simply)}
<D>__{well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... i think he had alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one coherent day, he asked me to end his suffering. i wouldn't do it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that i finish him off. finally i just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead.}
<A>__{jack, keough, and kelly just stare back at this crazy woman. off their looks }
<C>__{bickerman }
