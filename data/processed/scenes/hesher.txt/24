<L>__{exterior fair oaks high school afternoon}
<A>__{it's after school. kids are leaving campus. tj wheels his bike across the school yard.}
<L>__{exterior street moments later}
<A>__{tj rides his bike down the street. dustin's yellow mustang appears beside him. dustin is boiling.}
<C>__{dustin}
<D>__{you're fuckin' dead.}
<A>__{we see that someone has drawn in big black marker a crude picture of a body, sitting on a toilet with a big erect penis. the picture is drawn on the side of dustin's mustang door, so his real head lines up with the drawing. it's drawn in perspective so it looks like dustin's head is attached to the naked defecating body to outsiders. the words 'suck my cock' have been scrawled beside the picture. dustin swerves the car toward tj, narrowly missing him. tj cuts into a large super market parking lot, attempting to get away. dustin accelerates ahead of tj and screeches to a halt in front of him, cutting him off, almost hitting him. tj stumbles and falls off his bike. his bike lands on top of him. dustin jumps out of his car and starts beating tj in the middle of parking lot traffic. tj struggles just to protect himself, cowering on the ground and covering his head. dustin tries to wrestle tj free of the bike so as to get a clearer shot at him. he drags tj by his t shirt, ripping it off in the process. and then a woman's voice }
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{dustin ignores the voice. he continues beating tj.}
<D>__{voice (o.s.) (cont'd) hey! leave him alone!}
<A>__{dustin ignores again.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{hey! i said stop it!}
<A>__{dustin ignores one last time a beat passes, then the woman, nicole (mid 20s), appears behind dustin and jumps onto his back, bear hugging his face.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{leave him alone!}
<A>__{dustin shakes erratically, nicole has a tight grip on him, but eventually dustin manages to throw her onto the ground.}
<C>__{dustin}
<D>__{what the fuck are you doing lady?}
<A>__{nicole picks herself up off the ground and holds up her fists like she's ready to fight. she doesn't look very tough.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{what are you doing?!}
<A>__{nicole stands defiantly between dustin and tj. dustin looks around at the scene he's created in the street. a man steps out of his car. dustin realizes it's time to go.}
<C>__{dustin}
<P>__{(to tj)}
<D>__{i'm not finished, you fuck.}
<A>__{he gets back into his car, slams the door and speeds off. nicole watches him go, then helps tj up. tj is shirtless, scrawny, dirty and traumatized.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{are you alright?}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{am i bleeding?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{i don't think so. am i?}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{tj grabs his t shirt and pulls it back on. he picks his bike up off the ground and hops on. he goes to peddle, but the chain is busted. his peddling goes nowhere.}
