<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior parking structure, top floor angry men 3 a.m.}
<A>__{in a concrete space. we've entered mid scene.}
<C>__{fujima}
<D>__{we're not certain...}
<C>__{castillo}
<D>__{you said nazi low riders...?}
<C>__{fujima}
<D>__{we're not certain!}
<C>__{tubbs}
<D>__{c'mon, man!}
<C>__{fujima}
<D>__{we think nlr. we don't know! alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet. he wasn't deep into the crew.}
<C>__{crockett}
<D>__{white gangs...? it doesn't track.}
<C>__{tubbs}
<D>__{white gangs is tweakers and a crystal meth lab in a trailer park. bounce around the old lady saturday night and get your recidivist ass busted back...}
<C>__{fujima}
<D>__{not anymore. this is a distribution network out of south florida, moving poly drug loads, crystal meth through coke, to nashville, atlanta, memphis, cleveland. and computer fraud, identity theft. it's like that.}
<C>__{castillo}
<P>__{(to the point)}
<D>__{tell them what you want.}
<C>__{fujima}
<D>__{they knew about alonzo, before he made a move on them. they had our operation. they've cut into us.}
<C>__{crockett}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{fujima}
<D>__{we don't know.}
<C>__{tubbs}
<D>__{break your encryption? hack your e mail? employee databases? somebody on the inside?}
<C>__{fujima}
<D>__{we don't know. and that's the pointerior maybe there's a mole. whatever, it's a disaster. and it's a joint interagency task force. i have dea, atf, u.s. customs components in on it. so the penetration could be from any one agency. what we do know is i have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause i have to assume our operational security is blown.}
<C>__{tubbs}
<D>__{as in, your ass is dead in the water.}
<C>__{fujima}
<D>__{but miami pd wasn't part of the j.i.t. and from what alonzo said, he didn't give you up.}
<C>__{crockett}
<D>__{so what do you want?}
<C>__{fujima}
<D>__{to recruit you.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{castillo}
<D>__{...i didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement. we don't know who's straight up, who's not...}
<C>__{crockett}
<D>__{recruit us to do what?}
<C>__{fujima}
<D>__{get into business with this crew, identify them. illuminate their network. if you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us. we'll indict and take it from there...}
<C>__{crockett}
<D>__{how do we do that? make a buy?}
<P>__{(wry)}
<D>__{that went well...}
<C>__{tubbs}
<D>__{reverse undercover? we supply to them?}
<C>__{fujima}
<D>__{they got a steady stream of supply. so, no...}
<C>__{crockett}
<D>__{from whom...?}
<C>__{fujima}
<D>__{a colombian producer. named archangel de jesus montoya londono.}
<C>__{crockett}
<D>__{never heard of him.}
<C>__{fujima}
<D>__{from the north valle area. new. low level, we think.}
<C>__{tubbs}
<D>__{aryan brothers are not going to change up suppliers. so...}
<C>__{crockett}
<D>__{transpo? how they bringing the loads in...?}
<C>__{fujima}
<D>__{they're not. they collect in miami. montoya, the producer, handles deliveries. that's his end, and he varies the routes. we got some flir off an awac of a coupla go fast boats, on one run, that's all.}
<A>__{fujima boots up his military spec laptop to view the flir video. meanwhile...}
<C>__{tubbs}
<D>__{track with me, here...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{they knew the "russians" were undercover feeb? they should have no showed. but, no, these guys show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers. and steal all your money...}
<P>__{(beat; to fujima)}
<D>__{what does that say to you?}
<C>__{crockett}
<P>__{(speculating)}
<D>__{it says, "we do not fear you."}
<P>__{(to fujima)}
<D>__{it says, "fuck off and die." it says, "we get down for recreation..."}
<A>__{fujima's dell laptop glows to life. two almost indistinguishable boats and their wakes are seen.}
<C>__{crockett }
<D>__{blow that up...}
<A>__{crockett's attention goes to something atypical he spots about the wake emerging behind each boat. he exchanges a look with tubbs. but they say nothing.}
<C>__{tubbs}
<P>__{(to crockett)}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{crockett}
<D>__{we could try to run loads into these guys.}
<P>__{(to fujima)}
<D>__{run a few loads for montoya into south florida. into this group.}
<C>__{fujima}
<D>__{you need to consider a few issues.}
<C>__{castillo}
<P>__{(to crockett + tubbs)}
<D>__{...you'd be operating outside territorial united states. your badges do not count. you have no authorization to carry weapons. if you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re patriated. and there's no backup...}
<P>__{(to fujima)}
<D>__{and you will share with them all your intel on montoya...}
<C>__{fujima}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{castillo}
<D>__{i mean full disclosure.}
<C>__{fujima}
<D>__{of course. from my side, i don't want to know anything about what you're doing or how you do it...}
<P>__{(to castillo)}
<D>__{so let me know if we're on...}
<A>__{fujima splits. castillo waits until fujima's car pulls away.}
<C>__{castillo}
<P>__{(to tubbs)}
<D>__{about the stevens family, i'm sorry. i know you were close to them.}
<C>__{tubbs}
<D>__{i was the kids' godfather.}
<C>__{castillo}
<P>__{(intuits)}
<D>__{and...?}
<C>__{tubbs}
<D>__{"and" what?}
<C>__{castillo}
<D>__{i got to know. there is never any room for "personal"...}
<C>__{crockett}
<P>__{(for tubbs)}
<D>__{he is fine. and we know the jokes. when it gets vengeful, things get messy. when they get messy the wrong people die...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{everybody gets it.}
<C>__{castillo}
<D>__{good.}
<C>__{tubbs}
<D>__{and the answer is "yes."}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{before she met alonzo, once upon a time, a long time ago.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you bet it was personal.}
<A>__{...and is now compartmentalized in the past.}
<C>__{castillo}
<D>__{okay.}
<P>__{(to crockett)}
<D>__{what'd you spot...?}
<C>__{crockett}
<D>__{three wakes off the back of those boats. who runs three sterling engines off a deep v hull?}
<C>__{tubbs}
<D>__{sal maguda.}
<C>__{castillo}
<D>__{he any good?}
<C>__{tubbs}
<D>__{oh, yeah...}
<C>__{castillo}
<D>__{so what's gonna persuade montoya to change off sal maguda running his deliveries...?}
<A>__{it's a rhetorical question.}
