<A>__{neptune and his court sit smoking havana cigars as each member of the crew present themselves. robin dressed like a pig and crawls around snorting. john's an indian brave, whooping and hollering as he does a rain dance. chuck, with flippers on his hands and feet, hops around like a frog. rick is in 'drag' as neptune's girlfriend and must sing everything he says. charlie is dressed like a sloth and slithers along the deck. frenetic chaos.}
