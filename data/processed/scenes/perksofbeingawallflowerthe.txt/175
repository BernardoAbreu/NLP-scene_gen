<L>__{interior sam's bedroom night}
<A>__{the pictures are down. the dressers empty. the suitcase is open on the bed. charlie watches sam fold clothes and put them in her suitcase. he has promised himself he will not cry. even when she packs away his beatles 45 of "something." instead, he looks at her and tries to remember every detail. her hair and brown eyes and sound of her voice.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{thanks for staying up with me.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{sure. my brother said penn state has a restaurant called ye olde college diner. you have to get a grilled stickie on your first night. it's a tradition.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{that sounds like fun.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yeah. pretty soon, you'll have a whole new group of friends, and you won't even think about this place anymore.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yes, i will.}
<A>__{sam moves some suitcases over to the pile in the room. they stand next to each other. close.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{i had lunch with craig today.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{he said he was sorry, and that i was right to break up with him. but i'm driving away, and i just felt so small. just asking myself why do i and everyone i love pick people who treat us like we're nothing?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{we accept the love we think we deserve.}
<A>__{he says it sober. without judgement. sam lets it sink in. charlie walks over to the bed to do more packing. then, she turns to him.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{then, why didn't you ever ask me out?}
<A>__{charlie didn't expect that. he is silent. heart pounding.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i, uh, i just didn't think you wanted that.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{well, what did you want?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i just want you to be happy.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{don't you get it, charlie? i can't feel that. it's really sweet and everything, but you can't just sit there and put everybody's lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love. i don't want to be somebody's crush. i want people to like the real me.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i know who you are, sam.}
<A>__{sam waits. and charlie finally speaks from the heart.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{i know i'm quiet, and i know i should speak more, but if you knew the things that were in my head most of the time, you'd know what it really meant. how much we are alike. and how we've been through the same things. and you're not small. you're beautiful.}
<A>__{he can't contain himself anymore. he moves to her and kisses her. they stand. move to the bed. kissing. charlie's heart pounds. they sit on the bed. still kissing. we see her fingertips. her hand on charlie's knee. when she touches him, charlie pulls away from her. shocked. like he's seen a ghost. it hits charlie like freezing water.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what's wrong, charlie?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{oh, ah... nothing.}
<A>__{charlie shakes off whatever was bothering him and continues}
