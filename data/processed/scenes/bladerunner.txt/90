<L>__{interior tyrell den night}
<A>__{tyrell comes in and sits behind his desk. sebastian hands down the invoices. tyrell glances over them and writes out a check. he looks up to hand it over when he sees batty against the wall, by the door. for a fraction of a second he's shocked, but recovers fast.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{a friend of yours, sebastian?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{yes, this is someone who wants to talk to you, dr. tyrell.}
<A>__{batty smiles.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{the name is batty. roy batty.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{oh?}
<A>__{very slowly tyrell's hand moves towards the back side of the desk.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{to act without understanding could lead to the very thing the act seeks to avoid.}
<A>__{what's in batty's eyes completes the warning. tyrell decides to heed it.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{a little talk it all i need.}
<A>__{tyrell looks at sebastian. considers consequences. back to batty.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{would you like to talk in private then.}
<A>__{batty thinks it over.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{yeah. it might be better if we talk in private, sebastian. why don't you go home.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{here's your check, my boy. thank you.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{thank you, dr. tyrell. i will see you later.}
<A>__{he slips out closing the door behind him. opens it again and sticks his head it.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{was everything okay?}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{just beautiful.}
<A>__{he's gone. if tyrell is scared he's doing a good job of concealing it.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{i'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{it's not an easy thing to meet your maker.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{and what can he do for you?}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{can the maker repair what he makes?}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{would you like to be modified?}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{had in mind something a little more radical.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{what's the problem?}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{death.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{i'm afraid that's a little out of my...}
<A>__{batty cuts in with a whisper.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{i want more life, fucker.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{come here.}
<A>__{batty walks forward.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{sit down.}
<A>__{batty does.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{the facts of life. i will be blunt. to make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal. a coding sequence can't be revised once it's established.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies like rats leaving a sinking ship. the ship sinks.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{what about e.m.s. recombination?}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{we've already tried it ethyl methane sulfonate is an alkylating agent and a potent mutagen it creates a virus so lethal the subject was destroyed before we left the table.}
<A>__{batty nods grimly.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed dna strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic you are made as good as we could make you.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{but not to last.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{put it this way. rolls royces are made to last as least they were. but i'm afraid you're a ferrari. a high strung racing car built to win, not to last.}
<A>__{batty smiles bitterly.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{also you're too valuable to experiment with.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{i am?}
<A>__{tyrell can't help a flash of pride.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{the bast of all possible androids. we're proud of our prodigal son glad you're returned. you're quite a prize.}
<A>__{shoulders hunched, batty looks down, an uncharacteristic note of guilt in his voice.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{i've done some questionable things.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{also extraordinary things.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.}
<A>__{they share a laugh. in spite of himself, there's a look of relief in tyrell's face as batty extends his hand. tyrell takes it and they shake. the reverence in bat ty's eyes caused tyrell a fatherly smile. the smile turns into a growl as he feels the bones in his hands crack. before the scream comes out of his mouth, batty stifles it. tyrell claws at the iron fingers, but they're sinking into his face. placing his other hand behind tyrell's head, batty squeezes them together and squashes the man's head like a melon. the mess is not small. palms up, like a surgeon, batty walks to the drapes and wipes off the gore and without looking back, strolls out of the room.}
