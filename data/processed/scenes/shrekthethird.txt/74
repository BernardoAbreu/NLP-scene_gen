<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior merlin's camp later}
<A>__{a fire blazes. merlin throws a handful of dirt into the fire, it flares.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{now all of you, look into the "fire of truth" and tell me what you see! yah! ha!}
<P>__{(wild war cry)}
<D>__{woo looo looo looo!}
<A>__{he points at the smoke and it starts to form objects (i.e. rorschach inkblots). puss and donkey, excited, sit by the fire.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{ooo! charades! okay, i see a dutch fudge torte with cinnamon swirls.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{okay. monster, go for it.}
<A>__{shrek glances at the fire. the stroller from his nightmare begins to take shape in the smoke. he blows the image away. he covers his fear and changes the subject.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{i see a rainbow pony. shrek the third final screening script 66.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{excellent work!}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{now! the boy!}
<C>__{artie}
<D>__{this is lame.}
<A>__{merlin whacks artie on the back of the head.}
<C>__{artie}
<D>__{ow!}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{you're lame! now just go for it.}
<A>__{he tosses more dirt and flames burst up. artie studies it.}
<C>__{artie}
<D>__{okay. there's a baby bird and a father bird sitting in a nest.}
<A>__{merlin starts beating a drum. artie's expression starts to change as he stays focused.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{yes! stay with it! stay with it!}
<C>__{artie}
<D>__{wait, the dad just flew away. why did he leave the little bird all alone?}
<A>__{shrek starts to take this in as he watches. artie gets more worked up.}
<C>__{artie}
<D>__{it's trying to fly, but it doesn't know how to. it.. it's gonna fall!}
<A>__{suddenly, artie catches what he said. as the smoke drifts away, he looks and sees everyone else staring back at him, stunned.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{whew, proper head case you are, aren't you? really messed up. whoa.}
<A>__{merlin goes back inside. they all stare at artie.}
<D>__{shrek the third final screening script 67.}
<C>__{artie}
<D>__{yeah, yeah, okay. i get it. the bird's me. my dad left. so what?}
<A>__{donkey gives shrek a nudge to go over and talk to artie. shrek hesitates and donkey insists.}
<C>__{shrek}
<P>__{(clears throat)}
<D>__{look artie...um }
<A>__{just as he's about to get going, "that's what friends are for" starts playing loudly from merlin's security device drowning out any conversation. they all turn toward the shack where merlin peeks out.}
<C>__{merlin}
<P>__{(loud, over the music)}
<D>__{just thought i might help set the mood! y'know for your big heart to heart chat!}
<A>__{everyone stares at him. he sheepishly turns off the device and shuts the door. it's quiet again.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{i know what it's like to not feel ready for something.}
<A>__{artie looks at him.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{even ogres get scared...you know, once in a while.}
<C>__{artie}
<D>__{i know you want me to be king, but i can't. i'm not cut out for it and i never will be, alright?}
<A>__{shrek takes this in.}
<C>__{artie }
<D>__{even my own dad knew i wasn't worth the trouble. he dumped me at that school the first chance he got and i never heard from him again. shrek the third final screening script 68.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{my dad wasn't really the fatherly type either.}
<C>__{artie}
<D>__{well, i doubt he was worse than mine.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{oh yeah? my father was an ogre. he tried to eat me.}
<A>__{artie looks at shrek.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{now, i guess i should have seen it coming. he used to give me a bath in barbecue sauce and put me to bed with an apple in my mouth.}
<A>__{artie chuckles at this.}
<C>__{artie}
<D>__{okay... i guess that's... pretty bad.}
<A>__{artie laughs and then pokes at the fire.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{you know, it may be hard to believe what with my obvious charm and good looks, but people used to think that i was a monster. and for a long time, i believed them.}
<A>__{artie looks up at shrek.}
<C>__{shrek }
<D>__{but after awhile, you learn to ignore the names that people call you and you just trust who you are.}
<A>__{artie gently pokes at the embers with a stick for a moment.}
<C>__{artie}
<D>__{you know, you're okay, shrek.}
<A>__{he tosses the stick into the fire.}
<C>__{artie}
<D>__{you just need to do a little less yelling and use a little more soap. shrek the third final screening script 69.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{thanks artie.}
<C>__{artie}
<D>__{the soap's because you stink. really bad.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{yeah. i got that.}
<A>__{the camera slowly booms up and away from the group as the fire continues to burn.}
