<L>__{interior office, construction site continuous}
<A>__{bond and davidov step into a fully functioning office. everything elektra requires is here. computer, phones, drinks cabinet. she is in the middle of a group of workmen and secretaries, looking at plans, talking, pouring herself a cup of coffee.}
<C>__{elektra}
<P>__{(to foreman)}
<D>__{...they should have been in place two days ago. that is the target my father set.}
<C>__{foreman}
<D>__{we've had some trouble with the villagers at ruan. some sacred burial plot...}
<C>__{davidov}
<D>__{miss king...james bond here to see you.}
<A>__{she looks up...a brief moment of recognition...then back to business.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{find me the research on the limestone deposits, go ahead and place these orders, and get the jeep ready. i will go to ruan myself...}
<C>__{davidov}
<D>__{miss king, i wouldn't recommend...}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{i said, i will go.}
<A>__{she signs some documents and the men file out. she gets up, turning her back to bond, hands on her hips.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{would you excuse us, davidov?}
<A>__{davidov nods and leaves. elektra still keeps her back turned, but he can see her physically change, her shoulders sag, her arms cross in front of her. when she finds her voice, it has a gravelly sound of emotion.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{i met you at my father's funeral.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{i haven't been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{funerals aren't exactly memorable.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{god no. all those horrible loved ones and relatives. i don't want to talk to those people. i just want to...talk to my father.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i loved him. i'm not sure he knew that.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{is that why you want to finish the pipeline?}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{partially, yes.}
<A>__{her muscleman body guard appears, says briefly:}
<C>__{gabor}
<D>__{the jeep is ready, ma'am. will i be driving with you?}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{no, gabor. we have a guest.}
<A>__{gabor glares at bond before he leaves.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{who is he?}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{my bodyguard. he follows me everywhere. he's decisive, vigilant. and he makes an excellent omelette.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{how long has he been with you?}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{since the kidnapping. why do you ask?}
<A>__{bond takes something out of his pocket, he opens his palm, shows it to her.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{does this look familiar to you?}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{it's my father's pin. he wore it everyday of his life.}
<A>__{she swallows back emotion. looks in his eyes, with a sad half smile that unsettles him.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{are you trying to break my heart? or is it just your way with women?}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{it's not the pin your father wore. it's an exact duplicate. inside is a tiny electrical detonator. we have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{if you've come here to look after me, mr. bond, thank you, but no thank you. i have two bodyguards, i don't need a third...}
<A>__{she starts to walk out. he follows her...}
