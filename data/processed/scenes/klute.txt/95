<L>__{interior arlyn's apartment day}
<A>__{the retching sounds are coming from the connecting room. no one visible here. a very few barren pieces of furniture. we hear arlyn's voice ask from the next room }
<C>__{arlyn }
<D>__{cappy?}
<A>__{arlyn enters rather eagerly. she sees klute first, then bree recognizes her retires flat against a wall, holding one palm outwards to shield her face. she is unbelievably gaunt. inside one elbow, looking rather like a birthmark, we see a lacework of purple where her veins have pulped together.}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{arlyn? honey?}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{look, it's all right.}
<A>__{from the connecting room a man's voice (berger's) calling out hoarsely.}
<C>__{berger }
<D>__{is it cappy? cappy? }
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{arlyn, it's all right.}
<A>__{berger hastens, stumbles, into the doorframe carrying a car radio with wires dangling, speaks before he sees them.}
<C>__{berger}
<D>__{cappy, i got a radio!}
<A>__{he stops for an instant face to face with klute. then turns, plunges out of view again. arlyn breaks after.}
<C>__{arlyn}
<D>__{no }
<A>__{we hear the mumble and whisper of their voices from the connecting room (as she reassures him). bree looks inquiringly at klute (is that grunemann?): he shakes his head. pause, then arlyn reenters, wrapping her fingers together timidly wanting them out her only purpose.}
<C>__{arlyn }
<D>__{bree honey please, we're waiting for someone.}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions something you could help us about.}
<C>__{arlyn}
<D>__{can't you see i'm strung out?}
<P>__{(cries out)}
<D>__{please, we're waiting for it he's got to have it!}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{we'll go. just something you could tell us, first.}
<A>__{arlyn seems to accept the bargain. he indicates to bree to proceed, stands away a little. arlyn covers her elbow with one hand. bree manages as best she can.}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{honey, a couple of years ago, with jane and frankie? jane sent me a dumper }
<C>__{arlyn}
<D>__{please, if he sees you, he won't come!}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{arlyn, just tell me, did jane have a dumper, one of her regular johns?}
<C>__{arlyn}
<D>__{what about him? yes.}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{did he come around often?}
<A>__{klute hands grunemann's picture to bree: bree shows it to arlyn. arlyn inspects it, then uncertainly, weakly }
<C>__{arlyn}
<D>__{no. he was an older man hon. the dumper was older.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{do you remember his name? what can you tell me about him?}
<A>__{we hear footsteps under, dimly mounting the stairs. bree notices them first, klute persisting with arlyn }
<C>__{berger }
<P>__{(shouts desperately)}
<D>__{arlyn, get them out.}
<C>__{arlyn}
<D>__{please, i am begging you.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{it's important.}
<C>__{arlyn}
<D>__{that's not the dumper, that's all! he was an older man!}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{can you give me any more description than that?}
<A>__{arlyn catches the footsteps, dodges past him toward the door, intending to reassure }
<C>__{arlyn}
<D>__{cappy? }
<A>__{ as the pusher, cappy, steps in. all of this is very quick, simultaneous, a confusion of voices. cappy takes one look at klute }
<C>__{arlyn }
<D>__{it's all right, they're all right }
<A>__{ turns and runs.}
<C>__{berger }
<D>__{cappy? cappy?}
<A>__{cappy's footsteps race away down the stairs. berger plunges out from the connecting room, still carrying the car radio, shouting, pursuing }
<C>__{berger }
<D>__{cappy it's all right! i got a radio don't run, don't }
<A>__{we hear him stumble and fall on the stairs outside, the sound of body reeling down. arlyn shrieks and races after: klute and bree follow.}
