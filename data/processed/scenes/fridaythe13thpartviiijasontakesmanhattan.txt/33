<A>__{as mcculloch impatiently checks his watch and list again. miss van deusen walks up to him.}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{hello, charles. has everyone checked in?}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{jim miller and suzy donaldson never showed up. i'm a little concerned.}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{don't be. they probably decided to explore each other rather than new york.}
<A>__{he gives her a disdainful look, starting up the ramp.}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{let's go we're running two minutes late.}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{charles, there's someone else coming along too.}
<A>__{he stops, following her glance. his face tightens.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{rennie is walking toward them with a small suitcase, her dog toby striding next to her. she walks up to him, starts to say something, then decides against it. rennie heads up the gangway. hold on mcculloch and miss van deusen. he's livid.}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{you have no right...}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{and neither do you. it's up to rennie to decide what she wants to do.}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{she doesn't know what she wants. she's never had a stable life.}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{and she sure doesn't have one now, either. she needs to live.}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{i'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and i alone know what's best for her. end of discussion.}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{no, i think it's just the beginning.}
<A>__{she walks past him.}
