<A>__{julian stands on the street corner sipping a soft drink. waiting. behind him gordon, his phone glued to his face. on the other side of the road is choi yan lee's kiosk, big enough to double as his home, currently manned by his long suffering wife kim yan lee. she serves a chilled coconut to a man. as he turns round we reveal... he's a particularly murderous looking member of julian's crew ko sam. we pick out charlie ling a little further down the road, who's looking at a tray of battery powered robots that some street kid's selling. they're all counting down the minutes. biding their time. waiting for choi yan lee to turn up. finally the sound of the tuck tuck approaching... ko sam drinks his coconut down in one slurping as he hits the bottom. letting the empty shell fall to the floor. charlie ling stands up. feels the gun under his jacket. the tuck tuck pulls up and choi yan lee's daughters help him into the kiosk that doubles as their home. julian and his men close in.}
