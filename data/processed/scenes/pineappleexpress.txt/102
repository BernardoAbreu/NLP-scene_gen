<L>__{interior barn continuous}
<A>__{the barn starts to buckle, when dale suddenly leaps out of the trap door, flames licking his heels. coughing profusely, dale stands in the barn, then realizes his pants are on fire.}

<A>__{dale wriggles out of his pants and kicks them away.}
<C>__{dale }
<D>__{ow. ah. ow. okay... cough cough}
<A>__{he starts to walk out of the barn when he suddenly trips over someone.}
<C>__{dale }
<D>__{saul!}
<A>__{he grabs one of the unconscious saul's feet and starts to drag him out of the barn. just a they exit, the barn collapses in on itself, crumbling into a massive heap of burning wood. dale pulls saul onto the grass. saul starts coughing.}

<C>__{dale}
<D>__{what's cool is that you came back for me man. you did, right? you weren't just captured again, were you?}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{hell no! i was scott free. but how the hell was i going to leave you there after you came to save me? fuck that.}
<A>__{they take a few deep breathes and each cough a bunch. suddenly, they see something moving in the rubble. red emerges, lightly crisped with his clothes on fire. he roles around in the dirt trying to put himself out.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{motherfuckers. motherfuckers. light me on fire? kill my fiesta? fuckers.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{red? you okay?}

<C>__{red}
<D>__{fuck yeah, i'm fine. i'm red. you're makin' me feel like a broken record. now can we get the fuck out of this shit hole.}
<A>__{they all stand up. red puts his arms around dale and saul for support. they start to hobble towards the forest.}
<C>__{saul}

<C>__{dale}
<D>__{i've gotta get downtown, try and win angie back.}

<C>__{dale}
<D>__{do you think we should have looked for the ear? they probably could've re attached it, eh? i mean, this ear thing kind of fucking sucks.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{oh my god, they blew your ear off, man! fuck that's gross. can you dudes switch sides? i don't want to look at it.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{don't worry, man. look at evander holyfield, he looks totally normal. and plus, i saw this thing on the discovery channel, they can actually grow ears, like, in a petri dish, or even on the side of a mouse. and you only need half of one. it'll be a fuckin' cinch.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{i just realized i've 100% lost my job by now. i haven't called in for days.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{who fuckin' cares? i thought you wanted to be a talk radio dude anyways? and, like, i never said anything, but you do have the voice. like, when i didn't know what you did, i kind of thought you might have been doing cartoon voices, you know, like that shrek shit, and that's why you wore a suit.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{you do have a good talk radio voice. i love that shit, too. i...wait, say something again?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{what? why?}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{you're that dude whose always calling kstar about havin' two garbage days. i totally agree with you, man. i work out of my house, and it's, like, one of my main concerns, garbage pile up.}

<D>__{saul, what're you going to do?}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{work at a bong shop.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{i'm still selling weed. fuck you guys.}
<A>__{they walk together in silence, delighted at their new prospects. after a brief moment, saul suddenly seems afraid. he starts nervously looking back towards the barn.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{do you hear something?}
<A>__{dale motions at his wounded ear.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{all i hear is ringing.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{dude, i'm kind of freakin' out. like...i don't know...like, there might be someone out there. i mean...how do we know we got them all?}
<C>__{red}

<A>__{dale starts getting nervous, but tries to hide it.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{well...the barn did collapse in a ball of fire, and we probably each inhaled about ten pounds of weed smoke, so...it's just, you know }
<A>__{dale suddenly looks over his shoulder, but sees nothing.}
<C>__{dale }
<D>__{...a little paranoia.}
