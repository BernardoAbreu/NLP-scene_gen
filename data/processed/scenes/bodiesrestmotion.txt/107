<B>__{angle to include sid and beth}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{that's about the saddest thing there is... losing someone you love.}
<A>__{beth is struck by a certainty that she's never lost anyone she's loved because she's never really loved anyone.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{it's never happened to me.}
<A>__{sid hesitates, then speaks his heart.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{if you died, i couldn't stand life.}

<C>__{beth}
<D>__{no! that's... that's a fuckin' animal thing, i've done that.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{not with me.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i meet men, go home with them and just stay. no decision involved it's just what i do. and then i don't have to live my life, i just lead theirs. i can't keep doing that.}

<C>__{sid}
<D>__{that's true.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{beth can't bear the risk of opening her soul to believe him and she can't bear to hear the outpouring of his soul without believing him. so she ends it.}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(after a beat, harshly)}
<D>__{you won't know when i die. you won't be there.}
<A>__{she picks up her suitcases and heads for the door.}
