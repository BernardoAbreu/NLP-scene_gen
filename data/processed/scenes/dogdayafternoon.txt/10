<L>__{interior bank day}
<A>__{sonny, re entering the bank, speaks to howard.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{lock it.}
<A>__{sonny now crosses to desk that jackie indicated, as everyone watches him, as though it's all in the game.}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(taps loudly on top of desk)}
<D>__{hey... get outta there! nobody's gonna hurt you.}
<A>__{jenny, a young, frightened girl, peeks out from under the desk, obviously afraid to reveal herself. sonny starts to move toward the front of the bank. sal turns so he can cover everyone. sonny turns to order howard.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{pull the drapes.}
<A>__{howard doesn't move.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{pulla drapes!}
<A>__{howard belatedly leaps to work, pulling drapes that screen off the interior from outside. the door has no drapes or blinds and thus when the drapes are closed there is a corridor of space across the street we will always be able to see. and from which people outside will always be able to see in. as howard finishes the task, he then walks back to the huddled group on the rear.}
<B>__{sonny}
<A>__{on his way to the back of the bank, is digging into his jacket pocket; he swings around as he passes the camera that is bolted to a wall bracket covering the tellers' area. he whips out a spray can and gives the lens a shot of red painterior there are three cameras in all, each of which he sprays.}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{no replay, folks... no alarms...}
<A>__{after spraying the three cameras, he has reached mulvaney's desk area. the girls are scattering to group farther back and sonny and mulvaney are heading for the vault.}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<P>__{(on cross to vault with sonny)}
<D>__{we're hip... let's just get you all fixed up and on your way!}
<A>__{miriam, a young, awkward, overweight jewish girl, chewing gum with nervous machine like rapidity, moving toward the vault. the gate is closed, and she holds one key and mulvaney the other. they pass sal, who now holds the others in the bank under his gun while at the vault gate.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{okay, is the vault open?}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{i can take care of that.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{mulvaney is about to insert his key in his lock. sonny quickly reaches out and grabs mulvaney's hand, and looks at the key he has extended. he explodes.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{son of a bitch!}
<A>__{he almost hits mulvaney with his fist.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{what the fuck you tryin' to do? trip the alarm? use the spur key? use the other one...}
<A>__{he's grabbed the keys from mulvaney and holds up the key mulvaney was going to use... we're in a: very tight two shot mulvaney and sonny's heads sonny holds the key right in the middle of the frame where mulvaney and the audience can see the key has a tiny projection or spur at the end. if this key is used, the spur triggers a silent alarm.}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{i must of been outta my mind.}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(furious)}
<D>__{well, you get your mind right. i'm a catholic and i don't wanna hurt nobody, but goddamn it, don't you play no games with me. unnastand?!?}
<A>__{mulvaney nods and picks out a key that is identical except for the spur. he shows it to sonny. sonny nods.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{as mulvaney carefully uses the safe key to unlock the gate. miriam is crying as she unlocks her side. the gate swings open. sonny shoves mulvaney inside and, as he passes miriam, notices her tears. she just stands there staring into his face like a hypnotized chicken, the tears streaming down her face. sonny stops, staring at her. mulvaney, starting to open the gate, moves inside the vault, impatient...}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{okay. let's get you on your way. miriam open the safe.}
<A>__{miriam hesitates.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{what's the matter with you?}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<P>__{(to miriam)}
<D>__{come on, lemme load you up...}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{there isn't any money...}
<A>__{sonny looks at mulvaney, alarmed...}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{they picked it up this afternoon...}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{no money?!}
<P>__{(moves inside the vault)}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{there's only about four thousand in singles, and maybe a few hundred in larger bills... he's going to kill us!}
<A>__{sonny storms into the vault.}
<B>__{new angle in vault}
<A>__{as mulvaney pulls a cash drawer out to show sonny: even we can see there isn't much there. sonny searches for more, finds nothing.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{this is it? what am i gonna do with this? holy shit!}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{it's all we got.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{okay, don't worry about it. stick it in the bag...}
<A>__{at this, sonny pulls out a plastic bag from his pocket, hands it to miriam, who opens it and puts the money into it. as he turns, we see that miriam is still staring at him, terrified, and as his rifle swings around, she reels back with a little screech of terror...}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{ah, jesus...}
<C>__{sal}
<D>__{let's go, sonny.}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(suddenly gentle)}
<D>__{what are you crying for? jesus christ. it's not your fault there's no money...}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{she's afraid you're gonna shoot...}
<P>__{(hands sonny the bag of money)}
<A>__{sonny starts out of the vault toward the teller's area with bag of money. he speaks to mulvaney.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{what the hell would i shoot her for?}
<A>__{miriam follows sonny to teller's cages gate. he carries the bag. phone starts to ring (#1)}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{answer the phone!}
<A>__{mulvaney crosses to his desk, picks up the receiver. sal follows him, yanks receiver from one ear to the other, so he can hear conversation.}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(to miriam)}
<D>__{okay... open this.}
<A>__{miriam crosses to gate, presses the necessary button and the gate opens from them. sonny watches this carefully, noting where the buzzer button is. he crosses in front of the drawer at the first cage. he tries to open the drawer. it's obviously locked.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{okay, who's the head teller here?}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{i am.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{open this up!}
<A>__{sylvia comes forward and unlocks the first drawer, and begins to remove the cash, but sonny grabs her hands... alarmed...}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{don't take it all out!}
<A>__{he grabs a piece of paper or cardboard... close shot sonny's hands and cash in drawer he takes all the singles but one out of the singles slot in the drawer, leaving the bottom single in place. it is held there by a metal clip. he carefully slips the paper under the clip and then removes the single. it is clear this is an automatic alarm meanwhile...}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{boy, i can't trust a one of you... i worked in a bank, i know the alarms, so don't try to fool around with me!}
<B>__{back to shot of sonny and sylvia and miriam}
<A>__{as they move to 2nd cash drawer at 2nd teller's cage. sylvia unlocks the drawer and starts to reach in for the cash, but sonny pushes his hand into the drawer instead. he begins to stuff the money into the bag. some fives, packaged with rubber bands, in the drawer, he holds up so sal and all can see them... he laughs!}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{decoy money, right, it's marked! shit!}
<A>__{he throws it into the air so the bills flutter all around him, gaily... in the background, mulvaney, having finished with the phone conversation, is moving to the rear with the rest of the girls. sonny now moves to the 3rd cage's cash drawer... mulvaney ends phone conversation and sal moves him over to group at vault.}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(mimicking sylvia)}
<D>__{'this window is shut...'}
<A>__{again, the same procedure begins. sylvia unlocks the cash drawer and sonny starts to scoop it out and put it into the opened plastic bag that miriam holds.}
<C>__{sal}
<D>__{cheer up, you'll be the veteran of a robbery, the bank sends you a dozen red roses, you know that?}
<A>__{at this point, the phone begins to ring again (#2)}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(yelling to sal)}
<D>__{sal, let him answer the goddamn phones, they're driving me crazy! look at this chicken shit!}
<A>__{again, mulvaney starts to cross back to his desk, again followed by sal. sonny yells out to mulvaney as he crosses to answer the phone.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{hey, you, manager... don't get any ideas, fucker... see that man there? i bark and he bites!}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{believe me, i'm on your side.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{my side, shit!}
<A>__{they move to drawer #4.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{listen, we got young girls here... you could watch your language.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{i speak what i feel.}
<B>__{mulvaney on the phone}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{hello... i'm sorry i can't talk to you right now... i suggest you call during banking hours tomorrow. what is your name?}
<A>__{back on sonny, sylvia and miriam}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{gimme the traveler's checks and the register.}
<A>__{they cross toward the last drawer area (#5). miriam is still crying silently. sonny holds out the plastic bag for the checks for her. she drops it.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{please... quit that. it's not necessary.}
<A>__{with everything in the bag, sonny now takes the register and starts to move the two girls toward the rear near the vault.}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{can you hurry it up?}
<B>__{back to sonny}
<A>__{as he moves toward the rear (sylvia and miriam now re joining other women), to get a wastebasket. accomplishing this, he starts to burn the pages of the register, tearing out pages as he does so. it's smokey as hell, but not burning well. he drops it, smoking, into the wastebasket.}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(to howard)}
<D>__{hey, you! give me the keys... we're gettin' outta here.}
<C>__{howard}
<P>__{(gasping for breath)}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{howard?}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{on howard}
<D>__{the old man is panicked, great patches of sweat spreading around his armpits. he breathes in asthmatic gasps; now he flinches at his name, as though he's been hit.}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<P>__{(stands, receiver}
<D>__{still to ear, then covering it with his}
<P>__{hand)}
<D>__{howard, give him the keys...}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{gimme the keys to get outta here!}
<A>__{howard is unable to move. seeing his predicament, edna moves to him and starts to unfasten his belt to remove the keys. mulvaney continues with his phone conversation.}
<B>__{on sonny}
<A>__{who now crosses to howard and edna, losing patience with the situation. as he moves closer, howard backs away from him, frightened by his rifle. seeing that, sonny puts it down and looks over to sal for coverage.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{sal...}
<A>__{as sonny approaches howard, he realizes that he can't get close enough.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{take it easy... just gimme the keys. i'm not gonna hurt you. listen, calm down, huh? you're gonna have a heart attack. just gimme the keys... that's all i want.}
<A>__{howard gives him the keys and as sonny starts to walk back toward the burning register...}
<B>__{on sal}
<A>__{with mulvaney still on the phone.}
<C>__{sal}
<P>__{(looking past camera,}
<D>__{falling onto the}
<P>__{floor behind mulvaney)}
<D>__{sonny... who's that? across the street.}
<B>__{on sonny}
<A>__{who now starts to move quickly toward the front of the bank, being sure to hide behind the posts as he moves.}
<C>__{mulvaney }
<P>__{(on phone)}
<D>__{no, it was the credit rating. the credit rating. i don't know, you'd have to find that out from him.}
<A>__{sonny has now reached the front of the bank. he carefully peeks out through the closed draperies to look outside. angle on street sonny's pov a man, in a business suit, sweaty and harassed looking, is walking from an insurance office across the street directly toward the bank... the man continues coming straight toward them and us...}
<B>__{reverse}
<A>__{sonny starts to run back to get his gun from margaret's desk. mulvaney is still on the phone.}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{it was something a couple of years ago in st. louis, i don't know...}
<A>__{sonny grabs the gun from the desk top and moves over to mulvaney.}
<B>__{angle on door at front of bank}
<A>__{the man walks straight toward the glass door, already lifting his hand to shadow his eyes, so when he reaches the door, he'll be able to see inside.}
<B>__{reverse on sal and mulvaney}
<A>__{sal brings the gun up so he can shoot the man, at the same time, crabbing himself aside so he is concealed behind mulvaney and the desk. mulvaney sees the approaching man and cups his hand over the phone.}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{it's the insurance guy across the street. he probably saw the goddamn smoke!}
<P>__{(motions toward smoking register)}
<D>__{please! put out the fire!}
<B>__{on man}
<A>__{the last few feet from the door.}
<B>__{on sonny}
<A>__{who rushes through the teller's cages gate toward the register, grabs the smoking register, throws it onto the floor near edna's desk, and starts to stamp it out.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{i will get some water!}
<A>__{before anyone can move, sonny grabs the gun on them all.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{nobody move! freeze!}
<A>__{the women now begin to scream as real hysteria sets in. deborah screams, collapses. close on sal}
