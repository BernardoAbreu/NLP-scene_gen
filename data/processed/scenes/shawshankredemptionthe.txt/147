<L>__{ext highway construction site day (1963)}
<A>__{a road gang is grading a culvert with picks. there's dust and the smell of sweat in the air. guards patrol with sniper rifles, a pushy woman reporter in an ugly hat bustles up the grade, trailed by a photographer.}
<C>__{woman reporter}
<D>__{you there! you men! we're gonna take your picture now!}
<C>__{heywood}
<D>__{give us a break, lady.}
<C>__{woman reporter}
<D>__{don't you know who i am? i'm from life magazine! i was told i'd get some co operation out here! you want me to report you to your warden? is that what you want?}
<C>__{heywood}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{no, ma'am.}
<C>__{woman reporter}
<D>__{that's more like it! now i want you all in a row with big bright smiles on your faces! grab hold of your tools and show 'em to me!}
<A>__{she turns, motioning her photographer up the grade. heywood glances around at the other men.}
<C>__{heywood}
<D>__{you heard the lady.}
<A>__{heywood unzips his pants, reaches inside. the others do likewise. the woman turns back and is greeted by the sight of a dozen men displaying their penises and smiling brightly. her legs go wobbly and she sits heavily down on the dirt grade.}
<C>__{heywood}
<D>__{c'mon! we're showin' our tools and grinnin' like fools! take the damn picture!}
