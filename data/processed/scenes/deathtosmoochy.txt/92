<A>__{it's the middle of a smoochy taping. smoochy and the gang are wrapping up a song entitled, "my stepdad's not mean (he's just adjusting.)" the kids in the bleachers are singing the chorus.}
<C>__{kids}
<D>__{'stepdads are people too they have bad days, like we all do be patient and help them through stepdads are people too...'}
<A>__{smoochy continues the song.}
<C>__{smoochy}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{... 'so three cheers for the man that i proudly call stan... he's not quite a dad or a brother... yes, he gets cross, but still he's the boss... and besides he takes care of my mother!'}
<A>__{the song ends. the kids in the bleachers applaud. smoochy addresses them.}
<C>__{smoochy}
<D>__{remember, kids. first impressions, good or bad, are not always what they seem. just like a new puppy, new dads need to adjust to their surroundings. so give 'em time! but always remember... if he becomes abusive to you or mommy... what are the magic numbers?}
<C>__{kids in bleachers}
<P>__{(shouting in unison)}
<D>__{nine one one!}
<C>__{smoochy}
<D>__{right o riffic!}
<A>__{the smoochyland band plays a little fanfare.}
<C>__{smoochy}
<D>__{and now, boys and girls, i have a special surprise. i'd like to introduce the newest member of the magic jungle... my cousin... moochy the rhino!}
<A>__{the smoochyland band plays a happy little song as spinner dunn, in costume as moochy, runs on stage. the moochy costume is identical to smoochy only it's a darker orange instead of bright orange.}
<C>__{smoochy}
<D>__{howdy, moochy! welcome to the jungle! you wanna say howdy to the kids?}
<A>__{spinner freezes. he stares at the camera.}
<C>__{smoochy}
<D>__{moochy?}
<C>__{spinner}
<D>__{my name is moochy.}
<C>__{smoochy}
<D>__{that's right. we've established that.}
<C>__{spinner}
<P>__{(leaning into sheldon)}
<D>__{sheldon, this costume's makin' my nuts itch.}
<A>__{sheldon looks horrified. the smoochyland band quickly launches into some music. smoochy, moochy and a few other jungle animals begin to dance. moochy's lumbering movements are in stark contrast to the choreographed steps of the others. as a bonus, he occasionally scratches his crotch.}
