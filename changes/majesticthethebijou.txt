The Paramount, the Million Dollar.  From a time when moviegoing was a complete experience, not a trip to the local mall.

We MOVE AMONG THEM, until we pick up A COUPLE, and we stay behind them as they work their way through the crowd, on their way to THE THEATER ENTRANCE, where an ornately attired DOORMAN smiles and tears their tickets.}
