<L>__{interior coffee room day}
<A>__{arnith and bill, two city workers, sit sipping coffee at a cafeteria table. the room is white, very clean and fairly new. the men wear large orange overalls, their white construction safety helmets sit on the table beside them.}
<C>__{arnith}
<D>__{trouble is the city keeps cutting us back and cutting us back.}
<A>__{raymond and paul, wearing his big red parka, enter.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{excuse me, are you arnith?}
<A>__{arnith sips his coffee, points to his name patch but doesn't look up.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{great. i was told to give you this.}
<A>__{paul hands arnith a folded form. arnith puts his hand out, forcing paul to move the form to him. as arnith looks at it.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{disinterment order. got it from the coroner's office. my brother didn't want to be buried.}
<C>__{arnith}
<D>__{how'd you know?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{know what?}
<C>__{arnith}
<D>__{that he didn't want to be buried.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{he left it in a letter.}
<C>__{arnith}
<D>__{and you just got it now?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{ya know, i don't mean to be rude here, but i'm not sure this is any of your business.}
<C>__{arnith}
<D>__{that's entirely possible.}
<A>__{bill stifles a laugh. raymond is about to tear out arnith's spine. paul holds his brother back.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i, i don't think this is anything to be flippant about.}
<C>__{arnith}
<D>__{i appreciate that, sir. but i'm on a union specified break right now, which means you are talking to me as a private citizen. now as a private citizen i can pretty much say whatever i want to. if you talk to me in 15 minutes i can assure you, you will be afforded every courtesy as specified in the workers policy guide and recently ratified in our latest collective agreement dated }
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{sorry. i'm just }
<C>__{arnith}
<D>__{trying to get your brother out of the ground. we couldn't be more pleased. you've arranged for transportation of the remains?}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{we're gonna take him to go.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{see, now that's a problem. we can't release the body into your custody unless you are licensed by the state to convey deceased persons.}
<C>__{arnith}
<D>__{good point bill. bill knows exhumation policy. you can look it up but i'm betting he's right. you come back with a bonded agent and we'll get right on this.}
<A>__{paul thinks for a moment, digs into his pocket pulls out five crisp, new hundred dollar bills and slams them on the table.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i will give you five hundred dollars to go get him now.}
