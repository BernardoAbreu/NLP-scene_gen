<L>__{interior diner night}
<A>__{kayleigh finishes a plateful of food at a busy diner. she lights up an after dinner smoke.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{you're right, evan, i don't believe you.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i never thought you would. that's why i've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why i never will again.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{i'm the only person you've told? that's a great line. does that make other girls swoon? do they actually eat up this bullshit?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly i'm too tired to prove it to you.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{oh? there's proof now?}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(tired)}
<D>__{shit. i dunno. how would i know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{then forget that. how about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step sister.}
<A>__{kayleigh's jaw drops.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{oh! and when you orgasm, your toes go numb. i'm sure your clientele aren't privy to that one.}
<A>__{kayleigh tries to conceal the surprise in her eyes.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i just thought you should know.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{know what?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{that i didn't leave you there to rot.}
<A>__{kayleigh flinches as if her should had been invaded, then her eyes fill with distrust and contempt.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{there's one major hole in your story.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{which is?}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{there is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that i was in some fuckin' sorority.}
<A>__{she opens evan's wallet and leaves a twenty on the table.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{sure you don't want your wallet?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{don't think i will need it where i'm going.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{off to change everyone's life again, is that it? maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while i wind up in tijuana doing the donkey act.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i'm over it. whenever i try to help anyone it all turns to shit.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{well, don't give up now, slick. you've already done so much for me. hell, why don't you go back in time and save mrs. halpern and her baby. then maybe lenny wouldn't freak out and ruin my family.}
<A>__{she gets up and puts on her coat.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{oh, here's one! go back when i'm seven and fuck me in front of daddy's handicam, you know, straighten me out a bit...}
<A>__{she tosses his wallet over her shoulder at him and leaves.}
