<L>__{exterior park day}
<A>__{john cusack and roxanne eat wrapped sandwiches while walking through metro city park.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{how's your sandwich? "john cusack" it's quite delicious.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{hope you don't think i'm too forward. some men are intimidated when a woman asks them out. i just find you really easy to talk to. "john cusack" and i you.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{you know, you're not at all like you are in the movies. "john cusack" i'm not?}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{yeah. i don't know you have this strange, refined way of speaking. "john cusack" i do? that is most interesting.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{anyway, when we were talking the other day i just felt, even though we only talked for a couple of hours, that we've known each other for years. "john cusack" i know just what you mean.}
<A>__{roxanne bites into her sandwich.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{you know what? this sandwich is disgusting.}
<A>__{she tosses it in a nearby garbage can.}
<C>__{roxanne }
<D>__{of course i already ate half of it. i wonder what that says about my character? "john cusack" it means you don't give up on a sandwich. you see that it has potential, and you give it every chance to be all it can be.}
<A>__{roxanne smiles at his analogy.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{thanks, but knowing me, i was probably projecting my expectations of what a lunch should be on the sandwich. it might have been okay at first, but i just made it bitter.}
<A>__{john cusack notices roxanne's smile starting to fade.}
<D>__{"john cusack" is that what happened with your last sandwich i mean, boyfriend?}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{when i look back, i probably shouldn't of expected so much from him. he was already a giving person. you know, one of those go out and save the world types. "john cusack" i've run into a few.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{i was selfish, i guess. i didn't want to share him with anybody else. "john cusack" it sounds like he was a special man.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{they broke the mold.}
<A>__{john cusack arches his eyebrow in a very familiar manner.}
<D>__{"john cusack" perhaps not.}
