<A>__{as haven walks outside towards his waiting horse. he pauses, pipe in mouth, lighting the pipe now, his face intensely interested as he watches the men form on the parade ground in front of the mounted iles and stellman. full shot of soldiers. as they mount to a brisk command, and the color bearer takes position. iles barks out a command; the column forms into marching order. on the double quick, the cavalry company starts out and on the way. close shot of haven as he watches; his eyes lighting a little, the pipe in hand. we feel that he'd like to go too in this moment. another angle from haven's view, as the column of cavalry departs. haven waves his hand, a half salute, a half gesture to iles as iles salutes him in passing. then only the dust remains and haven's gaze lingers. his face changes. it becomes grim. he slowly knocks the ashes from the pipe, pockets it. he slowly mounts the horse. he takes out his gun and checks it. then slowly he rides away, like a man on a mission he dislikes but cannot evade.}
