<A>__{jack, wrists still bound, stands in the classic 'walking the plank' pose. elizabeth is next in line. pirates crowd the ship's rail to watch.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it's pure evil to make a captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime. no good can come of it.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{now, jack. that reef is less than a league distant. it's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{someone needs to cut these bonds, then.}
<A>__{barbossa smiles, shows a pistol. points it at jack.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{you'd best take a swim, jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{the last time you did this, you left me a pistol, with one shot.}
<A>__{the pirates mutter agreement.}
<C>__{pintel}
<D>__{that's proper, sir, according to the code.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{by the powers, you're right!}
<P>__{( turns around)}
<D>__{where's jack's pistol? who's got it? bring it forward!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{a gentleman might give us two pistols, seeing as there are two of us, this time.}
<A>__{a pirate hands jack's pistol to barbossa.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{tell you what. i will give you one pistol, and let you be the gentleman, an' shoot the lady, and starve to death yourself!}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{that is, presuming you're not both drownded.}
<A>__{the pirates laugh. barbossa tosses jack the pistol but over his head, and down into the water with a splash.}
<C>__{barbossa }
<D>__{so how did you get off that island, anyway?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you can go to your grave not knowing.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{that's fair.}
<A>__{jack glares at barbossa. then he's prodded with a cutlass, takes a step out. reaches the end of the plank steps off. jack plunges down into the water. appears on the surface, floundering, struggles to stay afloat. will and elizabeth exchange helpless looks; there is nothing they can do.}
<C>__{barbossa }
<D>__{the lady's nexterior but first, i will be wanting that dress back, if you please.}
<A>__{elizabeth hesitates ... then strips it off, leaving her in a silk slip. she throws it at him.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{here it will go well with your black heart !}
<A>__{barbossa indicates the plank.}
<C>__{elizabeth }
<D>__{i will not walk into the ocean. you'll have to throw me in!}
<A>__{barbossa raises an eyebrow, grins, nods.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{have at her, lads!}
<A>__{the pirates rush to comply. lift her up, toss her over the rail with a scream she falls }
