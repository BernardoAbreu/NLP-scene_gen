<L>__{interior apartment building}
<A>__{white, awkwardly trying to hide his cuffed hands in his coat, follows the japanese woman up a flight of dark stairs. she keeps looking back at him, smiling but says nothing.}
<L>__{interior apartment}
<A>__{white and the woman step into a run down apartment. she points to a couch. white looks uncomfortable. she smiles again, then turns on the radio. music. she steps into an adjoining bedroom, leaving white alone. he gets up and starts to tune the radio. a babble of fragments of voices and music, then: a news report...}
<C>__{news reader o.s.}
<D>__{...earlier this evening it was reported a man fitting his description had been apprehended.}
<A>__{white listens nervously.}
<C>__{news reader o.s.}
<D>__{...and now for a message from lump o food products...}
<A>__{across the room he can see the woman's bedroom door ajar. he crosses to the doorway and looks in. the woman stands naked against a deep red wall, her back turned. she has an elaborate tattoo on her back looks like an insect. she puts on a dressing gown and turns suddenly. white steps back before she notices him, he goes back to the couch. she steps from the doorway holding a bar of soap in her hand. she sits down beside white and takes his hands, gently lathering soap around the handcuffs, continuing to smile at him. white looks down. his hands seem to have shrunk they poke out of his sleeves like tiny children's limbs. the cuffs effortlessly slip off. white looks at the woman, then back at his hands nothing strange, they are normal size, but somehow the cuffs have been removed. he looks at the woman again, grateful. he can't help smiling.}
<B>__{his p.o.v.}
<A>__{her eyes. her lips. her neck. she leans forward, goes out of}
<B>__{focus. another angle}
<A>__{she touches her tongue to his lips. kisses his face. she pushes him back on the couch and pulls her dressing gown open. white does not respond seems uncertain. she sits upright, astride his body, unbuckles his belt, opens his shirt, caresses his chest. she stops, her face in shadow. slowly, white lifts his hands to her breasts, touches them. she starts to breath deeply. out of focus their bodies entangle, begin to move rhythmically. the camera tracks sideways, reveals a microphone behind a chair, leads us to a mirror on a wall. on the other side of the one way glass a reel to reel tape recorder is picking up the sounds of heavy breathing.}
<B>__{outside}
<A>__{the building the lovers are in slowly rises into the air, past taller buildings and floats out over the city. its shadow moves past empty plazas and across faces of grey towers.}
<B>__{inside}
<A>__{white sleeps, as buildings move past outside the window. he opens his eyes, forces himself awake. looks across the dark room. the japanese woman stands naked at the window, clutching a large red megaphone. in perfect english she shouts down at the streets drifting past.}
<C>__{japanese woman}
<D>__{he's up here! he raped me! hurry! before he kills again!}
<B>__{outside}
<A>__{mystery men stand on roof tops, watching the building drift past.}
<B>__{back in the room}
<A>__{white runs to the window, grabs the woman. as they struggle, the building is landing softly in another part of the city. long shadows move towards the entrance... white wakes up again finds he is still on the couch. no sign of the woman. then he notices her standing by the window (minus megaphone). the wind pulls at her black hair. a distant siren o.s. he gets up, walks over, stands beside her, looks out at the dark city. she ignores him, goes back to the couch, turns on a table lamp, puts her hands before the lit bulb, casts animal shadows on the wall. white watches her. he walks across and sits next to her. she points to herself.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{sachiko.}
<A>__{he nods slowly, looks at her. she waits for him to respond with his name. he shrugs, remains silent. then he puts his hands in the light, makes his own animal shadow.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{that's me. i'm a shadow.}
<A>__{she smiles at the shadows.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{do i look like a murderer to you?}
<A>__{she just keeps smiling, not understanding. kisses him. he notices an old phone on a corner table, removes the note again and rings the same number. this time, after several rings the call is answered.}
<C>__{woman's voice o.s.}
<D>__{yes?... who is this?... who's there?...}
<A>__{white remains silent. sachiko stands and leaves the room.}
<C>__{woman's voice o.s.}
<D>__{john ? is that you?}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{who is this? what do you know about me?}
<A>__{in the darkness of a doorway sachiko hesitates momentarily. she slides a hand into white's coat, removes the wallet. she takes out some cash, puts the wallet back, then she moves off.}
