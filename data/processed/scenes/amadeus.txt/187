<A>__{this is exactly the same shop which mozart and constanze visited with leopold. now salieri's servant stands in it, waiting. we see a few other customers being served by the staff: renting masks, costumes, etc. one of the staff emerges from the back of the shop carrying a large box, which he hands to salieri's servant. the servant leaves the shop. through the window we see him hurrying away through the snowy street full of passers by, carriages, etc.}
