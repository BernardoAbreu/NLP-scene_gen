<A>__{rick sits at the picnic table reading a book. the boys are off playing. kris falls. he grabs his knee and cries. rick drops his book and runs to the child. guards on duty pay no attention. rick reaches the child. the injury appears rather serious.}
<C>__{rick}
<P>__{(calling out.)}
<D>__{can i get some help here.}
<A>__{his calls go unanswered. a tear forms in his eyes. months of frustration boil in his face. a convict passing by kneels by rick.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{can you help me?}
<C>__{convict}
<D>__{can you help him?}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{convict}
<D>__{what does he need?}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{convict}
<D>__{he needs a father, not a book reading baby sitter.}
<C>__{rick}
<P>__{(in a hushed rage)}
<D>__{i can't fucking do this.}
<C>__{convict}
<D>__{yes you can.}
<A>__{the convict runs his hand over the child's leg and everything appears healed.}
<C>__{convict}
<D>__{use your mind and your heart. it's different than it ever should have been... but different isn't wrong.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{but i...}
<C>__{convict}
<D>__{use what you have. there is a vein of wealth inside you just waiting to be mined. think differently than you have ever thought before. worker harder than you ever thought you could. love these children like they've never been loved before.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{convict}
<D>__{the answer lies within. quit worrying about how these misguided events have torn your life apart. quit dwelling on all of your misgivings. look around you. you're not alone. but you, and you alone, will make the difference.}
