<L>__{interior blue bay auditorium day}
<A>__{a hundred high school kids sit before a raised, hardwood stage. the students are not unlike the campus, radiant, well tended a veritable sea of adolescent sexuality bronze boys who seem to have just come from the boats or tennis courts girls in tight shorts riding high up shapely thighs, as... sam lombardo strolls out onto the stage. the man is thirtyish, drop dead handsome. dressed not that differently from the kids, in an izod polo shirt, khakis and boat shoes. his entrance has an effect upon the audience, particularly upon the girls. karen and janelle, 16, pretty blondes, whisper then giggle. nicole, a dark eyed beauty, 17 but going on 25, watches sam's walk, then turns to the girl at her side... kelly van ryan, 17, a fully developed knockout.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{when we graduate the only thing i'm going to miss is...}
<P>__{(with a nod to the stage)}
<D>__{know what i mean?}
<A>__{kelly's eyes are locked on sam. nicole has to nudge her.}
<C>__{nicole }
<D>__{kelly?}
<C>__{kelly}
<P>__{(still staring)}
<D>__{oh yeah.}
<A>__{sam is at the podium. he looks out across the audience. there are a couple of flirtatious whistles, laughter. sam smiles, silencing them with a wave of his hand.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{we've come to the halfway point in my senior seminars...}
<A>__{cheers, applause. sam waits for the kids to settle.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{come on. beats study hall, doesn't it?}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{boos as we find... jimmy leach, 18, grumge look, long hair. he sits with a clique of white trashy types, or at least what passes for such at blue bay school. jimmy appears a bit more genuine, as does... suzle toller, a boyish brunette, seated nearby, but with just enough space between her and everyone else to mark her as a loner. she studies sam lombardo with a dark, sullen stare.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{thank you, jimmy.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{hey, man, at least in study hail i could meditate.}
<C>__{kirk }
<D>__{he means masturbate...}
<A>__{this remark is greeted by a chorus of laughter as we find... kirk, one of the golden boys, seated with kelly and nicole.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{something kirk with which i'm sure you have hands on experience.}
<A>__{loud laughter. sam quiets them again, then turns to the blackboard, where he begins to write, in big letters s e x. the kids start to cheer. sam writes another word c r i m e s. the cheering fades into silence.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{we've all heard the words, date rape, sexual harassment. we've talked about some of these things in this room.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{our speakers today head up the blue bay police sex crimes unit detectives ray duquette and gloria perez.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{they're here to give you what we hope will be a fresh perspective on these subjects, and to answer any questions you night have.}
<A>__{sam turns to the wings, his hand out to welcome the visitors... ray duquette, mid thirties, with the lanky build of a light heavyweight, walks out onto the stage. he's dressed in a dark suit, dark hair combed straight back above steel rimmed glasses. gloria perez walks at his side. she's a good six inches shorter than ray, with a sweet face. attractive but no stunner. about five kids applaud. ray takes the podium.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{thank you for having us. we'll each talk for ten or fifteen minutes, then open it up to your questions...}
<B>__{in the audience}
<A>__{suzie toller suddenly gets to her feet. as she passes behind jimmy, we hear her voice, beneath her breath.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{i'm not going to listen to this jack off.}
<A>__{she marches down the aisle and bangs out the rear door.. ray pauses, a dark look on his face, then goes on...}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{let's begin with a question. what is a sex crime?}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{not getting any.}
<A>__{this draws a few laughs from the kids, a couple of thin smiles from sam and gloria. and none at all from ray duquette.}
