<A>__{as it crashes open, revealing burt klane and his two large brothers, bob and morris. morris has his elbow in a sling and a bandage on his head, courtesy of julius. they spread out... and then freeze at the sound of running water from the kitchen tap.}
<L>__{interior vince's kitchen day}
<A>__{as the klanes burst inside and see webster turn off the tap and begin drying his hands. he's friendly, solicitous, definitely non threatening.}

<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{webster}
<D>__{it's not really important, is it? i wanted to feed the cat before i left.}

<A>__{bob steps forward. before he can do anything, webster pulls out his gun and shoots him in the foot. then webster turns and shoots burt in the foot. the two brothers crumble to the floor, screaming in agony.}
<C>__{webster}
<P>__{(to morris)}
<D>__{your brothers seem to have a problem with their feet.}
