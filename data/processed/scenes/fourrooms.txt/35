<A>__{room 716 close up of a cigarette hanging out of a man's mouth as he speaks into the telephone.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{bottle of moet et chandon. fast.}
<A>__{man hangs up the phone and stubs out his cigarette into an already overstuffed ashtray by the bed. man turns around to face the camera. he is a dark and handsome latin male in his mid 30s. dangerous. impatient. he walks toward the camera as he continues straightening his tie. he stops at the door of the bathroom and watches his wife and two kids get ready for the party. wife seems to be a beautiful woman in her mid 30s. the children are sarah, nine, and juancho, six. man strikes up another cigarette and finishes his tie. he watches his wife comb juancho's hair down and to the side like an idiot. not being able to stand it anymore, man tears juancho away from his wife and snatches the comb.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{give me that...}
<A>__{man begins to slick juancho's hair back.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{there... see? you look cool with your hair up like this. like me...}
<A>__{juancho is smiling now. he's happy he's going to look like his dad.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{not down and to the side, all stupid like your mom likes to comb it.}
<A>__{juancho looks over at sarah, who is going through the tortuous ritual of having her mother brush the tangles out of her long, unmanageable hair. wife seems to be taking out her aggressions on the tangled mess. man is starting to have problems of his own with juancho's hair. juancho's hair is thinner than man's, so it won't stay up. man puts down his cigarette in order to get a better handle on it. we see the frustration growing in his face. juancho picks up the cigarette and pretends he's smoking too, just like his dad. man tears the cigarette away from juancho and smokes it down to the filter. he looks at his own cool hair, and then down at juancho's, which won't stay up. man flicks the cigarette butt into the toilet in frustration.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{you've got your mother's hair.}
<A>__{in anger, man starts messing up juancho's hair.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{i can't do anything with it.}
<A>__{furious, man simply swipes juancho's hair back down and to the side, the way wife had it before. juancho looks like an idiot again.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{there. go.}
<A>__{juancho slouches past everyone as he exits the bathroom. sarah watches him leave as her own hair is finished.}
<C>__{wife}
<P>__{(putting a plastic clip in sarah's hair)}
<D>__{there. go.}
<A>__{sarah exits. wife then finishes her own gorgeous hair. man lights up a new cigarette.}
<C>__{wife}
<P>__{(mocking)}
<D>__{so, are we gonna have fun tonight?}
<A>__{man blows smoke in wife's face as he walks out of the bathroom.}
<C>__{wife}
<D>__{i didn't think so.}
<A>__{sarah has joined juancho in watching television. man watches the children watch tv. we can see the wheels turning in man's head. he turns back to the bathroom. he watches wife now. wheels turning. practically burning rubber.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{wife puts the lipstick down and turns to her husband. she is beautiful.}
<C>__{man}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{let's just leave the kids here.}
<A>__{wife glances out at the children, eyes glued to the tube.}
<C>__{wife}
<D>__{here in the room? by themselves?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{no... with the television.}
<A>__{wife thinks about it for a second. she shrugs a "sure."}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{you want to have fun tonight, don't you?}
<C>__{wife}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{they'll be fine.}
<A>__{he kisses wife's face and exits the bathroom. she covers the wet spot with more cake makeup.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{the children turn to face him.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{you guys are going to stay here and watch tv.}
<A>__{the children look at each other.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{i want you to be in bed asleep before twelve. your mother and i will be back later on.}
<A>__{wife goes straight for the door.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{okay?}
<A>__{he blows one kiss. one for both of them. as man and his wife walk out the door, man turns back to the children...}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{don't misbehave.}
<A>__{he closes the door. sarah stands in the middle of the room. she's looking at the door man and wife just disappeared through. stunned. her dress looks frilly and beautifully uncomfortable. she touches the edges of the fabric.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{why did we have to get all dressed up if we weren't going with them?}
