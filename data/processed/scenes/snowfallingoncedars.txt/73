<L>__{exterior the islander night}
<A>__{kabuo kneeling at the battery well of his boat. he is sliding a new battery into place. beside its older companion. he bolts it down. starts his engine. he is visibly tense. as he steps onto the deck, he sees... ...two figures at the pilings. sheriff moran makes a cutting motion across his throat, as abel moves to grasp the mooring line.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{cut your engine, we're coming aboard.}
<A>__{kabuo doesn't move. the tension has fled beneath the surface. his face now a mask.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{what for, sheriff?}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{we have a warrant. to search your boat.}
<A>__{he holds it up. abel looks uneasy, as if expecting anything.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{well, what are you looking f...}
<C>__{moran }
<D>__{a murder weapon. we think you might be responsible for the death of carl heine.}
<A>__{kabuo blinks. as if hearing a foreign language. words that do not compute.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{sheriff, if somebody killed carl, it sure as hell wasn't me.}
<A>__{moran steps from the dock onto the boat, abel awkwardly following.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{then let's get this over with, so you can get to fishin'. now, cut yor engine.}
<A>__{and walks ahead into the cabin, shining his flashlight across everything. kabuo follows, killing the engine. and in the sudden silence, moran's beam finds... ...the still open battery well.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{you always run with the well open?}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{i was checking the cables.}
<A>__{moran's light moves over the batteries.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{d 6s, huh?}
<A>__{and says no more. runs his beam once more around the cabin.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{we'll come back, let's take a look at the stern.}
<A>__{off he goes. kabuo's glance goes to the open well. then follows, noticing abel martinson prowling around the bow. but in the stern, moran is shining his light. third cleat. port side.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{see you replaced a mooring line, lately. this one's new.}
<C>__{kabuo}

<C>__{moran}
<D>__{look, no way i'm lettin' you out there. in a half hour you could be in canada.}
