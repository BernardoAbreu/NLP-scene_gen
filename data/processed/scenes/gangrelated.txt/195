<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{the key inserted into the door lock night rodriguez pushes open the door to his apartment, enters. shuts the door. stands alone in the room for a moment, then suddenly erupts in rage. ripping off his coat, ripping off his shirt, ripping off the tape recorder taped to his chest. he throws the recorder on the ground. stomps on it until it's shattered into pieces. he stares at the broken recorder.}
<C>__{man's voice }
<D>__{i guess we caught you at a bad time.}
<A>__{rodriguez spins around. vic steps into the moonlight streaming in through the window. behind him is cutless supreme.}

<D>__{but we all have problems.}
<A>__{rodriguez suddenly yells and charges them. he tackles vic. but in the darkness we can't see anything. until the explosion of a gun and the flash of flames lights up the room. a moment of silence then }
<C>__{vic}
<D>__{oh shit. you shot him, you fuckin' shot him!}
<A>__{two men stumble to the door. leaving one on the floor. the door is flung open and vic runs out. followed by cutless supreme.}
