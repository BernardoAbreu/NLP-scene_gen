<L>__{interior catfish's hideout day}
<A>__{catfish's eyes blink awake pinpoint dilated. widen to reveal he's stripped to his boxers, tied to the lazy boy. and jesse is seated beside him.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{i'm gonna ask questions...}
<A>__{jesse rolls a tattoo tray of various hardware towards him: needles. rusted pliers. an electric tattoo drill.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{when i'm satisfied with your answers, i'm gonna kill you. how long it takes and how much blood you want to spill...that's up to you.}
<A>__{catfish grins. a wide, amphetamine smile.}
<C>__{catfish}
<D>__{what do you want to know? want to hear about your brother? how we had him shot up with strychnine? how he died slow death?}
<A>__{without warning, jesse grabs the pliers. a flash of movement, and there's a terrible scream as catfish's front tooth is ripped out. he bucks violently in his chair. jesse jams the drill into catfish's gums, high speed. blood sprays. loud, electric pain and catfish cries out in terror. jesse sets down the drill, deadpan.}
<C>__{catfish}
<D>__{oh, you sonofabitch!!!}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{four days ago, my wife and son were killed.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i hear you took the contract?}
<A>__{catfish smiles. lips quivering with hate.}
<C>__{catfish}
<D>__{forty four pounds, miznay schardin. like you taught me. fuck yeah, i took it. blew your bitch and kid sky high.}
<A>__{jesse grabs the pliers, yanks another tooth. catfish howls.}
<C>__{catfish}
<D>__{motherfucker!!!}
<A>__{blood spews as the drill digs in. catfish screams. jesse tosses teeth on the tray.}
<C>__{catfish}
<P>__{(thrashing wildly)}
<D>__{oh, you're gonna die! you're gonna fuckin' die!}
<A>__{jesse grabs catfish's rapidly swelling jaw and yanks hard.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{where's lucian?}
<A>__{jesse tightens his grip. vice like. blood fills catfish's mouth. he gurgles, then spits in jesse's face... ...flashes of steel and two more teeth rip out at the root. catfish screams then passes out. jesse slaps him awake.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{where's he hidin' out?}
<A>__{catfish, last ounce of spite, cracks a blackened grin:}
<C>__{catfish}
<D>__{get fucked.}
<A>__{the drill strikes. bone deep. gum line splays open. teeth crack and split. catfish screams uncontrollably. blacks out. jesse stops. a brief reprieve. he gets up and looks around the apartment. sees: magazines. a few revolvers. empty liquor bottles. meth on the counter. and on the stove: a hypodermic needle. beside a pie tin, speed base boiling. jesse stares. he lowers the syringe into the tin, plunger up, drawing fluid... ...then very deliberately sticks catfish's arm with the tip of the needle, pops a cc. catfish bolts awake, eyes wide. a long, wet wheeze.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{where's lucian?}
<A>__{catfish's head lulls. jesse grabs him by the hair. leans in.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{where's lucian?}
<C>__{catfish}
<P>__{(barely audible)}
<D>__{new orleans...}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{new orleans. where in new orleans?}
<C>__{catfish}
<D>__{new orleans...}
<A>__{jesse looks catfish dead in the eyes. and death is there... begging.}
<C>__{jesse}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{i believe you.}
<A>__{with that, jesse pushes the plunger down...ever...so...slowly. blood burps and bubbles from catfish's throat. lungs convulse and spasm. eye go wide then roll back. a suicide dose.}
