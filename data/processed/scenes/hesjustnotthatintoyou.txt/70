<L>__{interior rite aid day}
<A>__{mary and anna, in sweats and ugg boots and dirty hair, both load their carts with cheap beauty products.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i'm not picking out china patterns or anything but i've never felt anything like this before.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{this is crazy. i can't believe he's gonna leave his wife for you.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no, he's not leaving his wife for me. he's just he's a good guy. and he can't really explore what we could be if he's lying to her.}
<A>__{mary looks at her.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{he's kind of leaving his wife for me. is this crazy? this is totally crazy. we barely know each other.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i don't know. remember becca, my sister's friend. some guy waits on her at bennigan's by the end of the night they both knew they had found the one.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you're totally right. it can happen.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{not for me.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{well, what about texter?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{texter has yet to make any verbal contact. i mean, this guy could have had surgery that left him without a voice box, breathing through a stoma, and i'd never know because i never actually hear his voice.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i doubt he has a stoma }
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{that's not the pointerior the point is i can't texterior i'm not charming via texterior my sarcasm doesn't come through, i can't type fast enough on the little phone keyboard }
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{so don't texterior}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{it's not just texting. it's email and voicemail and snail mail }
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{that's just mail }
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{whatever. none of it's working. i've had a guy leave a voicemail for me at work, and then i call him back at home, and he emails me to my blackberry, and then i text him to his cell and then he emails me to my home account from the plane phone and it just totally gets out of hand. i miss the days where you had one phone number with one answering machine that housed one cassette tape and either the cassette tape had a message from the guy or it didn't. that's it. now you have to go around checking all your portals and get rejected by seven different technologies. it's exhausting.}
<A>__{anna, who is trying a different shade of nail polish on each finger, calmly looks up at mary.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{so what about the singer guy?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{jude. yeah, i like him.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{that's great.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{totally. i felt like we connected.}
