<A>__{pulleys as the seamen start to lower. all sound going away... lightoller giving orders, his lips moving... but rose hears only the blood pounding in her ears... this cannot be happening... a rocket bursts above in slow motion, outlining jack in a halo of light... rose's hair blowing in slow motion as she gazes up at him, descending away from him... she sees his hand trembling, the tears at the corners of his eyes, and cannot believe the unbearable pain she is feeling... rose is still staring up, tears pouring down her face. suddenly she is moving. she lunges across the women next to her. reaches the gunwale, climbing it... hurls herself out of the boat to the rail of the a deck promenade, catching it, and scrambling over the rail. the boat 2 continues down. but rose is back on titanic.}
