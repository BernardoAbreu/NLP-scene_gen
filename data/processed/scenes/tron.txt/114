<L>__{interior yori's apartment}
<A>__{as tron and yori enter. the apartment appears to be a box, with one window overlooking the cityscape, and the i 0 tower. at first it looks empty, with strange murals of one dimensional furniture on the walls and floors.}
<C>__{yori}
<D>__{my quarters.}
<C>__{tron}
<D>__{why is everything...like this?}
<C>__{yori}
<D>__{it's a flat. but wait a micro...}
<A>__{she lays her palm on the wall near the door. the door reappears, and a glow starts to fill the room, softly, slowly. tron looks around; the flat paintings of furniture are expanding, filling out, becoming three dimensional. the room glows a soft rose color, becomes charming, soothing. it is still small and limited, but the light in the air and the few pieces of furniture give off a loving, seductive aura. tron turns back to yori, smiling, and stops.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{with her hand still on the wall panel, she is glowing absorbing extra energy, changing. the severe work clothes metamorphosize into shimmering, diaphanous drapery, twinkling with thousands of diamond like points of light. a silvery tinkling sound comes from her robes as she moves forward; her beautiful face, now surrounded by a soft mane of hair, glows with pleasure at the expression in tron's face. she smiles lovingly, and reaches out her hand.}
<C>__{yori}
<D>__{come here.}
<B>__{tron}
<A>__{his face tells the story. the fugitive, returned from long exile, is being fully rewarded for his efforts.}
<C>__{tron}
<D>__{you're beautiful, yori.}
<B>__{shot of them both}
<A>__{as their hands touch, and the glow springs out between their flattened palms. tron pulls her close to him, sliding his hand up her arm, leaving a glowing trace, and her hands move up over his chest.}
<C>__{yori}
<D>__{you've grown, big program.}
<C>__{tron}
<D>__{i had to...in the games...}
<A>__{they move together into an embrace, but their lips never touch. all the energy is transmitted through their hands. they sink down onto what looks like cushions made of stars, their glow increasing. the room fills with the brilliance of the energy they are giving each other, and we hear their sighs, as the music comes up. each of them moves their hands over the other, moving slowly, as if they were trying to touch the other's entire body at once. they roll over and are enveloped in the cloud of stars...}
