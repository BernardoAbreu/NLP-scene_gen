<L>__{interior lao's nightclub office night}
<A>__{the door closes and the bg noise is gone. through a large window (mirrored on the club side) all sorts of activity is visible through automatic mini blinds. a fly vision bank of 12 tv monitors is hot with surveillance. lao, a painfully clean cut, armani clad asian, impeccable, almost dashing, but the dynamic here is crystal clear: nwa is the king: lao, the dark prince in this hierarchy. at the desk, lao is startled from his contemplation of a tiny, perfect rat skeleton by ngo nwa's unheralded entry. the desktop is bare except for and arcane vietnamese fighting knife, half a meter long with an ideogrammed blade, dramatically positioned beneath an artemide lamp. lao rises and feigns servility. nb: the following exchange will play fast, and entirely in}
<B>__{vietnamese.}
<C>__{lao}
<P>__{(formal greeting)}
<C>__{nwa}
<P>__{(dismissiveness, contempt, then chastizing anger as:)}
<A>__{nwa indicates the blade with some ridicule.}
<C>__{lao}
<P>__{(phony assuagement)}
<C>__{nwa}
<P>__{(knows it's bullshit)}
<A>__{lao turns, staring out the blinds, fighting for control. deep breath. he turns back to his "master." nwa gestures broadly at the oppulent office, indicating that lao should be grateful, but is somehow errant}
<C>__{nwa}
<P>__{(respect is required)}
<C>__{lao}
<P>__{(begrudging agreement)}
<A>__{lao sees the blade. an idea. he lifts it reverently, bears it the nwa hilt first in both hands, as if bestowing a thing of immeasurable worth.}
<C>__{ngo nwa}
<P>__{(why give me this?)}
<A>__{nonetheless, nwa accepts the blade. it gleams. hypnotic. even nwa has to admire it. turns it so the blade is pointed at his sternum. his attitude indicates lao is too far away to do anything untoward.}
<C>__{lao}
<P>__{(sinister punchline)}
<A>__{lao spins through the air and heel kicks the blade through nwa's chest, pinning him to the door. it's over so fast the gasp of astonishment never escapes nwa. lao is much more than merely treacherous, he is extremely capable.}
<C>__{lao}
<P>__{(in perfect english)}
<D>__{when i spoke of an offering, i didn't mean an offering to you.}
