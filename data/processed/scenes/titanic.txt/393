<T>__{the hymn plays over the following sequence:}
<L>__{237 a seaman pulls off his lifebelt and catches up to captain smith as he}
<A>__{walks to the bridge. he proffers it, but smith seems to stare through him. without a word he turns and goes onto the bridge. he enters the enclosed wheelhouse and closes the door. he is alone, surrounded by the gleaming brass instruments. he seems to inwardly collapse.}
<L>__{238 in the first class smoking room andrews stands like a statue. he pulls}
<A>__{out his pocketwatch and checks the time. then he opens the face of the mantle clock and adjusts it to the correct time: 2:12 a.m. everything must be correct.}
<L>__{239 in cal's parlour suite water swirls in from the private promenade deck.}
<A>__{rose's paintings are submerged. the picasso tranforms under the water's surface. degas' colors run. monet's water lilies come to life.}
