<L>__{interior chance's room afternoon}
<A>__{a room adjacent to the potting room. a large screen remote control color television set dominates the room. it is on, tuned to the boston pops. in contrast to the new tv, the rest of the room is sparsely but tastefully decorated with expensive furniture of the twenties. there are no books, magazines, newspapers or reading matter of any kind to be seen. chance comes in, watches the tv with a detached gaze as he removes his apron. he changes the channel with the remote control as he puts his apron and the pitchfork rag into a laundry bag. he takes off his suit jacket, hangs it in the closet where it is accompanied by several others, all of like quality. chance changes the channel once again.}
