<A>__{chuck makes a mark on a palm tree. he has completely covered three other trees with marks. it sinks in how long he has been here.}

<A>__{chuck carries the fish back from the beach. now there is a well worn trail.}
<L>__{interior cave that afternoon}
<A>__{chuck enters with the fish. we are greeted with the well ordered lair of a primitive stone age man. clam shell spirals weave in and out around the fire hole. strips of eel jerky and fish hang drying from racks. tools are lined up neatly: digging sticks, stone hammers and saws, spears neatly hafted onto shafts, drills, awls. bits and pieces of feathers, skins, bones, rags, leaves are all neatly arranged. strings and cords hang from hooks. coconut bowls and cooking rocks form a small kitchen. a raincoat and rain hat woven of palm fronds is neatly draped over a frame. evocative pieces of driftwood decorate the room. a wind chime of obsidian flakes sways gently. the watch hangs on a stick. the angel box has the place of honor on one side. on the other side the wilson soccer ball rests on a throne of rocks. seaweed has been placed on the ball as hair. clam shells have been stuck on for eyes, other shells form a mouth. a tube shell and conch form a pipe.}
