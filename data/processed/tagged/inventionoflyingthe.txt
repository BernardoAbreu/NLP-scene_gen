<L>__{exterior caveman village the paleolithic era day}
<A>__{a small caveman community made up of five large caves, all facing out towards a crackling fire. slack jawed, yet strong and confident cavemen stumble about, dragging haunches of meat, pounding the dirt with sticks, dragging the women. we pan over to a small cave. not even really a cave at all, but a crack in the rocks barely large enough to sleep in. stepping out of this "cave" is a small, weak, nerdy looking caveman. the chief caveman, set apart by the large mallet he wields, steps towards the fire and grunts loudly to mark the beginning of a caveman meeting. "loser caveman" steps forward apprehensively, only to be met with laughter from the other cavemen. "loser caveman" sighs and shrinks back into his sad, little cave, watching them from the shadows.}
<C>__{chief caveman}
<P>__{(grunting; subtitled)}
<D>__{me see beast today. beast scary. beast danger for caveman.}
<A>__{the rest of the cavemen look nervous.}
<C>__{chief caveman}
<D>__{if caveman kill beast? caveman safe. caveman have food.}
<A>__{the cavemen grunt in understanding.}
<C>__{chief caveman}
<D>__{who kill beast?}
<A>__{the cavemen grunt amongst themselves. the toughest of the bunch steps forward, pounds his chest and grunts.}
<C>__{chief caveman}
<D>__{grob kill beast. good grob.}
<A>__{the chief notices "loser caveman" watching from a distance.}
<C>__{chief caveman}
<D>__{loser want kill beast?}
<A>__{all the cavemen turn and laugh at the "loser caveman".}
<C>__{chief caveman}
<D>__{loser kill nothing!}
<A>__{all the cavemen laugh hysterically.}
<D>__{caveman #1 look at loser cave! so small! caveman #2 loser dumb! caveman #3 fuck that guy!}
<A>__{all the cavemen pick up rocks and begin throwing them at the "loser caveman", who dives out of his cave and runs around the camp, dodging their blows.}
<L>__{exterior caveman village the paleolithic era night}
<A>__{everyone in the village is asleep. everyone, that is, but "loser caveman" who sleeps uncomfortably in his tiny little cave, tossing and turning, unable to get comfortable. a stirring in the trees causes "loser caveman" to sit upright. there's something outside of the village. something big. suddenly a giant tusked boar pushes through the trees and stands, looking quite menacing, not ten yards from the village fire. "loser caveman" is practically shaking with fear. the boar makes eye contact with "loser caveman" and charges directly towards his tiny little cave. the giant boar runs head first into the cave opening, but the opening is too small for the beast to fit its head inside. "loser caveman" screams like a girl. the boar backs up to strike again this one sure to be the end of "loser caveman" when a large boulder, knocked loose by the boar's first hit, tumbles down and lands smack on the boar's head, killing it instantly. the entire village runs out to see what has happened. the "loser caveman" stumbles out of the cave and dusts himself off. the chief steps forward.}
<C>__{chief caveman}
<D>__{the beast! it dead! caveman #2 hey, look at loser! he almost die! look he scared!}
<A>__{everyone laughs. the chief looks towards loser, standing nervously near the corpse of the giant tusked boar.}
<C>__{chief caveman}
<D>__{loser, what happen?}
<C>__{loser caveman}
<P>__{(shamefully)}
<D>__{the beast, it came at me. it smash my cave.}
<A>__{everyone laughs hysterically. we pan over the many laughing faces, pointing and hooting at loser caveman's cowardice. we watch as the "loser caveman's" face turns bright red, the veins in his neck pop out and his fists clench up tightly. suddenly we fly into the caveman's skull, traveling through his cerebral cortex and towards the frontal lobe of his small, homo erectus brain. sparks are flying back and forth across his brain as his synapses fire in rapid succession. there is a small explosion. we fly back out of "loser caveman's" skull his face contorted in rage. he interrupts everyone's laughter.}
<C>__{loser caveman}
<D>__{hold on one minute!}
<A>__{everyone stops laughing.}
<C>__{loser caveman}
<D>__{loser wasn't finished.}
<A>__{loser caveman stands up straight and tall all of a sudden the bruce willis of cavemen.}
<C>__{loser caveman}
<D>__{after beast smash cave, loser look at beast and say, "not on loser's watch." loser grab rock on ground, lift above head and smash it down... right onto motherfucker's head.}
<A>__{the entire village gasps.}
<C>__{loser caveman}
<D>__{loser kill beast.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{now fuck off, loser going back to sleep.}
<A>__{the chief steps forward ominously, then proclaims:}
<C>__{chief caveman}
<D>__{loser kill beast! loser caveman hero!}
<A>__{loser steps forward, grabs the prettiest of all cavewomen and drags her towards his cave as the entire village erupts in cheer.}
<T>__{freeze frame:}
<C>__{narrator}
<D>__{the world's first lie. a monumental occasion in the history of mankind.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{that lowly caveman who stumbled upon the ability to lie went on to become chief of his village, married dozens of cavewomen, and passed on the lying gene to hundreds of newborn cave children.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{over time lying spread throughout the world, sparking the eventual birth of imagination itself, story telling, religion, and the oh so important polite lie, as in, "oh patty, have you lost weight? you look fantastic."}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{the world would be a very different place if events had gone otherwise on that prolific, paleolithic eve. if not for that night, man would have never acquired the ability to lie to himself and to others.}

<C>__{chief caveman}
<D>__{loser, what happen?}
<C>__{loser caveman}
<P>__{(shamefully)}
<D>__{the beast, it came at me. it smash my cave.}
<A>__{again we fly into the caveman's skull, traveling through his homo erectus brain. sparks are flying back and forth across his brain as his synapses fire in rapid succession... but this time there's no explosion. we fly back out of "loser caveman's" skull his face contorted in rage. the rage slowly fades and loser just stands there, everyone in the camp waiting for him to say something.}
<C>__{loser caveman}
<D>__{rock fall on beast. loser do nothing. i think loser even soil bear pants.}
<P>__{(pause; sniffing)}
<D>__{loser smell bad.}
<A>__{everyone falls onto the ground laughing hysterically.}
<C>__{chief caveman}
<D>__{loser biggest loser ever! caveman, throw rocks at loser!}
<A>__{everyone in the camp joins in on another round of throwing rocks at "loser caveman" as he runs around the camp, terrified and miserable.}

<P>__{(shouting back)}
<D>__{yeah, i'm disappointed you're early and not really looking forward to tonight in general, but the thought of being alone the rest of my life scares both my mother and i equally.}
<A>__{it's completely silent for a long beat. mark looks around, then sits on her couch.}
<C>__{mark}
<P>__{(shouting to her)}

<A>__{more silence.}
<C>__{mark}

<D>__{i'm embarrassed because i think the restaurant i've made reservations at might not be expensive enough or hip enough to impress you, but it was the best i could do because i don't make very much money. you see, i'm forty years old and have no real financial assets to speak of, i've never owned a home, and never had a significant relationship. my boss even told me today that i'm most likely going to get fired tomorrow and...}

<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i don't know any of them.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{in fact, there are very few things in life that i care about all that much. the only things i have to offer myself or anyone else are my good looks and my affected sense of quirkiness which artistically inclined men interpret as intellect.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<D>__{in fact, i think my best trait is the fact that i've made very few mistakes: socially, academically, financially or romantically. i take very few risks and therefore lead a relatively happy and light hearted existence. mostly though, i'm a kind, sweet person with the potential of genuinely becoming a vital and interesting human being the day i take the energy i expend on hyper self reflexivity and apply it to actual action in the reality of my life.}

<D>__{how do you spend your days?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i get up at eight in the morning because the noise from my alarm clock interrupts my sleep, so i lean over and...}

<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{no. but i enjoy the end result of the job which is money. and the hours are pretty good for the amount of money i make, which i spend on things i like, such as clothes, hiking, drinking even though i know it's bad for me.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{but i'd rather just get all the money and not work for the results.}

<C>__{jim}
<D>__{hi, i'm jim and i'm the spokesperson for the coca cola company. i'm here today to ask you to continue buying coke. i'm sure it's a drink you've been drinking for years, and if you still enjoy it, i'd like to remind you to buy it again sometime soon. it's basically just brown sugar water, we haven't changed the ingredients much lately, so there's nothing new about it i can say. we changed the can around a little bit. see, the colors here are a little different, and we even put a polar bear on it for the kids. also, coke is very high in sugar, can lead to obesity in children and adults who don't sustain a healthy diet, and has a ph acidity level high enough to dissolve teeth and bones over extended periods of time. coke also works great at removing corrosion from car batteries and loosening rusted bolts. so that's it, it's coke. everyone knows it. it's very famous. i'm jim, i work for coke, and i'm asking you to not stop buying coke. that's all. thanks.}

<L>__{interior lecture films mark's office morning}
<A>__{mark's office is completely boring and unremarkable, much like his apartment. there's a knock on his door. anthony enters, looking very much the boss in his expensive suit, yet nervous and fearful as well.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{wow, you look really depressed today. that's going to make this so much harder.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{anthony, don't fire me.}
<A>__{anthony sits down on the other side of mark's desk and leans forward.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{mark, the 1300's are boring. nothing interesting happened in that century. nobody cares about the post roman, pre enlightenment era. the last few scripts you turned in were depressing.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{they were about the black plague! it's the 1300's anthony, what else am i going to write about!}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{it's not totally your fault, mark. you got stuck with a bad century.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{no! i can make it work!}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{give it up mark, it's not like something new is going to have happened in the 1300's. at lecture films we're no longer interested in searching through the less well known historical periods for great events, we just want to take the big name reader's of the day and have them read the historical events that people know and love: the holocaust, d day, the birth of electricity. these are the stories people want to see, because they know them. they find comfort in them.}
<A>__{anthony pauses.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{do you think i could come back and do this tomorrow? i just got very nervous about firing you. i don't do well with confrontation.}
<C>__{mark}

<D>__{you're fired?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{damn.}
<A>__{anthony slinks out of the room. mark looks down at his computer to see he has an email in his inbox. angle on: mark's computer the email reads: "i woke up this morning, sober, and realized that, while i did enjoy your company, based on your looks, your financial situation and your position in life, i have no interest in you romantically. i'm just too far out of your league. jennifer" mark sits back in his chair and sighs deeply.}

<D>__{i often fantasized about you naked.}

<C>__{mark}

<C>__{rob}
<D>__{so they fucking fired you, huh dipshit? i always knew the black plague would never work as a movie. guess the 1300's were as much of a loser as you are.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{please don't make me feel worse. or actually whatever, go ahead, i don't think i could possibly feel worse.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i fucking always hated you. you're a shitty writer assigned to a shitty century and you're a little man bitch. but i was always threatened by you because i knew there was something different about you that i didn't understand and i fucking hate things i don't understand. but you will always be a loser and i will always be more successful than you in nearly every way. that's just the way it is. and shelley calls you an ass fag behind your back.}

<C>__{mark}
<D>__{see, you had it on the wrong channel. it needs to be on channel three in order for the satellite to work.}

<D>__{i don't understand anything you just said and that makes me scared and angry.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i can't understand what it feels like to be you so it just irritates me and makes me think you're stupid. but i also love you and wish things were better for you.}

<C>__{martha}
<D>__{i don't think i'm a loser.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{of course you're a loser, grandma. our family is made up of losers. we're all poor, we're all average looking, we're all only moderately intelligent, we're all lonely and unloved.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{well, we're poor because we weren't born with money and it's very hard to make enough money in a single lifetime to move from one social class to another. we're only moderately intelligent because there's been a lot of inbreeding in our lineage. and we're only lonely and unloved right now. remember, i've had two husbands i loved very much in my lifetime.}
<C>__{martha }
<D>__{and maybe one day you'll have a wife that you love very much too.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yeah, but i'm not talking about the past, grandma. i'm talking about right now. and right now we're both losers, grandma. we're both shitty, shitty losers. don't you know that?}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{i suppose we are. but things could be worse. we could be homeless.}
<C>__{mark}

<D>__{twenty seven red. no one wins.}

<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'm on twenty seven red.}
<A>__{the dealer looks at this. his brain takes a moment to respond.}
<C>__{roulette dealer}
<D>__{we have a winner. congratulations, sir.}
<A>__{the dealer stacks up mark's new chips and pushes them over to him.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{you did it. you just, like, quadrupled your money. you lucky son of a bitch.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{that's nothing. watch this.}
<A>__{mark puts all of his chips on double zero. a bunch of other people scatter their chips around the table as well.}
<C>__{roulette dealer}
<D>__{get your bets in, get your bets in. the house always wins in the long run. fork over your money right here folks. i say this so often i want to kill myself.}
<A>__{the dealer spins the ball. it comes to a halt on nine black.}
<C>__{roulette dealer}
<D>__{nine black. no winners.}
<A>__{mark takes all of the chips on the table, both his and everyone else's and slides them together into a giant pile and sits them right on nine black.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'm on nine black. these are all mine.}
<A>__{the table cheers for mark. some people are a bit confused, and a slight hubbub arises in the background: "i thought i had chips on the table." "yeah, me too." "we must be drunk." "that guys is lucky!" even the dealer looks a bit confused... but gets over it quickly.}
<C>__{roulette dealer}
<D>__{nine black wins. big winner. congratulations, sir.}

<C>__{mark}
<D>__{well, sort of.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{it was like we couldn't lose.}

<D>__{do you have a system?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i've got a system.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{well, with your system in just a few weeks i figure we could be the richest people in the world.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{and then what?}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{well, here's what i'm thinking. we take all the money in the world... and put it on black.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{why put it on black? why stop there? put it on a number and get thirty five times back.}
<A>__{greg's eyes widen at the thought.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{that's exactly what we'll do.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{hold on, i think i found a flaw in your plan. how can they pay us if we have all the money in the world?}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{well, they'd just have to.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{well, they can't because we've got it all.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{well, they'd better find it. they can't let us bet if they're not going to pay us back. they'll have to just give us the casino.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{we already own the casino. we've got all the money in the world. we'll be betting against ourselves.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{then we'll go to another casino.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{we own that one too. we won that.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{so we own all the casino's?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yup.}

<D>__{i'm as excited as i've ever been in my entire life, and equally scared. mark (v.o.) (cont'd) i'm writing this down in a letter in case this thing i've discovered somehow ends up killing me. i want to ensure that, even if i wasn't strong enough to use it, that my invention doesn't once again disappear, never to be discovered again.}

<C>__{mark }
<D>__{now, to explain my invention. in essence, my creation is the act of saying words that simply are not. for example, if i tell someone that my eyes are blue, then it simply becomes fact. i still know that, indeed, my eyes are brown, but no one else is aware of this fact, so therefore i have blue eyes. mark (v.o.) (cont'd) it's a game of numbers: there is only one of me who knows i have brown eyes, and so many of them who do not. the numbers always win.}

<D>__{ah, my family. we're what you'd probably call "not lucky". my whole family is kind of marked by tragedy, bad luck and general... shittiness. it goes back a long ways and could probably drive someone to suicide just hearing about it, so i will keep it simple. my mom died when i was six. cancer.}

<D>__{what are you talking about she's going to die?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{i'm sorry. it just doesn't look good. she's suffered a major heart attack and her heart is very weak, her pulse not very strong, her blood pressure is dropping rapidly and most likely she'll have a fatal heart attack during the night.}

<D>__{fuck.}
<A>__{the doctor checks martha's chart.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{yup, still going to die.}

<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{i'm sorry, guys. i wish i felt something for you two, but i really don't. i do this exact thing about thirty times a night and it's really hardened me to human suffering. on a side note, it's fajita night at the cafeteria downstairs. you might think about grabbing a bite to eat there after your grandma dies.}
<A>__{the doctor leaves. mark holds his grandmother's hand, her hand is shaking.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{i'm so scared, mark. i don't want to die. you know, people don't talk about it much, but death is a horrible thing. one minute you're alive, there's a whole world around you, humming and jumping, people coming in and out, doors opening and closing, love and anger and the whole mess of it all, and then like that, it's all gone.}
<P>__{(crying)}
<D>__{this is it mark, only a few hours left of this until an eternity of nothingness.}

<D>__{listen closely to me, grandma. i have a surprise for you.}
<A>__{we focus on mark and his grandmother, inches from one another as the paramedics busy themselves around martha's dying body.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you're wrong about what happens when you die. it's not an eternity of nothingness.}
<A>__{martha is hanging on to every word mark is saying.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{when you die you're going to go to your favorite place in the whole world. and you're going to be with all of the people you've ever loved and who have ever loved you. and you're going to be young again, and you'll be able to run through the fields and dance and jump, and there will be no sadness, no pain, just love and laughing and happiness. there will be ponies made of gold, and everyone will live in giant mansions, and everything will smell like cookies. and it will last for an eternity, grandma. an eternity.}
<A>__{tears are rolling down martha's face as a glimmering smile overtakes her face. mark looks up to see the nurses, paramedics and doctors all staring at mark in total shock.}

<C>__{mark}
<D>__{look, they're still the same products you have on the shelves right now. the only difference now is that people won't get bummed out or scared when they use them. isn't that a good thing?}

<A>__{we follow a suburban housewife as she pushes her shopping cart through the aisles of a bright and shiny super market. she picks up a six pack of coke and notices the label: "new coke it tastes great! and it's good for you!" the housewife smiles widely and enthusiastically tosses it in her cart. series of cuts: the housewife grabbing different products, marveling at the new, improved features: "cures sadness!", "tastes better than real chicken!", "this candy is all your body needs to survive!" with a full cart the housewife wheels it to the checkout counter to find swarms of people already there, all of their carts bursting to the brim with new, exciting products. everyone looks excited and happy.}

<A>__{back at his old stomping ground, mark sits at the bar by himself drinking coffee and watching the tv. greg sits next to him, with two boxes of cookies and a liter of coke in front of him. different newspapers are spread out on the bar, all of them with similar headlines, "world rocked by new healthy products", "people everywhere line up for guilt free treats", "you can eat cake all the time!". angle on tv: a fat man is being interviewed in front of a super market, he holds a bag full of junk food in front of him.}
<C>__{fat man}
<D>__{thank the man in the sky for this. i've never been happier in my life. now i can eat whatever i want, whenever i want.}

<C>__{greg}
<D>__{why's that?}
<C>__{mark}

<L>__{interior mark's car day}
<A>__{mark drives while we take in a bit of his world, highlighting the various changes he's wrought. a homeless man stands on the street corner with a sign that now reads, "screw it. i will be in my mansion soon." he has a big smile on his face. the same business man pulls up beside mark's car, this time eating a giant donut and talking loudly into his cell phone.}

<D>__{the more you push me away, the more attracted i am to you.}

<D>__{nothing's really changed. i gave people the man in the sky, made myself rich and successful, told the world they can eat whatever they want and feel good about it. everyone's happy but me. because i'm the only one who knows it all... isn't. i made it all up.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you're not up there living in a mansion. you're right here. in the ground. that's all. and i'm the only one who knows that.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{and the one thing i want i can't have. because the world is too stupid to change. the world only cares about what they can see, and what they can know, and what they're used to and what... makes sense. no one listens to what they really want. and that's why i will always just be a loser, grandma. and that's why i will always be alone.}
