<A>__{the brothers are brokenhearted at the sight of her. they love their sister. but there are stronger forces here. a mirror on a wall beside howard cracks down the middle.}

<D>__{we gotta go!}
<A>__{bulgar looks up to denver. they exchange a look of deep affection and pained longing. he wants to take her.}

<D>__{bye? bul?}
<A>__{bulgar is starting to cry. he rushes up the steps and hugs his sister. he kisses her hard then breaks away. denver's outstretched hand misses his shirt and hangs mid air.}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{no..bul...}
<A>__{bulgar flies down the steps and disappears out of the house holding howard's hand once more. denver sits alone at the top of the stairs. she sadly looks up and weeps, as if to the house itself:}
