<L>__{interior neural net chamber night}
<A>__{camera moves over tubes and fiber optic cables, which run into multiple glass cylinders filled with translucent pink liquid. these contain human brains... there are hundreds of them hooked up in here.}
<C>__{serena}
<D>__{a boy and a girl in the last day or two?}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{yes... what is this place?}
<C>__{serena}
<D>__{part of the neural net human minds linked directly with artificial intelligence. the processing power of the human brain is still beyond anything skynet can manufacture.}
<A>__{serena has moved to a computer terminal, one of a few here.}
<C>__{serena }
<D>__{display recent arrivals for processing.}
<A>__{images begin to appear on the screen small inset photos, each with a barcode. they quickly fill the screen. marcus leans forward, squinting. on screen dozens of faces, photos taken inside the tubes, mostly looking terrified. marcus shakes his head.}
<C>__{serena }
<D>__{next page...}
<A>__{on screen a new set of faces appears one by one on the screen. this time, star and kyle are among them, next to each other.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{that's them.}
<A>__{marcus touches the screen, two fingers, one on each of the kid's faces. their images expand to fill the screen, side by side, kyle on the left. kyle's image, the date 10.16.18... the time, 22:19:23. the word, in green: processed. serena smiles.}
<C>__{serena}
<D>__{good news. he'll soon be part of the network you'll be able to connect with him.}
<A>__{move to star's image. 10.15.18... 22:20:49... and the word, in red: terminated.}
<C>__{serena }
<D>__{i'm sorry about the girl, marcus. she didn't suffer.}
<A>__{marcus takes this in, his face shows pain. then serena grasps his hand in moments, he's smiling.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{of course. i... i understand.}
<A>__{suddenly the building shakes, the sound of a distant explosion. serena releases marcus, listens in her earpiece.}
<C>__{marcus }
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{serena}
<D>__{i don't know i have to go. will you be all right?}
<P>__{(off his smile and nod)}
<D>__{of course you will.}
<A>__{she touches him once more and moves off, leaving him alone here. we'll hear other far off explosions from time to time during the following. marcus stares at his friends' faces, which slowly fade to black: , replaced by his own reflection. seeing his own face, his smile vanishes. marcus is going through a terrible internal struggle, the interface fighting his own natural emotions. he backs away from the machine, looks around at the brains, all the lives destroyed. hurrying past the wall of brains, he moves a hand to the base of his skull... with an angry cry his fingers dig into the plastic skin at the back of his head marcus grits his teeth, this is incredibly hard to do, but he rips the interface module from his skull connections spark, we glimpse steel skull and the encased brain beneath. marcus hurls the device to the floor, its elaborate circuitry shatters. he reels with momentary anguish at what he's just given up then he moves out of there with determination.}
