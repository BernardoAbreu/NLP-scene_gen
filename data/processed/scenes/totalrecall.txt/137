<A>__{a patrol of nine heavily armed guards appear from a corridor in level one directly above where quail and melina are climbing.}
<L>__{128 on the wall of the shaft}
<A>__{quail and melina's heads inch into view at floor level. they take one peek at these formidable warriors and duck back swiftly out of sight.}

<C>__{guard leader}
<P>__{(to two of his men)}
<D>__{stay in contact. i want to hear from this checkpoint every four minutes.}
<A>__{seven of the guards move off, two remain in position. we hear the footsteps of the seven guards recede. the two remaining guards realize their isolation; they glance tensely to one another.}
<D>__{guard #1 did you hear something? guard #2 no. where? guard #1 over there.}
<A>__{the first guard points to the edge of the main shaft right where quail and melina are hiding. the guards cock their weapons, start cautiously forward. just as they're about to peer over the brink, guns at the ready:}
<C>__{quail's voice }
<P>__{(from behind the guards)}
<D>__{i'm not there, boys. i'm here.}
<A>__{the guards spin around, weapons poised. standing in the shadows, near the corridor, is quail! (still with no gun) both guards walk quickly toward quail, covering him with their weapons.}
<D>__{guard #1}
<P>__{(to guard #2)}
<D>__{watch him. he was eio trained. they're all full of tricks. guard #2 yeah? like...who was that guy? fred bond??}
<P>__{(to quail)}
<D>__{keep 'em up, fred, keep 'em up.}
<A>__{quail has his arms raised high. just as the guards reach him, he fizzes electronically, emitting a humming sound, then disappears.}
<D>__{guard #1 a hologram!}
<A>__{before either guard can react, the real quail appears one foot behind them. with two lightning blows, he dispatches the guards. (apparently quail has climbed out of the shaft while the guards were distracted.) quail snatches both guards' weapons, grenades and ammo belts. melina climbs out of the shaft. quail tosses her one of the guard's guns.}
