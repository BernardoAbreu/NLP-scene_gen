<D>__{dude, weak... can't go on... dizzy...}
<A>__{stan falls to the ground. his face plops in the rainy mud and his head smacks against a rock. stan is out cold. just then, a strange sound emerges. it is like a pulsating wobble. stan slowly awakes, picks up his head and shines his flashlight around.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{what is that?}
<A>__{the sound gets louder. stan shines his flashlight on something that is huge and throbbing.}
