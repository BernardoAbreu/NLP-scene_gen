<L>__{exterior apartment building. evening.}
<A>__{elaine on her way in. handsome woman. intelligent, capable looking. passes wilson who's leaning somewhere smoking.}
<B>__{elaine}
<A>__{aware as a wary woman will be of a strange man's presence without necessarily having looked at him. well aware too that he stayed where he was so she unworriedly unlocks the building's security gate and goes through to the inner }
<B>__{courtyard}
<A>__{ and closes the gate behind her, now seeing him amble up, arriving as it clicks shut between them. he's looking at her a certain way. she looks back. and knows.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{you're jenny's father.}
<A>__{and the recognition on his part:}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{had a feeling it was you.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{you look alike.}
<C>__{wilson}
<P>__{(cigarette in hand)}
<D>__{perhaps it was the smoke.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{not her brand.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{she used to pinch 'em off me.}
<P>__{(trying to defuse elaine's cold stare)}
<D>__{funny that. one thing she never tried to get me to stop.}
<A>__{elaine doesn't soften.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{why did you come here?}
<C>__{wilson}

<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{i was skint didn't have no money to get here.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{that's not what i heard.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{what was that, then?}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{i heard you were what's that adorable phrase? "at her majesty's pleasure."}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{it was the bars, then.}
<A>__{indicating his face, viewed by elaine through the barred security gate that divides them.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{in any case, i don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{sewing mailbags? me? never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. wasn't about to start when i was in stir not with all that leisure time on my hands.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{and not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out. from the wembley staduim job, wasn't it? pink floyd concert receipts. jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?}
<C>__{wilson}
<P>__{(trying to conceal his surprise)}
<D>__{hardly buried. earning interest, love. earning interest in an offshore account. tidy little premium per annum, that.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{well, that kind of security can't be bought. must be more comforting than a daughter to greet you.}
<A>__{she turns to walk away.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{here, aren't you gonna let me in.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(without looking back)}
