<L>__{interior cabin galley day}
<A>__{whip exits the lavatory drying his hands with a towel. he looks down the aisle to see trina far down the cabin. trina sees whip, comes back up the aisle and stands with her back to him watching the passengers. whip opens a bottle of orange juice and takes a big swig. he then pours half of it in the sink. whip places the open juice bottle on the liquor cart, reaches up, and grabs the cabin mic to address the passengers.}

<D>__{folks, this is captain whitaker. if you look up, i'm here in the galley. i will wave to you.}
<A>__{whip steps into the aisle so the passengers can see him. whip waves with a calm smile that would put anyone at ease.}
<C>__{whip }
<D>__{good morning. i apologize for the bumps, but florida just doesn't seem to like us georgians. must be the beatin' the bulldogs put on the gators last fall.}
<A>__{titters of laughter from the passengers as whip moves the half step he needs to put himself behind the liquor cart.}
<C>__{whip }
<D>__{stretch out and relax. the air might stay a little cranky so i'm gonna ask that you sit tight if you can, with your seat belts fastened.}
<A>__{we now watch from behind whip as his free hand reaches into the top drawer of the liquor cart and pulls three small vodka bottles out.}
<C>__{whip }
<D>__{we won't have beverage service but the girls will walk through with water and snacks and i will have you in atlanta in about 40 minutes. thank you.}
<A>__{whip puts the mic to its hook. alone in the galley and out of view, he quickly empties the vodkas into the orange juice bottle and replaces the cap. whip shakes the juice as he tosses the little empties into the galley trash. whip takes a healthy pull from the spiked juice, downing nearly half. whip knocks on the cockpit door. margaret emerges and whip disappears in to the cockpit.}
