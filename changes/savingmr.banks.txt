She wraps her arms tightly around her chest, lifts her face to the sky, a half-smile threatening to break across her concentrated face. This is the young P.L.

Older, beautiful; striking blue eyes aid her air of stiff and steely determination. Her office is a canvas of a life well travelled. Buddha smiles from every corner, framed poetry and letters adorn the walls alongside pictures of Pamela throughout the years with men we will not come to know and everywhere, china hens sit on shelves, their wings clasped to their chests, brooding. Despite the multitude of objects, the room is peaceful, white. Downstairs the doorbell rings. Pamela closes her eyes, breathes. It rings again, Pamela shakes her head, tuts. She stands up, smooths down her skirt with flat palms. Breathes.}
