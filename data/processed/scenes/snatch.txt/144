<C>__{vinny}
<D>__{stop! i can see it. i can see the stone.}
<A>__{hands at the point of entry stops. vinny hops over to the stone and picks it up. tony lets the dog stand but keeps a grip oh the collar. the dog is relieved to be semi liberated. hands is still on his knees armed with an incredulous stare.}
<C>__{hands}
<D>__{well let's see it.}
<A>__{vinny holds it up. there's a sense of relief. he then throws the stone, it cuts through the air. and the dog seeing another projectile runs to intercept it. there's a pause while all now focus again on the dog. this is digested literally and mentally. the dog recognizes all the attention it's receiving. and goes through the motions of swallowing it. hands attempts an approach. the dog understandably feels uncomfortable about the advancing vanguard and decides emergency action is needed, and seeing the open window launches itself out of it.}
