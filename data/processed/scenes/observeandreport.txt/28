<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{just putting these posters up.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{you've been so obsessed with catching this pervert i've barely seen you.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{that's what it's like when you date the head of mall security. the downside is we don't get to see each other as much, but the upside is you get to brag to all your friends.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{well, are you ready to go?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{sure, let's take off.}
