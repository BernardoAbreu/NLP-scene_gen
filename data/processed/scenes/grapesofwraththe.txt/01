<C>__{bert}
<D>__{i figgered no. 3 was about ready to pay off.}
<A>__{the scene fades out. the arizona border, in daylight, fades in. it is in a gap in the mountains and beyond can be seen the painted desert. a border guard halts the joad truck. he is not as tough as his words indicate, just curt and matter of fact.}

<C>__{tom}
<D>__{sure. we aim to.}
<A>__{the truck rattles into movement. the scene dissolves to a montage superimposed on the shield marker of u.s. highway 66 and the joad truck. signs flash by: flagstaff, water 5 a gal, water 10 a gal, water 15 a gal, and finally, needles, calif. in the foreground, their backs turned, the joads stand on and about their truck looking in a long silence at what can be seen of california from needles. their silence is eloquent. the faces of the joads are blank with dismay, for this is an unattractive sight indeed.}

<A>__{the joads and the landscape are seen again. then the scene dissolves to the bank of a river. the camp at needles is on the bank of the colorado river, among some willows. we see the man of the family sitting chest deep in the shallow waters, talking, occasionally ducking their heads under, reveling in this relief. in the background are the towering mountains.}

<A>__{her head rests again. she lies looking fixedly at the still face. the scene dissolves to an inspection station, near daggett, california, at night. obeying a sign that reads: "keep right and stop," the joad truck pulls up under a long shed as two officers, yawning, come out to inspect it. one takes down the license number and opens the hood. the people aboard the truck bestir themselves sleepily.}

<C>__{rosasharn}
<D>__{i like the tent better.}
<C>__{ma}
<D>__{this got a floor. wouldn't leak when it rains.}
<A>__{outside, a clerk with glasses appears, pushing a cart loaded with three gallon buckets.}

<D>__{name?}

<P>__{(to tom)}
<D>__{all y'all go. me an' rosasharn'll unload.}
<A>__{with their buckets they shuffle away toward the peach trees tom, pa, uncle john, al, and the two children struggling with the enormous containers. the scene dissolves to the interior of house 63 at night, a lantern lighting the scene. sitting wherever they can, the joads have finished their supper of hamburgers. and grateful they are too, for the meat.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(wiping his mouth)}
<D>__{got any more, ma?}
<C>__{ma}

<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(leaving)}
<D>__{okay, ma. don't you worry.}
<A>__{in the ranch street. there is a faint moonlight, but not much, and little sound from the other houses as tom strolls down the street. near the gate: beyond, cars pass. as tom approaches the gate a flashlight plays on his face suddenly and a guard rises from a box.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{where you think you're going?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{thought i'd take a walk. any law against it?}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{well, you just turn around and walk the other way.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you mean i can't even get outa here?}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{not tonight you can't. want to walk back? or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i will walk back.}
<A>__{the guard watches him as he walks back and then douses his flashlight. at a section of wire fence, watching his chance, moving silently, tom drops on the ground, on his back, gets his head under the bottom wire, and pushes himself under and outside. rising, he crosses the paved highway. an embankment across the road from the wire fence: tom clambers down it, moving quietly. he picks his way down the shallow ravine. a tent: there is a light inside and there are the shadows of figures. in the background, beyond the tent, is the silhouette of a small concrete bridge spanning a small stream. following a trail, tom enters and approaches the tent. (the opening is away from him.) in front of the tent, a man sitting on a box looks up suspiciously as tom enters. his name is joe.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{evenin'.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{jus' goin' pas', that's all.}

<C>__{tom}
<D>__{no. jus' goin' pas', i tell you.}
<A>__{a head sticks out of the tent. until he speaks, tom does not recognize casy.}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{casy! what you doin' here?}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{well, if it ain't tom joad. how ya, boy?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{thought you was in jail.}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{no, i done my time an' got out. come on in.}
<P>__{(he pulls tom into the tent.)}
<A>__{inside the tent, three other men sit on the ground as casy brings tom in. one's name is frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{this the fella you been talkin' about?}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{this is him. what you doin' here, tommy?}

<D>__{well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{fi' cents! they pain' you fi' cents?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{sure. we made a buck since midday.}
<C>__{casy}
<P>__{(after a long silence)}
<D>__{lookie, tom. we come to work here. they tell us it's gonna be fi' cents. but they was a whole lot of us, so the man says two an' a half cents. well, a fella can't even eat on that, an' if he got kids...}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{so we says we won't take it. so they druv us off. now they're payin' you five but when they bust this strike ya think they'll pay five?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i dunno. payin' five now.}

<P>__{(soberly)}
<D>__{i don't expeck we can las' much longer some a the folks ain't et for two days. you goin' back tonight?}
<C>__{tom}

<C>__{casy}
<P>__{(earnestly)}
<D>__{well tell the folks inside how it is, tom. tell 'em they're starvin' us and stabbin' theirself in the back. an' as sure as god made little apples it's goin' back to two an' a half jus' as soon as they clear us out.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(suddenly)}
<D>__{you hear sump'n?}
<A>__{they listen. then:}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i will tell 'em. but i don't know how. never seen so many guys with guns. wouldn't even let us talk today.}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{try an' tell 'em, tom. they'll get two an' a half, jus' the minute we're gone. an' you know what that is? that's one ton a peaches picked an' carried for a dollar. that way you can't even buy food enough to keep you alive! tell 'em to come out with us, tom! them peaches is ripe. two days out an' they'll pay all of us five!}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{they won't. they're a gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else.}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{but jus' the minute they ain't strike breakin' they won't get no five!}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{an' the nex' thing you know you'll be out, because they got it all figgered down to a t until the harvest is in you're a migrant worker afterwards, just a bum.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{five they're a gettin' now, an' that's all they're int'rested in. i know exackly what pa'd say. he'd jus' say it wasn't none a his business.}
<C>__{casy}
<P>__{(reluctantly)}
<D>__{i guess that's right. have to take a beatin' before he'll know.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{we was outa food. tonight we had meat. not much, but we had it. think pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? an' rosasharn needs milk. think ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?}
<C>__{casy}
<P>__{(sadly)}
<D>__{got to learn, like i'm a learnin'. don't know it right yet myself, but i'm tryin' to fin' out. that's why i can't ever be a preacher again. preacher got to know.}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}

<C>__{joe}
<D>__{can't tell. seems like i hear sump'n, an' then i listen an' they ain't nothin' to hear.}

<D>__{all of us a little itchy. cops been tellin' us how they gonna beat us up an' run us outa the country. not them reg'lar deppities, but them tin star fellas they got for guards.}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{they figger i'm the leader because i talk so much.}
<A>__{frank's head sticks in the door. his voice is an excited whisper.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{turn out that light an' come outside. they's sump'n here.}
<A>__{quickly casy turns the light down and out. he gropes for the door, followed by tom and the other man.}
