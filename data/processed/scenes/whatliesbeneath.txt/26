<L>__{interior foyer night}
<A>__{the foyer's empty, but the front door is open. claire nervously walks out and looks around.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{cooper!}
<A>__{pov the garden no sign of the dog. claire turns to go back inside. when she touches the doorknob, she hears the whispering again. a fleeting shadow draws her eye to a coat rack mirror which reflects directly into the study.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{hello...?!}
<A>__{the whispering stops.}
<L>__{interior norman's lab night}
<A>__{claire walks in to find norman surrounded by several grad students. at school he's a very different man; pressed shirt and tie, hair neatly brushed back. they're preforming some unseen procedure on a live sheep in a containment harness. she stops by the door to watch him.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{...and then what...courtney?}
<A>__{an intense asian girl answers.}
<C>__{courtney}
<D>__{we administer the halothane.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{dosage?}
<A>__{she glances at her notes.}
<C>__{courtney}
<D>__{three point five cc's.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{excellent. properties? andrew from downtown...}
<A>__{andrew, tall razor thin, was waiting for this.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{an organic, neuromuscular blocking agent, which when administered in aerosol form temporarily renders the subject immobile.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{nothing but net.}
<A>__{he measures out the liquid from a blue plastic bottle into an apparatus connected to an inhalation mask on the sheep.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{prudence here's an old friend.}
<A>__{he moves to the sheep's head and strokes it as he nods to courtney who turns a valve on the apparatus. the sheep suddenly goes completely still. norman moves around and begins a brief procedure.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i try to stay on her good side because i owe her my career and most of our grant money. why else?}
<A>__{he completes the procedure. they look at him blankly.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{always do unto others as you'd have others do unto your ewe.}
<A>__{groans, laughter. he stops claire.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{that'll do it. write this up for tuesday!}
<A>__{andrew and amy tend to prudence, the rest leave. claire moves over to him. they kiss. norman packs notes and some of the chemicals into a leather case.}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(warm)}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{there were some noises. i didn't want to disturb you.}
<A>__{she watches as the sheep slowly becomes reanimated and is led out of the room.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{what do you mean? some noises where?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{in the house. i was scared.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{did you call the police?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{no. can you drive me home? i will bring you back in the morning.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{he takes her arm.}
