<A>__{grady steps outside in a woman's chenille bathrobe and plucks the pittsburgh post gazette from the second porch step. he fishes out a charred roach, starts to light it, then notices the galaxie sitting in the driveway.}

<A>__{as crabtree snores thunderously, grady eases open the door, spots the car keys on the dresser, grabs them.}

<L>__{interior emily's office}
<A>__{grady pushes open the door with the tips of his fingers, lets it glide open. the room that is revealed is bright and well ordered, in direct contrast to the lazy clutter of grady's office. there is a drafting table and a computer, pads and pens neatly arranged alongside. a bulliten board hangs on one wall, bearing an intricate mosaic of multi colored index cards. there are prints, framed, from various art exhibits, and two of grady's dhstjackets including, most prominently, arsonist's daughter. there are photographs of emily too. in a black turtleneck with friends. in a sundress with grady. in a billowing burberry, floating like a dark butterfly against a blur of yellow taxis on a street in manhattan. smiling brilliantly. beautiful.}
