<D>__{you eat it first. i don't know if they put something in it.}
<L>__{exterior sidewalk near bank day}
<A>__{moretti, sheldon, other top cops march fast time toward the barrier where uniformed cops stand around a limousine that has drawn up to the barrier. it is full of white haired officials, one of them the commissioner. he has a voice broken by whiskey, cigars, good food and yelling at football games.}
<B>__{dolly at a low dramatic angle with moretti and etc.}
<A>__{it looks like they may be going into action. moretti's attitude is not that subtly different now he's talking to brass. commissioner doesn't get out; he talks through window. the commissioner's hand, pudgy and freckled with age, covers moretti's where it rests on the door: he massages moretti's hand fondly.}
<C>__{commissioner}
<D>__{gene you smilin'?}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{no. i never smile any more.}
<C>__{commissioner}
<D>__{whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, gene?}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{i never make bets or guesses, that way i'm never wrong and i never have to pay out.}
<C>__{commissioner}
<D>__{gene, jesus, what a bull he is!}
<A>__{a lot of comfortable chuckles inside the limo. the commissioner's hand lingers on moretti's they are fond of each other, these men, linked in a relationship of a lifetime of shared experience, of attitudes, of maleness an accumulation of years of jokes about being late for dinner, of women waiting and women panting with desire, men secure in the bastion of their roles. what is being passed on here is a purely emotional force of approval and acceptance from top to bottom of a social institution that is the last totally masculine society: police. the homosexual content of this should not be lost: it lies in the comfortable fit of their feelings, in the fact, simply, that they love each other, for what they share.}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{so whatsa deal?}
<C>__{commissioner}
<D>__{they jet's comin' out. but don't let 'em off the ground.}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{what if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?}
<C>__{commissioner}
<D>__{don't let 'em off the ground.}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{listen.}
<A>__{he leans down to get close to his commissioner, because he's not fooled by the camaraderie into a false sense of security. tighter two shot moretti and commissioner}
<C>__{commissioner}
<P>__{(anticipating)}
<D>__{if you're right i'm gonna back you a hundred percent, you know that.}
<C>__{moretti}
<P>__{(pleasantly)}
<D>__{fuck you, sir if i'm right, i don't need you. what i want is if i make an honest mistake i want help.}
<A>__{the commissioner nods presses a button and the window goes up to keep the air conditioning in and the heat out.}
