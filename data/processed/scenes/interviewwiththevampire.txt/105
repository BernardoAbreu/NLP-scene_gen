<L>__{interior theatre box night}
<A>__{claudia and louis look at the crowd as the lights go down.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{mortals, mortals everywhere. and lots of drops to drink.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{they are here. i know they are. listen for something that doesn't make a sound.}
<A>__{stage: curtain rises. an elaborate painted set of an italianate castle. death standing before it, the traditional image of the grim reaper, complete with magnificent scythe.}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{it's a vampire. it's the one i saw in rue st jacques.}
<A>__{a version of the poe story unfolds before them. all of the participants are vampires. all beautiful gleaming white, aged 20 or 30.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{they use no painterior and the audience think it is painterior}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{how devilishly clever.}
<A>__{a spotlight uncovers a mortal woman suddenly forced out upon the stage.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{she's no vampire.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{no. she's frightened. she doesn't know where she is.}
<A>__{the audience laughs uneasily, then stops as the mortal woman comes into the footlights. she is too beautiful, too confused. santiago, as death, advances on her. she backs away, terrified, then sees the other vampires, in a phalanx, advancing from behind, in a half circle.}
<C>__{mortal woman}
<D>__{i don't want to die!}
<A>__{she looks around in panic. santiago swoons, arms over his breast as if he is hopelessly in love.}
<C>__{santiago}
<D>__{we are death!}
<A>__{the mortal woman steps to the footlights.}
<C>__{mortal woman}
<D>__{someone help me. please... what have i done?}
<A>__{louis whispers to claudia.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{this is no performance.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{and no one knows but us...}
<B>__{on the stage}
<C>__{santiago}
<D>__{we all die. death is the one thing you share with all those here.}
<A>__{santiago gestures to the audience.}
<B>__{audience}
<A>__{rapt faces.}
<B>__{on the stage}
<C>__{mortal woman}
<D>__{but i'm young...}
<C>__{santiago}
<D>__{death is no respecter of age. he can come any time, any place. need i tell you what fate has in store for you?}
<C>__{mortal woman}
<D>__{i would take my chance. let me go! please...}
<C>__{santiago}
<D>__{and if you take that chance and live, what is your fate? the humpbacked toothless visage of old age?}
<A>__{santiago approaches her and tears the drawstring out of her peasant blouse. it opens completely and starts to slip. she tries to catch it, but gently stops her wrists. the blouse falls, exposing her young breasts.}
<B>__{louis and claudia}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{this is monstrous!}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{yes, and very beautiful.}
<B>__{on the stage}
<C>__{santiago}
<D>__{just as this flesh is pink now, it will turn grey and wrinkle with age.}
<C>__{mortal woman}
<D>__{let me live, please. i don't care.}
<C>__{santiago}
<D>__{then why should you care if you die now?}
<A>__{she shakes her head, confused. he catches her wrists behind her back.}
<B>__{audience}
<A>__{is awestruck by her beauty, her suffering.}
<B>__{santiago}
<A>__{draws near her cheek.}
<C>__{santiago}
<D>__{and suppose death had a heart to love and to release you? to whom would he turn his passion? would you pick a person from the crowd there? a person to suffer as you suffer?}
<B>__{audience}
<A>__{a young girl cries out in jest.}
<C>__{young girl}
<D>__{oh, yes, take me monsieur vampire! i adore you!}
<A>__{audience roars with laughter.}
<B>__{on the stage}
<C>__{santiago}
<D>__{you wait your turn.}
<A>__{the audience laughs again. the mortal woman shakes her head in panic.}
<C>__{santiago}
<D>__{well, have you a sister, a mother, a daughter you would send in your place?}
<B>__{close on claudia}
<A>__{even she is repelled by the cruelty. she shakes her head.}
<B>__{mortal woman}
<A>__{shakes her head. she is helpless.}
<C>__{santiago}
<D>__{we alone can give death meaning. do you know what it means to be loved by death, to become our bride?}
<A>__{mortal woman looks up on the verge of hysteria or fainting. but then her eyes mist over. she is being entranced.}
<B>__{from her pov}
<A>__{we realize she is looking past santiago at the divinely beautiful armand, who has just stepped out of the wings. armand has entranced her. he passes santiago. santiago stiffens, but yields the stage.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{no pain.}
<C>__{mortal woman}
<D>__{no pain?}
<A>__{armand takes her by the naked shoulders.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{your beauty is a gift to us.}
<B>__{on the stage}
<A>__{armand gestures to the others who slowly, gracefully close in.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{who deserves such a gift?}
<A>__{he pulls the drawstring from her skirt and it falls revealing her nakedness. but she is spellbound.}
<C>__{mortal woman}
<D>__{no pain...}
<A>__{armand embraces her, drinks, her naked body stark against her black clothes, then he passes her to the other vampires one by one.}
<B>__{close on louis}
<A>__{who battles desire and hunger with anger.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i've seen enough of this! i loathe it!}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{be still!}
<B>__{on the stage}
<A>__{the naked mortal woman lies dead on the floor. the vampires seem to vanish one by one. as the curtain draws across, the audience loudly applauds what they presume are theatrical tricks.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{the audience, milling towards the exits. they talk in vacuous terms about the beauty of the show, the symbolism of it, the daring of it as they leave. gradually louis and claudia are left alone in the empty theatre. louis seems anxious to leave. claudia whispers in his ear.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{patience, louis. patience.}
<A>__{he looks around the empty theatre, more eerie now than when the play was on. the red curtain shifts slightly in a hidden breeze, a candle sputters and dies in a box. then the candle flares again, and we see armand in the box, looking down on them. he stares with a dreamy expression, saying nothing.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{we've been searching for you for a very long time...}
<A>__{his voice echoes eerily. armand gestures for them to follow him.}
