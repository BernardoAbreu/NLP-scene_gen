<D>__{drink this and stop being silly. why would anyone want to live in this place. you might as well be dead and buried. nothing to do but look at mountains. in a week you'd be talking to yourself.}
<P>__{(then, brightly)}
<D>__{maybe that's what got you started in the first place.}
<A>__{elaine pushes the cup away, sits up straighter.}
<C>__{elaine}
