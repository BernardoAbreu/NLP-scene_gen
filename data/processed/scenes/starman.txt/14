<L>__{interior finished house (bedroom) night}
<A>__{we are looking at the back of the humanoid figure. it crosses to a high window and looks out. the reddish tinge of the fog outlines him.}
<L>__{exterior housing tract night}
<A>__{the men strain to see something through the silent fog.}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{you see anything, mike?}
<A>__{before mike can answer, a strange percussive clicking sound is heard. he pumps a shell in the chamber of his shotgun and swallowing his fear moves toward the voices. they stop.}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{this is the police. identify yourselves.}
<A>__{benny, his flashlight throwing a feeble beam in front of him, inches around the house looking for what he shot at. he gets to where it should be but it's not there. his light searches the area. there is nothing but a stack of lumber. shaking visibly he shuffles to it and peers around its corner. nothing. benny relaxes and allows himself to breathe again.}
<C>__{benny}
<P>__{(shouts to the officers)}
<D>__{you wanna give me some help over here.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{okay...}
<A>__{benny continues around the house. he flashes his light into a doorway. there is nothing but framing. when he moves on, a figure steps out of the darkness to fill the space, then raises its arms. with a sharp snap cylindrical devices swing off its wrist into its hands. at the corner of the house benny hears the snap and stops. the high pitched whistle starts behind him. he stumbles around to face a brilliant white light flying directly at him. benny screams in terror and fires at it. the light swerves and a laser streak from one of the hand rockets sears benny's chest and knocks him to the ground in pain. holding his shoulder he watches the light rise and fall erratically between the houses. the officers watch in awe as the beam wobbles through the air, then crashes to the earth.}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{mike, call for back up.}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{benny, you all right?}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{i don't think so...}
<P>__{(clutching his shoulder)}
<C>__{officer}
<P>__{(waving the beam of his flashlight, shouts)}
<D>__{benny, this is me. i'm going to take a look.}
<A>__{benny's beam flashes back.}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{don't leave me. i'm coming.}
<A>__{the two men begin to trot toward the light. it swings wildly around and, accompanied by the high pitched whistle, starts to stagger back up the hill. benny and the officer break into a run. they are on their way up the hill when the light in front of them crashes to the earth. it rolls over and lays still, the beam shooting straight up into the air. benny and the officer slow their pursuit, terrified of what they might find. suddenly a high pitched whistle is bearing down on them from behind. before they can turn a light rockets over their heads. with a rumble the hill begins to vibrate. as they follow its flight, they see lights beginning to ripple to life across the skin of a saucer shaped spacecraft resting at the edge of the forest on top of the hill. with a rumble the hill begins to vibrate. frightened, the officers stop.}
