<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{kathy, think about what you're saying...}
<A>__{kathy raises the glasses to her face...}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{... there's no such thing as }
<A>__{... revealing a face from hell before her the jackal.}
<B>__{through ghost glasses}
<A>__{with unnaturally long limbs and fingers with long, jagged nails; its sloping head and bulging eyes contained in the cage it wears on his head, the jackal stands before kathy in a shredded straitjacket, half torn off, half burned away. he supplies a madman's grin, saliva dripping, baring unnaturally large, crooked teeth, and then suddenly, when a heartbeat can seem like an eternity, he leaps at kathy as if shot out of a shotgun.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{kathy screams as she's literally propelled down the hall. arthur's pov at the end of the corridor, kathy is seen being dragged invisibly across the floor, pinned to the wall, then dragged up it to the ceiling.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{daddy! help me!! oh god!!}
<A>__{her clothes are shredded from her body.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{arthur, running }
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{kathy!?}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{daddy, help me!}
<A>__{arthur, without glasses, can't see the jackal, but he can see the impossible spectacle of an invisible something savagely tearing his daughter apart.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{kathy! what is it? i can't see a thing!}
<A>__{arthur grabs kathy, tries to drag her away. but the jackal won't let go. kathy is hoisted in the air between the two, a tug of war that's killing her. arthur won't let go of her hands and the invisible jackal won't let go of her feet. bloody scratches rip open along her legs as her clothes are ripped to shreds.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{make it let go! make it let go!}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{where is it?! kathy, tell me where it is }
<A>__{arthur grabs all the material he can and pulls. it tears. kathy rebounds, almost falling. the jackal leaps on her like a hellish animal, scratching her with both fingers and toes. she screams over and over. arthur sees bloody scratches appear on kathy's skin, deep, red, sharp.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{jesus christ, get off! get off!}
<A>__{hysterical, arthur finally pulls kathy up and drags her down the passage. the jackal leaps again, yanking her from arthur's grasp. arthur barely catches hold of kathy's arm and pulls. but the jackal's too strong... and he's losing her... suddenly, the corridor lights up behind him, and a phosphorous flare is tossed to the floor beside him. the jackal shrieks with unearthly horror! a second set of hands grabs hold of kathy and pulls alongside arthur. arthur turns and comes face to face with kalina, knapsack slung over her shoulder, glasses on her face. he does a double take, then }
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{who the hell're you?}
<C>__{kalina}
<D>__{pull!!}
<A>__{together, the two pull kathy down the hall, away from the jackal. the jackal regains his wits and attacks. it's a race now.}
<C>__{kalina}
<D>__{run, goddammit!!!}
<A>__{arthur and kalina drag kathy down the hall, trying to outrun the jackal. kathy's pov (upside down going backwards) the thing gives chase, closing the gap in the blink of an eye.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{hurry, daddy!!}
<A>__{at the last possible moment, the jackal leaps. kathy screams again. the jackal suddenly slams into an invisible barrier. kathy reacts with astonishment as the ghost rips and tears into the barrier like a wild animal trying to get at meat... sparks fly. the trio tries to regain themselves around the corner. kathy's in arthur's arms, cut, bruised, crying. he looks up with fire in his eyes at kalina }
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{just who the hell are you, how the hell did you get in here, and what the hell was that!?}
