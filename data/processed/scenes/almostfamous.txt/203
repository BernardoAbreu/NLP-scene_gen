<L>__{interior breakfast table day}
<A>__{a quiet kitchen. anita has been cooking. a substantial breakfast has been placed on the table. sausage, orange juice... and now anita sets down a plate of pancakes, with syrup and butter, in front of her mother. william watches his mother facing an old enemy white sugar.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{they're called pancakes. who knows when we'll be together again. splurge. it's what most people call breakfast.}
<A>__{mom looks at her children, and takes a breath.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{i went through your records. and i found a song to play for you.}
<A>__{she goes to the stereo and puts on a record. the two children eye each other what's coming next? (song to be chosen) the two kids eye each other again. self consciously avoiding their gaze, mom sits and toys with her breakfast. it's a song she clearly wants them to hear. it's a song from the heart. they look at her, amazed. elaine looks up, regards her family. somehow they're back at this table. they continue eating breakfast.}
<B>__{on sidewalk}
<A>__{bam. a bundle of bound rolling stone magazines lands on the newsstand pavement with a thud. someone reaches in to cut the cord, as the magazines puff up into view. it's the new issue, with russell hammond on the cover. the title: stillwater runs deep. just another stack of magazines waiting to be places in the racks.}
