<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior laundromat day}
<A>__{there are only a few customers sitting around, waiting for their wash. a bum is stretched out on his back across one of the tables like a corpse awaiting autopsy. this is cheater. a maintenance man in grey work clothes enters from the back. he opens a broom closet, takes out a bucket and mop and rolls them toward the front of the laundromat. he stops at cheater's table and shakes him hard.}
<C>__{maintenance man}
<D>__{okay, man, move it out. let's go.}
<C>__{cheater}
<D>__{wha ?}
<A>__{cheater sits up and starts to pull himself together. an old woman sitting against the wall points down one of the aisles of washing machines and says to the maintenance man:}
<C>__{old woman}
<D>__{there's another one down there.}
<A>__{the maintenance man goes to the end of the aisle and looks down into the nook created by the absence of one of the washing machines.}
<C>__{maintenance man}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{he nudges at whatever's inside the nook with his foot.}
<C>__{maintenance man}
<P>__{(nudging again)}
<D>__{come on, bright eyes. wake up. wake jesus christ! what happened to you?}
<B>__{angle on nook}
<A>__{as curt duncan raises his head into the light and looks up at the maintenance man. overnight, his face has swollen considerably and a bright yellow and purple discoloring around his bruises has emerged.}
<C>__{maintenance man }
<D>__{you get hit by a truck or what?}
<A>__{he bends over and helps pull duncan to his feet.}
<B>__{wider angle}
<A>__{as the maintenance man guides duncan to the door.}
<C>__{maintenance man}
<D>__{i'm sorry, man, but you can't stay in here. go out to the park, lay in the sunshine. you'll feel better. okay?}
<A>__{duncan goes out the door. the maintenance man turns and sees cheater stretched out again on the table.}
<C>__{maintenance man}
<D>__{god bless it! hey!}
<A>__{he pulls cheater off the table and pushes him to the door.}
<C>__{maintenance man}
<D>__{out. out. out. out. out.}
