<L>__{exterior porch grady's house night (a bit later)}
<A>__{grady sits quietly on the porch steps, a joint burning in his fingers. to his left, perched atop a haagen dazs container, is a telephone. as he pulls it into his lap, a lamp in the living room pirouettes clumsily, spins free of the cord, and shatters on the floor. grady blinks, looks away, and dials, just as. ..the clattering cough of an engine is heard and a van appears. stenciled on its side panel is: kravnik's sporting goods the van slows, almost coasting, then abruptly bursts past grady's house and disappears around the corner. grady frowns, then realizes a man's voice is coming from the receiver in his lap.}
