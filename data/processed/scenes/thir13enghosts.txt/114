<D>__{so, what're you gonna do now? your nephew believes the sacrifice is gonna stop this thing, but you'll never get him to jump into the eye, not until he finds his kids.}
<C>__{cyrus}

<P>__{(tosses her some rope)}
<D>__{go tie them up.}
<C>__{kalina}
<D>__{cyrus, i can't...}
<C>__{cyrus}
<D>__{why not? you know as well as i do that human lives are the price of human achievement. how many lives went into the construction of the pyramids? or the great wall of china? or the space program? it's darwinism at its finest.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now step aside... i need to finish setting this up. and you need to do your job...}
