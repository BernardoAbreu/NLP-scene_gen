<L>__{exterior ship day}
<A>__{there is no sign of land behind them. the ship is moving swiftly in a strong, clean breeze and a light sea. we can tell from thalia's reactions that she has never been out at sea before, at least never above deck. every thing is novel to her and it shows, even the movement of the ship. her excitement is childlike.}
<C>__{thalia}
<D>__{where's the land gone?}
<A>__{hector, too, is taken by the novelty of it all but is less prepared to admit it. he waves his hands around the empty horizon noncommittally.}
<C>__{thalia}
<D>__{have you been on a ship before?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{yes, of course.}
<A>__{we can tell he is lying.}
<C>__{thalia}
<D>__{me, too, but they kept us down there.}
<A>__{she points down into the lower depths of the hold. then she gets even more excited.}
<C>__{thalia}
<D>__{tonight... we'll be where the thunder is!}
<A>__{they look at each other and then all around them. the freshness of the day and on an overwhelming feeling of freedom, exhilarate them. their senses and their feelings, are in new territory. they are like children in a brand new world. the captain on the other side of the ship, beckons them.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{thought you would like to see them.}
<A>__{he points to three shapes in the mid distance, ships heading for the port they have left. there is a thrill in their glamor, their fine progress under full sail.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{your master's ships... going home...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{no... they can't be... they're lost...}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{no they're not... i know these ships... my brother in law's the master of the big one with the brown sail...}
<A>__{hector and thalia look at each other. the captain smiles at them and looks back to the ships, coursing healthily on their way.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{somebody been putting the wind up lucinnius? that's an old one... didn't think anybody'd fall for that...}
