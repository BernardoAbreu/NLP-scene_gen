<L>__{exterior roadside late afternoon}
<A>__{a torrential rainstorm lashes the countryside. the star man and jenny splash along the edge of the asphalt. their heads are lowered against the weather. they are both drenched to the skin.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(after a few steps)}
<D>__{we're not going to get a ride tonight.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{i can't stay on this planet.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{no one's traveling in this weather.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{you promised you would get me to my ship.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(shouts after him)}
<D>__{i will. i will. we still have another day.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{you promised.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{what do you want from me? there are no cars on this road. i didn't ask for this stupid storm.}
<A>__{the star man mutters in his language.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{what are you saying?}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{you can stop. i will go on alone.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{we're too far away to walk. don't you understand?}
<A>__{the star man looks at her. with the rain streaming off his face, he looks at her. for the first time, the reality of the situation hits him. he turns and, swearing in his own language, flails at the rain. a distance from jenny, he stops and cries out in english.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{i can't stay here. i want to go home. i don't want this skin. i don't want to look like this.}
<A>__{jenny can see him standing with his head bowed. she walks over to him.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(trying to ease his pain)}
<D>__{why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{i used the last one to jump off the cliff...}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{let's find a place out of the rain. i'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{i can't be late. i don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. i don't know if my words went to the ship. if i'm not there, the captain will think i'm dead and go.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{we'll get a ride in the morning.}
<A>__{a flash of lightning shows us:}
