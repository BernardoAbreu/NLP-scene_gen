<A>__{coins splash across the kitchen counter. curtis sets an empty coffee can back on the shelf in front of him and begins sifting through the change. odd screws, buttons, then he gets to what he's looking for. a small set of brass keys on a matching ring. he grabs the keys from the pile and exits.}

<A>__{curtis walks back out to the storm shelter, keys in hand, long flashlight in his back pocket. he pulls up the padlock that holds the two rusted doors together. popping off the rubber cover, he tries a key. the lock pops up. he unhooks it from the doors and lets it fall to the ground. curtis strains to pull the first door open. it's heavy and sticks from lack of use. finally, with a creak, the door swings back. curtis holds his head to the side, a musty odor coming from inside. he forces the second door open. curtis stands in front of the shelter, a gaping black hole angled up from the earth. he takes the flashlight from his pocket and turns it on. it illuminates concrete steps leading down. the dog, nose at the fence, watches from his pen on the other side of the yard. curtis enters the shelter.}
