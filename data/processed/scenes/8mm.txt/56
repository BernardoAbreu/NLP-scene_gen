<A>__{welles sits with the projector on, watching the film again.}
<P>__{welles (v.o., cont)}
<D>__{there were three men. two are obvious; the man in the mask and the man running the camera, but i caught a glimpse of a third man in a mirror. it's nothing that can be used for identification, but he was there, watching...}
<A>__{on the wall: masked man touches the girl's mouth, presses his lips to hers. masked man backs away, leaving frame, till the camera moves to find masked man standing at a table with three large bowie knifes laid out... welles notices something, puts the projector on freeze frame.}
<P>__{welles (v.o., cont)}
<D>__{so, there were three. they would have kept it small, wouldn't have let anyone in on it they didn't have to. that's all for now... except, i feel i should tell you... with this looking like it happened at least five or six years ago...}
<A>__{welles walks to the frozen image on the wall. it shows the masked man's hands in frame, fingering the blades.}
<P>__{welles (v.o., cont)}
<D>__{well, it's not very likely we'll ever find out who this girl was.}
<P>__{(listens)}
<D>__{i will, i will keep trying. goodbye.}
<A>__{v.o. phone call ends with the sound of the phone hanging up. on the wall: there's a dark spot on masked man's hand, on the arch between his index finger and thumb. grainy and hard to make out, but looks like a small tattoo.}
