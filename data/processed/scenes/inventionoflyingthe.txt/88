<L>__{interior mark's mansion kitchen night}
<A>__{with a beer bottle in his hand mark searches through his kitchen drawers for a bottle opener. he opens a drawer and something catches his eye. angle on: the envelope which reads, "my invention". slowly mark pulls it out of the drawer and stares at it. the sound of his front door opening startles him and mark shoves the envelope into his back pocket.}

<A>__{jennifer pulls out an invitation, mark waves it away.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i hope you'll come.}
<A>__{mark shrugs and jennifer puts the invitation back in her purse.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{no point really.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{it would make me happy. being around you makes me happy.}
<A>__{mark turns towards her.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{so don't marry him.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i only have a few years to marry someone with good genes and financial stability so i can have children and the family i've always wanted. one day i will be old and wrinkly and ugly.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{no you won't. not to me you won't. i love you. if you really love someone it doesn't matter what they look like.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{do me this favor. just one favor. don't accept everything you see. don't just do something because that's the way it's done.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{you're confusing me.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{think about what you want. find out what you really want. and if it's not the same as what i want, well then i will know that and i will never darken your doorstep again.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i want you. what do you want?}
<A>__{jennifer and mark stare at each other for a long beat.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i'm going to go.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{please don't. will you just stay a little bit longer? i don't want to be alone. just sit with me.}
<A>__{jennifer nods. mark leads her into the living room and they sit down far apart from each other on the couch. mark turns the tv on and they both sit in silence.}
<B>__{later.}
<A>__{mark has fallen asleep on the couch. jennifer checks her watch and stands up. she takes out her wedding invitation and lays it on the coffee table by mark. she unfolds a blanket and is about to place it on him when she notices an envelope sticking out of his back pocket. she pulls it out and looks at it.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{my invention.}
<A>__{she opens the letter and begins to read. once finished, she folds up the letter and hurriedly leaves, scared and confused.}
