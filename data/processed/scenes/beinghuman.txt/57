<L>__{interior farmhouse night}
<A>__{hector creeps cautiously into the dark kitchen. the figure has gone to the pantry and can be heard rummaging there. hector creeps closer and sees that it is the priest. he already has a chicken leg between his teeth as he hunts for a cup for the jar of wine tucked under his arm. he emerges from the pantry. he sees hector standing by the table. they recognize one another and relax. the priest doesn't re enter his holy act. he speaks normally, cheekily.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{god, i'm starving. do you think i dare heat that up on the fire?}
<A>__{he indicates the large pot containing the remains of the stew.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{no... i will eat it cold... i deserve to suffer.}
<A>__{he pours some wine into the cup and slides it across the table to hector. then he digs his hands into the cold stew and eats chunks of meat as they talk.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{have some wine.}
<A>__{hector takes a drink.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i saw some fighting today... back up the road...}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{so, the mad knights are at it again... what were they, swiss or english?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i don't know. they all look the same to me.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{it might help us get through... if there's a bit of confusion... we'll still travel separately though, for now.}
<A>__{the priest changes his tone of voice, mocking his own holy act.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{but, hector, you must keep out of the way of temptation... i saw the way you were eyeing up that widow... now stay away from that... although she is beautiful, is she not... but we're going home, remember.}
<A>__{hector is smiling.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{how do you know she's a widow?}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{look at her eyes... hungry eyes... she could lead you into trouble... she smells like paradise, though.}
<A>__{he changes his tone yet again. he talks straight.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{listen, hector, let's get this clear... if anyone's going to dally with that widow it'll be me... you couldn't handle her... she'd bewitch you... at any rate, you're not a sinning kind of fellow, are you... why don't you get off up the road tomorrow, and i will catch you up, in five or so days...}
<A>__{hector doesn't answer, but smiles. the priest has stirred thoughts that he had intended to dampen entirely.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{you're not a sinning fellow, remember... another month and we'll be at the channel, then home... the little ones you only talk about when you're drunk... don't forget them...}
<A>__{hector still remains silent. the priest is worried.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{why do i always talk so much... you weren't even thinking of her 'til i opened my mouth... but i trust you... don't worry. i know you wouldn't do anything to anger your god, or me. get me some bread.}
<A>__{hector obeys the priest without thought. the priest is happier now that he is in control again.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{who saved your neck in venice?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{you did, ronald.}
<A>__{hector approaches the priest with the bread.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{and don't you forget it.}
<A>__{he raises his cup to hector.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{may the lord forgive us our sins, those we have committed and those we as yet only dream of. she's a glory of a woman.}
<A>__{for all his wit and endless talk we can sense a trace of vulnerabililty in ronald. for all his bluster, there is the feeling that he needs hector as much as he claims hector needs him.}
