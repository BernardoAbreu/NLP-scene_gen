<L>__{interior ed punch's office day}
<A>__{...ed punch, managing editor, looks up from a reverie with a startled expression. he wears really thick glasses which magnify his eyes, giving him a frightening aspect.}
<C>__{punch}
<D>__{quoyle? you're early.}
<A>__{from the rear, we see quoyle can barely squeeze himself into the chair.}
<C>__{punch}
<D>__{i don't like that.}
<A>__{all the change spills out of quoyle's pockets, and clatters onto the wood floor, rolling interminably, as quoyle fidgets.}
<C>__{punch}
<D>__{partridge says you're not as dumb as you look.}
<A>__{reverse angle now to see quoyle's face. the neat moustache of powdered sugar.}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{how could i be?}
<A>__{and takes a healthy bite from what's left of the doughnut.}
<C>__{punch}
<D>__{anyway, that's why i'm takin' a chance on you. partridge said he'd re write whatever of your stuff. stay late...}
<A>__{quoyle nods, dumbly. knows this.}
<C>__{punch}
<D>__{we're a family paper. upbeat stories with a community slant. self help stuff: are you a break fast alcoholic?...guide to getting dumped...like that.}
<A>__{quoyle nods bigger. like he gets it. punch shoves an antique tape recorder across the table.}
<C>__{punch}
<D>__{city planning board meeting at two thirty. three hunnerd words max. sink or swim.}
<A>__{hold on quoyle's eyes. recalling... flashback: exterior public pool day ...quoyle as a fat kid in a baggy bathing suit, being savagely pummeled by his vicious older brother...}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{i think my brother said that once.}
<C>__{brother}
<D>__{lardass! snotface! fartbag!}
<A>__{being pulled off the sniveling quoyle by a rough hairy man with dead eyes.}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{maybe it was my father.}
<A>__{quoyle's father hauls him off the deck, and in a single motion, flings him into the pool!}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{sink or swim, pig butt.}
<A>__{watches the thrashing with mild contempt. turns away before quoyle simply sinks beneath the surface.}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{i'm not a water person.}
