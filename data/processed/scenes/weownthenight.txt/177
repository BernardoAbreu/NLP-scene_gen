<A>__{cars. the police are assembled around: marat buzhayev. bobby watches him for a moment, his face filled with controlled rage. beat. each man stares at each other. then:}
<C>__{marat buzhayev}
<D>__{bobby i, i didn't know it would be your family }
<A>__{bobby takes a threatening step forward. bobby's expression seems unmatched in its ferocity; marat sees in bobby's eyes a horrible determination, begins to cry... bobby's emotions are a cauldron:}

<D>__{get down! on the ground!}
<A>__{marat gets on his knees. whimpering. bobby puts marat's hands on his head, starts patting him down. clean. bobby puts the shotgun at marat's temple. we hear the dogs, the fire, the wind, the sirens... the police see the unforgiving expression on bobby's face and the reality of the old man in front of them. bobby turns to the others, particularly jack. he looks at him, dark eyed. then he turns away and starts walking, making eye contact with none of them. he utters a command, to all of them and none of them in particular:}

<D>__{put him in the fuckin' van... don't touch him...}
<A>__{bobby walks past the small building, which continues to burn silently with that eerie blue flame... other cops watch him with awe and respect. they back away from him. he proceeds on toward the cars. he sees: joseph inside one of them, still. staring at him. we dolly with him as he moves to his brother. crouches down, stays by joseph... close shot of an announcement board, surrounded by flowers: "one p.m.: n.y.p.d. event academy graduation."}
