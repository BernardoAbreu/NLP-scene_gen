<L>__{exterior jade palace night}
<A>__{tigress stands in the moonlight outside the palace. she has seen what just transpired between shifu and po. she turns away, a look of resolve on her face... and leaps. she flies through the air, finally landing on a rooftop in the valley below. she looks back up at the palace.}
<C>__{tigress}
<D>__{this is what you trained me for.}
<A>__{she takes off running. the other four are right behind her.}
<C>__{viper}
<D>__{tigress!}
<A>__{she keeps going and they give chase.}
<C>__{tigress}
<D>__{don't try and stop me!}
<A>__{the chase continues through the village.}
<C>__{viper}
<D>__{we're not trying to stop you!}
<C>__{tigress}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{viper}
<D>__{we're coming with you!}
<A>__{then...the others join her. tigress smiles. they leap off into the night.}
