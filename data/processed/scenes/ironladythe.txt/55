<L>__{interviewer }
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{oh that's rather easy to answer, actually. they are unafraid of success.}
<L>__{interior reece's office. london. 1975. day}
<A>__{margaret is watching the same interview on a tv monitor. she is watching herself intently, as are reece and airey neave. they are polar opposites, reece flamboyant to neave's bluff. she sounds very plummy, like a conservative party wife from the shires. and she wears a hat.}
<C>__{margaret on television}
<D>__{we in great britain and in europe are formed mainly by our history. they on the other hand are formed by their philosophy. not by what has been, but by what can be. oh, we have a great deal that we can learn from them, yes. oh yes!}
<A>__{margaret is trapped in the moment but the two men exchange a glance. neave freezes the picture. margaret smiles uneasily, like someone expecting a compliment. reece considers her, long and hard. it is a little unsettling until }
<C>__{reece}
<D>__{well er...for a start, that hat has got to go. and the pearls. in fact i think all hats may have to go. you look and sound like a privileged conservative wife and we've already got her vote. you've got lovely hair but we need to do something with it to make it more }
<C>__{airey neave}
<D>__{important.}
<C>__{reece}
<D>__{yes. give it more impact. but the main thing is your voice. its too high. it has no authority.}
<C>__{airey neave}
<D>__{methinks the lady doth screech too much}
<C>__{reece}
<D>__{people don't want to be harangued by a woman or hectored. persuaded yes. that `oh yes' at the end of the interview, that's authoritative, that's the voice of a leader.}
<A>__{margaret stares at him.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{it's all very well to talk about changing my voice, mr reece, but for some of my colleagues to imagine me as their leader would be like imagining, i don't know, being led into battle by their chambermaid. it's my background, and my sex. no matter how i've tried, and i have tried, to fit in, i will never be truly one of them.}
<A>__{both reece and neave are aware that she has spoken very nakedly and is thus extremely vulnerable.}
<C>__{reece}
<D>__{if i may say so i think that's your trump card. you're flying in the face of everything the tories have been thus far. it's really very exciting. one simply has to maximise your appeal, bring out all your qualities and make you look, and sound, like the leader that you could be.}
<C>__{neave}
<D>__{you've got it in you to go the whole distance.}
<C>__{reece}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{prime minister?! oh no. oh no no no. in britain? there will be no female prime minister here, not in my lifetime. no. and i told airey, i don't expect to win the leadership, but i am going to run. just to shake up the party.}
<A>__{neave moves in intently }
<C>__{neave}
<D>__{respectfully, margaret, i disagree. if you want to change this party, lead it. if you want to change the country, lead it. what we're talking about here today is surface. what's crucial is that you hold your course, and stay true to who you are. never be anything other than yourself.}
<A>__{margaret, though flattered, looks sceptical.}
<C>__{reece}
<D>__{leave us to do the rest.}
<B>__{a beat}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{gentlemen, i am in your hands. i may be persuaded to surrender the hat. but the pearls were a gift from my husband on the birth of our twins and they are absolutely non negotiable.}
<A>__{margaret smiles at them.}
