<A>__{billy lies on his bunk at night deeply depressed, paler. candlelight flutters softly against the stone walls. a photo of susan taken outdoors with a mountain range in the background, is on his wall with various soap carvings of little chess piece she has designed. in the distance, very faintly coming upwards into our sound consciousness we hear a train whistling in the night, on an old railroad track bypassing the prison walls. two whistles. chugging. then passing off. the midnight express.}

<D>__{dear susan. 1970 has now passed into 1971. you can drift in here and never know you're gone. you can fade so far out and you don't know where you are anymore or where anything else is...}

<D>__{i find loneliness is a physical pain which hurts all over; you can't isolate it in one part of your body. i so much need your softness, your strength. i have your letters. they charge me, give me courage.news about amnesty and getting out tangled, complicated...}

<D>__{...i feel myself drifting more heavily into smoking hashish. the haze helps the time pass. also i do soap carvings. erich taught me. and i have been learning turkish because it helps me to deal with the guards and the prisoners. i'm trying hard to maintain some sort of schedule to my life, but sometimes it seems like i'm just trying in order to try...}
<A>__{ziat is evidently awake he pulls his radio over into the bed, and peering around to make sure no one is watching, here moves the screws from the back of it, pulls off the cover and puts in a sheaf of large denomination german marks: inside we briefly glimpse a wad of different colored currencies stacked with rubber bands.}
