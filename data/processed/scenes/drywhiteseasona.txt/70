<L>__{interior interrogation room (john vorster square) day}
<A>__{gordon is undoing his trousers. venter roughly drops the trousers and pushing him to the floor. he handcuffs him while johannes pulls off the trousers and underpants, and manacles his ankles. johannes fetches a rod. venter goes to a cupboard, pulls out two electric wires with electrodes attachments and places them on the desk. all the preparation is done with practiced efficiency. from the adjoining room there are angry shouts of a woman. venter and johannes place the rod between gordon's elbow joints and the back of his knees. the door opens. gordon has a look of terror on his face.}
