<L>__{interior whitaker farm living room night}
<A>__{smokey robinson and the miracles' "you really got a hold on me" plays as whip eases himself into a recliner using his cane. on the small table next to him rests his beer and an unopened bottle of bourbon with a glass of ice. whip cracks the seal on the bourbon bottle and pours a drink. he takes a sip and chases it with his beer. whip now starts to remove the brace that we clearly see under his basketball shorts. as he takes it off he tries to massage his aching leg. nicole enters the living room, fresh from a shower. whip studies her she's beautiful and innocent.}

<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{i was gonna lay down, get some rest.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{okay. whip takes another sip before returning to massaging his leg.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{is it really okay that i stay here?}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{yea. i want you to stay. nicole walks over to whip and kneels down and gently takes over massaging his leg. whip exhales.}
<C>__{whip }
<D>__{that feels better.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{it's throbbing because the blood is having a hard time getting back to your heart.}
<A>__{nicole continues to soothe his aching leg. after a moment, nicole stands and takes the drink out of whip's hand and sets it down. she now bends down and kisses him softly. she now stands and takes his hand, leading him in to the bedroom.}
