<L>__{interior kitchen night}
<A>__{nicki is sitting with her head in her hands at the kitchen table, sobbing. there's a nearly empty bottle beside her. frank is instantly on the alert but makes no sign.}

<P>__{(crying)}
<D>__{i was an idiot last night.}
<A>__{there is a long pause.}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{what do you think about today?}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{i think this is no maniac. he knows what he's doing.}
<A>__{there is a long, long silence. nicki continues crying. finally }
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{you're right. he does.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{tell me about it.}
<A>__{she doesn't reply.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{who is it, nicki?}

<D>__{...my darling fletcher...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{who is it?}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{i don't know. i don't know.}
<A>__{frank goes to her, treats her gently, like a doctor.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you can call him off.}
<C>__{nicki}
<P>__{(shaking her head)}
<D>__{he doesn't even know who hired him. he doesn't know who i am and i don't know who he is.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{how'd you do it?}
<A>__{she seems on the edge of hysteria. frank takes her face in his hands, strokes her hair, brings her back from the brink.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{...i went to a bar in east l.a. i asked around... i talked to a man...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{name?}
<C>__{nicki}
<P>__{(vague)}
<D>__{...armando... he arranged it. that's all i know...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{is it all paid for?}
<C>__{nicki}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{... and then some... till it's done.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{he keeps going until he kills her?}
<A>__{nicki nods again, lowering her face into her hands.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what's the name of the bar?}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{i'm not sure... i was very stoned.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{how 'bout the letters?}
<C>__{nicki}
<P>__{(desperately)}
<D>__{no, no. you don't understand. the letters came first. i don't know who's sending them... but they're reading my mind... those were my thoughts. i hate her. it made me think i could do it... but i could never hurt fletcher. never.}
<P>__{(begging him)}
<D>__{you've got to stop it!}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{we will. you and me. tomorrow we're going back to l.a. we're going to find the bar, we're going to find armando.}
<A>__{he starts to rise. she stops him.}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{don't you even want to know why?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you told me. she has everything.}
<A>__{frank stands up and begins to move across the room. nicki puts her face in her hands and is silent for one moment. suddenly, frank freezes, listening.}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{what if we can't }
<A>__{frank motions her into silence. we strain to hear what frank hears. silently, frank goes to the door, crouch ing. he listens. there again is a distant growl from the dog upstairs. frank lifts his gun from the table, turns to nicki.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{stay here. don't move.}
<A>__{nicki's face shows true terror. frank is out the door.}
