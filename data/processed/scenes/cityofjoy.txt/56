<L>__{interior godfather's house day}
<A>__{at first all we see are feet on a marble floor. the goonda's in his running shoes, then ram and hasari's bare feet. this is the partitioned splendor of an old house sprinkled with the relics of a grand colonial past. everything is baroque, rotting and somehow impressive. hasari has never been anywhere like this, and is caught between curiosity and fear of breathing.}
<L>__{interior "throne room"}
<A>__{the three men enter a large room shuttered from the sun light dusty and packed with a ramshackle assortment of furniture. two fat blue titmice perch in a cage next to ambitious plaster portrait of napolean. sitting behind a desk is ashoka, leaning over a mirror, squeezing a balky pimple. near a large window, his 60 year old father, ghatak, in a european jacket and dhoti, works with intense concen tration at repairing a pair of broken glasses with a twist of fine wire. the three new arrivals stand silent and respectful before the desk. at last, without raising his head...}
<C>__{ashoka}
<D>__{not a tongue between you then?}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{yes, yes, i am wondering, sir, we are, is it possible you might have something for my friend?}
<A>__{ram indicates hasari, as if there might be some question to whom he's referring. ashoka attacks the pimple.}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{let me explain it for your ears, sir. my cousin from bihar has just arrived in our city }
<C>__{goonda}
<D>__{they've brought a small present of respect.}
<A>__{the goonda places a small bundle of rupees on the desk. ashoka allows himself a disinterested glance at hasari.}
<C>__{ashoka}
<D>__{so, you want to be a human horse?}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{oh yes! i have personally witnessed his excellence yes.}
<C>__{ashoka}
<D>__{he doesn't talk? can he neigh at least?}
<P>__{(to hasari)}
<D>__{you do your ears function?}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{oh yes, babu. can i... uhm...?}
<C>__{ashoka}
<D>__{neigh! like a horse.}
<A>__{ashoka pulls back his lips, shows his teeth and imitates a neigh: "ne igh! ne igh!"}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{well, yes, babu, i can do that. would you like me to imitate a horse?}
<A>__{finished with the pimple, ashoka wipes a finger on his shirt and takes a helping off a plate of sweetcakes as...}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{behind him, the godfather walks up to the desk, putting his glasses on. he barely glances at his son, but waves him out of the chair. ashoka doesn't like it, but he steps aside. as he does, he turns a look of hatred on hasari. through no fault of his own, hasari has made an enemy. ghatak chews on a pan and casts a benevolent eye on hasari.}
<C>__{ghatak}
<D>__{lift your longhi.}
<A>__{hasari does. the godfather looks at his legs and thighs.}
<C>__{ghatak}
<D>__{the wise men of our nation say that nirvana is the attainment of a state of supreme detachment. for me, nirvana is counting each evening, one by one, the rupees earned by my two thousand and forty six rickshaws.}
<A>__{hasari doesn't know whether to respond. a glance at ram tells him not to. ghatak gestures for hasari to lower his longhi.}
<C>__{ghatak}
<D>__{you are with family?}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{i have a wife and three children, babu.}
<C>__{ghatak}
<D>__{and they must eat, heh. the world is full of open mouths.}
<A>__{he chews on this a moment, then opens a drawer... and holds a small, tinkling rickshaw bell toward hasari. hasari understands that, incredibly, he has a job. his breath is so shallow, he can barely utter his gratitude. he takes the bell.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{i shall be eternally grateful to you. from now on, i shall be as the youngest of your brothers.}
<C>__{ghatak}
<D>__{stay loyal. these days, it's a crop nobody plants.}
<A>__{the godfather turns his beatific and godlike smile on hasari pal.}
