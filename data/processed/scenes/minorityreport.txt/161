<A>__{rose sits up in bed silently watching lisa and anderson together. lisa needs to touch him. she keeps a hand on his arm, brushes back a loose look of his hair. rose is mesmerized by her actions. she drinks in everything, every bit of life. anderson and lisa are deep in conversation. they speak to each other as if rose were hardly present in the room. anderson is trying to process everything lisa has told him.}

<D>__{two discs. one fake. one real.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i don't think there were supposed to be two. whoever planned it, wasn't counting on two.}

<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{an infallible system. every disc ever generated has been true ...}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{somebody wants you out of the way so they make a fake disc. who ever doubts the discs? anderson i never doubted it. i saw it. and believed it, absolutely. i was certain i was going to murder witwer.}

<A>__{anderson and lisa turn and look at rose. she lies curled on the bed, her face to the wall.}
<C>__{anderson }
<D>__{rose. if all this is based on a lie the fake disc then do i really kill witwer?}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we see what we see. i'm sorry, anderson. it's been predicted.}
