<L>__{interior james's car day}
<A>__{james is driving helen remington away from the police pound.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{you haven't told me where we're going.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{haven't i? to the airport, if you could.}
<A>__{at these words, james is stricken by an odd feeling of loss.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{the airport? why? are you leaving?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{not yet though not soon enough for some people, i've already found. a death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{i take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i will wear a bloody kimono if i want to.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{so why the airport?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i work in the immigration department there.}
<A>__{james is very aware that, as they speak, helen is intently watching his hands and feet operating the controls of the car, perceiving these motions in a way that she never would have before her crash with him. he, in turn, has trouble taking his eyes off her facial scars, which she now makes no attempt to hide. she pulls a cigarette packet from the pocket of her raincoat. she searches the instrument panel for the lighter, her right hand hovering above his knees like a nervous bird. having found the lighter, her strong hands tear away the cellophane from the cigarette pack.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{do you want a cigarette? i started to smoke at the hospital. it's rather stupid of me.}
<C>__{james}
<P>__{(suddenly very agitated)}
<D>__{look at all this traffic. i'm not sure i can deal with it.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{it's much worse now. you noticed that, did you? the day i left the hospital i had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason i didn't understand. there seemed to be ten times as much traffic.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{are we imagining it?}
<A>__{helen waves her cigarette in a gesture that takes in the whole interior of the car.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{you've bought yourself exactly the same car again. it's the same shape and colour.}
