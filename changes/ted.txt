Ted dodges again, and scrambles up John's head, jumping up and grabbing the chain on the ceiling fan, turning it on, and causing Ted to swing back and forth. John pulls free, and stumbles backward off the bed. He notices a tall, free-standing lamp in the corner. He pulls the plug out of the wall, and uses the lamp to take a swing at Ted. Ted swings out of the way. John takes a second swing, but the lamp cord catches on the fan's motor. The lamp is ripped from John's grasp, it swings around through the air, and cracks him in the side of the head. John goes down, whacking his head a second time on the baseboard of the bed. He howls in pain as he lies on his stomach, clutching his head. Ted takes advantage of this. He jumps down from the cord, and pulls the antenna off the clock radio next to the bed. He jumps down to the floor, yanks John's pants partway down, and starts whipping his bare ass with the antenna. John yells in fury, and kicks blindly at Ted. He turns over, kicking ted in the face, and kicking the cabinet that the TV is on. The TV wobbles, and falls off the cabinet, landing with a crash, right on his groin. John lies there, with the TV on his crotch and his pants down, and breathes heavily. Ted, still dazed from the kick to the face, crawls over to him. Both breathe heavily. John's breathing deteriorates into sobs.}
