<L>__{interior apartment building day}
<A>__{amy walks past the lobby and up the stairs.}
<L>__{interior the second floor day}
<A>__{amy makes her way down the narrow dark hallway and finds the appropriate door. she knocks at it. no answer. she looks down and sees a lone fly crawl out from under the door. then another follows, and another. she kneels down to inspect it. she leans forward and sniffs. the results are inconclusive. then she lays herself flat down on the floor, presses her nose up against the bottom of the door and sniffs. the smell of dead wretched air is overwhelming. and that's when a large worn shoe steps into frame right in front of amy.}
<C>__{manager }
<P>__{(irritated, with appropriate accent)}
<D>__{have you lost something?}
<A>__{amy leaps up in one quick move to find herself face to face with the manager, an older man who's a little winded from his climb up here. between his teeth he clenches a half chewed, three quarter smoked cigar. the smoke seeps through his yellowed teeth.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{yes, i ah.....}
<A>__{she pats her pockets. then tries another tactic.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{no. i'm looking for my sister. marla chen.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{you're not chinese.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{she's my half sister. same mom. different dads. i haven't heard from her in two weeks so i got nervous.}
<A>__{the manager stares at her in disbelief. knows she's up to something. amy sniffs the air coming from the room again.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{does it always smell like this in here?}
<A>__{the manager blows a bloom of smoke out of his nostrils. he yanks the cigar from his mouth and sniffs. doesn't seem that bad to him.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{look. marla is a friend of mine and she's missing.}
<A>__{my pulls a few american bills from her pocket.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i need five minutes in there. then i will know what i need to know.}
<A>__{the manager stares at the money for a beat, then stares back at amy. he bites down on his cigar and snatches it out of her hand.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{five minutes.}
<A>__{he pulls out his ring of keys and unlocks the door. amy enters. the place is dark and cold. eerily quiet. the manager stays in the hallway, he looks at amy and taps his watch. amy nods as he pulls the door closed. she descends down the dark hallway. her face tightens as she takes in the deathly ripe air. the buzzing of flies getting louder with each step. as she approaches a room, she recoils, clutching her face from the stench. she inhales drawing in the smell to acclimate herself and almost vomits. she steadies herself, drawing in breaths through her nose, tentative at first, and finally in larger breaths, until she can tolerate it. he looks back toward the entry door, she is alone.}
