<L>__{interior cloud city corridor}
<A>__{the group has crossed the narrow bridge and entered the city. they walk down the lovely art deco passageway, rounding several corners and passing many small plazas as they go. threepio lags a bit behind.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{how's the gas mine? is it paying off for you?}
<C>__{lando}
<D>__{oh, not as well as i'd like. we're a small outpost and not very self sufficient. and i've had supply problems of every kind. i've had labor difficulties...}
<P>__{(catches han grinning at him)}
<D>__{what's so funny?}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{you. listen to you you sound like a businessman, a responsible leader. who'd have thought that, huh?}
<A>__{lando is reflective. he looks at han a moment.}
<C>__{lando}
<D>__{you know, seeing you sure brings back a few things.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{lando}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{yeah. i'm responsible these days. it's the price you pay for being successful.}
<A>__{han and lando laugh together, and the group moves on through the corridor. the lagging threepio passes a threepio type silver droid who is coming out of a door.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{oh! nice to see a familiar face.}
<C>__{second threepio}
<P>__{(mumbles)}
<D>__{e chu ta!}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{how rude!}
<A>__{threepio stops, watching the silver droid move away. then he hears the muffled beeping and whistling of an r2 unit coming from within the room.}
