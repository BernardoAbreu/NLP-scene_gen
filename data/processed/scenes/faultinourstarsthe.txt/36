<D>__{she hasn't even visited. fourteen months we were together. what kind of person...}
<C>__{isaac's nurse}

<A>__{the nurse exits the room.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{is she gone?}

<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{did she really just say "you'll see?"}
<C>__{hazel}

<D>__{qualities of a good nurse. go.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{doesn't pun your disability.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{gets blood on the first try.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{that is huge. i mean, seriously, is this my freakin' arm or a dartboard? three no condescending voice.}
<C>__{hazel}
<P>__{(lays it on thick)}
<D>__{"i'm gonna stab you with this needle now, so there might be a little ouchie."}
<A>__{they laugh and then lapse into silence for a moment.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{you doing alright, isaac?}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{i don't know. to be honest, i think a hell of a lot more about monica than my eye. is that crazy? that's crazy.}

<D>__{it's a little crazy.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{but i believe in love, you know? i don't believe that everybody gets to keep their eyes or not get sick or whatever, but everybody should have true love. don't you think?}
<A>__{hazel thinks about it as isaac presses the button on his pain pump, self administering morphine.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{gus was here earlier.}
<C>__{hazel}
<P>__{(trying to be nonchalant)}
<D>__{was he?}
<A>__{isaac exhales as the pain pump starts to kick in.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{mmm... that's better.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{the pain?}
<P>__{(off his slow nod)}
<D>__{good. good, isaac.}
<P>__{(isaac closes his eyes)}
<D>__{what about gus?}
