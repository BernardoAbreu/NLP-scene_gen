<L>__{interior seymour & joe's living room evening}
<A>__{a depressing collectors' get together in progress. enid & rebecca sit on an old sofa in the corner. nine or ten record collectors mill about.}
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{there are some records i will pay serious money for, provided they're a sincere v plus. other than that i'd prefer to just have them on cd.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{cds will never have the presence of an original 78.}
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{wrr ong! a digital transfer adequately mastered will sound identical to the original. do you have a decent equalizer?}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{i have a klipsch 2b3.}
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{obviously the problem! you expect a ten band equalizer to impart state of the art sound? dream a little dream! etc...}
<A>__{enid & rebecca are sitting nearby.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i totally, totally hate you.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{aw c'mon, this is a fun party.}
<A>__{angle on: joe stands talking to gerrold, an obnoxious, pushy, fast talking guy who keeps eyeing rebecca. he shovels food into his mouth as he speaks.}
<C>__{gerrold}
<D>__{so what's the story with the two cheerleaders over here?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{they're seymour's.}
<C>__{gerrold}
<D>__{seymour? you gotta be kidding me!}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{don't worry about it. he's not gettin' any and neither are you.}
<C>__{gerrold}
<P>__{(poking joe in the chest)}
<D>__{let me tell ya somethin', joe... listen to me, joe... you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat!}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{gerrold walks over to where rebecca is sitting. he sits on the arm of sofa next to her.}
<C>__{gerrold}
<D>__{mind if i sit here?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<P>__{(staring straight ahead)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{gerrold}
<D>__{whoa, that was cold! hey, you're okay, you're pretty sharp. so uh... hey, you're wearing a green dress whadda you irish? i bet you're irish. what's your name?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{melorra...}
<C>__{gerrold}
<D>__{melorra, listen to me let me tell you something melorra... you seem like an interesting chick what are you doing hanging out with these losers here? whaddya say you and me take off and hit some nightspots etc. etc.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{i will be right back, i'm gonna go get a beer.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<P>__{(to enid)}
<D>__{wait...}
<A>__{enid goes over to the beer keg. nearby seymour stands talking to paul a humorless, middle aged guy in a suit and tie who's contemptuously examining one of seymour's 78s.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{...but it plays like new. there's no groove wear.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{oh please... it has an enlarged center hole and a hair crack.}
<A>__{enid approaches them.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{but the crack is so tight it's completely inaudible.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{a tight hair crack is just that a crack. i don't collect cracked records.}
<P>__{(walking away)}
<D>__{i only pay a premium for mint records seymour, you know that! please!}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{what was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{i... i didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... i mean if you had told me you were coming i would have warned you it's not like a real party or anything.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{you're right about that.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{so this is your record collection?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{oh god no. this is just junk i have for sale or trade. the record room is off limits.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{really? can i see it?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{yeah, well sure... you can if you want to... it's just i don't want all these guys in there at once... you know...}
