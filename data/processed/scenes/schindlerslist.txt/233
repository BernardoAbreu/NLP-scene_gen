<A>__{the torch firing at ice as hard as metal, blue flame, white steam. pfefferberg's eyes behind the mask again, concentrating. around the abandoned boxcar, in the gruesome cold, stand schindler, emilie, a doctor, some workers and some ss guards, watching, waiting. pfefferberg steps back. sledge hammers pound at locks. hands pull at levers. the doors begin to slide. out of darkness, from inside the boxcar as the doors slide open, schindler's face is revealed, tight. he stares for an interminable moment before walking slowly away. inside the boxcar is a tangle of limbs, a pyramid of corpses, frozen white. from a distance, a tableau: the boxcar, the workers and guards and emilie outside it, schindler, off to himself several steps away, all of them still as statues.}
