<L>__{int the ballroom continuous}
<A>__{in the glittering ballroom a children's choir sings.}
<C>__{children's choir}
<D>__{"we are the world..we are the children..."}
<A>__{behind the choir the double doors of the ballroom crash open... exposing tony violently beating up an `ethnic child.' stunned silence as the horror of this happy scene sinks in. then...}
<C>__{guests}
<D>__{my god! somebody stop him! he's a monster! get him!}
<A>__{as one they leap to their feet. tony looks up and freezes. at the same time the walls of the ballroom begin to crack and disintegrate. tony's world starts to fall apart... literally. the floor around tony falls away into an abyss leaving only a narrow escape route. he hurls anton aside and dashes away as the guests pursue him. anton avoids being trampled but, loses his footing and falls over the edge.}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{anton!!!}
<A>__{valentina, fighting through the angry guests, rushes to the edge of the abyss. anton is struggling to hold on to a broken floor joist that protrudes several feet down from the side of the cliff face.}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{valentina!..help me. please.}
<A>__{his grip slips. valentina reaches for him, grasps his hand.}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{forgive me, anton. i was wrong.}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{i know... i'm not a child.}
<A>__{and.. anton reverts to his normal size...and weight.}
<C>__{anton }
<D>__{i love you, valentina.}
<A>__{anton slips out of her grip, plummeting into the abyss.}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{noooo!}
<A>__{suddenly, valentina is jerked backwards by her hair.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{who's behind this!? eh!? you didn't come up with this all on your own did you!!!???}
<P>__{(slapping her)}
<D>__{no! someone's got at you. someone's paid you!!!... who!!!??? tell me!!!}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{valentina! my darling daughter! there you are!}
<A>__{they turn to see parnassus in the distance (where once the ballroom stood) stumbling towards them, drunk, desperate. as he moves forward a new landscape is created behind him. tony rushes towards parnassus.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{you old bastard! this is all your doing!}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<P>__{(drunkenly)}
<D>__{all my doing?... i'm merely the facilititatater, dear boy.}
<C>__{guests }
<D>__{there he is! stop him! leave her alone. get him!}
<A>__{throwing his arm around tony, parnassus spins him around to face the mob rushing towards him.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{i create the opportunities. is it my fault if your not up to it?}
<A>__{tony wrenches his arm free and violently shoves the drunken doctor right into the path of the frenzied mob. parnassus is trampled underfoot in their rush to catch tony.}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{father! no!}
<A>__{parnassus's body lies broken on the ground. frantically, valentina rushes to him, throwing herself on her father's battered body, sobbing hysterically.}
<C>__{valentina }
<D>__{no..no no... please.. father..it's all my fault. what have i done?...}
<A>__{with siren wailing, an ambulance arrives, screeching to a halt. paramedics pull valentina away. they check parnassus for signs of life and begin to lift him onto the gurney. valentina can't control herself and tries to throw herself onto his body. the paramedics struggle with her.}
<C>__{paramedic}
<P>__{(with a severe stutter)}
<D>__{p p p lease m mis s, there's s n n othing y y y you c can d d o, he he he's d d dead...}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{nooooo...!!!}
<A>__{valentina wrenches herself out of their grasp howling like an animal and rushes away out of earshot before the paramedic can finish speaking.}
<C>__{paramedic}
<D>__{...d dead drunk.}
<A>__{a bottle falls from the doctor's hand and explodes in a million fragments as it hits the ground. the shimmering fragments coalesce into a fractured mirror corridor down which a multi reflected valentina runs sobbing like a madwoman lashing out at her reflections, some of which are flashbacks of her flirting with tony, irritated with anton, angry with parnassus.}
<C>__{valentina}
<P>__{(to her reflections)}
<D>__{you little fool! you're to blame!.. for everything... i hate you!}
<A>__{the multi reflection broken mirror corridor ends at two mirrors identical to the one used in the imaginarium. the one to the left is marked 'his' with a bowler hat, the other to the right 'hers' with a bonnet. she hesitates.}
<C>__{valentina }
<P>__{(laughing madly)}
<D>__{so this is to be my choice!!}
<A>__{mr nick appears out of the "his" mirror a burst of flame behind him. he makes a sweeping gesture inviting valentina to enter the mirror marked 'hers'. valentina, heads for the mirror marked 'his'. mr nick blocks her path.}
<C>__{mr nick}
<D>__{now, there's absolutely no need for that. that's just plain contrariness.}
<A>__{valentina tries to get around him.}
<C>__{mr nick }
<D>__{you think you deserve punishment but you're a kid you have no idea...trust me.}
<A>__{valentina feints another direction. mr nick blocks her.}
<C>__{valentina}
<P>__{(a crazed look)}
<D>__{wrong. i'm 16...i'm a woman now..}
<A>__{she spins around him...he blocks....a kind of dance between them begins confusingly reflected in the mirrors. a tango can be heard.}
<C>__{valentina }
<D>__{...a selfish bitch, everyone i love dies...i'm...}
<C>__{mr nick}
<D>__{...only fit for hell? if only.}
<A>__{he looks at valentina with lascivious intent. he's tempted, briefly, but resists it.}
<C>__{mr nick }
<D>__{no... your pop would never speak to me again. and that'd be a shame. let's dance.}
<A>__{reflected in the swirling mirror fragments, they tango until he spins her towards the right hand mirror. she sails through and, with a mad smile, throws him a kiss. the mirror closes with a burst of flame. the briefest flash of dr. parnassus face is reflected in the mirror fragments.}
<D>__{doctor parnassus o s valentina!!!!!!}
<A>__{mr nick turns, realizing he has been looking into a mirror fragment reflecting the two mirrors. the writing on the valentina's mirror reads "his".}
<C>__{mr nick}
<D>__{damn!... i've won.}
