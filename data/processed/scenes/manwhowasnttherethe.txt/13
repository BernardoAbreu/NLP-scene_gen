<B>__{abundas house}
<A>__{it is night. we are looking through the screen door. walter abundas sits in yellow lamplight by a small table on the side of the staircase, over which papers are strewn. he is murmuring into the telephone as he examines the papers, glasses halfway down his nose, a drink in one hand. ed's hand enters to rap on the door. walter looks up, sets the phone down and comes to the door.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{ed, how're you holding up?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{i'm ok, walter, thanks.}
<A>__{walter opens the door to him.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i'm so damn sorry about your loss. terrible thing. just damn terrible.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{birdy's in the parlor i'm on long distance here.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{sure, walter. thanks.}

<D>__{hello, birdy.}
<C>__{birdy}
<D>__{we haven't seen you since... i'm terribly sorry.}
<A>__{ed sits across from her.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{birdy}
<D>__{we've certainly missed you.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{birdy, i've been doing a lot of thinking. there are a lot of things that haven't worked out for me. life has dealt me some bum cards...}
<A>__{he is loading a cigarette into his mouth.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{...or maybe i just haven't played 'em right, i don't know. but you're }
<C>__{birdy}
<D>__{pop doesn't like people smoking in here.}
<A>__{ed stares. this takes a moment to register.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{oh. sorry.}
<A>__{birdy lowers her voice:}
<C>__{birdy}
<D>__{sometimes i have a cigarette in here when he's away. never when he's in the house. he can smell it a mile off.}
<A>__{ed is pocketing the cigarette.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{sure... sure, it's his house.}
<C>__{birdy}
<D>__{that's what he keeps telling me.}
<A>__{ed smiles thinly.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{anyway, uh... my point is you're young. a kid really, your whole life ahead of you. but it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. before it all washes away.}
<C>__{birdy}
<D>__{well, sure, i guess. pop says so too. i work pretty hard at school.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{that's swell. however, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from mrs swan, they'll only take you so far. there's this guy in san francisco, i've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. his name is jacques carcanogues. i'm not sure i'm pronouncing it right. anyway, he's a frenchman.}
<C>__{birdy}
<D>__{boy.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{you've got talent, anyone could see that. and he's the best. if he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. you're a cinch to be accepted, i could cover the cost of the lessons, like i said, it's pretty modest }
<C>__{birdy}
<D>__{oh, mr crane }
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{i have to do it. i can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. you're young, you don't understand.}
<C>__{birdy}
<D>__{geez, mr crane, i don't know. i hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{i know you haven't. look, just go meet him as a favor to me. i talked to this guy. hope i pronounced his name right. he sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when i told him how talented you are. he agreed to see you this saturday. he said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. his words.}

<D>__{geez, mr crane.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{just see him, as a favor to me.}
<B>__{studio waiting room}
<A>__{it is a small square room with straightbacked chairs set against the walls. at the far end of the room a door leads to a studio from which piano music dully emanates; it is a fast and difficult piece of music. ed sits waiting. he is the only adult; two or three youngsters of different ages sit apparently waiting for their lessons. ed looks at one of the waiting boys in a white shirt and bow tie. he is perhaps eleven. his hair is greased back in a junior contour. another boy, in a cardigan sweater, sports a butch. the piano piece is ending. there is the murmur of voices. dull footsteps. the studio door swings open. a small man in a rumpled black suit smudged with cigarette ash is bowing birdy out the door. he has a goatee and a knotted foulard. his eyes flit over the waiting room and settle on ed.}

<D>__{sure, mr k.}
<A>__{a jerk of carcanogues' head bids ed rise.}
<B>__{studio}
<A>__{ed enters, uncomfortable. he looks around, taking in the high ceilinged space, which is dominated by a grand piano. carcanogues has followed him and now runs water from a tap.}
<C>__{carcanogues}
<D>__{i speak to you on ze phone, non? you have a special interest in music?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{carcanogues}
<D>__{ah yes, a music lover.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{well, i don't pretend to be an expert.}
<C>__{carcanogues}
<D>__{ah.}
<A>__{he uncaps a small bottle of pills, shakes two into his palm, tosses them back and washes them down.}
<C>__{carcanogues}
<D>__{...ah hah.}
<A>__{he twists a cigarette into a long holder, sticks it in his mouth and lights it.}
<C>__{carcanogues}
<D>__{...mm.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{well? how'd she do?}
<A>__{this elicits a gallic frown of consideration.}
<C>__{carcanogues}
<D>__{ze girl?... she seems like a very nice girl. she plays, monsieur, like a very nice girl. ztinks. very nice girl. however, ztinks.}
<C>__{ed}

<C>__{carcanogues}
<D>__{is not so hard to understand. her playing, very polite.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{did she make mistakes?}
<A>__{another gallic moue:}
<C>__{carcanogues}
<D>__{mistake, no, it says e flat, she plays e flat. ping ping. hit the right note, always. very proper.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{i don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid i thought you taught the, uh, the }
<C>__{carcanogues}
<D>__{ah, but that is just what i cannot teach. i cannot teach her to have a soul. look, monsieur, play the piano, is not about the fingers. done with the fingers, yes. but the music, she is inside. inside, monsieur...}
<A>__{a two handed gesture, indicating his heart.}
<C>__{carcanogues}
<D>__{...the music start here...}
<A>__{he waggles his fingers:}
<C>__{carcanogues}
<D>__{...come out through here; then, maybe...}
<A>__{his wave takes in the heavens:}
<C>__{carcanogues}
<D>__{...she can go up there.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{well, look, i don't claim to be an expert }
<C>__{carcanogues}
<D>__{then you listen to me, for i am expert. that girl, she give me a headache. she cannot play. nice girl. very clever hands. nice girl. someday, i think, maybe, she make a very good typist.}
<B>__{driving}
<A>__{we are driving through the rural countryside of northern california. it is a two lane road with little traffic. sun strobes the car through the passing trees. ed drives, glaring. birdy, next to him, seems unperturbed, ever cheerful.}

<D>__{...i stank, didn't i?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{he didn't say that.}
<C>__{birdy}

<C>__{ed}
<D>__{i'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. more qualified. goddamn phony.}

<D>__{but it doesn't matter. really, i'm not interested in playing music professionally.}
<A>__{ed looks at her.}
<C>__{birdy}
<D>__{...i'm not certain i will have a career at all, and if i do, i will probably be a veterinarian.}

<D>__{...uh huh.}
<C>__{birdy}
<D>__{i do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{ah... it's nothing.}

<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...and then it stops. i thought, what keeps it growing? is it like a plant in soil? what goes out of the soil? the soul? and when does the hair realize that it's gone?}
<A>__{we are high, looking down at ed, who is motionless, head resting on the steering wheel of the stopped car. we boom down toward his, slowly rotating as we move in. as we move we lose focus; ed becomes more and more blurry. the blurry shape is now slowly spinning away from us, a bright revolving disc spinning up into the darkness until it disappears, leaving only black.}
