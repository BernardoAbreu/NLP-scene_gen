<A>__{it is early morning and already hot. insects drone, crackle, and scurry for shade. prairie dogs burrow to escape the sun. we can see the heat shimmering off the surface of the earth. on a dusty highway, a pair of vultures dine on a dead coyote. one of them snags an intestine and tugs a few feet of it out of the carcass. in the distance, where a long, dusty road meets the horizon, a small shape appears a sixty four and a half mustang convertible, its top down. its candy apple red burns like a brilliant fireball under the sun. as the car drifts closer, we see steam escaping from under the hood. sammi smith's "please help me get through the night" plays on the car's radio.}
