<L>__{interior masry & vititoe, conference room day}
<A>__{the table is covered with boxes of documents: the anticipated slew of paper that pg&e is sending them. ed, kurt, theresa, andrew and about five paralegals are sifting through them. erin breezes in like sunshine.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{morning!}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{erin? what are you }
<C>__{erin}
<P>__{(ignoring ed)}
<D>__{you know what, mr. potter? i completely forgot your birthday this year. and seeing as how you've been so good to me, i think that is a terrible oversight. so what i been doing over the last few days is i've been putting together a present for you.}
<A>__{she plunks the box down on the table. potter opens the top of the box. looks in.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{635. they all signed. every single one.}
<A>__{in the doorway, anna, brenda and jane appear, wondering what's up. a huge smile of appreciation slowly spreads across ed's face.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{ho ly shit.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{oh, now don't get all jealous, ed. i got a little something for you, too.}
<A>__{erin hands ed a manila envelope. he opens it.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{internal pg&e documents, all about the contamination. the one i like best says, and i'm paraphrasing here, but it says yes, the water's poisonous, but it'd be better for all involved if this matter wasn't discussed with the neighbors. it's to the hinkley station, from pg&e headquarters. stamped received, march, 1966.}
<A>__{potter and theresa reel. ed shakes his head in disbelief.}
<C>__{potter}
<D>__{where did how did you do this?}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{well, what with me not having any brains or legal expertise, i just went on up there and performed sexual favors. 635 blow jobs in five days. whew, am i ever tired.}
<A>__{and she struts out of the room, leaving everyone slack jawed. the clip clip clip of her heels carry her away.}
