<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior lazarus's home later that afternoon}
<A>__{rae is screaming and grunting as laz, standing in his kitchen, tugs on the chain around the door jam like he's drawing water from a well. outside rae struggles to hold onto the porch post. laz pulls hard, lifting her lower torso off the ground.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{stop it! stop it! it hurts!}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{whose doin' is that?}
<A>__{laz yanks. rae loses her grip and slams onto the porch.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{okay... okay! i'm comin' in! now quit it!}
<A>__{the pulling stops. rae picks herself up. her knees and hands are scraped and bleeding. the two stare at each other.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{say we talk. just take a seat on the sofa. i will get us somethin' cool to drink.}
<A>__{laz crosses to the kitchen. rae sits down on the couch, noticing the fallen lamp on the floor.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{you may not remember. but you spent a whole half day in my tub, tryin' to cool down. melted four ice trays.}
<A>__{he finishes preparing the two waters. he crosses into the front room. rae is not there. crash! rae smashes the lamp on laz's head. the water glasses shatter as laz falls to the floor. rae picks up a wooden chair and breaks it over his back. before she can do any more damage, laz grabs her by the wrists and throws her to the couch. rae falls to the floor. laz stumbles on his feet as he clutches his bleeding head. he loses his cool.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{wicked little bitch... gonna cut me...}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{you gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this!}
<A>__{rae freezes as she sees laz undo his belt buckle. her breath starts to quiver as she deeply inhales and exhales.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{think i'm gonna let you do me like that...}
<A>__{laz whips his belt off and wraps the buckle around his fist. he stops in his tracks. rae is panting and shaking. her middle finger is scratching at her own thigh.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<P>__{(regaining his cool)}
<D>__{okay, now... i ain't gonna hit'cha.}
<P>__{(the burning is starting)}
<D>__{just lost my cool there.}
<P>__{(he throws the belt away)}
<D>__{now take that look out'cha eye.}
<A>__{her anguished hum can be heard through her clenched teeth as she rocks back and forth. her hands wander down to her inner thighs.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{no, ma'am. you stop that foolishness.}
<C>__{rae}
<P>__{(shaking her head)}
<D>__{hm mm... hm mm...}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{i said... stop!}
<C>__{rae}
<P>__{(on the verge of crying)}
<D>__{i can't!}
<A>__{rae gets dizzy. she rests the top of her head on the floor and sways back and forth. laz rushes out the front door. as the wave hits, rae twists and turns, wrapping the chain around her. she grips the radiator with both hands and rests her face against the side.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{hmmmmmm... stop it!... stop it!}
<A>__{the wave is about to build in to a powerful climax. rae gasps for breath. the door slams open. laz drenches her with a gallon of cold well water from a tin bucket. rae inhales and freezes. laz waits and watches. the burning is gone. laz kneels next to her and gently frees her bare ankle from the tangled chain.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{you hungry?}
