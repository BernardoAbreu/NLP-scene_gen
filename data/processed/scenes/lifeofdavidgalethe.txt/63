<L>__{exterior motel six parking lot night}
<A>__{bitsey and zack are walking from the kettle to their rooms. zack is lighting a cigarette. the rain's stopped, but the lot is wet.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{try phone records, a net search.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{fucking better than watching you work.}
<A>__{they walk a beat in silence.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{you think he's telling the truth?}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{don't ask me that. i don't know. there is no truth, only perspectives.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{can't say that. if you say 'there is no truth,' you're claiming it's true that there is no truth it's a logical contradiction.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{working on our philosophy merit badge, zack?}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{i, on the other hand, think gale's telling the truth.}
<A>__{they come to the stairs and start up.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{this you know telepathically?}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{it's just my perspective.}
<A>__{in a dark corner of the parking lot sits the pickup from the rest area. the older cowboy watches bitsey and zack climb the stairs. on his stereo, puccini plays. once they are in their rooms, he turns up the opera, closes his eyes, feels the music.}
