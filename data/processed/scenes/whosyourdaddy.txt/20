<L>__{interior stretch limo day}
<A>__{ted and charlie sit on opposites ends of the plush interior. charlie eyes the control console with its slew of gadgets. they practically have to shout to hear one another.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{...a bouncer? are you serious?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{maybe he got promoted.}
<A>__{charlie continues playing with the console switches.}
<C>__{ted }
<D>__{don't. touch. anything.}
<A>__{too late. rock music pulsates through the limo.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{this is the life, baby. we get ourselves some tail and we're talking spring break!}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{cut it out, before you break something!}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{for a guy about to try his first dom perignon, you are extremely uptight.}
<A>__{he flips another switch. the bar opens. revealing a bottle of dom perignon on ice. charlie grins broadly.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{we can't afford that!}
<A>__{charlie grabs the bottle and starts to open it.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{don't you know anything about limo etiquette? everything in here is included for our pleasure.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{wait a second, i thought we were hamburger guys.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{and like every hamburger guy knows, when you get your one big chance at the good life, you abuse every second of it until they figure out you don't belong there and kick your sorry ass out.}
<A>__{pop! the cork flies through the air. bounces off the ceiling. and hits another switch. the sun roof glides open. champagne overflows from the bottle. all over charlie's crotch.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{nice. is that in the limo etiquette handbook, too?}
<A>__{charlie grabs a bar towel as ted looks toward the sun roof. beautifully blue southern california sky greets him. with an occasional palm tree swooshing by. ted rises.}
