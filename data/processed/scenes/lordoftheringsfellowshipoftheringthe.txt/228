<A>__{camera sweeps past saruman...he stands on the summit of orthanc, chanting. clouds are flowing from all directions... converging on the distant mountains in a stormy malestrom.}
<L>__{exterior pass of caradhras day}
<A>__{saruman's voice strengthens...rolling past the fellowship like thunder. a lightning crack explodes on the mountainside above them. frodo looks up in horror as a huge snow avalanche thunders down towards them! the fellowship throw themselves against the cliff face as snow crashes onto the narrow ledge. legolas pulls gandalf to safety. aragorn shields frodo and sam as snow piles around them. within moments, the pass is blocked and the fellowship are enveloped in snow. boromir and aragorn frantically dig for the hobbits...who are pulled out shivering and fearful.}
<C>__{boromir}
<P>__{(urgent)}
<D>__{we must get off the mountain! make for the gap of rohan and take the west road to my city.}
<C>__{aragorn}
<D>__{the gap of rohan takes us too close to isengard.}
<C>__{gimli}
<D>__{we cannot pass over the mountain. let us go under it. let us go through the mines of moria. gandalf has a concerned look on his face.}
<C>__{saruman }
<D>__{moria. you fear to go into those mines, don't you? the dwarves delved too greedily and too deep. saruman (v.o.) (cont'd) you know what they awoke in, the darkness of khazad dum. shadow and flame.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{let the ringbearer decide.}
<A>__{close on: frodo, the weight of the decision weighing heavily upon him. close on: merry and pippin shivering in boromir's arms.}
<C>__{gandalf }
<D>__{frodo?}
<A>__{frodo meets gandalf's eye.}
<C>__{frodo}
<D>__{we will go through the mines. gandalf slowly nods.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{so be it.}
