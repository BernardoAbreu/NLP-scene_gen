<A>__{the elevator descends. bars of light move rhythmically across her as ripley stands facing the doors, watching the landings go by. the heat grows more intense. pipes glowing cherry red pass by. steam hisses and billows. the lift clatters in a steady beat. hypnotic. ripley removes her jacket and dons a battle harness directly over her t shirt. her hair is matted, and she glistens with sweat. her eyes burn with a determination that holds the gut panic in check. the elevator descends. she checks her weapon. attaches a bandolier of grenades to her harness. primes the flamethrower. checks the rifle's magazine. racks the bolt, chambering the first round. she checks the marking flares jammed in the thigh pockets of her jump pants. she drops an unprimed grenade, trembling, forcing herself to be strong. we see she doesn't know doodley about grenades. this is the most terrifying thing she has ever done. she begins to hyperventilate, soaking with sweat. her fingers slick and slippery on the rifle. the elevator descends. the lift motors whine, slowing. it hits bottom with a bump. the safety cage retracts. slowly, expectantly, the doors open. her p.o.v. through the parting doors...an empty corridor. dark, swirling with steam, a ruddy glow visible here and there. it seems to have been a descent into dantean hell. the air itself vibrates with heat distortion. couplings groan. machinery whines and throbs. like the beating of a vast heart the pounding of massive pumps echoes through the station.}
