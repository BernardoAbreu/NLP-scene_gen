<L>__{interior tiptree's bedroom day}
<A>__{wallowing in despair, tiptree sits at an antique secretary composing a letter. he takes a long pull on a glass of scotch, signs his name, and inserts the letter into an envelope. he opens the desk drawer takes a long look at a .38 automatic stashed inside then finds a stamp and affixes it to the envelope. he addresses it to bruce wayne. a moment later he hears a noise at the window: tink tink tink. he peers through the blinds and sees a carrier pigeon on the ledge outside pecking at the glass, asking to come in. he raises the window and the pigeon hops fearlessly inside, onto the sill. the bird, well trained, struggles only slightly as he unties a tiny capsule from its leg and removes a folded note. scrawled across it is a handwritten message:}
<B>__{if police see this your family is dead}
<A>__{he opens the note and begins to read as the pigeon takes wing.}
