<L>__{exterior flea market, berlin day}
<A>__{freezing weather. a narrow street, crowded, busy, noisy. some makeshift stalls set out, trestle tables, open suitcases, people buying and selling every imaginable commodity. emmi wanders through the crowd, passing a violinist, helmuth rode, wrapped up against the cold, playing handel's air on a g string, a bowl for money at his feet. a passer by drops a cigarette butt in it. immediately, rode retrieves the butt. emmi comes to a stall selling piles of gramophone records. she asks the stallholder a question. he points to another stall across the way.}
