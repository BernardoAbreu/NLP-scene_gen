<A>__{kate who eats a piece of cake sits on a patio with jenny, mr. davies, and several other people from aa.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i'm really proud of you, kate.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i kinda can't believe it's been ninety days.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the longest i've gone since high school without drinking was, like, a week.}
<C>__{mr. davies}
<D>__{my first three months were such hell. i think i'm only sober today because i just never want to go through that again.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{it's weird in after school specials the getting sober part was only like a minute of the movie and suddenly...daddy's all okay.}
<A>__{several people laugh.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{but it's so fucking hard and weird and suddenly i have all these other problems now that drinking isn't the problem.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{everything else. work, my non existent relationship with my mom...}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{when was the last time you saw her?}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(tries to remember)}
<D>__{a year, at least.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{well...maybe it's time.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{maybe.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and then there's my marriage. i mean, charlie's great. really great, he's supportive, especially at first. it's strange, though. i feel like alcohol was the thing that connected us and now that i don't drink we lead these two very different lives.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we haven't slept together in forever...}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i haven't pissed myself in awhile, though. so that's good.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{it takes time.}
<A>__{kate gives an exasperated look.}
<C>__{jenny }
<P>__{(half stern cheerleader tone)}
<D>__{keep working the steps.}
<P>__{(glances at her watch)}
<D>__{let's grab coffee tomorrow, okay? i should actually run you home now and come back. i need to start locking up.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i could stick around and help you...}
<C>__{mr. davies}
<P>__{(to kate)}
<D>__{i could take you home.}
<P>__{(off kate's reaction)}
<D>__{if you want.}
