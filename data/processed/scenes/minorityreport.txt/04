<L>__{exterior the house moments later}
<A>__{johnny stands on the front porch, scratching. he walks down his front walk, and bends over to pick up the newspaper. carol stands in the doorway, watching him. a shadow slides over johnny, cast from above. the air fills with the piercing whine of an engine. johnny looks up, alarmed. in the sky above him, just beyond the tips of the suburban trees, is a black precrime police hovercraft. the children, the mothers, carol in the doorway everyone freezes in place, as johnny is cast into an inexplicable drama. racing soundlessly down the street toward him, are sleek technological marvels, lethal and efficient looking they seem to be cars but they are so different from the fat fords and chevies in the driveways that it is hard for us to process them. helmeted police with mirrored visors erupt out of the cars. more police drop from the hovercraft in harnesses. their uniforms are black, seem actually to absorb light. their left hands are bare, their right hands are encased in some sort of complicated glove.}
<B>__{close}
<A>__{on a glove the glove is a weapon of some kind, the elongated index finger ending in an open barrel. clearly, this is not, as it first seemed, the past not america in the 1950's. it is the neo past, the retro world of america 2040, where the familiar of yesterday is intermeshed with hypertechnology. and all of that hypertechnology is focused on johnny, as he makes a run for the house, sheets of newspaper scattering behind him. he bursts up the front porch, shoving carol out of the way. eight precrime police officers assemble in the yard. from a backpack, one of them quickly removes an instrument with a handle grip and an ovoid screen. it is a holographic scanner. he activates it, scans the officer in front of him, and an identical police officer takes three dimensional form. the two real officers circle the house, repeating the maneuver a dozen times. in less than a minute, a decoy force of men three dimensional, standing in place, but shifting and turning like living beings has been created. an overwhelming police deterrent presence has been established.}
<B>__{inside the house}
<A>__{the precrime police overwhelm the interior of the house, too. it is impossible to tell which officers are real, and which are scanned holographs. the juxtaposition of the futuristic cops in a 1950's style house is disorienting.}
<B>__{inside a bedroom closet}
<A>__{johnny, in his pajamas, crouches beneath a rack full of his wife's dresses.}
<B>__{upstairs hallway}
<A>__{two officers, standing back to back, hold their gloved hands out in front of them, palm out. when the first officer points his palm toward a door at the end of the hallway, his glove beeps softly. the officer looks at his palm. a red thermal image appears on a small flexible screen the heat outline of a crouching man. the first officer flicks his helmeted head to the second officer.}
<B>__{the bedroom}
<A>__{the room is packed with police how many are real?}
<B>__{the closet}
<A>__{johnny squirms, his pajamas saturated with sweat. he calls out through the door.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{i didn't do anything!}
<B>__{outside the closet}
<A>__{every officer in the room lifts his gloved hand and points his index barrel at the closet door. the effect is deeply accusatory. an officer speaks, his voice electronically manipulated to be as menacing as possible.}
<C>__{officer 1}
<D>__{come out of the closet on your hands and knees.}
<A>__{nothing happens. two officers aim their barrels at the perimeter of the door. in repeated, small sonic blasts, the closet door is blown off of its frame, revealing johnny among the dresses. johnny starts to rise, and bam, a section of floorboards is blasted away beneath his feet.}
<C>__{officer 1}
<D>__{hands and knees!}
<A>__{johnny trips among the splintered floorboards, and drops. he stays on his hands and knees, and approaches. he lifts his head and looks up at the officer.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{i didn't...}
<A>__{another officer 2 bends down with a device the words "identiscan" on its side and blips a red laser light into each of johnny's, eyes, reading his irises. the officer nods affirmatively to the other officer.}
<C>__{officer 2}
<D>__{positive for john palmer.}
<C>__{officer 1}
<P>__{(to johnny)}
<D>__{john palmer, if you were being arrested for any other crime, i would now read you your rights.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but you are under arrest for the future murderer of your wife, carol palmer. you have no rights.}
<A>__{johnny, on his hands and knees, goes limp.}
