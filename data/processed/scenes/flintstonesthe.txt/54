<L>__{interior assembly line night}
<A>__{as the workers continue their rampage, piltdown and pyrite reappear.}
<C>__{pyrite}
<D>__{darn that flintstone and rubble... they're gonna screw everything up...}
<C>__{piltdown}
<D>__{not if we give 'em a nice long vacation... in the hospital.}
<A>__{saying this, he grips tightly on a wrench. then some rampaging workers rush by. piltdown gives them an encour aging cheer, and then he and pyrite lead them up some stairs to the assembly line catwalk. there, pyrite begins smashing some light fixtures with a club, while piltdown uses brute strength to snap big support beams which he flings below. close pyrite winds up for another baseball type swing but as he follows through, the ball shaped light fixture jerks up on its cable. unable to stop in time, pyrite spins around, falls on his ass. barney drops down into view, hanging horizontally from the rafters. he's holding the light fixture with his free hand.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{stee rike one! heh hey. ready for a curve ball?}
<A>__{pyrite doesn't have a sense of humor; club in hand, he jumps up, starts chasing barney through the rafters.}
<B>__{piltdown}
<A>__{spits on his hand, grabs another big beam. he pulls down on it... but it doesn't snap, it goes right up again. puzzled, he pulls down on it again... there's another see saw motion... ... this time piltdown goes with the flow, pushes up and peers under the beam...}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{fred is hanging on the other end.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{brother piltdown... can we talk about this, antler to antler?}
<A>__{piltdown roars, begins slamming the girder up and down.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{guess not...}
<A>__{fred inches down the shuddering beam, jumps off. freed of fred's weight, the other end "boings" down on piltdown's head. he groans, recovers in time to chase after fred.}
<B>__{barney and pyrite}
<A>__{square off in the rafters.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{give me your best shot.}
<A>__{pyrite swings. barney ducks and pyrite smashes a window pane. barney dodges again and the same thing happens. getting cocky, barney does it one more time... ... but this time the window is hinged in the center and the swivel action after the hit whaps barney on the back and knocks him into pyrite's next blow.}
<B>__{fred}
<A>__{is backpedaling away from piltdown on the upper super structure of the assembly line. fred scrapes one foot in an arc in front of him.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{dare you to cross that line.}
<A>__{piltdown crosses it.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{that line.}
<A>__{piltdown crosses it. fred "marks" another one. piltdown doesn't even wait for the challenge, takes a giant step. oops. bad idea: the last "line" was at the edge of a straight drop! piltdown yelps, "treads air" in the best cartoon manner and then desperately grabs a handful of fred's clothing! both men fall at the last minute piltdown catches a ladder! below assembly line fred lands with a thud right in the clay mold used to form the fibre products! worse, the impact arouses the goatasauruses out of their sleep. dutifully, they rise, and then ram both sides of the mold just as fred is struggling to his feet! fred's yell is muffled by the clay.}
<B>__{other assembly line animals}
<A>__{aroused by the "start up" of the assembly line, they do their job. fibre foam begins to chug down the trough: the alligator crane picks up the mold, shakes it.}
<B>__{fred}
<A>__{is flung to the conveyor belt, stiffly caked in clay.}
<B>__{the fibre mold}
<A>__{shudders and shakes out a fibre statue of... fred!}
<B>__{below}
<A>__{the real fred, moving stiffly like a robot, is getting to his feet when his fibre doppleganger slams him to the mat again! a moment later, another "fred" drops down beside him.}
<B>__{piltdown}
<A>__{has descended the ladder, hopping mad. now, he sees fred coming toward him... piltdown breaks a big lever off the equipment, swings reacts astonished as "fred"}
<B>__{shatters. fred}
<A>__{back down the line, he's seen this. his clay caked adam's apple gulps. quickly, he turns and tries to "tip toe" away then, with a creak and crunch the clay and fibre all over him solidifies! desperate, he tries to move... can't!}
<B>__{piltdown}
<A>__{watches, confused, as dozens of fred flintstones chug towards him on the belt. he shrugs, smashes the next one in line. another phoney. he smashes the next one...}
