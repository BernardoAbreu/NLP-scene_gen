<A>__{est. hitler's headquarters for the eastern front is bustling. security is tight, everyone is on edge.}
<L>__{interior army group center mess hall day}
<A>__{long tables packed with soldiers straining their necks to get a glimpse of their leader at the head table, but he is obscured by his detail of ss guards. one man dares to approach. the room falls silent. hitler's personal chef places a tray before the fuhrer, producing a knife and fork, cutting a bite. we think he is going to hand feed hitler until he places the food in his own mouth, chewing slowly, deliberately. he swallows. we wait for him to die. when he doesn't, hitler begins to eat. the rest of the room relaxes slightly and digs in. angle on: seated further down the table are tresckow and his aide. between them, once again, is brandt, eating like a pig, still making notes in his book. tresckow stares.}

<P>__{(in between mouthfuls)}
<D>__{irregularity is the fuhrer's precaution of choice.}
<C>__{tresckow}
<D>__{i can assure you he's safe here. relax, brandt. enjoy your meal.}
<A>__{brandt's look says, "don't be ridiculous." he cleans his plate in seconds. then he gently dabs his mouth, takes out his datebook and starts writing once again the precise man we saw on the airfield.}
<C>__{tresckow }
<D>__{i understand you're returning to berlin this afternoon...}
<A>__{brandt nods.}
<C>__{tresckow }
<D>__{could i trouble you to deliver a package to colonel stieff?}
<A>__{brandt nods again, too busy writing to notice the knowing glance tresckow shares with his aide...}
