<A>__{he enters the chamber again, and the attacks start again. drew, however, is prepared (both mentally and physically). he blocks, avoids, rolls, jumps and redirects the attacks on him, making his way across. he is about halfway across when an especially fierce and large statue comes crashing towards him. drew, caught a little off guard, quickly adjusts and manages to jump and spin out of the way. suddenly, as he turns and tries to get his breath, two huge, deadly spears are streaking towards him. drew blocks the spears with his arms, misdirecting them into the wall behind him. they thwock into the wall, sticking there. as he rounds a particularly difficult series of statues, a volley of arrows comes hurtling towards him. drew blocks some, avoids others, and catches one in each hand. he throws them down and continues on. he goes past the few remaining statues, and is out of the wooden man chamber. all that is left is to walk down a little hallway and out the door. drew looks behind him, then starts to walk. he goes cautiously, expecting a trap or a trick. nothing happens. he gets to the door and looks for a handle on the door. he spots a handhold near the top of the door, and pulls it with his hand. immediately, his hands is locked in and a panel in the ceiling drops right onto his arm, forcing it down. drew fights back with his muscles, the veins popping out in his arms and neck. behind him, a statue has started coming towards him, spinning like a dervish. its fists and legs are extended, and they are deadly. the panel drops lower and lower.}
