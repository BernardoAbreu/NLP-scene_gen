<A>__{white is still waiting for his food. he leans down to scratch an itchy ankle, lifts his trouser leg to examine the bites worse, inflamed. he uses a napkin to wipe at the pus. aerial perspective of a fly circling the room, looking down on white. on the fly it lands on a plate of half eaten food on another table. the creature is some kind of surveillance device half insect half machine. itis spying on him. move in tight as inbuilt camera lenses focus in its head. it shits on the food behind it. white is oblivious to this. heis finished examining his leg, is sitting quietly. he yawns. his head nods forward briefly. a noise. white looks up. a trap door has opened in the ceiling. two feet in black leather shoes descend from the hole. a sea breeze blows through the room. the sound of surf, seagulls crying. on whiteis nose twitching. he can smell the ocean. the wallpaper comes alive like a seething tangle of worms. one by one, three men in black coats lower into the room, floating on air. they pull out knifes, step forward. on white rigid with terror. on the men though their faces cannot be seen clearly in the gloom, they too resemble the man who confronted white earlier. they walk towards him slowly, holding knifes above their heads. ready to attack. they lean over him, pause dramatically.}

<A>__{angle a chair falls to the floor. white leaps up from the table, terrified, disoriented. just a dream he had dozed. widen angle the place is still empty. white glances to the serving window. a dish waits for him, framed in the glowing fluoro square. he gets it. a bowl of soupy liquid with noodles. he sits down. he is about to start eating realizes he has a fork instead of a spoon. picking up the bowl again, he heads to the kitchen.}
