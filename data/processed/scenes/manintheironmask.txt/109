<L>__{1600's, we see one particular couple a large man, with an}
<A>__{excessively large woman. they are dancing vigorously, and as they take a break behind a huge pillar, they lift their masks enough for us to see that the man is aramis, and the "woman" is porthos. from the folds of their elaborate costumes they both withdraw replicas of the iron mask that phillippe once wore.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{d'artagnan watches everything. we have to be lucky.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{we will make our own luck tonight... if phillippe holds up.}
<A>__{aramis peers across the ballroom, to where athos and phillippe mix among the revelers, using thin sticks to hold broad masks to their faces. behind the masks we see their eyes athos' intense, phillippe's nervous and darting.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{stay calm, you're doing fine.}
<A>__{then phillippe's eyes go strangely still; he sees, for the first time in his life, his twin brother, the king.}
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{my brother...}
<A>__{louis dances the minuet, prancing as if he is the center of the universe; but this bliss is broken when one of the dancers who swirls by him it is aramis lifts the baroque outer mask he's wearing and reveals an iron mask beneath. the king staggers, stopping. the sight stuns him, confuses him; he looks around but the wearer of the mask has disappeared among the weaving patterns of dancers. louis' hands dart to his eyes: are they playing tricks on him? seeing his reaction, phillippe whispers }
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{he knew. he knew what they did to me.}
<A>__{the young beauty dancing with louis notices him falter.}
<C>__{young beauty}
<D>__{what is wrong, your majesty?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{nothing, i continue.}
<A>__{louis rejoins the dancing... and then sees, on the balcony above him, a different person a huge "woman," porthos who lifts off an outer mask to reveal an iron mask below.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{there! do you see it?}
<C>__{young beauty}
<D>__{see what, majesty?}
<A>__{porthos has slipped away from the railing when the king looks back up; the young beauty sees nothing, and turns back to the king with a look that questions his sanity. d'artagnan notices the king's reaction though he did not see the glimpse of the iron mask and is just as baffled as everyone else when the king turns and staggers away.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{your majesty...?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{... tired. must... lie down.}
<A>__{the music splatters to an awkward stop; louis hurries out, leaving his partner abandoned in the center of the ballroom, with everyone staring as if she just ruined the party.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{carry on, everyone...}
<A>__{the music begins again, and the party goers, not knowing what else to do, politely continue. athos draws phillippe away from the ballroom, into a side corridor.}
<B>__{at the foot of the stairs to the balcony}
<A>__{porthos waddles down stairs, and meets aramis.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{quick, to the passages.}
<A>__{they hurry in the same direction athos and phillippe went.}
