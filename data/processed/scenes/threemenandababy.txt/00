<A>__{on a chartered plane flying from miami to newark airport. jack is the captain. his copilot paul is seated beside him. in the passenger cabin, a female gymnastics team is celebrating a hard won, glorious victory over the miami team. they are singing, dancing in the aisles and drinking champagne. in the rear of the cabin, there are three regular pass engers: a teenager, his mother, and a man who appears to be a businessman. the plane is flying over the coastline. the partition between the cockpit and the passenger cabin is open. jack is very excited. he can't stop turning around to look at the passengers.}

<A>__{jack gets up and paul takes his place at the controls. jack makes his way up the aisle, through the girls who are blocking the way, to the object of his affections. she is sitting in one of the aisle seats and singing her head off. jack leans over and whispers, quickly and intensely, to her.}
