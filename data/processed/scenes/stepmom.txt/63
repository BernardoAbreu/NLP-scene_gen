<L>__{exterior a perfectly manicured two story home day}
<A>__{a door with balloons opens stacy, the birthday boy's mom, stands there children running behind her in party hats, all with their conservatively dressed suburban moms. rachel's attire a sharp contrast.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{hi, i'm here to pick up ben.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{does jackie know this?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{no. i'm doing it behind her back.}

<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{tucker hasn't penned ben's present yet it won't be too much longer.}
<A>__{rachel eyes the mound of presents yet to be opened. dissolve to:}
<B>__{...}
<A>__{forty five minutes later...rachel, in a pointed party hat, sits schmushed on the couch in between all the other mothers. a black jeans stranger in a strange peach land. she eyes that mound of presents. not even a dent. she pulls out her cell phone, moves towards the hallway.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{hey cooper...pull a number 64 steel blue gel on the back light...yeah i'm on my way but...}
<A>__{a piece of cake flies through the air and lands on rachel.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{now ben, let tucker play with his batcave...}
<A>__{ben won't let go of tucker's presents. tucker tries to take it. ben is adamant. rachel reaches for him, tousling his hair.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{hey benjy boy chill.}
<P>__{(he shimmies away from her)}
<D>__{he's there already? no i don't want to talk to him duncan? how are you...}
<A>__{the mothers are all too aware of rachel on the phone. two kids shoot water guns rachel gets drenched. ben pulls at the toys...}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i want it!}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{ben i know you're angry and confused but it's tucker's birthday party.}
<A>__{ben and tucker fight for it the mothers all look to rachel.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{ben }
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{duncan i'm aware of that goddamn it ben! let go of it. now!}
<A>__{he stares at her. it looks like he's gonna let go on the mothers impressed, not to mention surprised. when ben suddenly hurls the toy onto the floor shattering it! a horrible silence falls over the room. broken only by the sound of duncan screaming from inside the phone.}
<C>__{duncan in phone}
<D>__{rachel...this is a big bloody account if you don't show up in five minutes...}
<A>__{rachel takes ben and leads him into another room.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{ben i'm sorry. it's been a hard day. now would you do us both a favor and take this phone and...}
<A>__{she slams the phone shut. hands it to ben.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{...make it disappear.}
<A>__{okay. he shoves it down the front of his pants. the peach moms are taken aback. rachel nods, you got it. delighted, ben turns, scampers off, as... ...his pants start ringing. he stops dead. looks down at them. still ringing. he turns around and waddles delicately back to rachel, as if he's carrying nitro in his shorts. she holds out her hand...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{breaks out the geiger counter, the man is radio active!}
<A>__{he pulls the ringing phone from his pants. she grasps it without hesitation, while peach moms wince in disgust. snaps it open...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{get over it, dunc...}
<P>__{(stops)}
<D>__{...whoa, whoa, annab...}
<A>__{listens. while everybody watches.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{could it be, maybe... anywhere else? like...another galaxy would be more convenient.}
<A>__{listening, listening. everybody really watching. even ben. rachel oblivious...}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{okay, don't cry. flunking science is not happening. on my watch.}
