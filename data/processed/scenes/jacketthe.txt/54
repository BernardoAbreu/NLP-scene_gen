<L>__{interior waitress' apartment, evening}
<A>__{she is on the phone, calling various shelters. her apartment has some pieces of mismatched furniture, along with a string of lopsided christmas lights strewn around the windows in the room. they, more than anything else, light the place.}
<D>__{waitress [pleading tone] i could have him there in 15 minutes. [beat, disappointed] hmm. yeah, thanks. merry christmas to you, too.}
<A>__{she hangs up the phone.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{great. that was our last option. what am i going to do with you?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{nothing. [getting up] thanks for bringing me this far.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{where are you going? you'll freeze out there. you don't even have a coat.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i will manage.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{no, you won't. you'll die of cold out there and then i will have to feel guilty. and i've already got more guilt than i know what to do with. [beat] do you want something to drink?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{no, i'm ok.}
<A>__{she leaves to the kitchen to fix herself a drink and starks stares after her. suddenly, a smashing sound is heard as something falls in the kitchen. starks' whole body tenses up as he wonders whether he's being taken out of the jacket.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{shit! that was one of my good glasses!}
<A>__{as she presumably cleans it up, we stay on starks who slowly gains hold of himself. she comes back, drink in hand and pushes the strand of hair in her face back the same way she did when he saw her in the tunnel. even through her weariness, she looks radiant under the christmas lights. she takes a long sip.}
<D>__{waitress [noticing he's shaken] hey, you ok?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{[beat] yeah, i'm fine.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{you know what? it's christmas eve. and you look clean i mean, you're normal looking. [resolutely, for her own benefit] it's christmas eve, and i have a couch.}
<A>__{and sadly, no plans for the evening anyway. she looks back her eyes even more tired from the liquor.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i'm not gonna hurt you. waitress [softly] i know. [clearing her throat] i'm gonna go take a bath. make yourself at home. you know, fix yourself something to eat if you're hungry or anything. there's nothing to steal, but don't be a jerk and take something anyway. and don't snoop, ok?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{ok. [beat] my name's william by the way. waitress [shakes her head] no, no. let's not do the name stuff, 'cause you see, i don't want to meet you. i may want to help you tonight, but i don't want to know you. honest.}
<A>__{starks nods as she walks out.}
