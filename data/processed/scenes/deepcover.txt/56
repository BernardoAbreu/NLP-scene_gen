<L>__{exterior betty's store day}
<A>__{elias and hull approach. hull's carrying a satchel and wearing a new leather jacket.}
<L>__{interior jewelry store day}
<A>__{as they go in, elias switches the open sign to closed and turns the latch. the store is filled with latin american folk art, particularly masks which line the walls. betty stone, the woman hull saw with elias at the bar, comes out from the back. she is 27, a bad girl trying to dress the way she thinks a banker who went to vassar dresses for success. she's also a little strung out. she and hull recognize each other at once, (a brief reprise of that moment of perfect chemistry) but she avoids his gaze.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{betty, this is john, my new associate.}
<C>__{mccutcheon}
<D>__{your new eddie. i hear the old one wore out.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{factory recall. john's going to be a good customer. he does a lot of wash.}
<A>__{hull puts the satchel on a display case. betty still won't look at him, opens the satchel, begins a quick count. she does this with a speed and sureness that suggests high test scores.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{so how's this place work?}
<A>__{betty doesn't answer, so elias covers the awkwardness.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{betty wires the money to a store in aruba in payment for things they never sent her. they deposit the money in a bank there that turns around and loans her money she never has to repay. that way it doesn't turn up as income for the irs. welcome to the laundromat.}
<C>__{mccutcheon}
<D>__{david, you talk too much.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{she doesn't trust you.}
<A>__{hull has taken down a mask, puts it over his face, looks in a mirror.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{how much is this?}
<C>__{mccutcheon}
<D>__{more than you can afford.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{i will take it.}
<A>__{she produces a vial of coke, looks questioningly at elias.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{by all means.}
<A>__{she draws out six lines. elias does two.}
<C>__{mccutcheon}
<P>__{(offering him the straw)}
<D>__{come on, eddie 2... you're up.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{no, thanks.}
<A>__{note: betty is acutely attuned to hull, and in his refusal she senses albeit unconsciously two things: first, that he doesn't trust himself on drugs, therefore, he's a dangerous guy and, therefore, exciting; and, second, more important, the refusal bespeaks a repudiation of the violence and danger and, thus, a longing for goodness. despite the seeming contradiction, she finds this even more attractive. but because she feels herself to be bad, his goodness seems only a judgment against her, and so she thinks she hates him.}
<C>__{mccutcheon}
<D>__{who is he, my mother?}
<C>__{hull}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{never have, never will.}
<A>__{betty ignores him, does her lines.}
<C>__{mccutcheon}
<P>__{(taunting hull)}
<D>__{oooh... cocaine, i love it and i hate it and i love it. the disease is the cure.}
<A>__{she can't help looking at hull who's looking at her. she and elias are stoned; he's not.}
<C>__{mccutcheon}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{don't look at me. elias, tell him not to look at me. i don't like the fucker.}
<A>__{but elias is too busy vacuuming up hull's leftovers.}
<C>__{elias}
<P>__{(sniffling)}
<D>__{john's an ascetic negro; he wants to make sure you know he's not a jungle bunny.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{watch your mouth, david.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{but he's got another side. you should seen him on the street the other day with these two usc kids. do the spade bit for her, john.}
<P>__{(black accent)}
<D>__{i'm gonna mess you up, muthafugga...}
<A>__{he sticks his finger in hull's face just like hull with the boys.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{don't call me a spade. and don't tell me to play black.}
<A>__{he says it gently, but betty hears the edge.}
<C>__{elias}
<P>__{(hurt, disappointed)}
<D>__{come on, john, you do it so well.}
<P>__{(falling into it)}
<D>__{ah ain't playin', muthafucka. ah ain't playin'.}
<A>__{hull glares; elias refuses to be intimidated.}
<C>__{elias}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{don't fuckin' dis me, muthafucka. fucka... fucka... fucka a... fucka b... fuck b hive... fucka, fucka, fucka...}
<A>__{elias dances around repeating "fucka" until it's almost musical. hull picks him up and slams into a wall.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{say it again, and i will kill you.}
<A>__{elias throws hull back against a display case. he's strong and unafraid. they're ready to fight.}
<C>__{mccutcheon}
<D>__{grow up, assholes!}
<A>__{this half snaps them out of it. still glowering, they slowly relax, release each other.}
