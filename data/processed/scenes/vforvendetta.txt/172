<A>__{the leader stares hard at helen.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i saw him, leader. in the middle of the night. i heard something. i went to the landing and that's when i saw it.}
<A>__{she clutches him.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{that mask. that hideous smiling mask.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{but how did you know it was heyer?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i know, leader. i know the way a woman knows.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{but you have no proof?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{proof?}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{yes, proof? this is an extremely delicate situation, mrs. heyer. it has been reported that the terrorist is dead. it would be a catastrophe to arrest a man now without concrete, conclusive proof. do you have any evidence at all?}
<A>__{tears well up in helen's eyes as she shakes her head.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{but if you're right, if heyer is indeed the terrorist...}
<A>__{his eyes fly wide and he spins away from her, throwing open the door.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{leader! wait!}
