<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{a mini bar being opened. a hand reaching in, extracting two small bottles of jack daniels whiskey and a bottle of seltzer.}
<L>__{interior nomad hotel room lower floor}
<A>__{the figure crosses the room, pouring the seltzer onto a towel. he kneels down, dabbing a spot on the carpet, fresh spill, deep red, indelible.. the seltzer doesn't bring it up. the stain remains, smeared now but unmistakable...blood. the figure stands. in the bathroom behind him, we see a body, male, late 50's, trussed up, hung by his feet over the tub and bled out. the figure walks in, takes a polaroid, turns it upside down near the man's face and fires off a photo. he crosses back into the bedroom. the resulting photo is tucked into the corner of a dresser mirror as it develops. as the figure sits, we pan over to reveal: lazlo soot: world class assassin slash master of disguise. the slowly developing polaroid depicts the same face that we now see in the mirror. soot touches up the putty and plastic appliances on his face, smoothing, sealing... he takes up a small micro cassette recorder, rewinds, pushes play. a butler's uniform, steamed and pressed, hangs on the door. he takes it down and begins changing into it.}

<D>__{ keep calm.}
<A>__{he glances over at the bed. the dead man's voice crackles back over the recorder.}

<C>__{lazlo soot }
<D>__{ say your name. then say "how can i be of assistance."}
<A>__{soot, back to the mirror, buttoning his collar, straightening his cuffs, smoothing out the creases.}
<C>__{dead man }
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{lazlo soot }
<D>__{i didn't ask for your understanding. i asked you to say your name, followed by the phrase "how can i be of assistance."}
<A>__{beat. soot looks down at the silencer fitted 9mm pistol lying on the vanity.}
<D>__{lazlo soot (on recorder) (cont'd) last chance.}
<A>__{a pause, then:}
<C>__{dead man }
<D>__{my name is vitoli. how can i be of assistance.}
<C>__{lazlo soot }
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{a muffled gunshot sounds. the recorder abruptly shuts off. soot, gazing at his reflection now, rewinds the recorder, replays, listens, gauging the man's vocal patterns rough baltic accent, throaty warble, excessive smoke & booze exposure, tracheal damage. tough to match. he rehearses one.}
<C>__{soot}
<D>__{my name is vitoli. how can i be of assistance.}
<A>__{he grimaces, grabs cigarettes off the bureau, lights, wails smokestack, puffing three at once, bellows like lungfuls he grabs an aerosol can from the same bureau, strafes the back of his throat, pops the tops on the bottles of jack, kills them both, gags, sputters, recovers, adjusts himself. suddenly, the phone begins to ring. soot stops, stares. after another ring, he lifts the receiver,}
<C>__{soot }
<P>__{(into phone, cautious)}
<D>__{this is vitoli. how can i be of assistance.}
<A>__{hugo croop's voice booms from the earpiece.}
