<L>__{exterior crack house night}
<A>__{one of the drug dealers stands outside the crack house as a car suddenly pulls up to the curb. he starts toward the car as the driver rolls down the window, but before he gets there, christy and several nuns surround the car.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{we're here to pray for you, brother.}
<C>__{dealer}
<D>__{what? get the hell out of here.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{we know you don't want to sell drugs. you just had an unhappy childhood, and maybe a learning disability. you just need someone to pray for you.}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<D>__{we know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. we'll pray to find you some honest work.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{and we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! we know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse. and so you truly need our prayers.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{what is this? outta my way!}
<A>__{the nuns give him room, and the driver zips off down the street. a small crowd has begun to gather, and it is growing by the moment, murmuring encouragement for the nuns. christy turns to the dealer, as other cars drive slowly past.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free we're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house.}
<C>__{mary robert}
<P>__{(to the dealer)}
<D>__{we're nuns!}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<P>__{(to cruising cars)}
<D>__{free prayers right over here! drive up and get your prayers!}
<C>__{dealer}
<D>__{you're hassling my customers! that's not legal! i know my rights. this is restriction of trade.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{you wanna call a cop?}
<A>__{the dealer's eyes turn ugly as he takes a gun from his pocket. mary patrick steps forward.}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<D>__{are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?}
<C>__{mary lazarus}
<D>__{is it worth it? a lot of witnesses here.}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(to the crowd)}
<D>__{can i get a witness?}
<A>__{the dealer glances at the surly crowd, then gives the nuns a disgusted look. he puts the gun away.}
<C>__{dealer}
<D>__{so i will find another neighborhood to do my business. you can' t stop me.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{if we can stop you here, they can stop you there.}
<A>__{the dealer turns and walks back to his house with anger. the crowd applauds and cheers. the picture suddenly becomes grainy, and we hear the voice of a news reporter.}
<C>__{news reporter }
<D>__{it was a truly remarkable scene, as the nuns from st. katherine's literally drove the crack dealers from the neighborhood, led by the feisty sister mary clarence.}
<A>__{camera pulls back and we see a tv screen with an image of the nuns and neighbors still celebrating. on top of the tv are several framed photographs of vince laflocca, his wife and children.}
