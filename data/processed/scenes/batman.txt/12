<L>__{exterior street that moment night}
<A>__{we pick up lt. eckhardt as he emerges onto the side street. he's headed for his car when he spies a stretch limo idling across the street. leaning on the hood, waving hi, is the dandyish jack napier flanked by two impressive goons. eckhardt throws a nervous glance back in knox's direction. he turns left, gestures to jack to meet him farther up the block. by the time he reaches the corner jack has swaggered up alongside him. eckhardt takes a fat brown envelope from jack and stuffs it quickly in his coat.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you didn't show up.}
<C>__{eckhardt}
<D>__{we had another bat sighting.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm sure that was vitally important. listen: things are heating up. someone is leaking information to harvey dent.}
<A>__{eckhardt bristles. there's no love lost between these two.}
<C>__{eckhardt}
<D>__{i'm doing the best i can. if it's a problem }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{eckhardt... our problems are your problems.}
<C>__{eckhardt}
<D>__{i will work on it.}
<A>__{jack reaches out and grabs eckhardt by the lapels of his topcoat an italian job, obviously expensive. he rubs the material between his fingers.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{very nice, lieutenant. but a little ostentatious on a cop's salary, don't you think?}
<C>__{eckhardt}
<P>__{(knocking his hands away)}
<D>__{i answer to grissom, punk. not to you.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you're a smart boy, eckhardt. you should be thinking about the future.}
<A>__{eckhardt laughs in his face.}
<C>__{eckhardt}
<D>__{ambition.}
<P>__{(nodding his head)}
<D>__{forget it, jack. you'll never run that organization.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{and why's that?}
<C>__{eckhardt}
<D>__{you're a psycho, friend. you're an a one crazy boy and grissom knows it.}
<A>__{jack lashes out and backhands eckhardt across the face. the fat cop, stunned, turns bright red and charges jack. jack claps a hand on eckhardt's face and shoves him back full force. the cop sprawls on his ass in the doorway of an all night cuban chinese restaurant. by now patrons are staring out of the restaurant windows. eckhardt is livid. his hand goes instinctively to his gun.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{here. use mine.}
<A>__{jack pulls an automatic from his pocket and tosses it in eckhardt's lap. he looks down and laughs, daring eckhardt to pick it up just as the two enormous goons from the stretch limo appear behind him for reinforcement. eckhardt wipes blood from his mouth as jack an a one crazy boy grin on his face reaches down for the gun.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{it's all right, boys. lt. eckhardt here is a good cop. a real good cop.}
<P>__{(pause; smiling)}
<D>__{inexpensive.}
