<A>__{a sleek british sports car talks directly to us in a pixilated, garbled video. he's out of breath. crates are visible behind him. we're in the shadowy bowels of a steel room.}
<C>__{leland turbo}
<D>__{this is agent leland turbo. i have a flash transmission for agent finn mcmissile.}

<C>__{leland turbo}
<D>__{finn. my cover's been compromised. everything's gone pear shaped.}
<A>__{superimpose over black: a pixar animation studios film}
<C>__{leland turbo}
<D>__{you won't believe what i've found out here.}
<A>__{he angles our camera view, reveals a porthole through which we can see flames rising in the distance.}
<C>__{leland turbo}
<D>__{this is bigger than anything we've ever seen. and no one even knows it exists. finn, i need backup. but don't call the cavalry it could blow the operation. and be careful. it's not safe out here!}
<A>__{angry voices o.s. time for turbo to go.}
<C>__{leland turbo}
<D>__{transmitting my grids now. good luck!}

<L>__{exterior somewhere in the north pacific night}
<A>__{a tiny crab boat (crabby) crests over massive swells.}
<C>__{crabby}
<D>__{alright buddy, we're here. right where you paid me to bring you. question is, why?}
<A>__{a metallic blue sports car, circa the `60s, emerges from the shadows. cagey, smooth, he'd turn heads driving through any intersection in the world. meet finn mcmissile.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{i'm looking for a car.}
<C>__{crabby}
<D>__{a car? hey pal, you can't get any further away from land than out here.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{exactly where i want to be.}
<C>__{crabby}
<D>__{well i got news for you, buddy. there's nobody out here but us.}
<A>__{suddenly, a horn a combat ship, the size of most cruise ships. finn quickly backs into the shadows, out of sight.}
<C>__{combat ship}
<D>__{what are you doing out here?}
<C>__{crabby}
<D>__{what does it look like, genius? i'm crabbing!}
<C>__{combat ship}
<D>__{well turn around and go back where you came from.}
<C>__{crabby}
<D>__{yeah? and who's gonna make me?}
<A>__{a laser sight hits crabby between the eyes.}
<C>__{crabby}
<D>__{alright, alright! don't get your prop in a twist.}
<P>__{(as he turns to leave)}
<D>__{what a jerk. sorry, buddy. looks like it's the end of the line. buddy?}
<A>__{on crabby's deck: finn is gone.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{finn he hangs off the side of combat ship, clandestine. we're with finn as the ship continues on, cuts through the darkness with purpose. suddenly small flames appear, perhaps a knot or so away. then whoosh!!! a flame rises above finn, the ship. it illuminates an oil derrick. thwap! finn fires a grappling hook to the derrick and swings toward it. he's going to slam into the side with brute force when his tires sprout a magnetic exoskeleton. he sticks to the derrick and now drives vertically up up up... from this vantage point, hundreds of derricks appear.}
<L>__{exterior platform oil derrick moments later}
<A>__{finn approaches a loading bay from above, hides. he watches as gremlins, pacers and assorted other cars scurry about.}
<C>__{finn }
<D>__{leland turbo, this is finn mcmissile. i'm at the rally pointerior over.}
<A>__{no response.}
<C>__{finn }
<D>__{leland, it's finn. please respond. over.}
<A>__{an access door opens loudly below. a boxy, monacle wearing german car enters. this is professor otto zundapp.}
<C>__{professor zundapp}
<P>__{(in german and english)}
<D>__{too many cars here. out of my way!}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{professor zundapp?}
<C>__{pacer }
<D>__{here it is, professor.}
<A>__{zundapp approaches a nosy pacer who idles next to a crate.}
<C>__{nosy pacer}
<D>__{you wanted to see this before we load it?}
<C>__{professor zundapp}
<D>__{ah, yes. very carefully...}
<A>__{a forklift opens the crate inside is a tv camera, packed carefully in foam. finn snaps photos furiously.}
<C>__{nosy pacer}
<D>__{oh. a tv camera. what does it actually do?}
<C>__{professor zundapp}
<D>__{this camera is extremely dangerous.}
<C>__{finn}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{what are you up to now, professor?}
<A>__{finn, angling for a better view, fires suspension wires which sail clear to the other side of the derrick thok! they hook tightly onto a steel girder. finn slides out onto the wire like an acrobat, then expels another cross wire for support.}
<C>__{professor zundapp}
<D>__{this is valuable equipment. make sure it is properly secured for the voyage.}
<C>__{nosy pacer}
<D>__{you got it.}
<A>__{finn lowers himself. he snaps more pictures.}
<C>__{grem }
<D>__{hey, professor z!}
<A>__{zundapp turns as a crane lowers a car sized crate. grem and acer, an orange gremlin and a green pacer, flank it.}
<C>__{grem}
<D>__{this is one of those british spies we told you about.}
<C>__{acer}
<D>__{yeah. this one we caught sticking his bumper where it didn't belong.}
<A>__{finn produces semi automatic guns from his side, readies himself for a tag team spy fight with his buddy leland.}
<C>__{professor zundapp}
<D>__{agent leland turbo.}
<A>__{the crate is lifted, revealing a crushed, cubed leland turbo. finn's eyes go wide. suddenly whoooshhh! another derrick flame rises behind him, casts a finn shaped shadow over the professor. he looks up.}
<C>__{professor zundapp}
<D>__{it's finn mcmissile! he's seen the camera! kill him!!}
<A>__{finn unloads with bullets as he starts to retreat he stops: bad guy cars are waiting for him on the catwalk where he just came from blowtorches ready. finn, stuck in midair, notices an angry crane. finn grins, having just found his escape. thwapthwapthwap!!! finn releases three of his four cables, swinging, indiana jones style on the last one toward the crane where he lands on its boom, drives up and launches off it where he lands moving onto another deck! finn now drives, spraying oil and screeching around corners. a gremlin in pursuit hits the oil patch, loses control and plummets off the side of the rig! the gremlin falls... it's like an eternity... he smashes into the water and breaks into a million pieces. on finn now set upon by 20 or 30 more pursuing cars. he has nowhere to go but up up up a ramp toward the helipad. he spies some gasoline barrels, fires a single bullet which cuts through its leather straps, sending barrels down the ramp, past finn past the pursuing cars to the bottom where they explode in a chain reaction back up the ramp, taking out at least 15 cars! on the helipad finn blasts into view, pulls to a stop. no more road. nowhere else to go. the 20 bad guy cars that are still in pursuit surround him, fire up their blowtorches. about to pounce. finn grins. the second time we've seen this grin. it means he's got something cooking. finn's reverse lights appear. he drives backward off the edge of the helipad to the shock of the other cars. finn falls. he turns himself so he's grill first, cleanly cutting into the water. he emerges, now sprouting hydrofoil and speeds away.}
<C>__{grem}
<P>__{(nonplussed)}
<D>__{get to the boats.}
<A>__{the boats an army of combat ships quickly drop into the sea and churn water with unprecedented fury as they quickly make up the distance between them and finn, firing bullets as they do so.}
<C>__{acer}
<D>__{he's getting away!}
<C>__{combat ship}
<D>__{not for long.}
<A>__{the lead combat ship quietly drops a torpedo into the water. it skips along, connecting with finn in his rear and exploding with such force that water skyrockets into the night clouds. underwater mcmissile sinks. then, he blinks. he grins. we're starting to like this grin and what follows it. he now converts into a submarine. from his trunk he releases four decoy tires which float to the surface like body parts. on the derrick professor zundapp watches it all from far away.}
<C>__{grem }
<D>__{he's dead, professor.}
<C>__{professor zundapp}
<D>__{wunderbar. with finn mcmissile gone, who can stop us now?}
<L>__{exterior radiator springs day}
<A>__{tow mater, a rusty tow truck, putters into view.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{mater. tow mater, that's who... is here to help you!}
<A>__{he approaches a broken down sedan on the side of the road. he drives around to the front, catching otis' face for the first time.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{hey, otis!}
<C>__{otis}
<D>__{hey, mater. gosh, i'm so sorry. i thought i could make it this time, but...}
<P>__{(he tries to start his engine, stalls)}
<D>__{smooth like pudding, huh? ah, who am i kidding? i will always be a lemon.}
<A>__{mater hooks his friend and starts towing him.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{well dadgum, you're leaking oil again. must be your gaskets. hey, look on the bright side: this is your tenth tow this month, so that means it's on the house.}
<C>__{otis}
<D>__{you're the only one that's nice to lemons like me, mater.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{don't sweat it. these things happen to everybody, otis.}
<C>__{otis}
<D>__{but you never leak oil.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{yeah, but i ain't perfect. don't tell nobody, but i think my rust is starting to show through.}
<A>__{mater and otis drive past the radiator springs welcome sign. it has been amended to say: "home of lightning mcqueen."}
<C>__{otis}
<D>__{hey, is lightning mcqueen back yet?}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{not yet.}
<C>__{otis}
<D>__{he must be crazy excited about winning his fourth piston cup. four! wow!}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{yeah, we're so dadgum proud of him. but i sure wish he'd hurry up and get back `cause we got a whole summer's worth of best friend fun to make up for. just me and }
<A>__{ahead of them, a half mile off, a red race car is visible.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{ mcqueen!}
<A>__{mater floors it, dragging poor otis behind him.}
<C>__{otis}
<D>__{uh, mater? i'm in no hurry. you don't need to go so fast!}
<A>__{boom! they hit a bump. otis catches air.}
<L>__{exterior radiator springs day}
<A>__{lightning mcqueen is surrounded by his hometown friends.}
<C>__{luigi}
<D>__{oh, lightning. welcome home.}
<C>__{flo}
<D>__{good to have you back, honey.}
<C>__{fillmore}
<D>__{congratulations, man.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{welcome home, soldier.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{the place wasn't the same without you, son.}
<C>__{lizzie}
<D>__{what? did he go somewhere?}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{it's good to be home, everybody.}
<C>__{mater }
<D>__{mcqueen!}
<A>__{they all turn around, see mater speeding into town, with otis swerving behind him.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{mater!}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{mcqueen!}
<A>__{mater skids into main street and in one swift motion, slingshots otis forward }
<C>__{otis}
<D>__{woaahhhhh!}
<A>__{ right through ramone's front door }
<L>__{interior ramone's continuous}
<A>__{ where he lands perfectly on the hydraulic lift. ramone lifts him up, routine.}
<C>__{ramone}
<D>__{hey. how far'd you make it this time, otis?}
<C>__{otis}
<D>__{halfway to the county line.}
<C>__{ramone}
<D>__{not bad, man.}
<C>__{otis}
<D>__{i know, i can't believe it either!}
<L>__{exterior radiator springs continuous}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{mcqueen, welcome back!}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{mater, it's so good to see you.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{you too, buddy.}
<A>__{mater and mcqueen do an elaborate tire bump (fist bump style).}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{oh, man. you ain't gonna believe the things i got planned for us.}
<A>__{everyone watches as the tire bump continues.}
<C>__{mack}
<P>__{(to lizzie, an aside)}
<D>__{these best friend greetings get longer every year.}
<C>__{mater}
<P>__{(to mcqueen)}
<D>__{you ready to have some serious fun?}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{well, actually i've got something to show you first.}
<L>__{interior radiator springs museum day}
<A>__{close on the piston cup. it has now changed, been adorned with a small likeness of doc. it says "hudson hornet piston cup."}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{wow. i can't believe they renamed the piston cup after our very own doc hudson.}
<A>__{mcqueen and mater are alone, the museum closed to the public. mcqueen approaches a "hudson hornet" wall with doc's three piston cups, framed articles, other racing ephemera.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{i know doc said these things were just old cups, but to have someone else win it just didn't feel right, you know?}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{well, doc would've been real proud of you. that's for sure.}
<A>__{mcqueen takes this in.}
<L>__{exterior radiator springs later}
<A>__{mcqueen and mater exit the doc hudson museum.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{alright, pal. i've been waiting all summer for this. what've you got planned?}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{you sure you can handle it?}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{come on, you know who you're talking to? this is lightning mcqueen. i can handle anything.}
<L>__{exterior radiator springs day}
<A>__{mater and mcqueen roll on an old train track, their tires off. they're on their rims.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{uh.... mater?!}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{just remember, your brakes ain't gonna work on these!}
<A>__{as they head into a dark tunnel }
<C>__{mcqueen }
<D>__{mater!}
<C>__{mater }
<D>__{relax, these train tracks ain't been used in years!}
<A>__{from inside the tunnel a loud train horn. the two friends emerge, going as fast as they can on train tracks, uphill, with no tires.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{come on, come on! faster, faster!}
<A>__{moments later a harmless galloping goose appears, oversized horn visible, cackling and laughing at his prank.}
<L>__{exterior field outside radiator springs later}
<A>__{an enormous earth mover sleeps. mcqueen and mater sneak up.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{this is gonna be good!}
<A>__{they blow their horns and he tips over, tractor tipping style. they laugh at the gag, but soon realize the earth mover's giant exhaust pipe is directly above them.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{uh oh. this ain't gonna be good.}
<A>__{the exhaust pipe belches. mcqueen and mater are blasted out of view.}
<L>__{interior radiator springs dusk}
<A>__{the sun sets. mcqueen and mater roll into town. mcqueen looks exhausted. mater is still full of energy.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{boy, this was the best day ever! and my favorite souvenir?}
<A>__{mater proudly shows off a dent.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{this new dent!}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{boy, mater. today was, uh...}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{shoot, that was nothing. wait til you see what i got planned for tonight.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{mater, mater. whoa. i was kind of thinking of just a quiet dinner.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{that's exactly what i was thinking.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{no, i... i meant with sally, mater.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{even better! you, me and miss sally going out for supper.}
<A>__{mcqueen pulls around in front of mater, stops.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{mater, i meant it would be just me and sally.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{it's just for tonight. we'll do whatever you want tomorrow.}
<C>__{mater}
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{thanks for understanding.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{yeah, sure. y'all go on and have fun now.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{alright, then. see ya soon, amigo!}
<A>__{mcqueen drives off. mater watches him go.}
<L>__{exterior the wheel well night}
<A>__{it's been converted into a white tablecloth restaurant, with cars dining al fresco and a hopping gastropub inside. mcqueen and sally have a prime table with a view of radiator springs and the starry night sky.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{this is so nice.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{i can't tell you how good it is to be here alone. just the two of us. finally, you and me }
<C>__{mater }
<D>__{good evening.}
<A>__{mater is at their table, dressed as a waiter.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{my name is mater and i will be your waiter.}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{mater the waiter. that's funny right there.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{mater, you work here?}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{well yeah i work here. what'd you think, i just snuck in here when nobody was looking and pretended to be your waiter, just so i could hang out with you?}
<A>__{mcqueen and sally exchange a look.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{oh, yeah. how ridiculous would that be?}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{now, can i start you two lovebirds off with a couple drinks?}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{yes. i will have my usual.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{you know what? i'm going to have that too.}
<A>__{mater blinks.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{uh, right. your usual.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{inside at the bar fillmore and sarge watch as guido mixes drinks, ala "cocktail." mater arrives.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{guido! what's mcqueen's usual?}
<C>__{guido}
<P>__{(in italian, subtitled)}
<D>__{how should i know?}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{perfect! give me two of `em.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{quiet! my program's on.}
<C>__{mel dorado }
<D>__{tonight on "the mel dorado show"!}
<A>__{on the bar tv "the mel dorado show," a cable talk show, begins with file footage of miles axlerod, a sleek suv.}
<C>__{mel dorado }
<D>__{his story gripped the world! oil billionaire miles axlerod, in an attempt to become the first car to circumnavigate the globe without gps, ironically ran out of gas and found himself trapped in the wild!}
<A>__{we see images of newspaper headlines, search crews.}
<C>__{mel dorado }
<D>__{feared dead, he emerged 36 days later, running on a fuel he'd distilled himself from the natural elements! since then he's sold his oil fortune, converted himself from a gas guzzler into an electric car, and has devoted his life to finding a renewable, clean burning fuel!}
<A>__{images of oil derricks torn down; miles axlerod getting converted to electric; lab scientists testing chemicals.}
<C>__{mel dorado }
<D>__{now he claims to have done it with his allinol.}
<A>__{images of fields, rivers, vegetables, and mountains all combining to form the allinol logo.}
<C>__{mel dorado }
<D>__{and to show the world what his new superfuel can do, he's created a racing competition like no other, inviting the greatest champions from around the globe to battle in the first ever world grand prix. welcome sir miles axlerod.}
<A>__{sir miles axlerod arrives, parks across from mel's desk.}
<C>__{miles axlerod }
<D>__{thank you, mel. it is very good to be here. now listen to me: big oil. it costs a fortune. pollution is getting worse. i mean, come on. it's a fossil fuel. fossil. as in dead dinosaurs. and we all know what happened to them. alternative energy is the future. trust me, mel, after seeing allinol in action at the world grand prix, nobody will ever go back to gasoline again.}
<C>__{mater}
<P>__{(to fillmore)}
<D>__{what happened to the dinosaurs, now?}
<C>__{mel dorado }
<D>__{and on satellite, a world grand prix competitor and one of the fastest cars in the world, francesco bernoulli.}
<A>__{across the screen: live from rome, italy. we meet formula race car francesco bernoulli.}
<C>__{francesco }
<D>__{it is an honor, signore dorado. for you.}
<C>__{mel dorado }
<D>__{miles, why not invite lightning mcqueen?}
<A>__{mater, collecting his drinks, looks up, half intrigued.}
<C>__{miles axlerod }
<D>__{of course we invited him. but apparently after a very long racing season he is taking some time off to rest.}
<C>__{francesco }
<D>__{lightning mcqueen would not have a chance against francesco!}
<A>__{mater doesn't like this.}
<C>__{francesco }
<D>__{i can go over 300 kilometers an hour! in miles that is like, uh... way faster than mcqueen.}
<C>__{mel dorado }
<D>__{let's go to the phones. baltimore, maryland, you're on the air.}
<C>__{caller }
<D>__{am i on? hello?}
<C>__{mel dorado }
<D>__{you're on. go ahead.}
<C>__{caller }
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{mel dorado }
<D>__{go ahead, caller.}
<A>__{dial tone.}
<C>__{mel dorado }
<D>__{let's go to radiator springs. you're on, caller.}
<C>__{mater's voice }
<D>__{yeah, that italian feller you got on there can't talk that way about lightning mcqueen. he's the bestest race car in the whole wide world.}
<A>__{fillmore and sarge look around. mater is visible in the back of the bar on an office phone.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{uh oh...}
<C>__{francesco }
<D>__{if he is, how you say "the bestest race car," then why must he rest, eh?}
<C>__{mater's voice }
<D>__{cause he knows what's important. every now and then he prefers just to slow down, enjoy life.}
<C>__{francesco }
<D>__{ah, you heard it! lightning mcqueen prefers to be slow! of course, this is not news to francesco. when i want to go to sleep i watch one of his races. after two laps i am out cold.}
<A>__{audible rxns from the bar. a crowd has been forming ever since mater started talking.}
<C>__{mater's voice }
<D>__{that ain't what i meant.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{mcqueen and sally they hear the commotion inside.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{hey, what's going on over there?}
<T>__{cut back to:}
<A>__{the bar sally and mcqueen push through the crowd, see that they're watching francesco on the television.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<P>__{(to sally)}
<D>__{oh, it's that italian formula car. his name is }
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{francesco bernoulli. no wonder there's a crowd.}
<A>__{when sally says his name, she enunciates each part, as if italian were her mother's tongue.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{wait, why do you know his name? and don't say it like that. it's three syllables, not ten.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{what? he's nice to look at. you know, open wheeled and all.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{what's wrong with fenders? i thought you like my fenders.}
<C>__{mater's voice }
<D>__{well let me tell you something else there, mr. san francisco }
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{mater?}
<C>__{mater's voice }
<D>__{mcqueen could drive circles around you.}
<C>__{francesco }
<D>__{driving in circles is all he can do, no?}
<C>__{mater's voice }
<D>__{no! i mean yes. i mean he could beat you anywhere, anytime, any track.}
<A>__{on mcqueen he looks at guido who gives a nod over to mater, turned away from the crowd, still on the phone.}
<C>__{francesco }
<D>__{mel, can we move on? francesco needs a caller who can provide a little more intellectual stimulation. like a dump truck.}
<A>__{on mcqueen. he doesn't like this at all.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{ha ha! that shows what you know. dump trucks is dumb.}
<A>__{suddenly, mater is yanked from the booth and replaced by mcqueen.}
<C>__{mcqueen }
<D>__{yeah, hi, this is lightning mcqueen. look, i don't appreciate my best friend being insulted like that.}
<C>__{francesco }
<D>__{mcqueen! that was your best friend? this is the difference between you and francesco. francesco knows how good he is. he does not need to surround himself with tow trucks to prove it.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{those are strong words from a car that is so fragile.}
<C>__{francesco }
<D>__{fragile!? he calls francesco fragile? not so fast, mcqueen!}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{"not so fast." what is that, your new motto?}
<A>__{francesco goes ballistic in italian. they cut his mic.}
<C>__{miles axlerod }
<D>__{well, this sounds like something that needs to be settled on the race course. what do you say, lightning mcqueen? we've still got room for one more racer.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{well, i would love to. the only thing is my crew's off for the season so }
<A>__{a sound o.s. mcqueen turns to see fillmore, sarge and luigi flank a tablecloth which is hanging off the bar. ramone backs away, having spray painted "team lightning mcqueen" on it. guido quickly uncorks three wine bottles.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{pit stop.}
<A>__{mcqueen turns back to the phone.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{you know what? they just got back. deal me in, baby. ka chow!}

<D>__{strategia? francesco needs no strategy, it's very simple. you start the race, wait for lightning mcqueen to choke, pass him, then win. francesco always wins. it's boring.}
