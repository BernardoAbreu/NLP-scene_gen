<A>__{fran and steve are the first to reach the entrance to the department store. steve falls immediately on the gate locks. peter pulls up to a screeching halt at the gate. he turns the cart in a full 180 so that roger is facing out toward the mall. steve fumbles with the second lock. peter faces the few zombies which are converging along the balcony. he lift his new super gun and stares through the scope. the gun roars eloquently. even its sound pronounces its power. the single shot rips cleanly through the centre forehead of one of the creatures. the man aims at another head. blam. another perfect kill. then a third. roger fires several times. fran stands ready at the roll gate. as stephen finishes with the final lock, the woman pushes against the cage and it starts up. steve stands, and the two roll the cage into the ceiling, but stephen is careful not to let it get out of his grasp. fran moves into the store and peter pulls the cart behind him. then steve, peter and fran pull the gate shut long before any of the advancing creatures reach the area.}
