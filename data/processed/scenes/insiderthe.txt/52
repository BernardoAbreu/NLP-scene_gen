<L>__{interior a kitchen area, cbs offices, new york day}
<A>__{we've entered mid scene... a monitor on a cart plays a 1 2 inch vcr of a c span broadcast. seven ceos of big tobacco... in front of a bas relief of the american eagle. each in turn swears nicotine is not addictive or he doesn't know anything about health risks, they're not sure, maybe, maybe not, etc....}
<C>__{lowell }
<D>__{he referred to this...the seven dwarfs...}
<C>__{mike wallace }
<D>__{what "seven dwarfs?"}
<C>__{lowell }
<D>__{the seven ceos of big tobacco... referred to this... said they should}
<A>__{be afraid of}
<D>__{him... i assume, afraid of what he could reveal.}
<P>__{(to staff lawyers)}
<D>__{now, you tell me. what does this guy have to say that threatens these people?}
<A>__{and, now, we see lowell, mike wallace and debbie deluca with two staff lawyers, mark stern and john harris, sitting around a workstation used as an improvised eating area. beyond them are the "60 minutes" offices, workstations, piles of material, television monitors hanging from the ceiling, all tuned to cbs programming...}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{hardly new news.}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{no shit.}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{mark stern}
<P>__{(re: video)}
<D>__{what that is is tobacco's standard defense. it's the "we don't know" litany: "addiction? we believe}
<A>__{not.}
<D>__{disease? we don't know. we take a bunch of leaves, roll 'em together. you smoke 'em. after that? you're on your own. we don't know."}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so...tells me nothing.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{besides, you'll never get what he's got.}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{john harris}
<D>__{because of this guy's confidentiality agreement, he is never gonna be able to talk to you.}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{that's not good enough. this guy is the top scientist in the number three tobacco company in america. he's a corporate officer. you never}
<A>__{get whistle blowers}
<D>__{from fortune 500 companies. this guy is the ultimate insider. he's got something to say; he wants to say it; i want it on "60 minutes."}
<C>__{john harris}
<D>__{doesn't matter what he wants .}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{am i missing something here?}
<C>__{john harris}
<D>__{what do you mean, mike?}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{he's got a corporate secrecy agreement? give me a break. this is a public health issue, like an unsafe airframe on a passenger jet or...some company dumping cyanide into the east river. issues like that? he can talk, we can air it. they've got no right to hide behind a corporate agreement.}
<P>__{(re: his coffee)}
<D>__{pass the milk...}
<C>__{john harris}
<P>__{(does)}
<D>__{they don't need the right. they've got the money.}
<C>__{mark stern}
<D>__{the unlimited checkbook. that's how big tobacco wins every time. on everything. they spend you to death. $600 million a year in outside legal. chadbourne parke. ken starr's firm, kirkland and ellis. listen. gm and ford, they get nailed after 11 or 12 pick ups blow up. right? these clowns have never...i mean ever...}
<C>__{john harris}
<D>__{not even once...}
<C>__{mark stern}
<D>__{...not even with hundreds of thousands dying each year from an illness related to their product...have ever}
<A>__{lost a}
<D>__{personal injury lawsuit. on this case, they'll issue gag orders, sue for breach, anticipatory breach, enjoin him, you, us, his pet dog, the dog's veterinarian... tie him up in litigation for ten of fifteen years. i'm telling you, they bat a thousand. every time. he knows that. that's why he's not gonna talk to you...}
<A>__{lowell's been quiet, thinking about something else... now...}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{we got a guy...who wants to talk but he's constrained.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what if he were "compelled"?}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<P>__{(eating)}
<D>__{oh, torture? great ratings.}
<C>__{mark stern}
<D>__{what do you mean compelled?}
<C>__{lowell}
<P>__{(seriously)}
<D>__{i mean compelled by a justice department, state courts, be a witness. that would cut through any confidentiality agreement, wouldn't it?}
<C>__{mark stern}
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{debbie deluca}
<D>__{what does that do?}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{what do you mean, what's it do?}
<C>__{debbie deluca}
<D>__{what i mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement?}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{because he has to reveal it in a court of law. it's on record, it's out. it's no secret anymore. so how can they restrain his speech or retaliate? it's out in the world...}
<C>__{mark stern}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{if you could engineer it into the court record, you might have something. they would have a helluva time trying to restrain his speech then, wouldn't they?}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{john harris}
<P>__{(still skeptical)}
<D>__{yeah, but what venue? and where does he get does he have killer attorneys?}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{i don't think he's got any attorneys.}
<C>__{mark stern}
<D>__{he's gonna need attorneys who aren't afraid of risking years of litigation. and millions of dollars of their own dough in legal costs...}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{what do you say, mike? what do you think?}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{even if he gets the defense team, will he go for it?}
