<A>__{the witch's green ball zooms through space, as earth appears in the distance. then another object comes into sight. getting closer we see that is is a modern winged rocketplane of no determinable nationality, soaring high above earth. the green meteorite passes, briefly bathing the rocketplane in its glow. the rocketplane banks sharply, then stabilizes. slowly the hatch doors in its belly open up, revealing the underside of an automobile suspended in the open hatch. hydraulic metal arms emerge, lowering the automobile out from the belly of the cruising rocketplane. we can see now that the car is a white, '59 corvette convertible. with a "thunk", the metal arms release the car, and as the rocketplane blasts away, the corvette begins its free fall to earth. as the car falls gracefully through space, the driver plays with the wheel, causing the corvette to bank smoothly one way, then the other. once his direction is stable, the driver clicks on the car radio and adjusts it through various channels, until he settles on one. with the music playing, the car falls closer and closer to earth, entering and emerging from the cloud cover over the atmosphere. in the heat of entry the vehicle's paint starts burning up. as he heads down over a deserted area, the driver begins his approach. touching down at breakneck speed, the smoking corvette bounces violently, every part straining at the repeated impact. the driver's face is expressionless as he jams the car into high gear and floors it, spinning the wheels in an attempt to translate downward momentum into forward motion. then he pops his drag chute to help slow down. tthis accomplished, the expressionless driver releases the chute, and speeds off down the road in a cloud of dust.}
