<T>__{lap dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior elysian room night}
<A>__{the quintet. as the dissolve clears, a clatter of polite applause greets the end of a previous number. camera is on the bandstand, moving smoothly through the group of five musicians as the rhythm of a new number is set up: first the leader (a guitarist) snaps his fingers, giving the tempo to...the bass, who "walks" with the beat, bringing in...the drums, which start a quiet, insistent wire brush background for...the cello and the flute, whose introductory phrases, set the stage for...}
<B>__{steve dallas}
<A>__{...the guitar, the leader again. it comes in after this short preamble with the first statement of melody. (the tune has a faint echo of significance because it is one of the themes of the film, already heard as a phrase in the background score of the title music.) camera lingers a moment on the guitarist, steve dallas. he is a youth of pleasant, intelligent appearance. he plays with the intent air of the contemporary jazz musician who takes his work very seriously indeed and affects a much greater interest in the music and his fellow musicians than in the listening audience.}
<B>__{sidney}
<A>__{a close shot. sidney has just entered the club, strolling into the vestibule near the entrance. he wears an expression of oddly unsuitable antagonism, as he looks forward...}
<B>__{dallas}
<A>__{seen in long shot from sidney's viewpointerior camera moves to include sidney in foreground again. he turns as he is accosted by rita, the cigarette girl of the club. she is a pert creature, attractive and not unaware of the fact.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{don't you ever get messages, eyelashes? i called you twice.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(irked)}
<D>__{i've been up to here. listen, honey, tell me something. you know susan hunsecker...?}
<P>__{(rita nods)}
<D>__{has she been in? i mean lately, in the last coupla days...?}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{you're sure. find out for me.}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(with a nod)}
<D>__{sidney, can i talk to you a minute?}
<A>__{rita wears an injured air. sidney, preoccupied with other worries, callously ignores it.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{is frank d'angelo around?}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{at the bar sidney...}
<A>__{but sidney has moved away from her. d'angelo he is at the bar, listening with satisfaction to the music, watching the performers and studying the audience. sidney comes up behind him. we see sidney's eyes flick from d'angelo towards the bandstand and back again. then, as he takes the stool next to d'angelo, he assumes a different manner, a sulky resentment. d'angelo sees sidney.}
<C>__{d'angelo}
<P>__{(to the bartender)}
<D>__{joe, give my nephew a drink.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(sullen)}
<D>__{your nephew doesn't want a drink.}
<A>__{d'angelo is still watching the quintet. the guitar can be heard again.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{shooting past d'angelo and sidney towards the bandstand.}
<C>__{d'angelo}
<D>__{that's a lollipop that, boy. the kid is only great.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{and with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, frank.}
<A>__{d'angelo looks quickly at sidney, sensing the undercurrent. then he turns his back on the musicians, remarking in a quiet tone.}
<C>__{d'angelo}
<D>__{went over to philly yesterday an' seen the folks...it's nice you send them the fifty a month...}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{see my mother?}
<C>__{d'angelo}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{i only had a few hours.}
<A>__{a glum moment. frank sips his highball: sidney lights a cigarette, animosity on his face.}
<C>__{d'angelo}
<D>__{thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(begrudgingly)}
<D>__{robard's my client. i did it for him and his club, not your boys.}
<A>__{frank again notes sidney's resentful manner. sidney looks towards the musicians.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{frank, i think maybe you lied to me.}
<C>__{d'angelo}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{looka, sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(looking towards steve)}
<D>__{you told me that your boy was washed up with susie hunsecker, didn't you?}
<C>__{d'angelo}
<D>__{yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge. and, frankly, i'm glad. for steve's sake, i'm glad, not yours. i manage these boys and i got their best interests at heart. steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(narrowly)}
<D>__{you told him that?}
<C>__{d'angelo}
<D>__{not in those exact words you know what a temper he's got.}
<A>__{a pause. sidney is thinking.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{when do these hot headed boys of yours go on the road?}
<C>__{d'angelo}
<D>__{coupla weeks. for eight weeks.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{that's a nice tour. all booked?}
<P>__{(frank nodding)}
<D>__{when was susie around here last?}
<C>__{d'angelo}
<D>__{four five nights ago. that's how i know the romance is off. also steve's in a very bad mood.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(abruptly)}
<D>__{listen, frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.}
<C>__{d'angelo}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{i don't like this threatening attitude. when it comes to it, what the heck is it your business what they do, this boy and girl...}
<B>__{rita}
<A>__{locating sidney, she comes up behind him. he turns away from d'angelo as she whispers to him. as she departs, sidney turns back.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{if you knew hunsecker as well as i did, you might understand why it's my business. maybe you're walking around blind, frank, without a cane.}
<A>__{sidney gets off his stool. casually, but to effect, he adds:}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{...and in case you didn't know it, susie hunsecker's out there on the back step right now.}
<A>__{he turns away, glancing towards steve on the bandstand behind him. d'angelo he looks disturbed.}
