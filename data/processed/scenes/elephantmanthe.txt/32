<A>__{small circus night we see the poster of the elephant man. bytes stands before it saying the last of the patter.}
<C>__{bytes}
<D>__{the result is plain to see. ladies and gentlemen... the terrible elephant man.}
<A>__{he raps twice with the walking stick and pulls the poster up. merrick is now extremely sick. he almost looks as if he is unable to stand. the audience, as always, is quite alarmed. bytes smiles and comes forward.}
<C>__{bytes}
<D>__{turn around!}
<A>__{merrick looks incapable of even this simple movement, but he slowly manages to turn. the crowd reacts to the horrible condition of merrick's back and head. bytes satisfied that the elephant man is having the proper effect, raps the walking stick again.}
<C>__{bytes}
<D>__{dance!}
<A>__{merrick's eyes look painfully up to the heavens and he begins to shuffle clumsily about the platform. without his stick this is very difficult for him, causing him great pain. it is a humiliating spectacle and the crowd unimpressed by the halting movements of the monster begins to heckle him. bytes seeing that the dancing isn't being received well moves to place a stool next to merrick.}
<C>__{bytes}
<P>__{(rapping)}
<D>__{up! up!}
<A>__{merrick, already exhausted by his little dance, wheezes and coughs, attempting to ascend the stool. it is useless, he is just too tired. again the audience shouts its disapproval, booing and hissing the elephant man. bytes curses and raps again, demanding obedience from merrick who again bravely tries to mount the stool. he cannot do it! bytes, striving to save the moment and please the angry crowd, goes to merrick and roughly helps him up. merrick teeters precariously on the stool. bytes raps the stick.}
<C>__{bytes}
<D>__{give the call of the elephant!}
<A>__{merrick hesitates and bytes bangs the stick on the wagon. the audience quiets down to hear the elephant call. merrick senses this lull, but he is very frightened and sick. he lifts his head wearily and makes a few wavering cries that sound very little like an elephant.}
<C>__{bytes}
<D>__{louder!}
<A>__{merrick tries again but there is no improvement. the crowd begins to jeer at merrick, exhorting him to make the call of the elephant. merrick is now almost swaying on the stool. he attempts to step down, but as he does it finally becomes too much for him and he collapses into a heap on the wagon floor. the crowd is no longer in the least bit challenged by this piteous mess and they break out into a vocal fury, throwing objects at the wagon. bytes is humiliated at first, and then is quickly angry. he turns to merrick.}
<C>__{bytes}
<D>__{get up you miserable bastard!}
<A>__{but merrick just lays there moaning and wheezing irregularly.}
<C>__{bytes}
<D>__{i said, get up!}
<A>__{he jabs merrick a few times with the silver tipped walking stick. the crowd jeers even louder still. there is a clap of thunder.}
<C>__{bytes}
<P>__{(realizing it's no use)}
<D>__{i'm beatin' a dead horse.}
