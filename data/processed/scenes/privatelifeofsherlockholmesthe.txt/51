<A>__{holmes and watson are walking toward 221b. holmes is whistling 'loch lomond.'}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{you will be gentle, won't you, when you tell her you're dropping the case?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{watson, what does the word glennahurich suggest to you?}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{absolutely nothing.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{it's scottish.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{is it?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{and like all scottish names, it's really a word picture. glen means valley, na means of the, and hurich, if memory serves me, means yew tree.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{you're just trying to impress me.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{so the three boxes go to the valley of the yew tree.}
<A>__{he resumes whistling. they start to cross the street, skirting a parked hansom. feeding the horse is the same cabbie who fished gabrielle out of the river, and in the passenger seat is von tirpitz, the craggy faced prussian we saw before. he stares fixedly after holmes and watson. holmes and watson come up to the door of 221b, and watson fishes his key out. holmes is still whistling.}

<D>__{you are dropping the case, aren't you, holmes?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{open the door.}
<A>__{watson turns the key in the lock, starts to open the door, but is stopped by a chain on the inside. through the opening a revolver appears, aiming at them point blank.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{don't shoot, mrs. hudson you're liable to lose two excellent tenants.}
