<L>__{interior bedroom the next morning}
<A>__{leopold awakens alone in his room. he sits up with a jolt. his stomach sinks as he realizes this is no dream. he slowly rises to his full stature, moving to the window he looks out on the modern day city, shaking his head in awe. he makes his way to the bedroom door and tentatively touches the knob. there is a knock on the door. leopold jumps back and runs to the bed: the picture of dignity.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{how are you feeling?}
<P>__{(no response)}
<D>__{i thought you might like some tea.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i insist on being returned home immediately.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i understand. we're doing our best.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i wish to speak with your employer, dr. coles.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{you're speaking to him.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{you are not suggesting that you are dr. coles?}
<A>__{she smiles.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{miss... uh?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{dr. coles. if you like, you could call me miss dr. coles or if that's too much, how about just plain kate?}
<C>__{leopold}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{a woman of science?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{hard to believe?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{but a woman's brain cannot obtain enough knowledge to posses a truly scientific mind.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(jotting this down)}
<D>__{interesting. nevertheless, we've come a long way baby.}
<C>__{leopold}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{are you attempting to be humorous?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i'm attempting to be informative it's just coming out humorous.}
<A>__{leopold regards her dubiously.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(clinically)}
<D>__{look, modern social science clearly states that a woman's place in society marks the level of that civilization. a science career for a woman is now almost as acceptable as being a... a... waitress. cream and sugar?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{young lady, i... surely it is not expected that i remain here with you indefinitely... unchaperoned?}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(pen poised)}
<D>__{does that make you nervous?}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{certainly not!}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(writing)}
<D>__{then what are you getting so red about? it's a very large apartment... with locks on all the doors.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{the idea! my dear miss coles...}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{dr. coles.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{honey...}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(she puts the pad down)}
<D>__{let's get one thing straight right now. my name is kate or katherine or if you insist dr. coles.}
<P>__{(she rises)}
<D>__{take a good long look, leopold. i am a 20th century american woman with a doctorate and a commission and independence. i am not your "young lady" or your "pretty miss" or your "honey." is that clear?}
<A>__{leopold watches her with great interest. finally:}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{honey... for the tea.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{...i will get it for you.}
<A>__{kate grabs the teacup grandly and leaves the room.}
