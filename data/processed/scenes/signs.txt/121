<C>__{tv anchor}
<D>__{tel aviv joins nairobi, lagos and jerusalem as the latest to confirm the appearance of lights. there are lights in the skies over an estimated two hundred and seventy four cities. that total could be as high as four hundred within the hour.}

<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{you know about signs morgan? not like the ones people write on. it's like if you poured a glass of milk and you dropped the glass by mistake and broke it before you could drink it. then you looked at the milk carton and saw that the milk was spoiled. they're things that happen by chance or luck, but make you feel that someone's watching out for you.}
<A>__{the children think it over. beat.}
<C>__{morgan}
