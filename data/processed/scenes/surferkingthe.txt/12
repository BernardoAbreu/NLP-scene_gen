<L>__{ext day hill area above thunder bay}
<A>__{the entire staff of water world is assembled for a pre opening pep talk from owner big mike maxwell. he wears a water world golf shirt, shorts and a crew style marine hat. standing next to him is richard thompson, head lifeguard. the workers are sitting on the hill. aokee, the colonel and other "management" types are standing off to the side. tiffany and her friends are sitting up front. alex and robbie are sitting together towards the back, and robbie's grounds t shirt is no longer in his hand, but has been replaced by a folded aokee's blue hawaiian shirt. there is a lot of noise from everyone talking.}
<C>__{big mike}
<P>__{(motioning to get everyone to settle down)}
<D>__{okay, everybody, let's quiet down for a minute.}
<P>__{(they do, and he looks down at his clipboard)}
<D>__{for those who don't know me, my name is michael maxwell, and i...sort of run things around here.}
<A>__{a chant starts up, with affection...}
<C>__{everyone together}
<D>__{big mike! big mike! big mike!}
<A>__{big mike smiles, this has happened before, probably a tradition.}
<C>__{big mike}
<P>__{(again motioning to settle down)}
<D>__{okay, yeah thanks. now, i want go over a few basic things. first of all, make sure you've all filled out your paperwork with personnel, cause nobody gets paid unless they do. come to think of it, i suppose it's better for me that you don't fill out your paperwork, then i don't have to pay you. i will make it optional. if you want to get paid, fill out your paperwork.}
<P>__{(looking at clipboard)}
<D>__{let's remember, the people who come here are our guests, and your job is to see they have a safe and fun experience here. let's work together to keep the park clean and safe, and we'll have a great summer together. now with a few words is our head lifeguard, richard thompson.}
<A>__{another cheer starts up, smaller this time, which alex starts.}
<C>__{smaller group}
<D>__{big dick! big dick big dick!}
<C>__{richard}
<P>__{(wincing some, but not}
<D>__{surprised, motioning to settle}
<P>__{down)}
<D>__{yeah, yeah, very funny, we're all very amused. okay, many of you have been in training for some time, and some of you still have a ways to go...}
<A>__{we see a quick shot of some geeky younger guards wearing water wings, sharky goggles and noseplugs and looking less than confident...}
<C>__{richard }
<P>__{(glancing at the water wing}
<D>__{group wistfully, almost to}
<P>__{himself)}
<D>__{...a long ways to go...}
<A>__{he looks down at his clipboard.}
<C>__{richard }
<D>__{...but i'd like to take a moment to speak, mostly to the guards, but certainly everyone has a role in this. we can take everything we've learned and distill it down to two simple rules. rule number one:}
<A>__{he pauses, thoughtful for a moment, but building into a near rage for effect to impress on everyone...}
<C>__{richard }
<P>__{(loudly, emphatically, angry at}
<D>__{the thought that anybody}
<P>__{might...)}
<D>__{don't drown!}
<A>__{he stops, composing himself.}
<C>__{richard }
<P>__{(almost quietly)}
<D>__{rule number two:}
<A>__{again, thoughtful but building to a rage at the thought that this could happen...}
<C>__{richard }
<P>__{(loudly, emphatically)}
<D>__{don't let anyone else drown!}
<A>__{he stops again, and regains his composure.}
<C>__{richard }
<P>__{(almost quietly to the stunned crowd)}
<D>__{thank you. have a great summer!}
<A>__{there is stunned silence for a moment. they're not sure how to react.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(breaking the silence)}
<D>__{alright! whoo whoo!}
<A>__{alex, then everyone begins applauding. robbie looks at alex quizzically, alex just shrugs. the meeting breaks up.}
