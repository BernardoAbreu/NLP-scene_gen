<L>__{exterior village ditch day}
<A>__{in a ditch running alongside the village, partially concealed by foliage and anthills, tony, morehouse, and the ubiquitous bunny have a 12 year old vietnamese girl pinned to the ground, gagged and squirming, naked. they are fucking her to death. junior looks on, both curious and disgusted, but doesn't take part.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{take her up the ass ...}
<A>__{as they roll her over, like excited dogs in heat. chris, coming up, sees their heads dipping up and down on the other side of the anthill, knows what they're doing. he makes a conscious decision to do something. he runs over.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{let her go! you hear me! you asshole! let her go!}
<A>__{he strides right into them, shoves them off hard. the girl is in tears.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{what the fuck you want she's a dink.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{no you stupid fuck ... don't ... don't ... you too bunny. morehouse. off! no! don't ... don't!}
<A>__{he seems disconnected, dazed by the sun, like he's talking to dogs loud, repetitive words coming out of an anger he can barely control, trying to restore some sanity to a world gone totally nuts today. don't they understand? don'tthey have any sense of a mind? any kind of decency? the men looking at him as if he's the one who's gone nuts, not them. bunny looking at morehouse looking at tony looking at junior. the irony is lost on them, as chris pushes through to help the poor girl put her scanty clothes back on.}
<C>__{chris }
<P>__{(to the girl)}
<D>__{it's okay ... it's okay ...}
<A>__{elias appears behind bunny and the others, sees what's happened. he signals them to move out.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{get outta here.}
<A>__{the men grumble and slink off quietly. elias watching as... chris helps her to her feet, wounded in the intestines, she can barely stand, blood saoking in her nether regions. chris slings her up as gently as he can and carries her.}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(as if to himself)}
<D>__{it's okay, it's okay ...}
