<D>__{diane, it's 4:20 in the afternoon. i am standing here at wind river where they found the body of teresa banks. diane, this case has got a strange feeling for me. not only has agent chester desmond disappeared but this is one of cole's blue rose cases. the clues that were found by agent desmond and agent stanley have lead to dead ends. the letter below the fingernail gives me the feeling that the killer will strike again. but like the song says, "...who knows where or when".}
