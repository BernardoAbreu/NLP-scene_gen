<L>__{interior pantry night}
<A>__{it's a good sized one. in the b.g., the caterers are packing dishes, glassware, etc. margo crosses to a cupboard. she finds the bicarb.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{here you are, maxie dear. one good burp and you'll be rid of that miss caswell...}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{the situation i'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. i made a promise...}
<C>__{margo}

<C>__{margo}
<D>__{well, if she can act, she might not be bad. she looks like she might burn down a plantation...}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(mixing)}
<D>__{i feel right now like there's one burning in me.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{when's the audition?}

<C>__{margo}
<D>__{not at all. and you could do me a big favor, if you would }

<C>__{margo}
<D>__{you get quick action, don't you?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{margo, i wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{you said yourself my inventory was in good shape all of my merchandise put away. to keep her here with nothing to do i'd be standing in her way... and you need her, max.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{but what could she do?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{she'd be a great help read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure }
<C>__{max}
<D>__{well...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{think of your health, max more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track...}

<A>__{he goes out. a pause.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{who's left out there?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{too many. and you've got a new guest. a movie star from hollywood.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{shucks. and my autograph book is at the cleaners.}
<A>__{another pause.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{you disapprove of me when i'm like this, don't you?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{not exactly. sometimes, though, i wish i understood you better.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{when you do, let me in on it.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{i will.}
<A>__{another pause.}

<D>__{how's the new one coming?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{the play? all right, i guess...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{"cora." she's still a girl of twenty?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{twentyish. it isn't important.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{don't you think it's about time it became important?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{how do you mean?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{don't be evasive.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{margo, you haven't got any age.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{miss channing is ageless. spoken like a press agent.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{i know what i'm talking about, after all they're my plays...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{spoken like an author.}
<P>__{(abruptly)}
<D>__{lloyd, i'm not twentyish. i am not thirtyish. three months ago, i was forty years old. forty. four oh.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{that slipped out, i hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. now i feel as if i'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{... as young as they want, you mean. and i'm not interested in whether thousands of people think i'm six or six hundred }
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{just one person. isn't that so?}
<P>__{(margo doesn't answer)}
<D>__{you know what this is all about, don't you? it has very little to do with whether you should play "cora" it has everything to do with the fact that you've had another fight with bill.}
<A>__{a pause. margo closes the box of bicarb.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{bill's thirty two. he looks thirty two. he looked it five years ago, he'll look it twenty years from now. i hate men.}
<P>__{(she puts the box down)}
<D>__{don't worry, lloyd. i will play your play. i will wear rompers and come in rolling a hoop if you like... let's go say good night.}
<A>__{they exit into the dining room. as they open the swinging door, the camera remains in the doorway. margo and lloyd walk toward the stairs. in the b.g., eve is talking to the group. how much she says is dependent on how long it takes margo and lloyd to reach her.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(in the b.g.)}
<D>__{imagine... to know, every night, that different hundreds of people love you... they smile, their eyes shine you've pleased them, they want you, you belong. anything's worth that.}
<A>__{just as before, she becomes aware of margo's approach with lloyd. she scrambles to her feet...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{don't get up. and please stop acting as if i were the queen mother.}
<A>__{and as margo speaks or before we}
