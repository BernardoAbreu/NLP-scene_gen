<A>__{bond, wade and the captain.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{ nice trick with the arrest. very convincing.}
<C>__{captain morton}
<D>__{it's no trick, mr. wade. i've got half a mind to throw both of you in the brig.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{don't you think you're overreacting?}
<C>__{captain morton}
<P>__{(with great sarcasm)}
<D>__{yes. the famous james bond. i've heard all about you, sir. you were under direct orders to act as an observer and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half assed cia cowboy }
<P>__{(wade reacts)}
<D>__{endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide.}
<C>__{bond}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{...that's all well and good, captain, save for one thing:}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{there's no gold down there.}
<C>__{captain morton}
<D>__{what are you talking about? we went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{yes, the ship is down there. but the gold is gone.}
<C>__{captain morton}
<D>__{that's absurd! it took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{i know what i saw }
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{i don't care what you think you saw. you're a damned amateur.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{just get off my ship. go back to your trench coats and your code names and leave the job to professionals.}
<C>__{bond}
<P>__{(exchanges a glance with wade, then)}
<D>__{aye aye, captain.}
