<A>__{he slips into a cardigan sweater. his vanity is restricted entirely to how well pressed and clean everything is he wears. he goes out of the dressing room toward the kitchen, passing lorna on the phone in the living room and felicia at dining room table, hair in curlers, reading cosmopolitan magazine.}

<D>__{what?}
<C>__{felicia}
<D>__{that you were just indulging me.}
<C>__{lester}
