<A>__{we see benjamin lying on the floor by the stairs playing with some metal army men... when mr. oti's distinctive laugh, his voice, drifts up from under the stairs... benjamin, getting his canes, goes to look... mr. oti, standing under the stairs in an alcove with some of the help, telling them his life story... but it's a completely different tone... a mockery of white people and their insanity...}

<D>__{the big white man brings us to st. louis, where they make our village at the 1904 world's fair... they have us livin' in these little huts like we're livin' in africa... people behind bars staring at us... we told not to look at them... to just go about our normal lives... what the hell they talkin' about... ?}
<A>__{they all laugh...}
<C>__{ngunda oti }
<D>__{at night we're done bein' "savages..." we go over the wall into the rosebud... we drank and laughed until the sun come up... and then we savages again...}
<A>__{they nod enjoying the idea... and as mr. oti senses benjamin's presence, turning... benjamin retreating on his canes as fast as he can back up the stairs...}
