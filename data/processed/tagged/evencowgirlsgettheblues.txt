<C>__{delores}
<D>__{my sacred crocodile! she's flipped.}
<A>__{but in a minute, others follow debbie, everyone of them, in fact; the entire bunkhouse load of them, some thirty young cowgirls, squealing, giggling, they slide and roll on the wet grass, push each other into the mud that is forming by the corral fence, chase one another in and out of the thick folds of rain draperies, stamp their cute feet in puddles and do bellyflops into the overflowing horse trough. the cowgirls frolic until, as suddenly as it has come, the rain goes away. play ceases. they are panting like puppies as they lean against one another or pick clods of mud from one another's hair.}

<L>__{interior hotel lobby night}
<A>__{in the lobby, the doors of an elevator open revealing sissy inside wearing a buttoned up dress. very formal looking for her. there is julian standing in the lobby. he turns and walks toward sissy. he is wearing a rather formal looking plaid sport coat with blue cummerbund. he extends his hand to meet her, and (perhaps at the sight of sissy's thumbs) julian has an asthma attack, doubling over in front of her. sissy doesn't know whether to assist julian or flee. from the other side of the lobby, two well groomed couples, white, mid thirties and upper middle class come to the rescue. the younger of the men, rupert, takes charge. he breaks an inhaler of dinephrine under julian's nose.}
<C>__{rupert}
<D>__{we'd better take you home.}
<A>__{in the red of embarrassment, julian looks more indian than he had previously. wheezing, he speaks:}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{i beg your pardon. i've been enthralled with your photographs for years. when the countess hinted that you might like to meet me he never explained why i was ready to paint for him free of charge. and now i had to go and spoil it.}
<L>__{exterior street night}
<A>__{rupert is helping julian to the street. rupert is a salesman for a publishing house. his wife carla, a homemaker, as they say. the other couple breaks down into howard and marie barth, both copywriters for an ad agency. howard hails a cab and carla and marie flutter around sissy.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{this is dreadful.}
<P>__{(lowering her voice confidentially)}
<D>__{you know, asthma attacks are brought on by emotional stress. poor julian is so high strung. the excitement of meeting you my dear, you look so stunning! must have upset his chemical balance.}

<D>__{come on, sissy, don't be afraid of us.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{i've never ridden in a cab. the whole idea of paying for a ride makes my thumbs hurt.}

<D>__{it'll be all right, dear. it isn't as serious as it sounds.}
<L>__{interior cab night}
<A>__{carla starts to pat sissy's hand, then decides to leave the thumbs to themselves. the six of them are squeezed into the taxi. sissy looks out the window of the taxi: sissy's view as the taxi stops at a light, she can see a newsstand headline on the front page of the new york daily news: the chink sums it up, says life is hard if you think it's}

<D>__{there, that ought to beat them bronchial buggers into submission.}
<A>__{he turns to sissy.}
<C>__{rupert}
<D>__{i was a medic in the army. i really should have become a doctor. sometimes, though, i feel that pushing books is a whole lot like pushing medicine. think of books as pills. i have pills that cure ignorance and pills that cure boredom. i have pills to elevate moods and pills to open people's eyes to the awful truth...}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{too bad you don't have a pill for bullshit.}

<C>__{carla}
<D>__{rupert, before you get too engrossed in your research on scotch as a cure for aging, don't you think you'd better phone elaine's and cancel our dinner reservations?}
<A>__{sissy leaves her chair and wanders about the apartment. which is full of books and shelves.}
<C>__{rupert }
<D>__{what would we do without you, carla? without our little efficiency expert, carla, everything would just go to hell. carla is thinking about running for mayor next year, aren't you, carla?}
<C>__{carla }
<D>__{up yours, herr doktor book salesman. will the demands of your medical practice allow you to call elaine's or shall i?}

<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{no indian blankets... no indian blankets...}
<A>__{and she blacks out. and the sound drifts away in waves, so there is only the whistle of a distant wind through the mortar of the apartment building... ...until one by one, we see button necks freed. soon sissy can feel it. someone is undressing her. in a voice webby with sleep she lifts her head up, and sees howard and marie.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{where are the others?}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{oh, rupert and carla had a little hassle and went home.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{julian fell asleep on the couch; we covered him up.}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{we thought that we should make you comfortable too.}
<A>__{sissy thinks this is nice, but wonders, however, why they are both in their underwear.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{yes, thanks...}
<A>__{between the two of them, they have gotten sissy out of her dress in no time. sissy feels she should apologize for not having on a brassiere. marie slips out of her own brassiere and moves her bare bosom close to sissy's.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{mine are fuller but yours are more perfectly shaped.}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{highly debatable. i will wager they're the exact same size.}
<A>__{howard cups his left hand about a marie breast and his right about one of sissy's. he weighs them in his palms, squeezes them the way an honest grocer squeezes excess water from a lettuce, and spreads his fingers to sample their circumference.}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{hmm. yours are larger, marie, but miss hankshaw's sissy's are more firm. you'd think they would have started to droop; i mean, from not wearing a bra.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{howard! watch your manners. you've made her blush. here, sissy, let me compare.}
<A>__{marie seizes sissy's free breast, quickly, like a monkey picking a fruit, rolling it about in her hungry little finger, rubbing it against her chin and cheeks... ...and... ...it was like her earlier days as a hitchhiker.... nostalgic..... tropical plums.}
<C>__{sissy}
<P>__{(in ecstasy)}
<D>__{this place is finer than the place i live!}
<A>__{like a disc jockey from paradise, howard flips marie over and plays her b side. every now and then she reaches for sissy to include her, but the laws of physics insist on being obeyed. over and over marie calls sissy's name with half closed eyes. the barths are really going at it, marie yowling like a cat. the poodle in the kitchen begins to growl.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{so this is what it's like... so this is what it's really like.}
<L>__{interior living room night}

<P>__{(with downcast eyes)}

<C>__{julian}

<D>__{why? why do you have to go?}
<C>__{sissy}
<P>__{(somewhat frantic)}
<D>__{my thumbs hurt. i've made a mistake. i've been negligent. i haven't exercised. i have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. it's like a musician practicing his scales. when i don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore.}

<A>__{the countess is on the phone.}

<C>__{julian}
<D>__{extraordinary!}
<C>__{the countess}
<D>__{she's obviously that. jesus! which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of sissy's thumbs full of pennies?}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{oh, you! i'm not talking about her hands. they're difficult to ignore, i confess, but i'm speaking of her whole being. her whole being is extraordinary. the way she talks, for example. she's so articulate.}
<C>__{the countess}
<D>__{it's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to radcliffe or smith in order to speak the english language.}

<D>__{ninety degrees to the left, i hope. how does she feel about you?}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{i think she's disappointed that i'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. she's got some naive, sentimental notions about indians. i'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.}
<C>__{the countess}
<D>__{she always leaves town, you dummy. that doesn't mean anything. what about in bed? how does she like it in bed?}
<A>__{julian pauses for a very long moment.}

<D>__{whose fault was that?}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{i suppose it was mine. yes, it definitely was my fault.}
<C>__{the countess}
<D>__{what do they do to you boys in those ivy league schools, anyway? strap you down and pump the nature out of you? they can even press the last drop of nature out of a mohawk buck. why, send a shaman or cannibal to yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a neil simon comedy. jesus h.m.s. christ! if harvard or princeton could get hold of the chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the bow tie wing of the hall of wimps. oogie boogie.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{if we ivy leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'chink.' next thing i know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'}

<C>__{julian}
<D>__{what guy?}
<C>__{the countess}
<D>__{aw, he's some old fart holyman who lives in the hills out west. gives my ranch the creeps and the willies, too. but though he be old and dirty, he's alive, i will bet, clear down to his toes. they don't have his juice in a jar in new haven. well i suppose that i will have to write sissy out on the road.}
<L>__{exterior road day}
<A>__{sissy makes little puffs of dust as she walks. from the direction of the ranch a vw microbus is approaching. it is painted with mandalas, lamaistic dorjes and symbols representing "the clear light of the void." when the microbus draws alongside sissy it stops. inside are two men and a woman. they are approximately twenty four years old.}

<D>__{that's good. because he won't see you. we came all the way from minneapolis to see him and the crazy bastard tried to stone us to death}
<C>__{other man}
<D>__{yeah, but i no longer believe that guy's a master. he's just a dirty, uptight old mountain man. why, he pulled out his pecker and shook it at barbara. i'd stay away from there if i were you, lady.}

<A>__{gloria nods at sissy amicably but doesn't make a move to help her. sissy swings her sack into the roomy vehicle. before she gets in she flashes her thumb to hitch a ride. the instant that sissy shuts the door the cowgirl chauffeur floors the cadillac and it lurches away in a puff of dust.}

<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{no, i'm afraid that part isn't true. jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. we spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. besides, i always travel alone.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. the beatnicks were before my time, and i never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, cliches and the clap. but the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.}

<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{tell me about it.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{about...}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{about being a cowgirl. what's it all about? when you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{cowgirls exist as an image. a fairly common image. the idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. otherwise, they're being fooled. in the rodeo hall of fame in oklahoma city there are just two cowgirls. two. and both of 'em are trick riders. trick riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. that's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'}

<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{learned from the chink? oh my. ha ha. that's hard to say. we mostly.... uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy.}
<A>__{jelly pauses.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{oh yeah, now that i think of it, the chink taught me something about cowgirls. did you realize that cowgirls have been around for many centuries? long before america. in ancient india the care of the cattle was always left up to young women they called gopis. being alone with the cows all the time, the gopis got awfully horny, just like we do here. every gopi was in love with krishna, a good looking young god who played the flute like it was going out of style when the moon was full, this krishna would play his flute by a river and call the gopis to him. then he would multiply himself sixteen thousand times one for each gopi and make love to each one the way she most desired. there they were, sixteen thousand gopis balling krishna on the river bank, and the energy of their merging was so great that it created a huge oneness, a total union of love, and it was god. wow! quite a picture, huh?}

<D>__{what is debbie's position?}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. she says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the new age. she's a real dreamer, that debbie dear.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{you don't agree with debbie, then?}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{i wouldn't say that. i expect she's right, ultimately. but i'm with delores when it comes to fighting for what's mine. i can't understand why delores is so uptight about the chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two. ee! that grass tickles, doesn't it? god knows i love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. still this is cowgirl territory and i will stand with delores and fight any bastards who might deny it. i guess i've always been a scrapper. look. this scar. only twelve years old and i was felled by a silver bullet.}
<A>__{jelly takes sissy's hand, carefully avoiding the thumbs and helps her feel the depression in her belly. the depression is a dimple, like another navel. after a hungry stillness, like intermission at a wolf dance, rhythms are established. jelly and sissy are socked into one another now, and they arch and push and corkscrew and jackknife softly but with pronounced cadence. everything becomes scrambled. they rock each other in cradles of sweat and saliva, until we can see nothing. noisy breaths buck out of sissy: "jelly, jelly" but she can't hear sissy because she is screaming. hysterical from the scalding hot softness of girl love.}

<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{fear in wild animals is completely different from paranoia in people. in the wilderness ecosystem, fear is natural and necessary. it's merely a mechanism for maintaining life. if the cranes hadn't had a capacity for fear, they would have disappeared long ago and you'd be having to get loaded with common old everyday meadowlarks and mallards.}

<D>__{this here discussion is destined to become academic. because we've got less than half a bag of peyote buttons left and delores's run ended up in the mottburg jail. so any day now we'll get a chance to see how the whoopers behave when they come down, to see if the peyote experience really changed them or not. but in the meantime, i want to say this about fear.....}

<D>__{but it is going to change. it's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. the clock people see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. but there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. it isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. so the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. little pockets of humanity. like the clock people. like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on siwash cave. there's almost no worldwide calamity famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield that you couldn't survive in that cave.}
<A>__{he begins to caress sissy's belly. his eyes are smiling. sissy is surprised.}

<D>__{suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. all in siwash cave. in a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. a tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. a tribe of big thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. it could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. it would have to rely on its wits and its senses. it would have to live with animals and plants! as virtual equals. it's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{how am i going to be the progenitor of a tribe when i'm living on an isolated ridgetop with delores?}
<C>__{chink}
<D>__{that's your problem.}
<A>__{the chink coughs.}
<C>__{chink}
<D>__{listen to the way i'm babbling. that bullet must have loosened one of my transistors. don't pay any attention to me. you've got to work it out for yourself. the westbound choo choo leaves mottburg at one forty. i want to be on it. will you drive me to the station?}
<L>__{interior truck day}
<A>__{sissy and delores are driving the chink out the front gate of the rubber rose.}
<C>__{chink}
<D>__{schedules! ironic how i have to follow timetables in order to get back to the clockworks.}
<A>__{he yells out the window of the moving vehicle.}
<C>__{chink}
<D>__{don't ever bet against paradox, ladies...}
<L>__{exterior the rubber rose gates}
<A>__{we hear the chink yelling, and the rubber rose sign is being changed to one that reads el rancho jellybean.}
<C>__{chink}
<D>__{....if complexity doesn't beat you, then paradox will. ha ha ho ho and hee hee.....}
<A>__{and the truck disappears into the prairie land. a long dark pause, until finally we are inside the cave where the chink's clockworks are at work..... poing! it is revealed that sissy is with delores snug in the old hermit's living quarters. she listens to the clinking of the chink's clockworks. and feels her belly. the swell of her belly has forced her to sleep on her back. close view of sissy's belly, and a little foot kicks from inside. or is it a foot? view inside the belly of sissy's unborn baby. it is half japanese, one thirty second siwash and all thumbs. the moving thumbs are hitchhiking you.....}
