<A>__{in contrast to those about him, there is tension in godse's face, an air of danger in his movements. he glances at two policemen who are talking casually, absorbed in their own gossip then he looks back at another tonga that pulls up just behind his. two young men (apte and karkare) meet godse's gaze, and again we get the sense of imminent danger. they descend and pay their driver absently, their eyes watching the crowd. sitting along in the shadows of a stationary tonga a little distance down the street an elderly man (prakash) with a short, close cropped beard and the taut, sunken flesh of a cadaver is watching... apte and karkare look back at him. there is just the slightest acknowledgment and then prakash lifts his eyes to the gate, as though to tell them to be about their business. the gate at birla house exterior day godse hesitates before approaching the two gardeners who nonchalantly flank the entrance. he stiffens himself, cautiously touches something under his khaki jacket, then glances back at the stoic face of prakash. prakash's gaze is as firm and unrelenting as a death's head. godse turns back, wetting his lips nervously, then moves into the middle of a group going through the gate. garden birla house exterior twilight a fairly numerous crowd is gathering here, informally filling the area on one side of a walk that leads to a little pavilion some devout, some curious, some just eager to be near the great man. godse moves forward through them toward the front just as hushed voices begin to remark "i see him." "here he comes!" "which one is manu?"... apte and karkare move to different sides of godse, staying a little behind, their movements sly and wary, aware of people watching. featuring gandhi. we see him distantly through the crowd. the brown, wiry figure cloaked only in loincloth and shawl, still weak from his last fast and moving without his customary spring and energy as he is supported by his two grand nieces, his "walking sticks," manu and abha. we do not see him clearly until the very last moment only glimpses of him as he smiles, and exchanges little jokes with some of the crowd and the two young women who support him, occasionally joining his hands together in greeting to someone in particular, then once more proceeding with a hand on the shoulder of each of the girls. the camera keeps moving closer, and the point of view is always godse's, but gandhi is always in profile or half obscured by the heads and shoulders of those in front. we hear the occasional click of a camera, and we intercut with shots of godse moving tensely up through the crowd, of apte and karkare on the periphery of the crowd, watching with sudden fear and apprehension, like men paralysed by the presence of danger. featuring godse. he slides through to the very front rank. his breathing is short and there is perspiration around the sides of his temples. and now, for an instant we see gandhi close from his point of view. he is only a few steps away, but turned to speak to someone on the other side, and manu half obscures him. godse swallows dryly, tension lining his face then he moves boldly out into gandhi's path, bumping manu, knocking a vessel for incense from her hands.}

<D>__{murrow's voice over ... but perhaps to this man of peace, to this fighter who fought without malice or falsehood or hate, the tribute he would value most has come from general douglas mcarthur: "if civilization is to survive," the general said this morning, "all men cannot fail to adopt gandhi's belief that the use of force to resolve conflict is not only wrong but contains within itself the germ of our own self destruction."...}
<A>__{a news truck is parked in the mass of the crowd. as the cortege nears, the photographers on it stand to snap their pictures. there is a newsreel crew center. the camera features a woman photographer (margaret bourke white) who sits with her legs dangling over the side of the truck, her famous camera held loosely in her hand, un regarded, as she watches the body of gandhi approach. the intelligent features are betrayed by the emotion in her eyes. for an instant we see gandhi from her point of view, and read the personal impact it has on her.}

<A>__{a small, round ayah (an indian nursemaid) pushes open the door and proudly admits her charges, gandhi's sons: harilal (ten), manilal (six) and ramdas (two). they are all dressed in european suits, ties and stiff collars. they step forward, one by one, making the pranam (the hindu gesture of greeting), then bending and touching the hands and lips to gandhi's feet in the traditional obeisance of child to father.}
<C>__{harilal}
<D>__{we are glad to have you back, bapu.}
<A>__{gandhi smiles.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{and i am glad to be back.}
<P>__{(he holds his hands out to ramdas.)}
<D>__{come...}
<A>__{and ramdas runs to him and gandhi bends to kiss him as ramdas put his arms around his neck.}
<C>__{ba}
<D>__{be careful!}
<A>__{gandhi pats him indulgently, then carefully stands erect, looking at them all with satisfaction.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{tomorrow i will tell you what it feels like to be a jailbird.}
<A>__{the two older boys show the expected apprehension and interest. gandhi nods to the ayah. she claps her hands smartly.}
<C>__{ayah}
<D>__{come. come.}
<A>__{the boys bow and leave like boys used to household discipline. the ayah closes the door and we hear their chatter at they go down the hall.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{just like proper english gentlemen. i'm proud of them.}
<C>__{ba}
<D>__{they are boys. and they're indian.}
<A>__{gandhi is stretching out on the bed, taking up another paper.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{hm. will you take this off?}
<P>__{(he touches the bandage on his cheek)}
<D>__{it pinches every time i speak.}
<A>__{ba comes and sits down on the bed beside him, maneuvering so that she can get at the bandage.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{here, you see? even the south african papers apologize "a monstrous attack."}
<C>__{ba}
<P>__{(of the tape, as she is about to pull it)}
<D>__{are you sure?}
<C>__{gandhi}
<P>__{(impatiently)}
<D>__{yes i can't talk like this.}
<A>__{ba pauses and looks at him mischievously, as though that's not a bad idea. he scowls at her, then recognizes her "joke" and grins.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{pull!}
<A>__{ba pulls one of the strands of tape and gandhi flinches.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{oww!}
<C>__{ba}
<P>__{(mockingly)}
<D>__{mr. khan said they called you brave.}
<A>__{gandhi is nursing the moustache; he looks at her wryly.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{if you would let me teach you to read, you could see for yourself.}
<A>__{she leans forward to pull at the remaining piece.}
<C>__{ba}
<D>__{i could have told them you were merely foolish.}
<A>__{gandhi is watching her as she leans across him, her beauty and proximity obviously stirring him.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{it proves what i told you. if i had prosecuted him as everyone advised even you they would have hated me by showing forgiveness i ouch!}
<A>__{she has pulled the other piece.}
<C>__{ba}
<D>__{there...}
<A>__{and she slowly pries the gauze free from the strands of hair above his lip. as she does gandhi watches her more and more intently, and slips his arms around her back.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<P>__{(as though continuing the argument)}
<D>__{you see there is such a thing as moral force and it can be harnessed.}
<A>__{ba examines the bandage and gently touches the wound, but she is aware of his burning eyes and arms around her back.}
<C>__{ba}
<D>__{not always. you have told me twice now that you were giving up the pleasures of the flesh.}
<A>__{it slows gandhi uneasily for a moment and ba must grin at his discomfiture. he leans back still holding her, but looking at the ceiling.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{i am. i am convinced the holy men are right. when you give up, you gain. the simpler your life the better.}
<A>__{ba makes a moue of acceptance and starts to pull free of him but his arms still hold her. she smothers a smile and lies down, her face next to his, but neither of them looking at each other. a long beat... and then gandhi turns his head. she is aware of his eyes on her, but she doesn't move. gandhi leans forward and touches his lips to her neck.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{i will fast tomorrow as a penance.}
<A>__{ba smiles. still not looking at him, she places her hand behind his head, gently.}
<C>__{ba}
<D>__{if you enjoy it a great deal you must fast for two days.}
<A>__{gandhi laughs... and buries her in love. street and courtyard of government building johannesburg }
