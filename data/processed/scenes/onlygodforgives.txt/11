<A>__{we track with billy as he makes his way through the small subterranean nightclub. a thai man known as the lizard sits by a table with a few locals gambling... he spots billy and follows him with his eyes as he continues to gamble. billy moves across to a small private corner... ... where he meets various men and women, all smoking methamphetamine. billy joins in but an argument quickly starts up between him and another thai man. the music's too loud to hear what they're arguing about but it suddenly gets out of control... billy starts viciously hitting the thai man and quickly the room explodes in a frenzy of violence.}
