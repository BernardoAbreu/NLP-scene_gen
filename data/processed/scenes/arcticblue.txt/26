<L>__{exterior sportsmen's camp}
<A>__{corbett gets out of the jeep. he regards the sportsmen, their shotguns and their mess with ill concealed contempt. the sportsmen clutch their weapons and watch corbett. he walks around the camp, spotting a rubber lined rucksack stuffed with dead ermine. after a long, tense moment, corbett smiles.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{looks like you've had some luck. where's your guide? sportsman #1 we're on our own, if it's any of your damn business.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(re ermine)}
<D>__{you did real good.}
<A>__{he crouches next to the dead animals and strokes the fur.}
<C>__{lemalle}
<P>__{(to corbett)}
<D>__{no swinging shit. they're over their goddamned limit.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(to sportsmen)}
<D>__{my friend is right. supposed to have a licensed guide when you're on this land, too. sportsman #1 hey, we paid our fuckin' permit fees.}
<A>__{lemalle amuses himself by pissing in their campfire. no one notices that in the b.g., quiet sportsman #3 unzips his parka, exposing a .45 peacemaker in a belt holster.}
<D>__{sportsman #2 i were you, i'd drive right on outta here again. now.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{this was my roaming land, 'til the government took it over. only innuit can hunt here now, and tourists, like you.}
<A>__{corbett swings the rucksack of carcasses onto the hood of the land rover. pissed, sportsmen #1 and #2 step closer to him.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{according to tribal law, hunters passing through the land of another tribe can only take game to survive. they can eat the meat, but have to surrender the hides.}
<A>__{lemalle pulls a hunting knife and holds up one of the ermine.}
<C>__{lemalle}
<D>__{want the meat? sportsman #1 fuck you, dirtball.}
<A>__{corbett chuckles and mitchell spits.}
<B>__{wider}
<A>__{lemalle digs through the camping goodies in the back of the land rover, many still in their packages. he helps himself to some sandwiches and a 12 pack of beer.}
<C>__{lemalle}
<D>__{i say shoot 'em, bury 'em with their shiny new car.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<P>__{(to lemalle)}
<D>__{if you're gonna take something, take it and let's go.}
<A>__{corbett looks down to fasten the top of the rucksack.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{suddenly, sportsman #3 reaches inside his parka and pulls the pistol. he swings it toward lemalle. lemalle looks up when he hears the hammer cock. there is a deafeningly loud shot. sportsman #3 falls down dead at lemalle's feet. off to one side, corbett holds a huge, smoking .44 magnum six shooter in his hand. shotgun in hand, sportsman #1 gauges his chances of blasting corbett. nil. when corbett turns to him, he lies the weapon down. sportsman #2 rushes to his friend. looking bleak, mitchell spits again. corbett crosses to lemalle and knocks from his hands the things he wanted to steal. chastised, lemalle smolders. after a moment:}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(to sportsmen)}
<D>__{put him in your truck. smell of blood will attract the bears.}
<P>__{(to trappers)}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{as corbett walks to the jeep, he's too angry to notice that he's stepped in a patch of mud under the land rover. near the jeep, lemalle stops and pulls them into a huddle.}
<C>__{lemalle}
<D>__{i don't believe in leavin' witnesses behind, ben.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{it was self defense. leave it at that.}
<C>__{lemalle}
<D>__{you think those fucks will tell it that way?}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(ending the argument)}
<D>__{we'll get a head start before they go crying to the law.}
<A>__{corbett turns and fires two rounds from his .44 into the engine of the land rover. the sportsmen stare and sputter.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(continuing; to sportsmen)}
<D>__{you can pack out of here two, three days' hike along this river at most. weather should hold this early in the season.}
<A>__{corbett and mitchell get in their jeep.}
<B>__{lemalle}
<A>__{isn't yet satisfied. he walks back over to the sportsmen, kneeling beside their fallen friend, and crouches right beside them. intimidated, sportsman #2 looks away, but lemalle grabs his chin and turns his face back toward him.}
<C>__{lemalle}
<D>__{think i'm pretty? you better forget how we look, 'cause next time they won't keep me from killing you. this land ain't quite civilized, you know...}
<A>__{he unsheathes his buck knife. below frame, he slices across the forehead of the dead sportsman, peels back his scalp and cuts it loose, indian style. the sportsmen are stunned and sickened. angle on trappers' jeep corbett looks at mitchell and wearily shakes his head.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{at least he scalped the dead one.}
