<L>__{interior memory studio day}
<A>__{mcclane come quickly in, brushing the swinging door open. lull and ernie look up as he enters. quail lies on the couch, breathing slowly and regularly, his eyes closed. mcclane looks queryingly at lull, who motions him to silence.}
<C>__{lull}
<P>__{(bends over quail)}
<D>__{quail? dougie, can you hear me?}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{lull}
<D>__{tell mcclane what you told us.}
<A>__{mcclane glances sharply at lull, then turns to quail. quail's eyes open and scan the room. they settle on mcclane. these eyes have changed: they have become cold and steely. in fact, quail's entire personality seems to have changed his face has acquired a flint edged hardness. he is chillingly menacing.}
<C>__{quail}
<P>__{(a deadly voice)}
<D>__{all of you in this room are dead. mcclane}
<P>__{(not quite}
<D>__{taking it}
<P>__{seriously)}
<D>__{what's he talking about?}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{you've broken my cover. mcclane what is this?...}
<A>__{mcclane's eyes flash angrily at lull.}
<C>__{lull}
<D>__{the narkadine cracked a memory cap. mars }
<P>__{(she's scared)}
<D>__{he's really been there.}
<A>__{there is a chilly silence in the room as mcclane digests this.}
<D>__{mcclane forced suppression?}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{with spontaneous breakthrough. mcclane holy shit.}
<A>__{they stare at quail as if he's a ticking bomb.}
<C>__{quail}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{you've compromised the sphinx project. you'll have to be silenced.}
<A>__{now they're all panicked.}
<D>__{mcclane wait a minute. quail }
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{my name isn't quail. mcclane listen... whoever you are... sir....}
<P>__{(almost pleading)}
<D>__{...this is all an accident. we'll destroy all the records. no one will know. i swear it. believe me.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{i believe you, but that won't stop e.t.o. from killing you.}
<A>__{the rekall people stare at each other in quiet horror.}
<C>__{quail}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{killing you... killing you... killing you....}
<A>__{his voice trails off, his eyes close.}
<C>__{lull}
<P>__{(intensely)}
<D>__{he wants a false memory implanted of a trip he really took.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{someone at earth intelligence operations erased his memory. all he know was going to mars meant something special to him.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{what do we do? graft a false memory pattern over the real memory of the same thing?}
<C>__{lull}
<P>__{(shaking her head)}
<D>__{uh uh... that could promote a partial breakthrough of the real trip. mcclane}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{revive him without any false memory implantation and get him out of here.}
<C>__{lull}
<D>__{why don't we just wipe out the memory of his visit here? mcclane}
<P>__{(nodding; relieved)}
<D>__{yes. good. i will destroy his file and cancel his fee. i have a feeling that the longer he doesn't know who he is, where he's been, where he's going and who we are, the better off we'll all be. i'm taking a holiday. a real one.}
<A>__{he leaves. the others stare after him, looking very grim.}
