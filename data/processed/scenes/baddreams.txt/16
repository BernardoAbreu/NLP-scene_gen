<A>__{berrisford parks her and site down across from her.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{what... what kind of doctor did you say you were?}
<A>__{berrisford notices one of the tissues on his neck. scowls, flicks it away.}
<C>__{berrisford}
<D>__{obviously, i'm not a surgeon.}
<P>__{(as she laughs)}
<D>__{i'm a psychiatrist.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<P>__{(puzzled)}
<D>__{why do i need a psychiatrist?}
<C>__{berrisford}
<D>__{cynthia, you've been out of touch with reality for over ten years. your recovery goes beyond your muscle tone... you have to ease into life... into interacting with other people again. into a world that's changed so much that sometimes i get confused by it.}
<P>__{(taking out an appointment book)}
<D>__{now, my assistant dr. goldman has a group therapy session every day... i'm putting you down for it, starting tomorrow...}
<C>__{cynthia}
<P>__{(unsure)}
<D>__{group therapy? but }
<C>__{wasserman's voice}
<D>__{dr. berrisford?}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{revealing wasserman. he shows his badge to the doctor.}
<C>__{wasserman}
<D>__{i'm lieutenant wasserman. i left a message with your secretary...?}
<C>__{berrisford}
<P>__{(rising, meeting him halfway)}
<D>__{and i left one with your desk sergeant.}
<P>__{(a hard whisper)}
<D>__{i told you this would have to wait. you shouldn't even be here }
<B>__{favoring cynthia}
<A>__{she can't help but listen as they continue in lowered tones.}
<C>__{wasserman}
<D>__{i've waited fifteen years. that's long enough. now i want to speak with miss weston.}
<C>__{berrisford}
<D>__{miss weston is still recovering and is in no condition for a prolonged interrogation.}
<C>__{wasserman}
<P>__{(tight smile)}
<D>__{then don't prolong it. i will be brief with her, i will be gentle with her }
<C>__{berrisford}
<D>__{i will let you know when she's ready }
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{e excuse me...}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{they turn and look at her.}
<C>__{cynthia }
<D>__{doctor berrisford, what's this all about...? this man wants to talk to me...?}
<A>__{berrisford starts to answer, but wasserman rushes in.}
<C>__{wasserman}
<P>__{(quietly, slowly, as if to a child)}
<D>__{that's right, miss weston. i just have a few easy, simple questions.}
<P>__{(patient, phony smile)}
<D>__{about you... and about unity house.}
<A>__{cynthia looks at him strangely, turns to berrisford.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{why is he talking like that? is he one of your patients?}
<A>__{wasserman burns. berrisford laughs.}
<C>__{berrisford}
<D>__{lieutenant wasserman is a police officer. and the word "patience" isn't part of his vocabulary.}
<A>__{wasserman scowls, not enjoying being the butt of a joke. he resumes his normal tons, which is far from diplomatic.}
<C>__{wasserman}
<D>__{miss weston. what's the last thing you remember before...}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{ before the accident? nothing.}
<C>__{wasserman}
<D>__{then how do you know it was an accident?}
<C>__{berrisford}
<D>__{lieutenant!}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i remember... a beautiful sunset. harris, smiling at me...}
<C>__{wasserman}
<P>__{(writing)}
<D>__{harris, he was the leader?}
<A>__{cynthia's eyes are far away. the memories come back... the words are slow, but vivid.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{leader, founder... chief cook and bottlewasher...}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{executive in charge of dreaming. we were all together... all working to make a now world... that last night, there was a...}
<P>__{(brow furrowing)}
<D>__{gathering... a... a sort of... baptism... and then...}
<A>__{she winces, rubs her eyes.}
<C>__{cynthia }
<D>__{i'm sorry, that's all i can see.}
<C>__{wasserman}
<D>__{miss weston. this "unity house"... was it a cult?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i don't understand the question.}
<C>__{berrisford}
<D>__{a "cult," cynthia. a syndrome of society you have been fortunate enough to miss. they're popular with impressionable people, the penny press...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{...and lazy policemen who like to blame them for crimes they can't solve.}
<A>__{wasserman closes his notebook, gives berrisford a cold stare.}
<C>__{wasserman}
<D>__{i was there that night, doctor. i watched them stack those bodies...}
<C>__{wasserman}
<D>__{men, women, children. they looked like 2,000 year old mummies. they broke apart like 2,000 year old mummies.}
<A>__{cynthia gasps.}
<C>__{wasserman }
<D>__{if it was an accident... fine. if it wasn't... the person responsible could still be out there.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{and he's probably as interested in miss weston's memory as i am.}
<A>__{he turns, nods to cynthia.}
<C>__{wasserman }
<D>__{feel better.}
<A>__{he goes out. cynthia's breath comes in short gasps. finally she calms.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i don't like that man.}
<C>__{berrisford}
<D>__{that makes two of us.}
<A>__{he sits beside her again.}
<C>__{berrisford }
<D>__{but as long as you're here...}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i can keep him away.}
<A>__{camera tightens on cynthia as she considers this...}
