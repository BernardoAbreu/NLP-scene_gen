<A>__{the remains of a rack of lamb, its gravy now congealed, scraps of meat adhering to the bone here and there. this is the centre piece of a table reduced to a battlefield by the guests who are laughing off screen. we pass along the table, taking in dirty plates and cutlery, napkins, glasses and emptied wine bottles. finally, we reach julia, who is still sitting at the table, while the others have retired to more comfortable seats. she looks utterly miserable, and a little drunk. the room has been spruced up for the party. candles are burning on tables and mantelpiece, there are pictures on the walls. but this is essentially cosmetic. the place has not been refurnished or re decorated. we move to the party guests. two, we recognize: kirsty, and larry who is presently entertaining the gathering with an account of his accident. the others are new faces. an american couple: bill underwood and his wife evelyn, who are of an age with larry, and a younger, bespectacled man a work colleague of larry's steve o'donnell. all are drunk. a brandy bottle sits on the table between them, and half a dozen other liquer bottles besides. steve, it soon becomes apparent, has his eyes on kirsty. larry is half way through his hospital story, gesticulating wildly as he goes through the tale, much to the pleasure of the rest. his hand and lower arm are heavily bandaged.}
