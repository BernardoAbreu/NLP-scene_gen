<A>__{tight angle tabletop as eric's hands place ratso's boom box on the table and click on suitable weird b.g. music. angle floor level eric's boots pass frame. an open can of cat food clanks down big in f.g. as eric walks b.g. obviously wearing tin tin's trenchcoat. gabriel noses into to frame to eat from the can.}
<L>__{interior loft, bedroom night (later)}
<A>__{shelly's vanity. dusty, disused. the mirror spiderwebbed with cracks but still hanging precariously in its frame. eric is seated, his image crazily split into many. he pulls on a long sleeved, tight knit, black shirt. widen angle to reveal the loft now lit with dozens of candle stubs. placed all around. ceremonial and weird. close up eric}

<A>__{in the mirror, multi eric's. he touches the glass, tightening up as he realizes he's in for another flash: shelly, sleeping on her divan, a year ago, wakes as eric (o.s.) says "boo". she cracks an eye open.}
