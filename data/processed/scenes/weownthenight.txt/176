<A>__{then he spots an area in which the smoke flows unnaturally, against the breeze, as though it surges around something... something covered in smoke, standing... a gust of wind passes revealing a silhouetted figure, with his arm raised, pointing, right at bobby. vadim nezhinski, poised to shoot. within what seems like a split second, bobby raises his shotgun and fires it. vadim crumples to the ground. a direct hit to the chest. bobby lifts his shotgun and approaches. the weeds separate, revealing nezhinski, with a look on his face that registers a kind of shock, a shock that he's been hit. nezhinski sees bobby standing over him. with all the energy he has in the world:}
