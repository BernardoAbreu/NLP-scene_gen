<A>__{a ringing satellite phone rests on a stack of gun cases. udesky, the leader of this crew, answers it.}
<C>__{udesky}
<D>__{udesky.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{yes sir. we're good to go. i will lock it down as soon as you drop me the payment.}
<A>__{with the phone still to his ear, udesky wanders out of the craft...}
<L>__{exterior cargo plane day}
<A>__{udesky looks over at nash and cooper, another mercenary. cooper's the quiet muscle of the bunch, a weapons specialist. he finishes loading a massive gun, essentially a hand cannon. it's aimed at nash's grimacing aircraft.}
<C>__{udesky}
<D>__{that's right, two of the very best i could find. no, i haven't worked with them personally, but they come with the highest recommendations.}
<A>__{then cooper fires at the grimacing aircraft. a projectile rockets into the plane and explodes with a fireball. nash and cooper exchange a satisfied smile.}
<C>__{udesky }
<D>__{you've got nothing to worry about, sir. this is going to be a piece of cake.}
<A>__{pieces of the demolished craft come raining down.}
