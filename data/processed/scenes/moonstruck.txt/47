<L>__{interior the castorini house dining room night}
<B>__{the pleased face of cosmo through a veil of steam}
<A>__{the camera pulls back. we are in the castorini dining room. cosmo sits at the head of the table, a napkin tucked into his shirt. rose has just laid down a massive platter of steaming baked fish. already on the table is a platter of pasta, loaves of bread, a big bowl of salad, two bottles of wine, and an appetizer plate of salami and pimento. seated at the table is cosmo, the old man, and raymond and rita cappomaggi. raymond is rotund, moon faced, bald, somewhere in his fifties. he has a pencil thin mustache over his small mouth. his wife, rita, looks very like him, except she has hair on her head and none on her lip. raymond is rose's brother. there are two empty places at table, for rose and loretta.}
<C>__{cosmo}
<D>__{where's loretta? we're gonna start without her.}
<B>__{one of the entrance ways to the dining room}
<A>__{there is an accordion gate across it. behind the gate, the five dogs stare at the people having dinner.}
<C>__{rose's voice}
<D>__{she must be eating out.}
<C>__{raymond's voice}
<D>__{she don't know what she's missing.}
<C>__{rose's voice}
<D>__{it's not like her not to call.}
<C>__{rita's voice}
<D>__{well, she's got a lot on her mind.}
<A>__{the dining table rita is loading up her plate}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{i mean, can we talk about it, rose? everybody's heard. she's getting married again.}
<C>__{cosmo}

<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{johnny cammareri. i think it's great and about time. what's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married?}
<C>__{cosmo}
<D>__{i don't wanna talk about it.}
<A>__{the old man has piled his plate high with food. now he stands up, walks over to the dogs, and puts the plate down in their midst. the dogs attack the food and each other. the old man walks back to the table and sits down. he looks down at the empty place in front of him, a little sad.}
<C>__{cosmo}
<D>__{my father needs a plate.}
<A>__{rose gets another plate from a sideboard and puts it in front of the old man. he immediately, methodically begins to fill his new plate. rose goes to her place and sits down.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{cosmo. many years ago, when they told me you were marrying my sister, i was happy. when i told rose i was marrying rita, she was happy.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{marriage is happy news.}
<A>__{the old man laughs uproariously, subsides, goes back to filling his plate.}
<C>__{cosmo}
<D>__{rose, pass the wine.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{i never seen anybody so in love like cosmo back then! he'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. i never told you this cause it's not really a story. but one time i woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. like a flashlight. i couldn't think a what it was. i looked out the window, and it was the moon! big as a house! i never seen the moon so big before or since. i was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. and i looked down, and standing there in the street was cosmo, looking up at the windows. this is the funny part. i got mad at you, cosmo! i thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. i was half asleep i guess and didn't know no better.}
<C>__{cosmo}
<D>__{you were altogether asleep. you were dreaming.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{no. you were there.}
<A>__{raymond stares at cosmo, nodding, remembering. there's a lull at the table, the sound of silverware.}
<C>__{cosmo}
<D>__{i don't wanna talk about it.}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(suddenly angry)}
<D>__{well, what do you wanna talk about!}
<C>__{cosmo}
<D>__{rita. pass the wine.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{why you drinking so much?}
<A>__{the old man gets up with his newly filled plate and heads for the dogs.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{old man, if you give another piece of my food to those dogs, i'm gonna kick you till you're dead!}
<A>__{the old man reverses direction and heads back to his chair. he sits down and starts to eat.}
