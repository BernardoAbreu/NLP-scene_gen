<L>__{interior rib house that night}
<A>__{it's a noisy restaurant with a large bar area. we pan to a booth of off duty cops, out of uniform now, including ray, sanchez, sharon and a few more male officers. they're all a bit high. sharon shows the signs, too. they are passing around a photo now as one cop looks at it and says...}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{beautiful.}
<A>__{... and sanchez says proudly.}
<C>__{sanchez}
<D>__{yeah. my wife's got him in agility class.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{no shit.}
<A>__{ray is handed the photo, and we see that they're talking about sanchez's dog, the name "rex" printed on the photo.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{'rex.' rex is good. i wonder who the first person was to name a dog 'fido,' and what the hell does it mean?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i like how you're always asking the big questions, ray.}
<A>__{there is some laughter. ray is a smart ass and a flirt.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i got a big question for you, pogo but i can only ask it when we're alone.}
<A>__{she moves some of the change on the table, sliding it toward ray.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{here use this call your wife and ask her instead.}
<C>__{sanchez}
<D>__{i happen to know ray's wife is busy tonight.}
<A>__{they laugh and drink and ray asks her...}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{why doesn't your partner ever come out with us?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{robby's a family man.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i'm a family man.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{yeah, but his family actually likes him.}
<A>__{more laughter. sharon's eyes do a quick roam of the bar. ray catches this.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{that lambert i guess he's not showing either.}
<A>__{she shrugs this off like it's not important and starts to slide out of the booth.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{the head. do you mind?}
<C>__{sanchez}
<D>__{she's just gonna freshen up her makeup.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you're wearing makeup?}
<A>__{she leaves the booth with a wry frown.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{that reminds me, ray. you still have that eye liner you borrowed from me?}
<A>__{she grins, leaving the laughter behind her. angle door catch has entered the bar. he is watching sharon leave the booth and walk to the rest rooms. he looks back at the raucous booth and hesitates. he sits at a small table near the door.}
