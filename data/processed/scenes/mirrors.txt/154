<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior day time square}
<A>__{ben walks up west 38th street to broadway and stops at the intersection of the streets, paralyzed with fear the activity of time square seems normal for an early morning, cars driving by and the eternal hustle and bustle of the pedestrians, but all the signs, all the billboards are reversed.}
<B>__{and so is the direction of the traffic flow...}
<A>__{ben turns around towards a glass building where a homeless person is sleeping his eyes fill with horror }
<B>__{he can see the reflection of the homeless man but not his own..}
<A>__{ben presses his hand against the glass. the reflection of the world surrounding him is the right way around in the mirror but he remains invisible. he removes his hand from the mirror, leaving a clear and well defined handprint on the reflective surface. ben slowly comes to realize what is happening to him if his reflection is not there, it means that he no longer belongs to the world of the living. ben did not survive }
<B>__{his soul is now a captive on the other side of the mirror...}
