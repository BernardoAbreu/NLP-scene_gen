<L>__{interior black pearl captain's cabin night}
<A>__{barbossa enters, followed by pirates carrying trays of food, wine, table setting, etc. elizabeth stands at the small table in the dress lovely.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{maid or not, it fits you.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{dare i ask the fate of its previous owner?}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{now, none of that. please dig in.}
<A>__{the table is set. elizabeth sits, cuts a tiny piece of meat, eats it daintily.}
<C>__{barbossa }
<D>__{no need to stand on ceremony, and no call to impress anyone. you must be hungry.}
<A>__{elizabeth drops the pretense: she's starving, and begins to eat like it. barbossa watches her intently.}
<C>__{barbossa }
<D>__{try the wine.}
<A>__{elizabeth does, a huge swig; she tears off a hunk of bread, devours it.}
<C>__{barbossa }
<D>__{and the apples one of those nexterior}
<A>__{she starts to bite into the apple stops. she is suddenly aware of barbossa's gaze and that he is not eating.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{it's poisoned!}
<A>__{she shoves her plate away and takes the opportunity to palm her knife. barbossa laughs.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{oh, there would be no sense in killing you, miss turner.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{then why aren't you eating?}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{would that i could.}
<A>__{he produces the medallion, lets it dangle from his fingers.}
<C>__{barbossa }
<D>__{do you not know what this is, then?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{it's a pirate medallion.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{it's a piece of the treasure of isla de muerta .}
<A>__{elizabeth gives an infinitesimal shrug, intrigued despite herself.}
<C>__{barbossa }
<D>__{ah, so you don't know as much as you pretend. back when cortes was cutting a great bloody swath through the new world, a high priest gave. him all the gold they had, with one condition: that he spare the people's lives. of course, cortes being cortes, he didn't.}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{he'd've made a great pirate, that one.}
<A>__{barbossa stands, moves to a shelf. puts a key to a medium sized polished wooden box the captain's chest. opens it.}
<C>__{barbossa }
<D>__{so the priest, with his dying breath, called on the power of the blood of his people, and put on the gold a curse. if anyone took so much as a single piece, as he was compelled by greed, by greed he would be consumed.}
<A>__{inside the chest are charts, some gold, a sextant and a few pages of a mayan codex, pieces of tree bark inscribed with mayan glyphs. barbossa removes them carefully, sets them on the table. pours over them.}
<C>__{barbossa }
<D>__{within a day of leaving port for spain, the treasure ship carrying the gold ... something went wrong. the ship run aground, every man aboard dead, save one. he survived long enough to hide the gold ashore.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{over time, the dark magic of the curse seeped into the place, making it a cursed island. an island of death. isla de muerta.}
<A>__{he looks up. elizabeth has been rapt, involved in the story but feigns a dismissive attitude.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{that's all very interesting, but i hardly believe in ghost stories any more.}
<A>__{barbossa is angry. he stands, sweeps the food off the table.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{you idiot girl! it's no make believe! my crew and i, we found the gold, and we did more than take one piece, we took it all. rich men we were and we spent it and traded it and gave it away in exchange}
<A>__{for drink and food and pleasant company. but we found out: the drink could not sate us, and the food turned to ashes in our mouths, and no amount of pleasant company could ease our torment. (regains his composure) we are cursed men, miss turner, condemned, to be forever consumed by our own greed. gold calls to ub, always, and we are driven, always, to find more, and add it to the treasure. barbossa picks up the priceless codex. crushes them in his fist.}
<C>__{barbossa }
<D>__{there is but one way to remove the curse. all of the scattered pieces of the treasure must be restored in full, and the blood repaid.}
<P>__{(he throws the pages aside)}
<D>__{we've recovered every piece save for this.}
<P>__{(holds up the medallion)}
<D>__{and as for the blood ... that's what we have you for.}
<P>__{(pleasant, finally getting to his point)}
<D>__{and that's why there's no sense in killing you. yet.}
<A>__{elizabeth stares at him, horrified. using the toe of his boot, barbossa flips an apple up off the floor, catches it, extends it to elizabeth.}
<C>__{barbossa }
<D>__{apple?}
<A>__{elizabeth slowly reaches for the apple and then comes up out of her chair, trying to run around barbossa_ they struggle briefly, and then suddenly he shoves her away elizabeth's stolen knife is buried in barbossa's chest, to the hilt barbossa is completely unaffected. he opens his shirt to get a better look at the knife, pulls it out with little effort. there is blood on the blade, but none anywhere else.}
<C>__{barbossa }
<D>__{i'm curious after killing me, what is it you were planning to do next?}
<A>__{elizabeth backs away, whirls and barrels out the door }
