<L>__{interior icu morning}
<A>__{julie, in her white lab coat, wanders through intensive care and finds a woman hunched over stu's bed, bawling her eyes out.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{kimmy...?}
<A>__{kimmy looks up. she's crying so much she can barely recognize julie.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{oh, julie...my poor stu...my poor baby brother...}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{when'd you get in?}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{an hour ago.}
<P>__{(gathering herself)}
<D>__{i tried to prepare myself, but i didn't know he would be like, like this. i can't even bear to look at him... how about you? you're okay?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i'm fine, kimmy. fine.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{i had so much i always wanted to say to him. at least he had a chance to give you the ring.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{the ring...}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{grandmama's ring. the engagement ring. he asked me to send it to him }
<A>__{julie turns to look at stu in the bed. the certain knowledge that he was about to propose is like a knife in her heart. kimmy feels bad as well, having let the cat out of the bag, but before they can hash it out }
<C>__{voice from behind}
<D>__{mrs. brewster? julie? i'm dr. edelstein.}
<A>__{cheery dr. edelstein enters. he shakes hands with the women, then checks stu's readouts, making notations on his clipboard.}
<C>__{dr. edelstein}
<D>__{vital signs have stabilized. that's good.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?}
<C>__{dr. edelstein}
<D>__{he's held on this far. we can't do much but wait and see.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{but these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?}
<A>__{this remark sends a shiver down julie's spine, but she keeps silent.}
<C>__{dr. edelstein}
<D>__{at the moment, yes.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?}
<C>__{dr. edelstein}
<D>__{comas are unpredictable. he could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{honey, i have to clarify this. the thing is, dr. edelstein, my brother has an absolute horror of doctors hospitals needles all of it }
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. he doesn't even know he's in a }
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{please, julie. this is not easy for me. our father took a long time to die. a long time. it just about killed us all. and stu and i made a pact that when our time came we wouldn't let it drag out.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{it's too soon even to talk about that!}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{give me a date, doctor.}
<C>__{dr. edelstein}
<D>__{three months.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{there's always some brain damage. but at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{i want him to have every chance, doctor. we can certainly give it...three months.}
<A>__{no one says anything. but both women look at stu, and then at each other, and everyone knows exactly where everyone else stands. julie has a sinking feeling that stu is working on a 3 month deadline.}
