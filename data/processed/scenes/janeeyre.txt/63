<L>__{exterior day. a frozen meadow.}
<A>__{jane is walking with purpose, carrying a bundle of letters. the exercise is lifting her spirits. the sun is sinking, turning the frost gold.}
<L>__{exterior day. a frozen wood.}
<A>__{a brook runs close to the path; half frozen. its slow trickle is the only sound to be heard. jane moves slowly, acutely aware of everything around her. further into the wood, the brook has frozen right across the path. jane slips on it as she passes. the noise of her feet echoes. she steadies herself. she gazes at a huddle of snowdrops, their heads bowed. a crystal drop of water runs to the end of a snowdrop and begins to freeze as she watches. it is held suspended as if the whole winter is contained in it. the moon is mounting the sky. jane hears a sound like the beating of wings. the blood is rushing through her ears. her trance is broken by the figure of a great dog which glides past her so close it almost knocks her off her feet. the beating is loud; not wings she realises, but the rush of an approaching horse. it is almost on top of her before she can move. her shocked, pale face, her black garments startle both horse and rider.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{what the deuce }
<A>__{the rider gets the horse under control and continues, only to have his horse slip on the ice. both man and horse fall with a crash. the dog begins to bark, until the hills echo with the sound. the horse is on one side; the man is lying, trapped beneath it on the ice; edward fairfax rochester.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{hellfire.}
<A>__{jane is confounded.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{pilot, get down! get down i say!}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{can i do anything, sir?}
<A>__{rochester stares at her; a tiny black figure, surrounded by darkening frost, the low moon behind her.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{get back.}
<A>__{jane doesn't move. rochester turns to his horse.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{mesrour. mesrour.}
<A>__{with much stamping and clattering, the horse clambers to its feet. rochester seems relieved. he tries to stand himself. his ankle will bear no weight. he lets out an involuntary cry. it echoes:}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{damnation.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{are you injured, sir?}
<A>__{rochester looks at her once more. he manages to get himself off the ice. he sits on a nearby stile. jane approaches him. she now has the moon on her face. she begins to look less like a phantom and more like a girl.}
<C>__{jane }
<D>__{if you are hurt and want help i can fetch someone from the village. i'm on my way there to post a letter.}
<A>__{rochester looks as if he doesn't believe her.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{where do you come from?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{thornfield hall.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{whose house is that?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{mr rochester's.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{do you know mr rochester?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{no, i've never seen him.}
<A>__{rochester is trying to place her. she is a puzzle to him.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{you're not a servant there...}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i am the governess, sir.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{the governess.}
<P>__{(a slow smile)}
<D>__{deuce take me, i had forgotten.}
<A>__{examining jane once more, he laughs a low laugh.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{the governess.}
<A>__{jane does not like to be laughed at.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{have you got an umbrella i can use as a stick?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{then try to get hold of his bridle and lead him to me.}
<A>__{jane doesn't like his imperious tone. she looks at the horse; huge, trampling, nervous. rochester is amused.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{if you would be so kind...}
<A>__{jane obeys. she endeavours to catch the bridle but the horse rears away. jane falls on the ice. rochester bursts out laughing. jane picks herself up.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{perhaps it would be easier to bring me to the horse. come here.}
<A>__{jane resists.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{forgive me. i must beg of you to come here.}
<A>__{jane approaches. rochester instantly leans all his weight on her. she almost crumples under it; the first time she has ever touched and been touched by a man. she holds him up. and walks him closer to his horse.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{mesrour.}
<A>__{the horse approaches him. rochester calms it. he springs into the saddle, grimacing as he wrenches his sprain.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{thank you.}
<P>__{(he bows.)}
<D>__{now, make haste with your letter.}
<A>__{rochester's spurred heel makes the horse start and rear. jane steps back. the horse bounds away, the dog rushing in its traces. all three disappear. jane doesn't move until the sound of hooves has faded away. her face is flushed, her eyes glitter in the dark. i e. night. thornfield the front entrance hall. jane runs up to the front door. she pushes it open. to her amazement, there is a fire burning in the stone fireplace. the whole hall is lit. the double doors are open into the library. mrs fairfax is hurriedly approaching.}
<C>__{mrs fairfax}
<D>__{mr rochester is here.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{oh?}
<C>__{mrs fairfax}
<D>__{go and change your frock; he wishes to meet you.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i have to change?}
<C>__{mrs fairfax}
<D>__{oh yes i always dress for the evening when mr rochester is here.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{but all my dresses are the same.}
<C>__{mrs fairfax}
<P>__{(desperately)}
<D>__{you must have one that is better? he's in a terrible humour; the doctor has been. his horse fell in hay lane and his ankle is sprained.}
<A>__{mrs fairfax anxiously hurries back into the library. a large dog wanders out. jane finds herself looking at pilot. she smiles.}
