<L>__{exterior canyon wall}
<A>__{flatbed looks like a toy, tumbling away down the wall. soon its lights vanish.}
<L>__{interior cab one}
<A>__{they're both going to have a lot of bruises... lindsey is surveying the damage. water is spraying down on them like a shower, and lights are flickering.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{you did okay, back there. i was fairly impressed.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{not good enough. we still gotta catch big geek.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{not in this thing.}
<A>__{lindsey is flipping switches. nothing works.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{you totaled it, huh?}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{yeah. so sue me.}
<A>__{bud looks down. there's already about a foot of water sloshing around the floor at their feet.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{it's flooding like a son of the bitch.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{you noticed.}
<A>__{she picks up and hand mike of the underwater telephone.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{deepcore, deepcore, this is cab one, over.}
<A>__{she waits. no response.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{try again.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{deepcore, this is cab one. we need assistance, over. deepcore, this }
<A>__{with a searing crackle or arc light, a power panel shorts out and everything goes black.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{well, that's that.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{wonderful.}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{there's some light from somewhere...}
<A>__{a faint illumination, dimmer than moonlight, washes in through the front port. lindsey scrunches up against the acrylic and scans the darkness.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{over there. it's the rig.}
<A>__{a glow, beyond a rock promontory... like the lights of a town just over the hill in the desert.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{good hundred yards, i'd say.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{they'll come out after us.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find us. we better get this flooding stopped.}
<A>__{he picks up his helmet and clicks on the light. using the thing like a bulky flashlight. the water is really pouring in, spraying them like a shower... almost two feet deep already.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{you see where it's coming in?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{somewhere behind this panel. hold this.}
<A>__{she takes the light and he tries to reach the burst weld, which is blocked by a steel switch panel and a bunch of conduit.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{can't get to it. have to pull this panel off. you go any tools?}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{i don't know, look around.}
<A>__{bud scans the cramped interior, feels around under the water. it's past his knees.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{nothing. son of a bitch. all i need's a goddamn crescent wrench.}
<A>__{he grabs the panel in both hands and starts torquing on it, trying to wrench it off the wall. heaves on it repeatedly. finally stops, panting. he's breathing hard now, and it's not just effort.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{son of a bitch!}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{calm down, bud.}
<A>__{a nervous edge in her voice now. bud's turning all around, looking around for anything, trying to think fast. water up to their waists. the sea closing in.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{okay... okay. we gotta get you out of here.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i don't know how!}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{we've only got one suit.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i know! i know! but we better come up with something.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{aaargh!! i'm freezing!}
<A>__{she climbs up on the pilots seat, scrunching right up against the ceiling, keeping as much of herself as possible out of the frigid water. she's shaking all over with the cold, and getting drenched from above by water pouring in.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back with another suit.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough time. look at this...}
<P>__{(the rate of flooding)}
<D>__{time i get back you'll be }
<A>__{that stops the conversation for a second. about two feet of airspace left. bud can't believe what this is coming down to. they both stare at each other for a long moment. he makes a decision. starts pulling off his backpack.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{alright, put this on.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{what, you growing gills all of a sudden? you got it on, keep it on.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{don't argue, goddamnit, just }
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{no way! forget it. not an option.}
<A>__{bud has his pack off uncoupling it. she keeps fighting his hands, stopping him, hooking it back up. the desperation of the situation fuel the struggle.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up }
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{no!! now be logical, bud, you're }
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{fuck logic!!}
<A>__{they're both right up against the ceiling, water up to their chests. lindsey's lips are blue and trembling from the cold.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{listen... will you listen to me for a second!? you're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me. right? so i got a plan...}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{what's the plan?}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{i drown, you tow me back to the rig }
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{what kind of plan is that!??}
<A>__{lindsey's gut scared... shaking violently, her eyes wide. but she's keeping it together. thinking it out. bud see the bottomless pit opening to take her and he can barely think.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{look, this water is only a couple degrees above freezing. i drown. i go into deep hypothermia... my blood like icewater. i can maybe be revived after ten, fifteen minutes. you got all the stuff to do it on the rig.}
<A>__{bud stops moving and looks into her face, inches from him. the water is up to their necks. he knows that, as always, infuriatingly, lindsey is right.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{it is insane.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{it's the only way, bud. now trust me.}
<A>__{she takes a deep breath. before her nerve fails she busies her hands on his suit, rehooking everything.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{jesus, i don't believe this is happening.}
<A>__{she raise his helmet. water up to their chins. they lock eyes, inches apart. he can feel her breath on his face... maybe for the last time.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{oh god, lins... i }
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{tell me later.}
<A>__{he grabs her head in both hands and pulls her mouth to his. they lock together in a fierce kiss, fueled by passion and terror... the naked realization of love hanging over the abyss of death. she breaks away at the last possible second and quickly pulls his helmet over his head. seats is down over the neck ring. lock the bail out handle, sealing it. even with her head press up into the highest point of the ceiling, lindsey's mouth is barely above water. she give a scared little laugh.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{this is maybe not such a great plan, is it?}
<A>__{she is half paralyzed with the cold, shaking pathetically. puts her face to the glass of his helmet. seconds to go.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{hold me. hold me, bud... i'm so scared...}
<A>__{he can't hear her, but he read her lips. they clutch each other desperately. the embrace last while the water rises over her mouth and nose. she starts to choke. her hands grip his shoulders like claws. she bucks and thrashes. bud holds her, and a scream tears loose from him, a pure agony of the soul.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{nooooo!!!}
<A>__{the freezing seawater races into her lungs. her finger go slack, and her hands float lifelessly. bud stares, transfixed, as the last tiny bubble trickles out of lindsey's open mouth. he kicks himself into gear, fingers frenzied as he spins the wheel of the lockout hatch.}
