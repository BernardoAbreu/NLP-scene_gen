<L>__{interior coruscant, chancellor's office}
<A>__{a hologram of obi wan flickers in front of a group, made up of jedi (yoda, mace windu, and ki adi mundi) and senators (bail organa, ask aak, luminara, and jar jar). palpatine and mas amedda are in the middle of the group, watching with growing concern.}
<D>__{obi wan ...starships from the trade federation and the commerce guilds are taking deliveries of battle droids from the foundries on geonosis.}
<C>__{bail organa}
<D>__{that's outrageous! the treaty forbids the trade federation from building up an army. what are they doing?! obi wan the droid foundry seems to be working at full capacity. i am going to go down and investigate. i will bring jango fett back home for interrogation.}
<C>__{palpatine}
<D>__{those geonosian foundries are part of the techno union. we will call in their representatives and ask them a few very pointed questions. obi wan one more thing. jango mentioned he was recruited by someone named darth tyranus. any idea who that might be?}
<C>__{yoda}
<D>__{with the forename darth, a sith he must be.}
<C>__{mace windu}
<D>__{our missing apprentice. they are playing their hand at last. obi wan do you believe he could be the mysterious sido dyas, who made the deal for the clone army?}
<C>__{yoda}
<D>__{perhaps too many pieces are missing from this puzzle, there are.}
<C>__{mace windu}
<D>__{be careful, obi wan. this investigation is becoming less than routine. do you need help? obi wan let me see if i can figure out what's going on first.}
<A>__{the hologram of obi wan fades off. palpatine stares at the spot where the hologram was in disbelief.}
<C>__{bail organa}
<D>__{the commerce guilds are preparing for war... there can be no doubt of that.}
<C>__{palpatine}
<D>__{count dooku must have made a treaty with them.}
<C>__{mace windu}
<D>__{we must stop them soon before they're fully ready.}
<C>__{senator ask aak}
<D>__{the debate is over, we need that clone army now!}
<C>__{bail organa}
<D>__{unfortunately, the debate is not over. the senate will never be able to approve the use of that army before the separatists attack.}
<A>__{mas amedda, who had been silent up until now suddenly speaks up.}
<C>__{mas amedda}
<D>__{this is a crisis! if the senate votes the chancellor emergency powers, he could approve the use of the army in a minute.}
<C>__{palpatine}
<D>__{please, please, i don't wish to have emergency powers. that's too extreme a solution. it's akin to a dictatorship. we must rely on the jedi. master yoda, how many are available to go to geonosis?}
<A>__{mace windu and yoda look at one another.}
<C>__{yoda}
<D>__{two hundred,... less or more.}
<C>__{bail organa}
<D>__{with all due respect for the jedi order, two hundred will be no match for hundreds of thousands of battle droids.}
<C>__{mace windu}
<D>__{patience. we should wait for obi wan to report back. we don't know that count dooku has made a treaty with the corporate alliance, it's speculation.}
<C>__{senator ask aak}
<D>__{but we must prepare for the worst. i'm going to propose a motion granting emergency powers to the chancellor at the next session. we must not wait!}
<C>__{palpatine}
<D>__{out of the question, senator! you and i are too closely aligned. the issue will become partisan and debates will begin. the proposal must come from a neutral source.}
<C>__{mas amedda}
<D>__{if only senator amidala were here.}
<A>__{jar jar steps forward from the back of the group.}
<C>__{jar jar}
<D>__{supreme chancellor... my august colleagues, i would be proud to propose the motion in question. this is a grave situation, and i'm sure senator amidala, and the queen of naboo would agree.}
<C>__{senator ask aak}
<D>__{thank you, representative binks.}
<A>__{silence. then palpatine sighs deeply.}
<C>__{palpatine}
<D>__{if called upon, i will serve. but it will be the saddest day of my life.}
