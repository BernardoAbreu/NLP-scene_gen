<A>__{the slums are wrapped in smoke and haze from fires that burn there; an eerie dead zone, made all the stranger by the gothic spires that climb out of the haze. then silus hears something. it is the wailing of a new born child. silus moves towards the cries, then up ahead he sees a figure, kneeling on the ground. as silus moves through the haze he sees what it is. it is a brother priest, kneeling beside someone. the brother is holding the hand of the person on the ground who is in the last throws of death. when silus is next to him the priest looks up at him. tears wet his cheeks. for a moment they just stare at each other.}

<D>__{who has done this, brother?}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{we have. to our shame.}
<A>__{the silus hears the babies cries again. closer now. the priest stares at the dying creature on the ground in front of him. drops the limp hand he was holding. then rises and turns squarely to silus.}

<D>__{i have something to show you.}
<A>__{the priest moves off towards a building and silus follows. cut to}
