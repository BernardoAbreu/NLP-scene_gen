<A>__{this is a fantastic circular room, jammed with instrumentation. there are no windows, but above head level the room is ringed by viewscreens, all blank for the moment. there are seats for four men. each chair faces a console and is surrounded by a dazzling array of technology. standard, roby, broussard, and melkonis are entering and finding their seats.}

<A>__{they begin to throw switches, lighting up their consoles. the control room starts to come to life. all around the room, colored lights flicker and chase each other across glowing screens. the room fills with the hum and chatter of machinery.}

<D>__{where's irth?}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{sandy, scan the whole sky.}
<A>__{melkonis hits buttons. on the screens the images all begin to pan. camera moves in on one of the screens, with its moving image of a starfield.}
