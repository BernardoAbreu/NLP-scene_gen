<L>__{exterior main street night}
<A>__{malcolm, sarah, kelly, nick and finally dr. juttson run out the front of the operations building. at the end of the street, they can see the helicopter as it descends slowly over the building, to land on its roof.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{there it is!}
<A>__{happily, the group double times it down the street, headed for the chopper. again, those strange rock formations are everywhere. some seem to be on the sides of buildings, as if they once dripped there and then turned to stone. this time sarah pauses at one that is dripping over to the side of a car like solidified lava. her face falls as a thought occurs to her.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{ian. it's guano.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{these formations. they're dried }
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{birdshit?}
<A>__{a velociraptors jumps onto a fallen tree trunk behind them. they don't see it.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{who cares? let's go!}
<A>__{unaware of the raptor's presence, they resume their trot toward the helicopter. behind them, the raptor crouches and snarls, but the sound is lost under the whine of the helicopter's engines. it springs, covering the distance between them quickly. the animal slams into juttson, the last person in the group, and takes him down. juttson is thrown forward, into the others, who fall like dominoes. juttson screams, his voice an unnatural, high pitched squeal, as the raptor flips him over and lowers its jaws into him. sarah looks up, panicked. her eyes widen at the sight of a second raptor, this one running straight at hr at top speed. she buries her face in the dirt, covering her head with her hands and the raptor's foot slams into the ground between her legs as it bounds over her and dives onto juttson, joining the first raptor in the kill. panicked, the group scatters in all directions. kelly jumps up and scrambles into the middle of the street, where she hits the dirt and crawls under a fallen shed in the middle of the road. malcolm rolls over to the space where kelly was, but she's gone now. he looks around frantically.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{kelly?! kelly?!}
<A>__{sarah rolls onto her feet and sprints toward the building nearest her. behind her, a third raptor gives chase, bounding after her with horrifying speed. sarah runs flat out, but her speed is nothing compared to the raptor's, and it gains on her rapidly. the walls of a structure of some kind close in around sarah, and as she leaps across a leather seat and slams a door behind her, we realize she's crawled into the back seat of an abandoned car. but the car door is thin protection against the charging raptor, which slams into the window, head first. the window spinderwebs, but does not yield. the raptor crumples to the ground. sarah looks up, through a three inch hole in the middle of the web. the raptor leaps back to its feet and plunges its nose into the tiny hole, thrashing, widening it. sarah screams and the animal forces its entire head through the hole, snapping its jaws just short of her face. she hurls herself over the seat and into the front as the animal penetrates even further into the car, but its torso will not fit through the window opening. it pulls away. in the front seat, sarah gets some very bad news. there's no windshield. the raptor springs up onto the hood, its claws clattering on the sheet metal, and tosses its body through the opening just as sarah hurls herself out the door. while the raptor struggles to right itself in the front seat, sarah runs to the nearest building, ducks inside, and slams the heavy wooden door.}
