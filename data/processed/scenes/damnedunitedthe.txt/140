<A>__{clough sits in make up. the door opens and austin mitchell, the same presenter as earlier, sticks his head round the corner..}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{thanks for agreeing to this.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{no problem.}
<A>__{clough smiles. uncharacteristically vulnerable.}
<C>__{clough }
<D>__{go easy on me, though. there's a good lad.}
<L>__{interior yorkshire tv studios day (1974)}
<A>__{clough is led into the studio, and onto the `calender' set, chatting to the sound man. clough's microphone is fixed, he is shown to his seat beside the presenter's. then clough notices a third (empty) seat beside his..}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{what's this? we expecting guests?}
<A>__{then clough looks up to see a distinctive blue blazer, with gold buttons approaching the set... blue blazer. don's blazer. clough's face falls as don revie and austin mitchell turn the corner, in conspiratorial conversation, and out to the seats.. it's a set up! clough looks over at austin mitchell and the crew, who shiftily avoids clough's eyes..}
<C>__{clough }
<D>__{you bastards!}
<A>__{revie is put in the seat beside clough. avoiding clough's eyes. revie rolls his neck, crosses his legs. vast, intimidating revie. ready for battle. suddenly, the theme music plays, the floor manager counts down..}
<C>__{floor manager}
<D>__{five, four, three..}
<A>__{the presenter looks up..}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{good evening. tonight the football world was stunned by the news that brian clough has been sacked as manager of leeds united. we'll be talking not just to brian clough, but also to the man he replaced, who's success he couldn't emulate, don revie.}
<A>__{mitchell turns to clough..}
<C>__{mitchell }
<D>__{to brian clough first of all. what's your reaction to being sacked in this fashion?}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{obviously, austin, my initial reaction is one of shock at finding myself here with revie...}
<C>__{revie}
<D>__{see? not so easy to make accusations when it's to someone's face...}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{...but in answer to your question, six weeks is hardly a long time to be given a chance in any job. i would hope revie would get a lot longer time in his.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{do you consider it was possible to step into your shoes, don revie? to replace you?}
<C>__{revie}
<D>__{being very, very honest, i think it was a difficult job for anyone to do. but i do feel brian clough, i won't call him clough because i won't take him down like that..}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{revie}
<D>__{...i do feel he made it harder for himself than he need have.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{how did i do that, don?}
<C>__{revie}
<D>__{shooting his mouth off about how dirty my players were.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{well, you were dirty, don!}
<C>__{revie}
<D>__{that's not true. the last four seasons, we've topped the charts for entertaining football.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{and before that, you also topped all the disciplinary charts. you should have been docked points and sent down to the second division.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{and in fact, you went on record and said so, brian clough. again and again. that leeds should, in fact, be relegated.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{and i was right.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{do you think that might have hurt your chances of success when you then came to manage them?}
<C>__{revie}
<D>__{of course it did! the things he said? why, man? why did you take the job in the first place?}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{because i thought it was the best job in the country.}
<C>__{revie}
<D>__{of course it was the best job in the country.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{i was taking over the league champions. 90aa}
<C>__{revie}
<D>__{you were. you were taking over the best bunch of players you'd ever seen.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{and i fancied winning the league, and winning europe, and doing it better than you.}
<C>__{revie}
<D>__{there's no way you could win it better.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{but that's the only hope i've got.}
<C>__{revie}
<D>__{i only lost four matches..}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{well, i can only lose three.}
<C>__{revie}
<D>__{no, no, no, no.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{and still play attractive, clean football. without cheating!}
<C>__{revie}
<D>__{see, there he goes again..}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{listening to you, i am struck that this is not just a business matter for you both. it's more than that. it's personal. am i right?}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{well, we're very different people, don and i. we have different styles. in football and in life. i'm a warm man. an idealist. i do believe in faeries, and that is my outlook. don is different. there's a hardness to him. a hardness. maybe he's not even aware of it. but he's a cold person.}
<C>__{revie}
<D>__{you don't know me!}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{and that lack of warmth. that coldness was there. permeated the club when i arrived.}
<C>__{revie}
<D>__{i totally refute that. the atmosphere at leeds was like a family. a happy family. you ask any of my players. i signed most of them personally. knew their backgrounds. their parents. their streets. i was a father to them. in that club every morning. massaging those boys. did you do that for them?}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{they would never have let me.}
<C>__{revie}
<D>__{did you try? you didn't even try. i soaped those boys down with my own hands. you just went to leeds with no thought for the club, no thought for the players. just on some kind of mad personal vendetta with me.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{well are you surprised? what else was i going to do?? after what you did...}
<C>__{revie}
<D>__{what did i do?}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{c'mon, don. you know exactly.}
<C>__{clough }
<D>__{4th march 1968. see? i even remember the date. you came to derby county, the third round of the fa cup, and you refused to shake my hand.}
<A>__{austin mitchell looks up. the cameramen look up.}
<C>__{revie}
<D>__{never! matter of principle! i always shake the other manager's hand!}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{you shook peter taylor's hand, and my trainer, jimmy gordon's.}
<C>__{revie}
<D>__{then i probably didn't see you!!}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{no, you saw me don. but considered me beneath you. looked down on me. and dismissed me. just like you did every other club and every other manager in the country.}
<C>__{revie}
<D>__{never would i knowingly refuse to shake a colleague's hand. the truth is, i probably just didn't know who you were.}
<C>__{clough}
<P>__{(a knowing smile)}
<D>__{"didn't know who i was!" pull the other one.}
<C>__{revie}
<D>__{it's the truth.}
<C>__{clough}
<P>__{(blurts out)}
<D>__{well, you certainly know it now.}
<A>__{all heads turn. that came out unintentionally loud.}
<C>__{revie}
<D>__{oh, we all know it now.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{we know you as the man who's constant outbursts, his defaming of fellow professionals, have brought this game, this beautiful game into disrepute. who had one of the best jobs in the country, at derby, and managed to get the sack. who had one of the best partners in the game, in peter taylor, and threw him away. who was given the greatest gift in british football leeds united, a team that in ten years hasn't finished outside the top four, and took them to the bottom of the first division. yes, it's fair to say we all know who you are now.}
<A>__{austin mitchell's eyes widen.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{ok, gentlemen, we're going to have to leave it there..}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{well, let's see where we are in a year's time, donald revie.}
<C>__{revie}
<D>__{dear oh dear..}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{let's see where we both are in five!}
<C>__{austin mitchell}
<D>__{that's it for tonight's show. i'd like to thank brian clough and don revie for joining me...}
<C>__{revie}
<D>__{thank you, austin.}
<A>__{the show wraps up. theme music starts playing. revie removes his microphone, turns and walks out. clough is left staring, hollow eyed. wishing the ground would swallow him up..}
