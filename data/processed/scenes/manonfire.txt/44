<A>__{creasy waits, smoking a marlboro light, separate from the other drivers and bodyguards. the bodyguards stand together sharing cigarettes and stories. give him a share of unfriendly looks. creasy could care less. the doors open and the children pour out. pinta exits, a huge grin as she spots creasy. creasy palms the marlboro. the frown on his might as well be chiseled in marble.}
