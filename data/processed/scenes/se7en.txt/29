<L>__{interior apartment crime scene, hallway morning}
<A>__{outside the door to the murder scene, mills and somerset cut through the restricted area crime scene seal.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{those bruises on the back of the victim's head were caused by the muzzle of a gun.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{so, the killer had him at gunpoint, and gave him a choice: eat, or get your head blown off.}
<L>__{interior apartment crime scene, kitchen morning}
<A>__{somerset and mills enter. somerset takes out the jar of plastic scrapings, turns on the now normal light. they begin to search.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{he was force fed... till his body started rejecting the food. he literally couldn't eat another bite.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{so, the killer held a bucket under him.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{his throat was swollen from the effort. he was bleeding internally. he must have blacked out... and, if you're the killer, you're not going to want to wait around for him to die.}
<A>__{somerset examines the counter tops and wall. mills gets down on his knees, examines the linoleum floor.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{you kick him, pop him like a fucking balloon.}
<P>__{(touches floor)}
<D>__{somerset, look here.}
<A>__{somerset gets down, holds the jar against the linoleum.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{same color and texture.}
<A>__{they both crawl on hands and knees, study every inch of floor.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{if this is what that is... it doesn't make sense. it doesn't figure.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{always look for one thing to focus on. there's always one singular thing, and it might be as small as a speck of dust, but find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{how are pieces of the floor going to get in the guy's stomach?}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{exactly. why would so many pieces be inside his stomach unless they were placed there intentionally?}
<A>__{somerset notices deep scratches in the linoleum, fingers the grooves. he takes a piece of plastic from the jar, holds it to the scratches, fiddles with it, fits it in. he looks up to see, these scratches are in front of the refrigerator. it looks like they were caused by the refrigerator having been pulled away from the wall and pushed back at some time.}
