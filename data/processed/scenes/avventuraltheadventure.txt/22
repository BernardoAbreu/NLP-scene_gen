<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{at the entrance way of a luxurious villa, claudia, who has just arrived, is greeted by the princess. she is an elderly woman, rather ordinary in appearance but very aristocratic in taste and manner.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{did you have a good trip? it is such a magnificent day! i am very happy that sicily is able to give you so warm a welcome. and you do deserve it. you're such a lovely blonde. come, my dear.}
<A>__{claudia smiles, and follows the princess into the garden.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{and where are you from?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{from rome.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{oh, how nice! so, you're from rome... and would you happen to know of some intelligent clergyman in rome who might be willing to come here and stay with us? we have our own private little chapel... it is a masterpiece, with seventeenth century frescoes... and the remains of all our dead ancestors, a wonderful collection... he would find it very convenient there, and could say his own masses. then he would have to spend a little time with my husband, who never sees anyone, to keep him occupied.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{an intelligent clergyman, princess? but i think the intelligent clergymen of today have so many other things to do.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{well, perhaps one with a little physical handicap. one who is slightly lame, for example.}
<A>__{in the meantime, they have arrived at a shady alcove where, seated in various wicker lounge chairs, are patrizia, giulia and a young man dressed in simple, casual clothes. the first one to notice claudia and to greet her with warm cordiality, is giulia.}
<C>__{giulia}
<D>__{well, finally! we were beginning to get worried about you, too.}
<A>__{claudia plunks herself down in one of the lounge chairs next to patrizia. the young man rises and bows slightly.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{but where did you finally end up?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{it was futile. we went all over.}
<A>__{there is a moment of silence; the thought of anna returns to weigh on the group. claudia pours herself an orange drink from a pitcher on the table beside her.}
<C>__{claudia}
<P>__{(referring to anna)}
<D>__{but why does she do these things?}
<P>__{(she takes a sip from her glass, then rises)}
<D>__{i can't stand it any more.}
<A>__{she takes a few steps, looks around at the villa, and at the other end of the alcove sees corrado and ettore saying goodbye to a pair of elderly gentlemen.}
<C>__{giulia}
<P>__{(to corrado and ettore)}
<D>__{but how can you carry on a discussion in this heat?}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{when one approaches fifty, my dear, he is affected only by the cold.}
<C>__{ettore}
<P>__{(noticing claudia)}
<D>__{and who is this?}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{this is claudia, anna's friend...}
<P>__{(to claudia)}
<D>__{you've never met my husband, have you?}
<A>__{ettore immediately recalls claudia's name from a previous conversation that was apparently held before she arrived.}
<C>__{ettore}
<D>__{by the way, have you phoned him?}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{you mean sandro? i told you already. he's not in. at least he's not at the hotel.}
<C>__{ettore}
<D>__{now look what has to go and happen... at a time when i will be needing him. how can we discuss things when we lack dates and figures?...}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{but didn't he say he was coming here...}
<A>__{now, with all this talk about sandro, the sense of relaxation claudia had felt upon her arrival, has changed into a feeling of anxiety that becomes more and more noticeable.}
<C>__{ettore}
<D>__{well, what are you all waiting for? send a car out to get him. he can't be more than a couple of hundred miles away...}
<C>__{giulia}
<D>__{to me, the fact that hasn't shown up is a good sign. do you want to bet that he's found anna?}
<C>__{ettore}
<D>__{maybe. but do you know that forty thousand persons a year disappear in italy without leaving a single trace behind them. forty thousand! almost as much as the entire population of san siro... raimondo, will you go and see if you can locate sandro?}
<C>__{raimondo}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{a gong announcing lunch resounds throughout the garden.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{first let the poor thing have something to eat.}
<C>__{ettore}
<D>__{it wouldn't really do you any harm to skip a meal.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{i've never met this sandro. what kind of a person is he?... he couldn't have done her in himself, by any chance?}
<C>__{ettore}
<P>__{(breaking out into a loud laugh)}
<D>__{sandro?... oh, sure... i can see sandro calling anna over to him and saying: listen, anna, i intend to get rid of you, but since it's so painful and complicated... and besides, i don't happen to have a gun on me... why don't you do me a favor and get rid of yourself on your own...}
<A>__{there is a moment of complete, dead silence, during which the same disturbing thought flashes across the minds of all those who are present like a sudden revelation.}
<C>__{giulia}
<D>__{my god, how could we joke over something like that! we should be ashamed of ourselves.}
<C>__{princess}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{come on, let's go.}
<A>__{they all get up except claudia. she is left so completely shaken by the conversation, by the thought, that it seems she no longer has the strength to move. giulia, after giving corrado a defiant look, turns and smiles at the young man who had stopped to wait for her.}
<C>__{giulia}
<P>__{(to claudia, referring to the young man)}
<D>__{goffredo is the princess' nephew. he's eighteen years old, the lucky boy. and, what do you know he paints.}
<C>__{goffredo}
<D>__{anybody can hold a brush in his hand. all you need is to buy some oils and start painting. even rembrandt did the same.}
<A>__{giulia laughs with a strange sense of excitement, then takes goffredo by the arm and leaves. claudia remains alone. she watches the group heading towards the house, giulia holding tight to goffredo, ettore to patrizia. their voices are heard, somewhat unclear.}
<C>__{ettore}
<D>__{but... where is the prince?... is he well?}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{the last time i saw him, the day before yesterday, it seemed he was well.}
<C>__{ettore}
<D>__{princess, why don't you sell this villa? i would turn it into a lovely psychiatric clinic.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{it's a little like that already.}
<A>__{finally, even claudia starts moving, slowly, behind the others; but she is still very much upset.}
