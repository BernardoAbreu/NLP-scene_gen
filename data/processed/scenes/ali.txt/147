<A>__{bingham takes pictures. sarria, rudy and the media in force are there for the start of ali's comeback. from behind ali's head gear ali spots...a figure step through the door. it's bundini. ali, seeing everything all the time, reacts not at all, turns his back. bundini is thin, drawn, stooped, but clear eyed. everyone turns. it takes tremendous courage for bundini to walk to the ring, expecting another rejection.}
