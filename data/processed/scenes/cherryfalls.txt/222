<A>__{leonard drives down the road. he smiles into his rear view mirror.}
<L>__{exterior street}
<A>__{in leonard's rear view mirror we see jody pedaling behind him. a couple of boys lean out of their cars and invite jody to the go to the party. sirens scream out in the distance.}
<L>__{exterior leonard's house}
<A>__{leonard pulls into his driveway. jody pulls in behind. she leans the bike on the front porch and they head into the house.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{you aren't going to the party?}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{you know about that too?}
<L>__{interior leonard's house}
<A>__{mr. leonard opens the door to his house. jody walks in behind him.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{of course. you're not scared?}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{of course i'm scared.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{then you should go.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{you think i should go to the party, mr. marliston?}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{i really do. for your own safety.}
<A>__{jody doesn't know what to make of this. it's not what she expected to hear from her teacher. leonard goes into the kitchen. jody sits on the couch and looks around. she's immediately sensing that something is off about the place. it's certainly not the way she imagined a teacher's house to look. it has all sorts of city plans, maps, and drawings on the walls. years of cherry falls yearbooks and newspapers are stacked in piles. he reappears with two beers and a pot filled with soapy water. he hands her a beer.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{i just feel so manipulated. by everyone. my dad, my boyfriend, and now some psychopath i don't even know.}
<A>__{she takes the beer, surprised he's giving her alcohol. he kneels down in front of her and begins to clean the wound on her leg.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{we're all manipulated. from the moment we're born. the event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before i was even born.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{yes. we have no real freedom. you of all people should understand that. this may sting.}
<A>__{jody is beginning to feel strange. there's something off kilter about this whole encounter.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{me? why me?}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{because of your father. the way what his sins shaped you.}
<A>__{he starts putting a disinfectant on her wound.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{what do you know about my father?}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{he's a rapist. like mine.}
<A>__{she grimaces. the disinfectant hurts.}
<C>__{jody}
<P>__{(a little scared) }
<D>__{your father raped someone?}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{lisa sherman was my mother. do you know who that is?}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{i was born nine months after she was raped. one of the four men who raped her is my father. i have no idea which one.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{you're the killed.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{yes that's the whole pointerior this is what i was put on this earth to do. rape the town that raped my mother. steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. i've planned this since i was a very little boy. you have no real freedom either. your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded.}
<A>__{jody gets up and starts backing away from him but he gets up quickly. he's not letting her get away. jody bolts for the door but she doesn't have time to open it. leonard grabs her and throws her across the room. jody smashes into a table. he bends down to pick her up, but she pulls a book case over on him, narrowly escaping. she runs for the back door.}
