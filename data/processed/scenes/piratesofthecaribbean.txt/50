<A>__{the jolly mon bobs its way across the bay, dwarfed against the h.m.s. dauntless. will holds a stay line with iron fists.}

<L>__{exterior h. m. s. dauntless main deck morning}
<A>__{there's been a breakdown in discipline; about a dozen navy sailors are gathered together on the main deck, playing dice. murtogg and mullroy among them. suddenly, jack and will jump out, into the open brandishing pistols.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{everybody stay calm. we're taking over the ship!}
<C>__{will}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{aye! avast!}
<A>__{jack gives him a look, shakes his head: don't do that. the sailors all look at them and then burst out laughing. they grin, shake their heads. jack stands there, grinning with them but his gun is still level. the lieutenant, gillette, steps forward.}
