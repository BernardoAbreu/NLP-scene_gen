<C>__{helen}
<D>__{did the suspect respond?}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{yes, he did?}
<C>__{helen}

<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{he started shooting through the door.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{the defendant fired six times, until his gun was empty. we would like to show you the weapon he used.}
<A>__{helen crosses to the prosecution table, picks up the .44. she holds it up for the jury to see.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{and we would like to enter it into court records. it was the same smith and wesson revolver he used to viciously murder george and carol beaman.}
<A>__{the .44 is duly entered into the records.}

<A>__{glances at "his" .44 as it passes into the bailiff's hands. it's a .44 all right.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{the prosecution would like to call mr. steven j. allen to the stand.}

<A>__{steven j. allen, a short balding bespectacled man in his fifties, crosses to the witness box where he is sworn in, then sits.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{mr. allen, would tell the court what you do.}
<C>__{steven j. allen}
<D>__{i am a lab technician for the police department. one of my duties is to examine weapons used in violent crimes.}
<A>__{clyde's attention is on helen's legs. he's bored by the proceedings, but something suddenly strikes him. he looks at the .44 smith and wesson on the evidence table. there is no black stain on the handle.}
<C>__{steven j. allen}
<D>__{i tested the defendant's revolver and matched the bullets fired to the bullets removed from the deceased.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{that ain't my gun.}
<A>__{all attention turns to clyde. his attorney, the judge, the jury, helen, everybody is surprised by the sudden statement.}
<C>__{judge weinberg}
<D>__{i must remind the defendant that he is not to speak out when }
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{that ain't my gun!}
<A>__{the judge taps her gavel. john oblinger puts a hand on clyde's arm. clyde pulls it away. and now things happen very fast.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{that ain't my fuckin' gun!}
<A>__{and clyde is moving toward the gun. and the bailiff and guards are moving toward clyde. and helen is moving out of the way. and the judge is standing, banging her gavel. and the jury is scared.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{you're tryin' to fuckin' frame me!}
<A>__{clyde grabs for the gun as the bailiff and guards grab for clyde. clyde turns and decks the bailiff and all hell breaks lose.}

<D>__{it ain't my fuckin' gun!}
