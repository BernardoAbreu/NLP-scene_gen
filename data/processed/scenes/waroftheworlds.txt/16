<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{holy shit!}
<A>__{high shot shows the bridge behind ray's house being blasted away. the expressway gets hit by the beams and overturns into the houses below. one of them ray's. an explosion is seen as a fuel tanker falls on ray's house that obliterates 4 houses. flaming debris flies all over behind the van. the van has now made it on to the freeway where hundreds of cars are scattered all over the road broken down. the van speeds by them honking the horn every few cars.}

<A>__{rachel makes his demonstrated arm formation.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{make the arms. (he grabs her elbows so she holds the position. he begins to calm her down) this space right here, this is yours.}
<A>__{robbie stares directly into her eyes. she takes deep breaths to regain control. she is able to open her eyes and stare back into his eyes to maintain contact.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{... this belongs to you, right?}

<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{i'm gonna go to the front seat to talk to dad...}
