<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{underwater}
<A>__{the class, paired up, is drifting down; sparky offering encouragement as they descend. andrews and crosby are already disappearing, swimming away with strong kicks.}
<B>__{following andrews and crosby}
<A>__{as they go over the edge of a shelf and drop into darker, deeper waters. crosby checks his depth, his watch, looks around...}
<B>__{his point of view}
<A>__{far above him, the class, going about their business. below him, murk, depth, and suddenly, a big lunker bass. andrews sees it, too. angle on andrews assuming crosby is following, he takes off, following the big lunker. crosby, hung up in some minor equipment problem, misses seeing him go. the two men are separated. follow andrews as he twists and turns after the bass, going deeper, losing him in the rocks, suddenly rounding a boulder, and meeting, almost face to face, horror:}
<B>__{below him the shark}
<A>__{the great white shark, taking the striper in a single gulp, it's looking up at andrews with one glassy doll's eye; it turns to face him directly, and we see the scar; ugly, red and black, charred flesh from jaw back on the right side, eyes and teeth gleaming like raw bone in the massive, uncaring face. andrews' mouth clamps violently on his mouthpiece, then goes wide as he screams in fear into the water. finning backwards, he ditches his weights, gulps for air, and yanks the cord on his safety vest. it balloons out, and pulls him up, surging towards the surface. the mouthpiece, useless, falls away from his lips. eyes closed, hose dangling, andrews hurtles upward, holding his breath in a final, fatal panic, passing a startled crosby.}
<B>__{the divers}
<A>__{look over at the rocketing ascent. what's wrong? sparky signals "up," and they begin to carefully follow him towards the surface. crosby's already surfacing.}
