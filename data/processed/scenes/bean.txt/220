<A>__{inside, bean is casually pouring the entire contents of david's large laxative tin into buck's coffee. he also swaps two keys on the board of keys by the desk. he then takes the opportunity to put the oven gloves on his feet, one shaped like a pig, one like a crocodile, so he can move silently. buck returns. he sits down, and takes a long gulp of coffee. pause. bean watches. buck feels something uncomfortable in his stomach. he takes a key from his rack of keys, and sets off and rounds a corner on a monitor screen, bean watches him break into a canter as he passes through another monitor buck is at full sprinterior bean giggles. bean is satisfied he'll be uninterrupted for a while. he goes to the key rack, borrows two keys, and sets off on his mission. the next 3 minutes of film are a sequence of cuts between three scenarios: first: buck his next 10 minutes are not happy ones. when he reaches the toilet, the key he chose does not unlock it. he has to sprint back, grab all the keys, and charge back again to the door. then he has to try out every single key. we never see him find the right one. second scenario all the activities of the night shown on the security monitors. buck sprinting desperately through shot bean casually going about his business and, on one occasion, buck running right past bean, but not seeing him he has other things on his mind. third scenario we actually see bean's big plan. he unlocks the merchandise shop. so he can see properly and have his hands free, he puts the y fronts on his head, and wedges the torch into them, like a head lamp. he then takes a poster of whistler's mother and replaces it with the rolled up tennis ball girl. he unrolls the whistler and places the 4 encyclopaedias on its corners to hold it down. he separates the yokes from the eggs, mixes the whites with clear nail varnish and varnishes the poster with it. dries it off with the hair drier. ,with the now stiff poster, he heads up elevators and escalators to get to the whistler room itself, all the time chewing gum frantically. once there, he unlocks the final cupboard with david's plastic key, takes the whistler down and removes the destroyed mother from its gilded frame, and its wooden support frame. he uses the chewed gum to stick the new one down to the old frame. he then puts the very convincing forgery back into the security cupboard and relocks it with david's key card. the job is done. he scrunches up the old, torn picture, pops it in a dustbin, and heads off.}
