<L>__{interior dressing room day}
<A>__{thirty completely wiped out athletes. some are too tired to shower, some have made it that far, but are too tired to change. pienaar has showered and changed and slumps next to his locker. the springbok manager enters, followed by the rugby}
<B>__{president.}
<A>__{pienaar and the boys drag themselves upright. the rugby president looks them over as if they were his very own stable of race horses a stable he's not entirely sure he likes.}
<C>__{rugby president}
<D>__{afternoon men. it's good to see you working so hard. i have a short announcement.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{as part of the pr buildup to the world cup, you will be conducting coaching clinics in townships all over the country.}
<A>__{the players greet this announcement with complete silence.}
<C>__{rugby president}
<D>__{i know you have plenty on your plates already but this is a request that comes from the top.}
<P>__{(looking at pienaar, pointedly)}
<D>__{the very top.}
<A>__{the rugby president turns on his heel, and leaves, followed by the manager. the players say nothing for a long moment, but body language alone shows that they are completely disgusted.}
<C>__{springbok hooker}
<D>__{this is complete crap.}
<C>__{springbok flank}
<D>__{are we some kind of circus act now?}
<C>__{springbok lock}
<D>__{we don't have time for kuk like this.}
<A>__{the boys are getting angrier by the second.}
<C>__{springbok lock}
<D>__{they expect us to play our best, to give our bloody all, then they add to our bloody workload ...}
<A>__{the lock turns to chester.}
<C>__{springbok lock}
<D>__{what do you think about this, chester?}
<A>__{all eyes on chester, as if the poor guy is a magic guide to a world they barely understand.}
<C>__{chester williams}
<D>__{i try not to think. it interferes with my rugby.}
<A>__{the perfect answer for these guys.}
<C>__{springbok lock}
<D>__{see! now there's a rugby player. talk to them francois.}
<C>__{springbok wing}
<D>__{make them see that this is a waste of time we don't have.}
<A>__{all eyes on their captain who shakes his head, no.}
<C>__{pienaar}
<D>__{i'm not going to talk to them.}
<C>__{springbok flank}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{pienaar}
<D>__{whether we like it or not, we're more than just a rugby team. we're ... we're ambassadors inside our own country. and we might as well get used to it.}
<A>__{silence. rebellious silence. then:}
<C>__{springbok lock}
<D>__{is this you speaking, or mandela?}
<A>__{pienaar's eyes are fierce. he needs them to see how serious he is.}
<C>__{pienaar}
<D>__{you know me better than that.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{times change. we need to change, too.}
<A>__{it is clear that much of his team disagrees with him.}
