<L>__{interior george's manufactured home day}
<A>__{an empty hallway. psychedelic sound plays. nick comes around the corner, literally floating down the hall. he breaststrokes through the air toward us.}
<L>__{interior george and lacey's room day}
<A>__{he passes just under the door frame and comes down, feet touching carpet. he looks into the mirror and finds francois lounging on the bed behind him.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{my god, francois! what was paul smoking?}
<C>__{francois}
<D>__{shut up and go with it.}
<A>__{nick shrugs and opens the top dresser drawer, revealing lacey's lingerie. nick starts dancing, doing a strip tease for himself. we pan around the room, and when we reach nick again, he's wearing nothing but a pair of lacey's thongs. he models in front of the mirror, regarding his bulging t.e. he removes a c cup bra and holds it high. he uses the elastic straps to fasten the bra onto his head. he starts dancing up a storm to the cheesy vengaboys rendition of brazil in his head. waving arms. bicycling leg movements. as he backs up we can see that george is watching him from the doorway, a safeway bag in his arms. lacey peers over his shoulder. the music halts abruptly.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what the... what the hell?}
<A>__{nick gives a startled jump.}
<C>__{lacey}
<D>__{is..? is that my bra?}
