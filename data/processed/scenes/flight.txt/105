<A>__{a man stands at a podium wearing a coat and tie. he is lost in the energized retell of a story.}
<D>__{a.a. speaker # 1 the cop is shining his flashlight on me. i'm standing there behind the dumpster, wearing nothing but my girlfriend's panties, vomit on my chest and i say to the cop...about two beers.}
<A>__{the room erupts with laughter. nicole is really taken by the candor of the speaker as she joins the room in laughter.}
<P>__{a.a. speaker # 1 (cont'd)}
<D>__{that's why they call me "two beer" barry.}
<A>__{barry makes eye contact with a stern looking old timer. barry holds up a loose leaf binder and addresses the man...}
<P>__{a.a. speaker # 1 (cont'd)}
<D>__{don't worry ed, i got the format right here. i'm sorry, ed's giving me the stink eye. let me get back to the format...}
<P>__{(reads from the format)}
<D>__{i'm barry. i'm an alcoholic.}
<C>__{the assembly}
<P>__{(in unison)}
<D>__{hi barry. a.a. speaker # 1 are there any other alcoholics present?}
<A>__{whip glances around to find himself in a sea of raised handed alcoholics. a few look at whip with no judgement.}
<P>__{a.a. speaker # 1 (cont'd)}
<D>__{i like meetings that have us all identify. because it makes me tell the truth about who i am. it reminds that i never ever told the truth. i lied about everything. my whole life had been a lie. and i was told that i would never get sober if i kept lying.}
<A>__{whip is very reserved, poker faced.}
<D>__{a.a. speaker #1 i mean, lying's what i'm good at. if i know anything in this life it's how to lie, especially about my drinking. we pan the faces and everyone seems immediately connected. except whip who leans over to nicole.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{i gotta go. okay?}
<P>__{(nicole nods)}
<D>__{can uh...}
<P>__{(points to sheila)}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{yeah, sheila. she can take me back to work.}
<C>__{sheila}
<P>__{(extends her hand)}
<D>__{i'm sheila. whip shakes her hand before quickly escaping as if from a fire. we stay close on whip's face as he walks out. barry continues his pitch. a.a. speaker #1 like i said, i would lie about everything. it didn't matter what it was. my whole life had been a lie. a series of lies strung together by me. and when i drank? it was worse. what i came to understand was that, my lies were killing me. and that remains the great fact for me...my lies will kill me.}
<A>__{whip is gone.}
