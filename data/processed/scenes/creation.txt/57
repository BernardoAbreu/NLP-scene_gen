<L>__{interior woodlands. the past. day}
<A>__{darwin is ten years younger, pacing in the same, measured way through summer woodland. there's a noise behind him and he turns, finger to his lips for silence. annie turns away from him and passes the sign down the line of children: etty, george, betty and franky, in decreasing order of height.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{shh}
<C>__{franky}
<P>__{(to annie)}
<D>__{what are we looking at?}
<A>__{the question comes back up the line}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{a weasel.}
<A>__{the children bunch up to gaze on a strange and wonderful sight. in a little sun dappled clearing a weasel is turning loop the loops in a strange spiralling dance for the benefit of... ...a young rabbit, which sits utterly hypnotized by the performance. at first its strange and amusing, then the dance becomes more sinister. the weasel advancing by tiny increments as it tumbles in the air, finally}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{the weasel seizes the bunny rabbit by the back of the neck and shakes it savagely. the rabbit shrieks and spasms. annie is beside herself, drumming the ground with her feet in a fever of fear and pity. the rabbit is still in its dearth throes, its neck broken, its back legs still jerking}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{no! no! stop it. daddy. stop it. make it stop.}
<A>__{the rabbit is already dead.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{annie, annie, annie.}
<A>__{he sinks to his knees, heedless of the mud on his sunday best worsted, embracing her. the others are shocked and amazed by the rabbits death, but none of them distressed as annie. they are country children and death is an everyday event}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{the chickens do that too when cookie kills them}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(tearful furious)}
<D>__{chickens are different!}
<P>__{(to her father)}
<C>__{annie }
<D>__{why didn't you do something. you should have stopped it!}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{the weasel has to eat. its the way of the world. annie}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{its not fair. its not fair.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{no, its not fair at all.}
<A>__{patting her and stroking her as the little sobs subside. the weasel is dragging the dead rabbit back to its lair.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{....but still it is extraordinary, do you not think, that a weasel should learn to dance the polka.}
<A>__{despite herself the concept amuses annie. chest still heaving with sobs she dries her eyes and smiles at him through her tears.}
