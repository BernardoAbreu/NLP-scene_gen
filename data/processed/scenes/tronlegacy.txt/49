<L>__{exterior old game grid}
<A>__{rush steps across the vast vector graphic grid surface. eerie. quiet. pure. mega, i beem, krod and d rezz follow.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{this region is obsolete.}
<A>__{rush kneels, touches grid lines. circuits energize, as his energy surges in all directions. he draws in data.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{there's bits of tron's code all over. krod, give d rezz and i beem the escape coordinate tron used on me.}
<A>__{krod's eyes flash data to i beem and d rezz. "tr165444.018".}
<D>__{i beem coordinate captured.}
<A>__{d rezz nods, palming his romball.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{that's where tron will bail out. we'll make sure he needs to. go set up the trap.}
<P>__{(to d rezz)}
<D>__{you only get one shot at this, big guy. stop him but don't destroy him, right? he's got data i need.}
<A>__{d rezz grips romball, grunts affirmation. he and i beem head for the perimeter of the grid.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{if this is tron's territory, he'll know we're here. he'll hide.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{he can't resist a grudge match. he'll take risks trying to beat me. that's how we trip him up.}
<P>__{(to krod)}
<D>__{whip it out.}
<A>__{rush unsheathes his light wand. krod pulls out his own light wand. they both look at mega. she's got no light wand.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{you didn't bring one?}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{i don't have one.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{hey, not a problem }
<A>__{krod holds his light wand forward, activates it. light cycle up rezzes under him. he revs it, ready to go.}
<C>__{krod}
<P>__{(to mega)}
<D>__{ hop on!}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{hang on, krod.}
<A>__{rush activates his light wand. light cycle up rezzes under him, with a special two tier seat for a second rider.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{i upgraded my unit.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{you are awesome, man. i hate you.}
<A>__{mega considers. there's more on her mind she's not talking about. she smiles at rush, climbs on back of his light cycle.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{mmmm... hack me.}
<A>__{a nod between rush and rush they take off. light cycles shoot across grid surface. mega screams and clutches rush, throwing her body against his, clamping her arms around him. krod and rush turn 90 degrees, rallying, passing each other, getting warmed up. it's familiar territory. light cycles race toward each other on the same line. mega holds rush tight, eyes filling with terror.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{resource conflict! fatal crash imminent!}
<A>__{but krod and rush slow their light cycles with expert skill, rolling safely to a halt, nose to nose. directly over: a big red dot. the only dot on the grid. grid center. mega, rush and krod raise up to scan the horizon. it's all clear flat grid to the horizon.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{any sign of him?}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{everything looks the same to me. everything looks the same. the same. the same.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{krod, snap out of it.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{tron will never expose himself.}
<A>__{they watch, wait, pivot.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{the same...}
