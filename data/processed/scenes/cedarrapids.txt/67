<L>__{exterior silo adventure park day (late afternoon)}
<A>__{the sun is low. long, phallic shadows are cast by a series of}
<L>__{70 foot silos which are covered with thick sheets of ice.}
<A>__{tim and joan run up to orin, who is waiting by the silos.}
<C>__{orin}
<D>__{ok guys, this is it. first team to complete this challenge wins the whole shootin' match.}
<P>__{(unfurls a scroll, reads)}
<D>__{asmi's past is behind us; but our future looks nice; let's build a bridge to the 22nd century... by scaling this silo of ice!}
<A>__{some dudes with ice climbing equipment ropes, picks, etc. appear. tim looks petrified. joan shakes her head.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{that doesn't even... there's no such thing as silo ice climbing.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{no, it's actually a big thing in iowa. abc news did a story about it. i saw it on youtube.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{of course you did. well, you can do it then...}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{uh uh, absolutely not. i'm scared crapless of heights.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{you need to get over it, lippe, cuz i'm not climbing jack.}
<C>__{joan }
<D>__{come on insurance man leap tall buildings in a single bound and all that...}
<A>__{tim's nostrils flair. just then, mike pyle and his partner arrive. tim looks to the top of the silo. it is dizzyingly high. he shuts his eyes for a moment, exhales.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{yeah. let's do this thing.}
<A>__{orin turns on a boom box, which blasts some triumphant music (whitesnake's here i go again, perhaps). quick cuts: the dudes get tim and mike pyle into their climbing gear harnesses, helmets, crampons. and they start climbing. sort of. tim jams his pick into the ice. he tries to pull himself up, but can't. mike fares worse. he can't even get his pick to stick in the ice.}
<C>__{tim }
<D>__{hang on... how's it...?}
<C>__{mike pyle}
<D>__{little help here...}
<A>__{the dudes shout instructions. tim and mike try again. to no avail. neither could do a pull up if his life depended on it. a little while later all the contestants have shown up. but not a damn one of them can get more than a foot off the ground.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{ugh. this is frickin' hard.}
<C>__{ronald}
<D>__{really hard.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{i think i just shit my pants.}
<A>__{joan cheers. orin looks to the dudes, who shrug. a little while later orin talks on his cell phone, conferring. the contestants wait in a field, shivering. the sun is getting lower. orin hangs up, sighs, shuts off the uplifting music.}
<C>__{orin}
<D>__{ok gang, that was rick martini with the national chapter. here's the deal. since no one could do the final task, and since joan and tim were the first team to get here, we're just gonna go ahead and award them the first place prize. unless anyone's got a problem with that?}
<A>__{ronald mutters to himself, frustrated with his performance.}
<C>__{ronald}
<D>__{dangit. you could've done better, wilkes.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{wait, we won?}
<C>__{orin}
<D>__{yup. so here you guys go. your $75 gift card for the westdale mall.}
<A>__{orin hands joan the gift card. despite the anticlimax, tim is overjoyed. he picks up joan and spins her around. everyone else just wanders away.}
