<L>__{into the air!}
<A>__{the speedboat shoots out from beneath the dock! indiana lands directly on top of the speedboat! a spectacular stunt! helmut points his gun at indy. indy reacts with a swift kick to helmut's jaw. the nazi hits the deck. out cold. klaus comes for indy. they begin to fight. an angry gutterbuhg tries to shoot... but indy and klaus move too quickly! gutterbuhg can't get a clear shot. the model t has come to a stop. safe. its front wheels teeter over the dock's edge. scraggy, betsy and clare get out. clare catches her breath. knees shaking. betsy is still laughing.}

<D>__{about time we had some fun!}
<A>__{a worried scraggy sees indiana, fighting with the nazis.}
<C>__{scraggy}
<D>__{bad spirits have indy! he in trouble! big trouble!}
<A>__{scraggy runs off screen. the nazi speedboat is headed toward the side of an enormous ocean liner! gutterbuhg radios for help. indiana and klaus continue to fight. rolling along the deck. exchanging punches. a bound tyki watches with wide eyes. helpless. the speedboat makes a sudden sharp turn. avoiding a collision with the ocean liner. indiana and klaus tumble off, the boat! into the water!}
<B>__{underwater}
<A>__{indiana and klaus continue their battle. they wrestle only a few feet from the ship's large, spinning steel propellers. the propellers create a suction force. drawing indy and klaus closer... closer... toward a spinning death. indy and klaus grab hold of a dangling, steel anchor. preventing their bodies from being sucked into the propellers. klaus pulls a switchblade from his pocket. he attacks indy's clenched fingers with the knife. indy begins to lose his grip. his body inches toward the propellers. klaus raises the knife, to finish off indiana... but klaus' untied shoelace dangles beside the propellers. the shoelace catches a spinning blade. the shocked nazi is pulled into the propellers! indiana turns away, holding tightly to the anchor. a blood red cloud surges through the surrounding water. indiana climbs the anchor to safety.}
<B>__{above water}
<A>__{indiana surfaces. taking a gulp of air. suddenly, the water in front of him erupts with machine gun fire. indiana sees gotterbuhg! he has parked the nazi speedboat only a few feet away. gutterbuhg smiles, pointing his finger at the helpless indiana. a sitting duck. gutterbuhg smiles.}
<C>__{gutterbuhg}
<D>__{goodnight, doctor jones.}
<A>__{there is a loud gunshot! gutterbuhg's mechanical arm is hit by a bullet! pieces of spring, metal and sprockets fly from the wound. gutterbuhg turns. furious. dashiell, the nightclub owner, is a few feet away. he is driving a sleek speedboat, its side adorned with the american flag. dashiell points a pistol at gutterbuhg, ready to take another shot... with a roar, the nazi speedboat drives away! toward a cluster of docks! indiana climbs into dashiell's speedboat.}
<C>__{dashiell}
<D>__{scraggy said you might be needing some help, sport.}
<A>__{dashiell hits the gas. tearing after the nazis. a frenzied, high speed chase begins! through the darkness. beneath the rows of docks. the speedboats face countless obstacles. they swerve around a virtual forest of wooden poles, which fly by at breakneck speed! the men duck and dodge dangling fish hooks and nets. many paths are blocked by the wooden rafts and rowboats. (note: because of the darkness, these obstacles appear only when they are a few feet ahead of the speedboats. this makes the chase completely surprising and scary, causing a funhouse effect.) throughout the chase, indiana and the nazis continue to exchange gunfire. a frustrated gutterbuhg can't shoot. his mechanical machine gun arm rendered useless by dashiell's bullet. he continues to radio nazi headquarters for help. dashiell catches up with the nazis. the two speedboats travel side by side. their edges scrape together. sparks fly. the recovered helmut aims his luger at indiana... but indy leaps toward the nazi. the two fall. rolling. tumbling. struggling for the gun. they fight between the two speedboats. the crack below them slightly opening and closing. up ahead, an enormous stone pole appears. to avoid a collision, the speedboats must separate. dashiell screams.}
<C>__{dashiell}
<D>__{indy! rollout!}
<A>__{indy frees himself from helmut and rolls back onto dashiell's boat. helmut looks up. he sees the stone pole ahead. coming at him. helmut tries to move...too late. the two boats separate. helmut smacks into the pole! crushed! dashiell turns away from the wheel, looking at indiana.}
<C>__{dashiell}
<D>__{you okay, sport?}
<A>__{indiana begins to answer...then sees something. ahead. he screams.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{dash!...}
<A>__{dashiell turns back. the speedboat is headed straight for a solid wooden wall! a sign on the wall reads: futterman's fishing warehouse. the nazi speedboat has already made a sharp turn, avoiding the warehouse. there's no time for dashiell to turn. indy hits the deck. the speedboat arches upward, at an angle... crash! the speedboat blasts into the warehouse. splintered wood splatters through the air.}
