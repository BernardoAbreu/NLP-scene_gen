<L>__{exterior dante's inferno day}
<A>__{outside, greg is still nowhere to be found. benz, stilts, and laurie have piled into their car, waiting for nick to take the wheel.}
<B>__{nick and alex}
<A>__{are up by greg's skylark.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{so where is he?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{guess he took off... you have his keys, right?}
<A>__{alex holds them up and gives them a shake.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{hmmm. he said you were going to have dinner?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{so take his car home. wait. i'm sure he's up to something...}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(cutting him off)}
<D>__{but he was playing the game. i mean, you saw him...}
<A>__{behind them, laurie reaches over the seat and honks nick's horn. laurie and the others burst into laughter. stilts sets his skateboard on the street and rolls it towards nick.}
<B>__{back to nick and alex}
<A>__{nick stops the board with his foot and steps onto it, balancing. he waves to the others and turns back to alex.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{it's nothing, okay? just take his car home. he'll show up.}
<A>__{nick tousles alex's hair. he shakes his arcade cartridge at her.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{don't worry about it.}
<A>__{and with that, nick's off, rolling back to his car and leaping over the door, skateboard and all. laurie and the others are still screaming with laughter. nick hits the ignition and guns the car, pulling out with a dramatic screech and sailing off down the street.}
<B>__{on alex}
<A>__{clutching greg's car keys. she glances on the front seat, where her own arcade cartridge rests.}
<B>__{the cartridge}
<A>__{has the same glowing eyes that were laser etched on the machine inside the inferno.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{fuck you.}
