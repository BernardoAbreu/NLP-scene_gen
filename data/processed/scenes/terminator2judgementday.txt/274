<L>__{136a the front door is kicked in.}
<A>__{terminator steps inside. john grabs his sleeve and pushes past him. he scopes out the situation in two seconds... sarah, the gun, the sobbing family. john moves to sarah while terminator checks dyson. john kneels in front of his mother. she raises her head to look at him. he sees the tears spilling down her cheeks,}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{mom? you okay?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i couldn't... oh, god.}
<P>__{(she seems to she him for the first time)}
<D>__{you... came here... to stop me?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<A>__{she reaches out and takes his shoulder suddenly, surprising him... drawing him to her. she hugs him and a great sob wells up deep inside her, from a spring she had thought long dry. she hugs him fiercely as the sobs wrack her. john clutches her shoulders. it is all he ever wanted.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{it's okay. it'll by okay. we'll figure it out.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i love you, john. i always have.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i know, mom. i know.}
<A>__{tarissa looks around at the bizarre tableau. terminator has wordlessly ripped open dyson's shirt and examined the wound.}
<C>__{terminator}
<D>__{clean penetration. no shattered bone. compression should control the loss of blood.}
<A>__{he takes tarissa's hands and presses them firmly over the entrance and exit wounds.}
<C>__{terminator}
<D>__{do you have bandages?}
<C>__{dyson}
<D>__{in the bathroom. danny, can you get them for us?}
<A>__{danny nods and runs down the hall. john disengages from sarah. she wipes her tears, the instinct to toughen up taking over again. but the healing moment has had its effect, nevertheless. john walks toward dyson and terminator.}
<C>__{dyson}
<D>__{who are you people?}
<A>__{john draws the biker's knife from terminator's boot. hands it to him.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{show him.}
<A>__{terminator takes off his jacket to reveal bare arms. john takes blythe by the hands and leads her down the hall, away from what is about to happen.}
