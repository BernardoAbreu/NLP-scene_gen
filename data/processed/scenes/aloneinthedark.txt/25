<L>__{interior museum main hall day 18}
<A>__{the high ceilinged main hall of the museum. glass display cases are set up to showcase archeological artifacts. aline cedrac (late 20s), studious but dynamic, stands in front of a display case. she carries a clipboard. a heavy set guard (early 50s) approaches, followed by a delivery guy (late 20s), who hauls in a crate on a dolly.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{got another delivery, ms. cedrac.}
<A>__{aline checks her clipboard.}
<C>__{aline}
<D>__{i don't have anything scheduled. what museum was it transferred from?}
<A>__{the delivery guy reads the information on his clipboard.}
<C>__{delivery guy}
<D>__{for dr. hudgens, from dr. hudgens.}
<C>__{aline}
<D>__{it's probably an error. it must be for the big abkani show.}
<C>__{delivery guy}
<D>__{abkani? what the hell's abkani?}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{ancient native american civilization. they were this super advanced culture, but something like ten thousand years ago, they just disappeared.}
<C>__{line}
<D>__{you've been reading up.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{not much else to do around here at night.}
<A>__{aline picks up a crowbar and approaches the crate.}
<C>__{delivery guy}
<D>__{says here it's not to be opened by anyone but dr. hudgens.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{this is aline cedrac. she's the assistant curator.}
<C>__{aline}
<D>__{we've got abkani artifacts coming in from museums around the world. until hudgens gets back, i'm doing all the cataloguing anyway.}
<A>__{aline pries open the lid of the crate with the crow bar. out of the packing foam, aline lifts up a heavy stone tablet carved with elaborate abkani symbols. aline holds it up, fascinated.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{where is hudgens anyway? the show opens in a few days.}
<C>__{aline}
<D>__{off on another archeological goosechase. he thinks he's finally found the erebus.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{so he sticks you with the work. at least it keeps your mind off your boyfriend.}
<A>__{aline pleasant expression suddenly turns awkward.}
<C>__{line}
<D>__{i will be in my office if you need me.}
<A>__{aline quickly walks off, taking the stone tablet with her.}
<C>__{delivery guy}
<D>__{what was that all about?}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{damn it... i shouldn't have said that. her boyfriend's been missing for the last three months.}
<A>__{delivery guy shakes his head at the guard.}
<C>__{delivery guy}
<D>__{nice going, jack ass.}
