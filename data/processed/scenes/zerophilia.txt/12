<L>__{exterior muddy waters' mini mart night}
<A>__{a tanker truck quakes past. surrounded by fir trees, the eerily empty mini mart glows with fluorescent junk food. inside mini mart luke stands behind the cash register, leafing through "the outdoors man." the chime bings and sydney enters, early thirties, elegant in thrift store chic. she's cool and in control, ...at least on the outside. she surveys random candy bars, stealing glances at luke.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{had a sudden intense craving for a cherry popsicle.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you can check in that freezer.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{what a relief. i'm sydney. you?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{luke.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{workin' late, huh? luke?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{yeah, four am. it sucks.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{sometimes you guys are just unfathomably stupid.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{why in the world do guys say "it sucks" as if it were a bad thing? i mean, every guy's dying to get a blow job, right? so, you think they'd treat those words with profound respect, like holy scripture. "what an unbelievable sunset, honey: doesn't it just suck?,"... "you won an olympic gold medal?!, that blows!"}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i guess you're right.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{it must be great at your age. that river of testosterone coursing through your veins, the damn about to burst! how about we just lock this place up and go for an olympic gold?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no thanks. jeez, lady.}
<A>__{disappointed, she checks her reflection in the freezer door.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i ought to dye my hair. don't you think?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{uh, i don't know. looks fine.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{your hair is such an incredible color.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{it's brown.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i love it. do you think i could cut just a little piece? match the color? it really "sucks."}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{nah, c'mon. you're messin' with me.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i'm not. i love it. you really should get rid a' that thing, anyway. i have clippers in my bag.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what thing?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{cowlick. right here. see? i can just snip it off.}
<A>__{she snips his hair. luke pulls away.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{what's the matter? don't you like being touched? don't you like being a guy?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no. i mean,... what? sorry, but you're just bizarre.}
<A>__{she chuckles, lays money on the counter.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{may be. but i learned long ago, you can't change your true nature, even if it can change you.}
<A>__{as she leaves, she takes a provocative bite of the popsicle.}
