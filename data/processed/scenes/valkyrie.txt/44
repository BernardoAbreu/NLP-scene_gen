<D>__{five thousand ships, one hundred thousand men from the combined allied forces.}
<A>__{haeften and stauffenberg ride in a sedan. stauffenberg is in profile the entire time.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{what about the panzer divisions in }
<C>__{haeften}
<D>__{they were never dispatched. word is hitler took a sleeping pill. his staff was afraid to wake him.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{first africa, now france.}
<C>__{haeften}
<D>__{the russians bearing down from the east.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{sometimes i wonder if hitler's real aim is to leave nothing but scorched earth for all of europe.}
<A>__{stauffenberg rubs his forehead. the car stops. soldiers are waiting outside. stauffenberg gets out of the car wearing an ornate dress uniform and carrying a leather valise. he has arrived at a meeting of great importance. he turns to face haeften directly and we are surprised to see both of his eyes for an instant the young lion he once was. but a closer look is unsettling we see the faint scarring, one eye glowing and alive, the other cloudy and dead. his glass eye. stauffenberg only wore it on special occasions. this is one.}
<C>__{haeften}
<D>__{maybe this is a blessing in disguise. maybe he'll finally listen to reason consider a truce while he still can.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{we'll see if i can't convince him.}
