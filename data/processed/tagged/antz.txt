<D>__{all my life, i've lived and worked in the big city...}
<A>__{we see:}
<L>__{exterior an ant mound day}
<A>__{the camera swoops towards the entrance, then dives inside, past a couple of tough looking soldier ants who stand at the gates of the ant colony like insect bouncers...into an access tunnel that snakes this way and that, past a row of ants plodding along... ...and into the main chamber of the colony, a huge, teeming vista that seems to stretch away forever, filled with ants rushing here and there on their business. we see a "traffic cop" directing foot traffic, waving his arms like crazy so both sides move at once a column of soldier ants marching along in formation a chain of ants letting down a matchbox elevator filled with workers.}
<C>__{z }
<D>__{...which is kind of a problem, since i've always felt uncomfortably in crowds.}
<L>__{interior motivational counsellor's office day}
<A>__{we join z, a worker ant with issues. he's lying on a couch, recounting his woes.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{i feel...isolated. different. i've got abandonment issues. my father flew away when i was just a larva. my mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i feel physically inadequate i've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight. sometimes i think i'm just not cut out to be a worker. but i don't have any other options. i was assigned to trade school when i was just a grub. the whole system just...makes me feel...insignificant.}
<C>__{motivational counsellor}
<P>__{(enthusiastic)}
<D>__{terrific! you should feel insignificant!}
<A>__{for the first time, we see the ant motivational counsellor. he's a mixture of tony robbins and ron popiel (the hyperactive late night tv huckster, and founder of "ronco").}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{...i should?}
<C>__{motivational counsellor}
<P>__{(hopping around enthusiastically)}
<D>__{yes!!! you know, people ask me, "doctor, why are you always happy?" and i tell them it's mind over matter. i don't mind that i don'tmatter! do you get it? do you get it?}
<A>__{z gives a fake smile.}
<C>__{motivational counsellor}
<P>__{(incredibly "up")}
<D>__{z, we're part of the fastest growingspecies in the whole world!}
<A>__{the counsellor rolls down a chart from the wall. an arrow shows ant population going up, up, up.}
<C>__{motivational counsellor}
<D>__{ask me why we're so successful.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{why are we so successful?}
<C>__{motivational counsellor}
<D>__{i'm glad you asked me that question!}
<A>__{the motivational counsellor opens some blinds...and we see a vista of the ant filled chamber below.}
<C>__{motivational counsellor}
<D>__{what do you see out there?}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{...ants...}
<C>__{motivational counsellor}
<D>__{right! ants! millions of creatures, each with his assigned task, all pulling together!}
<A>__{down below, we see a group of ants carrying a boulder up an incline. one worker ants slips, and the boulder rolls down, crushing his leg. the other ants rush over it looks like they're going to help their fallen comrade, but instead, they climb right over him, and pick up the boulder, continuing with their task.}
<C>__{motivational counsellor}
<D>__{you see? being an ant is being able to say, "hey i'm meaningless,you're meaningless."}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{but but i've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love.}
<A>__{the motivational counsellor puts his arm on z's shoulder...he seems to understand...}
<C>__{motivational counsellor}
<D>__{z...you need help.}
<P>__{(looking at a clock)}
<D>__{whoops! we're gonna have to stop there. your minute is up!}
<A>__{the counsellor ushers z out of his seat and towards the door.}
<C>__{motivational counsellor}
<D>__{now back to work! we've made realprogress! remember let's be best superorganism we can be!}
<L>__{interior early mega tunnel day}
<A>__{a gigantic tunnel, with the size and scale of the "chunnel". a banner strung overhead reads: "the mega tunnel tunneling our way to a bright future!" along the walls hang 50's work incentive style posters with messages like, "you asked for it, you got it more work!" and "two meals a week is enough!!!" line after line of ants is working on the tunnel, digging, passing clumps of dirt from ant to ant, everyone synchronized. close on a clump of dirt being passed from hand to hand.}
<B>__{pull out to reveal}
<A>__{azteca, a feisty, cynical, female worker ant, who stands there, waiting to pass the dirt on. z is daydreaming behind her, with clumps of dirt starting to pile up in front of him.}
<C>__{azteca}
<D>__{hello?! earth to z! you better snap out of it, or there's gonna be a lot of pissed off ants!}
<A>__{z looks back, and sees the ants behind staring at him angrily.}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(snapping out of it)}
<D>__{sorry azteca. here you go, fellas! fresh dirt! alley oop!}
<P>__{(looking at the dirt)}
<D>__{shouldn't we be wearing gloves? i mean this dirt is very...dirty. doesn't anyone think of hygiene?}
<P>__{(z's stomach growls)}
<D>__{boy am i hungry. i'm so hungry i'm seeing double. it looks like there'stwo million ants in here. when's lunch? tomorrow, or the day after?}
<C>__{azteca}
<P>__{(sweetly)}
<D>__{z, old pal...}
<P>__{(shouts)}
<D>__{shut up!!! it's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{the squeaky wheel gets the oil.}
<C>__{azteca}
<D>__{no, z. the squeaky wheel gets thrownaway, alright? you're a good ant, z, even though you are a pain in my rear segment. i don't wanna see anything happen to you. so quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.}
<B>__{a whistle blows.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{thank goodness. breaktime.}
<A>__{all the ants put down their tools. a beat. then the whistle blows again. all the ants pick up their tools again.}
<C>__{azteca}
<P>__{(resigned)}
<D>__{break's over.}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(getting back to work)}
<D>__{this colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground. why are we even digging this thing?}
<C>__{azteca}
<D>__{who cares, z. all i know is, we gotta dig. we're not the ones in charge.}
<L>__{interior town center day}
<A>__{the huge, spacious main chamber of the colony. looming over the scene is the royal palace, which seems to be inaccessible, perched on top of a hill like pedestal. around the base of the pedestal, a crew of workers loiters, seemingly aimlessly...can these be the only unemployed ants in the place?}
<C>__{general formica}
<D>__{stairs!}
<A>__{the workers look up and groan. then they start forming a stairway with their own bodies, linking arms, stepping on each other's shoulders. it's extremely unpleasant work. one ant is a little tardy, and just manages to get in place before... general formica, the pattonesque military leader of the colony, steps on his head, using it as the first step as he ascends to the palace, his aide de camp carpenter in tow. as formica mounts the "stairs" we can hear the workers going, "ouch! oof! yikes!" etc.}
<C>__{general formica}
<D>__{cut the chit chat down there!}
<P>__{(turning to carpenter)}
<D>__{we've spoiled these workers, carpenter. they've never had it so good, and listen to them always grumbling and complaining...}
<A>__{formica steps on the foot of one of the "stairway" ants, who muffles a yelp.}
<C>__{carpenter}
<D>__{...yes, sir.}
<C>__{general formica}
<D>__{what have they got to complain about? three square meals a day...}
<C>__{carpenter}
<D>__{actually, sir, we've cut them down to three roughly rectangular meals a week.}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{don't give me statistics, carpenter. i know what i'm talking about. doors!}
<A>__{formica and carpenter have reached the top of the staircase. there, the two guard ants on either side of the massive throne room doors pull them open and one door hinge}
<B>__{squeaks.}
<C>__{formica}
<P>__{(to guard ant, while passing)}
<D>__{oil that, soldier.}
<L>__{interior throne room day}
<A>__{the queen is on her throne, her huge abdomen sprawled behind her.}
<C>__{queen}
<D>__{ah! general formica.}
<A>__{formica salutes and marches to her, carpenter behind him. note: throughout this scene, the queen is giving birth repeatedly. each birth is accompanied by a herald playing a short "happy birthday" fanfare on his trumpet. mid wife ants bring each baby to the queen for inspection, who coos a few words. the midwives put the babies on a moving bassinet line, powered by ants on a treadmill.}
<C>__{queen}
<D>__{general, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...pains me. the thought of any of my children going hungry...}
<P>__{(she shudders; then, to baby)}
<D>__{who's the cutest widdle worker? you are! yes, you! don't forget to brush your teeth!}
<P>__{(to mid wife)}
<D>__{ship 'er out.}
<P>__{(back to formica)}
<D>__{what steps are you taking to remedy the situation?}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{we are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...}
<C>__{queen}
<D>__{yes, what else?}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{please don't worry, your majesty. leave the worrying to me. as you know, i'm not an ant of half measures. i don't pussyfoot around. this crisis is my number one priority, and i promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively.}
<A>__{the queen's attention is interrupted by another baby being put in her arms.}
<C>__{queen}
<P>__{(to baby)}
<D>__{no snacking between meals! off you go!}
<P>__{(to formica)}
<D>__{now what were we saying?}
<C>__{formica}
<P>__{(oliver north style)}
<D>__{i do not recollect, your majesty. will that be all?}
<C>__{queen}
<D>__{yes, general formica. carry on, my good man! i don't know what we would do without you.}
<A>__{formica clicks his heels and bows his head. carpenter bows low. formica smartly about faces }
<C>__{bala }
<D>__{general formica!}
<A>__{princess bala hurries through a second doorway, carrying a swatch book. something about her sets her apart from the handmaiden ants with her. her tiara, probably. formica tilts his head quizzically to carpenter behind him.}
<C>__{carpenter}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{princess bala, sir. your fiancee.}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{princess! you look outstanding. is there anything i can do for you?}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{well i thought since we're getting married...it might be nice if we...got to know one another.}
<A>__{formica looks confused.}
<C>__{queen}
<D>__{bala has always been a hopeless romantic, general.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{it's just that well, i'm honored that you selected me, and everything, i just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if we had a conversation?}
<C>__{formica}
<P>__{(uncomfortable)}
<D>__{conversation...yes...well...}
<P>__{(to carpenter)}
<D>__{wasn't she briefed?}
<C>__{queen}
<P>__{(holding up a baby)}
<D>__{look, general! a darling baby soldier!}
<P>__{(emotionally, to baby)}
<D>__{don't try to be a hero! just make sure you come back in one piece!}
<P>__{(handing it off)}
<D>__{next!}
<C>__{formica}
<P>__{(using the interruption)}
<D>__{i will take your suggestion under advisement, princess. in the meanwhile }
<A>__{formica turns to go.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{general we have to talk sometime!}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{very well. carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis a vis: relationship?}
<C>__{carpenter}
<D>__{actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule. we have thirty six seconds available right now.}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{outstanding. princess...?}
<A>__{bala's a little fazed...but grabs her chance.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{so, um...how was your day? what did you do?}
<C>__{formica}
<P>__{(scouring his mind)}
<D>__{well...}
<P>__{(that's it!)}
<D>__{i declared war!}
<C>__{bala}
<P>__{(sadly)}
<D>__{oh...and i was afraid we had nothing in common...}
<C>__{carpenter}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{fourteen fifty hours, sir.}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{duty calls!}
<A>__{he strides across the floor. bala watches him go, her antennae drooping unhappily.}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{no squeak. outstanding!}
<A>__{we see through the now open doors into the throne room as formica and carpenter double time out of the frame. the queen sees that bala is unhappy.}
<C>__{queen}
<P>__{(sympathetically)}
<D>__{i felt the same way before i got married. confused. scared.}
<C>__{bala}
<P>__{(hopefully)}
<D>__{you did?}
<C>__{queen}
<D>__{yes but i did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings. the wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged. even marriage. you're lucky general formica is a paragon of anthood.}
<C>__{bala}
<P>__{(unconvinced)}
<D>__{yes...he's wonderful...}
<A>__{the doors swing shut on them revealing the two guard ants who were crushed in the wake of formica's exit.}
<L>__{interior bala's quarters day}
<A>__{bala enters, followed by her handmaidens, who are in a state of giggling infatuation over formica. bala is scowling as she leafs through a wedding catalogue.}
<D>__{handmaiden #1}
<P>__{(swooning over general formica)}
<D>__{the general's body segments are so...symmetrical. handmaiden #2}
<P>__{(giggling)}
<D>__{i'd let him order me into battle anyday.}
<A>__{bala hurls the swatch book against the wall.}
<D>__{handmaiden #1 princess? what's wrong?}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{wrong? how could anything be wrong? i'm going to marry general formica and be a queen and have millions of babies, just like my mom.}
<P>__{(concerned)}
<D>__{do i look fat to you? handmaiden #2}
<P>__{(knowingly, to handmaiden #2)}
<D>__{pre wedding jitters. handmaiden #1 you just need to blow off some steam. let's go to the bar at the royal club!}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{the club's so stuffy. i want to try someplace different. handmaiden #2 there isn't anyplace else }
<P>__{(making a joke)}
<D>__{except the worker bar.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{the worker bar! yes! that's where i want to go!}
<A>__{the handmaidens look shocked.}
<D>__{handmaiden #1 but we can't there'll beworkers there.}
<L>__{interior ant bar night}
<A>__{a long bar filled with ants. the bar itself seems to stretch for miles, and there are hundreds of ants trying to get a drink...unfortunately, there's only one bartender. z is at the bar with weaver, a burly ant soldier.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{we declared war again?}
<P>__{(off weaver's nod)}
<D>__{are you scared?}
<C>__{weaver}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{i will be back.}
<A>__{the bartender, a grizzled veteran, slaps down what looks like a couple of large green beer mugs. actually, they're aphids, little green critters he fills up from a number of kegs hanging from the ceiling. the kegs are specialized ants with hugely distended stomachs, which spray liquid into the aphids.}
<C>__{aphids}
<P>__{(as they're slapped on bar)}
<D>__{ouch! ouch!}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{two aphid beers.}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(as bartender leaves)}
<D>__{did you see that? how he gave you the beers, not me? i'm telling you, he's got something against workers.}
<C>__{weaver}
<D>__{i don't know what you're talking about, z.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{come on everybody dumps on us workers. you soldiers get all the glory. plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.}
<C>__{weaver}
<D>__{yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.}
<A>__{we can see that weaver is eyeing a nearby table of "worker babes", including z's friend azteca.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{weaver, they're career girls. they're obsessed with digging.}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{no, i will probably never meet the girl for me.}
<C>__{weaver}
<D>__{who said there was a girl for you? i was talking about a girl for me.}
<P>__{(quaffing his aphid beer)}
<D>__{don't you want your aphid beer?}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{i can't help it. i have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature. call me crazy.}
<C>__{weaver}
<D>__{z, we've known each other a long time, right?}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{of course. you were born two seconds after me.}
<C>__{weaver}
<D>__{and all the time i've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. you should quit making waves. go with the flow.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{weaver, i'm an insect, not a liquid.}
<A>__{down the bar, there's a commotion. a grizzled old scout ant has had too much to drink.}
<C>__{drunk scout}
<D>__{have you been to insectopia? haveyou? no, ya goddam larvas! but i have...}
<P>__{(becoming emotional)}
<D>__{...mosquitos n' caterpillars n' beetles all livin' in peace, stuffin their guts with food...no rules, no regulations...you can be your own ant there...}
<P>__{(howling drunkenly)}

<C>__{z}
<D>__{hey, weaver, listen!}
<C>__{drunk scout}
<D>__{i was cut off from my unit found it by mistake }
<P>__{(slurring)}
<D>__{it changed my life!}
<P>__{(spraying another soldier with saliva)}
<D>__{you see ya follow the great yellow egg, and you come to the land of red and white }
<C>__{soldiers}
<D>__{you've had enough for one night! come on, gramps, before you get in trouble.}
<A>__{the soldiers pull him from the bar, carrying him out.}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{hey, did you hear what he said?!}
<C>__{weaver}
<D>__{poor guy's had one too many scouting missions.}
<B>__{music starts up.}
<L>__{interior ant bar entrance night}
<A>__{princess bala is peering in at the entrance to the ant bar, accompanied by her worried looking handmaidens.}
<D>__{handmaiden #2 we shouldn't be doing this it isn't proper!}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{i'm the princess, aren't i? handmaiden #2 of course }
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{and do princesses do improper things? handmaiden #2 of course not }
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{then if i go to the worker bar, it isn't improper. anyway, don't worry. no one will recognize us in our disguises.}
<A>__{she adjusts her "disguise", a hardhat, tied down jackie o. style with an ant's version of a chanel scarf.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{i'm just a common worker, cooling off after a rough day!}
<A>__{music starts. an ant barker takes the mic at one end of the dance floor.}
<C>__{barker}
<P>__{(on loudspeaker)}
<D>__{okay, folks. it's six fifteen, and that means it's time to dance.}
<A>__{every ant gets up to dance. weaver turns to z.}

<P>__{(draining his beer)}
<D>__{time to cut a rug, z!}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{i'm not in the mood.}

<D>__{even when they're off work, they follow orders.}
<C>__{weaver}
<D>__{well, you just sit here and be a party pooper.}
<A>__{weaver joins the rest of the ants who are lining up for the dance. the barker calls out the steps in a bored monotone all the ants already know the steps. everyone dances in perfect synch.}

<P>__{(southern twang)}
<D>__{and a left right quarterstep back step halfstep a left right quarterstep backstep halfstep a left right quarterstep backstep halfstep }
<A>__{at the entrance, bala smiles mischievously at her handmaidens.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{i'm going to ask one of these mindless, primitive worker types to dance with me! handmaiden #1 but general formica would be furious!}
<C>__{bala}
<P>__{(enjoying the idea)}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{the handmaidens are appalled. bala whirls away from them, sets her sights and searches the crowd zeroing in on z, who's watching the other ants dance.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{what a bunch of losers. mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system }
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{wanna dance?}
<A>__{bala's standing right there. z is instantly smitten.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{me?! yes!!! i mean }
<P>__{(regaining suavosity)}
<D>__{just let me finish my beer.}
<A>__{not breaking eye contact with bala, z smiles suavely. reaches suavely for a beer. suavely grabs the candle in a glass jar off the bar. suavely singes his face. he plays it off with a rakish little laugh. a bit apprehensive, bala heads onto the floor. z follows her.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{so uh how come i haven't seen you around here before?}
<C>__{bala}
<P>__{(covering up)}
<D>__{i work in the palace, i don't get out much.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{the palace, hunh? i bet those royals really live it up. of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding }
<C>__{bala}
<P>__{(shocked)what?}
<A>__{z and bala step onto the dance floor with the rest of the ants, but z can't do any of the steps.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{now, let's see, i it's been a while since i i think you }
<A>__{bala watches z, trying to follow along. it's the blind leading the blind, as z tries in vain to follow the barker's rapid instructions.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{here, i will lead.}
<A>__{z starts doing his own, individual dance. with a suave expression on his face, he leads bala in a helter skelter mixture of tango, charleston, and hand jive.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{are you sure this is a real dance?}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{well, actually, uh i'm sort of making it up }
<C>__{bala}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{why should everyone dance the same way? it's as exciting as watching fungus grow.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{you're right!}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{you you think i'm right?}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{why can't i just do whatever i want to do? why can't i just go wild?! yahoo!}
<A>__{bala starts to get into it, making up her own steps in reply to z's, loosening up, having fun. for a moment, the two of them are actually sexy together. then they get a little too wild and the other ants, who are still doing their intricate dance, start to collide with bala and z. z almost knocks over a big soldier ant. we can only see the ant's back at the moment.}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{hey! watch your step, worker.}
<A>__{z has turned around to see the soldier ant, major mandible, glaring at him. mandible is about twice z's size. he's got one eye missing, and half of his left antenna his been chewed off.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{you watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up!}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(terrified)}
<D>__{oh, that's okay, i will let him off this time.}
<P>__{(whispering to bala)}
<D>__{are you crazy? this guy's built like a pebble!}
<P>__{(ineptly trying to placate the soldier)}
<D>__{you know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays }
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{aren't you gonna stand up for yourself?}
<A>__{z's caught between a rock and a hard place. he doesn't want to get beaten up, but on the other hand, he doesn't want to lose face in front of bala. more soldiers have gathered around, looking hostile.}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{how come you don't dance like the rest of us?}
<A>__{z glances over at bala. then, shaking with nervousness, he says defiantly...}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{because because i'm an individual! soldier #2 an individual? never heard of it.}
<C>__{mandible}
<D>__{you look like a worker to me.}
<C>__{weaver}
<D>__{hey, lay off my little buddy!}
<A>__{z, meanwhile, looks far away, ecstatic, as if he's just realized something very important. unfortunately, just at this moment, a soldier pushes weaver...weaver pushes him back...somebody makes a dive for z and before you know it, there's a regular bar brawl going on, with weaver in the middle of it, cracking heads together, punching ants in the face, having a great time. just then, the princess' handmaidens hurries over.}
<D>__{handmaiden #1 princess bala! princess bala!}
<A>__{z, who's scrabbling around on the floor, overhears.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{princess? you're a princess? handmaiden #2 the police are coming!}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{uh oh.}
<P>__{(to z)}
<D>__{goodbye! gotta run!}

<D>__{wait! when can i see you again?}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{let me think. hmmnn...}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{never. bye!}
<A>__{bala rushes off with her handmaiden, just before a squad of whistle blowing police wade into the crowd.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{wait! princess! wait!}
<A>__{but she's already gone, leaving z holding her scarf.}
<T>__{cut to:}

<A>__{more laughter.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{you're the hero of the recent termite campaign, aren't you?}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{well, if single handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero, yes i am.}

<D>__{oh...oh well then, one more won't matter.}
<A>__{she moves towards the dance floor. z spit combs his antennae, struts after her until he trips on his sword. he tumbles, falls, but hops to his feet just as bala turns toward him, turning it into a ballet plies.}

<A>__{she frowns...there's something familiar about this guy. but then they start dancing. across the room: the queen and general formica watch the party.}

<C>__{formica}
<D>__{they should be...}

<L>__{exterior ant mound day}
<A>__{hold on: the garbage chute exit. nothing happens for a moment. then from a distance, we hear the faint sound of screaming, dopplering closer and then z and bala come flying out of the exit, right into the mud, cutting off the scream abruptly. bala sits up, coated in mud. z is nowhere to be seen. because she's on top of him.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{this is thoroughly unacceptable!}

<A>__{but...just as bala'a about to be rescued...what looks like a gigantic laser beam sweeps along the rim of the colony, sizzling the ground as it moves along...and ignites the lead soldier into flames! bala looks stunned. z watches in horror as another soldier ant is fried, and we look up to see a gigantic magnifying glass casting the beam...we can just about make out the huge, grotesque figure (a seven year old kid) holding it. bala, who has no idea what's really going on, turns from the colony and runs the other way.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{i'm going! i'm going'}
<A>__{...unfortunately, this draws the fire of the laser, which follows after her in what looks like a strafing run, sizzling in her footsteps. z, who's running towards the princess, suddenly realizes that he's running towards certain doom...and joins bala in legging it away from the colony; under a brown leaf, which burstsinto flames...between the redwood like stalks of some flowers...and finally into the relative safety of some grass...where they throw themselves on the ground, exhausted.}

<C>__{bala}
<D>__{climb up that tree and get a better view!}

<C>__{z}
<D>__{theoretically, yes. but is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{of course! it defines society! to deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!}

<D>__{that's not a name! that's just a letter!}
<A>__{z, meanwhile, hits the road. bala has no idea of where to go. just then, the scariness of the outside world comes through to her. we start hearing noises the equivalent of scary jungle sounds in a tarzan movie the hissing, croaking, chirruping... bala sees eyes looking out at her from all directions...and spots a colossal monster (a sparrow) fixing her with his beady gaze.}

<L>__{exterior lake day}
<A>__{a lake (a puddle) stretches before them. it is, in fact, the overflow of a drinking fountain whose drain is jammed...as z and bala run to the lake, water dribbles from the fountain and into one edge of the pool (to the ants, it's a waterfall). bala and z run to the edge of the water and start slurping. they smile at each other, until they remember that they don't like each other.}

<A>__{ but before he can finish, a water droplet from the fountain falls on him. it may not sound like much, but to z it's as though a ten foot diameter sphere of jello had engulfed him. z's stuck inside because of the surface tension of the droplet, which doesn't burst, just quivers up and down. inside, z is slowly, frantically drowning and screaming for help. but his screams are muffled in the water.}

<C>__{bala}
<D>__{let me go!!!}
<A>__{but it's too late they're now both stuck in the droplet, and, as z continues to drown, he also has to deal with balayelling at him though we can't hear exactly what it. is she's yelling through the water. then, having run out of air, she too starts thrashing, alternately trying to swim and trying to slap him as z tries to defend himself. finally all this commotion is enough to make the droplet burst, spilling the two coughing, sputtering, drenched ants onto the ground. they both lie there, miserable, wet, and cold.}
