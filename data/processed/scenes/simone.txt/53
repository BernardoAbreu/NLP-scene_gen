<L>__{interior viktor's malibu house night}
<A>__{viktor's head hits the sofa in his living room, closely followed by faith on top of him. faith tears at his clothes and her own, ravenous. viktor hardly resists. in the midst of the wild caresses, faith murmurs in his ear.}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{do whatever you do to simone.}
<A>__{viktor freezes.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{what?... what did you say?}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{do what you do to simone.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{what i do to simone?}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{yes, call me simone.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{simone?}
<C>__{faith}
<P>__{(still tearing at his clothes)}
<D>__{yes, yes, again, again. do what you do to simone. i want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{you're with me to be close to her?}
<C>__{faith}
<P>__{(panting)}
<D>__{is that a problem?}
<A>__{as viktor ponders the question, faith begins to do simone's deathbed speech from "sunrise, sunset".}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{"why are we here? is that what you're asking, jack?... why are we here? no why. just here".}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(this is too much for viktor)}
<D>__{please put your clothes on}
<A>__{viktor gets up from the sofa, leaving the frustrated faith to straighten her clothes.}
