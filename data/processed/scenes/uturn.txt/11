<L>__{exterior superior main street day}
<A>__{bobby hits town, such as it is: the freeway left here a few years back. there are only a few little stores: a general store, a catalog outlet, a post office that doubles as a bus depot. all of them built for the desert heat. the busiest spot in town seems to be the truckstop diner with a few 18 wheelers parked outside it. at the corner of one street sits an old blind man dressed in raggedy clothes, perhaps an indian. his seeing eye dog lies next to him. he's talking to two old men, veterans perhaps, indian or spanish. they both have missing limbs and slide off with furtive alcoholic looks as bobby passes. the blind man yells out in an american indian accent.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{hey! you there!}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you want something, old man?}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{don't call me old man. ain't you got no respect, boy?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you want something?}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{yeah i want something. i want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you can't do that yourself?}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{hell no, i can't do that myself. i'm blind. can't you see that?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i didn't }
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{what'd you think i was doing out here with these glasses on? sunnin' myself?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i don't know. i thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{i ain't got no eyes. you want to see?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{christ no!}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{lost my eyes in vyee et nam. lost them fighting the commies. fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i said i was sorry.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{don't be sorry. just run over there and get me my pop before i die of thirst.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{yeah, sure. you got change?}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{change? you want my change? i fought the war and lost my eyes just so i could give you my change?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{all right, old man. christ.}
<A>__{bobby walks across the street to a very old soda machine; it has bottles instead of cans. the blind man shouts to bobby.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{get me a dr. peppa! i don't want no colas. colas ain't nothing but flavored water.}
<A>__{bobby puts change in the machine and pulls out a bottle of dr. pepper. he starts back to the blind man.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{don't forget to open it for me. i can't be opening my own bottle.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{christ!}
<A>__{bobby goes back to the machine and opens the bottle, then walks back to the old man who pours a splash on the ground.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{a little for mother earth. i'm about fifty percent indian, you know. to all our relations.}
<A>__{he takes a hearty swig of the soda.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{ah! just what i needed! want some?}
<A>__{the blind man holds the bottle out to bobby. a string of saliva runs from his lips to the bottle's neck.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i will pass.}
<A>__{bobby reaches down and pets the old man's dog. flies buzz around both the dog and the blind man.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i think you'd better give your pooch a sip. he looks sick.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{that's 'cause he's dead.}
<A>__{bobby jumps back.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{oh, jesus.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{i hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{he's only just dead. what was i supposed to do with him? i can't take him away anywhere. and nobody wants to take him for me. do you?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{hell no!}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{see. ain't nothing i can do but keep him here beside me. that's where he belongs anyways. me and jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and jesse we been pals since the war when i lost my eyes. he was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...i miss him.}
<P>__{(as bobby moves away) i will see ya later,}
<D>__{unless i come across something worse.}
<A>__{bobby noticing a beautiful woman down the street, grace mckenna, compulsively turns and catches up to her. she is dressed better than the usual t shirts and tank tops of this town perhaps a mail ordered dress or a mother's hand me down. with her raven hair and caramel skin, it is obvious she is native american. her arms are full with an awkward package she can barely manage.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{can i give you a hand, beautiful?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i'm just going to my car?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{that's right on my way.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{my mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{my name is bobby. now i'm not a stranger anymore. see how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{do you have to call me that?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i don't know your real name.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{maybe i don't want you to.}
<A>__{grace stops walking.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{maybe, but if you didn't i think you would have kept on walking.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i like that about me, beautiful.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{it's grace.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{may i carry your package, grace?}
<A>__{grace hesitates, then gives the package to bobby. he has trouble with it himself.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{jesus.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you sure you can manage?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i got it.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{do you want me to carry your pack for you?}
<A>__{bobby blurts out emphatically.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{he catches himself, and softens a bit.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{no, i've got it.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{what happened to your hand?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{accident.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you should be more careful.}
<A>__{they start walking towards grace's car.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{it's very nice of you to help me. that package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{no trouble at all, really.}
<A>__{they get to a car and bobby puts down the package.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{wasn't nothing.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{oh, this isn't my car. it's down a ways. i should have parked closer. i just didn't think it would be so heavy. i could drive up.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{that's all right. i got it.}
<A>__{bobby takes up the package and they begin walking again. the package seems to have gained weight.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{it's just new drapes and curtain rods. if i had known it was going to be so heavy i would have had them delivered up to the house.}
<A>__{bobby struggles with the package. sweat starts to sheet his face.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{that a fact?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i just got tired of looking at the old drapes. my mother made them. had them long as i can remember. you ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{yes, i have.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{'course they cost a little more than i should really be spending. but, damn it, i don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself. i deserve nice things.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{i ... can't ... argue ...}
<A>__{they arrive at a jeep sahara.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{this is it.}
<A>__{bobby practically drops the package. he is covered with sweat.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{thank you, bobby.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you're welcome, grace.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you're not from around here, are you?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{why you say that? just because i help a lady with her package?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i just drove in this morning.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{drove into superior? what for?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{didn't have a choice. my car overheated up the road.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you're lucky you didn't break down in the desert. day like today, you'd be dead in no time. when you leaving?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{not until my car's fixed. i don't know how long that's going to take.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{and here i've made you all hot and sweaty.}
<A>__{grace steps to bobby and places her hand against his chest. she rubs away some of the sweat. they look at each other a beat. a police car, seen earlier, pulls up beside them from behind and idles. sheriff virgil potter is a weathered, handsome, middle aged man with suspicious eyes, black haired in contrast to bobby's sandiness.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{morning grace.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{morning sheriff. got my drapes.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{well it's about time. looks like you found yourself a helper too.}
<A>__{bobby wants to shrink behind the drapes.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{well, he offered, and i just couldn't refuse. his car overheated.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{oh?}
<A>__{bobby turns to the sheriff and forces a smile.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{morning, officer.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{son.}
<P>__{(beat, to grace)}
<D>__{little excitement out at the reservation this morning. wayne and dale elkhart were up drinking all night and then wayne starts chasing dale around the desert with his shotgun. bia handled it. i went by for backup.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{anybody hurt?}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{hell, no. that wayne can't shoot when he's sober, much less drunk. he's lucky he didn't kill his own danged self.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{well, anyhow, you stay cool. nice meeting you, son.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{same here, officer.}
<A>__{the sheriff drives on. pause. they look at each other.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{well, i guess i could use some help getting this box into the house. not far. you could shower, get something cool to drink.}
<A>__{bobby considers the offer, but there's not much considering to do.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{well, i could use something cool.}
