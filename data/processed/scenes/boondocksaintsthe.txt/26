<A>__{connor pauses then bursts out laughing. doc calls everyone to gather round.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i got some bad news. looks like i'm gonna have ta close d down the bar. the russians have been buying up buildings all over town, including this one... fuck!... ass! and they're not letting me renew my lease. i got 'til the end of the week to come up with 26,000 dollars, or they take the place. i left them a note telling them not to show their faces t tonight. they been pressuring me ta close and take the last few days ta get all my shit outta here but it's my right to stay open ta the last.}
<A>__{long pause as everyone absorbs. they are upset.}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{let me talk to my boss, may i can...}
<A>__{he is cut off by everyone who obviously opposes mafia involvement.}
<C>__{doc}

<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{y'know doc, i gotta get you a, a, like a proverb book or something. this mix and match shit's gotta go.}

<A>__{everyone chuckles.}
<C>__{connor}
<P>__{(imitating doc)}
<D>__{a p penny saved is worth two in the bush.}
<C>__{murphy}
<P>__{(imitating doc)}
<D>__{don't c cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.}
<A>__{everyone laughs heartily. just then, three large russians in suits enter. the obvious leader, checkov, stands in front with vladdy behind one of checkov's shoulders, with another guy behind the other shoulder. they mean business. the laughter fades.}
<C>__{checkov}
<P>__{(thick russian accent)}
<D>__{i am ivan checkov. you will be closing now.}
<C>__{murphy}
<P>__{(after a long pause)}
<D>__{this is mccoy... we find spock and we got enough for an away team.}
<A>__{everyone laughs. ivan is angry.}
<C>__{checkov}
<D>__{oh, how extraordinary. a bunch of irishmen... and they are being drunken idiots. you are killing the stereotype. i'm in no mood for discussion.}
<P>__{(points to doc)}
<D>__{you! you stay. the rest of you go now.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{why don't you make like a tree and get the fuck outta here!}
<A>__{the locals roll their eyes at doc's blunder.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{calm down, doc. i'm sure they're reasonable fellows.}
<A>__{he and murphy each grab a guinness and a shot of hennessey and they approach the russians with the peace offering.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{listen fellas, y'know he's got 'til this week's end. ya don't have ta be hard asses, do ya?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{yeah, it's st. patty's day. everyone's irish tonight. now, why don't ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us?}
<C>__{checkov}
<D>__{you insult me. i would never drink that sewage. especially with you people. you are fools.}
<A>__{checkov slaps the beer to the floor.}
<C>__{checkov}
<D>__{this is no game! if you won't go, we will make you go!}
<A>__{the boys look at each other, remembering what mom said. they still hold the shots.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{if ya want a fight, you can see you're outnumbered. we're trying ta be civil here, so i suggest you take our offer.}
<C>__{checkov}
<D>__{i make the offers, ass hole.}
<A>__{rocco pushes off the bar. he's had enough.}
<C>__{rocco}
<P>__{(standing between the two brothers)}
<D>__{hey, there boris. what would you say if i told you that your pinko, commie mother sucked so much dick...}
<A>__{wham! ivan punches him in the face. he is quickly down and out. connor and murphy's faces turn to stone as they speak the next few lines in flawless fluent russian with english subtitles.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{"now, that wasn't too polite, was it?"}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{"i'm afraid we can't let that one go, ivan."}
<A>__{checkov is completely taken aback. all the irish are fairly impressed as well.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{i don't think ma would mind.}
<A>__{they clink the glasses together, throw back the hennessey, ball up the thick glasses in their fists, drop to one knee and both deliver a devastating blow to each of checkov's quads. murphy on the left, connor on the right. he's down for the count, writhing on the floor. the boy's each take a russian guy and start fighting as the others start kicking and spitting on checkov. this is a bar brawl, lots of punches don't connect. connor dismantles his man quickly. murphy is still fighting as all the irish try to jump in and help murphy but connor goes into psycho mode, pushing them all back.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{let the boy go. he knows what the fuck he's doing!}
<A>__{they all back off and start to cheer him on. murphy and vladdy are ripping each other apart. vladdy backs him against a wall and pulls back, exhausted, for one good punch. murphy reaches up behind his head with both hands and pulls two bottles of wine from a wall rack. he swings them toward each other with vladdy's head as the mid pointerior the bottles haphazardly connect, one on each side of his head. he crumples to the ground in an explosion of glass and wine. there is shock and silence.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{nicely done, boy!}
