<L>__{154. mizzen topgallant mast}
<A>__{warley works frantically. he's out on the yardarm high above the raging sea. he shouts for hollom to join him, but hollom is still in the top, some twenty feet below, unable or unwilling to climb any higher.}
<L>__{155. the surprise day}
<A>__{wide to see the ship. warley working on the swaying mizzen. the bow swinging a couple of points further south.}
<L>__{156. quarterdeck day}
<A>__{wood and rope straining as they wrestle to turn. then a tremendous crack as the mizzen topmast splits and flies backward into the sea, carrying warley along with it.}
<C>__{bonden}
<D>__{man overboard!}
<A>__{sail and cordage falling over the men at the wheel. a loose block and tackle swinging murderously in the gale. jack fights free from the tangle of ropes as warley vanishes in the foam. the mizzenmast is acting as a sea anchor dragging the ship's head northwards toward the black rocks. jack grabs a speaking trumpet as warley briefly reappears.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{swim for the wreckage, man!}
<A>__{then to pullings.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{reduce sail!}
<A>__{as crewmen scramble frantically into the rigging, jack turns back to see warley desperately swimming toward the trailing wreckage, his mates shouting encouragement over the howling wind. with sails reduced the ship perceptibly slows, but the dragging wreckage is swinging the ship broadside on to the waves.}
<C>__{bonden}
<D>__{she's broaching!}
<A>__{pullings runs to jack, pointing to the trailing mass of ropes and mast.}
<C>__{pullings}
<D>__{it's acting as a sea anchor! we must cut it loose, sir!}
<A>__{warley still struggling to reach the wreckage but going under with each wave. jack, agonized, makes his decision.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{axes!}
<A>__{awkward davies scrambles up the ladder with an axe, but loses his footing and falls sprawling over the quarterdeck. jack grabs the axe and attacks the ropes. he's joined by nagel who has run to assist before realizing that the man overboard is his friend warley.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{set to then. set to!!}
<A>__{nagel's face is a mask of horror, but he obeys jacks orders and starts chopping. he and jack work shoulder to shoulder, matching blow for blow the prow keeps turning, wave after wave coming at right angles to the ship.}
