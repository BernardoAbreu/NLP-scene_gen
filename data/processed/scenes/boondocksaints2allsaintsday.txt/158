<A>__{poppa m listens, far off scratchy music. he moves quietly through the house, stopping at the foot of the stairs...listens. he removes his rosary, hangs it on the banister and moves on, pulling a weapon.}
<L>__{interior greenhouse same time}
<A>__{the roman, swirls a tomato in a plate of salt and bites into it. beside him, a horned phonograph plays 40's jazz. behind him, we see that the greenhouse is merely an extension of the home. the roman sits in front of a sunken fire pit at a low flame. across the pit, an empty chair. extended before him is a stunning garden, standing in stark contrast to the common house: vines, flowers, cobblestone walks, fountains. the center piece is a turkish pool with pure white lillys afloat. poppa m slowly approaches the roman from behind. he holsters his weapon and sits. the roman halts the phonograph.}
