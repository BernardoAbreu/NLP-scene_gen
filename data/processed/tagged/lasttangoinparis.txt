<A>__{paul (50's) stands on the street under a raised train bridge. he covers his ears in utter disgust at the unbearable noise a train makes as it roars overhead. he bellows to the heavens.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(english)}
<D>__{fucking god!!!!}
<A>__{as the train moves on he walks, slowly, despondent. lost in a private world of pain. behind him we see a woman in a fur collard coat and flowered hat walking, gaining on him. this is jeanne (20's). as she passes paul, she turns to glance at him. we read a hint of empathy on her face. he is oblivious to her or anything else for that matter. she walks on, dodging street sweepers as she covers the long walkway, trying to forget the sad man she saw. we see her walk toward a 6 story apartment building. paul, with tears streaming down his face, comes to reality as he also notices the building. he regards it.}

<A>__{jeanne goes to the telephone washroom. the telephone booth is occupied. as she waits, she watches in disgust as an old lady cleans her dentures with a toothbrush and then puts them back in her mouth. jeanne studies her own face in the mirror, puffing her cheeks up in judgement. as she does, paul exits the phone booth, still lost in anguish. after watching him leave, jeanne uses the pay phone. she speaks to her mom.}
