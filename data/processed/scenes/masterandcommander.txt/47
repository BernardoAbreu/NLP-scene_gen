<A>__{his question coincides with a third full broadside from the frenchman. the surprise's wheel shattered. bonden thrown aside, mr. watt jerked back to the taffrail, the mizzenmast hit. a rope sheers and joe plaice is smacked on the skull by a swinging boom. midshipman blakeney, running up on deck, goes to help plaice and is struck down by a flying splinter a shocking wound to his upper right arm.}
