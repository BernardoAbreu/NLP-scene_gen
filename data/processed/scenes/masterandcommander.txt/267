<L>__{261. quarterdeck day}
<A>__{another well placed shot from the acheron smashes through the rigging, sending down a shower of rope and cordage. jack is back at his station by the wheel, the acheron little more than a half a mile astern, the figure of the captain in his black coat clearly visible. jack studies the looming black vessel, then turns and crosses to bonden at the helm. bonden nods, lifting his hands from the wheel as jack grips the curved timber decisively, taking the strain. he feels the pulse of the ship through his fingers, looks up to the sails then back to the acheron. stephen appears beside him, casually smoking a cigar. he offers one to jack, who declines another shot pierces the mizzen foresail above them, but neither man flinches. killick appears with two cups of coffee, and in his belt a brace of pistols.}
