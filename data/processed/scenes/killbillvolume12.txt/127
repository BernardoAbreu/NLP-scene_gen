<D>__{did he teach you that?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{no. he teaches no one the ten point palm exploding heart technique. but he is nietzsche's psalm personified. if pai mei doesn't kill you, he will make you stronger. now one of the things i always liked about you, kiddo, is you appear wise beyond your years. then allow me to impart, a word to the wise. whatever what ever pai mei says, obey. if you flash him even for an instant a defiant eye, he'll pluck it out. and if you throw any american sass his way, he will snap your back and your neck like they were twigs, and that will be the story of you.}
