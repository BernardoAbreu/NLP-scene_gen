<L>__{exterior winnebago day}
<A>__{romeo and simms under the awning. a spiffy new car parked nearby. david simms, 38, looking every bit like the successful tour pro he is... payne stewart to tin cup's maynard g. krebs.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{romeo! it's been awhile. is tin cup around?}
<A>__{romeo is evasive.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{he's on business in houston... you supposed to be out playin' on the golf tour.}
<C>__{simms}
<P>__{(unfazed)}
<D>__{well, you tell him i'm in town for my big charity best ball tournament, and i got a spot for him when he comes back from... whatever.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{you got a spot for tin cup? i thought you hated him.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{romeo! you wound me. i'm fond of the guy, going way back to our days at university of houston, when we won all those titles together.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{he says he carried you on his back.}
<A>__{simms won't be drawn into this adolescent competition he's too comfortable with himself and his success.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{i didn't have much craft back then just a little native ability. roy's a great ball striker....}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{why you here?}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{i want to win my own tournament, and he can help me if we can manage to behave like grownups together. tell him that.}
<A>__{tin cup suddenly appears in the doorway.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{what's the catch?}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{there is no catch. i put together a tournament with an elite field and a half million dollar purse, and i'm tired of seeing all the money head out of town.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{then make more birdies.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{i need you on my team.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{you ain't that friendly a guy...}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{we're playing cottonwood where you once shot fifty nine, where you can shoot sixty five in your sleep 'cuz you know every bump on every fairway, every subtle break on every green }
<C>__{tin cup}
<P>__{(warily)}
<D>__{you an' me }
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{me an' you like the old days.}
<A>__{tin cup can't quite believe this offer from his old nemesis but there aren't many options out there. he grabs simms's hand and starts pumping it, gushing with enthusiasm.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{... well, put 'er there, partner! these two homeboys are gonna show the world what golf in west texas is all about!}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{no, roy. i didn't mean i want you to play with me. i just want you to caddie for me, read my putts, club me, that kinda stuff.}
<A>__{tin cup wilts like a time lapsing daisy. his hand falls free of simms's. words fail him.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{you son of a bitch.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<P>__{(to himself, blankly)}
<D>__{caddie? me?}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{i can't bring a guy in off the street to play in my tournament. it's a big time event, corporate sponsors, thirty dollar tickets... i got a network to cover }
<C>__{romeo}
<P>__{(interrupting, outraged)}
<D>__{this guy off the street, he could kick your ass on that golf course. like he kicked your ass in junior golf. like he kicked your ass in college. like }
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{i will pay you a hundred for the loop, five percent of any earnings }
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{get the hell outta here! take your goddamn color coordinated corporate sponsored soul and get outta here.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{okay, okay, just thought i'd offer you some work...}
<A>__{simms heads to his car.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{simms!}
<C>__{simms}
<P>__{(stops)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{i will take the job.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{we'll take the job.}
<A>__{simms nods in agreement, and exits. tin cup stands there with romeo, feeling humiliated. pov shot simms drives away down the road.}
<C>__{tin cup }
<D>__{that man stands for everything i hate in life.}
<C>__{romeo }
<D>__{you mean like... success?}
