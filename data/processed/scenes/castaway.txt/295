<L>__{interior house day}
<A>__{ladders. scaffolds. huge paintings are everywhere. paintings of wings and angels like the package. chuck stares at them. bettina watches chuck stare.}
<C>__{bettina}
<D>__{i've got some coffee on. would you like some?}
<L>__{interior kitchen later}
<A>__{bettina pours some coffee. the package sits in the counter. some magazines are spread around, including a people magazine with chuck's photograph on the cover.}
<C>__{chuck}
<P>__{(takes a sip)}
<D>__{it's good.}
<A>__{they smile awkwardly at each other. she starts to open it.}
<C>__{bettina}
<D>__{hmmm. feels like it might have gotten wet.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{possible. so you did those wings?}
<C>__{bettina}
<D>__{yeah. a long time ago.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{they're harder to do than they look.}
<C>__{bettina}
<D>__{oh? you've tried?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{well, i do a little drawing }
<A>__{she's opened the package. she pulls out the bottles of salsa and the letter.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.}
<C>__{bettina}
<D>__{he was a sorry sonofabitch, and i'm sorry i ever married him.}
<A>__{there is a moment where neither knows what to say.}
<C>__{bettina}
<D>__{you look familiar.}
<A>__{her eyes start to register recognition. she glances at the magazine with chuck's picture on it. she picks it up.}
<C>__{bettina}
<D>__{i can't believe this. i i they are... you're a gifted artist. you're into something very powerful. primal. truly.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{well, not really, i }
<C>__{bettina}
<D>__{you are. yes you are.}
<P>__{(so many things she wants to say)}
<D>__{what gave you the idea to paint on that cave?}
<A>__{chuck thinks about that. after a moment, he grins.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{to tell you the truth you did.}
<C>__{bettina}
<D>__{do you...have any more packages to deliver?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{no. that was the last one.}
<C>__{bettina}
<D>__{just sit here, i will get us some lunch.}
<A>__{chuck sits back on the couch, taking in the sight of the ocean in the light rain. he looks over at all the canvases, the easel, the palettes. the wind rustles the palm trees around the house. the surf crashes and rustles. familiar sounds. island sounds. he relaxes a little. maybe the package with the wings was a sign, he kept it all these years precisely for this. then there's a sound of a truck in the driveway. the engine cuts off. there are steps on the porch. the door opens. a tanned muscular man in neatly kept work clothes comes in, hangs a tool belt on a hook by the door. he looks at chuck with a relaxed, even stare, as if seeing a man in a fedex uniform sitting on his couch is not an unusual occurrence.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{bettina }
<D>__{in here!}
<A>__{the man nods at chuck, goes into the kitchen. we are on chuck's face. who's this? we hear muffled laughter from inside.}
