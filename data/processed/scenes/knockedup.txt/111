<A>__{ben curls up on the bed with his shirt and boxers on. a scene from "cheaper by the dozen" plays on the television. steve martin juggles all of his children.}

<D>__{this isn't funny. that guy has twelve kids. it's not funny. this is sick. this is a sick movie. that's a lot of responsibility to be joking about. that's not funny. i got to turn this off. it's freaking me out.}
<A>__{pete moves several chairs into the bedroom.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{there are five different types of chairs in this hotel room.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{holy fuck. what are they all doing in here?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{these are five different types of chair.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{get them out of here, man. this is too many chairs for one room.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{there's a guy that works for this hotel. his whole job is to find chairs.}
<A>__{pete moves to a tall chair.}
<C>__{pete }
<D>__{look at this one. look at it. it's gold and red and it's kind of shiny. shiny thread? unbelievable. it is beautiful, and it feels amazing.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{the tall one's gawking at me and the short one's being very droll. i don't like them.}
<A>__{pete switches to another chair.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{oh, wow!}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{it's weird that chairs even exist when you're not sitting on them.}
<A>__{pete switched to another tall chair.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i'm up high! i'm really high up.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i should've read the baby books.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{why didn't you read the baby books? knocked up 105.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{because then it's real, you know?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{dude, it's real whether or not you read those books. that baby's coming.}
<A>__{pete sits on another chair.}
<C>__{pete }
<D>__{oh, man!}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{think they'll take us back?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{yes. but i don't know why. do you ever wonder how somebody could even like you?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{all the time, man. like every day. i wonder how you like me.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{how can debbie like me? she likes me. i mean, she loves me. the biggest problem in our marriage is that she wants me around. she loves me so much that she wants me around all the time. that's our biggest problem. and i can't even accept that? uh, like that upsets me?!}
<A>__{ben sits up from the bed.}
<C>__{ben}

<C>__{pete}
<D>__{she's the one. she loves me.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you can't believe...that people love you? i love you, man! debbie loves you!}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i don't think i can accept her love. there's something wrong with me.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you can't accept love?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i don't know what it is.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{love? the most beautiful, shiny, warmy thing in the world? you can't accept it?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i have to go to this other chair. knocked up 106.}
<A>__{pete switches to a new chair.}
<C>__{pete }
<D>__{oh, this is a better energy.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you can't accept pure love? you can't accept debbie? she's chosen to give you her life. she's picked you as her life partner! but you play fantasy baseball because you can't accept her love?}
<A>__{ben burps.}
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{ugh. i could accept it, man. and debbie's amazing, man. she's cool and she's funny and she smells good and she's nice and her hair always looks different. she's too good for you, man.}
<A>__{pete shoves his hand in his mouth.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{tastes like a rainbow.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you're disgusting. you're an urchin. and she busts your balls because you're a little bitch! you're a filthy bitch! and i'd bust your balls! debbie wants to give her life to you and alison doesn't want to do that with me. and it makes me sad all day. i want to go home.}
