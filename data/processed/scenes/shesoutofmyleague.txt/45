<L>__{interior kirk's apartment bedroom night}
<A>__{kirk lies in bed staring at the ceiling fan. the smile continues as he drifts off to sleep. time lapses as kirk sleeps and the sun comes up. still smiling, his eyes open like a shot and he reaches for his phone "no missed calls."}
<T>__{montage over music:}
<L>__{1) kirk gets up and goes into the bathroom. he checks his}
<A>__{gut and hairline in the mirror.}
<L>__{2) from under his bed, he pulls out a total gym still in the}
<A>__{box. it is dusty, unopened and has a ribbon still attached along with a card that reads, "happy graduation love mom and dad." he sits in the living room bewildered as he reads the directions. the parts are spread out all over the floor. he works out on the machine but it soon violently collapses underneath him. he checks his phone. "no missed calls."}
