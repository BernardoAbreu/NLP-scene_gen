<L>__{exterior full shot the harbor day}
<A>__{one enemy speedboat chases indy between the two freighters. but the speedboat containing kazim veers off and goes around.}
<L>__{exterior between the two freighters day}
<A>__{it's a race for daylight as the two freighters drift ever closer to one another. indy's speedboat just manages to squeeze through the gap. but the enemy speedboat explodes as it is crushed between the two freighters, flying into the air and splashing back down into the water.}
<B>__{indy and elsa}
<A>__{spin their boat around in a sharp half circle to see kazim's speedboat appear racing toward them. he stands in the moving boat, firing a machine gun at indy and elsa. kazim's speedboat matches indy's move for move. full shot the harbor the two boats race across the water nearly side by side. a chattering machine gun from kazim's boat splinters the wood of indy's boat, until finally the rear of the boat catches on fire. the machine gun runs out of ammunition. kazim puts it down and takes control of the wheel from one of the turkish agents in the boat with him. as indy's boat drifts toward the giant, turning propellers at the stern of another steamer, kazim's boat draws up alongside and hits them. indy steps into kazim's boat. he knocks one of the turkish agents to the deck, then turns his attention to kazim. the two men trade punches as the boat spins helplessly in the churning water.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{no!!}
<A>__{indy kicks kazim in the face, knocking him into the water, then pulls him back into the boat, now being sucked through the churning water toward the steamer's giant propeller blades.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{why are you trying to kill us?}
<C>__{kazim}
<D>__{because you're looking for the holy grail.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{my father was looking for the holy grail. did you kill him too?}
<C>__{kazim}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{where is he? talkor you're dead. damn it, tell me! tell me!}
<C>__{kazim}
<D>__{if you don't let go, doctor jones, we'll both die.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{then we'll die.}
<C>__{kazim}
<D>__{my soul is prepared. how's yours?}
<A>__{by now half the boat has been chopped up into matchwood and the blades are getting closer.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{this is your last chance.}
<C>__{kazim}
<D>__{no, doctor jones. it's yours!}
<A>__{the wind of the blades is on their necks. indy grabs kazim just in time and jumps... into the motorboat, driven by elsa, which gets alongside in the nick of time.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{all right! where's my father}
<C>__{kazim}
<D>__{if you let me go, i will tell you where he is.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{kazim}
<D>__{my name is kazim.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{and why were you trying to kill me?}
<C>__{kazim}
<D>__{the secret of the grail has been safe for a thousand years. and for all that time the brotherhood of the cruciform sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.}
<A>__{kazim pulls back his shirt to reveal a birthmark... or is it a tattoo? whatever it is, it's a cruciform sword; a christian cross which tapers down, like the blades of a broadsword.}
<C>__{kazim}
<D>__{let me get off at this jetty.}
<A>__{the boat is close to the edge of the canal. indy gives elsa a nod, telling her to bring the boat in. kazim steps ashore.}
<C>__{kazim}
<D>__{ask yourself, why do you seek the cup of christ? is it for his glory, or for yours?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{i didn't come for the cup of christ. i came to find my father.}
<C>__{kazim}
<D>__{in that case, god be with you in your quest. your father is being held in the castle of brunwald on the austrian german border.}
<A>__{kazim walks away.}
