<A>__{as maurice miller and his "man" a big black bulk named himey strut purposefully up the hall. they step into...}

<A>__{where richard ripley sits at one of the tables reading a big coffee table book called "the warm world of tropical fish."}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{dick. my man.}

<C>__{ripley}

<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{whoever. the point is, prices are goin' up, too. better get your little black book out, richard. we got some business to talk about.}
<A>__{ripley sighs, takes out his black book and opens it.}
<C>__{maurice }
<D>__{let's start with the fish. they was two grand, but now they's three.}
<A>__{ripley looks at the two tiny fish in the bag.}
<C>__{maurice }

<C>__{voice}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{they all look to where...}
<B>__{jack foley}
<A>__{sits at the far end of the table, reading a thick manual of some kind. himey gives him a mean stare. foley points to a sign that says "quiet please."}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{sign says "shut the fuck up." or can't you guys read?}
<C>__{maurice}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{there a problem, foley?}

<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{sounds high, doesn't it?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{must be a real soft pillow.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{faux goose down.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{still...}

<C>__{foley}
<D>__{you're smart, ripley, you'll tell this guy to fuck off.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{really? well, i uhhh...}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{first of all, if he kills you, he's not gonna get any more money out of you.}
<A>__{ripley looks at maurice: good pointerior}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{man doesn't have to get killed. he could accidentally fall on something sharp, like a shiv. or my dick.}
<A>__{ripley turns back to foley now: also a good pointerior}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{you stick anything in this guy, snoop, they transfer his ass outta here faster'n you can throw a fight, and you still end up with nothing.}
<A>__{ripley nods, takes this in.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{this doesn't concern you, foley. why don't you go on out to the yard, have yourself a smoke?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i don't smoke.}
<C>__{himey}
<P>__{(slowly rising)}
<D>__{you heard the man. go on outta here.}
<A>__{foley doesn't move, just gives the guy a bored once over.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{himey here's a pro toh jay of mine. he's ranked number thirty two in the federal prison system.}
<C>__{foley}
<P>__{(looking at himey)}
<D>__{thirty two outta what, twenty?}
<A>__{himey bulldozes forward, pulling his massive fist back to clock foley in the head when... ...in one swift motion foley brings his book up in one hand, like he's throwing a pie, and drives the hefty repair manual into himey's face, snapping the big guy's head back, sending his feet flying out from under him so that he hits the floor back first with a loud thud. maurice goes for foley who picks up the chair just as we hear a whistle. they all freeze, look to...}
<B>__{a prisoner at another table}
<A>__{who nods towards the door. we pan over just as a guard appears, takes in the scene as a dazed himey slowly pulls himself up, covers his now bleeding nose.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{what's going on here?}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{oh, you know, reading's funnamental an' shit, we just excited.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{clear outta here.}
<A>__{the guard exits. maurice and foley are still staring at each other.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{excuse me. snoopy? did we settle the fish thing?}
<C>__{maurice}
<P>__{(looks at foley)}
<D>__{yeah. sure. it's all settled.}
<A>__{he pours the water out of the bag and drops the fish into ripley's open hand. maurice then squeezes ripley's hand into a fist, crushing the fish. he taps his fist to ripley's.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{that's how you do it.}
<A>__{maurice gives foley a last look, starts out of the room with himey. ripley looks at the crushed fish in his hand, then at foley.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{thanks for your help.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{any time.}
<A>__{we hear a phone ring and then...}
