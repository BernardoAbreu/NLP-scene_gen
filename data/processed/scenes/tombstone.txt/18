<L>__{int shieffelin hall night}
<A>__{a full house, pandemonium. curly bill, ringo and their cowboy entourage form a block in the center rows while billy brekenridge, behan's bespectacled, slightly effeminate little deputy makes his timid way down the aisle, looking for a seat midst the off fist fight and yelling match.}
<L>__{2 cocky young cowboys, billy grounds and zwing hunt, call out}
<A>__{to him:}
<C>__{hunt}
<D>__{hey, sister boy!}
<C>__{curly bill}
<D>__{shut up, zwing. sit here, billy.}
<A>__{curly bill beckons. happy as a lark, breakenridge takes the seat next to him. up above, the earps sit in a box, the women thrilled:}
<C>__{allie}
<D>__{this is so much fun! we haven't been to a show since years.}
<C>__{mattie}
<D>__{i hope they're good.}
<C>__{stillwell}
<P>__{(shouting from below)}
<D>__{lady, they better be good.}
<A>__{doc enters, kate on his arm. the women exchange uneasy nods.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{kate, you know the earps.}
<A>__{they sit as white enters with mayor john clum and wife.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{wyatt, this is mayor clum and his wife.}
<C>__{clum}
<D>__{your reputation precedes you. i wonder }
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{not a prayer. nice meetin' you.}
<A>__{while the orchestra tunes up and the crowd's excitement rises, white sits next to wyatt, pointing out the different cowboys and giving a thumbnail sketch of each as we pan over them:}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{well everybody's here except the old man. got the blade, billy grounds, zwing hunt, billy claiborne, wes fuller, tom and frank mclaury, billy clanton's the youngest. wild one. then the breeds, hank swilling, pony deal. florentino's mex breed. they all hate mex, but he hates 'em special. johnny barnes, frank stillwell. that's behan's little deputy, billy breakenridge. follows the cowboys around like a puppy. and the big boys: curly bill brocius, he's the old man's rimrod; the one looks like an actor, that's johnny ringo. best gun alive they say. he's kinda different. curly bill's the only one he talks to. i mean they're all rough boys, but ringo... i don't know. i really don't}
<A>__{music. the house lights dim. the audience hushes. a spotlight hits easel at the end of the stage: "professor gillman and his ballet of gravity." out in the audience, barnes groans:}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{professor gilllman? oh hell, i seen him in bisbee. he catches stuff.}
<A>__{the curtain goes up. professor gillman, a 3rd rate juggler in white tie, tailcoat, and black tights steps out and starts tossing indian clubs in the air. the audience starts groaning but the professor's rictus like smile never changes. having seen enough, frank stillwell stands up and shouts:}
<C>__{stillwell}
<D>__{hey profesor! catch this!}
<A>__{stillwell raises his pistol and fires. an indian club explodes in the professor's hand. screams and scattered laughter in the audience. the professor is frozen in utter shock, staring at the bullet graze on his hand and saying out loud:}
<C>__{gillman}
<D>__{they shot me! i don't believe it!}
<A>__{a chord of music and the curtain drops like stone. applause....}
