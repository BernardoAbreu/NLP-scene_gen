<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior observatory ops center (vfx p)}
<A>__{the station is a smoking ruin consoles flickering, lights dim, damage everywhere. only a few minutes have passed since they were attacked. riker, worf, beverly and two security guards materialize. they're all back in uniform, holding phasers and palm beacons. worf has a tricorder and beverly has a medical kit. the room is cramped, there are fallen bulk heads and blown out consoles. the debris makes it difficult to get a clear view of the room.}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{these blast patterns are consistent with type three disruptors.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{well, that narrows it to klingon, breen or romulan.}
<A>__{beverly follows her tricorder readings.}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{i'm picking up life signs... about twenty meters ahead.}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{that rules out klingons.}
<A>__{riker gives him a look.}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{they would not have left anyone alive.}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{over here.}
<A>__{they pick their way carefully through the carnage of the station...and come to the body of a starfleet science officer. he has taken a disruptor blast to the back and there is a nasty looking scorch mark on his uniform. beverly immediately takes some devices out of her medical kit and begins to treat him.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{worf, you're with me. paskall, you and mendez search the upper deck.}
<A>__{the security guards climb a nearby ladder while riker and worf head down a dimly lit corridor. riker stops at two bodies in the hall, checks them over but they're dead. there is a sudden banging from the far corner of the room. worf and riker quickly move to a collapsed bulkhead.}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{under here...}
<A>__{they both grab hold of a large metal plate, pull it aside and begin to dig through the debris. finally, a hand can be seen grasping about from within the pile of rubble. riker and worf work faster. worf grabs the man's hand.}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{it's all right... do not struggle.}
<A>__{worf holds the man's hand as riker shoves away a final console. we reveal the head and torso of doctor soran, one of the survivors from the lakul (and last seen in sickbay aboard the enterprise b). soran has not aged at all over the years but he does have a permanent scar on his face from the earlier wound. he blinks a few times, seems a little dazed.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{i'm commander william riker of the starship enterprise.}
<C>__{soran}
<D>__{soran... doctor tolian soran...}
<A>__{soran puts a hand to his head, still trying to get his bearings.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{who attacked you, doctor?}
<C>__{soran}
<D>__{i'm not sure... it happened so fast...}
<C>__{security officer}
<P>__{(calls out)}
<D>__{commander you'd better take a look at this.}
<A>__{riker and worf move to the ladder as beverly begins to scan soran... new angle upper deck riker and worf move over to the two security guards who are kneeling over a dead body which is obscured from view. one guard turns over the body, revealing a romulan soldier. worf looks at him in disgust.}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{romulan.}
<A>__{riker and worf exchange a look. off their reactions...}
