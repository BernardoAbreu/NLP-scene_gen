<L>__{interior siesta coffee shop dawn}
<A>__{tight shot of coffee beginning to drip into an empty coffee pot. louise and jimmy are sitting in a booth, both on the same side. they are both playing with their wedding rings.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{don't worry darlin'. i will say i never found you. i will say anything you want. we'll find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{damn, jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i'm choking on it.}
<A>__{they sit for a minute.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{honey? ummm... do you want me to come with you?}
<A>__{they look at each other, into each other and jimmy can see that louise is already gone. louise is really touched that he asked her that but she knows it's impossible. she is very kind to him.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{oh... now... it's probably not such a good idea right now. i will... catch up with you later, on down the road.}
<A>__{in her hand she's been holding the ring in the black box. she puts it on the table and slides it back to him. he stops her, suddenly. he covers her hand with his.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{you keep this!}
<A>__{jimmy is trying not to seem upset, so he's completely still. a taxi pulls up outside.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{your taxi's here.}
<A>__{jimmy pulls her to him and kisses her so passionately that employees in the coffee shop look away. a cook fans himself with a spatula. the taxi driver, who can see in, looks at his watch.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{are you happy, louise? i just want you to be happy.}
<A>__{louise looks at her hand and jimmy's hand.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{i'm happy, sweetie. happy as i can be.}
<A>__{jimmy gets up and leaves the coffee shop. louise watches him go. a waitress comes over and fills her coffee cup.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{good thing he left when he did. we thought we were gonna have to put out a fire.}
<A>__{the waitress chuckles and the other waitresses do too. louise waves to jimmy in the back of the cab. the cab driver winks at her. she smiles to herself.}
