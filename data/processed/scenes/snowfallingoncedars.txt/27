<A>__{arthur and ishmael, now 17, strolling main street in the midst of what seems a festive carnival.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{he was, for better or worse, the only god in my life. i guess it's our nature to resent those we know we can never measure up to...}
<A>__{they are passing modest parade floats, booths with food and games. a genial crowd of farmers, fishermen, families, both races heedlessly mingling. a community. arthur unselfconsciously slips his arm over the shoulder of his tall son.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{...which keeps us from accepting the warmth. the way we should.}
<A>__{up ahead, a crowd has gathered at the steps of the courthouse. something's up.}

<D>__{every summer, after harvest, the strawberry festival was dad's favor ite story to cover. good news was his preference. making him an oddity among journalists.}
<A>__{as we approach, we see a ceremony begin at the top of the courthouse steps.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{highlight was crowning the strawberry princess. always a japanese girl, sort of an unwitting virgin sacrifice to the concept of racial harmony.}

<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{senior year. it was hatsue.}
<A>__{and as the applause ripples through the crowd. as the strawberry princess acknowledges her subjects, her eye falls on... ...ishmael. she drops him a wink. and a special wave.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{she winked at me. in public. which was unusual.}
