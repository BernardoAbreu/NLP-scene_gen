<L>__{exterior slopes of amon hen day}
<A>__{frodo is walking beneath the trees...lost in thought. his feet hit the rough edge of an ancient stone slab...his eyes follow an overgrown path towards stone stairs leading to the summit of amon hen...the seeing seat. a crackling sound! frodo freezes....}
<C>__{boromir}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{none of us should wander alone; you least of all. so much depends on you...frodo?}
<A>__{frodo turns slowly...he stares at boromir, tense, cautious.}
<C>__{boromir }
<D>__{i know why you seek solitude. you suffer, i see it day by day. are you sure you do not suffer needlessly?}
<A>__{frodo stands silent for a moment..the murmur of the wind in the trees and the distant roar of the falls of rauros can be heard}
<C>__{boromir }
<D>__{let me help you. there are other ways, frodo..other paths that we might take.}
<C>__{frodo}
<D>__{i know what you would say, and it would seem like wisdom but for the warning of my heart.}
<C>__{boromir}
<D>__{warning? against what?}
<A>__{boromir has started forward towards frodo, he pulls himself up.}
<C>__{boromir }
<D>__{we are all afraid, frodo. but to let that fear drive us to destroy what hope we have...don't you see that is madness?}
<C>__{frodo}
<D>__{there is no other way.}
<C>__{boromir}
<D>__{i ask only for the strength to defend my people.}
<P>__{(angrily drops the wood he has collected)}
<D>__{if you would but lend me the ring...}
<C>__{frodo}
<D>__{no. . .}
<A>__{frodo steps hurriedly away from boromir.}
<C>__{boromir}
<D>__{why do you recoil? i am no thief.}
<C>__{frodo}
<P>__{(wary)}
<D>__{you are not yourself.}
<C>__{boromir}
<D>__{what chance do you think you have? they will find you, they will take the ring and you will beg for death before the end.}
<A>__{frodo turns to leave.}
<C>__{boromir }
<D>__{you fool! it is not yours save by unhappy chance...it might have been mine. it should be mine. give it to me! give me the ring.}
<A>__{boromir leaps on top of frodo, grasping for the ring! frodo has only moments to act. frodo rips the ring from around his neck..and rams it on his finger.}
<C>__{frodo disappears}
<D>__{boromir spins wildly around, yelling into thin air!}
<C>__{boromir}
<D>__{i see your mind...you will take the ring to sauron. you will betray us! you go to your death and the death of us all.}
<C>__{boromir }
<D>__{curse you! curse you and your halflings! boromir stumbles and falls. his body shakes as if in the throes of a fit...slowly he comes to.}
<C>__{boromir }
<P>__{(disoriented)}
<D>__{frodo! frodo! what have i done. please, frodo...}
