<A>__{a multi colored screen after a few introductory credits, we pull back to reveal the source of this kaleidoscopic backdrop: a single, striped tulip, planted in a long row of other tulips. a hand reaches in and pulls the tulip from the ground. we then cut to: a basket of tulips, carried by hand to a truck, where it is loaded with hundreds of other baskets. the door of the truck is shut and we cut to: the door of the truck opening to reveal that the tulips are now boxed and crated. a forklift moves the crates onto a wagon, which is driven by a manned cart across the biggest warehouse on the planet, the bloenen markt (check this steven) in amsterdam, netherlands. the cart and wagons we were following disappear into a maze of synchronized activity. the cart arrives in the auction room, which is constructed like an ampitheater: the buyers sit in a steeply raked semi circle, facing two giant, clock shaped scoreboards that display the bids on the flowers being viewed. the striped tulips fetch a very high price. the carts of striped tulips are delivered to an automated sorting apparatus of enormous size and complexity. they end up on a truck heading for the airport.}
