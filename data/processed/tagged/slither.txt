<L>__{interior high school classroom day}
<A>__{closeup: a slender woman's hand writes on a chalkboard, in teacherly cursive. we pull back to reveal starla grant, a stunningly beautiful southern woman in her twenties, as she finishes writing out, "survival of the fittest" starla glances at the classroom of high school students. she is a demure woman, somewhat awkward in her speaking, but she has the rapt attention of all the boys in the class.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{when darwin said 'fittest,' he didn't necessarily mean the strongest or the most intelligent, or any one trait he merely meant those organisms most well suited to their environment.}
<A>__{the boys in the class look her up and down as she speaks. kylie strutemyer, a pretty student, notices a boy beside her drawing starla, only without her clothes. she hits him. he chuckles.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{we humans think we're more fit, more evolved, because we're smarter. but we're neophytes. we've been around two million years, give or take. the cockroach has been here for 350 million. you tell me who's the more successful species.}
<A>__{a boy raises his hand.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{will.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{how's all this go with how the bible says there ain't no dinosaurs?}
<A>__{some of the kids laugh at the boy. starla pauses, about to answer, when the bell rings.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{we'll tackle that tomorrow... everyone bring your boxing gloves.}
<A>__{the kids start to leave.}
<L>__{exterior main street day}
<A>__{celebratory banners are strung over this street, including one that reads: "deer season starts today!" we're in the center of wheelsy, south carolina, a moderately depressed small town. today's a big day, as hunters from far and near crowd the streets in their massive pickups. men spill in and out of a gun store buying loads of ammunition. old hunters with faces like prunes stand outside angell's tavern getting drunk. a man with few teeth has a dead deer strung out across the back of his truck, skinning the carcass, its innards spilling loose. jack, an older, uptight man in fancy clothes, is driving through town in his big old cadillac. he comes upon a hunter's truck, double parked, jamming up traffic. jack jams on his horn.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{get the fuck out of the way, cocksucker!}
<A>__{jack turns to see a mother and her two children on the sidewalk, listening and staring in shock.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{mornin', mayor.}
<A>__{jack smiles, a bit embarrassed. jack notices a group of hunters on the sidewalk, looking and pointing at something up in the sky. he looks up to see a small meteor plummeting toward earth.}
<L>__{exterior high school day}
<A>__{students file out of the open door for the day. kylie, starla's pretty student, is among them. she and her friend are looking up at the falling meteor.}
<C>__{kylie}
<D>__{prolly go find it later, sell it on ebay.}
<L>__{exterior horse ranch day}
<A>__{a rancher with a cleft palate turns his head to see the meteor, much closer to him. it's rushing down toward the treetops of a nearby forest.}
<L>__{interior grant's office day}
<A>__{a framed wedding photograph of a very young starla and a large man is sitting on a desk. the photo trembles lightly, with the impact of the meteor hitting the earth. grant grant, a large, indelicate man in his mid forties, notices the photos on his desk moving. he looks up from his desk and out his door, where there's a glass workshop. two workers are carrying a large pane of glass, looking relieved they didn't drop it.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{just a tremor, boys.}
<A>__{grant goes back to filling out the tags of file folders with a sharpie.}
<L>__{exterior police station day}
<A>__{four cops bill pardy, the town's young, relaxed, and handsome chief of police, wally, an older, toad like cop, trevor, a younger, somewhat goofy cop, and margaret, a mannish cop are standing stock still in the station parking lot. they chuckle.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{did ya' feel that?!}
<A>__{they enter the station.}
<L>__{interior police station day}
<A>__{the four cops start to remove their holsters and so forth, finished for the day.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{i always get afraid when that happens, 'cause what if the ground cracks open and you fall inside? it's so hot in there you get all burnt to nothin' like that }
<P>__{(snaps)}
<D>__{happened to my uncle barry.}
<A>__{wally and bill laugh at him.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{who told you that story, trevor?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{my aunt.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{your uncle barry left her for a stripper up in winnsboro.}
<A>__{trevor looks shocked, sad. shelby, a slightly dim dispatcher, on his headset at the police operator's unit, swirls toward them, alarmed.}
<C>__{shelby}
<D>__{chief! we got a 'mergency over at the diner!}
<L>__{interior diner later}
<A>__{the four cops move in. there's a commotion. most of the patrons are standing.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{back there, bill!}
<A>__{the waitress nods back through the service window, into the kitchen, where a large doe is hopping around. a dishwasher stands on the counter, yelping with fear.}
<L>__{interior diner kitchen moments later}
<A>__{bill, wally, trevor, margaret, and the waitress enter. the doe skips around.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{she slipped in, was eating trash. we seen it on tv, how they kill ya' }
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{so we thought we best call in.}
<A>__{bill spots the open rear door, and tries to herd the deer toward it.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{come on now, honey, door's this way.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{it's open season. let's shoot her.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{she's just scared, margaret.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{also, bill likes to take a female through the back door any chance he gets.}
<A>__{wally and margaret laugh. trevor snatches a dish towel and rushes the doe, using it like a cape. the scared doe leaps away from him, jumping onto the kitchen counter.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{she ain't a bull, trevor!}
<A>__{the animal kicks off a pot, which hits margaret.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{goddamn bambi rat!}
<A>__{as the doe jumps to the floor, she gets her hoof wrapped in a telephone cord. the cord is plugged into the wall, trapping the doe in place. wally, margaret, and trevor attempt to dive for the cord, but can't avoid the doe's crazy, flying hooves.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{get back.}
<A>__{the other cops step away. bill steps slowly toward the doe, speaking calmly.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{it's okay, sweetheart. nobody's gonna hurt you.}
<A>__{the doe looks at him, settling a bit. his voice seems to be soothing her. bill gets closer.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{that's right. just gonna pull this cord out. it's gonna be all right.}
<A>__{the cops and restaurant folk look on in awe as the doe, breathing heavily, becomes still. bill scoops close past her, and yanks the telephone cord out of the wall. bill smiles. then the doe runs forward, almost knocking bill over, and streaks out the back door. bill, wally, margaret, and trevor move up to the doorway and watch the deer skitter off into the woods beyond, dragging the telephone, tied to her leg.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{hell, she took a phone. now them forest critters are gonna be calling us all hours of the night.}
<A>__{everyone laughs. wally pretends to be on the phone.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{chief of police there? this a squirrel. bring me a bag of peanuts, motherfucker!}
<A>__{everyone laughs some more.}
<L>__{interior glass workshop evening}
<A>__{grant locks his office for the day. his secretary sees him going.}
<C>__{secretary}
<D>__{'night, mr. grant.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{see ya', ashley.}
<A>__{grant walks across the workshop toward the door. he sees a crowd of workers lounging around a glass cutting table, laughing at something. some of them nod at grant, and he nods back. but he's completely outside their circle.}
<L>__{exterior grant house night}
<A>__{a sizable two story suburban home. all the lights are off but one.}
<C>__{grant }
<D>__{so i get home today, phone's ringing. it's hank wilcox.}
<L>__{interior grant dining room night}
<A>__{starla and grant eat dinner in this well decorated room. as grant chatters, starla occasionally smiles politely at him.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{callin' for you. what the hell? i said, 'hank, that's a little bit outta line don't'cha think, a single man callin' someone's wife?' at night, nonetheless.}
<A>__{starla is quiet, almost afraid:}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{he's teaching environmental science, grant. probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{it's just a work thing.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{work thing hell, starla. he just wants to get in your pussy. him and most these other ones around here. that's where their minds is at, them sick fucks.}
<A>__{grant takes a big bite of food, stuffing his mouth.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{i will tell you, sugarplum, you're lucky you got me. you're too damn trusting. without me to protect you, you'd get kilt one of these days.}
<A>__{starla nods.}
<L>__{interior grant master bathroom later}
<A>__{starla stares at herself in the mirror as she brushes her hair. she uses long, slow strokes, as if stalling.}
<C>__{grant }
<D>__{sugarplum, you coming into bed?}
<A>__{starla turns toward the door. she doesn't say anything for a moment.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{just a second.}
<A>__{starla sets her brush down on the counter. she arranges it neatly beside the others. and walks into the bedroom.}
<L>__{interior grant bedroom moments later}
<A>__{grant turns off the tv as starla gets into bed with him. it's almost completely dark in here. grant crawls on top of starla. he kisses her and grabs her in a way not meant to be rough, but is utterly without grace. after doing this for a few moments, starla starts to push him off her.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{grant, no i'm sorry, i'm just i'm not in the mood.}
<A>__{grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{come on, baby, it's }
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i don't just have some switch.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{sure you do.}
<A>__{through starla's nightgown, grant pretends to flick one of her nipples.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{flip.}
<A>__{then the other.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{flip.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{that's disrespectful.}
<A>__{grant, peeved, gets off of her. he sits on the edge of the bed for a moment, in silence. starla looks afraid.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{when are you in the mood, exactly? seems to me that mood's as rare as winnin' the goddamn lotto.}
<A>__{grant grabs his slacks off the valet and starts putting them on.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{i'm just some big clown to you, ain't i?}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{that's not true where are you ?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{out.}
<L>__{interior henenlotter's sports bar later}
<A>__{grant sits at the bar, knocking back a shot of tequila. he's getting drunk. he taps his glass.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{hit me again there, killer.}
<A>__{the barkeep fills his drink.}
<C>__{barkeep}
<D>__{hey, grant, how's it you come to have the same last name as first?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{parents thought it sounded pleasant, i s'pose. joke on me, ain't it?}
<A>__{grant notices a woman with a lot of makeup brenda gutierrez staring at him from across the bar, smoking a cigarette. grant stares at her, trying to figure out who she is. she slides off her stool. she sashays toward him. she props herself on the stool beside him, leans drunkenly in toward him.}
<C>__{brenda}
<D>__{megan halesy' little sister.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{shit. you're kidding me.}
<C>__{brenda}
<D>__{nope. brenda!}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{hell, you were }
<A>__{grant holds his hand only so high.}
<C>__{brenda}
<D>__{i was! and i will tell you somethin', grant grant. i's in love with you.}
<A>__{grant stares at her.}
<C>__{brenda}
<D>__{my sister megan, she's a big fat cow. was then, even more so now. i'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.}
<C>__{brenda}
<D>__{hell, i was game!}
<A>__{she laughs. so does grant. he stares at her, contemplating sinful things. he nods at her wedding ring.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{who's the lucky fella?}
<C>__{brenda}
<D>__{fuck lucky. never marry a damn half mexican.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{already ain't. married a gal named }
<C>__{brenda}
<D>__{starla covington. don't be ignorant. everyone knows that. fucking prom queen.}
<A>__{grant thinks.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{grant finishes his drink, and gets up to go.}
<C>__{brenda}
<D>__{where you goin'?}
<A>__{grant speaks more loudly than need be:}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{starla, she gets real worried 'bout me i stay out too late. loves me too much, that one.}
<A>__{he glances around to see if people have heard, and stumbles out.}
<L>__{exterior shaded creek later}
<A>__{grant sits on a boulder beside a creek, looking miserable, downing a six pack. he throws an empty can into the creek, when he glances down and sees particles flowing down the river. grant slides off the boulder. he kneels and examines the particles. they shimmer in the moonbeams coming down between the trees. grant peers up the creek from where the particles are coming. he sees a gap on the edge of the creek, where water splashes and is diverted in streamlets down the hill. he approaches the spot, and comes upon a small crater on the side of the creek. the meteorite is inside the crater, but it's cracked into pieces. the rock seems almost organic, like a shell. the shimmery specks are part of the shell itself, flecking off into the creek and rushing downstream. grant crouches. he touches the meteorite, and feels some sort of goo inside it. it's sticky. he notices a strip of the same slime leading out of the crater itself and into the woods. grant, curiously, slowly, follows the slimy trail. he comes to a flurry of colorful wild flowers. something is rustling the flowers ever so slightly. he moves in closer. a gelatinous yellow organism slithers sluggishly between the flowers. the organism is a mound a few inches high, gross and veiny, yet as colorful as the flowers around it. a small cavity on the apex of the organism constricts and expands lightly. i guess it's not worth keeping secret that this thing looks a tad like a bright yellow vagina.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{what the...?}
<A>__{grant is a little freaked out by this thing, even frightened. he looks around for someone else.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{hey, anybody 'round here? 'lo?}
<A>__{no one answers. grant looks down at the organism, unsure. he picks up a tree branch. grant softly prods the organism with the pointy end of the branch. nothing happens. he does it again. the thing pulses a little, and surges toward grant. grand pokes it again. a small, thin quill a spore emerges from the cavity in the center of the organism. the spore is quivering and, as it trembles upward, little bulbed spurs pop up as well. grant slowly bends down to look at it when the spore suddenly shoots out. it strikes grant in the stomach.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{ow! fuck!}
<A>__{grant yanks up his shirt, looking at a wound on his abdomen. he watches as the spore quivers and disappears inside him. he clutches his stomach, screams in agony. he falls back into the colorful flowers. his body convulses.}
<T>__{match cut to:}
<A>__{cat scan shot interior grant's body we see the insides of grant's body, as if sliced in half. we zoom in on the little spore, which is jittering up through his body, and into his neck. the spore keys into the base of grant's cerebellum, and his entire brain crackles with a white electrical energy.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{grant freezes in place, his fingers contorted up in front of him, silent. he's utterly still, a wax corpse. a hippie camping couple run into the area, looking for the source of the screams. the man looks down at the frozen grant.}
<C>__{camper}
<D>__{over here!}
<A>__{the camper crouches down beside him.}
<C>__{camper}
<D>__{hey, man. you all right?... dude?... oh shit.}
<A>__{the camper turns from grant to his girlfriend.}
<C>__{camper}
<D>__{i think he's d }
<A>__{grant gasps suddenly, sitting up and grabbing the man, like a drowning man popping up above water. the camper yelps and jumps back. grant sweats and heaves, trying to speak, but hardly can }
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{it's taking... my... brain.}
<C>__{camper}
<D>__{buddy?}
<A>__{grant's eyes glaze over, and he eases off. he heaves there, momentarily confused. his eyes dart around, as if seeing his surroundings for the first time. grant stands.}
<C>__{camper}
<D>__{you all right, man?}
<A>__{grant looks down curiously at the camper. then he turns and stumbles away from them, out of the forest.}
<C>__{camper}
<D>__{that might of been a stroke, buddy. you better take it easy.}
<L>__{interior grant's pickup dawn}
<A>__{grant drives down the road in his luxury pickup truck, sweating and blinking rapidly.}
<L>__{exterior grant house morning}
<A>__{grant steps out of the truck in his driveway, when he hears }
<C>__{neighbor }
<D>__{hey ya', grant.}
<A>__{grant swings his head toward his neighbor, who is taking a happy beagle for a morning walk.}
<C>__{neighbor}
<D>__{what were ya', night fishing again? you catch anything?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{i caught a little somethin', yeah.}
<A>__{grant walks inside his house.}
<L>__{interior grant foyer morning}
<A>__{grant looks around the foyer.}
<L>__{interior grant bedroom morning}
<A>__{grant creeps into the bedroom, looking around. we can hear the shower running. grant spots his face in a mirror above the dresser. he moves in close to the mirror, and stares at his own image. he pulls on his face a little, his eyes brimming with excitement. he smiles at himself. grant looks toward the open bathroom door, where he hears the running shower. he creeps toward it. grant peeks around the doorway. starla is in the shower, soaping herself. she looks beautiful there. grant tilts his head to the side like a dog. he watches her, mesmerized, even moved.}
<L>__{interior grant bathroom moments later}
<A>__{starla is wearing a white towel and brushing her wet hair in the foggy bathroom mirror when she hears air supply's every woman in the world coming from the bedroom. she's struck by it. she moves toward the door. opens it.}
<L>__{interior grant bedroom morning}
<A>__{the shades are drawn, darkening the room. a few candles have been lit. grant is standing there, mostly in silhouette. he's silent, and he doesn't move.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{hey there, sugarplum.}
<A>__{starla looks at him, stirred.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{haven't heard this for a while.}
<A>__{grant walks toward her. he takes her hand in his own, lifting it beside him. he wraps his other arm around her waist. and he slow dances with her. starla dances too, a bit hesitantly, a bit shy.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{i never danced in a towel before.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. i remember it.}
<A>__{starla nods.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{i'm sorry about last night. i get a little insecure sometimes, want to hold on too tight. it's just 'cause you're precious to me, starla.}
<C>__{grant }
<D>__{but i swear to god, baby, i'm turning over a new goddamn leaf. okay?}
<A>__{starla nods, touched. grant's eyes are teary.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{i love you, sugarplum.}
<A>__{starla and grant kiss, tenderly. grant falls to his knees in front of her. he runs his hand over the curve of her hip, her thigh, her buttock, with as much fascination as lust. he pushes starla back onto the bed. he lifts her leg, and kisses it, nibbles on it a little, scrapes his teeth on it. starla is surprised by this, but enjoys it too: it's probably the most foreplay she's had in years. grant crawls on top of her, runs his hands over her breasts, her face. starla's hand moves over grant's back, and to his stomach. when she stops, startled.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{grant, what's that?}
<A>__{she gazes down at the wound between them, on grant's bare abdomen, where the spore entered him. the wound is yellowish, and surrounded by veins. grant, embarrassed, pulls his shirt down.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{just a little bug bite is all.}
<A>__{grant kisses and munches on starla as she lies back on the bed, enjoying it.}
<B>__{o.s. humming.}
<T>__{fade to:}
<L>__{interior teacher's lounge day}
<A>__{starla is humming every woman in the world as she drops coins into a soda machine and chooses tab. janene, a heavyset black teacher, notices this.}
<C>__{janene}
<D>__{what are you so smiley about, girl?}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{oh, nothin'.}
<A>__{starla grabs her soda and sits down with janene. janene just stares.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{just, grant and i had a nice morning. it's been a while.}
<C>__{janene}
<D>__{oh! you got that fresh fucked glow, don't you?}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{janene.}
<C>__{janene}
<D>__{you slut.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{hush.}
<C>__{janene}
<D>__{no shame. you're a married woman.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{he was... considerate. maybe this is the start of a real change in grant.}
<L>__{interior grant bathroom day}
<A>__{grant is holding up his shirt, and looking at his torso. the wound on his side is blackened and gangrenous, and is starting to puff up into a veiny little spout. a fuzzy bluish moss is growing in the crevices around the spout. a pus oozes out. grant looks concerned. he squirts some neosporin onto his fingers. he massages it slowly into the wound.}
<L>__{interior grant kitchen moments later}
<A>__{grant opens the refrigerator door and rummages around inside. he pulls out some bread. some cheese. he opens the meat drawer. it's replete with cold cuts. he pulls out some oscar mayer baloney. turkey. pastrami and salami. he grabs every type of meat there is.}
<B>__{moments later}
<A>__{grant assembles a sandwich at the table. two pieces of bread and some cheese. he starts putting the meat on. but he can't stop, piling more and more on until he has a little sandwich tower. he looks at it. something seems off about it. he removes the cheese. better. and then the bread. even better. he stares at what is now simply a tower of cold cuts.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{meat.}
<A>__{after contemplating it for a moment, grant stands and carries off the pile of meat.}
<L>__{interior grant garage moments later}
<A>__{grant enters the garage through a door from the foyer. he flips the lights on with his shoulder. he looks around. grant spots an old file cabinet. he sets the tower of meat down on the oily floor and opens a drawer. it's filled with files. he closes that drawer, and opens another. it has manila file folders, but no files. grant takes out the folders. he uses a sharpie to write out "baloney" on a folder. then he stuffs all the baloney into the folder and files it away. he starts writing out "pastrami".}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{grant flips through his alphabetically filed meat: from "baloney" through "turkey." but he doesn't look satisfied.}
<L>__{interior supermarket later}
<A>__{grant stands beside the butcher's counter with a shopping cart. he peers dreamily in through the glass at the rows of steaks, pork chops, and so on.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{meat.}
<C>__{butcher}
<D>__{howdy, mr. grant. you goin' to the deer cheer this weekend?}
<A>__{grant snaps out of his reverie.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{sure thing, killer.}
<C>__{butcher}
<D>__{what can i do you for?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.}
<C>__{butcher}
<D>__{how many you need?}
<A>__{grant stares at the steaks.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{well... having us a little dinner party... i'd say... eight. no, no... fourteen...}
<A>__{the butcher nods, starts to grab steaks. grant chuckles.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{hell, what am i holding back for? why don't you just give me everything you got here?}
<C>__{butcher}
<D>__{all the rib eyes?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{yep. and while you're at it, get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and, ooo, what's this here? osso buco?...}
<L>__{exterior grant home later}
<A>__{grant backs his pickup toward the garage. meat is piled into the bed. wrapped packages of meat fill the seats around him.}
<L>__{interior grant garage moments later}
<A>__{grant stands in the garage, tearing open the packing, and letting the loose meat slide into piles onto the floor, muttering:}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{meat.}
<B>__{moments later}
<A>__{grant rolls slabs of beef over the dirty floor and into a pile. something skitters across the garage and around the pile. grant peers around the pile and sees a rat nibbling on some ribs. he realizes something.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{you're meat.}
<A>__{the rat moves away from grant. but grant snaps out his arm with alarming speed, snatching the rat. it squeaks and wriggles in his grip, tearing and biting at him, trying to get free. grant snaps its neck, and tosses the dead rat onto the pile of meat. continues on.}
<L>__{exterior grant garage night}
<A>__{starla pulls into the driveway. she presses the button on her garage door opener. the door shudders but stays closed. starla's confused. she gets out of the car and examines the door. she looks down and sees a new padlock, locking the door to the cement driveway with bolts on both sides.}

<A>__{bill nods.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{grant kills a cow right about here. see there's the blood, musta slit its neck.}
<A>__{margaret walks backward, showing the trail of blood in the crushed grass.}
<C>__{margaret}

<C>__{wally}
<D>__{put that down, numbnuts!}

<C>__{bill}
<D>__{he's gotta be in the forest. all three ranches run alongside it.}

<D>__{bill, i heard what you're doing. i think i should go along.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{why? listen, it doesn't matter. i gotta go.}

<L>__{exterior strutemyer ranch night}
<A>__{darkness has crept over the ranch, and the beautiful, pastoral scene has become distinctly more sinister. the wind blows hard, whistling through the long weeds. a rusty rooster windmill atop the old barn twists and clinks on its half bent perch. a piece of tarp hangs down from the barn roof, flapping incessantly against the wooden wall. trevor and jack; the redneck and the good ol' boy; and margaret and the older cop are hidden around the ranch, waiting, watching or dozing.}
<L>__{interior strutemyer barn night}
<A>__{inside the barn, the wind is only slightly quieter, and it's darker. bill, starla, and wally are here. bill peers out through the doorway at cattle drinking from the trough. he looks at starla; her head tilts to the side as she nods off. when her head falls all the way, she snaps back up, and catches bill gazing at her. bill nods and smiles. she doesn't smile back; she's embarrassed and miserable and this is the last place she wants to be. they sit there for a moment in the dark.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{hey, starla, remember that time when you were a kid and you came knocking on my window in the middle of the night?}
<A>__{wally looks at them.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{starla here's twelve. guess i was fourteen. i said, 'starla, what the hell you doing out there?' she tells me she's running away to hollywood to become a big star. she said she knew i was in rotc, and she was gonna need a bodyguard. invited me along.}
<A>__{wally laughs. bill smiles. starla is embarrassed, but grudgingly enjoys the story.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i said, 'starla, if there's anybody can take care of herself, i think it's you. i'm gonna have to decline.'}
<C>__{wally}

<C>__{bill}
<D>__{yeah, maybe i did.}
<L>__{exterior strutemyer ranch night}
<A>__{jack smokes a cigarette as he keeps an eye out for the cow killer. the burning ember of the cigarette is blown off by the wind. jack searches for it in the dry grass, trying to catch it before it starts a fire. he crawls forward, slapping the ground, when he glances up and sees... a large, shadowy shape hulking through the trees on the edge of the forest.}
<L>__{interior strutemyer barn night}
<A>__{bill, starla, and wally see grant grant emerging from the forest. he has transformed into something much more monstrous: a giant, gangrenous, slug like beast, a clump of cells and tumor like protuberances. he has various tentacle like arms growing out of him, like overgrown eyes on a potato. as opposed to just having the disease, he now seems to be the disease itself.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{grant?}
<L>__{exterior strutemyer ranch night}
<A>__{jack and trevor watch in amazement as grant slithers across the field, his large, dark, watery eyes searching out prey. jack turns to trevor, pissed, and whispers:}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you said 'squid'!}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{it got worse.}
<A>__{the redneck and the good ol' boy watch too, mouths dropped. the diseased grant slithers through the grass just a few feet beside margaret and the older cop. they duck below the grass, looking as if they're going to have heart attacks. grant approaches a cow. the cow makes a little moo of protest when he gets too close, and steps back. the grant creature stabs one of his tentacle growths into the cow's neck, piercing it. the cow stumbles, choking. blood spurts from her neck. and she topples over.}
<L>__{interior strutemyer barn night}
<A>__{bill and wally stare out the window, motionless.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{what we gonna do now, bill? cuffs won't even fit on 'im.}
<A>__{starla musters courage. she stands, and moves out of the barn.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{starla, where you...?}
<L>__{exterior strutemyer ranch night}
<A>__{grant wraps a feeler around the cow's horns, and starts dragging it back in the direction of the forest.}

<A>__{bill motions through the barn window to margaret.}
<L>__{exterior strutemyer ranch night}
<A>__{margaret motions to trevor. trevor motions to the recruits. and starla moves slowly in toward grant.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{grant?}
<A>__{grant turns and looks at her with his half human eyes. his breathing is loud, raspy, and sick. he sees, in a wide circle around him, the nervous posse standing up, their guns at the ready. starla moves even closer. bill and wally are coming in close behind her.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{grant? it's okay.}
<A>__{as starla and the posse get closer, grant looks almost scared. his eyes dart around from cop to cop.}

<D>__{you're just sick is all. but we'll take you to get help right now. i will stay by your side, grant, just like i swore i would. for better or worse. remember?}
<A>__{grant's huge milky eyes betray that he does.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{okay?}
<A>__{the posse inch in closer, tightening the circle. grant lets out a piercing screech of protest. all of the posse stop, terrified. everything is quiet and still except for grant's gross breathing. deep: in, out.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{okay, grant? it's gonna be all right.}
<A>__{grant screeches again: a warning. he looks from starla to bill, with hurt, jealous eyes, and growls. then grant's eyes close to half mast, and he turns away. his tentacle tightens around the cow's horns, and he again drags it toward the forest. while bill tries to decide what to do, the good ol' boy nervously blocks grant's path. he aims his pistol at him.}
<C>__{good ol' boy}
<D>__{you stop right there, you son of a bitch. i don't care what kinda leprosy you got. we need to find that girl. now you can make this peaceful, or you can make it hard.}
<A>__{pause. grant and the good ol' boy stare at each other. and then grant snaps out a tentacle arm, whipping it up the front of the man's body, and back. the front of the good ol' boy's whole body is split neatly in half. for a split second, he remains alive: the two different sides of his split head look down in disbelief as his organs spill out from inside him. and then he topples over.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{fire! fire!}
<A>__{the posse shoot at grant. starla covers her head. grant is struck; he screeches in pain. he lets go of the cow. he slithers with incredible speed off toward the forest. bill and the other posse members take off after him like hounds on the heel of their prey. they shoot madly. starla watches as the posse follows grant into the woods. starla stands alone and worried a moment, and then she darts off after them.}
<L>__{interior kylie's bathroom night}
<A>__{kylie is running a bath. she hears gunshots echo in the distance. she peers out a little window above the tub, trying to see where the shots are coming from.}
<L>__{exterior forest night}
<A>__{the posse run through this very dark forest after grant, leaping over brush and rocks. they're nervous, but also excited, as the primordial hunting urge takes over. their eyes are filled with anger and bloodlust. they're able to follow grant only by catching glimpses a flash of flesh between trees, a tentacle disappearing around brush.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{there he is! over there!}
<A>__{they fire at the creature, taking chunks out of trees, but missing. he's too fast.}
<L>__{exterior creek night}
<A>__{grant slips around a boulder and splashes through a creek, and into the plentiful trees beyond. he rustles thick fronds as he moves up alongside the creek. the posse run up the creek itself, splashing, trying to peer through the leaves to get a shot at grant. jack, carrying his revolver, trips and falls in the creek. he cuts his knee on a sharp rock. he stands, and keeps going. they come to }
<L>__{exterior forest clearing night}
<A>__{the posse come up out of the creek. they've completely lost track of the diseased man beast. they stop, out of breath and looking around. they whisper:}

<D>__{we ain't never gonna find that girl now.}
<A>__{the redneck is weeping with rage.}

<C>__{bill}
<D>__{starla, get the hell out of here!}
<A>__{starla takes a couple steps back, but doesn't leave. she watches there, half in shadows as the posse creep around, searching for some trail of grant. margaret looks down into the bubbling creek. she sees it's turning red. she looks up the trail of red, which is rippling downhill in the water. the red flow starts somewhere near a boulder. bill and wally are searching in front of the boulder. margaret sees, but they don't, grant pulling himself up on a tree branch and rising behind them. blood from a shotgun wound is dripping into the creek. grant, pissed, lifts a tentacle.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{bill!!}
<A>__{bill turns as the tentacle swings down toward him. he falls back; the tentacle slashes inches from his face. bill blasts his shotgun up at grant, but grant is already slithering swiftly back into the thick brush. the posse squeeze themselves though the brush, following.}
<L>__{exterior old barn night}
<A>__{the posse emerge on the other side of the brush, only to be confronted by a terrible odor. they cover their noses and mouths as their faces shrivel in disgust.}

<D>__{what the hell's that smell?}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{it's something dead.}
<A>__{the posse gaze up at the old ramshackle barn where grant had brought brenda.}

<D>__{it's coming from in there, ain't it?}
<A>__{margaret looks at bill.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{think he's inside?}
<A>__{bill takes the lead, carefully approaching the barn. the posse follows, their weapons drawn. the closer they get to the barn, the more unbearable the smell becomes. only bill, intent on the task in front of him, doesn't react to the stench at all. bill leans his ear in close to the front door, and listens. through the door he can hear a quiet sobbing. bill and wally exchange a look. bill steps back. he and wally aim their shotguns at the door. bill nods to margaret, and gestures for her to open it. starla watches all this from the rear. margaret swings open the door.}
<L>__{interior old barn night}
<A>__{bill and wally move cautiously but quickly inside. but they stop suddenly, in disgust and horror.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{oh...}
<A>__{it's brenda. and she doesn't look good. her weepy little head is stuck to the front of a huge fleshy orb, which is what her body has become. this enormous ball of flesh is nine or ten feet tall. vestigial fingers protrude from the sides. she is utterly immobile. her flesh sloshes, slightly and constantly; a thousand snakes seem to be slithering beneath her thin, tight, bruised skin. the woman is in great pain. she sobs. her mouth and chin are stained with blood. the posse and starla enter behind bill and wally and are equally astounded.}
<C>__{older cop}
<D>__{oh, shit!}
<A>__{they see the source of the awful stench: brenda is encircled by the rotting carcasses of cows and horses and forest critters. they are mostly skeletal, as they have been largely devoured. they're swarming with flies. the stench is so bad the posse cover their faces with the bottom of their shirts. the sobbing brenda looks desperately at bill and wally.}
<C>__{brenda}
<D>__{something's wrong with me.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{uh, yeah.}
<A>__{bill and wally get in a little closer.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{brenda, um...}
<C>__{brenda}
<D>__{i didn't want no one to be seeing me like this.}
<A>__{as the posse inch closer, brenda's whole body suddenly lurches forward a bit like whatever's inside her is trying to get out and to the posse. brenda screams in agony. the posse jump back. they stare as she recomposes herself.}
<C>__{brenda}
<D>__{how are my boys, bill? are they all right?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{boys are fine, brenda. uh, what's what's happening here, exactly?}

<C>__{bill}
<D>__{he led us here.}
<A>__{and then brenda's body bursts open completely, like a water balloon hitting cement, and thousands of little slithering eyeless parasites with slippery black red skin like slugs spill forth. the horrid creatures, eight inches long and a few inches thick, swarm over the posse, completely covering them before they can react.}
<L>__{exterior old barn night}

<C>__{starla}
<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{our foursome look up to see a buick century parked at a haphazard angle in the middle of the road. the driver's side door is open. the headlights are still on. they look at each other. bill takes his flashlight off his belt and aims it in front of him. they all slowly approach the car, in the darkness. bill aims his flashlight into the buick. the keys are still there, but no one's inside. trevor looks at the grill of the car. it's dented.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{they musta hit a deer. probably got out to see if it's okay.}

<D>__{fuck me.}
<A>__{the deer springs upward, bringing his hoofs into bill's chest. bill is knocked violently to the gravel, dropping his shotgun and satchel. the deer rears back and brings his hoofs down into bill again. they crack bill's head against the hard road. kylie, trevor, and starla see diseased deer coming in at them from different directions. the deer screech like dying rabbits.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{bambi rats!}
<A>__{trevor aims his pistol at a deer jumping toward him. he shoots, misses. the deer knocks him down. the deer stomps his feet, rearing up and down on trevor's ribs, almost like a little dance. the deer tears at trevor's sleeve with decidedly carnivorous teeth, forcing him into letting go of his gun. kylie screams. she dives into a small space beneath a rock overhang on the side of the road. she watches what's going on from there. starla sees the buick a few yards away. she glances beside her to see the largest diseased deer of all, a horned buck, careening toward her. she dashes toward the buick as fast as she can. a tumorous doe leaps onto bill, biting into his shoulder and tearing at his flesh, so now he has two deer on him. bill is bleeding, dizzy, and disoriented, but he's able to turn, just a bit, to see the barrel of his shotgun above him. he tries to scoot himself back as he's being battered. he reaches up for the shotgun; but the tips of his fingers barely graze the muzzle. starla arrives at the buick, and starts to crawl into the front seat. but the horned buck is upon her. he bites into starla's ankle. she screams. he yanks back on her, half pulling her onto the road. but starla grabs onto the steering wheel with all her might, and pulls against the horned buck's massive power. the deer on trevor starts pulling him off, dragging him down the road as he hollers. kylie, underneath the rock overhang, watches bill try to scoot himself back and reach for the shotgun. it's just a little too far away. she works up her nerve and slowly starts to crawl out toward him. as starla is stretched between the horned buck pulling on her ankle, and her hand on the steering wheel, she's able to flip on her side and turn the keys in the ignition; the engine starts. she reaches one hand down to the floorboard, pressing on the gas. the buick lurches forward, wrenching her away from the horned buck's mouth. bill reaches again for the barrel of his rifle. it's too far away. but then he sees kylie, at the butt of the rifle. she reaches out and pushes it just a little, into bill's hand. bill grips the muzzle like a baseball bat, and swings it into the face of the deer jumping on him, knocking the beast back. the deer tries to stumble forward again, but its whole head and neck have been knocked askew. it topples over, dead. bill flips the shotgun forward into his hands. he stuffs the muzzle into the tumorous doe biting into his leg. the deer looks at him. blood is running down bill's face and he looks half crazed. bill glances down and sees the telephone wire wrapped around her ankle. bill pulls the trigger, destroying her. he stands, looking around for the deer with trevor. it has dragged him a fair distance down the street. bill shoots once, missing it, and again, hitting it straight on. kylie looks around to see more diseased deer running through the fields toward them. starla pulls herself into the driver's seat and backs up alongside her friends. throws open the passenger door.}

<L>__{interior flower store night}
<A>__{the buick and suv are destroyed, amidst the ruins of this store. shattered vases and flowers surround them. glass fragments dangle from the window frame. some fall and clink to the floor. starla lifts her battered head from the wheel. she looks beside her to see bill and trevor, seemingly unconscious. she looks back at kylie. the impact has killed her. her neck is bent at an ungodly angle. bone juts up out of her skin. starla looks out her rear window and sees the suv door open, and the diseased driver stumble out. his body is battered and broken, but, still, he lumbers toward her. he tries to speak, but his jaw is broken, and only a mumbly moan comes out. starla struggles to get out of the car. eventually, she does, and she falls to the floor, amidst the broken glass from the shattered window, and the water all over the floor from the broken vases. she sees the moaning driver limping toward her. he's still trying to speak, but he's unintelligible. the driver gets close, ready to grab her. starla sees a metal bar. she grabs it. and slams it into the diseased man's shin. he topples over. she crawls onto the fallen driver and brings the metal bar down into his head, again and again, shouting and crying with fury. starla looks down at the man, who is very dead. starla looks up to see dozens of diseased townsfolk coming at her, from down the street, between buildings. they see starla there.}

<A>__{bill grabs trevor by the wrist, and tries to pull him away from them. but trevor screams in agony; the liquid has made his flesh too soft. his entire body splits apart like wet tissue, his organs spilling out in front of them. bill stares down in shock, still holding trevor's arm. starla has pulled away enough boards of the other door. she throws it open. none of the diseased are on this side of the building anymore. she moves outside.}
