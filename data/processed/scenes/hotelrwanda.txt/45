<L>__{interior hotel lobby. day}
<A>__{paul turns, walks past porters ferrying the bbc luggage. he puts his hand out. gregoire hands him keys. paul does his rounds. he double checks the banquet room where technicians install several tv monitors and test the signal. he looks in the kitchen, frenzied activity. he wanders behind the bar. everything is 'under control'. he returns to the lobby, greets connie, her flustered husband and their friends, followed by a team of porters and luggage.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{forgive the hurry but i do not want you to miss the lunch buffet on the paddle steamer across the lake. it is the most spectacular sight in all africa.}
<C>__{ob}
<D>__{lunch? all we do is eat. i thought there was famine in africa.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{exactly, we can't have our guests starving. what would they think of the mille collines back in the united states?}
<A>__{gen. bizimungu, takes paul's arm, pulls him aside, hands him his empty briefcase.}
<C>__{general bizimungu}
<D>__{keep that cockroach benedict away from me.}
<A>__{as the general disappears into the bar, paul waves over the coat check, hands her the briefcase.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{same as last time.}
