<A>__{dim lights. janice and frank both don eye guards. frank switches on a low intensity laser on and it's beam shoots across the room. the beam distorts slightly in the center of the room. as frank widens the spectral pattern, suddenly the beam splits into a million different spectral rainbows, momentary illuminating sebastian's entire frame in a glowing tingle of light.}

<A>__{linda pulls vials from the cyclotrons and props blood sample slides. she slips them under the microscope. she takes a sip of her diet coke and puts it on the table. she pears into the microscope and analyses the blood sample, squeezing more stain onto it. she looks up to make notations, but when she reaches for her diet coke it isn't there. she looks around. it's on the other side of her microscope. she shrugs it off, she takes a sip and sets it down where it was before. she peers into the microscope again and when she looks up... the diet coke is gone. she looks around the room and sees it on another table completely.}
