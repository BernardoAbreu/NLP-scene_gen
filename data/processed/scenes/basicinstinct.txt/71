<A>__{it is dark, quiet. pindrop quiet. he is sitting on the side of the bed, his head down... his back a line tracing of dried blood. she is asleep nest to him, naked. he looks around the room. the white scarf around the bedpost... the coke on the side table... clothes all over the floor. he gets up, walks into the bathroom.}

<A>__{the light is too bright. he looks at himself in the mirror. he pours the water, lowers his head, puts cold water on his face. a long beat, he comes back up, opens his eyes. roxy is in the mirror behind him. she startles him. he looks at her in the mirror a long beat, doesn't turn. she is expressionless; she wears the same thing she wore at the club. he lowers down into the basin again, puts more water on his face, comes back up, uses a towel this time, finishes with the towel. she is still looking at him in the mirror the same way. he looks at her in the mirror, doesn't turn.}
