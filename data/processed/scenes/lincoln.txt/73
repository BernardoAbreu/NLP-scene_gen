<D>__{i know the vote is only four days away; i know you're concerned. thank you for your concern over this, and i want you to know: they'll approve it. god will see to it.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{i don't envy him his task. he may wish he'd chosen an instrument for his purpose more wieldy than the house of representatives.}
<C>__{elizabeth keckley}
<D>__{then you'll see to it.}
<A>__{lincoln looks at her, considering. then:}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{are you afraid of what lies ahead? for your people? if we succeed?}
<C>__{elizabeth keckley}
<D>__{white people don't want us here.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{many don't.}
<C>__{elizabeth keckley}
<D>__{what about you?}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{i...i don't know you, mrs. keckley. any of you. you're ...familiar to me, as all people are. unaccommodated, poor, bare, forked creatures such as we all are. you have a right to expect what i expect, and likely our expectations are not incomprehensible to each other. i assume i will get used to you. but what you are to the nation, what'll become of you once slavery's day is done, i don't know.}
<C>__{elizabeth keckley}
<D>__{what my people are to be, i can't say. negroes have been fighting and dying for freedom since the first of us was a slave. i never heard any ask what freedom will bring. freedom's first. as for me: my son died, fighting for the union, wearing the union blue. for freedom he died. i'm his mother. that's what i am to the nation, mr. lincoln. what else must i be?}
