<A>__{mike's audi rolls into the driveway. the door swings open. a muddy, shoeless foot steps out followed by a shoed foot but in no better shape. we follow the feet, tattered slacks dragging on the cement, to the door. 2 filthy hands dig into pockets, searching }

<D>__{i've had a really rough night.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{aaaaahhhhhhhhh!!!!!}
<A>__{ed slams the door, frantically wobbles away. the door opens, angle on the muddy feet as they enter and follow the trail of cotton balls up the stairs and to the bathroom door.}
