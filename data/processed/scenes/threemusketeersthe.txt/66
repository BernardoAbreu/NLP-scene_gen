<A>__{d'artagnan stands at a flowing stream, wipes the tears from his eyes. aramis appears at his side, offers silent comfort, a hand on d'artagnan's shoulder.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{i imagined his death a hundred time.}
<C>__{d'artagnan }
<D>__{on a battlefield, defending his king. fighting bravely for france. and now... i will find the man who murdered my father and kill him where he stands.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{a man is better measured by his life than by his death. your father was bold, and brave.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{but you never knew him...}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{he lives in you.}
<A>__{that's all the evidence aramis requires. d'artagnan pauses to reflect. then wonders:}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{and your father?}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{i was orphaned at a young age. the church took me in.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{you didn't have one.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{but i did. he was a great man, a leader of the church. and his example inspired me to dedicate my life to god's service.}
<A>__{aramis opens his cloak, reveals a priestly cloth. a secret he carries near to his heart.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{you were a priest...}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{i was a fool.}
<P>__{(eyes on the cool water)}
<D>__{this great man, this father, betrayed the church, and turned his back on god. to worship power and gold.}
<C>__{aramis }
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{it broke my heart to see it.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{and you became a musketeer.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{i joined the musketeers and a strange thing happened. i got my faith back.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{but who was that man...}
<C>__{aramis}
<P>__{(turns to face him)}
<D>__{all of france knows him. his eminence, the cardinal richelieu.}
<A>__{d'artagnan nearly jumps from his boots.}
