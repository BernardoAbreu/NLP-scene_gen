<L>__{interior winter's room day}
<A>__{this is a small, dark space, light coming mostly from a rather conventional looking standing lamp. in the shadows beyond the little space of light is a confusion of half open doors, walls and shadows, half lit rooms with un guessable occupants. winter is there, sitting in a padded chair in front of a coffee table, reading a book. amy steps inside. winter doesn't react to her presence. abruptly, the door closes behind her. she hesitates and walks forward.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{amy klein.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{you know me.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{i chose you.}
<A>__{amy pauses, unsure, then moves forward and takes a seat opposite him.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{that was a hell of a way in. makes me think that you don't want...}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{people come in here the way they want. if it was difficult, then that was the way you wanted it. a little danger. a little mystery. that's what you expected. that's what you found.}
<A>__{winters puts the book down. his attention is now on amy.}
<C>__{winter }
<D>__{were you afraid, amy? just now? and during your little "rite of passage" through the walls?}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{yes. was it real?}
<A>__{winter smiles, he displays amusement to amy's suspicions.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{and were you afraid when you saw marla chen? of what you found in the bathroom?}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{you took something from her?}
<A>__{winter studies amy.}
<C>__{winter }
<D>__{do you have it with you?}
<A>__{amy opens her bag and produces the puzzle box. she lays on the table between them.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{my great grandfather created that box. he left it as a...gift. a way to cheat death, an entrance to everlasting pleasures, and it belongs to me. though there are others who would disagree.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{marla warned me about it, about you.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{really? should i be honored or afraid that you are here, amy klein. do you really think you can just go along with us for a little ride and then get off when it suits you? like your new friends on the train? you're not going to find it so easy to get off this train.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{so i shouldn't get on?}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{your already on it. don't dance with me, amy klein. don't think for a second that you aren't in danger. you are in more danger than ever imagined possible.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{what the hell does that mean?}
<A>__{winter leans into amy's space.}
<C>__{inter}
<D>__{listen to me. there are things that are true in the light of day. there are other things that are no less true, that live in the shadows. when you shine a light on them, they disappear. they stop being true. that's because it is the uncertainty of the dark that makes them possible. if the dark is deep enough... anything might be happening in it. anything at all. i'm one of those things.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{what happened to marla chen? what did you do to her?}
<A>__{he stands and walks away from amy.}
<C>__{inter}
<D>__{marla? why, i accepted her, that's all. that's all i've ever done for the people who come to me.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{she didn't want to become one of you, whatever the hell you are. that's why she killed herself.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{oh, but she did. and what makes you so sure she's dead?}
<A>__{winters studies amy face.}
<C>__{inter }
<D>__{we all die, over and over and over again. marla can't commit suicide. all she can do is stop believing that she's alive. and she can't even do that.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{the more she doubts, the deader she becomes. but she'll never really die, because she's not really alive.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{that doesn't mean anything. what i saw in that room was real. what i smelled was real. real like this table.}
<A>__{she raps on the table with her middle finger, palm up. she then lifts her hand up keeping her middle finger towards winter.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{real like, like this hand...}
<A>__{in a flash, almost supernaturally , winter passes seemingly through the chair and is front of amy, her hand held tightly by his. he reaches up with his other hand and uncurls amy's fingers.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{you say this is real?}
<A>__{he begins to move his fingers over her hand, enumerating the various parts.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{epidermis. the dorsal fascia. transverse carpal ligament across here...}
<A>__{the process is taking on an oddly seductive quality.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{the median nerve underneath it. down here, the carpal bones... and do you think that all those parts are what makes a hand? i will show you what makes a hand... here...}
<A>__{he begins to move his fingers through the spaces in between her fingers. amy is frozen still.}
