<A>__{start close on kyle's hand, clutching star's tightly. we hear them singing faintly, together:}
<C>__{kyle and star}
<D>__{twinkle, twinkle, little star...}
<A>__{wider, their heads, feet and chests are clamped onto sliding trays, a long row of these hold other prisoners as well. kyle and star must reach across a gap between the trays to hold hands. (it's the first time we've seen her hatless.) the trays are all poised before panel covered semi circular openings built into the wall, in a sterile, hospital like environment. above each opening is a monitor screen. an ominous hum is building. in an adjacent operating theater, visible through glass walls, medical lasers mounted on robotic arms work on anesthetized patients (we needn't see the grisly details). behind star and kyle, the panels open, the trays slowly slide into the openings. screams and sobs from other prisoners.}
<C>__{star}
<D>__{oh no, oh no...}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{shh, keep singing.}
<A>__{kyle and star hold hands for as long as possible, then release their grip as their bodies enter the chambers and the panels slide shut.}
