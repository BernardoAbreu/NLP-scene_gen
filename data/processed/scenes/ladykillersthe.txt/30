<L>__{interior munson house cellar day}
<A>__{the general stands stock still, his nose an inch away from the earthen wall, studying it, squinting through the smoke of the cigarette pinched between his lips. the rest of the men are opening their cases and taking out the instruments. gawain's case contains, however, not a musical instrument but a boombox and several tapes. he loads one of the tapes into the machine.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{what do you think, general? present any problems?}
<A>__{after a beat the general turns away from the wall to give dorr a look into which one might read anything, or nothing. gawain hits play on the boombox and the cellar is filled with the fussy strains of baroque chamber music. dorr nods.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...good then.}
<A>__{he spreads a map open on the sackbutt case.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...all right, gentlemen, why don't we all crowd around and go over the plan.}
<A>__{the biggest feature on the map is a wavy, roughly north south pair of lines: a river. a boat icon sits at one edge and from it a dotted rectangle extends inland. dorr taps at the boat icon with his fiddle bow.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...this, gentlemen, is the lady luck, gambling den, cash cow, sodom of the mississippi delta and the focus of our little exercise. here is orchard street...}
<A>__{he is tracing a street that parallels the dotted rectangle extending from the boat. the street is lined by small house icons on either side; the bow comes to rest on one of those icons.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...and here is the residence of marva munson, the charming lady whom y'all met moments ago. gentlemen...}
<A>__{bow taps emphasize:}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...you... are... here. now. this brings us to this square...}
<A>__{the bow indicates it, and then withdraws. dorr uses the bow as a swagger stick to punctuate as he begins to pace.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...gentlemen, i believe you are all aware that the solons of the state of mississippi, to wit, its legislature, have decreed that no gaming establishment shall be erected within its borders upon dry land. they may, however, legally float upon any watercourse defining a state boundary. but while the gambling activity itself is restricted to riverboats, no such restriction applies to the functions ancillary to this cash besotted bidnis. the casino's offices, locker rooms, facilities to cook and clean, and most importantly its counting houses the reinforced, secret, and super secure repositories of the lucre may all be situated... wherever. gawain where is wherever?}
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{say wha?}
<A>__{dorr's smug smile fades. testily:}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{where is the money?}
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{oh. end of every shift pit boss brings the cash down to the hold of the ship in the locked cash box; once a day all the cash boxes're moved to the counting room.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{and where is the counting room?}
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{well, uh... in that square there. where you pointing.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{and what, to flog a horse that if not at this point dead is in mortal danger of expirin', does the dotted square represent?}
<A>__{gawain hesitates, the question's obviousness suggesting to him some trick.}
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{...offices. underground.}
<A>__{dorr's eyes close. a smile of feline contentment curls his lips. he murmurs:}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{underground... mmm... during the casino's hours of operation the door to the counting room is fiercely guarded, and the door itself is of redoubtable pittsburgh steel; when the casino is closed the entire underground complex is locked up and the armed guard retreats to the casino's main entrance. there, then, far from the guard, reposes the money, cosseted behind a five inch thick steel portal, yes, but the walls, gentlemen, the walls of that room, are but humble masonry, behind which is only the soft loamy soil deposited over the centuries by ol' man, the meanderin' mississip', as it fanned its way back and forth across this great alluvial plain...}
<A>__{he has pried a fistfull of dirt from the cellar wall.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...this earth.}
<A>__{he crumbles it, letting it sift to the floor, and then, pleased with himself, he smiles.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...any questions?}
<A>__{lump looks around, then hesitantly raises his hand.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...yes, lump?}
<C>__{lump}
<D>__{what, uh... what does "cosseted" mean?}
<A>__{once again dorr's smile fades. he does not dignify the question with answer.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{the general here, whose curriculum vitae compahends massive tunneling experience thoo the soil of his native french indochina, will direct our little ol' tunnelin' operation.}
<A>__{the general acknowledges with a curt nod.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...clark pancake, while a master of none, is a jack of all those trades corollary to our aim. he will be doin' such fabricatin' and demolition work as our little caper shall require.}
<A>__{clark acknowledges verbally:}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{happy to be on board.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{gawain is the proverbial "inside man". he has managed to secure a berth on the custodial staff of the lady luck, thereby placin' himself in a position to perform certain chores whose precise nature needn't detain us here, but whose performance shall guide this expedition to its happy conclusion.}
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{ya damn skippy.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{and this brings us to lump. to look at lump you might wonder, what function could he possibly fill, what specialized expertise could he possibly offer, to our merry little ol' band a miscreants. well gentlemen, in a project of such magnitude and such risks, it is traditional nay, it is imperative to enlist the services of a hooligan, a goon, an ape, a physical brute, who will be our security, our fist, our batterin' ram. lump is our blunt instrument, and on all our behalfs i wish him a warm mississippi welcome.}
<C>__{lump}
<D>__{thanks, professor.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{well gentlemen, here you are, men of different backgrounds and differing talents, men with, in fact only two things in common: one, you all saw fit to answer my little advertisement in the memphis scimitar, and, two, you are all going to be, in consequence, very very incredibly rich. let us revel in our adventure, gentlemen. let us make beautiful music together. and above all, gentlemen, let us keep it to ourselves. what we say in this root cellar, let it stay in this root cellar.}
<C>__{lump}
<D>__{there's no "i" in "team".}
<A>__{all stare at him.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...lump has a very excellent pointerior}
<A>__{the music swells, supported now by a male chorus that has the spirited manliness of the red army choir. we}
