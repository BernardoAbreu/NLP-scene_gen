<L>__{exterior blaine's house day}
<A>__{another nice home in connecticut. sebastian's porsche is parked outside.}
<L>__{interior blaine's house bedroom day}
<A>__{a typical teenagers bedroom, expect this one is a shrine to herb ritts homo erotic art. blaine tuttle, oakwood prep's resident drug dealer and open homosexual, sits at his desk separating pot seeds from his stash. sebastian paces behind him.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{unbelievable. some fag, no offense }
<C>__{blaine}
<D>__{ none taken }
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{ wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.}
<C>__{blaine}
<D>__{any ideas who it could be?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{blaine, if i knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.}
<C>__{blaine}
<D>__{where did you say she's from?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{kansas. who the hell do i know in kansas?}
<C>__{blaine}
<D>__{greg mcconnell.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{the football stud?}
<C>__{blaine}
<D>__{he's from kansas city. i wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{it would make sense. mcconnell hates me. i fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.}
<C>__{blaine}
<D>__{i don't think that bothered him.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{blaine}
<D>__{let's just say greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{are you shitting me?}
<C>__{blaine}
<D>__{i shit you not. mcconnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. we'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. you know }
<P>__{(imitating greg)}
<D>__{"what are you doing, man? i'm not a fag. i will kick your ass if you say anything."}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's like, for christsakes greg, you're gay, deal with it. the only reason why i let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a hoover.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{too bad he's in kansas this summer.}
<C>__{blaine}
<D>__{not anymore. football team started practice last week. he's already called me to hook up.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{really. you think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?}
<C>__{blaine}
<D>__{hmmm. i do believe bravo is showing spartacus on television tonight.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{outstanding.}
<C>__{blaine}
<D>__{don't think it's not going to cost you.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{no problem. just make sure your front door is unlocked. shall we say the "stroke of midnight" no pun intended?}
<A>__{sebastian hands blaine two hundred dollar bills.}
