<L>__{interior hospital room day}
<A>__{from the way matt, sid and the girls are positioned around the room, we can tell their presence there is now way of life. scottie snoozes on the little sofa. we may notice that elizabeth is even more shrunken. a knock is followed by }
<B>__{a vase of flowers}
<A>__{appearing in the doorway, topped by blonde hair and held by thin bronzed arms. it's julie speer.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{julie. what are you doing here?}
<A>__{he rises to help her find a spot to put the flowers. she nods to the girls.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i know we just met, but i was thinking about you guys these past few days, and i knew your mom was here. i don't know. i just felt i should stop by.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you remember alex. this is scottie. sid. this is mrs. speer.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{julie.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{were you friends with my mom?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{no, we never met. but i know a lot about her.}
<A>__{as they now do often, matt and alex exchange a look.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{well, we appreciate your coming by. the flowers are lovely.}
<C>__{sid}
<P>__{(heading to the door)}
<D>__{scottie, alex. let's go to the cafeteria.}
<A>__{the girls follow sid's prompt, leaving matt alone with julie, standing, a dying woman between them.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i, uh, i'm not sure how much you know about my wife's condition, but she's going to die very soon. any minute, really. that's sort of why we're all here.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i know. that's why i came. because i know. i came because my husband wouldn't. and that just didn't seem right. i thought someone from my family should come.}
<A>__{wow.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i'm sorry i came to your house like that. just barged in on you.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{it's all right. i assume you're angry. of course you are. i'm angry too.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{so he told you, huh?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{after you left that night, he was acting really weird. then i started smelling it all over him. i'd already smelled it.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you're a woman.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i finally got it out of him. we've been going crazy ever since. not easy with the kids around. it's all something i never could have imagined. and then your family's decision about the land. i think you're doing the right thing, but brian is well, it's all so complicated and confusing.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{brian told me everything. well, how can i ever know it's everything? when did you find out? have you known for a while?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{just a few days ago.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i'm angry, but i'm just so sorry. i can't imagine what you're going through. do you mind if i say something to her?}
<A>__{matt is unsure but what else can he do? julie approaches the bed.}
<C>__{julie }
<D>__{elizabeth, i'm julie. brian's wife. i just want to say i forgive you. i forgive you for trying to take brian. i forgive you for almost destroying my family. i have to forgive you. even though i want to hate you.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{okay. all right. that's enough, julie. i think... i think that's enough.}
<A>__{matt walks to the door and opens it. alex and sid who've clearly had their ears against the door scamper away, unnoticed by matt and julie.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{he didn't love her. just so you know. he didn't really love her.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{that's why i'm here.}
<A>__{julie heads to the door. at the door, she looks at matt. matt looks at her. she leaves. matt is left alone with his wife, and he realizes suddenly that this is his moment. he walks to the bed, takes her hand, rubs his palm over her hair. he says something to her as though silently praying, then realizes he should say it aloud. he presses his lips to hers and puts his hand on her stomach.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{goodbye, elizabeth. goodbye, my love, my friend, my pain, my joy. goodbye. goodbye. goodbye.}
