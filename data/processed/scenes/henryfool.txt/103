<A>__{moments later. fay is in the shower as... henry bursts into the bathroom, tearing at his belt and trousers. she starts screaming and wraps herself in the shower curtain. he drops his pants and throws himself on the toilet just in time to begin shitting his brains out. fay crouches, terrified and disgusted, in the shower.}
<C>__{fay}
<D>__{jesus, henry!}
<A>__{henry sweats and moans as he empties his bowels in a violent and messy blast of noise and foul air. fay covers her face and whimpers sickly. finally, he's done. he hangs with his face out over his knees, sick, exhausted and in shock. fay wraps herself in a towel and steps out of the shower. she creeps carefully around him and flushes the toilet, growing increasingly concerned.}
<C>__{fay}
<D>__{hey, henry. you ok?}
<A>__{he is destroyed, staring down at... the 'ring' he still holds in his hand. fay sees this, looks at henry, then kneels and takes it from him. he doesn't resist. she lifts it up and breathlessly admires it. totally misunderstanding, moved beyond words...}
<C>__{fay}
<D>__{oh. oh, henry.}
<A>__{and she throws her arms around him as he sits there, sweating and spent, on the toilet.}
