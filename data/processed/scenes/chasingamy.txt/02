<L>__{interior comic book: convention signing booth day}
<A>__{a physically large fan sweaty brow, tote bag bursting with comics leans forward, smiling.}
<C>__{fan}
<D>__{could you sign it to a really big fan!}
<A>__{holden sits at a table. across from the barely managing to stand fan. he offers him a patronizingly kind, half smile in return,}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{you bet.}
<A>__{we're at a comic book show, specifically at a book signing. behind holden hangs a large banner, heralding holden mcneil and banky edwards creators of bluntman and chronic'. beside it is a large mock up of the comic book cover which features two stoner super heroes who bear a striking resemblance to a pair of very familiar friendly neighborhood drug dealers, holden hands the book back to the fan.}
<C>__{fan}
<D>__{i love this book man! this shit's awesome. i wish i was like these guys getting stoned, talking all raw about chicks and fighting supervillains! i love these guys! they're like cheech and chong' meet bill and fed'!}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{i like to chink of them as rosencrantz and guildenstern' meet vladimir and estragon'.}
<C>__{fan}
<D>__{yeah!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{who!}
<A>__{banky signs the book of another collector.}
<C>__{collector}
<D>__{so you draw this!}
<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(signing the comic)}
<D>__{i ink it and i'm also the colorist. the guy next to me draws it. but we both came up with the characters,}
<C>__{collector}
<D>__{what's that mean you ink it'!}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{well. it means that holden draws the pictures in pencil, and then he gives it to me to go over in ink}
<C>__{collector}
<D>__{so you just trace!}
<A>__{banky freezes up. he composes himself and continues signing.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{it's not tracing. i add depth and shading to give the image mere definition. only then does the drawing really take shape.}
<C>__{collector}
<D>__{you go over what he draws with a pen that's tracing.}
<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(hands book back to collector)}
<D>__{not really.}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{next!}
<A>__{a little kid steps up but the collector lingers.}
<C>__{collector}
<D>__{hey man. if somebody draws something and then you draw the same thing right on top of it, not going out side the designated original art what do call that!}
<C>__{little kid}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{i don't know. tracing?}
<C>__{collector}
<P>__{(to banky)}
<D>__{see?}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{it's not tracing.}
<C>__{collector}
<D>__{oh, but it is.}
<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(to little kid)}
<D>__{do you want lour book signed or what?}
<C>__{collector}
<D>__{hey don't get all testy with him just because you have a problem with your station in life.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{i'm secure with what i do.}
<C>__{collector}
<D>__{then say it you're a tracer.}
<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(grabbing little kid's book)}
<D>__{how should i sign this?}
<C>__{little kid}
<P>__{(grabs book back)}
<D>__{i don't want you to sign it, i want the guy that draws bluntman and chronic to sign it. you're just a tracer.}
<C>__{collector}
<D>__{tell him, little shaver.}
<A>__{holden accepts a comic from another fan.}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(off comic)}
<D>__{who do i sign it to!}
<A>__{before holden can finish, a loud crash is heard. he looks to his left and freaks. banky is throttling the collector from across the table. the collector attempts to fight him off. security guards pull them apart. holden grabs banky.}
<C>__{collector}
<D>__{jesus! all i did was call him a tracer!}
<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(to collector)}
<D>__{i will trace a chalk line around your dead fucking body, you fuck?!}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(to security guard)}
<D>__{could you get him out of here!}
<A>__{the security guards drag the collector away.}
<C>__{collector}
<D>__{hey, wait a sec! he jumped me! and you're dragging me away!!}
<P>__{(exiting)}
<D>__{fucking tracer!}
<C>__{banky}
<P>__{(calling oc)}
<D>__{your mother's a tracer!!}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{can i explain the audience principle to you! if you insult and accost them, then we have no audience.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{he started it! fucking cock knocker! he's lucky i didn't put my pen through his thorax!}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{need i remind you...}
<P>__{(holds up watch)}
<D>__{curtain's in ten minutes.}
