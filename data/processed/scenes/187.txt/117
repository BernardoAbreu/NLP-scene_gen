<A>__{(5th period) ellen walks down an aisle of computers as the class settles...}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{... before getting side tracked with viruses and t s r programs, we were talking yesterday about e mail.}
<L>__{intercut s:}
<A>__{tevie. ellen passes stevie's computer as he shares cryptic information with a kid sitting next to him. ellen approaches her computer console on wheels at the front of the class.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{if you click on the mail icon in your tray, you'll be ready to send and receive mail. my computer's already set up. everyone go ahead and click the white envelope in the lower...}
<A>__{ellen's interrupted by her own computer. a little white envelope icon in the lower left hand tray flashes and beeps. now a computer voice announces: "you've got mail." ellen's taken aback. class titters. now she grins.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{looks like someone's way ahead of me. alright.}
<P>__{(adapts and demonstrates)}
<D>__{to retrieve your mail simply double click the top item in your mail list.}
<P>__{(as she does)}
<D>__{since we're all a part of the same network, we share mail... so go ahead and do that.}
<A>__{the message read: teacher fucks niggers class is dumbstruck. ellen's riveted. now she turns. without losing her temper, she scours the class with a narrow gaze. class starts to buzz. now a clicking frenzy to retrieve the same message. the anonymous message pops up on computer screens all around the classroom. ellen's pov of students (and stevie). deciphering reactions. lingering on stevie's poker face. her own poker face now...}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{whoever sent that message isn't as anonymous as they think.}
<A>__{ellen turns to her console, clicks the reply button. a new mail message window opens up. it's addressed to the anonymous sender, student #00. ellen types in:}
<C>__{go to the office}
<A>__{all the while anticipation builds on stevie's face. he glances around, starting to get nervous. ellen now clicks the send button... stevie's computer beeps... computer voice: "you've got mail..." ... a window opens in the middle of stevie's monitor revealing ellen's return message. class erupts and stevie springs out of his seat...}
<C>__{stevie}
<D>__{'dat's bullshit, man!}
<A>__{he rushes up to the front of the class.}
<C>__{stevie}
<D>__{you best step off, ms. h. cuz you can't prove nuthin'. and i know you can't afford to lose 'dis minimum wage job 'a yers.}
<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(beat and)}
<D>__{you're right, stevie. i can't afford to live in a big house south of the boulevard. like you do.}
<A>__{class erupts again, coming down on stevie and his wanna be poor boy from the streets image. they're laughing at him now, not with him. in a rage, stevie kicks open the hallway door and exits the classroom.}
