<A>__{stewart takes out a comb and drags it dazed and zombie like through his wet hair. inside the darkness of his pocket, he turns over and over a small, worn edged photograph, a smudge of green light allows us to see ada's tumbling face. taking it in the heel of his hand he secretly looks at it. just as the party return and settle he stares on ahead possessed and determined.}
<C>__{stewart}
<D>__{we must get on.}
<A>__{the maoris look at baines bewildered.}

<A>__{sc 16 exterior beach morningsc 16 it is early morning. the sea is calmer and the tide is again low. the party or two europeans and fourteen maori men and women come out on to the beach. about half the maori party head straight for the shoreline where an older woman loudly organises a pipi collection. all sorts of containers are used from flax baskets to shirts with knots in their arms. the rest follow stewart and baines over to the boxes. stewart automatically re combs his hair, patting it against his forehead, where it sticks in a raked pattern. on his head he carefully places a formal top hat, oddly dean compared to his mud splattered suit. the party stops short of the petticoats where a tell tale foot reveals its occupants.}
<C>__{stewart}
<D>__{miss mcgrath, alisdair stewart. you'll have to wake yourself. i've got men here to carry your things.}
<A>__{ada and flora struggle up to find themselves confronted by a group of men and women. the maoris stare curiously and comment on the women.}
<D>__{aut he anahera enci?}

<A>__{a man points at flora's feet and gestures as if holding one of the little shoes in his hand.}
<D>__{te monohi hoki!}
<P>__{(so small!)}
<B>__{subtitled}
<A>__{flora is struck by shyness and hides under her mother's skirt. ada cannot look straight at stewart and stewart also cannot look at her.}
<C>__{stewart}
<D>__{i see you have a good many boxes, i'd like to know what is in each.}
<A>__{as ada does not move stewart is puzzled.}
<C>__{stewart}
<D>__{can you hear me?}
<A>__{ada nods and looks up coldly, insulted by his slow loud speaking.}
<C>__{stewart}
<D>__{well that is good, yes that is good, good.}
<A>__{stewart smiling searches ada's face for some sign of comprehension but is unnerved by her lack of response. he stops smiling, and, patting his hair walks to the closest box. several of the maori party follow behind stewart while one of them closely and particularly mimics him.}
<C>__{stewart}
<D>__{what's in here?}
<A>__{ada points to the writing already on the box saying "crockery and pots".}
<C>__{stewart}
<D>__{ohh, yes so it is, written there, crockery.}
<C>__{stewart}
<D>__{and this one?}
<A>__{ada writes "bedclothes and linen" on the pad around her neck while she writes he takes the opportunity to scrutinise her.}
<C>__{stewart}
<D>__{you're small. i never thought you'd be small.}
<A>__{he walks to another chest}
<C>__{stewart}
<D>__{what's here?}
<A>__{she writes "clothes". the maori mimic also pretends to write. finally he comes to the piano box. he lifts a corner experimentally.}
<C>__{stewart}
<D>__{what's in here then, lead?}
<C>__{flora}
<P>__{(gravely) it's my mother's}
<D>__{piano.}
<C>__{stewart}
<D>__{a piano?}
<A>__{the maoris touch the exposed legs of the piano. stewart speaks to the other european man baines.}
<C>__{stewart}
<D>__{tell them to carry in pairs. those three and those two the black and the red, then the suitcases.}
<A>__{stewart holds baines back a moment.}
<C>__{stewart}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<A>__{stewart nods towards ada. baines thinks a moment then turns towards ada too.}
<C>__{baines}
<D>__{she looks tired.}
<C>__{stewart}
<D>__{she's stunted, that's one thing.}
<A>__{baines walks over to hone a big man and the maorj leader, he stands tall with a great sense of his own importance. (mana)}

<B>__{unsubtitled}
<C>__{hone}
<D>__{e hoal}
<A>__{hone takes an aggressive fighting posture towards baines, insulted that baines should suggest he might carry anything. hone does not carrying, he is the boss. with great dignity hone retreats, too injured to help. other maoris come up and baines assigns them boxes. ada gets worried, the piano is being left alone. she writes on her pad, "the piano?" she shows stewart.}
<C>__{stewart}
<D>__{oh no, it can't come now.}
<C>__{flora}
<D>__{it must come.}
<A>__{stewart looks at flora}
<C>__{flora}
<D>__{she wants it to come.}
<C>__{stewart}
<D>__{yes and so do i, but there are too few of us here to carry it. too heavy}
<A>__{ada writes "i need the piano." her maori mimic copies her.}
<C>__{stewart}
<D>__{do you mean you don't want your kitchenware or your clothes? is that what you mean?}
<A>__{ada signs to flora.}
<C>__{flora}
<D>__{we can't leave the piano}
<C>__{stewart}
<D>__{let us not discuss this further. i am very pleased....}
<A>__{stewart slows down as he watches ada again sign to flora, he has the uncomfortable impression he is being interrupted.}
<C>__{flora}
<D>__{mother wants to know if they could come back directly for it?}
<A>__{stewart is shocked, his mouth hangs slightly open, paused in mid speech. tahu mimics this mouth drop perfectly.}
<C>__{flora}
<D>__{after they have taken the other things?}
<A>__{stewart is growing confused and anxious. his two mimics and their growing audience unnerve him further.}

<P>__{(shouted loudly at tahu) (watch it dry balls is getting touchy.)}
<B>__{subtitled}
<A>__{stewart nods suspiciously towards the maori speaker not understanding him, the speaker smiles and nods back.}
<C>__{stewart}
<D>__{i suggest you prepare for a difficult journey. the bush will tear clothes and the mud is deep in places.}
<A>__{stewart walks away. ada stands beside the piano turned away from the activities. flora pats her hand trying to cheer her. down on the beach a fire is lit and pipis are prepared for cooking. some of the young men are racing naked into the sea.}
<C>__{stewart}
<P>__{(to baines about the maoris)}
<D>__{what are they doing? we don't have time for that.}
<A>__{sc 17 exi beach day sc 17 it is some hours later and the carrying party are beginning to make their way up into the bush. ada still stands beside her piano. flora wants to follow the party. baines comes back along the beach, trailed by a young maori boy, kaha.}
<C>__{baines}
<D>__{mr. stewart asked if i might show you to the path. (ada does not move) ... may i carry something?}
<A>__{ada turns to baines, her face angry and defiant, her eyes full of tears. baines falls back, struck by her show of emotion. ada and flora walk past him toward the bush. sc 18 exterior cliff above beach day sc 18 the party threads its way through the bush along the cliff. ada pauses at the cliff top to see her piano below on the sand, tiny and desolate. its distance and her love of it suddenly strike her. its music is faint and becomes loud over the next scene. sc 19 exterior bush from beach day sc 19 brown feet squelch through the mud, finally followed by dainty boots caked in dirt. the maori leaders of the party have stopped.}
