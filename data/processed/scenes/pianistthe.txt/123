<L>__{interior 2nd apartment day}
<A>__{sunshine floods in through the windows. szpilman lies inert on the bed, weak, starving, ill. the sound of the padlock. he doesn't stir. dorota, no longer pregnant, and michal enter, come to the bed. in whispers:}
<C>__{dorota}
<D>__{wladek? wladek!}
<P>__{(to michal)}
<D>__{i knew it, i knew this would happen!}
<A>__{szpilman barely has strength to open his eyes and focus on them. he mutters incoherently.}
<C>__{dorota}
<D>__{i'm going to get a doctor.}
<C>__{michal}
<D>__{you can't, it's too dangerous.}
<C>__{dorota}
<D>__{i will get dr luczak, we can trust him.}
<C>__{michal}
<D>__{dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.}
<C>__{dorota}
<D>__{he's still a doctor.}
<A>__{she starts for the door.}
<C>__{michal}
<D>__{no, you stay, i will go.}
<A>__{he leaves. the padlock sound. dorota goes to the kitchen, wets a towel, comes back to the bed, kneels it, places the towel on szpilman's brow. he focuses on her, smiles.}
<C>__{dorota}
<D>__{we came to say goodbye. we're going to stay with my mother in otwock.the baby's already there. it's safer. there's talk that the uprising will begin any day now.}
<A>__{szpilman suddenly winces with pain.}
<C>__{dorota}
<D>__{that man szalas should be shot. he's been collecting money on your behalf all over warsaw. apparently, people gave generously. so he collected a tidy sum. he told us he was visiting you daily.}
<A>__{she looks at him; barely audible.}
<C>__{dorota}
<D>__{oh god!}
<A>__{later: szpilman looks up at dr luczak, who has a stethoscope in his ears. dorota and michal stand behind him.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{acute inflammation of the gall bladder. liver the size of a football. but he'll live. i will try to get hold of some levulose, but it's not easy.}
<C>__{dorota}
<D>__{can you visit him again?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{who knows?}
<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{doctor, thank you.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{don't speak. rest.}
<A>__{the doctor and michal leave his line of vision. dorota moves in beside him.}
<C>__{dorota}
<D>__{michal brought food. i will prepare something now for you, then we must go.}
<A>__{szpilman tries again to say something, but he can't, just lies there, distressed.}
