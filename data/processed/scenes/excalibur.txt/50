<L>__{exterior the sword in the stone day}
<A>__{as sir ector ascends the stone, from all parts of the jousting ground knights and squires, the bishop and the clerics, and peasants too, press around. ector lowers the blade into the tight cleft and excalibur sinks to its original position.}
<C>__{sir ector}
<D>__{draw it, son!}
<A>__{sir kay grabs the hilt and pulls without conviction, and the sword doesn't give. eyes downcast, he lets go.}
<C>__{sir kay}
<D>__{sir, i didn't draw the sword. arthur gave it to me.}
<C>__{sir ector}
<D>__{arthur ?!}
<P>__{(spinning around to face him)}
<D>__{how did you get the sword, child?}
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(frightened)}
<D>__{sir... kay needed a sword. his was stolen. i saw excalibur, and... i took it.}
<C>__{sir ector}
<D>__{you freed it, son?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i did, father. i beg your forgiveness.}
<A>__{he starts to kneel but ector pulls him up.}
<C>__{sir ector}
<D>__{try the sword, arthur.}
<A>__{arthur is about to grasp the hilt when uryens and lot, and other nobles, leondegrance of camelyarde, and sir caradoc and sir turquine among the younger, stride up.}
<C>__{uryens}
<D>__{stand back, sir ector, and take your children.}
<C>__{lot}
<D>__{we will try again.}
<A>__{uryens, lot, leondegrance, caradoc, turquine each in turn grapples with the sword, only to be defeated by its immobility. the crowd around the stone is thickening with common folk.}
<C>__{sir ector}
<D>__{let the boy try the sword.}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{let the boy try...}
<A>__{the demand is echoed by peasants and serfs. the great knights remain silent and bitter in their defeat. sir ector pushes arthur to the sword.}
<C>__{sir ector}
<D>__{go ahead, boy. don't be afraid.}
<A>__{the boy hesitates shyly, and then takes the hilt of excalibur and pulls out the sword with a great sweep. the throng is stunned. silence falls. some kneel, following the example of sir ector and sir kay, of the bishop and leondegrance. the other nobles stay back, confused, afraid, angered. arthur stands there, little more than a boy, his cheeks flushed, his soft hair ruffled by the wind, his eyes shining with exultation, awe, and fear. then, as if gaining confidence from the sword itself, he turns it in arcs above his head.}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{we have our king, thanks be to god.}
<A>__{the commoners and some of the knights react with roaring enthusiasm. the others draw closer to uryens and lot and their supporters, closing ranks around them.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{please, father, rise up. i was your son before i became your king... if i am king.}
<A>__{sir ector rises, tears streaming down his cheeks.}
<C>__{sir ector}
<D>__{my lord, you are king, all the more because you are not my son, and i am not your father.}
<A>__{this is quite a shock to the boy king, and to the onlookers.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{who is, then?}
<C>__{sir ector}
<D>__{i don't know. merlin brought you to me when you were newly born and charged me to raise you as my own. at first, i did so because i feared merlin, later because i loved you.}
<A>__{merlin's name is on the lips of all those close by.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{who is merlin?}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{speak of the devil!...}
<A>__{from out of the forest strides merlin, dramatic, cape flowing, eyes crazed as ever, laughing at his own entrance. a crow is perched on his shoulder, and it squawks loudly. annoyed with it, merlin swooshes it away.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{i am merlin. counselor to kings. wizard and beggar. prophet and...}
<P>__{(he drops it)}
<D>__{i have feasted on thunderbolts, i savored my death before i got myself born. i }
<A>__{merlin interrupts himself when his eyes fall on the boy, who is taking in his performance raptly, half awestruck, half amused.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{whose son am i?}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{you are the son of king uther, and the fair igrayne... you are king arthur.}
<A>__{the suspicion and confusion and envy of the lords erupts.}
<C>__{lot}
<D>__{merlin, we haven't forgotten you. this is more of your trickery.}
<C>__{uryens}
<D>__{you're trying to foist a boy of dubious birth upon us. you want to shame us?}
<C>__{lot}
<D>__{lord leondegrance, join us against the boy. surely you can see he is only merlin's tool.}
<C>__{leondegrance}
<D>__{no. i, leondegrance, lord of camelyarde, saw the drawing of uther's sword, and witnessed no trickery. if a boy has been chosen, a boy shall be king.}
<A>__{the crowd of serfs and peasants cheer wildly, and their long suppressed anger against the nobles comes to the fore. they dare to press up against them, fists hammering on their shields as the chant arthur king over and over. dark and scowling, full of rebellion, all the lords except leondegrance begin to withdraw their iron men surrounding them.}
