<L>__{exterior weston house day}
<D>__{a blistering hot late august day. the weston house sits in bucolic, heat weary silence. the driveway no longer crowded with cars. barb stands nearly where she did the night before, in her sweats and robe. watching yet another car go. their rental, bill behind the wheel, backing up. jean in the seat beside him. jean stares blankly at her mother, as she rolls past. bill never looks back. the rental heads down the drive, passing ivy's honda arriving. bill slows for a moment to let ivy pass. then continues on it's way back to tulsa and the airport. ivy pulls in next to bev's big lincoln. climbs out. walks to her sister, looks back to the rental leaving.}
