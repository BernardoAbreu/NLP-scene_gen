<C>__{carla}
<D>__{and the big finish:}
<A>__{vick and stu do a drumroll on the table, excited... then carla pulls out a four foot bronze shield with a bas relief of alan and chastity making out on it. alan just closes his eyes.}

<A>__{alan scowls. then his cellphone rings. he angrily answers it without looking at the caller id.}
