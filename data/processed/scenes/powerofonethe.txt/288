<A>__{at that moment the powder headache strikes. botha bellows, grabbing his head staggering backward. pk runs for the door. as he reaches it a table slams against it, thrown halfway across the room by a powder mad botha. pk jumps out of the way at the last minute. men's faces begin to appear at the iron meshed windows. people start to bang at the door. pk, realizing there is no talking to botha now, does his best to stay out of the charging giant's way. botha charges him. pk sidesteps and hits him with a left hook. the punch has no effect. botha swings out wildly. pk easily dances away. botha picks up another table and heaves it at pk. pk jumps to avoid it, but trips on an overturned stool. he goes down. the miners outside, crowding three deep, yell and shout. people start to make bets. botha charges pk as pk scrambles up. botha swings. the blow glances off pk's shoulder and sends him flying, spinning over a table. botha leaps at pk, driving him into the wall. pk grimaces, sagging. botha picks him up and starts to squeeze him to death in his massive arms. pk, his hands free, starts to pound on botha's ears with his palms. botha screams as the powder head ache accelerates through the top of his skull. he drops pk. pk rolls away and swings a stool at botha's midsection. botha is driven back. pk goes to swing the stool again. botha catches it as if it were made of balsa. he rips it out of pk's hand and flings it back at him, charging behind it. pk goes topping end over end. botha gets a hand on him and lifts him from behind. he flings pk over the bar. pk hits the floor, stunned. botha pulls at the bar trying to get at pk. he rocks the bar and rocks the bar as pk is trying to regain his bearings. finally, with one tremendous rip, the bar comes away from its bolting. botha pulls it aside. pk rises just as botha moves in. pk hits him three solid shots to the stomach but botha hardly feels them. he grabs pk and starts to squeeze him again. face to face, botha's crazed eyes watch the life fade from pk's.}
