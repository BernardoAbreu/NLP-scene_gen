<L>__{interior john's apartment}
<A>__{seems small until you walk in and realize it's as long as a bowling lane. makes that cage enclosed bed at one end seem like it's a mile away. chaz throws the suitcases on it as john arrives.}
<C>__{chaz}
<P>__{(yells across room)}
<D>__{simple question. how much longer do i have to be your slave?}
<A>__{john pulls a chain and a wall of window shutters open.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you're not my slave, chaz. you're my very appreciated assistant. like tonto and robin and that skinny fellow with the fat friend.}
<A>__{along the floor, encircling the entire room, are 5 gallon sparkletts bottles. each is adorned by a small hand marked cross. john takes a moment to adjust one out of place.}
<C>__{chaz}
<D>__{how much longer?}
<A>__{john doesn't like his tone.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{well i don't know, what's the going rate for saving a taxi driver hanging from his fingernails about to be swallowed into the jaws of hell?}
<C>__{chaz}
<D>__{so what time you want me back?}
<A>__{john gives him a knowing look, goes back to emptying his pockets.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i need to make an appearance at midnite's. say ten ish?}

<A>__{this diminutive occult version of bond's "q" carries a custom bowling bag and squints in the light like a mole.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what can i say, beeman, india was a real drain.}

<C>__{john}
<D>__{maybe. incubus in this girl i just exorcized seemed a bit more spirited than usual.}
<A>__{beeman starts pulling things out. first is a frayed rag. then glass containers...}
<C>__{beeman}
<D>__{well, i've got your stone fragments from the road to damascus, dust from the dead sea scrolls oh, you'll love this }
<A>__{out comes a little matchbox with a smiling bug graphic.}
<C>__{beeman}
<D>__{screech beetle from mount sinai.}
<A>__{he shakes the matchbox and the beetle flutters inside. it's wings create an eerie high pitched whirl. john shrugs. so?}
<C>__{beeman}
<D>__{yeah, to you it's nothing but to the fallen like fingernails on a chalkboard.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what is it with you and bugs?}
<A>__{beeman pulls out a set of sculptured brass knuckles. actually solid gold and engraved with religious markings. john takes them, tries them on. nice fit.}
<C>__{beeman}
<D>__{gold was blessed by the bishop anicott during the crusades.}
<A>__{john spots a foot long copper tube in the bag, pulls it out, grips the bicycle handle on one end.}
<C>__{beeman}
<D>__{watch it there.}
<A>__{with this puny little thing? john gives the handle a squeeze and whoooosh ten foot flame belches out.}
<C>__{beeman}
<D>__{dragon's breath.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i thought you couldn't get it anymore.}
<A>__{beeman shrugs, modesty. john starts to put it down on the table and beeman quickly pulls the frayed rag away.}
