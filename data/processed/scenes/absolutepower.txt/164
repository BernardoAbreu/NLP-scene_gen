<L>__{interior museum coffee shop day}
<A>__{they walk in, go to the food line. there is, throughout, a bantering tone. not that it matters, but these two, in a different world, would like each other they're both, in their own ways, deeply moral men.}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{so, do you want my confession now or after coffee?}
<A>__{as luther draws some coffee from an urn }
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(doing the same)}
<D>__{before i send you away for life, i should probably check out your alibi.}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{watched the bullets game with red bransford. prison buddy of mine runs a bar want to question me about the game? i'm probably lying.}
<A>__{they each give the cashier some money and we see a quiet table in the corner as they head for it.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{you been following the case?}
<C>__{luther}
<P>__{(nods vigorously)}
<D>__{i love true crime }
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{ f.b.i. feels only a few guys could have handled something as hard as the sullivan job.}
<P>__{(touches his notebook)}
<D>__{i've got a list here; you're on it.}
<C>__{luther}
<P>__{(nothing shows)}
<D>__{i wish it was true.}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{your robber actually went in the front door but came out down a rope in the dark in the middle of the night?}
<P>__{(as seth nods; luther sighs)}
<D>__{if only i could do stuff like that i'd be the star of my a.a.r.p. meetings.}
<A>__{luther and seth as they sit. seth smiles, looks at luther.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{luther? why was this so hard?}
<A>__{luther. now he's surprised. he kind of smiles.}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{you want me to help solve your case?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{just looking for insight. how would you scratch that how would one go about it? what kind of person do you think i should be looking for?}
<C>__{luther}
<P>__{(like a shot)}
<D>__{older fella. like me.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(now he smiles)}
<D>__{because?}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{need patience. the secret is just research, research, research from everything i've read.}
<A>__{seth. this hasn't gone at all the way he thought and he's starting to get fascinated.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{research for what?}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{well, from what i can tell on the tube, it's not a small house.}
<P>__{(as seth nods)}
<D>__{there had to be an architect, right? you'd be able to tell which one from public records in the library. and once you know the office, you could break in and find the plans and xerox them, get them back before morning.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{not just steal them?}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{seth breaking in isn't hard what's hard is breaking in so no one knows you've been there. now, after the architect, next you'd want the contractor's office and the security company's office.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you know the skill involved breaking the security of a security company?}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{i wonder how those guys do it?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{why go to all that trouble?}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{papers said he kept the money in a vault, yes?}
<P>__{(as seth nods)}
<D>__{well, i'm guessing there was probably some secret way to open it }
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(casually)}
<D>__{ clicker }
<C>__{luther}
<P>__{(fascinated)}
<D>__{ explain }
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{ gizmo looked like a v.c.r. remote }
<C>__{luther}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{ amazing }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{ must have been a lot of money inside.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(sipping casually; a pause)}
<D>__{five million.}
<A>__{and on those words luther, more than he thought, a lot more but of course nothing shows instead he breaks out laughing.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{why's that funny?}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{the way you said it as if you were trying to surprise me.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i was trying to surprise you.}
<C>__{luther}
<P>__{(smiles back)}
<D>__{there you go.}
<A>__{seth sips his coffee, takes out his notebook, opens it.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{would the burglar use a disguise?}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{seth, you've got to get with the program you expect to catch this guy most likely it is a guy, am i right? some kind of weird loner?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{maybe like you.}
<C>__{luther}
<P>__{(couldn't agree more)}
<D>__{i'm the perfect prototype.}
<P>__{(sipping away)}
<D>__{but you see any face often enough, you'll start putting things together. that's why these top guys disguise themselves. i read a great article a couple of years back damn, i wish i could remember where anyway, it was about these makeup experts some of them use wigmakers, people like that.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(flipping a page)}
<D>__{go on about the wigmakers.}
<C>__{luther}
<P>__{(glancing at his watch)}
<D>__{i'd love that but i'm late as it is got to get my pacemaker checked.}
<P>__{(he likes seth)}
<D>__{ all this excitement, you understand.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(and he likes luther)}
<D>__{a) you don't have a pacemaker, and b) i will be back tomorrow.}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{tomorrow is promised to no one.}
<A>__{hold on luther.}
