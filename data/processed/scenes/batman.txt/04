<L>__{exterior side street that moment night}
<A>__{a deserted access street, sidewalks lined with the husks of stripped down cars. mom, dad, and jimmy take a deep breath and march down the darkened street. a voice startles them.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{hey, mister. gimme a dollar?}
<A>__{the voice belongs to a derelict nineteen or twenty, acne scarred who sits between two garbage cans, his palm uplifted. his ratty t shirt reads: 'i love gotham city.' mom, dad, and jimmy pause for the merest of seconds, then move on pretending not to hear.}
<C>__{derelict}
<D>__{mister. how about it. one dollar?}
<P>__{(standing up)}
<D>__{one dollar, man. are you deaf? are you deaf? do you speak english??}
<A>__{by now the tourists are halfway across the street. mercifully, the derelict doesn't seem to be following. they pick up their pace. they don't see the shadowy figure in the alleyway. they don't see the gun until a gloved hand brings it down, butt first, across the back of dad's neck. dad crumples. mom grabs jimmy and backs up against a brick wall, too terrified to scream. the derelict races across the street to join his confederate, the street punk, who's already searching for dad's wallet. mom's mouth opens in panic. they can see she's about to snap so the street punk, still in a crouch, trains his gun on jimmy.}
<C>__{street punk}
<D>__{do the kid a favor, lady. don't scream.}
<A>__{the poor woman is utterly horrified. tears stream down her face. but she keeps her wits about her, stifles the urge to shriek, and hustles jimmy off down the street. the two punks watch them break into a run then chuckle, slap hands, race off in the opposite direction.}
