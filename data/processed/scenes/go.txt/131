<L>__{interior cadillac night}
<A>__{simon fights to regain control, the street outside a blur. over his shoulder, an oncoming yugo can't stop fast enough. the little car hits just in front of the tire, sending the cadillac spinning back the opposite direction. tiny's unconscious body flies out the passenger window. marcus and singh both grab hold. as simon rights the spin, the cadillac brushes past the green street sweeper, still humming along. marcus and singh pull tiny back in, inches away from decapitation. simon finally settles into a lane, checking the rear view mirror.}
