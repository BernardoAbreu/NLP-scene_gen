<C>__{danny}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{verne}
<D>__{you might as well be spitting on her grave every time you put drugs up your nose. or did you just conveniently forget that it was drug dealers who killed my daughter?}
<A>__{verne glares at danny. no forgiveness in his heart.}
<C>__{verne }
<D>__{you ever think you might be buying drugs from the very people who took her life?}
