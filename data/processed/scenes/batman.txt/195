<L>__{interior conference room afternoon}
<A>__{canned applause as the joker marches out onto a makeshift stage to give his quarterly report to the stockholders.}
<C>__{joker}
<D>__{thankya, thankya. ladies and germs, i'm here to tell you... we have had one helluva quarter.}
<A>__{he waves a pointer at three sales charts on portable easels.}
<C>__{joker }
<D>__{panic's up. terror's up. and fear fear's gone straight through the roof. you guys should be proud 'cause i couldn'ta done it without each and every one of you!}
<A>__{more canned applause. the joker takes a bow.}
<C>__{joker }
<D>__{i feel it's time to expand the joker line. i was askin' myself, what are the products that every consumer wants most? and that's when it hit me: the water you drink, and the air you breathe! huh? bingo!}
<P>__{(strutting across stage)}
<D>__{now, some of you have your eye on the profit margin. you're thinkin': this boy's too ambitious. you don't approve. in fact, some of you have been talking about turning me in to the cops. or knocking me off.}
<A>__{he pauses. glares out at the audience. no response.}
<C>__{joker }
<D>__{but that's okay. i understand. not everyone shares my eye for beauty. and just to show there's no hard feelings, i'm throwin' a little shindig tonight and you're all invited!}
<A>__{the canned applause goes right off the meter.}
<C>__{joker }
<D>__{how 'bout it? is everybody happy??}
<A>__{reverse angle the audience familiar faces all around the major players of the gotham underworld. but despite the enormous twisted grins, no one here is laughing or applauding. no one here is living. the joker is playing to a roomful of smiling corpses. one of them topples out of his chair and lands with a plop.}
<C>__{joker}
<D>__{look at that, folks. we got 'em rolling in the aisles!}
