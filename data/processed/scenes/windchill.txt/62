<L>__{exterior hilltop night}
<A>__{a few minutes later he trudges into view. looks around. no sign of our girl.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{hello? hello?}
<A>__{he arrives at the top of the hill. silhouetted against the night sky. treeless. his flashlight finds the few vertical objects still standing.}
<B>__{a ruined building}
<A>__{windowless and long abandoned, its ceiling and walls caved in around a large stone chimney. he crunches inside and examines the black maw of the large stone fireplace, now stuffed with trash and dead leaves. his flashlight beam finds a small iron door built into the side of the chimney.}
<B>__{a firebox.}
<A>__{he kneels in the snow and tugs the little iron door open. gingerly slips his arm inside the firebox. retrieves a bunch of old newspapers. he stuffs them inside the front of his jacket. continues rummaging around in the firebox. as he rises he winces in pain, one hand going to his side. he takes slow breaths until the pain subsides. he turns in a slow circle. his flashlight sweeps over the interior of the abandoned ruins, the beam picking out what look like branches }
<B>__{human hands}
<A>__{frozen into claws, reaching from...}
<B>__{a frozen body.}
<A>__{it's lying on the bare springs of a metal bedframe: teeth clenched in a terrible rictus, icicles dripping from nose, clawlike fingers, eyes. he's so startled he nearly drops the flashlight. the wayward light finding another frozen corpse in a nearby bed mere feet away: another rictus grimace, clawlike fingers seeming to reach for him. and then another. and another... all old men. frozen in their death throes, like the bodies from pompeii. one of the beds is empty. our guy sweeps the flashlight beam to the side and finds the bed's occupant: frozen sitting upright in an old wooden wheelchair. eye to eye with him. he reels in horror, trips, loses the flashlight as he goes sprawling. then recovers, snatching the flashlight up again and sweeping it back in the direction of the frozen bodies and sees nothing: no beds. no old men... just his footprints in the snow.}
