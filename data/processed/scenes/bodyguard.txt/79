<L>__{exterior marron estate driveway dawn}
<A>__{frank has been talking to the uniformed guard in the gate house and now begins walking up the drive toward the man sion. the grounds are quiet, beautiful, misty. we see him from behind some foliage, as if he's being covertly observed, stalked. a twig snaps and he turns sharply. it's rachel. she's dressed in a soft jumpsuit and starts jogging out from behind the bushes towards him. the suit softens her appearance; she looks lovely. her manner, too, has altered; she is charming friendly and very girlish.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{hey! gotcha, didn't i?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you're probably wondering what i'm doing.}
<P>__{(as frank nods)}
<D>__{you didn't know i jogged, did you?}
<A>__{frank shakes his head.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{what's the matter? 'fraid i will get picked off in my snazzy running suit?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no. i'm afraid i will have to jog with you.}
<A>__{they both smile.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{great. i guess i can't do it.}
<A>__{rachel stops pumping, gasps for air, and for one moment, rests a hand on frank's arm to support herself. she removes it quickly.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{will you walk with me a little?}
<A>__{frank nods and they cut off across the grounds.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(hard for her)}
<D>__{i know this is kinda late, but thank you. i'm really glad you're here.}
<P>__{(she looks at him)}
<D>__{i'm going to try to cooperate.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{that would be good.}
<A>__{they walk in silence for few moments. when rachel finally speaks, she sounds genuinely unsure of herself, nervous. it's very appealing. and if it's an act, she's a terrific actress.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{farmer... i have this problem. this minor little problem. you see, i'd like to go out for an evening. just me and a guy. you know...}
<P>__{(makes a funny face)}
<D>__{... like a 'date.' but i can't go out on a date because you have to be with me every minute. i mean, what if he invited me up to his place afterwards? are you going to come, too?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{so the only thing i can figure is for you to take me out.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{so... that's what i was wondering ... you know. what do you think? but only if you want to.}
<A>__{frank is bemused.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{only if you want to... i'm not so bad...}
<P>__{(looks at him)}
<D>__{god, this is embarrassing. i'm gonna run up ahead there. you decide.}
<A>__{she runs up the hill to the pool area, which is now above them. he walks up after her.}
