<A>__{gary takes a manila envelope from phil, opens it.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{your protege's moving so fast we can barely keep up with him.}
<A>__{gary reads the page from the envelope: computer code.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{this is good. who did it?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{'start up not 50 miles from here. kid's on prozac.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{maybe we should all get on it.}
<L>__{interior milo's office day}
<A>__{milo stares at his screen, frustrated. gary enters.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{how's it going?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{maybe i'm going too fast.}
<C>__{gary}
<P>__{(sharply; incredulous)}
<D>__{too fast? at least four companies're on the verge of workable convergence systems, milo, they }
<A>__{catching himself, gary trails off. he sits down, exhales.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{even when i had a hand in every aspect of the company i knew the one thing you can never control is somebody's creative process.}
<A>__{gary seems sincerely contrite. (he needn't be: milo just wants to please him. besides: milo sees he'd like to stop obsessing about convergence, to be a "worldly zillionaire," engrossed in his hobbies; but, after all, what could be more engrossing than skywire?)}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{it's okay. really.}
<C>__{gary}
<P>__{(reaching into his pocket)}
<D>__{take a look at this. slightly different approach.}
<A>__{reading the page gary got from phil, milo knits his brow.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{you did this overnight?}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{you're making me young again.}
