<D>__{you've done a fine job here, sir. the office of national drug control policy is in better shape than when you found it.}

<D>__{when kruschev was forced out, he sat down and wrote two letters and handed them to his successor. he said "when you get into a situation you can't get out of, open the first letter and you'll be saved. and when you get into another situation you can't get out of, open the second." soon enough this guy found himself in a tight place. so he opened the first letter. it said, "blame everything on me." so he blamed the old guy and it worked like a charm.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he got into another situation he couldn't get out of, so he opened the second letter, which read, "sit down and write two letters."}
<A>__{they stare at each other a beat. then landry smiles.}
