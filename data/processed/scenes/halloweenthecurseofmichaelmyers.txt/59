<A>__{tommy paces in his cramped apartment. dark circles under his eyes. a remote control in hand, reviewing his recording of last night's harry simms broadcast:}
<C>__{harry simms }
<D>__{so they're trying to kill you and your baby. don't tell me. your name also happens to be rosemary.}
<C>__{jamie }
<D>__{no, please listen! they're coming ... coming for me and my baby.}
<C>__{harry simms }
<D>__{come on, sweetheart what is this? who's coming?}
<C>__{jamie }
<D>__{it's ... michael ... michael myers!}
<A>__{frustrated, tommy plays it again. adjusts the speed. tries to make out something else in the b.g. jamie's voice comes through. slow. eerie.}
<C>__{jamie }
<P>__{(continuing; slowed)}
<D>__{it's ... michael ... michael myers!}
<A>__{another voice, distant and distorted, filters up behind hers.}
<C>__{announcer }
<D>__{bus 611 from russellville now arriving.}
<A>__{tommy quickly stops the tape, throws on his worn leather bomber jacket and bolts straight out the door. move in on a pair of old newspaper clippings left on the floor. headlines read: "november 5, 1989. jamie lloyd still missing." "november 19, 1989. myers' niece presumed dead."}
