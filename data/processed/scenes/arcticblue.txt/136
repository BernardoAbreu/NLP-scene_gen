<L>__{exterior endicott foothills day}
<A>__{the storm has passed, leaving a fresh covering of powdery snow in drifts like sand dunes. eric and corbett trek toward devil's cauldron through the ever thickening forest. corbett has made them snow goggles by cutting slits in strips of tree bark worn like sunglasses. eric, using a tree branch as a walking stick, still limps on his sore ankle. for the first time, he keeps the magnum stuck in his waistband.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{there's a cabin, maybe twenty miles south of here.}
<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(kneels to adjust his ankle wrap)}
<D>__{too bad we're heading west.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{there's a snowmobile. inside a day we could be on the yukon. i got money there. remember that five thousand? make it ten. be smart. take it and walk away.}
<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(bristling)}
<D>__{you don't get it, do you?}
<A>__{corbett takes advantage of eric's poor peripheral vision from the visor by kneeing eric in the face. eric falls backwards into the snow. corbett takes off like a jackrabbit. eric spits out some blood, shakes the stars out of his eyes and yanks the .357 from under his coat.}
<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{stop!}
<A>__{corbett bounds through the snow, dodging trees and snow covered rocks. eric squeezes off a shot, and is startled by the recoil and the blast. he scrambles to his feet and shoots again. corbett zigzags and disappears from sight over a snowbank. new angle follow corbett corbett runs over a frozen stream, invisible under a cover of snow. suddenly, the ice shatters under him. corbett is immersed in frigid, waist deep water. he gasps from the sudden temperature drop.}
<B>__{eric}
<A>__{hobbles after him, cussing bitterly to himself.}
<B>__{corbett}
<A>__{crawls to solid ground. disoriented from the shock to his system, he rolls over to catch his breath.}
<B>__{wider}
<A>__{eric appears over a snowbank. corbett tries to run, but his frozen, waterlogged legs feel like pig iron. stumbling and panting, he looks for a safe place to cross the stream. eric easily catches up to him. corbett sits in the snow, shivering. he looks up as eric trots over. eric glares at corbett and rubs the bruise on his cheek.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{nothing personal. just wanted to see what you'd do.}
<A>__{noticing corbett's sopping legs, eric becomes furious.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{have to get these wet things off.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{you're not going to slow us down! keep moving!}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{inside of three hours you'd be dragging my dead carcass.}
<A>__{fuming, eric helps corbett up.}
