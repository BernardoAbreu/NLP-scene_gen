<T>__{fade to black:}
<B>__{inside a wagon}
<A>__{a moving circle of light in blackness. as we move closer to the light, it becomes distinguishable as a peephole in the side of a wagon. through the peephole we see a dark overcast sky. it is dusk. we move even closer to the hole. just beside it we see the head of a horse with blinders on moving alongside. we move closer still to see its rider, a policeman. he notices the peephole and leans forward in the saddle, looking in. from outside, we see the peephole and an eye gazing out. the eye is replaced by a plug. the policeman starts back and pulls up on the reins. as he falls behind we see the portrait of the e.m., from the front of the shop in london, on the back of the wagon. the policeman looks at the poster. the wagon moves on out of frame and the policeman slows his horse to a stop. the wagon is being driven by bytes. the boy sits beside him. another policeman rides abreast of him. they ride a few yards more and then the policeman stops by a sign at the fork of the road, reading "aalst 30 km". "brussells 80 km." the policeman gestures for bytes to move on. the wagon continues down the road.}
