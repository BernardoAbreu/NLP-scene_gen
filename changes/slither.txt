Grant slides off the boulder. He kneels and examines the particles. They shimmer in the moonbeams coming down between the trees. Grant peers up the creek from where the particles are coming. He sees a gap on the edge of the creek, where water splashes and is diverted in streamlets down the hill. He approaches the spot, and comes upon a small crater on the side of the creek. The meteorite is inside the crater, but it's cracked into pieces. The rock seems almost organic, like a shell. The shimmery specks are part of the shell itself, flecking off into the creek and rushing downstream. Grant crouches. He touches the meteorite, and feels some sort of goo inside it. It's sticky. He notices a strip of the same slime leading out of the crater itself and into the woods. Grant, curiously, slowly, follows the slimy trail. He comes to a flurry of colorful wild flowers. Something is rustling the flowers ever so slightly. He moves in closer. A gelatinous yellow organism slithers sluggishly between the flowers. The organism is a mound a few inches high, gross and veiny, yet as colorful as the flowers around it. A small cavity on the apex of the organism constricts and expands lightly. I guess it's not worth keeping secret that this thing looks a tad like a bright yellow vagina.}

The thing pulses a little, and surges toward Grant. Grand pokes it again. A small, thin quill -- a SPORE -- emerges from the cavity in the center of the organism. The spore is quivering and, as it trembles upward, little bulbed spurs pop up as well. Grant slowly bends down to look at it when -- The SPORE suddenly SHOOTS OUT.   It strikes Grant in the stomach.}

Kylie SCREAMS. She dives into a small space beneath a rock overhang on the side of the road. She watches what's going on from there. Starla sees the Buick a few yards away. She glances beside her to see the largest diseased deer of all, a HORNED BUCK, careening toward her. She dashes toward the Buick as fast as she can. A TUMOROUS DOE leaps onto Bill, biting into his shoulder and tearing at his flesh, so now he has two deer on him. Bill is bleeding, dizzy, and disoriented, but he's able to turn, just a bit, to see the barrel of his shotgun above him. He tries to scoot himself back as he's being battered. He reaches up for the shotgun; but the tips of his fingers barely graze the muzzle. Starla arrives at the Buick, and starts to crawl into the front seat. But the horned buck is upon her.   He bites into Starla's ankle. She SCREAMS. He yanks back on her, half pulling her onto the road. But Starla grabs onto the steering wheel with all her might, and pulls against the horned buck's massive power. The deer on Trevor starts pulling him off, dragging him down the road as he HOLLERS. Kylie, underneath the rock overhang, watches Bill try to scoot himself back and reach for the shotgun. It's just a little too far away. She works up her nerve and slowly starts to crawl out toward him. As Starla is stretched between the horned buck pulling on her ankle, and her hand on the steering wheel, she's able to flip on her side and turn the keys in the ignition; the ENGINE STARTS. She reaches one hand down to the floorboard, pressing on the gas. The Buick lurches forward, wrenching her away from the horned buck's mouth. Bill reaches again for the barrel of his rifle. It's too far away. But then he sees Kylie, at the butt of the rifle. She reaches out and pushes it just a little, into Bill's hand. Bill grips the muzzle like a baseball bat, and swings it into the face of the deer jumping on him, knocking the beast back. The deer tries to stumble forward again, but its whole head and neck have been knocked askew. It topples over, dead. Bill flips the shotgun forward into his hands. He stuffs the muzzle into the tumorous doe biting into his leg. The deer looks at him. Blood is running down Bill's face and he looks half-crazed. Bill glances down and sees the telephone wire wrapped around her ankle. Bill pulls the trigger, destroying her. He stands, looking around for the deer with Trevor. It has dragged him a fair distance down the street. Bill SHOOTS once, missing it, and again, hitting it straight on. Kylie looks around to see more diseased deer running through the fields toward them. Starla pulls herself into the driver's seat and backs up alongside her friends. Throws open the passenger door.}
