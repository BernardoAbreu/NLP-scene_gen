<L>__{exterior beach morning}
<A>__{the morning tide is coming in. we follow the tide as it laps amidst the rocks and finds chuck, staring out to sea. the empty sea.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{where the fuck are you?}
<A>__{but now he is really thirsty. we walk with chuck up the beach. beneath the palms he sees a couple of coconuts. he picks one of them up and studies it. it's heavy, almost the size of a volleyball. how to get in it? he throws it down on a rock. the coconut just bounces off. he wedges the coconut between two rocks, then throws a rock down on it. it bounces off. he throws down a bigger rock. it smashes on the rocks and chips. chuck picks up the rock. ow! where the rock had chipped the edge is sharp. it cuts him.}

<A>__{the blood stains the rock a bright red. chuck sucks on his finger, then he gets an idea the same idea primitive man first got when he discovered stone tools. he picks up the rock, test the edge. sharp really sharp. he throws another rock down, but it doesn't break. he picks up another rock and strikes the first one. then again, harder. and again. a large flake shoots off. this edge is even sharper. he has a knife. opening the coconut series of shots chuck uses the stone knife to saw at the coconut. no luck. chuck clumsily sharpens a stick with the sharp rock. chuck brings the sharpened stick down hard on the coconut, but the stick slides off, sending the coconut rolling away. chuck positions the stick, pointed end up, in a hole, then slams the coconut down hard on it. success! the green nut of the coconut splits. the brown inner nut is free! he smashes the nut with a rock, but ow! he hits his hand! chuck licks his fingers, but he is so thirsty there's no more saliva. he smashes again. the shell breaks to smithereens. coconut milk splashes everywhere.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{that was smart, really smart.}
<A>__{rotating a nut along its axis and carefully moving his fingers out of the way, he smashes the nut again. the shell splits! the precious liquid splashes out. left inside is a swallow or two, which chuck laps up eagerly. the milky white liquid dribbles down his face.}
