<C>__{thatcher}
<D>__{your honor, mr. flaherty is mr. poplar's court appointed attorney...}
<C>__{judge lee}
<D>__{i know, stu, i appointed him.}
<C>__{thatcher}
<D>__{yeah, well that hardly qualifies him to be leo's guardian. what's the motivation here?}
<A>__{thatcher is turning up the heat. he obviously wants poplar. mike is starting to feel it.}
<C>__{judge lee}
<D>__{mike?}
<A>__{mike looks back at leo who is trying to unscrew the cap on his water bottle, completely uninterested in the proceedings. he makes a decision.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{your honor, leo told me he wants to live at home. he has the money to do that and i want to make sure that happens. if the state can do that then fine.}
<C>__{thatcher}
<D>__{counsel knows we can't do that, your honor.}
<C>__{thatcher }
<D>__{we're spread too thin for that kind of individual attention. but they have an excellent elder care facility in mr. poplar's town. we'll put him there.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{mr. poplar wants to live at home.}
<C>__{judge malone}
