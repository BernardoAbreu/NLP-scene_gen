<A>__{hatsue walks briskly down the crowded hallway, her eyes searching the benches lining the corridor ahead. her view obscured by the crowd hurrying to fight the storm. suddenly... ...she stops. because there. on a bench. sits ishmael. next to him, a round japanese american baby boy of 11 months. before him, squat the boy's sisters, eight and four. all are watching ishmael... ...manipulating a coin. it rolls across his knuckles and back again, with amazing dexterity. then, he snatches it into his palm. holds up his fist. all little eyes are glued. the fist... ...opens. it is empty. there are gasps.}

<D>__{know where it is?}
<A>__{they don't.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{it's in my other hand.}
<A>__{the four year old laughs. her big sister socks her. and mom steps in. the man looks up, with the sweetest smile.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{your mother went to the bathroom. she said i could show them a trick. four year old he doesn't have a other hand!}
<A>__{hatsue is not smiling. nor is she angry. even awkward comes to her in a graceful way. she scoops up her son.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{thank you for your help.}
<P>__{(to the girls)}
<D>__{let's go find obaasan.}
<A>__{and without even glancing at him, she heads off at a brisk pace. the girls following. the four year old turning back to wave once. and then they are gone.}
