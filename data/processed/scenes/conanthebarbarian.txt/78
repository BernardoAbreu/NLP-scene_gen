<L>__{interior galley room night}
<A>__{tamara awakens with a scream, her body resting against the curved hull of the ship.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{no!!!}
<A>__{tamara looks around with a panicked look, until she realizes where she is.}
<C>__{conan }
<D>__{i hope i awoke with less clamor.}
<A>__{their roles reversed, now it is tamara's turn to see conan sitting nearby, drinking from a flask of mead.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{you're drinking? you were near death this time yesterday.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{is there a better reason to drink?}
<A>__{tamara actually manages to laugh.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{do you think i could try some of that? i'm curious of its taste.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{you've never tasted mead?}
<A>__{tamara shrugs, embarrassed. conan hands her flask. she takes a deep swallow, some spilling out over her cheeks. but she doesn't cough, and smiles brightly afterwards.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{it's good.}
<A>__{conan reaches for the flask, but tamara ignores him, taking another swig. it quickly loosens her tongue.}
<C>__{tamara }
<D>__{let me ask you something. once you've killed khalar and claimed your vengeance, then what? you will be free from your ghosts. what of your future, conan?}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{i have no future. it died with my people, as i should have.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{so your life is penance? for what, for living? and when you too die, what do you believe happens then?}
<A>__{conan just shrugs, taking back the mead.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{tamara, her tongue loosened by drink, laughs.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{nothing? i couldn't live without some kind of belief in the world after this.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{i believe in the cold of steel, the warmth of flesh. all else is fairy tales.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{perhaps. but i still die with faith in my heart, belief in something greater than one's self. what will you die with?}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{purpose. i die with purpose.}
