<A>__{inside the barn, the wind is only slightly quieter, and it's darker. bill, starla, and wally are here. bill peers out through the doorway at cattle drinking from the trough. he looks at starla; her head tilts to the side as she nods off. when her head falls all the way, she snaps back up, and catches bill gazing at her. bill nods and smiles. she doesn't smile back; she's embarrassed and miserable and this is the last place she wants to be. they sit there for a moment in the dark.}
