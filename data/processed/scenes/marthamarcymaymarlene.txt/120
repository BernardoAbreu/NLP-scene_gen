<D>__{fucking idiot. what was he doing?}
<A>__{the man from the dock walks past the car. they almost hit him. as they drive away, martha turns to see him get into the a brown car, start the engine and drive. the car drives behind ted's car. martha looks forward for a long moment, then turns back again to see that he is still there. she is frozen with fear, she thinks about saying something but then stops herself. instead she sits in silence.}
