<A>__{thus, mother. slightly cuckoo, a bit out of touch with reality, but no fool. a very intelligent woman really, and very, very gentle and kind. her style, however, takes a little getting used to and her long speech throws rose completely. she stares at mother in speechless open mouthed awe, unable to say a word. the camera moves in closer on rose as she moistens her lips, swallows, tries to talk and can't. she is very, very nervous. now she flinches and looks around as we hear a deep masculine voice over the shot. it is the voice of daddy, mr. hillyer, buddy's father.}
<C>__{daddy's voice}
<D>__{honey, you'll scare the gizzard out of the girl going into the fourth dimension like that.}
<A>__{another angle on daddy in the doorway of the living room. he is a handsome man of about forty with a style and a manner all his own. as extravagant as his remarks often are and funny though he is at times, the man has a courtly southern dignity that is never lost. he is no clown, he is not even a comedian, he is a man and a formidable man at that: all the characters in this story love and fear him. we see now where buddy got his unreadable expression thing and his hands on the hips thing. daddy is unreadable. a straw hat is on the back of his head, a rolled up glenville tribune is in his hand, his hands are on his hips. he is staring with what seems to be stern fierceness at them all, but his attitude really is inscrutable.}

<A>__{daddy walks in as rose stares wide eyed at him. it is obvious he scares the absolute bejesus out of her, she looks actually as if she might faint, her hands trembling on her lap and her knees quivering beneath her cheap and tacky dress. but she has a surprise coming. she is soon to lose all her fear of him, every bit of it. daddy walks over and sits in a chair beside her, stares fiercely at her for a moment, then begins a long speech. again, extravagant as this speech is, he is no clown, he is not "being funny," he means every word he says.}
<C>__{daddy }
<D>__{well, rosebud, now you are here, darling, and i swear to god graceful as the capital letter s. you will adorn our house, rosebud, you will give a glow and a shine to these old walls. if there's one thing i like to have around, it's a frizzy haired blonde. now i assume mrs. hillyer and the children have introduced themselves and made your acquaintance, and so forth and so on?}

<C>__{rose}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{all right. now as head of this household i have a couple of remarks to make. it is my dear wife's belief, which i accept although i do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. you will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us in love and harmony, dear rosebud, in love and harmony. do you understand me?}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(a half whisper)}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{daddy pauses, then in a different tone, his hidden gentleness and kindness are much more plain; as he talks rose's eyes begin to well with tears.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{now, i know you've had some troubles in your life, those... scoundrels in birmingham and so forth trying to... lead you astray. i hope you find a safe haven here, honey, i know you've had a hard time. life can be cruel to a young girl all alone. we welcome you to our home, rosebud, we all welcome you from the heart and hope you are happy here.}

<P>__{(gives mother an aloof glance, then to daddy)}

<C>__{dr. martinson}
<D>__{i am thinking particularly of the other ovary. as a rule i don't believe in removing it. the woman's hormonal system is profoundly disturbed, she is subject to possibly serious depression, she loses many of her secondary sexual characteristics for example, her breasts might shrink and become flabby, facial hair might appear along with a coarsening of the features, and of course her sexual drive is greatly diminished, especially in a girl or young woman. for these reasons i am opposed to removing the other ovary, as a rule. do you follow me?}

<A>__{daddy finally looks up at mother and admits his error like a man.}

<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{are they polar bears, too?}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<P>__{(frowns at cupboard)}
<D>__{good god, the way you live here. this place hasn't been dusted since mother died. look at that goddamned refrigerator.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{got another twenty years in it, boy.}
<P>__{(something seems to be bothering him)}
<D>__{by the way, son, do you recall rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<P>__{(frowns, turns and stares at him)}
<D>__{of course i recall rose. in fact i've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{how could that be, son?}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<D>__{dave wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane her first husband. it's funny you would mention rose. did you hear from her?}
<A>__{willcox pours out whisky.}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(casually)}
<D>__{well, yes, in a manner of speaking. you'll have the back bedroom, son, mother's old art room. just be careful going down the stairs you don't break your yankee neck.}

<A>__{a shot of willcox hillyer and daddy as they walk with their drinks out to the patio.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<D>__{what's all this about rose? what do you mean, you heard from her in a manner of speaking?}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{oh, i heard from her, i got a letter from her, she's fine. but there is some sad news.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<D>__{what sad news? did her cancer come back?}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{oh, no, no, she got all over that. rose is fine. let's sit down, son.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<D>__{is her husband sick or something?}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{no, it's another thing. i was going to write you about it, but since you were coming down anyway i thought i'd wait till you got here. what did dave wilkie have to say?}
<A>__{another angle on willcox hillyer and the aged daddy as they sit on the patio sipping whisky. willcox hillyer is not disturbed or worried about rose, daddy has been very casual and offhand about it and he has no inkling of what the news really is.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<D>__{the pitiful son of a bitch said rose was a nymphomaniac.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{um hmm, and i suppose that incensed you?}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<D>__{you're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. he also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over washington. d.c.}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(nods somberly)}
<D>__{yeah, i know, he was up here. it's pitiful like you say. when he lost rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost rose.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<D>__{he didn't lose her, he threw her away.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{yes, i guess he did. he threw her away and it was the mistake of his life.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<P>__{(staring off pensively into space)}
<D>__{you know, i don't know this town any more. all this traffic, new buildings, prosperity...}
<P>__{(pauses, almost as if in pain)}
<D>__{where have the years gone, daddy? where is the little town i knew as a boy?}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{at rest in the creative universe with mother, son.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<P>__{(a little smile)}
<D>__{that's what she would say herself.}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(simply, he is not emoting)}
<D>__{a wonderful woman, boy.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<D>__{it always gives me a funny feeling to come home. dear old southland. gone. it's all gone, daddy }
<P>__{(a fond little smile)}
<D>__{ except you, you're still here.}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(matter of factly)}
<D>__{not for long, boy. i've outstayed my welcome already.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<D>__{it's funny you would mention rose, i was thinking about her all the way up in the car.}
<P>__{(gives him a glance)}
<D>__{or maybe it isn't so funny.}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(as if in previous thought)}
<D>__{i'm older than hell, boy. but this yankee whisky is mighty fine, i will say that.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<D>__{all right, daddy. we have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(simply, quietly)}
<D>__{no, son, she is dead.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<P>__{(numb with shock, for a}
<D>__{moment can't speak or}
<P>__{think)}
<D>__{dead, rose is dead? you mean... she died?}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{i am afraid so, son. about a week ago. her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<P>__{(in awful shock)}
<D>__{but... but how? she was young! rose wasn't old!}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{she was fifty six, son. of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. the cancer came back, i'm afraid i fibbed about that. but it was very quick, son. she was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<P>__{(in distress, a slightly choked voice)}
<D>__{excuse me, i will be right back.}

<A>__{on willcox hillyer and daddy as the former walks up with his refreshed drink and sits down. he is in control now, his face is expressionless and he is seemingly calm.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<D>__{well, you have knocked me for a hell of a loop, old man. a hell of a loop.}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(simply)}
<D>__{i know. you loved her. so did i. it was an awful shock to me, too. an awful shock. rose was so alive it's hard to believe.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<D>__{i can't believe it, daddy. i know it must be true, but i can't believe it.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{it's true, son. the girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,}
<A>__{daddy pauses, in trouble emotionally, but gets a grip on himself and in an almost dispassionate manner; but powerful feeling is behind his words.}
<C>__{daddy }
<D>__{she got cancer of the breast, was operated on and had a seven year recovery, then after a brief illness passed on in her sleep, as the man with whom she'd lived in beautiful love and harmony for twenty five years held her hand. that is what happened, son, and god rest her lovely soul!}

<A>__{a close shot of willcox hillyer. despite his efforts to control himself, tears are in his eyes. he clenches his teeth, takes a big swallow of his drink. another angle on them both as daddy rises.}

<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{nobody lives forever, boy. who'd want to?}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<D>__{that's a hell of a thing to say. why, rose?}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(stops and firmly)}
<D>__{now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. rose had a good life. she found her. right, didn't she? she triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?}
