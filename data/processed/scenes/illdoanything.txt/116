<L>__{interior backstage late afternoon moving shot burke}
<A>__{music, a tension filled version of "poor bastard." burke's stride was never stronger, his posture never worse; head hunched down into his neck. suddenly, he reacts as he sees: the staff of popcorn pictures grouped together backstage. cathy walking towards the group hurriedly from one direction as burke approaches from the other. seeing his staff has clearly moved burke.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{look at you. you're all here because of what's on the line for me tonight. having this many people in your corner helps more than i would have ever guessed. i'm just very grateful that i made you come.}
<A>__{he starts off, but a jubilant cathy stops him, whispers something. he reacts with excitement.}
<B>__{moving with cathy}
<A>__{she sees matt deep in the wings watching the stage. she calls to him with some urgency.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{matt. matt. matt.}
<A>__{he turns and she beckons him towards her. with some hesitance, he joins her.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i don't want to miss her introduction.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{i will talk fast. it's amazing news. oliver stone's been looking for a comedy and...}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(distracted)}
<D>__{i've got to see my kid.}
<C>__{cathy}
<P>__{(her voice breaking)}
<D>__{...he's doing my picture.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{hey. good.}
<A>__{he starts off.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{part of this involves you. he remembers you from 'platoon' and wants to use you in this one.}
<P>__{(he stops)}
<D>__{got your attention, huh?}
<A>__{matt is terminally disappointed in her last cynical sentence.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{oh, cathy. look, i'm going to watch this. let me talk to you later or tomorrow. thanks for your help. it's good news. gotta go.}
<A>__{from the stage, we hear the voice of the warm up man.}
<D>__{warm up man's voice first, in her first appearance ever, jeannie hobbs...}
<A>__{there is applause. matt's missed her intro.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{shit.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{why couldn't you wait till later? shit.}
<C>__{cathy}
<P>__{(broadly)}
<D>__{i guess it's because i'm just incredibly insensitive to all human needs. i'd ask you to save me, but i'm so far gone, i wouldn't want you to waste your time.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(after a moment)}
<D>__{huh?}
<A>__{she reacts, but he walks off, not wanting to get into it. cathy, however, has had a tricky nerve struck. she continues, biting off each word.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{you know, i don't have a kid or a mate or a talent.}
<P>__{(holding up book bag)}
<D>__{i got this.}
<P>__{(she's quite upset)}
<D>__{and shoot me if i think it's important.}
<A>__{matt's pov cathy, who looks alone and adorable as we hear music of "this lonely life of mine." he puts a comforting hand on her. she speaks nakedly from deep within herself; her eyes downcast.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{you think i'm a superficial jerk.}
<P>__{(and then a whispered afterthought)}
<D>__{you can't be right.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i think you're the best of the bunch.}
<C>__{cathy}
<P>__{(broadly)}
<D>__{oh, great.}
<A>__{and now she raises her eyes big, blue and vulnerable. if this look were returned, "i love yous" could flow they could sink to the floor in a joint epiphany; but there is no romance or kindling in matt's eyes. he is in a hurry. pridefully, cathy turns and walks off in the opposite direction, her flight so instinctive, she forgets her book bag. we hold on this her exit, then:}
