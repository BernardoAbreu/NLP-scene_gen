<L>__{interior bank day}
<A>__{there is a long line of people snaked around the velvet ropes. they're all waiting for their chance at the one open teller window. four men wearing beatles masks(john,paul,george,and ringo)and carrying shotguns enter the bank. john fires a shot in the air, sending everyone into an immediate panic.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{alright folks, this is a robbery. nobody moves yadda, yadda, yadda...}
<A>__{ringo jumps over the teller wall and starts stuffing bills into a bag. as john and paul cover the crowd, george goes to the corner office and puts a gun to the bank manager's head.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{the safe. let's go.}
<C>__{bank manager}
<D>__{okay, just don't hurt anyone.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{yeah, yeah, yeah.}
<A>__{george leads him out by the collar. crash titan smashes through the window and lands in a bold superhero stance with hands on hips.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{well, boys, there's no need for all this just to get the free toaster.}
<A>__{paul cocks his gun.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what are you suppose to be?}
<A>__{we move in for a nice dramatic close up.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{justice.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{well, justice, suck on this...}
<A>__{george, john and paul open fire on titan. he just stands there and yawns as the bullets bounce off him. with their guns empty the three just stare at him in amazement.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{now it's my turn.}
<A>__{he turns to george.}
<C>__{titan }
<D>__{hey, george, here comes the sun.}
<A>__{titan grabs george and throws him into a fluorescent light fixture in the ceiling. paul tries to run for the door. titan snatches the collar of his jacket.}
<C>__{titan }
<D>__{say, paul, your mother should know...that you're a scumbag.}
<A>__{he tosses paul out the window and into a parked delivery}
<B>__{truck.}
<A>__{titan turns around just as john hits him with the butt of his shotgun. it instantly breaks apart in his hands. titan lifts him like a rag doll up into the air.}
<C>__{titan }
<D>__{john, all you need is love...}
<A>__{he throws john who lands on top of a cubical wall groin}
<B>__{first.}
<C>__{titan }
<D>__{...and a good urologist.}
<A>__{titan effortlessly hops over the teller wall to find ringo cowering on the floor. he grabs him by the shirt and lifts him up.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{well, ringo...um...um...you're under arrest.}
