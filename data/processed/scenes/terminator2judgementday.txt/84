<L>__{interior service corridor}
<A>__{john emerges through a firedoor into a long corridor with connects to the parking garage. he's running full out, when around the corner ahead of him comes... terminator. time stretches to nightmarish crawl as john tries to brake to a stop. terminator reaches into the box of roses. slow motion. the cold back steel of the shotgun emerges at the box falls open, the roses spilling to the floor. terminator's boot crushes the flowers as it moves forward. john, transfixed by terror, is trapped in the narrow featureless shooting gallery of the corridor. the shotgun comes up. terminator expressionlessly strides forward. jacks a round into the chamber, slow and fluid. john looks behind him for a place to run. sees the cop coming toward him, pulling his beretta pistol. incredibly, john realizes the cop is aiming his gun at him! john looks back at terminator. he is starting into the black muzzle of the 10 gauge now. aimed right at his head. he realizes he's screwed. then something crazy happens...}
<C>__{terminator}
<D>__{get down.}
<A>__{john instinctively ducks. terminator pulls the trigger. kaboom! the cop catches the shotgun's blast square in the chest just as he fires the pistol. the pistol's shot goes wild. terminator pumps another round into him. the another. and another. advancing a step each time he fires, he empties the shotgun into the cop, blowing his backward down the corridor. the sound is deafening. then silence. the cop lies still on his back.}
