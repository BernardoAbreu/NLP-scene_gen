<A>__{renton's hand flicks through a long row of videos on the floor while the sound of weights being lifted (by tommy) emanates from nearby. most of the videos are feature films or comedy shows, some with titles written in tommy's hand, but two catch renton's attention. they are 100 great goals and tommy and lizzy vol. 1, the latter a handwritten title. renton looks from the video round to tommy, who is engrossed in lifting weights.}
