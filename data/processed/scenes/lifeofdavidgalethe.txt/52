<L>__{interior constance's bedroom night}
<A>__{constance wakes with a jolt, sweating. she gets up and goes into her bathroom.}
<L>__{interior bathroom night}
<A>__{she turns on the light, moves to the sink, opens the medicine cabinet. it's stacked with prescription medicines. suddenly, she turns to the toilette, vomits.}

<L>__{interior barnes & noble coffee house day}
<A>__{david and constance sit by a window, the u.t. campus in the b.g. david's distracted, wearing a suit and a long face. she's wearing the closest thing she has to business attire. she has stacks of paper spread in front of her.}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{okay, let's say we find an innocent on death row. wouldn't matter. corrections would let him go. governor harding would go on tv, say, 'thanks to the good people at deathwatch, the system works.' yeah, if they executed an innocent, and we had absolute, undeniable, in your face proof, we could demand abolition. just like happened in england. are you okay?}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(coming out of it)}
<D>__{sorry. yeah.}
<A>__{he makes an effort, plays the "good listener."}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{but it hasn't happened, not since '76. and won't happen.}
<A>__{david nods.}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{dead men can't make a case.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{and 'almost martyrs' don't count.}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{just keep it rational. the death penalty is expensive and ineffective. no one wants to see a murderer as a victim.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{um hum.}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{and stop that.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{active listening. i hate active listeners. makes me feel like i'm with a dale carnegie grad who cares more about appearing to listen than actually listening. did you bring the amnesty fax?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i can listen and appear to listen at the same time. yeah, no. damn, i left it home.}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{i have a copy.}
<A>__{she looks through her papers, finds the copy in the stack beneath her coffee cup. she starts to hand it to him. he is looking out the window, caught in a thought.}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{you want to tell me what's up.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{nothing. everything. something profoundly stupid happened last night.}
<C>__{constance}
<P>__{(teasing)}
<D>__{i hope you used a condom.}
<A>__{a beat. his reaction tells her the jest hit home.}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{jesus christ, david. was she one of yours?}
<A>__{a longer beat. he holds her eyes.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it was berlin.}
<A>__{she's stunned, then genuinely angry.}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{oh, that's great, great. i can hear the grapevine now. they suspended her so gale could dick her with a clear conscience.}
<A>__{he looks at his coffee, which he hasn't touched.}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{a power differential equals coercion. great. you are so weak.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{constance, you're not my wife. thank god.}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{i know you can tell yourself it's a position i aspire to, but believe me, i would rather...}
<A>__{she trails off. they stare at each other a beat. then, she starts to collect the papers.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i didn't mean }
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{as she collects, she winces, grabs her side.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{yes, let's just go.}
