<D>__{hes expecting you, mr. lassiter...}
<A>__{lassiter doesnt even slow down...}
<L>__{interior alan mintzs office continuous}
<A>__{its jacks old office but you wouldnt know it from the decor...lots of country pine, a fabric sofa, and a play pen where the bar used to be. jack enters, immediately struck by the difference...}
<C>__{lassiter}
<P>__{(to mintz)}
<D>__{alan, this is jack campbell...the one i was telling you about...}
<A>__{mintz, a confident look on his face, gets up from the desk and goes to shake jacks hand.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{jack, of course.}
<A>__{they shake hands.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(appropriately deferential)}
<D>__{mr. mintz.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{please, call me alan. we try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(re: play pen)}
<D>__{i can see that, alan.}
<A>__{a chuckle from mintz.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{you have kids, jack?}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(hesitating, then...)}
<D>__{uh...actually, yes. two... good ones.}
<A>__{another laugh from mintz.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{thats great...}
<P>__{(gesturing to the sofa)}
<D>__{why dont you have a seat?}
<A>__{jack nods, sits down on the plush sofa, mintz and lassiter take the chairs.}
<C>__{alan }
<D>__{so, peter mentioned that you were an avid cnbc watcher but didnt say whether you had any actual wall street experience?}
<A>__{jacks a little taken aback by the question, not realizing he was walking into an interview... he crosses his legs, trying to get comfortable.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i was a sales associate, at e.f. hutton.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{a broker? really. and now youre in the tire business?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{thats right. and auto supply...}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{uh huh. the retail end, i understand.}
<A>__{jack nods...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{mind if i ask what kind of sales you did last year? ballpark...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{we did one point seven million in total revenue...}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{uh huh...one point seven. and what do you project for this year?}
<A>__{jack pauses, analyzing the situation...the patronizing questions, the smirk on mintzs face...}
<C>__{alan }
<D>__{any thoughts at all on that?}
<A>__{as jack stares into their faces, he realizes the extent of his handicap...}
<C>__{alan }
<D>__{jack?}
<A>__{he stops, takes a moment, looking at mintz and lassiter then ...a confident smile.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well, alan, i think were gonna have a banner year. sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{really. so youre projecting what, a tad over two million?}
<A>__{a gleam in jacks eye.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{thats right. and that would make us number one in our market...}
<P>__{(getting up)}
<D>__{you mind if i stand?}
<A>__{a raised eyebrow from mintz. mintz and lassiter follow jack with their eyes as he crosses the room to the desk, pours himself a glass of water...}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{look, i know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year. and i know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger...}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{im not trying to knock the tire business, jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(a confident chuckle)}
<D>__{its okay, alan. i get it. im in your shoes, im thinking exactly the same thing...but heres the thing. business is business. wall street, main street, its all just a bunch of people getting up in the morning, trying to figure out how the hell theyre gonna send their kids to college. its just people...}
<A>__{jacks confidence is throwing mintz off, but lassiter appears intrigued...}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{and i know people.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{im sure you do...}
<C>__{lassiter}
<P>__{(intervening)}
<D>__{lets let the man have his say...}
<A>__{mintz covers his embarrassment with a smile...}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(to mintz)}
<D>__{take you, for instance...}
<C>__{alan}
<P>__{(defensive)}
<D>__{what about me?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you drink about sixteen diet cokes a day. youre an excellent father, but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home. you drink bourbon, but you offer your clients scotch...}
<A>__{jack looks around the office then back to mintz.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{and your wife decorated this office...}
<A>__{a laugh from lassiter as mintz sits there stewing, a caught look on his face.}
<C>__{lassiter}
<D>__{he certainly has your number, alan.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(turning to lassiter)}
<D>__{youre a little tougher, peter.}
<A>__{a raised eyebrow from lassiter, but hes game...}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{for one thing, you like expensive things.}
<C>__{lassiter}
<P>__{(smiling proudly)}
<D>__{thats easy. youve seen my car.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(a chuckle)}
<D>__{okay...you smoke hoyo de monterreys. youre a scotch man, single malt, not because its trendy but because youve been doing it for forty years, and you stay with what works. you have two great loves in your life, your horses and this company. you wept openly the day the dow hit ten thousand...}
<A>__{lassiters impressed.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{and youre a man who prides himself on finding talent in unusual places...}
<C>__{lassiter}
<D>__{oh? and how would you know that?}
<A>__{jack smiles.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{because im here.}
<A>__{on lassiter...nodding his head. mintz, a plastered on smile.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{im prepared to do anything it takes to get this job. start anywhere you need me to start. ill park cars if i to...}
<P>__{(into lassiters eyes)}
<D>__{the biggest part of judging character is knowing yourself. and i know this, i can do this job. give me a chance, peter, i wont let you down.}
<A>__{lassiter returns jacks gaze with equal intensity. in a moment, he turns to mintz.}
<C>__{lassiter}
<P>__{(to mintz)}
<D>__{alan, why dont you show jack around a bit...}
