<A>__{close on marge, weaving on the edge of nancy's bed, stroking the girl's hair. nancy's still something of a wreck, but less than marge.}

<D>__{we'll go away, take a vacation. get your hair colored nice, the way it was. no one will ever know.}

<D>__{this whole room smells of coffee, y'know?}
<A>__{she gathers up nancy's coffee cups and empty nodoz boxes, leans down and kisses her.}
<C>__{marge }
<D>__{it's all over now, baby. the nightmare's over. please.}
<A>__{nancy nods her head, half stubborn, half sadly. she can barely keep her eyes open now.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{she scrunches into her pillow. marge smiles haggardly and shuts off the light, taking the coffee pot with her as she leaves.}

<D>__{night night.}
<A>__{marge smiles, relieved. the girl pulls the blanket around her shoulders. her eyes flutter closed, her breathing becomes regular and deep. once again she's the litle girl marge fantasizes she is. the mother tiptoes out of the room, closing the door behind her. hold on nancy's sleeping face as the door closes. her eyes remain closed another beat, then open wide. she quietly jumps out of bed and shakes herself savagely to scatter the sleep settling so quickly. still in the dark, she fishes a full electric coffepot from under her bed and pours herself a fresh fix into a mug she digs from beneath her pillow. the face illuminated by the neon light on the pot is set in absolute determination. nancy drains the cup, then crosses to her closet, retrieves a pitcher of ice water from behind a heap of clothes and splashes her eyes and the back of her neck. that done she eases open her window and presses her face to the bars, sucking in cool night air until every shred of sleep is gone from her brain. then she starts pulling on clothes.}
