<D>__{look, i'm not blaming anybody, wanda. i'm just saying we left last night and i knew we didn't get that scene.}
<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i thought it was a great scene, nick.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{it was ok; and it's going to be alright. but i'm not settling for ok today. this is a big scene and i'm not leaving till we get it.}

<C>__{nick}
<D>__{no, dolly. we go from close up to wide shot and back to close up in the same shot.}
