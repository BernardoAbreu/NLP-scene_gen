<L>__{exterior brooklyn streets day}
<A>__{a deserted, war zone neighborhood of abandoned, graffittied buildings. a few burnt out cars on the street. welles drives through, watchful. welles drives past a huge two story warehouse, does a u turn. he parks the car.}
<L>__{interior welles' car day}
<A>__{welles checks his gun, returns it to his holster.}
<L>__{exterior brooklyn warehouse day}
<A>__{welles climbs crumbling concrete stairs, looking all directions, crossing a loading dock towards a door...}
<L>__{interior brooklyn warehouse day}
<A>__{welles enters slowly, trying to get his eyes to adjust to the darkness. a vast, empty space looms before him. in the middle of the warehouse, dino velvet stands, in a powder blue suit, holding an archery bow and arrow.}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{there you are. come join us.}
<A>__{there's a wrought iron bed not far from dino. machine is seated on the mattress, a huge man, wearing a leather s+m harness and the same wrestling mask as in the snuff film. welles gathers his courage, walks towards them. dino pulls back on the bow, aiming away across the warehouse. he stands by a table with a quiver of arrows propped up. he shoots an arrow toward a large target... strikes the target dead center, bull's eye. as welles gets closer, he notices several things ... ... a 16mm camera mounted on a tripod, facing the bed, along with several movie lights ... several bowie knifes are laid out on the table, beside a pair of handcuffs... ... machine is watching him as he approaches... welles stops, not far from dino and machine, but keeping his distance. dino's still firing arrows at the target. machine's still staring at welles.}
<C>__{welles}
<P>__{(to machine)}
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{machine just stares at him with bloodshot eyes.}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{you brought the money?}
<C>__{welles}
<P>__{(takes out envelope)}
<D>__{right here.}
<A>__{dino lets fly another arrow... another bull's eye, then turns to look at welles with a smile.}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{excellent.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{where are the women?}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{they should be here any minute.}
<A>__{welles comes forward slowly, places the envelope on the table, beside bowie knifes. he's sweating.}
<C>__{welles}
<P>__{(of the knifes)}
<D>__{what are these for?}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{hmm? oh, the knifes? they're just props. nice, aren't they?}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{dino walks across towards the target.}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{machine and i were just talking about knifes. the beauty of knifes...}
<A>__{dino pulls arrows from the target.}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{he was saying how fascinated he is by their simple ability to be sharp. the ability of a piece of metal to be so thin that it is almost nothing...}
<A>__{dino walks back to the table, replaces the arrows in the quiver, cueing another arrow in is bow.}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{so close to nothingness that it cuts with minimum effort, because it's so non intrusive. flesh is fooled. it blooms open as the blade widens, but by then it's too late, because the knife's already doing its pure, simple damage.}
<A>__{dino shoots another arrow to the target. a clatter attracts welles attention. far across the warehouse, a delivery door rolls upwards. a car with tinted windows drives in... the man who opened the door, silhouetted in sunlight, stays behind to close the door as the car pulls forward...}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{ah, ours guests have arrived.}
<A>__{machine stands. he is a giant. welles takes a few steps back, wary, sweating hard now. the car parks across the warehouse, not far from the target. dino puts another arrow in his bow, pulls it taunt, aims at the target... turns, aims the arrow at welles.}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{mister welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{what are you... ?}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{take out your gun!}
<A>__{welles brings his hand towards his holster...}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{slowly. let me see it.}
<A>__{welles takes out his gun, looks across the warehouse... the silhouetted man is walking this way. can't tell who he is yet. machine heads the direction of the parked car.}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{look, i don't know what this...}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{shut up, cunt! do exactly as i say, or i will put this arrow through your throat.}
<A>__{welles obeys, helpless, dumps the bullets out on the table. the silhouetted man's getting closer. it's eddie poole.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{is that him?}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<P>__{(to welles)}
<D>__{put the gun down, take the handcuffs. handcuff yourself to the bed.}
<A>__{welles obeys, walks to the bed. welles attaches one cuff to the bed's iron rail, fastens the other cuff around his wrist. dino puts down the bow and arrow.}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<P>__{(still to welles)}
<D>__{didn't know what to make of you at first, and you certainly had eddie on pins and needles. but, lo and behold, from out of the blue came an old business acquaintance to explain everything...}
<A>__{welles looks across to the car... the sinister lawyer, longdale, gets out from behind the wheel and hands the keys to machine, walks this way...}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{this is the fucker? motherfucker, doesn't look like anything...}
<A>__{eddie walks around the bed, studies welles. welles watches him. eddie goes to stand behind welles, rushes forward... punches welles in the side of the head. welles goes down, clutching his face.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{doesn't look like shit.}
<A>__{eddie pulls welles to his feet, throws him against the bed, frisking him from head to toe. longdale comes to stand beside dino, nervous, taking out a tiny handgun and pointing it at welles. welles looks up, holding his head, afraid, sits on the bed.}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<P>__{(to welles)}
<D>__{you remember mr. longdale, don't you?}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{i remember him.}
<C>__{longdale}
<D>__{let's get this over with.}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{fine idea.}
<A>__{dino comes to sit on the bed beside welles.}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{you're going to go get the film you received from mrs. christian, bring it here and put it in my hand. and to save time, so we make this as efficient as possible, there's an incentive...}
<A>__{dino puts his fingers in his mouth, lets out a sharp whistle. across the warehouse, machine uses the car keys to open the trunk of the car, pulls someone out... it's max, beaten bloody, bound, face swollen, gagged, hardly conscious. machine throws him to the floor.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{no...}
<A>__{welles tries to go towards max, yanked back by the handcuffs, pulls the bed a few inches, but it's heavy.}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{friend of yours?}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{can you guess what i'm going to say next?}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{he doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{bring the film, or we kill him.}
<A>__{sorrow and rage rises up in welles, but there's no choice.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{i will get it. it's in a safe deposit box, in the city...}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{how cooperative. longdale will keep you company.}
<A>__{dino takes out handcuff keys, throws them to longdale. longdale approaches welles carefully, unlocking him.}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<D>__{don't let longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. if his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will max.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{move it, dirtbag... !}
<A>__{eddie comes to shove welles. welles stumbles to the ground, gets to his feet. welles walks, takes one last glance back towards max. longdale follows.}
<C>__{dino velvet}
<P>__{(watching them go)}
<D>__{do hurry.}
