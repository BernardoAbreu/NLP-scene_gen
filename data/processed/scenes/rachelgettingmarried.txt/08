<C>__{emma}
<D>__{elvis stoyko the figure skater?}
<C>__{rachel}

<C>__{kym}
<D>__{and he skates over to the judges table, all panting and sweaty, with his spangly neil diamond shirt open to the chest...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{there is silence as he stops in front of her, their eyes lock, and he reaches for her hand... and angela takes it!}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{to the roar of the crowd and the shock of the olympic judges!}
<C>__{kym }
<D>__{and he pulls her out of her chair, undoes her hair, and they skate as a pair to the rest of the song!}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{and he gets disqualified but he doesn't care!}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{where'd she get the skates from?}
