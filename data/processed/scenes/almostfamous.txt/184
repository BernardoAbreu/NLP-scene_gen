<A>__{boom. russell attacks him, and they're pulled apart. the band continues moving forward, arriving at a fork in the airport terminals. william stops. this is where he must part company. he stands at the mouth of the next terminal, as the band continues, unaware he's split off. he watches their backs, they've forgotten him. then russell turns, sensing something missing. william. all now stop and turn. still shell shocked, they summon a pre occupied but heartfelt goodbye. william waves. music continues.}
