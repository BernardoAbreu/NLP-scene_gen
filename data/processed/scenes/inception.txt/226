<A>__{close on cobb's face, staring. fixed.}
<C>__{ariadne }
<D>__{cobb? cobb?}
<A>__{ariadne is beside him. they stand on a cliff, dressed in white snowsuits, carrying white painted weapons like wwii commandos. cobb checks his sniper rifle, examines their objective: a massive fortified medical facility a mile below.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{what's down there?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{hopefully, the truth we want fischer to learn.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{i meant what's down there for you?}
<A>__{cobb turns to her. eames, saito and fischer arrive, skiing down from the hill above. cobb pulls eames out of fischer's earshot.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{you're the dreamer. i need you to draw the security away from the complex.}
<C>__{eames}
<D>__{then who guides fischer in? you?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{if i know the route... we could be compromised.}
<A>__{eames looks as cobb, uneasy. ariadne comes over.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{i designed the place.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{no. you're with me.}
<C>__{saito }
<D>__{i could do it.}
<A>__{they turn to saito. saito shrugs at eames. eames smiles.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{eames, brief saito on the route into the complex. what we're looking for is going to be in the most heavily fortified section. that north tower.}
<A>__{cobb moves to fischer. saito coughs. spits. eames sees blood on the snow. looks at saito.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{mr. fischer, you're going in with mr. saito.}
<C>__{fischer}
<D>__{you're not coming in?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{you have to do this on your own. you have to get in there, break into your godfather's mind and find out the truth about your father.}
<A>__{cobb taps fischer's radio mike.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{keep this live at all times. i will be listening in, covering you.}
<P>__{(holds up the sniper rifle)}
<D>__{the windows on the upper floors are big enough that i can cover you from that south tower.}
<A>__{cobb slips into his skis, shoulders his rifle.}
