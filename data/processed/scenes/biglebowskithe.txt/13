<B>__{inside}
<A>__{the dude is shoved in and awkwardly takes a seat facing the rear. the door is slammed behind him.}
<C>__{lebowski}
<D>__{start talking and talk fast you lousy bum!}
<C>__{brandt}
<D>__{we've been frantically trying to reach you, dude.}
<A>__{brandt sits catty corner from the dude; directly across from the dude is the big lebowski, a comforter across his knees.}
<C>__{lebowski}
<D>__{where's my goddamn money, you bum?!}

<C>__{lebowski}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{i the royal we, you know, the editorial i dropped off the money, exactly as per look, i've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh you know?}
<C>__{lebowski}
<D>__{what in god's holy name are you blathering about?}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{i will tell you what i'm blathering about! i got information new shit has come to light and shit, man! she kidnapped herself!}
<A>__{lebowski stares at him, dumbstruck. the dude is encouraged.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{well sure, look at it! young trophy wife, i mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers and that's cool, that's cool but i'm saying, she needs money, and of course they're gonna say they didn't get it 'cause she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey, i mean hasn't that ever occurred to you...? sir?}
<C>__{lebowski}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{no. no mr. lebowski, that had not occurred to me.}
<C>__{brandt}
<D>__{that had not occurred to us, dude.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{well, okay, you're not privy to all the new shit, so uh, you know, but that's what you pay me for. speaking of which, would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? i gotta check this with my accountant of course, but my concern is that, you know, it could bump me into a higher tax }
<C>__{lebowski}
<D>__{brandt, give him the envelope.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{well, okay, if you've already made out the check. brandt is handing him a letter sized envelope which is distended by something inside.}
<C>__{brandt}
<D>__{we received it this morning.}
<A>__{the dude, frowning, untucks its flap, takes out some cotton wadding and unrolls it.}
<C>__{lebowski}
<D>__{since you have failed to achieve, even in the modest task that was your charge, since you have stolen my money, and since you have unrepentantly betrayed my trust.}
<A>__{the wadding, undone, reveals a smaller wad of gauze taped up inside. the dude undoes the tape with his fingernails and starts to unroll the inner package.}
<C>__{lebowski}
<D>__{i have no choice but to tell these bums that they should do whatever is necessary to recover their money from you, jeffrey lebowski. and with brandt as my witness, tell you this: any further harm visited upon bunny, shall be visited tenfold upon your head.}
<A>__{between thumb and forefinger the dude holds up the contents of the package a little toe, with emerald green nail polish.}
<C>__{lebowski}
<D>__{...by god sir. i will not abide another toe.}
<B>__{coffee shop}
<A>__{the dude and walter sit at the counter, both staring off into space, both absently stirring their coffee with little clinking noises.}
