<L>__{int . lily's apartment day}
<A>__{not even the soft morning light can diffuse the reality of this slum pit studio apartment. jake lies next to lily, kissing her neck. a spoon rattles in a glass from the growing rumble of a passing subway train. the rumble rises to an almost deafening volume. jake's a little alarmed. lily, oblivious.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(drowned out by the rumble)}
<D>__{how do you deal with }
<C>__{lily}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(yelling back)}
<D>__{said, how do }
<P>__{(the subway passes)}
<D>__{deal with that?}
<A>__{lily shrugs indifferently.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{do you think we can do it?}
<A>__{jake resumes kissing lily's neck, trying to rekindle some of last night's magic.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{maybe. even if we don't, you'll be alright. you're not in the hole with the king.}
<A>__{lily rolls away from jake. undaunted, jake starts kissing her back.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{who says you have to know the king to be in a whole? i actually did have a real job once. when i was in high school, i worked as a candy striper.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{sounds respectable.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{not the way i did it. i was loaded half the time. i don't know how you could change bedpans sober.}
<C>__{lily }
<D>__{i used to hang out with this guy, glenn. he was an x ray technician or something.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{you want to talk about an old boyfriend right now?}
<A>__{jake, kissing up the length of lily's neck.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{he wasn't my boyfriend. i had a boyfriend at the time... what was his name? anyway, glenn was like thirty. i was only fifteen. but he was a nice guy. real sweet. liked to talk. we used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to morrisey or some stupid shit like that.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{yeah, the sensitive guy thing never worked for me.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{we were friends. i trusted him. i should have known it was weird. but, then again i was weird.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{you guys got busted. this is a great neck.}
<A>__{jake still kissing...}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{no, we never got busted. we were done with a shift one night, both a couple of percocets down and i was telling glenn about my boyfriend, about how we were thinking about doing it, you know? i was thinking about letting him be my first because i loved him.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{what the hell was his name?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{glenn talked you out of it.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{sort of. i was telling him about this great love of my life who's name i don't remember, and i could see... he was getting pissed. i thought it was just because he was worried about me, but...}
<C>__{lily }
<D>__{he told me that i was stupid because my boyfriend didn't really love me.}
<A>__{jake grabs lily and rolls her over onto her back. he climbs on top of her.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{he was looking out for you.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{he said he was going to "fuck some sense into me."}
<A>__{jake stops kissing lily and looks up at her.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{shit, what was that guy's name? i really liked him.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{lily... jesus christ...}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{after glenn was finished, he gave me a couple of valiums and i went home. the next day, i finished my shift and met him around back, like we always did. i stuck a number eight scalpel into his chest. three or four times.}
<A>__{jake slides off lily.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{did, uh... did you kill him?}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{i don't know. i packed up my shit and ran away. to this... so unlike you, i guess i do have something to prove, in a repressed anger sort of way.}
<A>__{jake considers for a second.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{no. you trusted him... you were just getting square.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{you know why i told you that, jake?}
<P>__{(turning towards him)}
<D>__{because i trust you too.}
<A>__{jake tries a reassuring smile even though he's not sure it's something he should be smiling about. the spoon starts to rattle again as another subway train rumbles in the distance.}
