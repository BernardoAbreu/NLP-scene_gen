<L>__{exterior clearing day}
<A>__{a small meadow among towering trees. the fern like "grass" is beaten down in waves by the rotor wash as the samson settles to the ground. jake pulls the massive door gun off its pintle mount and hefts it like an assault rifle. he and wainfleet leap out to secure the lz, scanning the tree line warily, weapons aimed. grace jogs forward to the cockpit, motioning trudy to shut down. trudy kills the samson's turbines. grace, towering over wainfleet, motions him to hang back.}

<D>__{whatever you say, doc.}
