<L>__{interior wills' bedroom later}
<A>__{in grey afternoon shadows, charlotte lies on her side, fully clothed under the covers, with her eyes open, thinking. she hears something and looks back. wills stands in the lighted doorway. she gestures for him to come. he walks over and lies down next to her. she turns her back to him, so that he's spooning her, but she takes hold of his hand, pressing it against her chest and squeezing it like a doll. for a long time, they lie in silence. finally, she murmurs almost inaudibly }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{when we met, i was so lonely. but i didn't even know it. i'd been alone so long.. almost forever...}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{so had i.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{but now we have each other.}
<P>__{(beginning to cry)}
<D>__{oh, what would i do, wills? what would i do if you weren't here? where would i be?}
<A>__{fighting his emotions, determined to stay strong for her, he holds her close.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{you don't ever have to worry about that.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{i will do whatever i have to! i will tear up the papers! whatever you want! tell the doctor! because... i really do want... i don't want to leave you!}
<A>__{the dam breaks and she is wracked by sobs. wills closes his eyes, holds her even tighter, and rocks her in his arms.}
