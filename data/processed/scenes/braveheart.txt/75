<L>__{interior the palace in london day}
<A>__{prince edward and phillip, his fencing friend and lover, hear a contingent of horsemen clatter into the courtyard below; they look out the window and see the arrival of longshanks. they lean back into the room and edward begins to pace nervously.}
<C>__{phillip}
<D>__{it is not your fault! stand up to him.}
<A>__{edward shows phillip the dagger he has concealed in his belt behind his back.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i will stand up to him, and more.}
<A>__{longshanks bangs the door open and stalks in angrily. first he glares at phillip with obvious loathing, then turns his piercing stare to his own son.}
<C>__{longshanks}
<D>__{what news of the north?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{nothing new, majesty. we have sent riders to speed any word.}
<C>__{longshanks}
<D>__{while i am in france fighting to expand your future kingdom i learn that stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! and you have done nothing?!}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i have ordered conscriptions...}
<A>__{a messenger enters and hands the prince a message. edward reads it and nearly loses his balance.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{wallace has sacked york!}
<C>__{longshanks}
<D>__{impossible.}
<P>__{(to messenger)}
<D>__{how dare you bring a panicky lie.}
<A>__{the messenger has also brought a basket. he approaches the central table with great dread and places the basket on it, uncovering its contents. prince edward is closest; he looks in, then staggers back, stunned. longshanks moves to the sack coldly, looks in, and withdraws the severed head of his nephew, york's (former) governor.}
<C>__{phillip}
<D>__{sire! thy own nephew! what beast could do such a thing?!}
<A>__{the king drops the head back into the sack, unmoved.}
<C>__{longshanks}
<D>__{if he can sack york, he can invade lower england.}
<C>__{phillip}
<D>__{we would stop him!}
<C>__{longshanks}
<D>__{edward, who is this shitpoker who speaks to me as if i needed his advice?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i have declared phillip my high counselor.}
<A>__{longshanks nods as if impressed. he moves to phillip and examines the gold chain of office that the young man wears. then longshanks grabs him and throws him out the window, the same one edward and phillip were looking out, six stories above the courtyard. we hear phillip's scream as he falls. edward rushes toward the window in horror. he looks out at the result, turns back toward his father in shock and hatred, and only then remembers the dagger and goes for it. he stabs at longshanks; the old king smiles at the attack, parrying, letting his arms be cut.}
<C>__{longshanks}
<D>__{you fight back at last!}
<A>__{then longshanks unleashes his own hateful fury; he grapples with edward, knocking the dagger away and hurling him to the floor; then longshanks kicks his son, again and again. he exhausts his fury on him. edward is a bloody mess; longshanks coughs up a bit of blood. he ignores it and his son's wreckage, and goes back to the discussion, as if this fight was normal business.}
<C>__{longshanks}
<D>__{we must sue for a truce, and buy him off. but who will go to him? not i. if i came under the sword of this murderer, i would end up like my nephew. and not you, the sight of my faggot son would only encourage an enemy to take over this country. so whom do i send?}
<A>__{longshanks calculates.}
