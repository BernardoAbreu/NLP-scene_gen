<D>__{charlie was always trying to get me to drink beer.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{why do you always call him charlie?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{that was his name.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{why don't you ever say 'your father'?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{sometimes i do, don't i? i don't know. when i think of him, i think of 'charlie.'}
<C>__{doug}

<D>__{you mean another man?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{well, everyone always thinks things are more possible than they are. i mean, single men don't stay in haley if they have any starch. the only eligible man around was drew carter, but he smells like his dog.}

<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i wish i'd remembered the beers sooner. it's nice to see you smiling.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{don't be. everyone has sad times.}
<A>__{doug dissolves into tears. he lowers his head and shields his eyes with his hand. helen leans over and strokes his hair. after a few moments, he rises and wipes away his tears with a dish towel.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i will tell you a secret. i did have a friend. a man in chicago. i used to see him when i went up to chicago to visit bea during summer vacations.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{'used to see him' you don't see him anymore?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{did you like him?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{he was a wonderful man. a little boring, but really, very wonderful.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{how long did this go on?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{about eight years or so, it was when you boys were still at home.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{that's a long time. did you ever think about marrying him?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{he proposed. but, well, obviously, i said no.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{because i'm in love with... your father. with my memory of him. he was the one for me. oh, i don't know... there's different kinds of love, darling. some people you love no matter what. other people you love if the situation is right. to me the best kind of love is the 'no matter what' kind.}
<P>__{(slight beat)}
<D>__{well, i am a cheap drunk, aren't i?}
