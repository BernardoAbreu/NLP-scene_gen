<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{int: video store. day}
<A>__{randal reads a newspaper. an indecisive customer studies the two rental choices she holds. she looks from one movie to the other repeatedly.}
<C>__{indecisive customer}
<P>__{(attempting a solicit help)}
<D>__{they say so much, but they never tell you if it's any good.}
<A>__{randal hardly stirs and continues to read his paper. the indecisive customer half turns to see if her comment was even heard. she tries again, but this time with a different approach.}
<C>__{indecisive customer}
<D>__{are either of these any good?}
<A>__{randal continues to read. the indecisive customer tries harder, then louder and more direct:}
<C>__{indecisive customer}
<D>__{sir!}
<A>__{randal continues to read.}
<C>__{randal}
<P>__{(flatly)}
<D>__{what.}
<A>__{the indecisive customer holds up her rental choices.}
<C>__{indecisive customer}
<P>__{(politely)}
<D>__{are either of these any good?}
<A>__{randal, as always, reads on.}
<C>__{randal}
<P>__{(again, flatly)}
<D>__{i don't watch movies.}
<A>__{the indecisive customer is a tad flabbergasted, but not put off.}
<C>__{indecisive customer}
<D>__{well, have you heard anything about either of them?}
<A>__{randal does his level best to not get involved.}
<C>__{randal}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{the indecisive customer challenges him.}
<C>__{indecisive customer}
<P>__{(in disbelief)}
<D>__{you've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?}
<C>__{randal }
<D>__{i find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.}
<C>__{indecisive customer}
<P>__{(with a new determination)}
<D>__{well, how about these two movies?}
<P>__{(holds up the same two)}
<A>__{randal continues to read his paper, not looking up.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{they suck.}
<A>__{the indecisive customer smirks smugly at randal and his paper. she has caught him.}
<C>__{indecisive customer}
<D>__{i just held up the same two movies. you're not even paying attention.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{no, i wasn't.}
<C>__{indecisive customer}
<D>__{i don't think your manager would appreciate...}
<C>__{randal}
<P>__{(turning the page)}
<D>__{i don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.}
<C>__{indecisive customer}
<D>__{i beg your pardon!}
<C>__{randal}
<P>__{(reading on)}
<D>__{your ruse. your cunning attempt to trick me.}
<C>__{indecisive customer}
<P>__{(defending herself)}
<D>__{i only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what i was saying.}
<C>__{randal}
<P>__{(turning page and reading)}
<D>__{i hope it feels good.}
<C>__{indecisive customer}
<D>__{you hope what feels good?}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{i hope it feels so good to be right. there is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?}
<A>__{the indecisive customer wears a face that belies utter disbelief in the audacity of this most lackadaisical video clerk. the unmoving newspaper illustrates the total disinterest of the news hungry randal. the indecisive customer shakes her head in disgust and throws the movies back onto the wall.}
<C>__{indecisive customer}
<P>__{(in a huff)}
<D>__{well this is the last time i ever rent here...}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{you'll be missed.}
<C>__{indecisive customer}
<P>__{(losing it altogether)}
<D>__{screw you!}
<A>__{she storms out. randal is offended. he hops over the counter and whips the door open.}
<C>__{randal}
<P>__{(calling after her)}
<D>__{you're not allowed to rent here anymore!}
<A>__{randal closes the door and stands there, momentarily, totally appalled by her exiting remark, then shakes his head.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{screw me!}
<A>__{he reaches behind the counter and grabs a ring of keys. exiting, he locks the door behind him from the outside, gives it a tug to ensure its security, and storms off in the opposite direction from the woman.}
