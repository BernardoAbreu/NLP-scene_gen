<A>__{he crosses the room. the bathroom door is ajar, the room leaking steam.}
<L>__{interior bathroom same}
<A>__{sam steps inside, looks at the shower stall an indistinct shape moves there in the steam. san watches, then jerks open the shower door. the steam clears revealing a tall, athletic body, and now the face ray duquette, grinning at sam out of the swirling steam.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{buy you a drink?}
<A>__{san takes a step back.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{jesus. i wasn't expecting you 'til tomorrow.}
<A>__{ray turns off the water, steps out of the stall, wrapping himself in a towel. there's a fresh, raised scar across one shoulder and ray winces a little as he tucks the towel about his waist. he looks at himself in the mirror, touching the scar.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{nice girlfriend you had there.}
<A>__{sam just looks at him.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yeah, well, you fixed that.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what the hell happened, anyway?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{the bitch shot me, is what happened.}
<A>__{sam shakes his head, walks back into the bedroom. ray follows.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{hey, what did you want me to do, die?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something? you weren't supposed to kill her for christ's sake.}
<A>__{now ray just looks at sam, his eyes narrowing.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little suzie toller to death with a wine bottle?}
<P>__{(off sam's silence)}
<D>__{jesus, man. it couldn't have worked out better. they're convinced kelly whacked suzie. i can't talk 'em out of it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we should be celebrating. this thing worked out just like you said, only better.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{kelly was supposed to be framed, not killed.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what i'm telling you is, i don't like surprises.}
<A>__{ray walks to a dresser where a bottle of champagne sits in a bucket of ice. he opens the bottle, fills two glasses. he hands one of the glasses to sam.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{every cloud has a silver lining, partner. here's to no loose ends.}
<A>__{he raises his glass in a toast. sam looks at it, then raises his glass as well. ray smiles. sam doesn't.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{here's to no more surprises.}
<A>__{ray shrugs. the two men's eyes meet. they touch glasses and drink.}
