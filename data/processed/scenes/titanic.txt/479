<L>__{exterior deck carpathia day}
<A>__{it is the afternoon of the 15th. cal is searching the faces of the widows lining the deck, looking for rose. the deck of carpathia is crammed with huddled people, and even the recovered lifeboats of titanic. on a hatch cover sits an enormous pile of lifebelts. he keeps walking toward the stern. seeing cal's tuxedo, a steward approaches him.}
<C>__{carpathia steward}
<A>__{you won't find any of your people back here, sir. it's all steerage. cal ignores him and goes amongst this wrecked group, looking under shawls and blankets at one bleak face after another. rose is sipping hot tea. her eyes focus on him as he approaches her. he barely recognizes her. she looks like a refugee, her matted hair hanging in her eyes.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{yes, i lived. how awkward for you.}
<C>__{cal}
<A>__{rose... your mother and i have been looking for you she holds up her hand, stopping him.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{please don't. don't talk. just listen. we will make a deal, since that is something you understand. from this moment you do not exist for me, nor i for you. you shall not see me again. and you will not attempt to find me. in return i will keep my silence. your actions last night need never come to light, and you will get to keep the honor you have carefully purchased. she fixes him with a glare as cold and hard as the ice which changed their lives.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{is this in any way unclear?}
<C>__{cal}
<P>__{(after a long beat)}
<A>__{what do i tell your mother?}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{tell her that her daughter died with the titanic. she stands, turning to the rail. dismissing him. we see cal stricken with emotion.}
<C>__{cal}
<A>__{you're precious to me, rose.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{jewels are precious. goodbye, mr. hockley. we see that in his way, the only way he knows, he does truly love her. after a moment, he turns and walks away.}
<C>__{old rose }
<A>__{that was the last time i ever saw him. he married, of course, and inherited his millions. the crash of 28 hit his interests hard, and he put a pistol in his mouth that year. his children fought over the scraps of his estate like hyenas, or so i read.}
