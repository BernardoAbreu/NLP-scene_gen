<C>__{willy}
<D>__{brilliant.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{you know, this is really kind of fun. it's like showing some caveman a cigarette lighter.}
<A>__{willy looks down at the gun in his hand. thoughtful.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{this caveman's gonna put you in prison for the rest of your life.}

<D>__{it's still not evidence, willy. there's no prints left by now. nothing ties that gun to me.}

<A>__{crawford frowns. trying to see what willy's getting at.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{first bullet goes into your wife.}
