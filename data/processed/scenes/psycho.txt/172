<L>__{interior norman's private parlor (day)}
<A>__{norman hears sam following, wants to run, to never be reached by this man. he crosses the small room, drawn to the rear window, as if he might fly through it. sam enters, pauses. norman turns, back against the window, as unable to fly away as are the many still, stuffed birds. sam registers a brief flicker of reaction when he sees the birds, but continues to gaze at norman, hard.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i bet your mother knows where the money is. and what you did to get it. and i think she'll tell us.}
<A>__{something self assured and confident in sam's tone gives norman a new, more terrified alarm. he turns his head, glances out the window at the old house. he looks back at sam and there is terror in his voice.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{where's that girl? the girl you came with! where is she?}
<A>__{sam does not respond, smiles a half smile, turns to examine a stuffed owl. norman looks back at the house.}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(a horrible groan)}
<D>__{oh, god!}
