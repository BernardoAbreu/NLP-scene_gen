<A>__{ duke, eyes rigid, flails at the air. no bats anywhere. gonzo casually looks over...}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{what are you yelling about?}
<A>__{duck screeches to the side of the road. the sudden wrench makes gonzo nick his face with his razor.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{never mind. it's your turn to drive.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{no point mentioning these bats. i thought. the poor bastard will see them soon enough.}
<A>__{duke hops out of the car, keeping an eye out for bats, frantically opens the trunk to reveal what looks like a mobile police narcotics lab. duke desperately rifles through the impressive stash.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{we had two bags of grass, seventy five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, a whole galaxy of multi colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers... also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer, a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls.}
<A>__{duke, eyes darting madly as he hears what sounds like the shrieks of bats returning, grabs an assortment along with another six pack of beer slams the trunk shut and dives back into the car.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get locked into a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can.}
<A>__{the red shark races into the distance... on the ground, weakly flapping is a semi squashed, slowly dying animal... a bat?}
