<L>__{exterior mechanical chamber night}
<A>__{dante's inferno: steam, smoke, fire, strange noises, dark areas, and lots of moving engine parts. finnegan leads, followed by trillian, hanover, pantucci, and canton. we can hear their hearts beating. scary shit. finnegan heads for a open hatch. it suddenly slams shut. he instantly veers down another passageway.}
<C>__{pantucci}
<D>__{what the hell is going on!!}
<A>__{finnegan heads for another open hatchway. it also slams shut.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{they're herding us.}
<A>__{finnegan and company keep going.}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<A>__{as they round a corner, the ceiling implodes right in front of them. pipes and other matter crash down. cutting them off. leaving only one route open...a slim passageway.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{like cattle...}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{you're saying they can think?}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{i'm saying they're calling the shots...}
<A>__{finnegan heads toward the passageway.}
<C>__{canton}
<D>__{do we have to go there?}
<A>__{the ceiling left above them begins to torque, and splits. the answer is plain. everyone runs into the passage just as the ceiling comes down.}
