<T>__{hard cut to:}
<L>__{interior snow ice bubble continuous}
<A>__{where mulder's body falls through a ceiling of snowscape crust, landing on his back with a thud on a hard surface. it takes him a moment to catch his breath, somewhat reminiscent of stevie at the beginning of the picture. wincing through the pain. until he turns over, regaining his wits, and his bearings.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{mulder has fallen on a hard, narrow metallic structure. its dull black color a stark contrast to the white ice it's encased in. the bubble has been created by air coming out of vents in the structure, carving out corresponding patterns in the ceiling; softening the ice and snow above.}
<B>__{closer on mulder}
<A>__{rising to his knees, the air from one of these vents blowing onto his face. pulling off the hood of his jacket, looking deep into the vent which is open, ungrated. and big enough for a man to crawl into. which, after considering the hole he's fallen through high above him, is really mulder's only choice.}
