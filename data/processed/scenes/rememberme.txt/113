<L>__{interior charles roth's office later}
<A>__{tyler steps into his father's empty office. it's dark, quiet. he opens the blinds. sunlight fills the room. tyler walks around the office. picking things up, putting them back. tyler sits at his father's desk in his executive chair. he leans back. puts his feet up and his hands behind his head. tyler notices the computer. he turns on the monitor and puts his hand on the mouse but doesn't move it. his hand just stops and stays perfectly still. tyler stares at the monitor where his dad's screen saver is scrolling through photos... these photos are all of his family... "michael's first christmas, tyler's eighth birthday, diane in the hospital with caroline in a pink blanket, charles and his kids build a sand castle at the shore"... they just keep going. tyler finds himself watching a slide show of his life.}
