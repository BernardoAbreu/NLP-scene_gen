<A>__{secreted away out near the edge of the bayou and sitting by a small fire, solomon takes the slip of paper from his fiddle. it is yellowed, showing age, but still usable. dipping the piece of cane a quill into the crushed berries, solomon attempts to write a bit on the paper. the berry juice, too free flowing, is unusable as ink. solomon returns the paper to the fiddle. he has some scraps of food with him, which he snacks on.}
