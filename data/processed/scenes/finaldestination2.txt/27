<D>__{kimberly burroughs, eh? what do you want?}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{i thought...i thought you might be able to help me.}
<C>__{clear}
<P>__{(snicker)}
<D>__{yeah, how?}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{i had a premonition about the route 18 pile up. .. i saved some people. and now i think death is after me.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{nice work. maybe if you're real lucky, you'll wind up in here with me.}
<P>__{(gives kimberly the once over)}
<D>__{but i doubt you'll survive that long.}
<A>__{kimberly flinches.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{it's not just about me. someone i saved died last night in a freak accident. what if the others are in danger, too?}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{what list?}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{death's list. the precise order you're going to die in.}
<A>__{clear's eyes bore into a terrified kimberly's.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{the survivors of flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash. that was death's original design.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<P>__{(sudden realization)}
<D>__{exact order? then i'm next! i was meant to die with my friends, so i'm next!}
<A>__{clear backs away from kimberly as if she were lethal, then stops short.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{but you said someone else died last night. that means death skipped past you. someone must have intervened.}
<P>__{(off kimberly's confusion)}
<D>__{sometime yesterday you must have nearly died, but someone saved you.}
<A>__{kimberly nods, recalling the events.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{officer burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{congratufuckinglations. that makes you last to go. but don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you. always does.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{that still doesn't make sense. you said you die in the same order you were originally meant to. but evan shaeffer died last in my premonition, not first.}
<A>__{clear seems very disturbed by that.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{it's moving backwards? are you sure?}
<A>__{kimberly reluctantly strains to remember something...}
