<A>__{tim waves his hands in caution. back on grant, gennaro, and the rex the rex bends down, bumps the windshield with his nose. just stays there, breathing heavily. in the distance, the flashlight goes on again. the rex raises his head suddenly. grant g rabs his walkie.}

<A>__{the tyrannosaur looks up, growls across the upside down cruiser, opens its huge jaws menacingly, all the time staring at grant and lex. inside the car timmy tries to unwedge himself. a thin trickle of blood runs down his forehead. he's jammed between the crushed roof and the bent bench seat. he can't free himself. the rex begins to shove the cruiser toward grant and lex. they back up but they have very few feet left they're almost at the embankment. but if they don't move, they'll by crushed by the oncoming car. grant slings lex onto his back. she grabs her hands around his neck and digs her feet into his sides. grant begins to climb over the downed fence and into the embankment it's a huge drop! grant grabs a broken cable and lowers himself and lex over the side of the embankment. just in time as the rex shoves the cruiser further. now, the cruiser teeters right on the edge, turning again on its side. tim hangs halfway out of the car, unable to get out further. grant, with lex on his back, slides down the cable, rappelling down the embankment. above, the car looms over them, rocking on the edge. lex looks up and grabs grant so tightly, she chokes him, unknowingly. grant, eyes bulging, sees the danger from above. he pushes off the wall and swings them toward the next hanging cable. he reaches out and grabs the next cable just as the t rex bellows and lowers her head, and gives a final shove. timmy and the cruiser sail into space. timmy screams! grant and lex swing out of the way as the cruiser sails past them. lex screams, squeezing grant's neck even tighter! they watch helplessly as the cruiser bounces off the wall and crash lands into the top of a tree at the base of the wall. grant and lex stare down at the wreck in the tree. timmy can't be seen. grant, choking from lex's grip, grabs her fingers.}
