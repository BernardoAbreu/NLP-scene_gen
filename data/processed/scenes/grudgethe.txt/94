<L>__{78 interior the house entrance day}
<A>__{yoko steps inside. she instinctively slips off her shoes. she calls out, in decent english:}
<C>__{yoko}
<D>__{hi, excuse me?}
<A>__{there's a small envelope with yoko's name resting on a small table by the door. she takes it, opens it. the letter says, simply: "out for a walk, back later."}
<C>__{yoko}
<D>__{emma? it's yoko. i'm coming in.}
<L>__{interior the house living room day}
<A>__{the house is the least "moved into" that we've seen so far: although the main furniture is in place, moving boxes are stacked in every room, in various stages of unpacking. but there's also an unusual amount of mess in the house a disarray, much like the opening sequence, that isn't exactly related to moving in. yoko surveys the room, dismayed by the mess. then she sees emma at the far end of the living room, her back to yoko. she's looking down at something in her hands.}
<C>__{yoko}
<D>__{hi, emma. it's good to see you again.}
<A>__{emma turns. looks blankly at yoko, who approaches. realizing the woman doesn't remember her:}
<C>__{yoko}
<D>__{my name is yoko.}
<A>__{the old woman still gives no sign of recognition. yoko gently takes her arm.}
<C>__{yoko}
<D>__{you should be in bed }
<A>__{then she sees what emma was looking at: the roll of duct tape. she's cut her finger on the serrated cutting blade.}
<C>__{yoko }
<D>__{you shouldn't be playing with this!}
<A>__{shaking her head, yoko takes the duct tape and looks around for a place where emma can't get at it she puts the tape on the stack of books at the top of the bookshelf, next to the scissors (where matthew found them).}
