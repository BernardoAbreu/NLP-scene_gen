<A>__{ mrs. narracott looks on from the house. he glances back at her. her face is full of angry concern for their son. townsfolk begin arriving, climbing the hill to the lower field. ted looks down, ashamed. mrs. narracott looks back at albert, mortified, bruised, setting the plow right again. mrs. narracott moves away from the window, takes a seat, and picks up her knitting. later albert has made no progress. joey is moving, but only in a useless circle.}

<D>__{good boy. good lad. good lad. now walk on. good boy.}
<A>__{more townsfolk clamor to the fence. andrew calls out.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{albie, we're all with ya!}
<A>__{albert tries to encourage him forward but joey still isn't pulling sufficiently. the plow skips uselessly over the surface stones.}
<C>__{lyons}
<D>__{look look look! the plow hasn't even cut yet!}
<A>__{as albert struggles with the plow, he sees dad walking up the hill behind the spectators. he doesn't even turn to his son. joey strains as albert pushes with all his might. we sense the strain on the horse and the inappropriateness of the task. but joey perseveres. the plow limps along.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{do you know i believe we can do it, joey. i knew when i first saw you that you'd be the best of us. that's why he bought you. he knows you've all the courage he never had. i knew when i first saw you that you'd be the one who'd save us.}
<A>__{the plow skips and albert falls. joey's legs buckle and he goes to his knees. albert rushes to his side.}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{whoa. whoa.}
<A>__{lyons calls from the crowd as rain starts to fall.}
<C>__{lyons}
<D>__{you've got no chance, lad. he'll not turn over half an acre. give it up now. you've done well. you've tried hard. you're more of a man than your father.}
<A>__{albert examines the collar he sees it is ripping into joey's flesh. he grabs his shirt, tears a piece off it, tenderly folds it and puts it between joey's shoulder and the collar.}
<C>__{si easton}
<D>__{come on now, mr. lyons, that's a bit rough, isn't it?}
<C>__{lyons}
<P>__{(a shrug:)}
<D>__{well, he'll destroy that horse.}
<A>__{the crowd's beginning to disperse. one of lyons' cronies holds his umbrella as he returns to his car. he passes ted.}
<C>__{lyons }
<D>__{i will be over thursday. give you a day to close it up.}
<A>__{mrs. narracott emerges from the house and heads to the fence holding her knitting in the rain, ignoring the leaving crowds. a sympathetic neighbor hands her:}
<C>__{neighbour}
<D>__{your wool.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, rosie.}
<A>__{lyons passes behind her, almost speaks, but then thinks better of it. as the rain intensifies, albert digs his toe into the wet soil and notices how it has softened. suddenly something flashes through albert's mind. he leaps into action, runs through the rain to shout at joey.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{now, boy! you've got to do it, joey. you don't know, so i'm gonna have to do the knowing for you when the rest of our lives depend on this! so get set to pull and pull straight! and pull hard!}
<A>__{he races back to the plow and sets himself.}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{now, boy! go!}
<A>__{joey pulls firmly and finally the inertia is broken the rain has softened the earth.}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{walk on, joey! walk on! that's it! good boy, joey! good boy!}
<A>__{finally, the plow bites deep into the soil.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{walk on! walk on! walk on! walk on, joey!}
<A>__{at the fence, mrs. narracott looks on in amazement. albert notices a large rock in their path. andrew sees it, too.}
<C>__{andrew }
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{go around it!!}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{whoa, joey! whoa, joey! joey! joey, whoa whoa whoa! joey, stop! you'll break the blade }
<A>__{albert hauls back on the reins, but joey throws his flanks forward, straining and lurching until the plow blade splits the rock completely in half and now the plow moves more easily through the wet ground. the ground yields. soon albert and joey are making great progress. the wet earth slipping open beneath them. andrew is loving it, speaks in wonder.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{will you look at you?}
<A>__{mrs. narracott looks very happy, a smile breaking slowly across her face... the crowd begins to return. lyons notices and looks out from his car sees the plow digging through the field. annoyed at the progress albert's making, he gets out of his car and walks over to mrs. narracott. with great disdain he}
