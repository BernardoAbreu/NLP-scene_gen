<D>__{it makes me curious to see you in this neighborhood. regressing. and, if i can slander my own formative environment, it makes me sad, this regressing. plus, i don't know if it's beyond some cop prick like fucking queenan to pull you out of the staties, and send you after me. i just can't know. i don't know what they do in...that department, anyway.}
