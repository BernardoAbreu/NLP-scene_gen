<L>__{interior body shop night}
<A>__{raphael enters with hector and two gang bangers. the room is filled with low rider cars. working under the hood of a car is felix, 30's, sleazy. raphael walks over and slams the hood down, pinning felix's upper body and squishing his face between the hood and engine.}
<C>__{raphael}
<D>__{someone stole my car tonight!}
<C>__{felix}
<D>__{c'mon raphael, you don't think that i would steal your car?}
<C>__{raphael}
<D>__{you run a chop shop for low riders. yes, i think you'd steal my car.}
<A>__{raphael lifts up the hood and slams it down on felix again.}
<C>__{felix}
<D>__{i swear i didn't. i wouldn't!}
<C>__{raphael}
<D>__{and i should just believe }

<D>__{he told enrique he didn't know anything about his car.}
<C>__{raphael}
<D>__{i don't give a shit about your cousin's car. we're here about my car. so, shut your mouth! you think you can do that? you think you can keep your big mouth shut?}
<A>__{hector is embarrassed as raphael once again berates him in front of the others. raphael picks up a pair of pliers of the workbench. he clamps them down on the tip of felix's nose and squeezes. felix's face fills with pain.}
<C>__{raphael}
<D>__{if i find out you're lying. if i find out you know anything about this i'm going to come back and cut off your nose.}
<A>__{he gives the pliers one last squeeze, then releases felix.}
