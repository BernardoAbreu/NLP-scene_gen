<T>__{hard cut to:}
<B>__{the final moments of the pile up}
<A>__{nora's pacer folds like an accordion, then explodes, followed by evan screaming in the trans am, which gets creamed by the semi!}
<T>__{back to:}
<A>__{kimberly, shaken, does the math.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{yes. in my premonition that nora woman and her kid died first, then evan and then...my friends.}
<A>__{clear is oblivious when kimberly breaks into silent sobs.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{backwards...that's new.}
<A>__{clear sees kimberly crying and softens.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{that's good. get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes.}
<P>__{(off kimberly's confusion)}
<D>__{for the signs.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{signs?}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{if you have the same power as alex, you'll be seeing signs soon. when you see anything creepy or ominous, an in your face irony kinda thing? don't ignore it. it usually means the difference between life and death.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{the songs on the radio.}
<P>__{(to clear)}
<D>__{but wait. i don't understand. why is this even happening to me?}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{that's what alex used to ask himself right up until...}
<A>__{for an instant, we see a gentle side of clear.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{it's obvious you know what you're talking about. you beat it. you have to help us.}
<A>__{clear suddenly toughens up, an abrupt mood shift.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{i didn't beat it; i hid from it. if you were smart you'd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog, because what little life you have left is over as you know it. don't make new friends, don't fall in love, and don't ever bother trying to save others. that's the worst killer of them all.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{how can you say that? what kind of monster are you?}
<A>__{at once, clear, enraged, is in her face, speaking through clenched teeth.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{my family is dead. my friends are dead. and alex...}
<A>__{clear angrily peels a polaroid off the wall and shows it to kimberly. while we don't see the photo, kimberly's horrified face paints a gruesome picture on its own.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{and yes, that's the blade of a fucking ceiling fan in his head.}
<A>__{clear pounds on the door, apparently done with kimberly. a guard opens the door. kimberly, devastated, turns to leave, then summons her courage and turns back to clear.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{know what? i think you're a coward. i think you hide out in here because you're too damn bitter and selfish to care about another living soul. in my opinion, you're already dead.}
<A>__{kimberly leaves, giving clear something to think about.}
