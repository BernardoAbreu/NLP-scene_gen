<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{i wanna kiss ya ya don't have to kiss me back if ya don't feel like it.}
<A>__{rocky softly kisses the woman... her arms hang limp. he puts more passion into the kiss and she starts to respond. her hand glides like smoke up his back. she embraces his neck. the dam of passion erupts. she gives herself freely for the first time in thirty years.}
