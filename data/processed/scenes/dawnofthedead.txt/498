<A>__{with a swell in the music, the band of all four humans charges out of the maintenance corridor and makes a break for the department store. they all wear new double holsters containing hand guns. each has a rifle strapped over his shoulder and another in hand. they wear ammo belts and carry packs with other supplies. the wounded roger is sitting in the big gardening cart which peter earlier used to carry the first supply load out of the store. peter runs, pushing the cart before him. there are only a few creatures on the balcony. the dead things turn in confusion at the sound of the attacking commandos. roger, his hands free to shoot, fires his weapon several times at some of the creatures who are closest.}
