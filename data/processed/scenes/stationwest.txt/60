<A>__{it is no trick. the bandit is down where he fell. when haven turns him over, the man's eyes are already glazed. haven puts his lips close to the dying man's ear.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{who sent you?}
<A>__{the man only glares up at him. haven tries again.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{you're a goner, brother you can talk.}
<A>__{the man holds haven's gaze defiantly and silently as the life goes out of him. haven lowers him back to the ground, rifles his pocket. there are no papers on him, no identification. he stands up. he has the gold back, but he is no closer to rounding up the whole gang than he was before. unless he is looking at the horses, placidly grazing. he goes up to them, ties up the loose lead reins, draws his belt off, and gives them each a sharp crack on the rump with the buckle. they take off across the meadow at a gallop. haven lets them get a good start before he mounts his own horse, and follows after them.}
