<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior cemetery late that afternoon}
<A>__{cary and nikki stroll into view, arm in arm, and look around. the rain has stopped. they are the only living people in the ancient cemetery.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{who all is buried here?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{oh, poets, painters, philosophers }
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{cocoanut?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{no cocoanut. poets, painters, philosophers, musicians.}
<A>__{they've paused. cary looks around, points with his cane.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{there's chopin.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{oh, i practiced him.}
<A>__{he gives her a look and they move on.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{and there's balzac. and there's heloise and abelard.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{oh, tell me about abelise and eloard.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{no, nikki. not abelise and eloard. heloise and abelard.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i really didn't do it on purpose. it was on account of the picon citron. tell me about heloise and abelard.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{well, they're buried here in the same sepulchre side by side.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{why are they buried side by side?}
<A>__{they stop.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{they were the world's most famous lovers.}
<P>__{(looks off, points with his cane)}
<D>__{there's the tomb.}
<A>__{they approach the large tomb which is fenced off by a low iron gate. cary removes his hat, nikki peers at the double sepulchre through her lorgnette.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{tell me about the world's most famous lovers.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{well, abelard was a scholastic philosopher }
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{whatever that is.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{whatever that is. he gained a footing in a certain household as tutor to a maiden called heloise. and employed his unlimited opportunities for the purpose of well, betrayal. not, however, unmixed with real love. he carried her off to brittany.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{tell me more.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{well, her uncle was furious. he blamed abelard for the whole thing. he conceived a terrible revenge.}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(uneasy)}
<D>__{i'm afraid for abelard.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{he broke into abelard's apartment one night and perpetrated upon him the most brutal punishment.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{oh, dear.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{the lovers were forced to live their lives apart. but when they died, they were buried here side by side.}
<P>__{(peers down at the ground)}
<D>__{there's a story that little heart shaped stones are supposed to grow around the tomb.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{heart shaped stones?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{and lovers come and find them and exchange them with each other.}
<P>__{(looks at nikki)}
<D>__{and, so long as you keep the stone from the tomb of heloise and abelard, no harm can come to your true love.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{how perfectly beautiful.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{isn't that a quaint legend?}
<A>__{they crouch at the iron bars of the gate surrounding the tomb and take off their gloves under the following:}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{do you think i might find a heart shaped stone? you help me, cary.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{all right, nikki. only we have to leave soon.}
<P>__{(looks off)}
<D>__{they close up the place.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{just as soon as we find our stones.}
<A>__{they reach through the gate to poke at the rocks and gravel surrounding the tomb. after a moment, nikki rises and walks off excitedly with a stone in her hand.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{i found one! where's yours?}
<A>__{cary, too, finds a stone and rises to join her. nikki and cary's hands as the couple sits near the tomb. they show each other the stones in their upturned hands. nikki takes the heart shaped stone from her palm and places it in cary's stiff, weathered hand. then she transfers his stone to her hand.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{and, now, you take mine. and i will take yours.}
<A>__{they close their hands over the stones as we pull back to a wider view of nikki and cary smiling at one another.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{isn't that the way the story goes?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{that's right, nikki.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{and, now, no harm can come to our true love.}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{and, now, we'll have to go.}
<A>__{he starts to rise but she puts a hand on his arm.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{you were so nice to let me come with you. i spoiled your whole day. you were going to do something else, weren't you?}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(looks away)}
<D>__{doesn't matter.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{well, what was it, cary? why did you come here today?}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(not looking at her)}
<D>__{to pay my respects to an old comrade.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{oh. and you wanted to be alone. i'm sorry. oh, i'm so sorry.}
<P>__{(begins to weep softly)}
<D>__{don't pay any attention to me, cary. i can't help it. you make me cry.}
<A>__{he stares at her, astonished, as she rambles on.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{oh, don't look so troubled, cary. i'm all right. i just want to cry for a minute.}
<P>__{(puts a hand on his shoulder)}
<D>__{on account of you're so nice. you're so clean, cary. and your teeth are so white. you're so civilized. you don't care about anything any more, nor anybody. nothing makes any difference to you. nothing can touch you.}
<P>__{(realizes)}
<D>__{why, you're lost. you're all lost. you and shep and the rest of you.}
<P>__{(takes his hand)}
<D>__{oh, i want to do something for you. i want to help you.}
<P>__{(looks at his wrist)}
<D>__{let me wash your bracelet, cary.}
<P>__{(points)}
<D>__{why, see? the silver's all tarnished. the silver's all tarnished.}
<P>__{(removes his bracelet)}
<D>__{i will take it with me and scrub it when i get home. i will polish it with my nail brush.}
<A>__{nikki turns to put the bracelet in her purse. thoroughly unnerved by this emotional outburst, cary looks around.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{it's getting dark.}
<A>__{cary rises, deeply uncomfortable. nikki tries to make amends.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{well ...}
<P>__{(rises, cheerily)}
<D>__{anyway, we found a name for my turtles!}
<A>__{cary turns and looks at her, amazed.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{heloise and abelard? a name for your turtles? so that's what you were looking for. i might have known how it would end.}
<A>__{he looks down at the heart shaped stone held awkwardly in his stiff hand. his thumb brushes the stone and it falls to the ground.}
