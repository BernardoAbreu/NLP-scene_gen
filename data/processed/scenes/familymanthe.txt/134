<A>__{jack...standing in front of the desk, nursing a drink. he looks at lassiters business card, sitting on the surface of the desk... he gazes around the room...his eyes coming to rest on a bookshelf...a book... he moves toward it...looking at its spine...its a tattered copy of vonneguts cats cradle. he pulls it off the shelf, theres something inside...a bookmark... ...a pan am ticket jacket sleeve... ...inside...a boarding pass...from: london heathrow, to: new york jfk, 10 4 87. he looks at it...somethings not right...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{from london to new york...?}
<P>__{(looking up)}
<D>__{i came back...}
<A>__{then...a noise... jack turns and sees kate walking into the doorway, standing there...she sees jack holding the pan am ticket sleeve.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{our finest moment, right...}
<A>__{a quizzical look from jack.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{when you got on that plane i was sure it was over. i left the airport afraid id never see you again. and then you showed up the very next day...}
<P>__{(a wistful smile)}
<D>__{that was a good surprise...}
<A>__{she continues into the room, leaning against a bookshelf.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{i think about you on that plane, about what must have been going through your mind...you sitting there imagining our life together, our life apart...i think about the decision you made...}
<A>__{jack watches her as she lets out a small sigh.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{maybe i was being naive but i believed wed grow old together in this house. that wed spend holidays here, have g randchildren visit us here. i had this image of us all grey and wrinkly, me working in the garden, you repainting the deck...}
<A>__{kate smiles gently as she pictures this.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{things change, right? people change...}
<P>__{(pausing)}
<D>__{if you need this, jack, i mean really need this, i will take these children from a life they love, and take myself from the only home weve ever shared, and move wherever you need to go. ill do that because i love you...}
<A>__{the words are like a warm embrace for jack...}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{i love you, jack. and thats more important to me than our address...}
<A>__{kate smiles lovingly at jack...she walks over to him, kisses him gently on the forehead.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{i choose us.}
<A>__{she turns and heads out of the room, leaving him there, the boarding pass still in hand, staring lovingly at her as she goes...}
