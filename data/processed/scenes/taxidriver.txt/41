<A>__{later. travis, his shirt still revealing his bare chest, sits on his straight backed chair watching the tv. the .44 magnum rests on his lap. the tv is broadcasting rock time, a late afternoon local teenage dance and rock show. on screen young teenyboppers are dancing, and the tv cameraman, as any devotee of the genre knows, is relentlessly zooming in on their firm young breasts, fannies and crotches a sensibility which reflects travis' own. these supper hour rock dance shows are the most unabashedly voyeuristic form of broadcasting the medium has yet developed. the hard rock number ends, and the tv camera cuts to the local disc jockey, a hirsute plastic looking man about 35. five scrumptious teenyboppers are literally hanging on his shoulders and arms, their faces turned up to him in droolish awe. out of his mouth comes an incessant stream of disc jockey blather. he is the complete asshole; i don't know who is currently performing this function in new york, but in los angeles his name is real don steele.}

<A>__{travis watches the show, his face hard and unmoving. he is, as the scriptures would say, pondering all these things in his heart. why is it the assholes get all the beautiful young chicks? he takes a swig of peach brandy.}
