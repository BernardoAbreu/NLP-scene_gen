<L>__{exterior clasky house driveway day}
<A>__{the biggest, baddest, blackest suv..there is some subtle custom work so the vehicle impacts us in ways we cannot quite fathom. deborah is wiping away a tear as she gets in and shares a woman to woman moment with flor.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{fuckin' hombres, huh?}
<A>__{she sniffles. flor nods uncertainly. a small voice from the back seat..georgie..}
<C>__{georgie}
<D>__{i just didn't want to sing last night.}
<C>__{deborah's voice}
<P>__{(hurt)}
<D>__{yeah. well you said you would..you said you wanted to. i asked you five times. then when i have the whole party paying attention you refused.}
<A>__{as she puts the car in gear...georgie sings insanely well. but he's just two lines into an old blues standard:}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{it doesn't do any good now, georgie.}
<A>__{she presses a button on her dash and a glass partition comes up between front and back seat thereby cutting him off in mid song. flor is utterly baffled by the notion of putting a divider between parent and child. but deborah is calling for her to pay attention to the car's navigation screen.. a spanish voice says, "route guidance system starting."}
<C>__{deborah }
<D>__{i've programmed it for spanish.. look, it will take you anywhere and then back home. if you figured out how to make coffee on that thing it's all downhill.}
<A>__{the male spanish voice talks about imminent left turns. flor is thrown by the amount of oddness..all the while georgie is singing his little heart out in the back seat. flor,amused by the boy, suppresses a smile...maybe the first time in her life she's had to suppress joy. but deborah never misses anything.}
<D>__{deborah (to flor) (cont'd) this is stop gap..you, kiddo, you're going to have to learn english.}
