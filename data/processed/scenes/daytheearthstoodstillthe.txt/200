<A>__{as klaatu steps out from behind the sliding panel where he has changed into his "other world" tunic.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{gort and i will be leaving soon.}
<A>__{helen is genuinely upset at the thought of his leaving and the knowledge that he is to die. there is a compelling warmth of feeling between these two.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(simply, sincerely)}
<D>__{we'll miss you very much bobby and i.}
<P>__{(smiling to conceal her real feelings)}
<D>__{he won't have anyone to play with.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{he'll have you and tom.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(quietly definitely)}
<D>__{no. that's all finished.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(she is sensible and}
<D>__{objective, but not}
<P>__{unfeeling)}
<D>__{i think i'm very lucky. you don't always get a chance to recognize a mistake before you make it.}
<A>__{klaatu looks at her in warm, considered admiration. then he moves to one side of the cabin and flips a switch. suddenly an entire section of the side wall is made transparent. through it, as through a screen, we can see out into the building. most of the chairs are already occupied, and latecomers are still moving in through the door. facing the group, on a little dais, is barnhardt. as klaatu and helen watch, barnhardt raps for order and begins to speak. his voice comes in the ship through a speaker.}
