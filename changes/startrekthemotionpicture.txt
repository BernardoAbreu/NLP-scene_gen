<ACTION>__{Then Kirk touches a control on his tricorder exactly as Decker did earlier. Then he looks up, reacts as he sees Decker holding his own tricorder up -- and a smile playing on Decker's face.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ACTION ANGLE}
<ACTION>__{as Kirk suddenly pivots, races toward Decker -- but he passes too close to the "Ilia"-probe. It sends him spinning back, tumbling to his knees.}

<ACTION>__{And then Decker shoves the tricorder into the access hatch. VARIOUS EFFECTS SHOTS - DECKER BEING FUSED - V'GER TRANSCENDING (S) For just an instant nothing happens -- and then a BLINDING SHAFT OF LIGHT STRIKES Decker. The color becomes BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER, begins spiraling through the room. "Ilia" stes toward Decker, is caught in the LIGHT, and instantly VANISHES in a BRILLIANT WHITE GLOW. We SEE Decker seeming to grow larger -- as if his molecular pattern is expanding. A SPECTACULAR SERIES OF VISUALS., THE SPIRALING LIGHT enveloping the entire area. All this emanating from Decker's body, becoming LARGER -- also BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER until now it is almost transparent . And the SPIRALING now expanding in all directions, and the room itself starting to dissolve , vanishing into nothingness -- and all commencing to slip into the new dimension. Kirk, Spock and McCoy stand transfixed another instant. Around them, V'ger seems to be TRANSFORMING INTO BRIL- LIANT, LOVELY PATTERNS. They all turn and race into the complex in the direction of their vessel.}

<ACTION>__{which shows now only space and its familiar star patterns. All gaze at the viewer, awed at what they've seen and undergone.
