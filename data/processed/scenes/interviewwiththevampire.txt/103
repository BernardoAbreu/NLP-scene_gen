<A>__{louis walks briskly, head bowed.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{for a time we had been almost human, in the sensual whirl of what paris had to offer. but the human delights of that city only served to remind her of the ageless child she had become. i felt her pain as i walked until i become aware that i was being followed.}
<A>__{closeup louis' feet walking. a step echoes his. louis stops. turns, sees nothing. then walks again. the echoing steps begin again. louis again. sees a shadow, flitting.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{claudia!}
<A>__{nothing. he walks again, hears the same effect. then he stops. he stares at a gaslamp opposite.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{so it was when i had given up the search for vampires that a vampire found me...}
<A>__{santiago, a tall vampire, materializes under the gaslight. and louis gradually realizes that this vampire has assumed the same attitude, posture, clothes and hair style as louis. louis gives an involuntary shake of the head. santiago mimics. louis takes a step forwards. santiago mimics. louis folds his arms. santiago mimics.}
<D>__{louis & statiago}
<P>__{(simultaneously)}
<D>__{clever.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{you mean me harm?}
<C>__{santiago}
<P>__{(a beat later)}
<D>__{you mean me harm?}
<A>__{louis calculates.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{trickster. buffoon!}
<A>__{santiago echoes the first word, but not the second. louis has broken his composure. he turns his back on santiago, only to come face to face with santiago right in front of him. again louis turns this back to find santiago facing him. louis turns, glowers, refusing to look at him.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i've searched the world for an immortal and this is what i find?}
<A>__{slowly he looks up. santiago draws close, breaking the mirror trick and suddenly slams louis back against the wall. louis is furious. he regains his balance, strikes out at santiago and when santiago vanishes, to reappear behind him, louis slams back his elbow into his midriff. santiago staggers, amazed and then rushes at louis, throwing him down. louis rolls back to his feet, then to his amazement sees two vampires, on in front, on behind. he looks both ways, then sees one has vanished. he stares, awestruck, at this new one:}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{he looks like an angel.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{you are all right.}
<A>__{he reaches into his waistcoat, takes an engraved invitation out of his pocket and thrusts it at louis. louis reads it aloud, as we see: "theatre des vampires by special invitation friday, 9 p.m."}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{bring the petit beauty with you. no one will harm you. i won't allow it. remember my name. armand.}
<A>__{armand bows and vanishes. louis listens to the silence.}
