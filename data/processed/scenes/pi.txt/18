<D>__{tuesday, september second, eighteen twelve. if sol hadn't gotten sick who knows where math would be. he spent years in the numbers of pi. searching for meaning, for order.}
<A>__{max notices a skinny man in a business suit staring at him. the man catches max's eye and looks away, but then he quickly looks back, making max turn away. he looks down at his wall street journal and draws a circle with its diameter then he writes "a=pir2" and "c=2pir." next he writes "pi=3.14159..."}

<D>__{three point one four...off into infinity and maybe insanity. somewhere in there he wanted sanity. sanity like he found in the circles pi represented. simple, sane circles. if only the stock market had circles. some type of sanity. some type of form, of shape.}
<A>__{suddenly, max hears someone singing. max looks up. it is the skinny man and he's singing with passion. it's all very strange to max, who nervously looks away. and then the singing stops mid verse max looks up and the man is gone. vanished. max looks aroundno one in sight.}
