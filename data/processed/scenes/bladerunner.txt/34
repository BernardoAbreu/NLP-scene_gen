<L>__{interior tyrell corporation air filtered corridor day}
<A>__{they pass into a canopied, air filtered corridor. deckard doesn't answer the question because he's looking at the animals. small northern animals in neat "en vironmental" cages. he looks at the rabbit, the raccoon and the squirrel, but the owl asleep on its perch stops him. the armed guard at the exit never takes his eyes off them.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{you like our owl?}
<A>__{deckard nods. rachael claps her hands. the owl opens its yellow eyes and blinks at them.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{it's artificial?}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{of course not.}
<A>__{hands thrust in her pockets, she strides off towards the exit without looking back. the exit is another tube. just big enough for two. no room for excess. he tries to ignore her cool appraising stare.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{you're in a very unique position, mr. deckard. you could affect the future of this entire organization according to how you work your little test.}
<A>__{deckard has nothing to say.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{are you apprehensive?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{why should i be?}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{for the responsibility of your power. being a police bureaucrat, you've got more than your share.}
<A>__{the door slides open. deckard looks down at her.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{you got it wrong, girl. i work with the bureau not for them.}
<A>__{he lets it sink in.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{my job isn't to detect malfunctioning andies, it's to eliminate them. the more the better.}
<A>__{he walks out of the elevator first.}
