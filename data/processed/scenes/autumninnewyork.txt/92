<A>__{wills stands with patty in the driveway in front of the glass lobby. he is distracted and terribly anxious. she looks as though she expects, at the very least, a kiss }
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{thank you so much. i had such a great time.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{good. i'm... i'm glad.}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{didn't you?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{patty, i... i want to be honest with you... right now, from the start... so there's no room for misunderstanding. i didn't have a good time, but it's nothing personal. i just split up with someone and rather than admit to myself how much i miss her, i asked you out instead. and it's unfair. if i feel sad i should just feel sad and not try to use you... and your body... as some sort of painkiller, right?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{anyway, i think you're a warm and engaging woman and i wish you all the best.}
<A>__{relieved to have unburdened himself of the truth, he shakes her hand. patty, utterly baffled, doesn't know what hit her.}
