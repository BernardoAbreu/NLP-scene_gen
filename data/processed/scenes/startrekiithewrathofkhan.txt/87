<A>__{the beam sound screeches, then settles into its comfort able mode as the five figures fluctuate, fade, then appear. they look around in wonder and relief.}
<C>__{saavik}
<D>__{admiral }
<A>__{she indicates something o.s. they cross as camera reveals a cave wall stacked with technical materials and crowned by a large projectile, a giant version of the model we saw earlier. they stare. (n.b. feature genesis arming control box.)}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{genesis, i presume.}
<A>__{they walk by a group of crates. it all happens very fast: david leaps out and tackles kirk, throwing him to the ground and landing atop him, a knife at his throat. at the same time, bones and saavik reach for their phasers, but jedda, already armed, steps out. he has them covered and helpless.}
<B>__{angle favoring david}
<C>__{david}

<P>__{(takes a breath)}
<D>__{you do that and you'll have murdered your father.}
<A>__{all react. david and kirk, facing each other, are turned to stone. bones, jedda and chekov turn to look at carol, wondering. terrell very casually takes the phaser from jedda. new angle (formerly scene 134)}
<C>__{terrell}
<P>__{(cool)}
<D>__{i will hold onto this.}
<A>__{but kirk and carol ignore them and walk towards each other. there are tears in carol's eyes. she reaches up, trying to smile and touches his hair }
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{you've got a little grey }
<A>__{she can't. kirk takes her and holds her tightly, look ing at david, over her shoulder. he stands there, stunned, looking back.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{carol. is that true?}
<A>__{she nods }
<C>__{kirk}

<C>__{david}
<D>__{i knew it !}
<A>__{david makes a reckless break for terrell; saavik instantly throws herself on him bringing him down as terrell fires, hitting jedda, who was behind david a killing ray. jedda dematerializes. carol screams and david reacts with horror and guilt. most importantly, chekov begins to tremble. terrell himself is shaken by his reflexive action. he's in semi panic.}
