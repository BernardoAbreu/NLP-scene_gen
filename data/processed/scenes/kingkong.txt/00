<L>__{exterior central park day}
<A>__{close on: a scrawny monkey scratches. angles on: defeated, listless animals, in the bleak environs of a dilapidated zoo. wider: it is central park zoo in depression era new york. the park itself is like a garbage dump, dotted with squalid shanty towns. against these bleak images, the sound of a bright, brassy song fades up: al jolson, singing "i'm sitting on top of the world". the sky line of manhattan rises in the background, a grim steaming jungle on this cold fall day.}
