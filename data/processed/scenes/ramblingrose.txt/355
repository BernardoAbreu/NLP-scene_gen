<A>__{a shot of daddy in the upstairs hall. he is fully dressed and is banging angrily on rose's door.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{rose! rose! open this goddamn door! open it or i will break it down!}
<A>__{another angle on buddy as he hurries down the hall up to daddy, in khaki pants and pulling a shirt over his head.}
<C>__{daddy }
<D>__{open that door, damn you!}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{daddy, what's the matter?}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(glances around at him)}
<D>__{she's got somebody in there, brother! his shoes are on the back porch there they were, naked and smiling at me!}
<P>__{(bangs on door)}
<D>__{rose, open this door immediately!}
<A>__{another angle on daddy as he bangs on the door. we see a frightened doll in her nightgown in the b.g. down the hall, a hand to her mouth. daddy commences kicking at the door. another angle, close on daddy.}
<C>__{daddy }
<D>__{open up, rose! procrastination won't help you!}
<A>__{finally, the click of a bolt and slowly the door opens. we see a wide eyed, terrified rose. she has a sheet around her and evidently nothing more.}
<C>__{daddy }
<P>__{(he pushes past her)}
<D>__{all right, where is he? where's the culprit?}
