<L>__{ext outside the wagon that moment}
<A>__{dr. parnassus and mr nick move away from the door and go around to the front. the stage is half opened. the horses are standing steaming nearby.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<P>__{(very down)}
<D>__{i know... it's over....you've won...}
<C>__{mr nick}
<D>__{four rotten russkies?}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{and the girl..from the pub.}
<A>__{mr nick shakes his head.}
<C>__{mr nick}
<D>__{sally doesn't count. do you, gal?}
<A>__{sally (the woman thrown out from the wagon as they escaped from the pub mob) steps out of the shadows, puts her arms around nick}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{you're joking... toying with me. like a cat with a mouse... as is your privilege.}
<C>__{mr nick}
<D>__{sal didn't get to make a real choice. you were gaga. out for the count. wouldn't be fair...and you've got four, thanks to your friend tony. so... we're even... it's not quite over.}
<A>__{he smiles, lights a cigarette, takes a deep drag...}
<C>__{mr nick }
<D>__{not quite.}
<P>__{(checks his watch)}
<D>__{oh,oh, look at the time...it's 11.}
<A>__{...and he wanders off into the darkness with sally. somewhere, a clock strikes 11. dr. parnassus, agitated, watches him go.}
<C>__{valentina }
<D>__{father?}
<A>__{dr. parnassus looks round to find valentina standing next to him. he starts to round up the horses.}
<C>__{doctor parnassus}
<D>__{valentina... my darling girl. we must do another show! now! quickly! get ready to move out!}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{who was that?}
<C>__{doctor parnassus}
<D>__{somebody asking the way. where's tony?}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{i overheard you... he wasn't asking the way.}
<C>__{doctor parnassus}
<D>__{please! get everybody together. another show! tony! percy!}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{i want to know what's going on.}
<C>__{doctor parnassus}
<P>__{(harnessing the horses)}
<D>__{not now.}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{yes, now! i want to know the truth!}
<C>__{doctor parnassus}
<D>__{the truth?}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{what are you hiding?}
<C>__{doctor parnassus}
<D>__{there are more important things, at this moment!}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{it's something to do with that bloody rambling story you were telling me the night we found tony isn't it?}
<A>__{parnassus sighs. stops. he checks his watch}
<C>__{doctor parnassus}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{so tell me.}
<C>__{doctor parnassus}
<D>__{what i told you was... the truth. i really am thousands of years old. i have been immortal. i have been mortal. and i have had many dealings with the devil. too many.}
<C>__{valentina}
<P>__{(fearful)}
<D>__{what are you saying?...}
<C>__{doctor parnassus}
<D>__{remember the woman i was telling you about?.. the one i was so desperately in love with.. so in love that i made a deal with the devil? that was your mother... ...she was so beautiful, so enchanting...so...}
<A>__{looking at valentina, dr. parnassus sees her morph into the beautiful woman appearing. he almost swoons.}
<C>__{doctor parnassus }
<D>__{... so young. she was everything i had ever dreamed of. i made a choice. i bargained away my immortality. i regained my youth... and i won her. i did! i won her...!}
<A>__{the beautiful woman morphs back into valentina.}
<C>__{doctor parnassus }
<D>__{...but at a price...}
<A>__{dr. parnassus looks haggard. he closes his eyes. he sways and loses his balance. valentina stops him from falling.}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{what price?}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<P>__{(anguished)}
<D>__{it's too terrible...}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{tell me...}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{i... the price of my obsession...}
<P>__{(he groans)}
<D>__{i can't say it.}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{say it.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{you.}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{i was mortal again... on condition that... any children i fathered... would, on their sixteenth birthday... belong to him.}
<C>__{valentina}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{him?...}
<A>__{valentina can't take it in.}
<C>__{valentina }
<D>__{but... didn't...}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{your mother never knew. she died before i had to tell her.}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{i don't believe this! it can't be true. it's just another of your wretched stories... a cruel story!}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{if only...}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{why do you say these things?}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{it's true. every word. but all is not lost.}
<A>__{valentina looks at him.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus }
<P>__{(feverishly)}
<D>__{a new wager... the first of five. if i win... you're free... you're mine again.. and we can win! where's tony? we can still win!}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{by playing games with the devil!?}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{with one more show. the day isn't over.}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{valentina.}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{all my life you've made me play `beauty', `truth', `justice'... filled my head with dreams and high ideals. all that crap! while... all the time...! the devil was right! you're arrogant! vain and arrogant! i'm just another one of your stupid wagers!... you're beneath contempt.}
<A>__{she rushes off into the dark night.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{valentina! that's not true! it's not like that! wait! come back! valentina!}
<A>__{a dark silhouette stands in the shadow of the wagon. it's tony. what has he heard?}
