<L>__{exterior shakespeare bridge. day.}
<A>__{angle on a neighborhood street. we hear glen's voice and pan up to reveal nancy and glen high above, two tiny figures walking across this strange white bridge in old los angeles. camera}
<B>__{begins a slow zoom.}
<C>__{glen}
<D>__{whenever i get nervous i eat.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{and if you can't do that, you sleep.}
<C>__{glen}
<D>__{used to. not anymore.}
<A>__{glen jams more big mack into his face. by now our zoom reveals he's attacking a huge bag of big macks, and furtively eyeing nancy. the girl's hair is startlingly white in the sunlight. she's reading a book, hardly paying attention.}
<C>__{glen }
<D>__{you ever read about the balinese way of dreaming?}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{glen}
<D>__{they got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. so, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{glen}
<D>__{instead of screaming and getting nuts, you say, okay, i'm gonna make up my mind that i fall into a magic world where i can get something special, like a poem or song.}
<P>__{(grins hopefully)}
<D>__{they get all their art literature from dreams. just wake up and write it down. dreamskills.}
<A>__{he stops, seeing the look on nancy's face. our zoom is much closer now, a wide medium, and still coming in on the kids.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{and what if they meet a monster in their dream? then what?}
<C>__{glen}
<D>__{they turn their back on it.}
<P>__{(grins hopefully)}
<D>__{takes away its energy, and it disappears.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{what happens if they don't do that?}
<C>__{glen}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{i guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{great.}
<A>__{she leans over the railing, poking her face back into her book. glen tips its cover and reads its title. our zoom is still moving closer, a medium close up now.}
<C>__{glen}
<D>__{'booby traps and improvised anti personel devices'!}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{i found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on ventura.}
<C>__{glen}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{well what you reading it for?}
<A>__{our zoom locks in on a tight two on their faces, nancy's grimly determined.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{i'm into survival.}
<A>__{she walks away, out of frame, leaving glen watching after her in astonishment.}
<C>__{glen}
<D>__{she's starting to scare the living shit out of me.}
