<D>__{... i don't even remember wennerstrom working here, much less being fired ...}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{why would you. it was a long time ago. which is more to the point than the money he embezzled.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{i don't think i'm seeing the pointerior}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{yes, you are.}

<P>__{(regarding the documents)}
<D>__{i swear i didn't know this was what henrik had on him. if i had, i never would have let him bring you up here. but he wasn't trying to deceive you.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{come on, he knows you can't try somebody for this 35 years later. i like henrik, but he knows that.}
<A>__{frode disagrees }
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{a man's reputation used to mean something he still believes that. i'm sure he thought you could destroy wennerstrom with this in the court of public opinion.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{the "court of public opinion," dirch, makes celebrities out of girls who shop. henrik promised me wennerstrom's carcass on a plate. this isn't even the plate. i can't do anything with this.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{of course you're right ...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
