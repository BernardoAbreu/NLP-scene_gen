<A>__{the doors open and the crowd surges on. quail grabs a seat. at intervals throughout the car are video monitors on which a news broadcast is showing.}
<C>__{newscaster }
<D>__{ more violence today from mars's strike torn ore colonies }
<A>__{everyone ignores the broadcast except quail, who perks instantly at the word "mars." the newscaster is a young black man.}

<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{...but earth intelligence operations director vilos cohaagen, clearly worried about the damage to mars's all important tourist industry was today dismissive of the dissident groups....}
<A>__{tv scene switches to a press conference. cohaagen, sur rounded by aides, steps in front of a podium packed with news network microphones and cameras. cohaagen is a striking, intense man with an obvious air of power.}
<C>__{cohaagen}
<D>__{we're dealing with a bunch of extremists and unrepresentative lunatics. mars is a happy and prosperous protectorate of earth... and will remain so.}
<A>__{the train stops at another station and more people pile on. quail tries to watch the broadcast through the bodies passing in front of him and intermittently blocking the image.}
<C>__{reporter }
<D>__{there have been some criticisms, sir....}
<C>__{cohaagen}
<D>__{i have no further comment.}
<A>__{the news conference ends and a bright looking young man comes on the screen. quail continues to watch, though not as interested, initially, as he was by the mars story. few of the other passengers bother looking at the screen.}
<C>__{announcer}
<D>__{good morning, commuters. this portion of your trip is brought to you by rekall, inc. do you have a dream that never came true? do you aspire but only perspire? has the great adventure passed you by? then come to... rekall, where what might have been will have been. for the memories of a lifetime... rekall.}
<A>__{quail watches the commercial through to the end, but doesn't seem to take it very seriously. he glances away as a card comes on the screen with rekall's numbers.}
