<D>__{no one knew, or would ever know, that i now carried the pills with me at all times.}
<A>__{eddie stands, waiting, his two security guys lurking 10 steps behind. gennady appears, now with two russian thugs of his own. this is new, and eddie wasn't expecting it. gennady's security guys eye eddie's security guys, and vice versa. gennady is wearing a suit and looks much more sophisticated. eddie hands gennady a small envelope. gennady takes it. in his eyes is a penetrating intelligence.}
<D>__{eddie (v.0.) (cont'd) right away, it was obvious he was on mdt.}
<A>__{gennady whips out a silver lighter and lights himself a cigarette. his movements are elegant, refined.}

<D>__{next week? you can fuck yourself.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{not that you'll feel anything.}
<A>__{gennady's eyebrow goes up. gennady's security guys reach into their jackets. so do eddie's guys. gennady's eyes flick over the situation, motion to his guys to keep still. gennady laughs, an unpleasant sound.}

<A>__{gennady turns, walks to the curb, where a new black town car is waiting for him and his boys.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{obviously, this could not go on. but there is very little on this earth that 45 million dollars can't solve. and tomorrow at nine, atwood would sign the papers.}
