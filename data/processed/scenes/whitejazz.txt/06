<L>__{interior police headquarters bradley's office morning}
<A>__{spartan space appointed with high ticket items like the mahogany table around which we sit. outside: echoes of a protest filter through the windows:}
<C>__{muffled protest amalgam }
<D>__{mexican brothers si! imperial dodgers no!}
<A>__{four of us at the table glued to the t.v, watching u.s. attorney welles noonan lambasting the lapd.}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{la's version of the young turks, only meaner. me (v.o.) (cont'd) boyce bradley, chief of detectives. smartest man in town. and one of the richest: dad was a real estate developer who owned a strip of land that's now known as the santa monica freeway. on either side, bradley's book ends: d.a. bob gallaudet, not the smartest man in town: `gas chamber' bob cribbed my notes at usc law. and tom bethune, running for a city council seat that'll decide if this mexican slum called chavez ravine gets bulldozed and renamed `dodger stadium.'}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{turn it off.}
<A>__{bethune leaps like a lapdog, hits the power.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{i was pissing. he was jumping.}
<A>__{bradley picks up a newspaper:}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{`us attorney noonan is accusing the los angeles police department in general, and lt. david klein in particular, of murder at worst, gross incompetence at best...'}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{noonan had sanderline scared. after he sang to me he panicked & jumped.}
<C>__{tom bethune}
<D>__{he did spend a month in camarillo mental hospital last year }
<C>__{gas chamber bob}
<D>__{ and wearing that hotel robe over his clothes makes him look even more looney bin.}
<C>__{tom bethune}
<D>__{plus, reuben ruiz recanted. so noonan's boxing probe is dead. he's got nothing }
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{ but time, a mandate and new targets...i need to speak to the lieutenant alone.}
<A>__{bob and tom nod, pat my back on the way out: proud uncles lending support before dad drops the hammer. door closes. i stand, step to the window, big pro mex protest below: geeks and placards: `baseball is as american as the trail of tears!}
<C>__{bradley }
<D>__{describe to me your duty, as you understood it, regarding sanderline johnson and reuben ruiz.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{take both men into custody before noonan and the feds could, and find out what they were going to tell }
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{ and why did i choose you for this?}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{because i'm a cop with a law degree, and you thought my legal }
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{ because your a thug with a law degree. because i thought by now you'd be so indebted to this department for not indicting and or imprisoning you, that diligent, honest discharge of duty would be assured.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and i made a horrible misjudgment.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{bethune and gallaudet don't think so.}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{bob's happy because he wants to be state attorney general and his most likely opponent will be welles noonan. tom's happy because morton diskant, who's leading their city council race, is endorsed by noonan. thus, they're not seeing the larger play.}
<P>__{(with calculated emphasis)}
<D>__{noonan's new target will likely be the lapd itself.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{how do you know that?}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{because that's where i would aim: a subpoenaed federal witness plummets to his death in the company of two lapd detectives?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{this screams police corruption. this offers noonan the possibility of payback in the form of national headlines.}
<A>__{i wave it all off:}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{johnson did that stint at the nut house leak his file to your friends at the times }
<A>__{ and bradley drops his bomb: coroner's file. i stare...guess the contents...try to keep my heart rate in check...}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{my friends would be more interested in this.}
<P>__{(beat, flipping file open)}
<D>__{coroner's preliminary: white paint chips found embedded in sanderline johnson's scalp. a matching dent on the white window sill. i checked with the hotel switchboard and found a call was patched to your room at about the same time johnson flew out of it.}
<P>__{(beat, proclamation:)}
<D>__{it shocks and sickens me that your allegiance to the chicago mob would take precedence over the lapd.}
<C>__{me}
<P>__{(fuck drawing this out)}
<D>__{alright. where's this going?}
<P>__{(pull my badge, table it)}
<D>__{gun? shield? what?}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{the appearance of disciplinary measures taken against you are mandated post sanderline johnson, so your suspension will be recorded but sealed...and kept quiet for now }
<C>__{me}
<D>__{so if the papers or noonan come sniffing around }
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{ we can provide adequate proof of your dismissal.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{but you're not dismissing me.}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{just on paper.}
<P>__{(closes the file)}
<D>__{since i misjudged the cop i thought you were, i'm going to leverage the cop that you are.}
<A>__{bradley slides the morning paper over. front page: `candidate diskant hears the hue and cry of the underclass...' the photo shows a smiling diskant, rolled shirt sleeves, in the middle of a sea of la immigrants, all smiling back.}
<C>__{bradley }
<D>__{morton diskant is to be removed from the city council race. the means and methods implemented to that end i will entrust to you.}
<C>__{me}
<P>__{(throw a thumb at bethune)}
<D>__{you want me to torpedo diskant so your buddy bethune can win a city council seat uncontested }
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{ or spend the next month in lock up before being arraigned on charges of gross misconduct and dereliction of duty. the preamble before you face life in prison for murder.}
<A>__{i stare back. feel myself getting fitted for strings...}
<C>__{bradley }
<D>__{diskant works saturdays. late.}
<A>__{bradley waves me out. i intentionally drag my badge back across the desk, scratching his mahogany heirloom.}
