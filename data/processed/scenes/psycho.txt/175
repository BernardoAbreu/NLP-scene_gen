<A>__{lila is on the top step, looking down toward camera. she is listening, hoping to hear some human sound, some sound she might follow, pursue. she hears nothing. she starts down the stairs. just below the halfway step, she looks at the front door, sees out through the door window: lila's viewpoint (day) norman coming.}
<L>__{interior stairway of the old house (day)}
<A>__{for a moment lila panics, then she hurries down the steps, cannot go in the direction of the front door, remembers the stairway behind her, turns and runs in that direction. the sound of norman bounding up the porch steps can be heard. lila turns and dashes down the stairs which lead to the basement, going down far enough to conceal herself, crouching there. norman enters the hallway, closes the door softly, listens. he glances once in the direction of the basement stairs. he seems about to smile, when suddenly all expression vanishes from his face, and he appears to enter a no place, no time state. he crosses to the stairway, goes up. lila remains crouched on the basement stairs, listening to the sounds of norman. his footsteps on the stairs followed by the fast noises of doors opening, of fast moving about an upstairs room. convinced that he is searching the upstairs for her, she decides to chance an escape. she starts up the steps, is about to turn into the hallway when her eye is caught by a glimmer of light down in the basement. she pauses, looks down, sees the crack of light coming from behind the not entirely closed door to the fruit cellar. the swift moving sounds of norman continue to come from upstairs. lila is torn, knows she should get out of the house while she has the chance, is unable to resist the impulse to check that hidden looking room down below, a room in which, she desperately believes, there must lie some answer to what happened to mary. she turns and goes softly and quickly down the stairs.}
