<D>__{i think i figured it out. remember when i went out with that notary public? and he cheated on me? and then anastasia from upstairs told us that story about how her boyfriend cheated on her at the beginning but then he totally changed and they're married and crazy in love.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i thought that guy was a process server.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{no, notary. anyway, the point is anastasia is the exception. not the rule. we have to stop listening to these stories because the rule is that most guys who cheat on you up front don't really care about you very much.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{okay...}
<A>__{gigi consults her crumpled pieces of paper.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{exhibit a: chad, the drummer who lived in his storage space. he only used me for rides, yet i continued to stalk him for most of 1998. then there was don, who broke up with me every friday so he could have his weekends free. i was so delusional about our relationship that i referred to him as my husband to random people like my dental hygenist.}
<C>__{gigi }
<D>__{and all my friends would tell me stories about how things might work out with these dipshits because they knew someone who knew someone who dated a dipshit just like mine, and that girl ended up getting married and living happily ever after. but that's the exception. and we're not the exception we're the rule.}
<A>__{gigi sits down, spent. but beth has been listening.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{ok. so let me see if i understand. what you're saying is that when people tell me about some girl they know who dated a guy for thirteen years, and then he finally married her that's the exception. and the rule is that guys like neil who are with girls like me for seven years without getting married are never getting married.}
<A>__{beth is serious. gigi freezes, tries to backtrack.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{no. no, no, no. that's not what i'm saying. this has absolutely nothing to do with you. i was just talking, you know, about me. specifically.}
<A>__{off beth, knowing it's about her, too.}
