<D>__{but what, exactly, is stagflation, this mixture of inflation and stagnation, and how should we in the securities industry understand and accommodate it? well and i hope i'm not out of bounds here think of the money supply as a large male organ, continuously inflating, and yet, the societal vaginal cavity simply wants more. as the vicious circle of higher returns without real satisfaction continues, the money organ may seem to be in demand, but in fact even the most inflated capital is unwanted. this is why i suggest that while we engage this mawing abyss for the highest returns, we at the same time fantasize, so to speak, of the safe harbor of capital appreciation.}
