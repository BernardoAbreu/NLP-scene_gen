<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{we see a few quick shots of wes securing a line down into the crevice, epps and jaeger clipping on rapeling harnesses, the two men lowering themselves down into the great unknown.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior crevices continuous}
<A>__{the lantern punches a hole through the darkness as epps uses it like a machete to blaze a trial. he sinks down...down until finally they touch bottom. he unclips himself from the rope and jaeger starts down. the space isn't that big, like a small cave really. it's tight enough that the lantern pretty well lights up the whole of it. but it's big enough that one wouldn't have any idea where to start digging. jaeger makes it to the bottom. wes yells down.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{you down?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{yeah, we're down.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{what do you see?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{more to himself:}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{a whole lot of nothing.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{so where do we start?}
<A>__{epps takes a look around, then shrugs.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{wherever you want.}
<A>__{epps breaks out his utility shovel from his pack. jaeger follows suit. he looks around, picks a spot and starts digging.}
