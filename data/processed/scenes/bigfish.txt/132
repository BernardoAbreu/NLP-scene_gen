<D>__{after four months, sandra had gotten over the worst of the nightmares. when the phone rang, she didn't think it was somehow me calling her. when a car drove past, she didn't get up to check out the window.}
<A>__{pulling a dress out of the basket, sandra looks up to see a man's silhouette on the sheet in front of her. she freezes, watching the shadow ripple across the white fabric, blowing so softly in the breeze. she knows it can't be him. he's dead. she turns away. with all the strength she can gather, she hangs up that dress and digs another one out of the basket. looking up, she sees not a shadow but edward himself standing before her. she gasps, disbelieving, but his hand is real. it is destiny. without another moment's hesitation, she kisses him.}
