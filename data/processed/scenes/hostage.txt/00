<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{exterior a hyperblue los angeles sky day}
<A>__{the sky is overlaid with the slow whup whup whup of an lapd helicopter flashing through the frame, here and gone. lapd radio transmissions crackle like static electricity around a dirty clapboard bungalow that looks like the puckered asshole of eagle rock. a man's terrified voice screams invisibly from the house }
<C>__{malik's voice}
<D>__{i'm gonna kill this dog! you make my wife talk to me or i'm gonna shoot this fuckin' dog!}
<A>__{a five member swat tactical team appears out of nowhere full black assault gear, m5s, gloved and masked hustling into position on either side of the front door. only now do we get the full picture: helicopters overhead, radio cars surrounding the house, an army of cops itching the pull the trigger when the tac team is good to go, the team leader gives a thumbs up to }
<B>__{sergeant jeff talley and lt. murray leifitz}
<A>__{talley and leifitz are hunkered behind the lapd command and control van. leifitz is the crisis response team swat commander; talley, the primary negotiator. it's so hot out here that talley has stripped down to a tee shirt and vest.}
<C>__{leifitz}
<D>__{they're good to go, talley. your word, and we're in the house.}
<C>__{talley}
<D>__{no one's going anywhere, l t. we can talk this guy down.}
<A>__{talley lifts a dedicated crisis phone that's been hardlined into the house, his tone reasonable and friendly }
<C>__{talley }
<P>__{(into the phone)}
<D>__{hey, george? george, don't kill the dog, okay? we don't want to hear a gun go off in there.}
<A>__{a phone crashes through the window and lands in the front yard }
<C>__{malik's voice}
<P>__{(screaming from the house)}
<D>__{fuck you!}
<C>__{leifitz}
<D>__{i don't think he wants to talk.}
<A>__{frustrated, talley slumps back against the van as the swat intelligence officer, lloyd keith, scuttles up to them }
<C>__{talley}
<D>__{where's the guy's wife?}
<C>__{keith}
<D>__{she didn't take the kid to her sister's. the neighbors were wrong.}
<C>__{talley}
<D>__{goddamnit, you said we had her. i told him we had her!}
<C>__{keith}
<D>__{we got bad information, talley. i can't pull her out of my ass!}
<A>__{up at the house, george edward malik steps into the window. malik is a forty year old freaked out loser who has turned the corner on insanity }
<C>__{malik}
<P>__{(shouting at talley)}
<D>__{you said my wife was gonna talk to me, you lying fuck! i'm gonna kill her dog, then shoot myself! i mean it!}
<A>__{talley stares at malik, thinking, then abruptly grabs keith by the collar }
<C>__{talley}
<P>__{(to keith)}
<D>__{pull the dog's name out of your ass. get the dog's name.}
<A>__{talley steps out from behind the command van so that malik can see him.}
<C>__{leifitz}
<P>__{(alarmed by talley's move)}
<D>__{talley! you're in the line of fire!}
<A>__{talley ignores leifitz; he is totally focused on malik and on defusing the situation }
<C>__{talley}
<D>__{i didn't lie to you, george. you scared your wife pretty good last night. we're having a hard time finding her.}
<C>__{malik}
<D>__{she better talk to me! i'm gonna kill her goddamned dog!}
<C>__{talley}
<D>__{you and i have been talking for, what, sixteen hours? keep talking. is that your dog, too?}
<A>__{malik steps away from the window }
<C>__{malik's voice}
<D>__{i don't know whose dog it is. she lied about everything else, so she probably lied about the dog.}
<C>__{talley}
<D>__{i know you're hurting. you lose your job, you find out your wife's fucking another guy . . . but don't give up. we'll have her talk to you.}
<C>__{malik's voice}
<D>__{then why won't she open her mouth?! why doesn't the bitch say something???}
<A>__{something about malik's statement bothers talley. the wording is odd, suspicious }
<C>__{talley}
<D>__{george? come back to the window.}
<C>__{malik's voice}
<D>__{stop looking at me!!!}
<A>__{talley grows even more concerned. was malik talking to him?}

<D>__{george? leave the dog alone and come to the window.}
<A>__{talley sees keith rejoin leifitz }
<C>__{talley }

<D>__{what's the dog's name?}
<C>__{leifitz}
<D>__{the neighbors say he doesn't have a dog.}
<A>__{the pieces fall into place for talley: the wife that no one can find, the dog that doesn't exist....}
<C>__{malik's voice}
<D>__{open your goddamned mouth or i'm gonna shoot this dog!}
<A>__{in a single terrible moment, talley realizes that malik is not talking to him; he's talking to his wife }
<C>__{talley}
<D>__{murray!! they're in the house! his wife's in the house!}
<A>__{even as talley screams, a gunshot echoes from the house, freezing the moment. a second shot follows the first as the tactical team breaches the front door talley sprints forward, running as hard as he can in nightmare slow motion }
