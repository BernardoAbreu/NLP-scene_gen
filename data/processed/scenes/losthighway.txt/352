<A>__{fred, still fully dressed, is waking up, as if in a trance the same attitude he had on the videotape. he strains upwards and looks eerily around the room. he gets up and crosses slowly to a window. he takes the edge of the window curtain and pulls it back. the view is of the gravel parking lot of the hotel. fred's pov: he sees renee, down below, walk over to a car, get in and drive away. fred walks back to his bed, picks up his revolver from under the pillow, crosses the room to the door and walks out.}
