<L>__{interior living room}
<C>__{funkhauser}
<D>__{you'll have to pardon my bursting in at this dreary hour }
<P>__{(puts a sketch on a chair)}
<D>__{ practically the middle of the night }
<P>__{(puts wallpaper against mantel)}
<D>__{ but i did so want to catch you in. i've been at it hammer and tongs all week and i'm just a mess }
<P>__{(drapes bolt of chintz}
<D>__{over high backed}
<P>__{chair)}
<D>__{ but then muriel and i thought we ought to talk it over with you before we take the plunge...}
<A>__{funkhauser looks briefly for a high object over which to display his last bolt of chintz, finds none, settles for jim's shoulder over which he drapes the cloth, the folds flowing down in front. as jim reacts:}
<C>__{funkhauser}
<P>__{(smoothing out folds on the chintz)}
<D>__{after all, it's your home, too, and it should reflect you. you know, man's castle, all that sort of thing.}
<A>__{jim looks down at the chintz.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(ominously)}
<D>__{muriel!}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{jim, just wait till you hear. he's got some wonderful ideas for the foyer.}
<C>__{funkhauser}
<D>__{oh, that's out! all out! changed the whole thing! i just couldn't live with it! i said to myself, "bunny, what are the blandings? how shall we do them?" and the answer was perfectly obvious. very american, very grass roots, very blueberry pie that sort of thing.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(dark look at muriel)}
<D>__{mm.}
<A>__{funkhauser fingers the material of a drape, disdainfully removes his hand.}
<C>__{funkhauser}
<D>__{now first, let's dig into this living room of yours, it's really a dreary.}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(quickly; to jim)}
<D>__{we want this room to be very gay, dear. something in bright reds, yellows and greens.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(appalled)}
<D>__{red, yellow and green?!}
<C>__{funkhauser}
<D>__{oh, come, mr. blandings, let's not run away from color.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{not running away }
<P>__{(a lame joke)}
<D>__{ just backing off a little.}
<C>__{funkhauser}
<D>__{uh yes.}
<P>__{(brightly)}
<D>__{now as i see our room, it's definitely colonial. you know, cobbler's bench, breakfront, pie cooler, student lamp, hooked rug. but everything in good taste. it must not jump out at you and scream: "look see how antique i am!"}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{heaven forbid.}
<C>__{funkhauser}
<D>__{of course, these things take imagination. you've simply got to be able to visualize.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(politely, removing chintz)}
<D>__{if you'll forgive me, mr. funkhauser, what i'd like to visualize at this dreary hour is how much is this all going to cost?}
<C>__{funkhauser}
<D>__{well, really, i hesitate to say. after all }
<P>__{(indicates)}
<D>__{ by the time this wall is out we may find }
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(reacting)}
<D>__{this wall is what?}
<C>__{funkhauser}
<D>__{out. source of light is from the east. obviously if our room is to have any function at all }
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you're going to tear out the wall?!}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{dear, it's a wonderful notion.}
<C>__{funkhauser}
<D>__{visualize three feet of leaded panes, the rest }
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{can you give me a figure?}
<C>__{funkhauser}
<D>__{well! costs aren't what they used to be, you know, and }
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{just a figure.}
<C>__{funkhauser}
<D>__{materials are impossible, labor has just run wild }
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{just an overall figure.}
<C>__{funkhauser}
<D>__{well!... i shouldn't like to be tied down. but i suppose if you must have a figure, i'd say mm }
<P>__{(lightly)}
<D>__{ somewhere in the neighborhood of seven.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{mm... seven.}
<C>__{funkhauser}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{mm.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{that would be seven... thousand?}
<C>__{funkhauser}
<D>__{mm.}
<A>__{jim looks at muriel, considers.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(soberly)}
<D>__{we ll. that seems fair.}
<P>__{(gathering up materials)}
<D>__{after all, we're not running away from color }
<P>__{(picks up wallpaper)}
<D>__{ and we are tearing out walls }
<P>__{(picks up sketches)}
<D>__{mr. funkhauser, do you have a card?}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{jim, we haven't even discussed the rest of the house.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{we will, dear.}
<P>__{(leads the whole batch on funkhauser)}
<C>__{funkhauser}
<P>__{(huffy)}
<D>__{well, really, i }
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(deftly steering him toward the door)}
<D>__{we'll talk it all out and then we'll get in touch with bunny.}
<A>__{camera trucks with them to the door.}
<C>__{funkhauser}
<D>__{well, really, i mean, i was under the impression we'd come to some decision today.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i'm sure we will.}
<C>__{funkhauser}
<D>__{we ll!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{so nice of you to come.}
<P>__{(puts funkhauser's hat on his head)}
<D>__{good day.}
<A>__{and funkhauser is gone. jim closes the door, turns ominously.}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(apprehensively)}
<D>__{now darling, you you just don't go to a man like funkhauser and ask how much it's going to cost before you even know what he's going to do!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{no, that would be too logical! seven thousand dollars! blueberry pie! i wouldn't put seventy five cents into this broken down rat trap!}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(sentimentally)}
<D>__{it's our home, jim. betsy was practically born in this apartment.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{that does not make it a national shrine!}
<P>__{(vehemently)}
<D>__{seven thousand dollars and not one word about closets.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{closets! you wouldn't even let him get to the bathroom!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i haven't got that kind of money!}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{the way you talk, jim blandings, you'd think i was some kind of congenital idiot!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{sometimes i'm beginning to wonder!}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(furious)}
<D>__{you can just get out of here!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{that's not a bad idea!}
<A>__{he angrily jerks open the hall closet door, pulls his hat down from the shelf, several hat boxes, some ski boots and a tennis racket tumbling down on his head. jim jams his hat onto his head, takes a deep breath and storms out, slamming the door. muriel walks over to the closet, is about to bend down and pick up a hatbox when all of her pent up emotions explode. she kicks the hat box into the closet, slams the door, starts to cry.}
