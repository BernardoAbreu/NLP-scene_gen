<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior bastille night}
<A>__{d'artagnan lands with a thud at richelieu's feet. rochefort hisses:}
<C>__{rochefort}
<D>__{on your knees.}
<A>__{when d'artagnan fails to respond, rochefort gives him a mighty kick. d'artagnan scrambles into the correct posture of supplication. rochefort continues:}
<C>__{rochefort}
<D>__{this is the boy who killed jussac.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i can explain that }
<C>__{rochefort}
<D>__{silence!}
<A>__{rochefort punches d'artagnan in the head, knocking him to the floor. the cardinal frowns.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{rochefort. violence solves nothing. leave him to me.}
<A>__{d'artagnan reacts to the cardinal's reasonable tone. rochefort makes a sullen exit. the cardinal smiles.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{please. sit down.}
<A>__{d'artagnan reacts with perceptible awe, as if seeing his first movie star. he sits in a finely brocaded chair, looks at the cardinal, an apparition in red. the cardinal speaks, his manner casual, friendly.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{how much did you hear?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<P>__{(busted)}
<D>__{not a word, your eminence. i stepped from my cell for a breath of air, and became lost in the corridors, it's dark as you know, but then i saw a light up ahead, the light over your door, i...}
<A>__{richelieu smiles, dismisses d'artagnan's tale with a wave of his hand.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{you may have many talents, my young friend. but guile is not one of them. do you have a name?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{d'artagnan.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{i've heard that name before. are you a gascon?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{yes, your eminence.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{tell me. what brought you to paris. and don't say 'a horse.'}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i came to join the king's musketeers.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{bad timing.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{so i've heard.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{d'artagnan, i like you. i could use a capable young man like you in my guards.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i'm honored, your eminence, but i don't think i would be very popular with the other men. not after today.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{i suppose not. your heart is set on being a musketeer.}
<P>__{(off his look)}
<D>__{when i was your age, i too had dreams of joining the musketeers.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{you, your eminence?}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{why not? becoming a musketeer is the fantasy of every young frenchman. or should i say it was...}
<P>__{(with seeming kindness, reason)}
<D>__{like the knights of the round table, the musketeers have outlived their usefulness. they are a thing of the past.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and so have your three friends. tell me where they are, d'artagnan, and i will spare your life.}
<A>__{richelieu's seeming kindness conceals a heart of ice. d'artagnan sees it now, replies quietly. no longer in awe, but in opposition.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i'm sorry. but i can't tell you what i do not know.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{in that case, give my regards to the headsman.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{what about my trial?}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{you've just had it.}
<A>__{richelieu turns for the door, means to dismiss him. d'artagnan calls after.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{wait }
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{why? do you object to losing your head?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{yes. i like it where it is.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{then tell me what i want to know, and perhaps you will keep it there a few years longer.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{where are the three musketeers?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{and if you did?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{i wouldn't tell you.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{i admire your courage, young man. you might have made a fine musketeer after all.}
<A>__{richelieu opens the door. rochefort waits on the other side.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{but we'll never know, will we?}
<A>__{rochefort steps into the room, grabs d'artagnan roughly by the arm, hurls him from the chair to the floor. this time richelieu does not utter protest. instead, he turns to the captain, commands:}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{find the three musketeers and kill them.}
<C>__{rochefort}
<D>__{they'll be dead by dawn.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{a comforting thought. good night, d'artagnan. enjoy it. morning comes quickly.}
<A>__{with that, cardinal richelieu sweeps into the dark. hold on d'artagnan for a beat. history's pawn.}
