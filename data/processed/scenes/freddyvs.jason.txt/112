<L>__{exterior camp crystal lake night}
<A>__{meagan sits on the end of the pier, watching silently as erwin sews jesse's heart into jason's chest using dental floss. stormie comes up behind her and puts her jacket around meagan's shoulders, sits down beside her and says:}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{you've got to quit blaming your self for what happened to jesse... it wasn't your fault.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{he didn't want to come with us... but he did anyway. he did it for me.}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{i'm not sorry i came... i don't think jesse would be, either.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{i just can't believe he's dead. i keep thinking he'll show up any minute...}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{well, that just about does it...}
<A>__{erwin finishes sewing up jason and climbs back onto the pier, cutting the diving platform free. he kicks it off and it floats out into the lake, drifting free. then erwin herds the girls down the shore, leading them over to where a short trench has been dug leading from the water's edge. in the bottom of the trench an uncovered power cable.}
<C>__{erwin}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{as you can see, i've excavated the power cable that runs across the bottom of crystal lake. i've cut away the insulation, exposing a patch of cable right near the water's edge.}
<A>__{erwin picks up a nearby bucket of water and sets it at the head of the trench.}
<C>__{erwin}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{now when i kick this over, the water will wash down the trench and bridge an eletrical gap between the cable and the lake. there's plenty of voltage, so it should work.}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{so you kick the bucket and jason lives.}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{yeah, right...}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{okay, keep your fingers crossed...}
<A>__{erwin kicks the bucket over. the water washes down the trench, over the cable, and pow! z z z zap! a huge spark hits explodes. then the lake begins to glow and the water begins to churn. erwin and the girls jump back as electricity arcs from the lake, engulfing the diving platform. the arcs of electricity leap from the chicken wire onto jason's body, his massive frame convulsing. close on hockey mask as we push in the electricity spirals down into the eye hole like water running down a drain. close on jason's eye as it opens! we dive into the eye and take a fantastic dream time travel to...}
