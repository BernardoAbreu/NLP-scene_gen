<A>__{at the back of the van, the agents fling open the rear doors, revealing a dozen frightened mexicans, hopeful immigrants without official permission. agent janus looks at the driver, who's now held by two other agents, and shakes his head.}

<C>__{kay }
<D>__{ah, shit.}
<A>__{agent janus screams. mikey rips free of the rest of the "mexican" disguise, knocks dee out of the way, and takes off straight at janus, screeching a horrible space bastard screech. janus freezes, terrified.}
<C>__{kay }

<C>__{kay }
<D>__{dee, for christ's }
<A>__{mikey keeps moving, covering the last few yards to janus quickly. he steps on a rock, launches himself into the air, his dripping jaws cranked wide open there is a sizzling sound, a brilliant white flash and mikey erupts in a geyser of blue goo that splatters all over the ground, the trees, and agent janus' face. behind where mikey was, kay stands, smoking weapon in hand.}

<A>__{on the road, the ins agents pull their guns and run toward the rise.}

<D>__{okay, everybody, situation's under control, calm down. if you'll just give me your attention for a moment i will tell you what happened.}
<A>__{from over the rise, car engines whine in the distance and headlights start to flash around them. kay reaches into his pocket and pulls out a tubular metallic device the size of a pocket recorder. he checks his watch, figures in his head, then dials an electronic counter on the side of the device up to "08."}
<C>__{kay }
<D>__{this is called a "neuralyzer." a gift from some friends from out of town. the red eye here isolates and measures the electronic impulses in your brain. more specifically, the ones for memory.}

<D>__{who are you, really?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{really? i'm just a figment of your imagination.}
<A>__{he holds up the neuralyzer. the agents peer closely at it. kay reaches into his pocket, puts on his own black sunglasses and pushes a button on the side of the neuralyzer. a blinding flash a tenth of a second long sears the agents' eyeballs. they stare blankly.}
<C>__{kay }
<D>__{god, we're a gullible breed.}
<A>__{behind him, tongues of fire blast from a flame thrower held by one of the men in black. kay looks back at the ins agents, who are just coming around, as if awakening from a concussion.}

<A>__{the agents look around, confused.}
<C>__{agent janus}

<L>__{interior leshko's diner day}
<A>__{rosenberg comes into the tiny restaurant, squinting in the relative darkness. at a table in the middle, he sees a man eating alone an enormous, dignified, yet profoundly strange looking man in his mid fifties. rosenberg walks carefully over to the table, but does not sit down. the man (an arquillian, and if we're eagle eyed, we recognize him as the alien on a "diplomatic mission" from passport control) rises from his chair. he steps forward, to face rosenberg, who sets the ornate box on the table. immediately, rosenberg's cat jumps on top of it. rosenberg and the arquillian stare at each other for a long moment and then embrace each other. the embrace has an odd, formal quality to it, like mafiosi coming to a sitdown. they hold on, long and hard, and both seemed choked with emotion. finally, they break apart and take their seats. they speak in a bizarre alien tongue, which is subtitled. rosenberg wipes away tears.}
