<L>__{int "d" lab timeless}
<A>__{...a laboratory that looks like the cockpit of a concorde... only a hundred times larger.. nothing is, recognizable, except desks that hold futuristic ibokin computers. a befuddling array of buttons, switches, stuttering lights, covers every inch of wall space. and at the center of it all stands a tall, cylindrical tank, a stasis tube, filled with ice. it's mounted on a six foot tall platform, like an altar, with cables and flexible tubes running out of it. wesker squints, and through the freeze, sees the thing that stands sedated within the cylinder... ...the tyrant. it's nine feet tall. like the hunters, it has more or less human form, though it's musculature is more defined than superman's. one of its arms is scaled to size, but the other is much longer. its hand dangles at knee level. monstrous steel claws depend from its fingers, nearly touching the floor.}
<C>__{wesker}
<P>__{(in awe) it's called... the tyrant.}
<D>__{nobody knows it exists. except us... and holden.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{holden?}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{umbrella's man in d.c. we need him. he signs the checks. (excited) we've got it, barry! our fortune!}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{you're not gonna try to get this big mother outta here ?}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{don't have to. all we need is the data. then.. .these things can be cranked out on an assembly line!}
<A>__{laying down his automatic, wesker hits computer keys until a disk pops out of a master feed.}
<C>__{wesker }
<D>__{yes! this is it!}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{what about the antidote?}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{antidote? (laughing) there is no antidote. that was just happy horse shit, to keep the team going.}
<A>__{neither man notices... that the removal of the master disk has caused certain systems to fail... indicated by red lights, and by the fact that... the walls of the tyrant's cylinder are beginning to run liquid sweat. the ice... is melting.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{you're gonna give this to umbrella?}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{no. i'm gonna sell it to them. then i'm gonna open a swiss bank account... right next to yours.}
<C>__{jill }
<D>__{god...damn!}
<A>__{jill has appeared in the doorway with chris. they both at the monster with awe...and terror.}
<C>__{jill }
<D>__{that thing... can't be real!}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{it's real, alright. and it's worth... more than gold. more than uranium!}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{do we get a piece of that action?}
<A>__{rosie has arrived. so have rebecca, ada, and the two surviving scientists.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{all of you do. anyone who comes out of this alive... gets a taste.}
<C>__{rodriguez }
<D>__{i'm in. i been eatin' shit all my life. i'm happy to eat some more... as long as it's got some gravy on it.}
<A>__{rosie steps into the lab, her weapon ready.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{anybody else see it my way?}
<A>__{one of the scientists, toshiro, rushes to join.}
<C>__{ada}
<P>__{(to toshiro) you disgrace yourself!}
<C>__{toshiro}
<D>__{i...i want to live.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{smart. anyone else? valentine?}
<A>__{jill looks at chris. then she steps through the doorway and takes a defensive post beside her c.o.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{and i was gonna try to disarm the bomb. this place should be destroyed! it needs to be destroyed!}
<A>__{chris lifts his rifle. wesker is faster with his pistol, aiming it at chris' belly.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{gotcha, son. it's only because of valentine, here, that i didn't squeeze the trigger.}
<A>__{chris and jill exchange dagger eyes.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{if she's on your side... she doesn't mean shit to me. and i don't mean shit to her.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{chris, please. there's only... one way to go, here .}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{that's right. my way!}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{yes, sir. your way!}
<A>__{jill presses in close to wesker, as if completely allied.}
<C>__{jill }
<D>__{i...can't yell you, chris...how much i wanted...things to have turned out differently. (beat) goodbye.}
<A>__{swiftly, unexpectedly, jill snatches the detonator wire and pulls the sensor out of wesker's ear. everyone shuts their eyes, expecting to be blown sky high. nothing happens. jill pulls the detonator off wesker's belt. she stares small led screen which reads... 14:42:16... 15... 14...}
<C>__{jill }
<D>__{shit. i got all my courage up... and we still have fifteen minutes!}
<A>__{jill tosses the detonator to chris. wesker turns on her, lifting his m 16...}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{you shoot. i shoot, boss.}
<A>__{wesker turns to find barry's weapon aiming at his belly.}
<C>__{barry }
<D>__{shit.. here i am still callin' you 'boss'.}
<A>__{wesker is holding the data disk. suddenly, he feels it snatched away...by ada, who has rushed into the room. he aims his weapon at her back as she darts away. before he can fire, he's kicked in the head... by jill. buckling, dazed, he looks up at her.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{we believed in you. i believed in you. boy, was i a sucker.}
<A>__{she kicks him again, just for the hell of it. he flops on the floor, his eye socket swollen. he's dropped his gun. he gropes for it. barry steps in and boots it away. a klaxon sounds! emergency! the ice in the tyrant's tank has melted down to a critical level. the monster... is beginning to move. reaching the doorway, ada hears a mechanism trip in the jamb. the plexiglas doors begin to slide shut. ada strains to hold them back.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{get out! now! or you never will!}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{so... we'll live here! (glancing at the tyrant) no. the landlord looks like a sonuvabitch.}
<A>__{rosie rushes in to help ada hold the doors. so does benjamin, the second of the surviving scientists, who is... ...mauled from behind by a zombie. it's not just any zombie. it's brad vickers, back from death, who bites out the artery in benjamin's neck.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{i told you... to shoot him!}
<A>__{ada lifts her .45 and blows vickers way. she looks down at benjamin, writhing on the floor, aims at his head... and fires again. rodriguez is the only one holding the doors. jill rushes to help her.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{everybody! out!}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(off the led) thirteen minutes.}
<A>__{inside the lab, barry turns to toshiro, the other scientist.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{go.}
<A>__{toshiro hesitates... a second too long. kraaasssh! the stasis tube bursts open. water and bits of ice fly out... along with an enormous, bionic hand. big enough to grab toshiro's head as if it were a cantaloupe. powerful enough to crush that head as if it were... well, a cantaloupe. wesker, still searching for his pistol, sees all this. the tyrant is not completely free. much of the cylinder wall has cracked away, but sections of it cling to a now misshapen mass of ice that still holds the monster bound. though it won1t for much longer. wesker starts toward the door. barry grabs the back of his shirt and pitches him across the lab.}
<C>__{barry }
<D>__{you and me... we ain't goin' nowhere. not just now, boss.}
<A>__{barry turns to the others clustered at the doorway.}
<C>__{barry }
<D>__{this thing gets loose, it's gonna be pissed. somebody's gotta hold it back. give you guys a fair chance.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{look out!}
<A>__{wesker has found his pistol. he fires at barry who, ducking, is only grazed. wesker aims at the group in the doorway. barry pops out from behind a desk and shoots back at him. ada and rebecca duck away from the doors, pulling rodriguez and a reluctant jill after them. the doors begin to slide closed. chris valiantly tries to prevent them from shutting. wesker crawls lke a dog. he manages to fling an arm out through the opening. steel bumpers press on the meat of his forearm. wesker looks up. through the plexiglas, his eyes meet chris'.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{get me outta here, redfield. or so help me god, you're a dead man.}
<A>__{with his free hand, wesker aims his pistol at chris. the gun barrel is an intimidating sight, even though it's on the other side of the plexi. chris glances at the others.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{get going.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{not without...}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{move!}
<A>__{ada, rebecca and rodriguez wrestle jill away bodily, and start up the metal stairway.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{come back! rodriguez! valentine! that's an order !}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{orders don't mean shit any more, wesker. especially when they come from sell out bastards like you.}
<A>__{chris lets go. the doors squeeze tighter. wesker screams. through the plexi, chris catches a glimpse of barry, who stands and gives him a military salute. chris salutes back. blam blam blam... wesker fires three rounds. dusty blemishes appear on the bulletproof glass. the slugs ricochet back into the lab. one of them chips away at the ice which is less and less able to contain the tyrant. chris makes a break for the stairs. wesker twists his body in an attempt to push his pistol through the opening, but his fist, around the stock, is too thick. nonetheless, wesker fires .blam blam blam... bullets scream off the banister rails, but none of them contact chris' legs which disappear up the stairs. the ice in the stasis tube is turning to slush. the tyrant is about to break loose. wesker looks pleadingly at barry.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{b buddy. you gotta get us out.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{not sure i know how, boss. do you? is there some other...'need to know' secret for shutting down the big bopper, here?}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{no. it.. it can't be shut down.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{the ultimate warrior. the ultimate soldier. we'll see. how it does against a couple of hard ass career guys, like you and me.}
<A>__{wesker swings his free arm and aims his pistol at barry. click! the gun is empty.}
