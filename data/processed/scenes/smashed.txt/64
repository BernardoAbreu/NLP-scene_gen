<A>__{kate and charlie wander around santa's village an abandoned christmas themed amusement park (with giant ginger bread houses, plastic christmas trees, etc.) in the middle of the woods. creepy and nostalgic at the same time. looks like the set of a christmas horror film. kate holds charlie's hand as she leads him around.}
