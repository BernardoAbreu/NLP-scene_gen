<L>__{interior trains station bar day}
<A>__{carol sits in the bar. a young soldier approaches and sits down at the counter next to her. she is finishing a vodka gimlet.}
<C>__{soldier}
<P>__{(to a bartender)}
<D>__{beer.}
<A>__{carol glances at her watch.}
<C>__{soldier }
<P>__{(continuing begins with the obvious)}
<D>__{guess you have to catch a train?}
<C>__{the soldier}
<D>__{pink cheeked and freckle faced, he has to shave maybe twice a week; twenty one years old, not good looking (his best feature is his gentle, easy grin) and not a hustler. he just wats to meet a girl.}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(not too patronizing)}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{me, too. got twenty four days of furlough and i'm goin' home.}
<A>__{the soldier's beer arrives.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{where's home?}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{utah, the bee hive state. i'm from orem, right near salt lake ... say, you wouldn't happen to be a mormon, would you?}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(chuckles)}
<D>__{no, i'm not.}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{me, neither. there's about twelve people in the state that aren't mormons and i'm one of them.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{that certainly makes you kind of special...}
<C>__{soldier}
<P>__{(awkward)}
<D>__{yeah... i guess it does.}
<A>__{carol pushes aside her glass.}
<C>__{soldier }
<P>__{(c ont inuing)}
<D>__{you wouldn't be taking the train to salt lake, would you?}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(smiles across to him)}
<D>__{no, i'm afraid not.}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{i never have any luck.}
<A>__{carol smiles at the soldier. her features suddenly freeze as she glances toward the entrance to the bar.}
<B>__{at the doorway}
<A>__{doc stands looking at carol and the soldier.}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(stands and pauses for a moment)}
<D>__{i really hope you have a nice trip.}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{thanks. i hope yours is okay, too.}
<A>__{carol moves towards the exit. the soldier quietly sips his beer, his face a bit grim.}
<B>__{at the doorway carol stops near doc.}
<A>__{they look at each other...}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{where's the suitcase?}
<A>__{carol continues looking at doc for a moment. then, suddenly moves past him, leading him out into the main lobby.}
<B>__{back within the promenade series of angles}
<A>__{carol emerges from the cocktail lounge followed by doc. they cross to the lockers. she retrieves the key from her purse and thrusts it into the proper slot. it doesn't turn. puzzled she tries again, then forcing the key, shakes the lock violently. her eyes widening into a quiet panic, she next looks at the locker number and then the number on the key. her features are now totally ashen. she walks up the bank of lockers... puts the key in another locker, the door opens, the compartment is empty. carol turns away from the locker, eyes glazed with fear... doc at her shoulder.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{a man helped me open it...}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(deceptive calm)}
<D>__{and switched keys.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{he must have.}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{it isn't another boyfriend, is it?}
<A>__{carol winces, containing her anger.}
<C>__{doc }
<P>__{(continuing icily)}
<D>__{how long ago.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{fifteen minutes.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{sure?}
<A>__{carol nods.}
<C>__{doc }
<P>__{(continuing with quick calculation)}
<D>__{he'd figure you for longer, enough time to try another hit. he's probably still in the station.}
<A>__{as doc pushes carol forward.}
<C>__{doc }
<P>__{(continuing lashing out)}
<D>__{there better be a guy with the}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(lashing back)}
<D>__{you bastard...}
<A>__{walking at a rapid pace, they start through the station, doc forcing their speed, clutching carol under her elbow. they reach the main concourse after moving down the length of the promenade... eyes straining. carol stops suddenly. she stares down the long corridor her eyes finding the thief. he stands near another bank of lockers, the black suitcase at his feet. the thief looks up at carol virtually within the same moment that she spots him. his expression never changes. he takes a step towards her, smiling... then, with a movement that is both abrupt and casual, he snatches up the money bag and disappears behind the constant traffic of train patrons. doc has seen the thief. recognizing the suitcase he moves immediately after him. carol follows doc but is unable to keep up. she watches as doc vanishes behind the row of lockers. carol rounds the last locker in the row but both men have now disappeared from view. she sags back against the edge of the metal compartments, exhausted, fearful.}
<C>__{loudspeaker voice}
<P>__{(indistinct above the roar of the station)}
<D>__{attention please.}
<C>__{loudspeaker voice }
<D>__{the flyer now boarding at gate three. the flyer now boarding at gate three.}
<A>__{carol again raises her eyes. still breathless, her face glows with moisture.}
