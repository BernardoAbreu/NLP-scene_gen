<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{just praying to god that we don't kill ourselves going over this wall.}
<A>__{the hammer unwraps his leather straps, and then tosses them high over the wall. the boxes on the straps catch on a pipe. the line is pulled taut, and the boxes hold secure against the pipe. the hammer and mo begin to scale the wall a la the 60's batman and robin television show. the hammer leads the way while mo, directly behind him, has his arms wrapped tightly around his waist. the hammer stops climbing for a second, and turns to him.}
<C>__{hammer }
<D>__{you know, you don't have to hold on to my waist. you're tied in.}
<A>__{mo releases his arms from the hammer's waist. indeed, he is tied in.}
