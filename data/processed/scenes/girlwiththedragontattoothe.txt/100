<A>__{they sit together at a little table on the sidewalk.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{how is henrik?}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{good. engaging. i like him.}
<A>__{she does, too.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{i haven't seen him in over 30 years. or my sister. or anyone else in my family.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{most of what i'm writing about predates that, so your recollections are valid.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{i wouldn't know where to start, if that was a question.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i can narrow it. i've gotten up to the 1960s. to the event that altered everything in henrik's life.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{harriet.}
<P>__{(he nods)}
<D>__{everything i knew about that i told to whatever his name was that policeman when it happened.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{morell.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{my recollections then were a lot better than they are now.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i'm not speaking of the crime itself. i'm trying to get a clearer sense of what harriet was like. particularly, toward the end.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{she was messed up. like all us vanger kids. crazy mother. drunken father. at least hers wasn't a nazi like mine.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{was he abusive?}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{mine?}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{hers.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{i never saw it myself, but you could tell something was going on. one day she'd be withdrawn. the next she'd be putting on makeup and wearing the tightest sweater she had to school. the next she'd be studying a bible like a nun no vanger was ever religious can you imagine? obviously, she was very unhappy.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{she never confided in you what about, specifically?}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{there was no specifically. it was everything. it was being part of that family. henrik's the only decent person in it.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{what do you think happened to her?}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{everyone knows what.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{but you have no ... thoughts about why, or who.}
<C>__{anita}
<D>__{all i know is i always felt sorry for her. even more than for myself. i got out of there when i was 18 and never went back. she would have done the same but didn't make it to 18.}
