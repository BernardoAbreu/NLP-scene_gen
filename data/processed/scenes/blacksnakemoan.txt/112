<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior lazarus' home night}
<A>__{rae's smoldering eyes don't leave laz as he chains her to the radiator. laz nervously preaches, trying to avoid the sight of her bare legs curled up on his couch.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{my daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. that's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. know why it's best to rotate em like that?}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{uh uh.}
<A>__{laz moves in close and starts applying antibacterial cream to the cut above rae's eye.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{cuz once in a while soil need a change. corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. so next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. that give off a lot of nitrate. change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.}
<P>__{(regarding the eye)}
<D>__{sting a bit?}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{itches.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{means ya healin'.}
<P>__{(a nod)}
<D>__{so all this farmin' make me think on matthew. matthew 13. the parable of the sower? man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{uh uh.}
<A>__{laz starts putting the cream on her scabbed knees. he rubs them gently.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{the seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of god... and understand the word of god. not enough for you to hear what i'm sayin', you gotta understand.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{i know. i get it. what's matthew doin'?}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{gal... matthew ain't doin' shit... this just a story...}
<P>__{(quelling his frustration)}
<D>__{look it. i've seen it in nature, i've seen it in men. ya got to change up your crop. cuz that seed ain't gettin' in.}
<P>__{(rae remains silent)}
<D>__{ya gotta cut this shit out. got no cause to be up under these fools, ruttin' on ya like you a bitch. like you somebody's dog. no woman... who joins in union with almighty god... or man... in the sanctity of marriage... should degrade herself... and bend to another man's will!}
<A>__{rae is aware that laz is somewhere else, talking to someone else other than her. there is anger in his tone as he rubs ointment on her bare, scabbed knees.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{my god, gal, don't you got no sense? i ain't sayin' i ain't weak? shit. playin' guitar in the blood bucket jukes all ya life... a nigga learn how to sin, let me tell you!}
<P>__{(grips her by the legs)}
<D>__{i got sin in me! i ain't go'n lie! but i got respect! and all you got is bile, gal!}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{let go of me...}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{givin' up that switch like a tramp! behind my back and kill my baby...!}
<A>__{rae yanks free of laz's grip, recoiling on the couch.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{get off me!}
<A>__{laz awakens from his rant. he blinks and stands. a sudden shame overtakes him. he crosses into the kitchen to hide by the sink. he pours rae a glass of water and returns to her side.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<P>__{(offering her the glass)}
<D>__{didn't mean to go off on a tear like i did. i just got to thinkin' about things...}
<A>__{rae leans up into his face. the glass of water is touching her chest. laz remains hypnotized by her eyes.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{why is it you old men gotta talk so much? like little boys, gotta talk yourself into fuckin' me.}
<P>__{(his knuckles touch her skin)}
<D>__{we can take our time. i'm grown. i get it.}
<P>__{(she leans even closer)}
<D>__{you wanna give me 'nother bath?}
<A>__{laz stands and backs away. he quickly leaves the room.}
