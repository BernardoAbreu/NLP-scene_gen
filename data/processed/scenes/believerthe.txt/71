<L>__{exterior suburban street interior car day}
<A>__{danny and drake pass a low slung modern synagogue. a sign announces: ambassador ilio manzetti friday, august 31. danny reacts, startled...drake smiles.}
<C>__{drake}
<D>__{park up there, we'll walk back.}
<L>__{exterior congregation beth shalom twilight}
<A>__{the building is lit. within we hear an amplified voice, presumably manzetti giving a speech. we can't make out the words. danny and drake are hidden among the rhododendrons flanking the parking lot. danny is watching a door in the side of the building and eating a sandwich as drake loads a scoped rifle.}
<C>__{drake}
<D>__{lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{why me?}
<C>__{drake}
<D>__{you want to kill a jew. i already did.}
<A>__{danny assumes the prone position, drake sets the rifle in his hands.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{who'd you kill?}
<C>__{drake}
<D>__{four. but no one this important.}
<A>__{we hear applause within as the speech ends.}
<C>__{drake}
<D>__{okay, it's over. he'll take a couple questions, then come out.... sight down the rifle toward the door.}
<A>__{through rifle scope: danny pans from the side door where two men are smoking to a waiting limousine.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{how did you know they were jews?}
<C>__{drake}
<D>__{i can tell....}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{drake}
<D>__{i was a jew in a previous life.}
<A>__{before danny can respond, drake gestures toward the synagogue.}
<C>__{drake}
<D>__{here they come.}
<A>__{danny puts his eye back to the scope. scope pov: stirring at the door. the men put out their cigarettes. three figures emerge: a man and a woman on either side of an older, distinguished looking man (manzetti). they walk this way.}
<C>__{drake }
<D>__{shoot him in the head. always shoot a jew in the head.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{i'm a bad shot. i don't think i can }
<C>__{drake }
<D>__{just get him in the cross hairs. with those shells, anywhere you hit him, it'll bounce around, rip his insides all up.}
<A>__{scope pov: the trio walking this way, cross hairs on manzetti.}
<C>__{drake }
<D>__{right there! just squeeze he trigger. slow... do it!}
<A>__{danny fires, misses. everybody hits the ground.}
<C>__{drake}
<D>__{you missed on purpose.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{i didn't. i told you, i can't }
<C>__{drake}
<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{danny looks over his shoulder. his shirt has ridden up his back, revealing the tallis wrapped around his waist.}
<C>__{drake}
<D>__{i knew it.}
<A>__{drake pulls a .45 from the duffel.... without thinking, danny rolls over, fires the rifle. drake is blown backward, dropping the .45. danny leaps up.... drake's on his hands and knees, his trousers quickly darkening with blood. danny's upset.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{oh, jesus...drake, are you okay...?}
<A>__{footsteps, coming this way. danny runs. we hear voices, "get down.... stay down.... he's got a gun...." drake picks himself up, stumbles away, bent over....}
