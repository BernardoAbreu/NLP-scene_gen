<L>__{exterior city hall building morning}
<A>__{as dulaney and rebecca walks up the steps they are engulfed by a crowd of reporters. dulaney puts his arm around rebecca and ushers her through the crowd.}
<L>__{interior cardenas' office morning}
<A>__{dulaney and rebecca sit on one side of a table. reese stands. cardenas sits at his desk.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i didn't know that andrew was dead until mr. sattler called me at home that night.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{we have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{she's not denying she was there.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{did you have sex?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{what time did you leave?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{six thirty and he was very much alive.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{miss lawson, do you use cocaine?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i have.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{did you use it the night marsh died?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{no. i haven't done it in years.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{did marsh use it?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{no never.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{it had to get there somehow.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{it didn't get there from me.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{were you aware of mr. marsh's heart condition?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{mr. marsh's cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied mr. marsh to their office on at least two occasions.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{that's correct but andrew never told me he had a heart condition. he said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{he never mentioned his heart disease?}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{she just said that.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{why do you think he lied to you?}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{that's something only marsh would know.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{i think miss lawson knew it too. i think she slipped him the coke and he popped his cork giving her the high hard one.}
<A>__{dulaney's anger shows. he stands.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{that's it. my client doesn't have to take this crap from you.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{sit down, frank.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{no. miss lawson came in here voluntarily to answer your questions. she doesn't have to sit here and be insulted. so, either you charge her now or we're leaving.}
<A>__{a beat. dulaney and cardenas lock eyes. cardenas shrugs his shoulders.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{fine.}
<A>__{dulaney motions for rebecca to get up. she stands and they walk to the door. reese looks at cardenas. cardenas nods.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{rebecca lawson, you're under arrest for the murder of andrew marsh.}
<A>__{rebecca is stunned frightened. she looks at dulaney in disbelief. dulaney looks at cardenas angrily. reese removes his handcuffs as he moves towards rebecca.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{you have the right to remain silent. if you give up }
<C>__{cardenas}
<P>__{(to reese)}
<D>__{i don't think the handcuffs will be necessary. you can finish giving miss lawson her rights outside.}
<A>__{reese grabs rebecca by the arm and leads her to the door. she looks back at frank, her face filled with fear her eyes welling with tears.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<P>__{(frightened)}
<D>__{frank!}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{i will have you out in a few hours.}
<A>__{reese ushers her through the door. a beat. dulaney and cardenas are left alone. cardenas starts fishing through a can of nuts, carefully extracting the cashews. dulaney continues to stand.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{lookin' to make the papers, john?}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will. that's motive. she admits to being there the night of his death. that's opportunity and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you can't show intent.}
<A>__{cardenas looks at dulaney wryly. he knows that dulaney is trying to discover his game plan. cardenas looks into his can of nuts and fishes for another cashew.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{can you?}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{take your pole out of the water, frank. the fish ain't biting today.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{you're bluffing. john, it's me, remember? i've known you since your name was juan carlos.}
<A>__{cardenas doesn't appreciate dulaney mentioning his real name.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{c'mon think about it. if she was going to kill marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to find?}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{she planned this. she wanted us to find the nasal spray.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{why would she want that?}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{because she's clever. because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in marsh's condition would use cocaine.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{suspicions maybe but suspicions aren't enough for a conviction.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{the m.e.'s report stated that marsh's nasal membranes showed no sign of prior cocaine use. without the nasal spray we would have still treated it as a poisoning. we would have looked for motive and the trail would have still led back to her.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{i don't buy it and neither will a jury.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{we're going all the way on this one, frank. tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two fifteen to twenty five.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{i will tell her but she won't take it.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{then she's not as smart as i thought she was. you've seen her in the depositions. tell me you don't have any doubts?}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{she's innocent.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{aren't they all?}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{yeah. well we'll let the blindfolded lady with the scales decide that.}
<A>__{dulaney gets up slowly and leaves.}
