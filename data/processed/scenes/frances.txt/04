<L>__{interior farmer home family room evening}
<A>__{frances is now reading aloud from her diary, gently swaying back and forth in a rocking chair. an older woman, lillian farmer, sits opposite on the couch, listening and nodding from time to time. a small suitcase stands by the front door.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{it usually worked. god became a superfather that couldn't spank me. but if i wanted a thing badly enough, he arranged it.}
<A>__{ernest farmer appears in the doorway and hesitates, listening to his daughter read.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{but if god loved all of his children equally, why did he bother about my red hat and let other people lose their fathers and mothers for always?}
<A>__{ernest goes to frances and kisses her softly on the top of her head. she looks at him briefly, smiling slightly.}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{bye, baby.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{see you next weekend, dad.}
<A>__{he goes to the door and picks up his suitcase, glances at lillian. she doesn't look up. he leaves.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{i began to see that he didn't have much to do about hats or people dying or anything. they happened whether he wanted them to or not, and he stayed in heaven and pretended not to notice.}
