<L>__{exterior giles' back yard garage night short time later}
<A>__{on the garage door as it slowly raises up. wider the uniforms, standing with kale, wait as the door opens all the way. a light comes on inside. giles and uniform #1 come out the inner garage door as uniform #2 giles drags the blue bag out from the garage. sure enough, there's blood smears and visible strands of matted hair near the top. uniform #2 unties the bag, pulls the sides away. everyone gathers around, peers inside, then suddenly yank themselves back at the horrible stench emanating from within. kale eyes uniform #1 who gestures him to look. kale steps toward the bag. kale's pov we peer into the bag to reveal the wide open eyes of a dead deer.}

<P>__{(to the cops)}
<D>__{i hit it the other night. thought i'd save a few steps and get it off the road myself. i was gonna bury it sooner, but it's been a helluva week }
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{so why'd you have to have the car fixed in record time, huh? because it was covered in her blood }
<C>__{giles}
<P>__{(talking over him; re: mustang)}
<D>__{because it's a classic, i got it out of storage for the auto show, i needed it in pristine condition. uniform #2 it's one of the biggest in the world.}
<P>__{(off uniform #1)}
<D>__{the auto show.}
<A>__{all eyes on kale. he slumps. giles has an answer for everything.}
<D>__{uniform #1 i think we're done here. sorry for the intrusion, sir.}
<C>__{giles}
<D>__{please, i understand.}
<A>__{as the uniforms lead kale back down the driveway...}
<C>__{kale}
<P>__{(quietly; drained)}
<D>__{so where's my friend, then? can anyone tell me that? does anyone believe me?!}
<A>__{kale looks over, sees parker, standing with julie whose eyes are filled with it all: anger, concern, sadness...}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{kale, come on }
<A>__{kale turns back to giles' house. sees lights being turned out inside. as kale shifts his gaze forward, he locks eyes with ashley standing in the crowd of neighbors. she watches him with concern. kale turns away, drops his head as the cops, parker and julie lead him away... a flash of lightning in the distance...}
