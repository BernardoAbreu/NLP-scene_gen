<A>__{willard shouts out to the starnge greeter.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{we've been attacked.}
<C>__{australian}
<P>__{(shouting back)}
<D>__{i know, i know, it's all right. come in this way. it's mined over there. this way. it's all right.}
<A>__{willard look at chef who is at the helm. he shrugs and they do as this man says. the p.b.r. moves towards the water's edge where there is a dock covered with concertina wire. the odd australian stands waving his hat, guiding them safely in. a thick greasy smoke hangs from fires that burn near the fort; fresh shell craters indicate a recent battle. near the dock there is a tangled clump of corpses half sub merged in the water. other piles of bodies lie about, some of them on fire. fire literally burns from out of the ground. chef nods at the bodies.}

<C>__{willard}

<A>__{chef automatically offers moonby a winston.}

<D>__{so kurtz is alive.}
<C>__{moonby}
<D>__{kurtz. i tell you, that man has enlarged my mind.}
<A>__{he opens his arms wide, to indicate the breadth of his mind's expansion.}
<C>__{moonby}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{but lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that i've come on so far. he wanted to shoot me. the first thing he said is, 'i'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter.' i said i didn't desert from your army, i deserted from my army. he said, 'i'm going to shoot you just the same.'}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{why didn't he shoot you?}
<C>__{moonby}
<D>__{i've asked myself that question. i said to myself, why didn't he shoot me? he didn't shoot me, because i had a stash like you wouldn't believe. i hid it in the jungle; the wealth of the orient: marijuana hashish opium cocaine uncut heroin; the gold of the golden triangle. and acid i make koolaid that makes purple owsley come on like piss. now i'm kurtz' own disciple i listen he talks. about everything ! everything. i forgot there's such a thing as sleep. everything. of love, too.}
<C>__{chef}
<D>__{love?}
<C>__{moonby}
<D>__{oh, no, not what you think... cosmic love. he made me see things things, you know.}
<A>__{the whole time moonby is chattering on, willard has picked up his field glasses and scans the fortress.}
