<L>__{int crowded bar night}
<A>__{summer and tom stand by the bar.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i just don't get women's fashion nowadays. everybody with the tattoos, the giant hoop earrings, those annoying hats. explain this to me.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{people think it looks good.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{do you?}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{on some.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i like how you dress.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{yeah? what if i started wearing berets and got a huge butterfly tattoo on my leg?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{please don't.}
<A>__{a tall, well built, good looking douchebag guy has suddenly appeared next to them.}
<C>__{douche}
<P>__{(to summer)}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{tom and summer stop talking.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{douche}
<D>__{how's it going?}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{tom puts his hands in his pockets and watches this exchange go down. not sure what else to do. at this point he's more amused than concerned.}
<C>__{douche}
<D>__{you live around here?}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{yeah not too far.}
<C>__{douche}
<D>__{i've never seen you here before.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{you're not too perceptive.}
<C>__{douche}
<D>__{ha. that's funny.}
<A>__{tom smiles to himself. this guy's a tool. nothing to worry about.}
<C>__{douche}
<D>__{so, uh, let me buy you a drink.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{no thank you.}
<A>__{as she answers summer gives a quick glance over to tom. the guy notices. up to this point he had not connected the two of them together.}
<C>__{douche}
<D>__{are you with this guy?}
<A>__{tom realizes he has to sort of say something now.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{hi. i'm tom.}
<C>__{douche}
<D>__{whatever.}
<P>__{(to summer)}
<D>__{come on, one drink. what are you drinking?}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{sorry, no thank you.}
<A>__{tom is pleased.}
<C>__{douche}
<D>__{you're serious? this guy?}
<A>__{and now he's pissed.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{hey buddy }
<C>__{summer}
<P>__{(to the douche)}
<D>__{don't be rude. i'm flattered, i'm just not interested. now why don't you go back over there and leave us alone, ok?}
<C>__{douche}
<D>__{it's a free country.}
<A>__{summer and tom make eye contact again, as if to say "now what?" after a beat:}
<C>__{douche}
<D>__{so you and him, huh? i can't believe that. is this guy really your boyfriend?}
<A>__{and that question hangs in the air. tom, panicked, decides to cut the silence. all the pent up uncertainty and confusion, coupled with the challenge to his manhood in front of the woman he loves, all manifests in one single, solid, almost automatic right cross to the good looking douchebag's face. which connects spot on and sends the douche reeling. both douche and tom wince at the pain (douche's chin, tom's fist). there's a beat of calm where tom is actually sorta surprised. and then the douche spins around and starts pummelling tom.}
