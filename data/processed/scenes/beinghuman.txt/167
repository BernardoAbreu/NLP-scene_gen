<L>__{exterior beach day}
<A>__{hector and betsy are walking on the shore. thomas tags along behind them.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{what's she like? how did you meet her?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{the funny thing is i fell in love with her before i ever saw her... i smelled her... it was the day i got out of jail... i was on the train and she was sitting behind me... it was just this incredible perfume... remember i'd been inside for nearly two years with four hundred sweating males... she got off the train and i followed her... i couldn't help it... that's how good she is... she listened to a bum who followed her off a train...}
<A>__{betsy looks at him kindly.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{... but she's still going to kill me on monday...}
<A>__{they share a laugh. betsy looks out to the ocean.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{i think i will paint the sunset tonight.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{it's just like a big pancake up there, isn't it?}
<A>__{betsy doesn't take the bait. there is a silence.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i remember when you two were tiny.. i used to watch you sleeping... it was like now... i felt close to you, could touch you... but you weren't there... you were gone... dreamland ... just when i was closest to you, you weren't there... i felt it last night, too.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{that's what it's like... you should know that.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i'm not smart about things like that, usually.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{don't be so tough on yourself. you seem to want to be... you don't have to...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{no?}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{no... we can do that...}
<A>__{she smiles. hector is out of his depth with this daughter of his.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{is that a joke?}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{no, i mean it... look out for yourself...}
<A>__{hector looks at her in wonderment. one of those moments when another human being stands before you and is an utter mystery.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{who are you? who's inside there?}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{you'll never know.}
<A>__{future generations of women are going to be just as unknowable to our hectors as past ones were. betsy moves off briskly along the beach. hector trails after her, hooked.}
