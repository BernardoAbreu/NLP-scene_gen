<L>__{exterior maiden's tower day}
<A>__{a magnificent ornate tower in the centre of the bosphorus. an innocent looking launch coasts up to it. a tarp is raised and bond and christmas are revealed, hands bound. they are helped out, led inside by a number of henchmen.}
<L>__{interior maiden's tower day}
<A>__{elektra crosses the hallway as the doors open. kisses bond on the cheek as she eyes christmas.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{james bond and his amazing resurrection. if only you'd kept away, we might have met again in a few years, become lovers once more.}
<A>__{christmas eyes bond anew as elektra leads him to an ornately carved chair, covered in silk.}
<C>__{elektra}
<P>__{(to guards)}
<D>__{take her to renard.}
<A>__{bond and christmas exchange a look as the guards start her towards some steps. elektra indicates for him to sit. behind him, the whole of istanbul is visible through a large curved window.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{pretty thing. you had her too?}
<A>__{bond ignores her.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{i could have given you the world.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{not interested.}
<A>__{this cuts. she casually reaches behind his neck, flips up a wooden arm to which is attached a metal collar. a garotte.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{they were digging near here and they found some very pretty vases. they also found this...}
<P>__{(meaning the garotte)}
<D>__{i think we ignore the old ways at our peril, don't you?}
<A>__{bond recoils as she fastens the collar... she steps back.}
<C>__{bond}
<P>__{(ignoring her)}
<D>__{where's m?}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{soon she'll be everywhere.}
<A>__{bond keeps his cool:}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{all this, because you fell for renard?}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{five more turns and your neck will break.}
<A>__{she moves to the back of the chair, twists the screw one notch. the effect on bond is instantaneous as a bolt jolts into the back of his neck, tilts his head back.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{since i was a child, i've always had a power over men. when i realized my father wouldn't rescue me from the kidnappers, i knew i had to form a new alliance.}
<C>__{bond}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{you turned renard.}
<C>__{elektra}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{just like you...only you were even easier.}
<A>__{she pulls the jewel from her ear, reveals the ugly scar:}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{i told him he had to hurt me, he had to make it look real. when he refused i told him i would do it myself.}
<A>__{she turns the screw again.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{so you killed your father.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{he killed me! he killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.}
<A>__{a flicker of emotion. bond is getting to her.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{was this all about the oil?}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{it is my oil! mine and my family's!}
<A>__{her eyes are shining. she moves toward the view, gazing out at this spectacular cradle of civilization. bond works his wristbinds feverishly.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{it runs in my veins, thicker than blood. i'm going to redraw the map. and when i am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfather's name, the glory of my people.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{no one will believe this melt down was an accident.}
<A>__{she eyes him, impressed that he's worked out her plan. tightens the screw again. her confidence amazing.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{they will believe. they will all believe.}
<A>__{tightening the screw again:}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{you understand? nobody can resist me.}
<A>__{now she straddles him. she puts the jewel back on her ear. all the time, he's working that wristbind.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{know what happens when a man is strangled?}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{elektra, it's not too late. eight million people needn't die.}
<A>__{she smiles, twists the screw again. a nasty, grinding sound. sweat trickles from his brow. she licks it away.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{you should have killed me when you had the chance. but you couldn't. not me. a woman you've loved.}
<A>__{she pushes her hips into his. turns the screw. the bolt is jammed right into the back of his neck. his face is angled upwards. breathing is difficult. he glares up:}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{you meant ... nothing ... to me.}
<A>__{she fingers the bolt. prepares to turn it the last time...his hand strains at its binding...}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{one... last... screw?}
<C>__{elektra}
<P>__{(kissing his ear)}
<D>__{oh james.}
<A>__{she begins to turn the screw... ... when several gunshots are heard outside. bond is on the edge of consciousness. elektra freezes. gets off him. moves to a window.}
