<A>__{cauldron of soup being pulled over it dislodges a small cauldron that is near the edge. we see the soup fall and hear the scream of a woman before showing her agonized face she has been scalded. general steamy confusion. the chef has filled the plate. we proceed the buss boy out. half way down the aisle, the waiter takes it from him. the camera follows the waiter who places the soup before mr. preysing. preysing has been waiting, with his serviette carefully tucked in his collar. his spoon is in his hand. a horrible man, ready for action. the soup is in front of him, he tastes it, pushes it away, frowns, we feel he is going to tear the place down.}
