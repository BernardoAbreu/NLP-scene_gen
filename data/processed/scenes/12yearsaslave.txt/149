<A>__{hours have passed. bass reflects on the story that epps has told in the intervening.}
<C>__{bass}
<D>__{how many years all told?}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{just nearly...just passed eleven.}
<C>__{bass}
<D>__{your story is...it is amazing, and in no good way.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{do you believe, sir, in justice as you have said?}
<C>__{bass}
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{that slavery is an evil that should befall none?}
<C>__{bass}
<D>__{i believe so.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{if you truly do, i would ask...i would beg that you write my friends in the north, acquainting them with my situation and beseeching them to forward free papers, or take such steps as they might consider proper to secure my release.}
<A>__{bass looks at solomon, holding his gaze for more than a prolonged beat.}
<P>__{solomon (cont’d)}
<D>__{my daughter margaret is possibly now 19 and my son alonzo, 16. i miss them so. it would be an unspeakable happiness to clasp my wife and my family again.}
<A>__{bass hands solomon an end of a long plank of wood and looks over his shoulder, as if to camouflage the conversation by work. they both lift it toward the floorboards. finally bass speaks.}
<C>__{bass}
<D>__{i have always forgone relationships and family. i did once have a sweetheart who i loved deeply.}
<A>__{bass points to a measuring tool, which solomon immediately hands over.}
<P>__{bass (cont’d)}
<D>__{but that was a long, long time ago. i've been traveling this country for the best part of twenty years. my freedom is everything. the fact that i can walk out of here tomorrow gives me most pleasure. i see the aching in your eyes, the pain of not being attached to your loved ones. my life doesn't mean much to anyone, but it seems your life means a lot to a lot of people. what you have just said to me scares me, and i must say, sir, i am afraid. not just for you, but for me.}
<A>__{they continue working, fixing the floorboards in unison. solomon, slightly confused.}
<P>__{bass (cont’d)}
<D>__{i will write your letter sir, for if i could bring freedom to you, it will be more than a pleasure. it will be a duty. now, would you be so kind as to pass me those nails, sir.}
<A>__{we pull back to reveal the two men dwarfed by the unfinished structure. they continue to work, as if the conversation had never occurred.}
<B>__{omit omit omit}
