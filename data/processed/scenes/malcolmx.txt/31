<A>__{all traffic has stopped, there is a huge spontaneous celebration going on. black folks are everywhere, it seems as if all of harlem is out on the streets. the citizens of harlem are hugging, kissing, drinking, dancing, folks are hanging from street lamps, yelling out their windows, holding up hand made joe louis banners, everyone has great reason to be joyous. the heavyweight champion of the world is a black man joe louis, the brown bomber, he has regained his championship. close: malcolm malcolm quickly looks at his watch, he's running late for his train, as he fights his way through the crowd like a salmon going upstream, the camera cranes up to see him eventually get lost in a sea of black humanity "cutting loose."}
