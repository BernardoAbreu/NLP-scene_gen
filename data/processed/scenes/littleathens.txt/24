<A>__{heather and harry follow the lifeguard into the pool area, where several bystanders have gathered around the victim, bystander #1 and pete among them. heather gets to the victim first, but stops short she recognizes the victim. harry brushes past heather.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(to bystanders)}
<D>__{can you give us some room, please?}
<A>__{the crowd backs up a bit, and harry checks for vitals.}
<C>__{harry }
<P>__{(looking up to heather)}
<D>__{she's breathing.}
<A>__{harry looks the victim over a bit.}
<C>__{harry }
<P>__{(to lifeguard)}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{lifeguard}
<D>__{i'm not sure. she just passed out, right where you see her.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{did you see her eat anything?}
<C>__{lifeguard}
<D>__{uh uh.}
<A>__{heather turns and walks back toward allison coming through the gate carrying the backboard and first aid kit she wants a word with allison. they talk in hushed tones.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{i know her.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{yeah? how?}
<A>__{allison hands heather the first aid kit as they move back toward harry.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{when i was dating steve, that slut fucked him.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{she started dating steve right after we broke up. i mean right after. i asked him if there was another girl, and he never answered. he couldn't answer, because he was fucking that slut.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{that doesn't mean they fucked.}
<A>__{heather gives allison a disapproving look, as if to say "don't be stupid, stupid." as heather and allison approach the victim, harry looks up.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{alright, she ain't comin' around.}
<A>__{allison lays the backboard adjacent to the victim, and the three place her on the backboard. heather is a bit rough.}
<C>__{harry }
<P>__{(instinctively)}
<D>__{whoa, easy.}
<C>__{heather}
<P>__{(without looking up)}
<D>__{i know what i'm doing.}
<A>__{harry gives a concerned look to allison, who returns the look, but the two say nothing. they place the victim into the back of the ambulance as heather looks on.}
