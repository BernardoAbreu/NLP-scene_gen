<A>__{we see a schematic of jason's battered body on the monitor. nano technology is already at work. hoses and wires now encircle jason's body. we follow one of the hoses until it ends over }
<B>__{a waste bend}
<A>__{nside we see pile of bullets. stuff falls from the hose. bullets from the chaingun, bullets from every previous jason movie. a broken machete blade drops to the pile. the tip of an arrow. a couple of knives. a pair of pliers. an ink pen. the skeleton of a fish. the scanning lasers move to the stump at jason's shoulder. we see the image as a new arm, fuzzy adn distorted, is being constructed. on the schematic, we see jason's internal organs being repaired. by now we've figured out ...nothing good can come of this.}
