<D>__{next year, man. next year we sell out. next year we dominate.}
<B>__{on coach winters again}
<A>__{still fielding questions.}
<D>__{reporter #2 you still need a deep threat or a breakaway back to go with joe kane. what are you gonna do to address this need?}
<C>__{coach winters}
<P>__{(a little edgy)}
