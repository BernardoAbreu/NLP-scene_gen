<L>__{exterior tarker's mills consolidated school afternoon}
<A>__{it's a comfortable red brick building on a side street. ivy climbs up the sides. two or three rows of bikes stand along one side of the building. sound: the bell rings. a beat or two, then the doors bang wide and a billion kids spill out. it's the end of the first day of school, and they are excited. they range from grade 1 to grade 8. most kids book it for home as fast as they can, getting on their bikes and riding or just running. everyone has a pink report card.}
