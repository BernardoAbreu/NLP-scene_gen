<C>__{rifkin}
<D>__{henry lamb? who's that?}
<B>__{angle to include peter fallow and rifkin}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{he was a student of yours at ruppert high. in your english class.}
<C>__{rifkin}
<D>__{he was? what's he done?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{he was seriously injured. i'm a journalist. i write for a newspaper.}
<C>__{rifkin}
<D>__{oh. i don't remember him.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{what i would like to find out is what kind of student he was.}
<C>__{rifkin}
<D>__{well, if i don't remember him, i guess he was okay.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{would you say he was a 'good' student?}
<C>__{rifkin}
<D>__{'good' doesn't really apply to ruppert high. they're either cooperative or life threatening. there's no in between.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{his mother says he was considering going to college.}
<C>__{rifkin}
<D>__{well, she means city college. they have an open admissions policy. so, if you live in the city and you graduate from high school and you're still breathing, they have to take you.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{well, is there anything at all you can tell me about his performance or aptitude anything at all?}
<C>__{rifkin}
<D>__{look, mr...?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{fallow.}
<C>__{rifkin}
<D>__{i got sixty five students in every class...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{do you have any of his written work?}
<C>__{rifkin}
<D>__{oh, jesus, there hasn't been any written work at ruppert high since... oh, fifteen years. maybe twenty.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{well, there must be some record of how he measures up to the others...}
<C>__{rifkin}
<D>__{no. see, you're thinking about grades and honor students and high achievers. we don't make those kinds of comparisons. we're just trying to keep them off the street. at ruppert high, an honor student is somebody who comes to class and doesn't piss on the teacher.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(pauses; then)}
<D>__{well, by that standard, is henry lamb an honors student?}
<C>__{rifkin}
<D>__{well, he never pissed on me. so by that standard, yes. i guess he must be.}
