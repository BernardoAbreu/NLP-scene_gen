<D>__{we'll see.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{either way, we'll handle victoria from here on out.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{she's been laying low. ever since your freaky sister showed up. guess she can't stand you cullens either.}

<D>__{good.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{what? what key point?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{if any of them bites a human, the truce is over. that's bite, not kill.}
<C>__{bella}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{but... if i choose it, it's none of your business.}
<A>__{jacob is horrified, starting to shake with rage.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{if you... what!? no. no way. i won't let you }
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{ bella, step back }

<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you don't speak for her!}
<A>__{edward pushes jacob away; he flies back ten feet in the air, but mid air he phases into a wolf! the jacob wolf lands on all fours, spinning to face edward in an attack stance. edward shifts stance, as well, readying for a fight }
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{stop!}
<A>__{edward and jacob circle one another, seconds from lunging }
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(to bella)}
<D>__{get out of here. now!}
<A>__{but bella races between them, forceful, insistent.}
<C>__{bella}
<P>__{(to both of them)}
<D>__{you do this, you'll be going through me.}
<A>__{a long tense beat, none of them backing down it could go either way }
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{i swear to god, i'm not moving.}
<A>__{both rivals see she's dead serious. edward backs off, ever so slightly... the jacob wolf does the same.}
<C>__{bella}
<P>__{(turning to edward)}
<D>__{give me a second. please.}
<A>__{edward shakes his head. doesn't move an inch.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{read his thoughts. is he going to hurt me?}
<A>__{edward does, and finally, reluctantly backs away. but his eyes never leave the wolf's. they glare at one another. bella carefully approaches the jacob wolf, blocking his line of sight. her voice is kind, pleading.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{jacob, i love you. you're my best friend. but... i can't change how i feel. please don't make me choose.}
<P>__{(quietly, emotionally)}
<D>__{because it'll be him. it's always been him.}
<A>__{anguish sweeps through the wolf's fierce face. it's even harder to take than when he's in human form }
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{but you know how important you are to }
<A>__{suddenly, the wolf bolts out of there... on bella fighting tears as she watches him disappear...}
<C>__{bella }
<D>__{there were problems ahead. seemingly insurmountable...}
<A>__{edward's arms wrap around her from behind.}
<C>__{bella }
<D>__{... if i didn't become a vampire, the volturi would kill me. if i did, my best friend would do the job himself, or get killed in the attempt.}
<A>__{she turns to face edward, looking into his loving eyes...}
<C>__{bella }
<D>__{victoria was still on the loose, putting everyone i loved in danger...}
<A>__{he kisses her tenderly, washing away her concerns.}
<C>__{bella }
<D>__{but i'd already survived the worst losing edward. so i knew i could survive anything...}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i'm here. always.}
<A>__{and she sees that's the truth, believes it. he takes her hand and together they turn, heading out of the woods...}
<C>__{bella }
<D>__{and soon, i'd be like him. we'd face our fate together. forever.}
<A>__{off them, hand in hand, inseparable... as we begin to }
<T>__{fade to black:}
<A>__{... hear the agonized howl of a wolf in the far distance...}
