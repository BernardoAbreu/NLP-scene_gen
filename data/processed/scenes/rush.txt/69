<A>__{niki's car pulls in, to be mobbed by jubilant mechanics as he gets out of his car, removing his helmet, embraced by a delighted luca di montezemolo... ...then falling into a passionate kiss with marlene... champion of the world, he is immediately swallowed up by reporters who are demanding interviews in italian, german, english...}
<L>__{exterior usa gp paddock day}
<A>__{an impromptu party in the paddock area. the victor's garland still round his neck, proudly holding the fia world champion trophy, his hair matted with champagne, niki passes through the crowds, accepting everyone's congratulations.. he runs into james, who's in bare feet as usual. marlene is pulled away to talk to someone else..}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{congratulations.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{though with a car like that, the rest of us never stood a chance...}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{maybe the fact the car is so good might have something to do with me.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{you're still in a ferrari. and i'm still in a hesketh. on equal terms, the way it was in formula 3, i'd beat you, and you know it.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{never. you might get lucky and win one race. maybe two. because you're aggressive. but in the long run, over the course of a season, no chance.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{why's that?}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{because you're not serious. you're just a party guy. which is why everyone likes you.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{now try saying that and tell me you're not jealous.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{but all that affection, all those smiles is also a sign of their disrespect! they don't fear you. whereas compare that to me...}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{whom no one likes...}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{right..}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{not even his own team mates..}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{right! because i'm relentless. i don't screw up. i go to bed early. i look after myself, look after my car. and then, soon as the race is finished, i go home. you should go home more often, too. i heard you got married.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{i did.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{so where is she?}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{in new york. working.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{you know i've never seen you with her, once...}
<A>__{niki turns to marlene, "let's go"..}
