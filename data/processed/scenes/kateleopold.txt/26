<A>__{instantly, regis and kathy lee loudly berate each other before an excited crowd. leopold jumps back several feet, hands flailing in front of him as if shooing away a bee. he quickly, yet cautiously, slams the power off.}

<D>__{horrible!}
<A>__{he quickly scurries out the hallway. he stops abruptly. he remains very still. composing himself, he turns and deliberately faces the room. after a moment, he purposefully steps back inside. he makes a large arc around the television set, is confronted by one of charlie's sculptures and makes an arc around that. he finds himself in front of a light switch and gingerly examines it. as he does, track lighting illuminates the room. he looks at the lights then back at the switch. he flicks the lights on and off, trying to figure out the precise moment in the transfer of power, laughing in spite of himself. kate and charlie enter. they watch leopold flicking the lights, laughing like a madman. charlie gives kate a look.}
