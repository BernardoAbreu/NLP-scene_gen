<L>__{exterior sid's bedroom window day}
<C>__{sid }
<P>__{(as interrogator)}
<D>__{oh, a survivor. where is the rebel base? talk!}
<A>__{sfx: hand slap}
<L>__{interior sid's room continuous}
<A>__{an inanimate woody flies across the room, landing hard on the floor. sid crosses to the window.}
<C>__{sid}
<P>__{(as interrogator)}
<D>__{i can see your will is strong.}
<A>__{sid opens the window shade. bright sunlight shines down onto woody.}
<C>__{sid}
<P>__{(continued)}
<D>__{well, we have ways of making you talk.}
<A>__{sid pulls out a magnifying glass from his back pocket and focuses the beam on woody's forehead.}
<C>__{sid}
<P>__{(as interrogator)}
<D>__{where are your rebel friends now? heh, heh.}
<A>__{a bright white hot dot forms on woody's forehead and begins to smolder.}
<C>__{sid's mom }
<D>__{sid!! your pop tarts are ready!}
<A>__{sid pulls the magnifying glass away.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{alright!!}
<A>__{sid runs out of the room. as soon as he's gone, woody jumps up screaming, his forehead burning. he runs to a bowl of half eaten cereal (with milk) on the floor, and dunks his head in. buzz runs over to woody, pausing to remove two suction cup darts from his person before pulling woody out of the bowl. two colorful froot loops stick to each of woody's eyes like glasses.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{are you alright?}
<P>__{(whacking him on the back)}
<D>__{i'm proud of you, sheriff. a lesser man would have talked under such torture.}
<A>__{woody looks at his reflection in the back of the cereal spoon and rubs the burn mark on his forehead.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{i sure hope this isn't permanent.}
<C>__{buzz}
<P>__{(checking his wrist communicator)}
<D>__{still no word from star command. we're not that far from the spaceport }
<A>__{woody's eyes light up. angle: spoon sid's bedroom door can be seen in the reflection. it's open.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{the door! it's open! we're free!!}
<A>__{woody runs for the door. buzz follows.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{woody, we don't know what's out there!}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{i will tell you what's aaaah!}
<B>__{the mutant toys}
<A>__{suddenly appear and block their path to the doorway. woody hides behind buzz.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{they're gonna eat us, buzz!! do something! quick!}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{shield your eyes!}
<A>__{buzz fires his laser at them. the little red beam just flickers against babyface's head. the mutant toys look confusedly at each other.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{it's not working. i recharged it before i left. it should be good for hours }
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{oh, you idiot! you're a toy! use your karate chop action!}
<A>__{grabbing buzz like a hostage, woody fends off the mutant toys by pushing a large button on buzz's back, making buzz's arm involuntarily "chop" up and down.}
<C>__{woody}
<P>__{(to mutants)}
<D>__{get away! hoo cha! hoo cha!}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{hey!! hey! how are you doing that? stop that!}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{back! back, you savages! back!}
<A>__{woody circles around the mutant toys to the open doorway, continually chopping buzz's arm.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{woody, stop it!!}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!}
<A>__{woody drops buzz and runs out the door.}
