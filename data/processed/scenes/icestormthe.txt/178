<A>__{sandy and wendy are sitting on the floor. he grabs his g.i. joe.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{check this out. he's supposed to talk all kinds of stuff, but he's like malfunctioned.}
<A>__{he pulls the dog tag on the doll, and g.i. joe emits a plastic macho voice.}
<C>__{g.i. joe}
<D>__{mayday! mayday! get this message back to base!}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{same thing. again and again.}
<A>__{wendy takes the doll and yanks the cord.}
<C>__{g.i. joe}
<D>__{mayday! mayday! get this message back to base!}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{it's gonna get a lot colder tonight, i predict. probably a blackout. do you have candles in your house? i know where the candles are, and i have my own flashlight. over there. also, i know where every emergency exit is on this floor.}
<A>__{during the course of his monologue, as wendy looks on, sandy calmly ties a noose for his doll.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{this knot's called a bowline.}
<A>__{he puts the noose over the doll's head, as wendy holds him.}
<C>__{g.i. joe}
<D>__{mayday! mayday!}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{let's hang him.}
<A>__{sandy drapes the noose over the edge of a dresser drawer. g.i. joe dangles. they both look at him in silence. the silence continues.}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{he's dead.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{if it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{he wouldn't blow up. he'd just get all mangled or twisted.}
<A>__{she takes him down and lays him flat on the bed. and then begins to remove his clothes. sandy looks on, desirous.}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{well.}
<P>__{(noticing his lack of anatomy)}
<D>__{it looks like someone got to his private parts before us.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{communist viet cong.}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{they left it in the jungle.}
<A>__{they speak with high seriousness. wendy slides up on the bed where sandy sits, a pillow on his lap, and one by one, with exaggerated slowness, she removes her snowboots, as if they were stiletto heels.}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{can i get into your bed?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{with you?}
<A>__{sandy begins to shake.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{we we have to go to the guest room. we can't stay in here. what if mikey? my parents?}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{don't worry about them. they're at that party, getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about mcgovern and stuff.}
<A>__{sandy begins to cry.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{it's just it's just }
<A>__{she takes his hand, and they walk out of the room and down the hall, into the guest room.}
