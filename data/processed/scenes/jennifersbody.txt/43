<B>__{a series of newspaper headlines}
<A>__{the familiar soft shoulder ballad plays as we see a dreamy montage of headlines. the headline of the devil's kettle sun post simply reads: "why?" the headline of the minneapolis star tribune reads: "'butchered': devil's kettle youth brutally murdered in wake of devastating fire." a smaller headline on the front page of the new york times reads: "minnesota town rocked by grisly murder, blaze."}
<C>__{needy v.o.}
<D>__{we were famous. we were saints. our town's only bar had burned to the ground and our star quarterback was somebody's quarter pounder. the whole country got a huge tragedy boner for devil's kettle. and the press god, they couldn't get enough of our little world of shit.}
<A>__{we see devil's kettle citizens holding a tearful candlelight vigil by the former carousel site. they softly sing along with the soft shoulder song.}
<C>__{mourners}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{through the trees, i will find you...}
<A>__{we see weeping students shoving flowers through the slats of jonas' abandoned locker. the hallway floor is covered with teddy bears and bouquets. we see the passing of time as the bouquets wilt and the blooms droop. the pile of discarded scratch off tickets next to needy's mother's bed grows steadily as the days go by. another star tribune headline. this one reads: "two weeks later, cannibal killer still at large." a smaller subhead reads "arts: local band soft shoulder sign to major."}
<C>__{needy v.o.}
<D>__{the days marched on as usual, but most of us were too numb to enjoy ourselves. most of us.}
<A>__{we see jennifer cheerfully skipping down the school hallway in a sleazy technicolor outfit. the rest of the kids look grey, ashen and depressed, but jennifer pops like a roman candle.}
<C>__{needy v.o. }
<D>__{still, we were healing. like chip, we figured things could only get better. we had faith.}
<A>__{we see clusters of cautiously optimistic kids in the school courtyard. they smile, then laugh, as if they're re learning how to be happy.}
<C>__{needy v.o. }
<D>__{we were fucking idiots.}
