<D>__{you see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. what does that get us? a discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. and all because a few starry eyed dreamers like peter bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. now, i say...}
<A>__{george puts down his coat and comes around to the table, incensed by what potter is saying about his father.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{just a minute just a minute. now, hold on, mr. potter. you're right when you say my father was no business man. i know that. why he ever started this cheap, penny ante building and loan, i will never know. but neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was... why, in the twenty five years since he and uncle billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself. isn't that right, uncle billy? he didn't save enough money to send harry to school, let alone me. but he did help a few people get out of your slums, mr. potter. and what's wrong with that? why... here, you're all businessmen here. doesn't it make them better citizens? doesn't it make them better customers? you... you said... what'd you say just a minute ago?... they had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home. wait! wait for what? until their children grow up and leave them? until they're so old and broken down that they... do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars? just remember this, mr. potter, that this rabble you're talking about... they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? anyway, my father didn't think so. people were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. well, in my book he died a much richer man than you'll ever be!}
<C>__{potter}
<D>__{i'm not interested in your book. i'm talking about the building and loan.}
<C>__{george}

<P>__{(to the board)}
<D>__{well, i've said too much. i... you're the board here. you do what you want with this thing. just one thing more, though. this town needs this measly one horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to potter. come on, uncle billy!}

<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{george, now that's just what i like so much about you.}
<P>__{(pleasantly and smoothly)}
<D>__{george, i'm an old man, and most people hate me. but i don't like them either, so that makes it all even. you know just as well as i do that i run practically everything in this town but the bailey building and loan. you know, also, that for a number of years i've been trying to get control of it... or kill it. but i haven't been able to do it. you have been stopping me. in fact, you have beaten me, george, and as anyone in this county can tell you, that takes some doing. take during the depression, for instance. you and i were the only ones that kept our heads. you saved the building and loan, and i saved all the rest.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{yes. well, most people say you stole all the rest.}
<C>__{potter}

<P>__{(indignantly)}
<D>__{forty five!}
<C>__{potter}
<D>__{forty five. forty five. out of which, after supporting your mother, and paying your bills, you're able to keep, say, ten, if you skimp. a child or two comes along, and you won't even be able to save the ten. now, if this young man of twenty eight was a common, ordinary yokel, i'd say he was doing fine. but george bailey is not a common, ordinary yokel. he's an intelligent, smart, ambitious young man who hates his job who hates the building and loan almost as much as i do. a young man who's been dying to get out on his own ever since he was born. a young man... the smartest one of the crowd, mind you, a young man who has to sit by and watch his friends go places, because he's trapped. yes, sir, trapped into frittering his life away playing nursemaid to a lot of garlic eaters. do i paint a correct picture, or do i exaggerate?}
