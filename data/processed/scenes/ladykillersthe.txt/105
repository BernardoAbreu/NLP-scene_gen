<A>__{he escorts her to sit beneath the portrait of othar, sits across from her, and leans confidentially in.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{madam...}
<A>__{he agonizes. the words do not come easy.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...what i am about to reveal to you, you may find... shocking. mrs. munson, i must tell you that we are not... what we appear.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{mm hm.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{we are not in fact musicians of the late renaissance. nor of the early or mid period. we are, in fact... criminals! desperate men, madam! we have tunneled into the nearby offices of the lady luck gambling emporium and have relieved it of its treasure!}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{lord have mercy!}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{it is true that the lady luck is a den of iniquity, a painted harlot luring people into sin and exciting the vice of greed with her false promise of easy winnings. oh, her gains are ill gotten, yes, but i offer no excuses save one! we men have each pledged half of our share of the booty to a charitable institution the general, to a placement service for southeast asian refugees; mr. pancake to the blue ridge parkway conservancy; and lump to the united jewish appeal. as compensation for use of your house we had planned to donate a full share to bob jones university, without burdening you with guilty knowledge by informing you of same. but you have wrested the information from me! now it is all on the table. now you have it, the whole story, the awful truth.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{stolen money!}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{yes, yes, shamefully i admit it, yes! but find the victim, mrs. munson, i challenge you! even the casino itself, that riparian gomorra, shall suffer no harm! it has an insurance company, a financial behemoth that will cheerfully replenish its depleted vaults! that is its function! and the insurance company itself is made up of tens and tens of thousands of policy holders so that we have done the calculations, mrs. munson! so that at the end of the day, at the final reckoning, each policy holder shall have contributed only one penny one single solitary cent to the satisfaction of this claim.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{...just one penny?}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{think of it, mrs. munson! one cent from thousands upon thousands of people so that bob jones university can continue on its mission! why, i have no doubt that, were the policy holders aware of the existence of that august institution, why, each and every one of them would have volunteered some token amount to the furtherance of its aims!}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{well that's prob'ly true...}
<A>__{the professor, warming, has resumed dry washing his hands:}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{yes madam, sadly, the criminal stain is upon my soul, but the benefit shall accrue to any number of worthy causes. as long, that is, as the secret stays with us. and i, surely, shall not be the one to divulge it.}
<A>__{mrs. munson nods, musing.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{well... it's hard to see the harm in it... one penny...}
<A>__{her gaze drifts around the room, a smile beginning to warm her face. the smile freezes, though, as her look catches on something. her pov: othar, above the mantle, looks down with a disapproving scowl.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{...i'm sorry, professor.}
<A>__{dorr is taken aback:}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{excuse me, ma'am?}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{no. it's wrong. don't you be leadin' me into temptation.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{madam, i must strenuously protest }
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{no, it's just plain wrong. stealin'. i know your intentions were good, and i won't call the police if you give the money back. but i gotta see that you do it.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{madam }
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{and all a you gotta go to church with me next sunday.}
<A>__{the professor is incredulous:}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{and... engage in divine worship?}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{i made up my mind. you can double talk all you want, but its church or the county jail.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{but }
<A>__{she rises.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{you think it over. i gotta feed the cat.}
