<A>__{inside a descending elevator, a middle aged woman and her teen aged daughter flip through a magazine together. the elevator sinks toward the ground floor of the south tower, then slows and stops. they both look up at the floor numbers. it's not their floor. the doors slide open. nobody seems to be waiting. the mother pushes the close door button, a bit impatiently. a hand holding a crepe oozing red jam and sugar reaches around into the elevator. the two women cringe, suddenly afraid. kurt, the delivery boy, steps around and into the elevator, smiling broadly, eyes wide and glistening. he drools slightly. the doors slide closed. kurt offers one crepe to each woman.}
