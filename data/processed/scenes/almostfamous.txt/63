<A>__{the stillwater tour bus rumbles down the desert highway. the destination banner reads almost famous tour 73. music continues.}
<L>__{interior bus day}
<A>__{william strains for a look at russell five rows up. he plays slide guitar, working out a part. next to russell is penny lane. penny raises an early model polaroid camera and flash takes a picture of a nearby sleeping jeff bebe.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{gotcha.}
<A>__{jeff grumbles from the depths of a hangover. penny stuffs the shot in her pocket. william watches, his private heart pounds. polexia appears and sits next to him, noticing his shyness.}
<C>__{polexia}
<D>__{do you have any pot?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{no. i'm a journalist.}
<C>__{polexia}
<D>__{well, go do your job then. you're on the road, man. it's all happening! get in there. go talk to 'em!}
<A>__{challenged, william rises and approaches russell. he fixes the charismatic guitarist in his sights. shot takes him down the aisle to the jamming star guitarist. he crouches in the aisle and talks to russell who immediately seems moody. his mood is in the air.}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(very professional)}
<D>__{russell. do you think we might be able to find some time to talk when we get to phoenix? i want to interview everyone separately... and i felt we'd start with you and me.}
<A>__{nearby, jeff now listens in, feeling immediately jealous.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<A>__{russell turns away. the kid squats uncomfortably in the aisle, babbling on.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{because i've got a thing in a couple days.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{what.}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(self conscious)}
<D>__{it's a... thing where... uhm... you go there to graduate. school.}
<C>__{russell}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{i never graduated. and look what happened. you're here interviewing me.}
<A>__{good pointerior laughs from everybody listening nearby. it's a good line. william makes a quick jot in his notebook.}
<C>__{russell }
<D>__{no no no. don't put that in rolling stone.}
<A>__{my bio says i graduated. we'll}
<D>__{come up with something better later. just enjoy the ride.}
<A>__{russell eyes the notebook suspiciously before turning away. penny notices william's discomfort, laughing warmly, all while grabbing a coke and giving one to nearby bassist larry.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{how did you know i was thirsty?}
<A>__{he didn't even realize he was thirsty, but he is. he nods thanks to penny, the perfect road companion for all. and then penny gives the other coke, her coke, to william. he accepts it too, and starts back to his seat. he's been blown off, and he knows it, but before he exits penny grabs his arm and whispers in his ear:}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{i may need to stay in your room tonight. russell's in a bad mood. he's very bob dylan in don't look back today. he's trying to write.}
<A>__{william nods cooly they are comrades and returns to his seat. a large joint passes in front of him, across him, to polexia, as everyone cheers doris the bus rumbling up another hill.}
<C>__{polexia}
<P>__{(inhaling deeply)}
<D>__{want some?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{no thanks.}
<A>__{a wall of pot smoke is exhaled, right into his face. it surrounds him like a cloud. the bus shudders, as russell continues playing slide up ahead.}
