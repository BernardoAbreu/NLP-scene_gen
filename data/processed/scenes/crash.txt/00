<L>__{interior hangar day}
<A>__{we are still moving through light planes, but now we are inside the hangar. some of the planes have their engine covers open, parts strewn around. others are partially covered with tarps or have sections missing. there is even a sleek executive jet parked in one corner. as we float past the planes we notice a woman leaning against the wing of a piper cub, her chest against the wing's trailing edge, her arms spread out to each side, as though flying herself. as we get closer we see that her jacket is pulled open to expose one of her breasts, which rests on the metal of the wing. cu breast on metal. cu hard nipple and rivets. cu woman catherine. early thirties, dark, short hair, stylish executive clothes. her eyes are wide open but unfocussed. a hand grips her shoulder from behind. we follow the hand down behind catherine and discover a man crouched behind her, kissing her back. catherine is standing on a low mechanic's platform and her skirt has been raised and hooked over the wing's flap. she wears garters and stockings but no panties. the man, handsome, cruel looking, rises up behind her, enters her, kisses her neck. catherine half closes her eyes. she rotates her pelvis gently against the thrusting.}
