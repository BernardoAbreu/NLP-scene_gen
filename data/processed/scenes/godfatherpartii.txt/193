<L>__{exterior the united states embassy med. view night}
<A>__{crowds of panicked and frightened tourists, and batistianos are trying to get to the safety of the embassy with the families and possessions. we see geary, and some of the americans we had met, working their way through the crowds, shouting that they are americans in order to get preference on the line. often that declaration brings 'boos' from the crowds. sometimes the joyous cubans will let a family through, but again, taking away the suitcases, rich leather, filled with money and valuables. money seems to be stuffed everywhere.}
