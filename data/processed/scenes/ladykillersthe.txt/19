<L>__{exterior football field day}
<B>__{pov}
<A>__{we are looking out from inside a football helmet; we hear the super present breathing of the helmet's occupant. just over the breathing we can hear the muffled shouting of a snap count. we are in a crouch position looking downfield. at the call of "hike!" we and everyone on the field spring into action. we sprint downfield, the breathing becoming even louder. a very big person downfield is sprinting toward us. after several yards, still on the move, we pan quickly around to look back for the quarterback. barely visible among converging bodies, he is releasing the football toward someone else. easing up on the run we pan back around to look downfield just as the oncoming defender is upon us and crunch slams into us. a strobing pan leaves us looking up at the sky. our loud breathing has stopped. after a long beat the breathing resumes with a raggedy labored inhale. it continues irregularly. another helmeted player appears above us to peer down into our helmet. he extends a hand to help us up.}

<A>__{we are looking back and forth around the circle at our gathered teammates.}
<C>__{quarterback}
<D>__{delta thirty seven. on four!}
<A>__{all, with a simultaneous hand clap:}
<C>__{team}
<D>__{huh!}
<B>__{line of scrimmage}
<A>__{lined up opposite us is a snarling defender. once again, over loud breathing, we can just hear the shouted count. at "hike!" we straighten to meet the defensive lineman lunging at us. his mouthpiece clatters against ours and in horrific close up he strains against us, his animal gurgles of effort audible over our own ragged breath. with a primal roar from the defenseman our pov tips back and up, booming down to stop with a crunch against the ground, staring up. once again our breathing has stopped. after a beat a foot is planted on our helmet as a looming running back steps on us in his charge downfield. he is pursued by defenders some of whom leap over us and some of whom by the sound of it step on various body parts.}

<A>__{the same back and forth pan.}
<C>__{quarterback}
<D>__{okay, epsilon twenty two! you the man!... hey! butthead!}
<A>__{this brings our wandering attention panning back to the quarterback:}
<C>__{quarterback}
<D>__{you the man!}
<A>__{a very, very present voice (hudson):}
<C>__{hudson }
<D>__{me the man?}
<C>__{team}
<D>__{huh!}
<B>__{line of scrimmage}
<A>__{the same breathing and count. on "hike!" we sprint downfield. the same distant defender sprinting toward us. we hear low but very present a dismayed:}
<C>__{hudson }
<D>__{unh... oh no...}
<A>__{our breathing is torn by rasping wheezes of effort as we continue to run. we look back. every player is looking directly at us. a huge spiralling football coming at us too close, too soon and bonk! it bounces off our mouth guard and flies up.}
<C>__{hudson }
<D>__{...shit...}
<A>__{we are looking forward just as crunch! we are hit by the defender. we once again land face up. very steeply foreshortened, right over us, we see the defender juggling the live ball. with a moan, our own hand reaches weakly up towards the ball and the high, distant defender. he finally gathers in the ball and securely tucks it, and starts back upfield. we climb wearily to our feet. we look back upfield just in time to see the defender start an elaborate victory dance in the end zone. he pauses for a moment to point a gloved hand directly at us, then resumes his strut. shouting from the sidelines brings our panning attention over. the coach, face twisted with fury, is shouting at us and using his clipboard to wave us off the field. we trot toward the sidelines. all of our teammates stare at us some in shock, some in anger, some in pity. at the sideline bench our pov swings round as we seat ourself. a hand reaches up to the mouth guard to pull off the helmet and we}
