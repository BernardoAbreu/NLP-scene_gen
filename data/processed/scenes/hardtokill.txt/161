<A>__{ sun (marina del rey) above a perfect peaceful sea. a small powerboat (the kind that you rent from the dock) moves into frame. storm steers it, standing up. andy and sonny in the back cockpit seat. in andy's lap portable tv she switches a channel: up comes the same footage we just saw on the news set.}

<A>__{it takes a beat before she realizes what it is. then:}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{hey ... seven year storm!}
<P>__{(indicates tv)}
<D>__{i told you you'd be famous.}
<A>__{storm takes a step so he can see the screen. views it for a short beat, then }
<B>__{storm}
<A>__{picks the tv up from andy's lap and, while it's still playing, heaves it over the side and into the drink! ocean surface tv splashes ... bobs for a few moments... then sinks beneath the surface.}
<C>__{andy}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{hey! why'd you do that?}
<B>__{storm}
<A>__{watching the last ripples from the sinking set. a moment between him and himself when the past is allowed to slip away, sink out of sight, making way for the future. storm turns back from the water surface, to his son and to the woman he loves. he sits (letting the boat drift wherever it wants to) and tugs andy down beside him. then he reaches across to his son, pulls the boy to him with a playful headlock. for a moment both andy and sonny are held in suspension, wondering what storm will do or say. finally:}
<C>__{storm}
<P>__{(to sonny)}
<D>__{knock, knock.}
<A>__{for a beat, the boy is taken aback. then he break's into a broad smile.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{who's there?}
<A>__{storm glances to andy, pulling her tighter to him.}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{boo.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{boo who?}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{you don't have to cry about it.}
<P>__{(a beat, then)}
<D>__{i love you both.}
<A>__{storm hugs his son with great affection, pulling andy to him with his other arm. this is their beginning.}
<B>__{boat}
<A>__{drifts its happy way across the sun shimmering sea.}
