<A>__{this is a nice upscale pool hall. a party is in progress in a special private area a room upstairs let's say a loft. thirty or forty people in their twenties and thirties are informally celebrating the engagement of two of their friends. it's noisy, it's fun, it's informal. it's not a high end group. by that we mean, not, for the most part young lawyers or stockbrokers. they're mostly blue collar. community college graduates. we open on ed pekurny. he's an attractive man, about thirty. there's still something a little juvenile about him not stupid, just boyish. someone is videotaping him for one of those congratulation montage things that are done at parties these days. ed is good at this. he's not professional but he's a loosey goosey guy who's kind of good on camera.}
