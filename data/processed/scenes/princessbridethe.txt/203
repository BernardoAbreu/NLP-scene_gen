<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{a very thick grove of trees}
<A>__{the trees are unusual in one respect: all of them are extraordinarily heavily knotted.}
<B>__{pull back to reveal}
<A>__{humperdinck and rugen, walking into the grove of trees.}
<C>__{rugen}
<D>__{your princess is really a winning creature. a trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.}
<C>__{humperdinck}
<D>__{oh, i know. the people are quite taken with her. it's odd, but when i hired vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, i thought that was clever. but it's going to be so much more moving when i strangle her on our wedding night. once guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. they'll demand we go to war.}
<A>__{they are deeper into the grove now. rugen is searching around.}
<C>__{rugen}
<D>__{now, where is that secret knot? it's impossible to find.}
<P>__{(finding the knot on}
<D>__{the tree he hits it, and it opens, revealing}
<P>__{a staircase leading underground.)}
<D>__{are you coming down into the pit? westley's got his strength back. i am starting him on the machine tonight.}
<C>__{humperdinck}
<D>__{tyrone, you know how much i love watching you work. but, i've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, my wife to murder, and guilder to frame for it. i'm swamped.}
<C>__{rugen}
<D>__{get some rest if you haven't got your health, you haven't got anything.}
<A>__{rugen smiles and hurries down the stairs as the tree slides back perfectly into place.}
