<L>__{interior social services interview room day}
<A>__{angie sits uncomfortably in a hard plastic chair; the light is flat, fluorescent... in front of her, behind a desk, is a no nonsense social services caseworker, late 30s, cuban.}
<C>__{caseworker}
<P>__{(looks over her paperwork)}
<D>__{so... miss roth.}
<A>__{angie delivers the smile we saw her rehearse with all the warmth she can muster; it's not convincing.}
<C>__{caseworker }
<D>__{why are we here today... says you'd like to apply for custody of your child }
<C>__{angie}
<D>__{delia. her name is delia.}
<A>__{the caseworker looks over the paperwork while angie shifts in her seat... torture.}
<C>__{caseworker}
<D>__{spouse incarcerated, life without possibility of parole. you use your maiden name.}
<C>__{angie}
<D>__{my husband he... it's not entirely true, regarding his sentence. in fact, he's due to be released soon...}
<A>__{she makes brief eye contact with angie.}
<C>__{caseworker}
<D>__{your husband was charged and convicted of first degree murder, miss roth. i can hardly consider his release, if it was to occur, to be a positive.}
<A>__{this is not going well. angie holds her tongue with all of her will, not wanting to make it worse. the caseworker holds all the cards.}
<C>__{caseworker }
<P>__{(changes subject, back at the paperwork)}
<D>__{you're... an actor?}
<A>__{angie nods.}
<C>__{caseworker }
<D>__{not sure if i've seen you in anything.}
<C>__{angie}
<D>__{i work in society.}
<C>__{caseworker}
<D>__{acting, is that what they call it?}
<C>__{angie}
<D>__{it's a job.}
<A>__{angie is hanging on... be pleasant, be friendly, breathe... but inside she wants to cry, to scream, to fucking explode.}
<C>__{caseworker}
<D>__{miss roth. your child has been... exceedingly well placed. the new family is very wealthy. she'll never want for anything.}
<P>__{(leans in)}
<D>__{i understand you love your little girl, but... do you really think she'd be better off with people like you?}
<C>__{angie}
<D>__{yes, i do. i'm her mother.}
<A>__{the caseworker presses a buzzer, unlocking the door behind}
<B>__{angie.}
<C>__{caseworker}
<D>__{we will give your application all the consideration that it merits.}
<A>__{the words burn into angie like battery acid, but there's not a thing she can say.}
