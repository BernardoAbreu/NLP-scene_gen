<L>__{interior dining room night}
<A>__{a chandelier hangs unlit over a long dining table. laughter. at the end nell and the others sprawl over the remains of a dinner which has been going on for hours. luke is opening another bottle of jug wine.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you know what i love about wine that comes in bottles like this?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{luke}
<A>__{every year is a good year.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{theo? it's your turn.}
<A>__{theo twirls her wine glass, licks the dregs inside the rim, thinking.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{the rest of you may hate your insomnia, but i find it the best time of the day for me. i'm alone. nobody's talking to me but myself. my mind is racing with ideas, and i can think.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{nah, you're going crazy with doubt, all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes, and it's worse than a nightmare. }
<A>__{nell isn't used to people being so direct and at the same time, playful. she glances at marrow's left hand: no wedding ring.}
<C>__{theo }
<D>__{excuse me.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{don't give me that look, it's everybody's problem, we just have different variations, i for example. i fall asleep easily. but i wake up around two or three in the morning, every morning. it's that time of night that fitzgerald called the deep dark night of the soul. i stare into... the abyss. every night.}
<P>__{(breaks his own somber mood)}
<D>__{it's the price i pay for being such a jolly fellow.}
<P>__{(to mary)}
<D>__{y usted?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i think i'd fall asleep easily, but just as i start to feel comfortable, i see things in the dark.}
<A>__{nell hears this, nell is tuned into mary.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i feel the presence of something watching me. it's not... scary... not by itself but... i don't want to go to sleep because i'm worried about the thing attacking me. so when i finally do fall asleep, i'm like a soldier who's fallen asleep at her post. i feel like i've betrayed myself. nell?}
<A>__{nell wishes she could hide under her plate.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{all of you have such interesting problems.}
<A>__{there's laughter.}
<C>__{nell }
<D>__{no... please, i know how that sounds but... you're all so articulate. you know how to talk. i feel like i'm here under false pretenses. it's silly, it's not like... well, all of you have trouble sleeping because you live in the world, and the world is complicated and scary, but nothing's ever happened to me. so i don't have a reason to sleep badly.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{you wrote that you had trouble sleeping.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{yes, because someone was always keeping me awake. ever since i was little. that was my job. i took care of my mother and i had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time. and after she died, well, it's been a few months, but i still, i still wake up, it's... a habit.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but i'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this. i'm really happy to be here with you.}
<A>__{silence. the others are embarrassed by her sincerity. she's right, nell is not of their world.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{we're glad you're here.}
<A>__{he says this with enough sympathy for theo to see his interest in the girl in the thrift shop dress.}
<C>__{marrow }
<D>__{why don't we move to another room?}
