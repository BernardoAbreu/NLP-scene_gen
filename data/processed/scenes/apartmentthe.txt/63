<L>__{interior bud's apartment evening}
<A>__{the living room is dark, except for a shaft of light from the kitchen, and the glow of the colored bulbs on a small christmas tree in front of the phony fireplace. hunched up in one corner of the couch is fran, still in her coat and gloves, crying softly. pacing up and down is sheldrake. his coat and hat are on a chair, as are several christmas packages. on the coffee table are an unopened bottle of scotch, a couple of untouched glasses, and a bowl of melting ice.}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<P>__{(stops and faces fran)}
<D>__{come on, fran don't be like that. you just going to sit there and keep bawling?}
<P>__{(no answer)}
<D>__{you won't talk to me, you won't tell me what's wrong }
<P>__{(a new approach)}
<D>__{look, i know you think i'm stalling you. but when you've been married to a woman for twelve years, you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say "pass the sugar and i want a divorce." it's not that easy.}
<P>__{(he resumes pacing; fran continues crying)}
<D>__{anyway, this is the wrong time. the kids are home from school my in laws are visiting for the holidays i can't bring it up now.}

<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{now, fran }
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{and just think right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me }
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{okay, okay, fran. i deserve that. but just ask yourself why does a man run around with a lot of girls? because he's unhappy at home because he's lonely, that's why all that was before you, fran i've stopped running.}
<A>__{fran has taken a handkerchief out of her bag and is dabbing her eyes.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{how could i be so stupid? you'd think i would have learned by now when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{it's christmas eve, fran let's not fight.}
<C>__{fran}

<A>__{he strips away the wrapping to reveal a long playing record. the cover reads: rickshaw boy jimmy lee kiang with orchestra.}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{oh. our friend from the chinese restaurant. thanks, fran. we better keep it here.}

<D>__{ so here's a hundred dollars go out and buy yourself something.}
<A>__{he holds the money out, but she doesn't move. sheldrake slips the bill into her open bag.}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{they have some nice alligator bags at bergdorf's }
<A>__{fran gets up slowly and starts peeling off her gloves. sheldrake looks at her, then glances nervously at his wrist watch.}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{fran, it's a quarter to seven and i mustn't miss the train if we hadn't wasted all that time i have to get home and trim the tree }

<D>__{i just thought as long as it was paid for }
<C>__{sheldrake}
<P>__{(an angry step toward her)}
<D>__{don't ever talk like that, fran! don't make yourself out to be cheap.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{a hundred dollars? i wouldn't call that cheap. and you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment }
<C>__{sheldrake}
<P>__{(grabbing her arms)}
<D>__{stop that, fran.}
<C>__{fran}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{you'll miss your train, jeff.}
<A>__{sheldrake hurriedly puts on his hat and coat, gathers up his packages.}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{coming?}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{you run along i want to fix my face.}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<P>__{(heading for the door)}
<D>__{don't forget to kill the lights. see you monday.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{sure. monday and thursday and monday again and thursday again }
<C>__{sheldrake}
<P>__{(that stops him in the half open door)}
<D>__{it won't always be like this.}
<P>__{(coming back)}
<D>__{i love you, fran.}
<A>__{holding the packages to one side, he tries to kiss her on the mouth.}
<C>__{fran}
<P>__{(turning her head)}
<D>__{careful lipstick.}
<A>__{he kisses her on the cheek, hurries out of the apartment, closing the door. fran stands there for a while, blinking back tears, then takes the long playing record out of its envelope, crosses to the phonograph. she puts the record on, starts the machine the music is jealous lover. as it plays, fran wanders aimlessly around the darkened room, her body wracked by sobs. finally she regains control of herself, and picking up her handbag, starts through the bedroom toward the bathroom. in the bathroom, fran switches on the light, puts her bag on the sink, turns on the faucet. scooping up some water, she washes the smeared mascara away, then turns the faucet off, picks up a towel as she is drying her face, she notices in the pull away shaving mirror the magnified reflection of a vial of pills on the medicine shelf. fran reaches out for the vial, turns it slowly around in her hand. the label reads: seconal one at bedtime as needed for sleep. fran studies the label for a second, then returns the vial to the shelf. she opens her handbag, takes out a lipstick. as she does so, she sees the hundred dollar bill sheldrake left in the bag. her eyes wander back to the vial on the medicine shelf. then very deliberately she picks up bud's mouthwash glass, removes the two toothbrushes from it, turns on the faucet, starts filling the glass with water.}
