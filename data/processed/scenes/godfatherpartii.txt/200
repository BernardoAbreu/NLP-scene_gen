<A>__{despite his new position of 'respect,' there is little changed about his home. only that they have lived there a while now, and the rooms are fuller with the inevitable possessions a young family acquires. he kisses his wife, who seems a big apprehensive. he shows her the fruit; and from her reaction knows she has something on her mind.}
