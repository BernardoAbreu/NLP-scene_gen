<L>__{interior manning house, bedroom day}
<A>__{everything looks normal at first. a typical bedroom with sunlight streaming in through the windows. a bed, made up. flowers in vases. everything looks perfect. we turn with alex. ever so slowly. over to the right and the entranceway of the bathroom. over to where her mother is... ...seated on a chair. dressed in white and radiating warmth!}
<C>__{alex's mom}
<D>__{hi, honey.}
<B>__{her mother}
<A>__{looks beautiful. eyes sparkling. alive and vital. alex can't believe what she's seeing. immediately, tears come to her eyes and her voice falters...}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{mom?}
<P>__{(uncomprehending)}
<D>__{you're alive...}
<C>__{alex's mother}
<D>__{of course i am.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{but i don't understand...}
<C>__{alex's mother}
<D>__{i miss you so much, alex. i want so much to be with you...}
<A>__{tears are running freely down alex's face now.}
<C>__{alex's mother}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i love you, alex. i never wanted to leave. you know that, don't you?}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{yes...but...how did you...}
<A>__{her mother looks ecstatic. and now there are tears in her eyes. joy, reunion...it's unclear which.}
<C>__{alex's mother}
<D>__{magic. we'll be together again.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i know you don't believe in an afterlife, but there is one. heaven is real.}
<A>__{alex looks around her. it's all too much to take in. her mother. back in her own home. sunlight is streaming in, bathing everything around her in gold and the moment is crystallized. a still life. forever.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{is...is that where we are? did i die?}
<C>__{alex's mother}
<D>__{not yet, honey...}
<A>__{her mother stands and alex sees that she is holding a gun...no, the gun, in her hands. she raises at alex.}
<C>__{alex's mother}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{...but i can fix that.}
<A>__{alex has no time to respond. a still born scream is frozen in her throat. a split second of realization. and then her mother fires the gun... crack! the bullet hits alex square in the forehead, snapping her head back as an are of blood and brain matter trail outward. the world spins to a stop, like a record player running down. alex is killed instantly. her body collapse, head thumping unceremoniously against the carpeted floor.}
<B>__{her eyes}
<A>__{open and fixed on infinity. no life here. seems hard to believe that there ever was.}
