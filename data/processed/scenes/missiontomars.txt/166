<A>__{looking down into the cylinder, we see that the cobalt blue fluid has risen to mcconnell's upper chest. now it's at his shoulders! it pours into his suit through his neck ring. he strains on tiptoes, craning his head back, trying to keep his unhelmeted face above the rising liquid. he sucks in deep desperate gulps of air, his head thrashing from side to side. then suddenly the fluid is over his mouth, his nose, his forehead. his whole body is submerged! the level of fluid continues to rise towards the unseen top of the cylinder.}
