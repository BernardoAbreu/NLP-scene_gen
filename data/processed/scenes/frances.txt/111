<L>__{interior a small office day}
<A>__{frances sits in front of a desk nervously smoking a cigarette. lillian stands at a window looking out at a broad expanse of well manicured lawn ending at a row of oaks in the distance.}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{why it's beautiful here! what a view!}
<A>__{lillian smiles enthusiastically at frances, who stares accusingly back: she's not falling for that. an awkward moment of silence. lillian fidgets, doesn't know what to say. she is rescued when the door opens and dr. symington (early 30s, glasses, white coat and ingratiating smile) enters. he holds his right hand out to frances.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{good afternoon, miss farmer. i'm dr. symington.}
<A>__{frances stares at the proffered hand. lillian steps in quickly and takes it.}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{good afternoon, doctor.}
<A>__{the doctor winks at frances and puts a hand on lillian's arm.}
<C>__{symington}
<D>__{i'm very pleased to meet you, mrs. farmer. i'm sure we'll have more of a chance to talk later. right now i think it's important that your daughter have a chance to settle in. perhaps it would be best if you said your goodbyes here.}
<A>__{he smiles pleasantly. lillian is obviously very put off by the idea. she looks at frances who stares unseeingly out the window.}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{oh. well, i have some background that you should probably know about if you're...}
<C>__{symington}
<D>__{i have no doubt, mrs. farmer. if you'll speak to the girl at the desk, she'll arrange an appointment.}
<A>__{he goes to the door and opens it. lillian is momentarily at a loss, but she acquiesces. she bends down and tightly hugs frances, who pats her on the back a couple of times.}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{i will be back real soon, little sister. you be a good girl.}
<A>__{she waits for a reply and then, getting none, starts out the door.}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(staring out window)}
<D>__{mama!}
<A>__{lillian turns back expectantly.}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(warningly)}
<D>__{...i want to go home, mama.}
<A>__{lillian looks to the doctor, who nods sympathetically at her.}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{you'll see, little sister. everything will be fine. the doctors know best.}
<A>__{she goes out and down the hall. the doctor closes the door.}
<C>__{symington}
<D>__{i find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{am i supposed to say 'thank you'?}
<C>__{symington}
<D>__{thanks are hardly necessary.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{aw, shucks, ma'am. t'weren't nothin'.}
<C>__{symington}
<D>__{i'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{it ain't for lack of trying.}
<C>__{symington}
<D>__{so it seems. may we be serious for a moment?}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(seductively)}
<D>__{why, doctor! we've only just met!}
<A>__{he reddens ever so slightly and looks away.}
<C>__{symington}
<D>__{i feel i've known you for a long time... you see, i've followed your career... you're a fascinating case... i'm looking forward to resolving your predicament.}
<A>__{frances' face begins to set in hard planes.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{oh! are you really?}
<C>__{symington}
<D>__{among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. it's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which...}
<P>__{(can cripple your ability to function...)}
<A>__{he stops as frances rises and leans over his desk:}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than i do?}
<C>__{symington}
<D>__{please sit down...}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{you may discuss my predicament, doctor. you may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. i'm not interested. i can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.}
<C>__{symington}
<D>__{i see.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{besides, i don't want to be what you want to make me.}
<C>__{symington}
<D>__{and what's that?}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{normal. average.}
<C>__{symington}
<D>__{all right. will you please sit down now?}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{symington says.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{...did you really say that?}
<C>__{symington}
<D>__{just a little joke, miss farmer.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{this whole thing is a joke!}
<C>__{symington}
<D>__{stay calm, please.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{no, you stay calm, doctor! but you're finding that difficult, aren't you?}
<P>__{(soft, seductive)}
<D>__{why, are you attracted to me? perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...}
<P>__{(turning harder)}
<D>__{and you've torn my personality to shreds, and i'm weeping and vulnerable...}
<P>__{(very hard)}
<D>__{then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "doctor?"}
<C>__{symington}
<D>__{i will have someone show you to your room.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{oh, that's good, very professional. in control. but the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away.}
<A>__{symington stares at her. with a careful, almost scientific gesture he moves thumb and forefinger over his lip, then rubs the two fingers together. yes, there is sweat.}
<C>__{symington}
<D>__{you really should get some rest now. nurse will meet you outside. good day.}
<A>__{he pushes a button on his desk and reaches for a folder. frances hasn't moved. she gazes at him evenly.}
<C>__{symington}
<D>__{is there something else?}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{you didn't say 'symington says'.}
<A>__{his eyes are very calm now, he smiles at her patronizingly.}
<C>__{symington}
<D>__{symington says.}
