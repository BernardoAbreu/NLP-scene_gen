<A>__{ronnie and dennis are driving in the golf cart and they're both wearing those giant sunglasses that they won with arcade tickets. behind them, stevie and the other skaters hold onto the golf cart and get pulled on their skateboards. they race towards a loading ramp. dennis floors it and they go up the ramp and jump the golf cart into the air. the golf cart and skaters soar into the air. it holds forever, until suddenly, the golf cart lands with a thud.}
