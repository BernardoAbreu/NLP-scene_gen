<L>__{interior fedex plane night}
<A>__{chuck and stan ride on the plane. chuck is coming down off his survival high. he has the angel wing fedex package with him.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{when i first showed up, i thought you'd lost your fucking marbles.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i never thought it would end. then it did. it was so great to be saved, i couldn't stop laughing.}
<A>__{stan pulls a flask out of his bag.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{you need a drink.}
<A>__{stan takes two glasses from his bag, rests them on a fedex container, and pours the whiskey.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{for years my only drinking buddy was a soccer ball. wilson.}
<A>__{stan hoists his glass.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{to wilson.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{to wilson.}
<A>__{now's when stan gets to the question he's been wanting to ask, that kelly wanted to know, that we all want to know.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{so, what's it all about?}
<A>__{chuck stares at him.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{you've been over the line and you came back. you've been saved, hallelujah!}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{hallelujah.}
<A>__{stan looks over at him.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{i'm serious. the burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon...}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{what's it all about? it's about being so thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid that's what it's about.}
<A>__{stan sits back, repulsed but relieved.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{do what it takes. that's what i always told you.}
<A>__{he pours another drink.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{to life. fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{to life.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{that's all there is.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{believe me i know.}
<A>__{he takes a sip of his drink, just savoring it, thinking.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{but it's not being bold or being in the game or rolling the dice.}
<A>__{all those things stan used to tell him.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{when i was going crazy, on the raft, i'd argue with myself about everything. because everything had a price. to get anything a sip of water, a little corner of shade, an hour's sleep i had to let go of something else. and then i could never get it back.}
<A>__{he thinks some more.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{you don't win or lose. you win and lose.}
<A>__{he looks out the window.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{you win and lose.}
<A>__{and chuck has. big time.}
