<L>__{exterior hotel black rock day}
<A>__{the townspeople, with doc f.g., are gathered silently in the street, staring sadly, dumbly at the hotel before them. doc wears a dark business suit, neat and conservative. the door opens (o.s.) and the people look up, their eyes lighting with expectancy.}
<B>__{what they see}
<A>__{macreedy comes out of the door, carrying his suitcase. for a moment he pauses, looking at the uplifted faces of the people in the street. in the distance we hear the horn of a stream liner. macreedy goes down the steps, skirts the watching crowd and heads for the railroad station. almost immediately doc falls in step with him. the townspeople, still silent, trail after them moving shot macreedy and doc in f.g., the townspeople behind them. in b.g., as we pass, we see the main street just as we saw it when macreedy entered town a few short hours ago.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(walking, after a beat, to doc)}
<D>__{tim knows where to find me if i'm needed.}
<A>__{doc nods. he blinks and frowns...}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{what's on your mind, doc?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{nothing. only... about that medal. can we have it?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{"we...?" can who have it?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{we.}
<P>__{(indicating the}
<D>__{townspeople, with a vague wave of his}
<P>__{hand)}
<D>__{us.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{well, we need it, i guess. it's something we can maybe build on. this town is wrecked, just as bad as if it was bombed out. maybe it can come back...}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{some towns come back. some don't. it depends on the people.}
<A>__{a noise o.s. attracts macreedy's attention. he turns, as do doc and the townsmen.}
<B>__{what they see}
<A>__{in front of the jail, each of them handcuffed, are smith, coley, hector, sam and hastings. tim and four cops escort them to two state police cars which are parked beside tim's old sedan and another car (presumably belonging to a member of the press). the newspaperman (without a press card in his hat) stands to one side with pete. pete as well as tim have changed clothes; they look clean and trim. coley has his arm in a sling. hector's hat hides the bandage on his head.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{macreedy resumes walking toward the abandoned station, with doc at his side and the people behind him. the train pulls in.}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(still pressing)}
<D>__{that medal would help.}
<A>__{macreedy is silent. he walks on, to the platform. he pauses, looking at the people silently in his wake and then at doc. he takes a black velvet covered box from his pocket the box containing the medal looks at it, and slowly hands it to doc.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{thanks, macreedy. thanks for everything.}
<A>__{macreedy turns and exits from shot. the people look after him.}
