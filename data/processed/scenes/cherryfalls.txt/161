<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{they walk up. 'virgin' has been written in blood on one of the windshields. a mutilated boy looks out of the driver's window of the car. the girl's faces go white. it's another body! more and more kids gather around the murder site. the kids are all freaked, giving each other the eye. no one wants to be nexterior all of a sudden the body moves, screaming to the heavens, freaking all the kids out. the dead body leaps out of the car and runs away as other kids and teachers run over. everyone heard the scream. homely girl 2 whispers to her friend.}
