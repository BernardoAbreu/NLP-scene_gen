<L>__{exterior pier day san pedro present day}
<A>__{it is morning in the aftermath of the opening scene. harsh sunlight shines on a line of body bags on the dock. police swarm everywhere, photographers are taking pictures of the scene while a team of men in rolled up sleeves and plastic gloves pick at the remains. two men on a fire boat operate a water cannon, dousing the smoldering remains of a burned out ships hull. watching this from the edge of the pier is a man in a dark suit. he is special agent jack baer of the f.b.i. he is tall and fit, in his late thirties. he gazes out over the water thoughtfully. a uniform cop trots up to him.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{who are you?}
<A>__{baer holds up his badge without looking at the man.}
<C>__{baer}
<D>__{agent jack baer, f.b.i. how many dead?}
<A>__{before the cop can answer, baer turns and walks along the line of body bags.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{fifteen so far. we're still pulling some bodies out of the water.}
<A>__{baer eyes the corpses on the dock, burned beyond recognition.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{looking for anyone in particular?}
<A>__{baer looks at the cop for the first time, unamused.}
<C>__{baer}
<D>__{f don't want any of the bodies taken away until i've had a chance to go over this, understood?}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{i have to clear the scene. i've got word direct from the chief}
<A>__{baer lights a cigarette, only half listening.}
<C>__{baer}
<P>__{(unimpressed)}
<D>__{yes, the chief. spooky stuff. any survivors?}
<C>__{cop}

<C>__{baer}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{baer walks away from the cop, ignoring him completely. he wanders through the carnage on the pier.}
