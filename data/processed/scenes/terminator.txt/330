<A>__{silberman can be seen through a glass partition next to the bullet proof glass booth enclosing the night desk sergeant's counter. the sergeant hits a button and there is a loud bull clack. the electric bolt on the security door opens and silberman steps out. as he exits the station, he passes terminator just coming in the front door. he glances at the pale apparition in cap and dark wrap arounds, but goes on. terminator approaches the desk sergeant who barely glances up when he speaks.}
