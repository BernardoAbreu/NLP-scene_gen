<L>__{interior motel office (day)}
<A>__{norman crosses to the desk, goes behind it, takes the key to cabin number twelve off the keyboard. sam and lila have entered and are almost to the desk counter by this time.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i will take you to...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{better sign in first, hasn't we?}
<A>__{sam eyes scan the counter, looking for a registration book.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{it isn't necessary.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(interrupting with a friendly cheerfulness)}
<D>__{uh, uh! my boss is paying for this trip... ninety percent business... and he wants practically notarized receipts. i better sign in and get a receipt.}
<A>__{norman stares at sam, as if he'd like to yell at him, call him "liar." instead he reaches under the desk counter, brings out the registration book. lila moves closer, studies the book as sam signs in. sam signs "joe and mrs. johnson." the signature and city of "marie samuels" and after it, the notation "cabin one," can be clearly seen three registrations above sam's. when sam has finished he closes book, hands it back to norman. norman does not take it, starts out from behind counter.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i will get your bags.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{haven't any.}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(after a stare)}
<D>__{i will show you the cabin.}
<A>__{as he starts for the door, sam laughs. norman stops, turns, looks at him.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{first time i've seen it happen.}
<P>__{(to lila)}
<D>__{check in any place in this country without bags, and you have to pay in advance.}
<A>__{sam smiles as if at a funny remark, takes a bill out of his pocket.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{ten dollars...}
<A>__{norman returns to sam, takes the extended bill, is about to start out again.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{that receipt...?}
<A>__{norman goes reluctantly behind counter, lays down the key to cabin twelve, takes a receipt book out of the drawer under counter, starts to write. lila steps up to the desk, picks up the key, quickly, starts out.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i will start ahead.}
<A>__{norman looks up, gazes her as she goes out door.}
