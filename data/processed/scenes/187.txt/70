<L>__{interior bungalow #86 on video camera short while later}
<A>__{(6th period) ... fully mounted now on the wall above the blackboard.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{every eye in the class is riveted on the camera. settle on cesar and stevie seated in the back of the bungalow. off their malignant stares...}
<C>__{cesar}
<P>__{(grumbling)}
<D>__{dog, you invadin' my privacy. bitch.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(remaining calm)}
<D>__{cesar, would you come up here please?}
<A>__{leveling a hard look, cesar swaggers up to the island counter. rita watches, a bated gaze, from her seat. trevor motions for him to come around behind the counter. now trevor removes his grandfather's pocket watch from his briefcase and furtively dangles it for cesar to see.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{since you were so concerned, i though you might like to know... i found my watch.}
<A>__{cesar glares at the watch, looks up at the video camera.}
<C>__{cesar}
<D>__{... you broke into my locker. dat's a serious felony, prof eh. you caught a case for sure now.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{whadda yuh propose to do, cesar? tell garcia?}
<P>__{(as cesar weighs it)}
<D>__{whadda yuh gonna tell 'im? that i broke into your locker to steal back the watch you denied taking? i don't think so. i'd say we're even now, wouldn't you, cesar?}
<C>__{cesar}
<D>__{no, i'd say we're just getting started, ese.}
<A>__{cesar walks out. trevor smiles innocuously. at a stalemate now. you can hear a pin drop. suddenly the cries of an e.n.a.b.l. baby break the palpable tension...}
