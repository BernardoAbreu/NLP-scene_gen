<L>__{exterior ruins of wat}
<A>__{the stone buddhas look on complacently as co attends to rambo's minor wounds. during the ensuing conversation she cleans, applies salve and bandages the wire lacerations and the numerous slashes from brambles and saw edged elephant grass.}
<C>__{co}
<D>__{you try get across laos? get to thailand?}
<C>__{rambo}
<P>__{(nodding)}

<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{how you going to get there? you can't trust the spooks to pull you out. they'll use you up and throw you away.}
<C>__{co}
<D>__{i know. i go with you.}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{i couldn't get you in.}
<A>__{co stops her work and replies very quietly.}
<C>__{co}
<D>__{yes you can.}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{how?}
<A>__{co's gaze holds his and her cheshire grin flickers.}
<C>__{co}
<D>__{as wife.}
<A>__{rambo realizes she is serious. the silence drags when he realizes how good that sounds to him at this moment. and how small a price that is to repay her.}
<C>__{rambo}
<P>__{(with finality)}
<D>__{okay. done. you got it.}
<A>__{she seems a bit shocked, then smiles impishly.}
<C>__{co}
<D>__{you too easy.}
<A>__{co's hands have been all over him but only now does he become aware of them on his shoulders. she draws her face up to his but rambo pulls back from the kiss. co looks puzzled as he slowly disengages from her contact.}
<C>__{co}
<D>__{you don't feel love, rambo?}
<A>__{he leans back against the wall.}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{look, co...}
<C>__{co}
<D>__{why you don't feel love? not allowed?}
<P>__{(her tone becomes aggressive)}
<D>__{dead inside, maybe? you make yourself dead already so they can't kill you? in vulnerabo? bullshit!}
<A>__{she advances on him until her face is close to his, her words finding their mark.}
<C>__{co}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{bucu bullshit!}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i have enough death already. husband. mother. father. brothers. death everywhere.}
<A>__{she points into the undergrowth nearby, to a ghostly blossom growing there among the tangled vines.}
<C>__{co}
<D>__{you see? a flower like that need good soil to grow. many time under earth is bones of animal... or person. killed in jungle. make soil rich. grows most beautiful flower. you call orchid. many deaths in jungle. vietnamese, v.c., american. many beautiful flowers.}
<A>__{rambo studies her intently. an emotional moment for him. he takes her flawless face in his hands, draws her closer. suddenly his head snaps around. a distant thudding of copter rotors becomes audible, growing slowly louder. rambo leaps up, sprinting to a crumbled parapet. below, in the valley, the two hueys are slowly scanning, like angry insects.}
