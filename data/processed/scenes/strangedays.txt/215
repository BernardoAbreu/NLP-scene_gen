<L>__{interior penthouse bonaventure}
<A>__{lenny, moving as if he's in a trance, puts the trodes on his head. tight on the play button as his finger punches down. in pov we approach room 2203. it is the familiar monochromatic vision of the killer. our hands open the door quietly with a keycard. we enter the suite. some of the lights are on. we see faith out on the balcony. watching the sea of madness below. she comes back in, carrying an empty champagne glass. she grabs a bottle off an end table and up ends it. empty. she hurls it across the room, and it shatters against the wall. we approach her, standing with her back to us. closer. only a few feet now. she whips around, startled. gasping loudly. but then... she recognizes the wearer.}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{oh. i didn't hear you come in.}
<A>__{the recording stops, in a blast of static. lenny jerks at the discontinuity in the input, he is so keyed up. the recording restarts: a new image resolves out of static. faith is pushed roughly down on the bed. we climb onto the bed, straddling her, and she gasps. we turn her onto her back. she has been blindfolded. the wearer goes ssshhh. a warning. like the hiss of a snake. our hands seize her wrists and handcuff them one by one to the iron frame at the head of the bed. the hands go out of sight and then reappear holding a set of trodes. they are placed on her head... the spidery gecko hand device almost disappearing in her black hair. lenny's guts have turned to water. he is shaking his head in horror...}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{no, no, no...}
<A>__{in pov we see one of our hands come up holding the yellow plastic razor knife. the blade clicks out to its full length. our hands reach down and slowly slit her dress open, starting between her breasts and going down out of sight. she groans, squirming away from the cold knife. the killer's hands open the material, exposing her white body, which in his peculiar vision is pure ivory. the knife deftly cuts off her panties. we unbuckle our pants and reach for her, grasping her hips, pulling her to us. on lenny, gagging. overcome by revulsion and horror, mixing obscenely with the pleasure flooding into him from the tape. back to pov as we pull our belt out of the belt loops of our pants and wrap it around faith's neck. faith begins to pant in tiny rapid breaths. we tighten the belt slowly. lenny tears the trodes from his head. he clutches his stomach, gasping for breath. carrying the playback deck, he staggers into the bedroom... to the bed. he stares wildly around the room. one whole wall of the bedroom is mirrored. in the mirror he spots a shape, on the floor beyond the bed. it is covered in the bed sheet, but it is clearly a human form, propped up against the wall on the far side of the night stand. he missed it in his earlier look from the bedroom door. lenny moves around the bed and reaches down to the foot of the figure, grasping the edge of the sheet with a trembling hand. with horrified apprehension he pulls on the sheet. it reveals the head and upper body of... tran vo. the last thing he expected. lenny leans close and sees that tran is breathing shallowly, but his eyes are vacant. he looks like tick did. lenny sits on the bed and puts the trodes back on. the fireworks and screaming outside sound like some nightmarish war, like the sound of the world coming to an end. but all lenny cares about is what's on the tape. he hits play. the pov continues where it left off. faith's body lurches with the wearer's thrusts. his hand tightens the belt. lenny feels the climax building. faith's body shakes as the killer comes... she cries out herself, in pain... or is it? the killers hand releases the belt. we see faith gasping for breath and moaning. suddenly the pov whips sideways to the mirrored closet doors along one wall. in the mirror is a reflection of the bed and on it faith. and on her...}
<B>__{... max.}
<A>__{pants down, her legs pulled up around him. they are both gasping for breath, spent, following their shattering orgasms. he runs his hands over her sweat slick belly. lenny is stunned beyond his power to imagine. he does not have the strength or the will to stop the tape. in pov max's hands remove her blindfold. she looks right at us, still gasping with the aftershocks of her pleasure. max's hands undo the handcuffs, freeing her. she reaches for us, her eyes glittering with sated lust. we slump forward onto her, and her face fills the pov.}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{i love you.}
<A>__{lenny is reeling with these revelations. his best friend is the killer. and the woman he loved loves him. but the tape is not over... the pov continues as max's eyes whip around in response to a sound behind them. the bedroom door is opening. tran is standing there, stunned. maybe the first time he's ever been surprised in his life. what a way to start. like lightning we are off the bed snatching our .45 from the night stand and whipping around... putting the muzzle right in tran's face. we pull him roughly across the room, too stunned to resist.}
<C>__{tran}
<D>__{you're going to die, you're both going to fucking die.}
<A>__{we slam him back against the mirror wall and jam the muzzle of the gun right in his mouth: a deadly gag. using the gun we push him down until he is sitting on the floor with his back to the mirror. our eyes whip to faith. she is freaking out. we see max's reflection in the mirror as he talks to her, talking fast.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{this piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby. do you believe that? isn't that right, tran? you pinhead.}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{oh my god. i don't believe this is happening.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{believe it. now bring me the trodes, baby. come on, quick.}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{what're you going to do?}
<A>__{still in a kind of stupor, she hands him the trodes. max puts the trodes on tran's head, then pulls something out of his pocket. it is a booster box. he plugs it into the deck. he takes the gain control and cranks it all the way up. he's setting up a cook off. tran's eyes go wide when he figures that out, starts to splutter.}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{you can't just... kill him.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i'm not. just a little poach job.}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{jesus.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{hey, he was going to kill you. and this ratfuck paid to have iris killed, to save his own sorry ass.}
<A>__{tran freaks at that point but max jams the gun deep into his throat, up to the trigger guard, choking off his words.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you shut the fuck up, right now, i'm gonna pull this fuckin' trigger!}
<A>__{k bang! faith shrieks, thinking max shot him. but it's just the start of the fireworks outside (remember all this has already happened relative to lenny entering the suite).}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{look, baby, it's now of never... the guy is a known input junkie, so a little od won't surprise anybody. it's the only way we can be together. you know it's true.}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{my god.}
<A>__{we don't know if her reaction is to the horror of what is about to happen, or to the realization that she has the capacity to let it happen.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{here's how much i love you, baby.}
<A>__{she stares, transfixed, as max reaches for the deck. he punches play. max puts his hand over tran's mouth to muffle his screams as the input hits his brain like a screaming chainsaw of static from hell. the screaming outside, the pandemonium, give the moment a special madness. the pov turns, looking out the window... staring fixedly at burst after burst of brilliant fireworks. like the fireworks inside tran's head.}
<B>__{the tape ends.}
<A>__{lenny takes off the trodes. he is wrung out, drenched with sweat. we see that there is a figure standing in the doorway behind him. lenny turns, not surprised to see max there with his .45 aimed at lenny's chest. max's surgical gloves look incongruous with his tux.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{don't make any assumptions about our friendship, lenny.}
<A>__{lenny stands up, slowly.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{no. i suppose not. i didn't know you were colorblind, max.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{only way i could stand your ties.}
<A>__{max moves up to him cautiously, and takes the glock out of lenny's waistband.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i will have that. glock 22. nice.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{where's faith?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i sent her to the party. i figured i'd wait up here until you killed tran.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{what makes you think i'm gonna kill tran?}
<A>__{max looks out the window at the fireworks. waits for a flash, knowing that the bang will follow. keeping his own .45 on lenny, he aims lenny's glock at the catatonic tran. blam! one right into tran's forehead. the crack of thunder from the fireworks masks the sound.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you just did.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{jesus!}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you know, statistically that's the second most common word people say right before they die. shit being number one.}
<A>__{max sticks lenny's glock in his waistband, keeping his own .45 trained on lenny. lenny knows the next bullet is for him. he does what he does best... talk.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{so... i killed tran. then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{that's pretty much the way it happened.}
