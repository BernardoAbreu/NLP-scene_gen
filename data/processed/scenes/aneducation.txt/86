<D>__{jenny is at her desk in her bedroom, trying to work, but she can't concentrate. her hair is tied back in a pony tail. she gets up, pulls back the curtains, looks out of the window. we see what she sees: a sleepy suburban street at night. she looks back at her desk. it looks even more boring than the street. she looks at her scrubbed seventeen year old face in the mirror so much younger than the jenny we have seen with david. she makes herself up, and she gets older and more glamorous before our eyes. in her make up and her school uniform, she's half woman, half child. we hear the noises drifting up from the kitchen: the radio, the washing up, occasional muffled conversation. jenny walks out of the bedroom and slips downstairs.}
