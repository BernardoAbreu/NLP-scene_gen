<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior heart of gold. magrathea surface day}
<A>__{the gang stand by a huge crater (the h.o.g. parked in the b.g.) a large whale carcass sits in the middle of it along with a few petunias. they all grimace. beyond the crater they see a formation of large rocks, aligned in a circle. it's the only structure in sight. they walk toward it.}
<L>__{exterior rock formation day}
<A>__{arthur walks behind the others, his head down.}
<C>__{ford }
<D>__{hey...this looks familiar.}
<A>__{arthur looks up, registers surprise. the rock formation looks like stonehenge only newer. the rocks letters carved into them that read "design department" "showroom" "executive offices" "toilets"}
<D>__{ford (cont'd} must be portal doors.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you mean the hippies were right?}
<A>__{in the middle of the circle sits a stone receptionist desk with a sign on it that says "out to lunch." zaphod heads for the "to design department" stone. trillian and ford follow. zaphod feels around it, looking for a switch, a knob, anything. he must've hit something because the front of the stone suddenly slides open revealing a swirling}
<B>__{vortex that looks like a jet engine.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{okay. in we go.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{what?! are you out of what's left of your mind? we can't step into that...that.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{we gotta pick one, right? if it's not the right one, we come back and pick another. no biggie.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{yes big biggie. what if that's the last door we ever step through? what if it rips us into tiny little atomic particle...thingies.}
<A>__{trillian, who hasn't said a word since leaving vogsphere, covers her ears trying to block them out}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{it's the right one. i have a hunch.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{ford..?}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{he's got good hunches. i say we go.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{go with the hunch of a narcissist with half a brain who's wearing a ridiculous thinking cap!? are you insane?!}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{hey, i think i resent that.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i don't care what you think you think...}
<A>__{they all start arguing over each other. we focus on trillian anger and frustration building, she covers her ears then screams....}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!}
<A>__{and she takes off running for the door. suicide? bravery? they turn just in time to see her jump into the vortex. she yelps as her body is bent in half, twisted like a rung mop, then sucked inside. arthur is horrified, literally gasping for air. ford is semi impressed. zaphod, unfazed.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{that's supposed to happen...i think.}
<A>__{ford shrugs, throws his towel around his neck like a scarf and dives through. same thing. bent, twisted...}
<C>__{zaphod }
<D>__{hey, wait for me!}
<A>__{he runs after ford, stops at the door, turns like he's about to board air force one, gives a salute, jumps in. arthur finally gets his legs to move, steps up but hesitates at the threshold, paralyzed with fear, unable to take a step. then ffssssh the door seals shut.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{no. no! nooo!!!}
<A>__{he bangs on the stone, slides his hand around like zaphod did, desperately looking for a way to open it. he collapses and buries his head in his hands.}
<C>__{marvin}
<D>__{i told you this would all end in tears.}
