<L>__{interior living room night}
<A>__{dulaney catches rebecca grabs her spins her around then backhands her across the face, knocking her to the ground. in the b.g. the video of them in bed plays on the screen. dulaney sits on top of her and grabs her by the hair. he repeatedly smashes her head onto the floor.}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{let her go!}
<A>__{dulaney stops. he looks behind him.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{standing in the bedroom doorway is dr. paley. he is holding a gun at dulaney. dulaney stares at him with disbelief as he staggers to his feet, his hand holding the wound on his shoulder. a short, breathless laugh drifts out of dulaney as he starts to put it all together. rebecca stands up, holding her head as she tries to catch her breath.}
<C>__{dr. paley}
<P>__{(to rebecca)}
<D>__{are you alright?}
<A>__{rebecca nods. her face hardens.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{you've got to kill him, alan.}
<C>__{dr. paley}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{she's right, paley. you've got to kill me. she doesn't have to she's free she can't be tried again but you, you planned it with her. you supplied the coke. you're an accessory to murder.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{shoot him.}
<A>__{paley struggles to make a decision. the gun shakes in his hand. suddenly, the whole scheme becomes clear to dulaney.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{don't you see what she's doing? she needs you to kill me. she's planned it that way from the start. that's why she phoned me tonight.}
<C>__{dr. paley}
<D>__{you called him?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{no he's lying.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{how's it supposed to work rebecca? you and paley celebrate your victory. you get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you but then he's given himself away as your accomplice now he has to kill me.}
<P>__{(to paley)}
<D>__{after that i figure she'll tell the police that you broke in. that you were crazed because we humiliated you in court?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{don't listen to him. can't you see he's trying to turn you against me.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<P>__{(continuing; to paley)}
<D>__{here's the good part. the truth dies with me and she turns state's evidence against you. it won't matter what you say. no one will believe your version you've already discredited yourself in court. you'll go away forever and she'll have the money all for herself. she's played us both perfectly.}
<A>__{paley is becoming more and more confused. dulaney moves towards him. paley lowers the gun slightly.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{alan, listen to me. if you don't kill him it's over. everything we did will be for nothing.}
<C>__{dr. paley}
<D>__{shut up, rebecca.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{she's good isn't she? but maybe with you it's the real thing.}
<P>__{(points to the screen)}
<D>__{i'm sure all those nights she was fuckin' me she was thinking of you.}
<A>__{confusion crowds paley's mind.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{i'm sure that every orgasm she had with me was faked.}
<C>__{dr. paley}
<D>__{that's enough.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{i mean she only screwed me two or three times a night because she had to i'm sure she didn't enjoy it.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{i love you, alan. you have to believe i love you. kill him! kill him and we can be together forever!}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{that's right, she loves you. just like she loved roston and marsh and me. don't be a fool. you're nothing to her. the second you pull that trigger she'll turn on you.}
<A>__{betrayal fills paley's face. his eyes fill with tears.}
<C>__{dr. paley}
<P>__{(to rebecca)}
<D>__{i loved you.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<P>__{(tense)}
<D>__{alan, don't let him do this. you're everything to me.}
<P>__{(she moves closer)}
<D>__{give me the gun. give me the gun and i will do it for you.}
<A>__{paley stares at her his mind races. pain fills his face as he fights to make a decision. suddenly, his face tenses. he starts to raise the gun at dulaney then just as suddenly he turns it on rebecca and fires. the bullet hits rebecca in the chest. the force blows her off her feet. paley stares at her blankly. he slowly lowers the gun and drops it to the floor, then staggers over to rebecca.}
<B>__{on rebecca}
<A>__{she stares up through glazed, dead eyes. paley takes her pulse. he breaks down, weeping over her body, his tears signaling to dulaney that she is dead.}
