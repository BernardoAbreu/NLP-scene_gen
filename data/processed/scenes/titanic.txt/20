<L>__{interior lab deck, preservation room day}
<A>__{technicians are carefully removing some papers from the safe and placing them in a tray of water to separate them safely. nearby, other artifacts from the stateroom are being washed and preserved. buell is on the satellite phone with the investors. lovett is yelling at the video crew.}
<C>__{lovett}
<A>__{you send out what i tell you when i tell you. i'm signing your paychecks, not 60 minutes. now get set up for the uplink. buell covers the phone and turns to lovett.}
<C>__{buell}
<A>__{the partners want to know how it's going?}
<C>__{lovett}
<A>__{how it's going? it's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?! lovett grabs the phone from buell and goes instantly smooth.}
<C>__{lovett}
<A>__{hi, dave? barry? look, it wasn't in the safe... no, look, don't worry about it, there're still plenty of places it could be... in the floor debris in the suite, in the mother's room, in the purser's safe on c deck...}
<P>__{(seeing something)}
<A>__{hang on a second. a tech coaxes some letters in the water tray to one side with a tong... revealing a pencil (conte crayon) drawing of a woman. brock looks closely at the drawing, which is in excellent shape, though its edges have partially disintegrated. the woman is beautiful, and beautifully rendered. in her late teens or early twenties, she is nude, though posed with a kind of casual modesty. she is on an empire divan, in a pool of light that seems to radiate outward from her eyes. scrawled in the lower right corner is the date: april 14 1912. and the initials jd. the girl is not entirely nude. at her throat is a diamond necklace with one large stone hanging in the center. lovett grabs a reference photo from the clutter on the lab table. it is a period black and white photo of a diamond necklace on a black velvet jeller's display stand. he holds it next to the drawing. it is clearly the same piece... a complex setting with a massive central stone which is almost heart shaped.}
