Its driver is Campbell, with MacClannough walking behind it. The farmers glance up at William, their faces grim... From his perch in the loft, William sees that the neighbors have brought: the bodies of his father and brother. The cart stops; Campbell, with a bandage around his left hand where more of his fingers are now missing, studies the back of the ox, as if it could tell him how to break such news.

The sight of the boy, standing alone in front of the graves of his dead mother, as the bodies of his father and brother are lowered with ropes into the ground beside her, has all of the neighbors shaken. The local parish PRIEST drones mechanically in Latin. The farmers who were secretly gathered in Malcolm Wallace's kitchen the previous night are now glancing at William; but no one is anxious to adopt a grieving, a rebellious boy. Behind MacClannough are his wife and two daughters; his youngest is barely four, not half William's age; she's a beautiful girl with long auburn hair, and she clings to her own mother's hand, as if the open graves are the mouths of death and might suck her parents in too.}

<ACTION>__{With the final Amen, the neighbors drift from the graveside, pulling their Children along, to give William a last moment of private grief before the grave diggers cover the bodies. The boy stands alone over the open graves, his heart so shattered that he can scarcely cry; a single tear makes its way down his face. And the tiny girl feels for William in a way that the adults cannot. From the ground she pulls a Scottish thistle, moves to the softly weeping William and places the beautiful wild blossom in his hand. William looks up and their young eyes meet; her sad blue eyes hold William's as the grave diggers cover the bodies. Then a lone, mounted figure appears at the crest of the hill above them. Tall, thin and angular, in black clerical garb, he looks like the grim reaper. The girl hurries back to her mother's side; everyone watches in silence as the figure rides down to them. He is ARGYLE WALLACE. He looks like a human buzzard, his face craggy, permanently furious.}

He sits his horse as if born there, his back straight, his hands relaxed on the reins. He has a look of lean, rippled power. He looks dangerous. And the soldiers notice him, nudging each other as he passes. He carries a dead wild goose hanging across his saddle; he stops his horse at the edge of the clearing and surveys the scene. Farmers are roasting a pig; women are comparing handiwork; young men are tossing huge stones in the traditional Highland games -- and everyone is noticing William's arrival, especially the farm women with daughters of marriageable age. Among those watching William arrive is Campbell, grown older now; and with his old rebel friend, MacClannough. William dismounts and ties his horse to a willow.

Old Campbell loses his shield in the grappling; an English swordsman whacks at him and takes off his left hand, but Campbell batters him to the ground with his right, and stabs him. Reaching the English side of the bridge, the Scots begin to build a barrier with the dead bodies. The English are not without courage. Cheltham leads a desperate counterattack. The Scots make an impenetrable barrier of slashing blades. Still Cheltham keeps coming; Wallace hits him with a vertical slash that parts his helmet, his hair, and his brain. TALMADGE has seen enough; he gallops away. The remaining English General tries to save the army.}
