<C>__{george}
<D>__{ah! oh....}
<C>__{kurt }
<D>__{i know there's an explanation.}
<A>__{george pulls back the shower curtains just enough to see kurt standing by in his police uniform.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{no hot water.}
<A>__{george is shivering as he closes the curtain back up.}
<C>__{kurt}
<D>__{mr. dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{check the permits. it was built as a guesthouse. it's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when south laguna was incorporated.}
<A>__{without warning, the copper tubing holding the hanging curtain falls to the ground. george turns the water off and grabs a towel. unfortunately, his ass is not what the towel covers.}
<C>__{kurt}
<D>__{now that should be illegal.}
