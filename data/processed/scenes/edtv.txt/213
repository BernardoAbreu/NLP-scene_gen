<D>__{honcho #1 of more concern than the sag in ed's ratings is what viewers are feeling about him now. the positives are down and the negatives are up. there's a feeling that ed isn't cool anymore. we're starting to see a big l.f.}

<D>__{hm? honcho #1 l.f. loser factor. honcho #2 that's deadly. mcilvaine not necessarily. i mean instead of running from the l.f., run with it. create more moments like the table thing. we can package a video "ed's goofiest moments." let him be america's goofball.}
