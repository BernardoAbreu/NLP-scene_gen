<A>__{erin's car is parked in front. a dirty old pick up comes rumbling up the road. when its lights hit erin's car, it slows, then pulls over. the driver flicks on his brights to get a better look at the car. the truck sits there for a bit, a dark presence. then, as the headlights of another car appear down the road, the truck goes back in gear, pulls out and drives off.}
