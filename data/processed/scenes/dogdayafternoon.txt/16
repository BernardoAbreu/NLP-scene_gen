<L>__{interior bank day}
<A>__{(re moretti's 3rd conversation on phone with sonny.) the group inside the bank have now been waiting approximately twelve minutes since anything last happened. sonny is seated at mulvaney's desk, all the phones off the hooks. the rest of the group is huddled around the vault area where sal is keeping his eye on them. suddenly, sonny jumps up and puts all the receivers back on the hooks, crossing back to sit at mulvaney's desk again. phone starts to ring and sonny picks it up.}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{okay, you're in there and we're out here. what do we do now?}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{i told you keep away. i don't know what we do now.}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{awright, but i wanna talk to you. first off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{they're okay.}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{you alone, or you got confederates?}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{i'm not alone.}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{how many you got in there?}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{i got sal.}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{sal? what's that for? salvatore?}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{sal. he's the killer. we're vietnam veterans so killing don't mean anything to us, you understand?}
<A>__{a cop passing by presses a portable two way radio into moretti's hand: he accepts it and holds as though he expected it. the cop passes the same type of set to certain other officers. these sets are tuned in to each other, and throughout the movie, there is a constant background talk on these sets. this is police procedure; the orders are for everyone to talk about everything. if anyone has a question, has heard a rumor or a sound, whatever, it is immediately responded to, so that there can be the fewest possible surprises. sample dialogue might go: "did i hear a shot?" "over here, by the bank, there was a report like a gunshot, inside." "roger, we heard that from the barbershop... it was inside the bank." "barbershop, you can see inside?" "roger, we heard from the barbershop... it was inside the bank." "barbershop, you can see inside?" "roger, this is the barbershop, we see inside, the perpetrator is moving toward the rear of the bank." "who's that guy walking through the barricade?" "the blue suit?" "yeah." "off duty inspector come down to see can you use him." etc. they really do use the word perpetrator, felon, etc. the cop handing out radios makes moretti sign for it which moretti does during the following:}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{right got ya. okay, so there's you what's your name?}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{what do you want to know that for?}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{give me a name, any name, just so i got somethin' to call you.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{call me sonny boy.}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{sonny boy, one word?}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{one word. you won't find it in the phone book.}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{listen, sonny... can i call you sonny for short?}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{call me whatever you want.}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{okay, sonny, i want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what i want to do is work out a way to get them out of there. i want to come over there, without a gun... and you can frisk me. so you can see you can trust me. so we can talk and find a way outta this mess.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{i frisk you?}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{you frisk me.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{right i'm with you, buddy.}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{i'd like just some sign i can trust you too, sonny. i don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me. some sight... right?}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{sure... like... i'm not gonna shoot you.}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{how about letting the people out of the bank. why put them in this position?}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{they're what's keeping me alive. you think you're dealing with an idiot? talk to me then.}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{okay, give us the women.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{oh, no... women is all we got.}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{you're all one way! i'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin'... give me one of them, anyway... just one...}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{so you want me to send one out there... okay. i will see what i can do.}
<A>__{sonny hangs up and moves over to sal. the rest of the group has been trying to make out what's being said at the other end of the conversation.}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(to sal)}
<D>__{he wants one.}
<C>__{sal}
<D>__{dead or alive?}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{alive.}
<A>__{now sonny looks at the group.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{okay... who's gonna go first?}
<A>__{mulvaney now stands up at his desk, looks over at the group near the vault. they look back at him, waiting for some instructions.}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{it's up to you ladies.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{howard!}
<A>__{they are now unified. sonny whispers something to sal.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{to show that we're negotiating.}
<C>__{sal}
<D>__{all right... send them the guard.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{all right... let's go.}
<A>__{sylvia takes howard by the arms and starts to lead him toward the front door. sal watches as they move toward front door.}
<C>__{sal}
<D>__{cover her, sonny.}
<A>__{sonny moves with them toward the front door, his gun aimed at them during the walk. finally they arrive, and howard moves toward the door by himself. but the door is obviously locked.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{he needs the keys.}
<A>__{sonny gives her the keys.}
<C>__{sal}
<P>__{(from the rear)}
<D>__{only one, sonny.}
<A>__{sonny covers sylvia as she moves to unlock the front door for howard.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{go along, howard.}
<B>__{angle outside door}
<A>__{as howard is pushed out the door by sylvia, a cop from a nearby car rushes up to him and shoves him to a curbside car where he bends howard over the car, putting his hands behind him for handcuffs and starts to frisk him. howard's pov quick cuts about 100 weapons ranging from machine guns to hand guns to sniper rifles are whipped up and pointed straight at his chest and head. the effect is as though he is about to be blown entirely away.}
<B>__{angle on the barber shop}
<A>__{moretti rushes out, screaming to the cop with howard.}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{don't fire!}
<B>__{the radio network screams}
<C>__{radio voices}
<D>__{did he say fire? what fire? do we fire or what? who fired?}
<P>__{(etc.)}
<B>__{various cops}
<A>__{confusion reigns. they don't know if the perpetrator or not, since they haven't yet seen sal or sonny. guns are up, aimed, being pushed down... cops run for better vantage points.}
<B>__{angle on howard}
<A>__{as moretti reaches him. he pulls the cop away from him and starts to give him hell for the rough treatment being given the guard.}
<B>__{angle in door of bank}
<A>__{with sylvia in doorway, staring wildly at the street scene. sonny is beside her covering her with his rifle.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{my god! that's howard! we voted to send him out!}
<B>__{various angles}
<A>__{as the cops slowly realize their mistake. they stand back from howard, who is virtually catatonic with fear and shock now. they get him up, a reluctant to believe they could have made such a mistake...}
<B>__{angle on tv cameraman}
<A>__{near barber shop, across the street, jockeying, trying to focus in on him, elbowing each other, they yell out:}
<C>__{cameraman}
<D>__{hey! come out, get in the light. hey, out where we can get a shot, huh? who's the black guy?}
<P>__{(etc. ad libs)}
<A>__{low angle helicopter (to and from) swings in over street to try for a shot. howard is being taken in the direction of the barber shop.}
<B>__{moretti}
<A>__{to cops.}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{get him outta here!}
<B>__{door of bank}
<A>__{sonny back in the shadows with sylvia, looking at moretti, appalled.}
<B>__{on moretti}
<A>__{behind him a mob scene. howard is being led away, weeping. photographers, cops, a phalanx of cops have their weapons levelled on sonny like a firing squad. it is right on the edge of violence... of blowing up. sonny and sylvia are in the shelter of the doorway, moretti stands on the sidewalk, looking toward sonny inside the bank.}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{sonny come out here a minute.}
<A>__{at this point, he removes his jacket and drops it to the ground, showing sonny that he is unarmed.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{you got these cops outta here. they're comin' in too close.}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{come on. i want you to see something.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{you want me to give up, huh? look, sal's in back with the girls. anything happens to me one move and sal gives it to them. boom boom. how do i know you won't jump me?}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{i don't forget about sal and the boom boom room. i want you to see this.}
<A>__{sonny turns back to tell sal he's going outside. moretti stands well out in the street, to reassure sonny nobody is going to try to jump him. sonny stares around; he nudges sylvia out ahead of him. as they edge into sight of the media across the street:}
<C>__{newsmen and photographers}
<D>__{out in the light. hey, lady! you're on tv, lady! smile, any... god damn thing...}
<A>__{angles showing crowds straining against police lines: this is where we begin to sense the size of the event. people are eating popsicles and ice cream. they are diverted and excited. sonny and sylvia begin to emerge: catcalls and hoots of greeting... closer sonny and sylvia as he looks around, and the impact of his situation really hits him: he's not only totally surrounded, he's an event. some of the crowd cheer him. an army of cops, and guns all levelled on sonny.}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{let sal come out, take a look. what hope you got? quit while you're ahead. all you got is attempted robbery.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{...armed robbery...}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{well, armed, then. nobody's been hurt. release the hostages, nobody is gonna worry over kidnapping charges, the worst you're gonna get is five years you can be out in a year.}
<A>__{sonny stares at him, his face utterly blank.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{kiss me.}
<A>__{moretti stops, stares back.}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(deadpan)}
<D>__{when i'm bein' fucked, i like to be kissed a lot.}
<P>__{(bursting out)}
<D>__{who the fuck are you tryin' to con me into some deal? you're a city cop, where's the fbi? this is a federal offense, i got kidnapping, armed robbery, they're gonna bury me! you know it, you can't talk for them, you're some flunky pig tryin' to bullshit me. now god damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me!}
<C>__{moretti}
<D>__{calm down, you're not...}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{calm down... look at this, look at him...!}
<A>__{gestures at the cops, the wall of rifles and machine guns levelled on him. it is incredible and terrifying...}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{they wanna kill me so bad they can taste it!}
<A>__{he takes a defiant step into the street. the crowd screams as they get their first view, which is of sonny telling the cops off. they don't need to hear the words, they can see it.}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{attica! attica! go ahead! blow off the front of the whole god damn bank!}
<A>__{he holds his hands wide offering himself as a target to the hulking officer.}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(to the tv)}
<D>__{if it wasn't for you guys they'd kill everybody and say it was me and sal.}
<P>__{(to moretti)}
<D>__{you tell 'em to put the guns down. i can't stand it.}
<A>__{he means it. moretti gestures to the officers to back away, lower the guns. the crowd yells: sonny has beat the cops. he is momentarily their hero. it's a breaking pointerior moretti makes a decision.}
<C>__{moretti}
<P>__{(cop language command to put gun away)}
<D>__{all right put the guns down!}
<A>__{he has to yell it twice before the cop slowly, angrily, stuffs the gun into his holster. sound: the crowd screams.}
<B>__{on sonny}
<A>__{hearing the crowd applause. he turns and grins and waves to them. they scream more. he turns and waves to the media. they've been yelling.}
<C>__{media}
<D>__{hey, over here! give us a wave!}
<A>__{it is at this point that newsman leans out a window of the second floor of the bank, quickly lowering a mike boom. sylvia sees this above her head.}
<B>__{on moretti}
<A>__{unhappy, looking around at sheldon, who shrugs. he did what he had to do.}
<B>__{on sonny}
<A>__{suddenly realizing what control he has, enjoying it. he turns mockingly his left and his right profile to cameras.}
