<L>__{64 exterior rabbit cage night}
<A>__{it's quiet now. and out of the silence comes the jingling of zowie's dog tags. zowie's long shadow creeps over the cage, distorted to monstrous proportion by the flickering light. we move past the cages to the back porch... we see zowie's paw scratching at the door.}
<L>__{interior amanda and gus' bedroom night}
<A>__{amanda wakens with a start. she rises, eyes focusing on the dark bedroom. gus is sound asleep next to her. then, from outside, we faintly hear zowie's scratching. slowly, amanda rises from bed, pulling on a bathrobe as she heads for the door.}
