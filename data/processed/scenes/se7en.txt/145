<A>__{mills comes quietly into the bedroom. tracy is asleep in the bed. mills takes off his jacket, puts it down. he sits on a chair and unties one shoe, takes it off. he looks at tracy, looks at her a long time. he puts the shoe on the floor and goes to get on the bed. he kisses tracy's forehead, looks at her sleeping innocently. he is touched, saddened. he kisses her cheek, then wraps his arms under and around her. he holds tight, kisses her again. tracy stirs.}
