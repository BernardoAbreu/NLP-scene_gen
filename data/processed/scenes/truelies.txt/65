<L>__{interior juno's workshop night}
<A>__{a workman guides harry through the maze of statuary. he points toward the back of the warehouse and then leaves. harry is left alone in the vast space. only a few lights are on, rendering the place somewhat gothic. harry strolls in the direction the workman pointed. ahead of him, is the huge facade of a royal tomb. there is a flickering light inside. a shadow moves across the wall in the entryway.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{he enters the stone doorway of the tomb. following harry as he steps into the inner chamber. there is an oil lamp burning on a stone sarcophagus, the only light. the room appears empty. reverse on harry. behind him a figure emerges from a shadowed alcove. it is juno. she looks ethereal in the strange light.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{hello, harry.}
<A>__{harry whips around, startled.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{do you like my tomb? the museum financing fell out, so i thought your clients might be interested.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{it's certainly... dramatic.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{especially in this light. this is the only light they had then, so i like to study it this way. i love this place. i love all ruins.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{is that why you got into this business?}
<A>__{juno turns to him in the flickering half light. she moves closer. her eyes seem to glitter.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i've always been a collector at heart. when i see something i want, i have to have it.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{and you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.}
<A>__{she is very close to him. her eyes seem to glitter in the light from the oil lamp. she is unbelievably beautiful.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{yes, i do.}
