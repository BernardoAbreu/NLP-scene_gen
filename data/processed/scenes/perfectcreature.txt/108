<L>__{int: hospital, steph's room continuing}
<A>__{in the adjacent room two nurses are trying to put in a line to steph's arms which are restrained by straps. steph lies on a bed. she looks truly sick; her hair matted, her skin blotchy. her eyes are also blood red, the tiny blood vessels hemorrhaging. and she is screaming abuse at the nurses and doctors who work on her. close of jones, staring at the scene. silus now enters the room. almost immediately steph stops screaming. she is staring directly at silus; even this deranged, she is still in complete awe.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{will she recover?}
<A>__{the doctor turns to jones; the doctor looks puzzled.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{no. containment is the issue now. she is... insane. and we've had more cases, 10 in the last hour.}
<A>__{the doctor leaves. jones turns to silus.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{what is this? what is it?}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{it comes from edgar. he has shared his blood with them.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{you're telling me that he's out there spreading this around?}
<A>__{jones gets close to silus, intimidating.}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{he'll give it to lilly!}
<A>__{dominic gets in between.}
<C>__{dominic}
<D>__{jones! back off.}
<A>__{dominic pushes jones back and then stares at silus.}
<C>__{dominic}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{this is spreading.}
<A>__{silus doesn't speak, just stares at steph.}
<C>__{dominic}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{brother silus?}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{that's it, lilly's dead.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{no. he will keep her alive.}
<C>__{dominic}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{so that i will come for him. that's what he wants.}
<A>__{dominic pulls an envelope from his jacket and passes it to silus, who opens it to discover a beautifully handwritten letter.}
<C>__{dominic}
<D>__{it says, "everything flows from me. my blood will change the world." what does that mean?}
<A>__{silus stares at the two men. then turns to steph, her eyes, creepy, still locked on silus.}
