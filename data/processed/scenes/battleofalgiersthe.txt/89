<L>__{88 various houses. casbah. outside. dawn. january 28, 1957.}
<A>__{it is gray and smoky dawn, a slow reabsorption of the night, an opaque light which is diffused, sprayed, frozen, to transparency, and rediscovers its outlines and perspectives; and finally, the sun, golden light, awakens all algiers. to the north, the sea. to the south, the mountains and the casbah, situated halfway along the coast. the casbah, still, inert, expectant, on this first day of the strike ... the paratroopers are already at their places, one after another, at equal distances like links of a very long chain, strung through every alley, spreading to every sidestreet, twisting through the squares, climbing up the stairways, dividing, joining, and lengthening again. the silence is perfect; the camouflaged immobile forms seem to be part of the landscape. then a brief and sharp hiss, a hundred whistles together. a signal releases the still forms: the attack begins. doors are beaten down, shots, screams, rifle fire, machine gun fire; the doors opened or broken down; the courtyards, the houses, the rooms, invaded; the men who are trying to escape and who protest and try to save themselves.}
