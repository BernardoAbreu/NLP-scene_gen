<A>__{toby nods. caroline looks up at the evening sky and then shrugs.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{'course, having seen that dog, i wouldn't suggest you hang by your thumbs 'til those papers come. i mean, that dog is ugly.}

<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{well, look on the bright side... you got a dog.}
<A>__{in spite of his disappointment over the rifle, in spite of all that caroline had said about staying with dwight, toby is happy to see caroline completely back to her old self again, joking with him. he grins and, with the palm of his hand, he gives her shoulder a gentle shove. she returns the gesture. and the two of them sit on the steps, staring into the twilight.}
