<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{no, you keep still.}
<A>__{he kisses naomi passionately.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{what are we going to do, arthur?}

<D>__{stop this!}
<A>__{vivienne walks up to the altar.}
<C>__{vivienne }
<D>__{a bach templemead has never been poor and we're not about to try that experiment with you, arthur. that said, you've shown strength of character for once, instead of blubbing on about frogs and friendship. the inheritance is yours. all i ask is, with hobson gone, you finally start treating me like a mother.}

<D>__{sorry, vivienne. i can't do that.}
<C>__{vivienne}
<D>__{i beg your pardon?}
