<L>__{exterior river bank}
<A>__{med. shot. here the river moves quietly down. the bank is sandy. alders and aspens screen it from the meadow. helen sits on the sand taking off her shoes and stockings. her toilet box is beside her. something on the bank catches her attention, she rises and climbs the bank. some branches of aspen cover an object. she pulls the branches away, revealing a crud, miner's cradle or rocker.}
<B>__{med. close}
<A>__{helen stares down at the cradle. she doesn't know what it is.}
<C>__{fowler's voice}
<P>__{(sharp)}
<D>__{what are you doing down here?}
<A>__{helen, startled, turns.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{fowler and helen. they stare at each other.}
<C>__{fowler}
<P>__{(curt)}
<D>__{you got no business snoopin' around }
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(hard)}
<D>__{me snoopin'? i came down here to take a bath.}
<A>__{she glances from fowler to the cradle.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{that something i shouldn't see?}
<C>__{fowler}
<P>__{(flustered)}
<D>__{no. but it's mine and i didn't want anyone foolin' with it.}
<A>__{hurriedly he covers it with branches again. helen watches him, curious, interested.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{fowler}
<D>__{just a thing i was workin' on.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{the way you act, it must be something pretty secret.}
<A>__{when fowler doesn't explain she moves on down the bank and sits on the sand.}
<C>__{fowler}
<D>__{go on. take your bath. i will beat it.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{you wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?}
<A>__{fowler comes over and sits down beside her. he takes [a] sack of tobacco and papers from his pocket. she reaches for them. he watches her wide eyed as she rolls a cigarette. he holds a match for her.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{she turns to the toilet case on the sand beside her, takes out a comb. he glances at the box, then reaches over and from it takes her powder box. he sniffs it. without irritation, as though borrowing a toy from a child, helen takes the powder box from him.}
<C>__{fowler}
<D>__{that sure smells good.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i like it.}
<C>__{fowler}
<D>__{up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{then why stay in the hills.}
<A>__{she looks at him then up the bank where the cradle is.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{that why?}
<A>__{fowler hesitates. helen hands him back the powder box as matter of factly as she took it. he accepts it gratefully, again putting it to his nose. now he looks up at her, regarding her calculatingly for a moment or two. their eyes meet.}
<C>__{fowler}
<D>__{i guess you can keep a secret. that's a gold rocker. i'm doin' a little placer mining in a place nobody ever thought to look for gold before.}
<A>__{he reaches to his throat and lifts over his head a braided loop of rawhide. attached to the loop is a small, plump, soft leather poke. still holding the powder box, he passes her the poke. she starts to work with the thong.}
<C>__{fowler}
<D>__{look at her see her shine. one week's work.}
<A>__{helen still struggles with the thong. he takes the poke, pulls it open, pouring grains of gold into his palm. helen looks at the shining heap in his hand. then she takes the poke and pours some of the grains in her own palm. she looks down at it. her expression is calculating. she looks up at fowler and then the hard look goes away. she gives him a soft smile.}
