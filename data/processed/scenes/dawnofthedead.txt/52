<C>__{trooper 2}
<D>__{shoot it... shoot it through the head.}
<A>__{the young officer is too dumb struck to respond so the third officer pulls out his pistol. then suddenly, from out of the shadows, a spectre like figure lunges at the third officer, flailing and biting at his arms. it is a wild haired woman. there are several bleeding wounds over her body. she is one of the walking dead. the trooper struggles to free himself, and roger darts into the room. although the zombie is weak, she manages to hold on to the trooper. another creature suddenly appears in the bedroom doorway. a male, it staggers out into the room. the young trooper struggles with his holster trying to free his hand gun. suddenly, he feels something on his leg. the dismembered corpse is clutching his ankle, pulling itself closer, it's mouth open. the boy tries to pull away, but falls onto the floor, crashing over a table and lamp. he tries to crawl away, but the frail corpse keeps its hold and drags along behind the young trooper, who still cannot free his pistol. roger and the third officer fling all their weight against the woman zombie. she flies against a wall, but bounces back immediately, and attacks again. the third trooper's rifle fires. a slug tears through the woman's chest but it doesn't stop her onslaught. another shot rips through her neck. still she comes. the boy on the floor manages to level off his pistol. he fires at the ghoulish head which draws closer to his leg. the thing's skull blows open and its grasp relaxes. the boy is shaking violently. his arm and gun stay in the air, still poised. he fires again... and again... and again.}
