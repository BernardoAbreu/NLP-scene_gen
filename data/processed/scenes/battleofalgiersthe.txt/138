<B>__{heavy breathing.}
<A>__{it is the same breathing that soon after mathieu hears, bent in the same position as the captain. the colonel gets up and looks around him. four paras are ready with their machine guns aimed at the hiding place. others are arranging plastic charges along the wall, all of them connected to a single fuse. in a corner, sadek, wearing his cap and army camouflage fatigues, is sitting on a chair. he is watching the scene with his eyes wide open. he is trembling. his body is slouched forward. he seems to be lifeless, without nerves. if it weren't for his face, he would seem to be a heap of rags.}

<D>__{everything ready?}
<C>__{captain}

<D>__{i thought so. it was obvious.}

<D>__{yes, sir ...}

<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{is this one still here? ... take him away.}
<A>__{two paratroopers grab the street cleaner by the armpits and almost lifting him completely, they lead him away. mathieu is about to go out, then turns and takes the megaphone from the captain's hands, and places it to his mouth.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{ali! ali la pointe! i am giving you another thirty seconds. what do you hope to gain? you've lost anyway. thirty seconds, ali, starting now.}
