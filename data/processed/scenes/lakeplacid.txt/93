<D>__{i haven't broken any laws.}
<C>__{keough}
<P>__{(bordering on condescension)}
<D>__{oh, but you have, ma'am. you lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice. a man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, i could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and i'm sure peta would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.}
<C>__{bickerman}
<D>__{the reason i lied is if i'd told you the truth, you'd just hunt it down and kill it which seems to be exactly what you're doing.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{how long have you been feeding this thing?}
<C>__{bickerman}
<D>__{about six years. he first appeared in may of nineteen ninety one. bernie was out fishing and it followed him home. so we threw him some scraps and well... he didn't seem to bother anybody. he became kind of like a pet who lived in the wild.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{he just appeared. you have no idea how he arrived in this lake?}
<C>__{bickerman}
<D>__{no. do you?}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{ma'am. your husband, bernie. you didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?}
<C>__{bickerman}
<P>__{(offended)}
<D>__{no, i did not.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{the crocodile did kill him, though. but it was all... it was a mistake.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{a mistake.}
<C>__{bickerman}
<D>__{one of our horses got loose two years ago, went to the lake to drink and... well the crocodile started coming in, bernie went to intercede and... it was all a terrible misunderstanding.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{if i reported it, they would've sent people to kill it.}
<A>__{keough, kelly and jack can't quite believe what they're hearing. then }
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{ma'am, how could you not report this? he puts human life at risk and }
<C>__{bickerman}
<D>__{nobody lives on this lake. it's really his lake now.}
