<D>__{susan is lying down. a small pool of blood has collected under her neck. she looks restless. she whispers weakly.}

<D>__{i'm going to as soon as i can. i've already called rachel; she's going to tell the embassy.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i told you we shouldn't have come. just then anwar enters. the grandmother takes the basin and sets it in a corner. she gets some pieces of cloth and starts to soak them.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{how long until the ambulance gets here?}
<C>__{anwar}
<D>__{about an hour and a half. it's coming from alnif.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{that much? isn't there anyone here who could take her?}
<A>__{anwar shakes his head.}
<C>__{richard }
<D>__{we've got to get her out of here. there's no one to tend to her.}
<C>__{anwar}
<D>__{my brother already called a doctor, he's coming.}
<A>__{richard is going to say something, but holds back. his despair and confusion are evident.}
<C>__{anwar }
<D>__{trust my grandmother; she knows a lot about remedies.}
<A>__{the grandmother wrings out the rags and puts them on a table. she takes some herbs, a fistful of earth from the floor and she tosses them into the basin. she stirs it and pulls out a clump of mud which she lays out on one of the pieces of cloth. susan looks horrified at the dirt. the grandmother leans over her and tries to clean the wound with the other moistened rags. susan resists.}

<P>__{(in arabic)}

<C>__{anwar}
<P>__{(to susan)}
<D>__{miss, my grandmother is going to help you.}
<A>__{the grandmother finishes cleaning her with the damp cloths and grabs the clump of mud. she tries to put it on the wound, but susan flinches.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{no, not that.}
<C>__{anwar's grandmother}
<P>__{(in arabic)}
