<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior queen's bath day}
<A>__{a room heavy with mist and steam. behind a maze of gauze screens, we discover anne reclining in a large tiled bath, constance attending. constance replenishes the bath with pitchers of hot water drawn from a boiling cauldron. in mid conversation, as confidantes and friends:}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{but how, your majesty? how can you tell if you're really in love?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{do you think about him all the time?}
<C>__{constance}
<P>__{(considers; replies)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{and when he's around, do your knees feel as weak as water?}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{and when he looks at you, do you suddenly forget how to breathe?}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{then you're in love.}
<C>__{constance}
<P>__{(thrilled by the}
<D>__{knowledge; knew it}
<P>__{all alone)}
<D>__{i am.}
<A>__{anne turns to constance, soap and water swirl about her naked body. she wonders:}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{who is he?}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{you'll never believe it.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{of course i will.}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{you won't.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{the young man who rescued us from the bandit.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{the young man on the scaffold?}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(turns back in the water, peers ahead)}
<D>__{you're right. i don't believe it.}
<A>__{a warm beat. anne and constance are friends as much as they are queen and subject.}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{are you in love, your majesty?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{what an impertinent question.}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{are you?}
<A>__{anne pauses. if only her life, her emotions, were as simple.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{my love... is a matter of state. it's complicated.}
<A>__{a sad beat. constance teases:}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{do you think about him all the time?}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(playing along)}
<D>__{as queen, my mind touches on many subjects.}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{do your knees feel as weak as water?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{never.}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{when he looks at you, do you forget how to breathe?}
<A>__{a beat. and anne is a girl of eighteen again, not queen. wistful, she replies:}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{i hope he will someday. i hope i will too.}
<A>__{hold on anne for a beat.}
