<A>__{pi lies, unconscious, in the bow of the lifeboat. waves lap at the sides of the boat, which presses against the shore of an island. a gust of wind blows across pi's face, tousling his hair. pi gradually opens his eyes. a beat. he tips his head back. pi's pov above and behind him, the tops of trees. pi turns, looking at the island, amazed. the trees have a pale bark with an amazing profusion of leaves, their color burning with a neon like intensity. there is no sand; instead the ground is an intricate, tightly webbed mass of tube shaped seaweed, about two fingers in diameter. pi turns to look back to the stern; he calls under the tarp.}

<A>__{pi rises, stepping out of the boat. the seaweed is rubbery uncertain ground. his legs are wobbly. he hooks the gaff on a root and falls to the ground. pi tears up a piece of the seaweed and examines it. he takes an experimental bite. soon he's grabbing handfuls of the seaweed, eating as fast as he can. pi climbs the ridge on unsteady legs. a forest comes into view with nearly symmetrical ponds dotting the island here and there, many of them reaching 40 feet in diameter. half the island seems to be covered with meerkats thousands of them standing together in groups all over the island. the moment the first of the meerkats notices pi, it turns and stands on its hind legs and the others immediately follow suit.}
