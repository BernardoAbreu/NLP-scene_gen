<C>__{v for vendetta}
<D>__{written by larry and andy wachowski based on the graphic novel by alan moore}
<T>__{fade in:}
<A>__{in the darkness, we hear a voice, a woman's voice. her name is evey.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{"remember, remember, the fifth of november, the gunpowder treason and plot. i know of now reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot."}
<A>__{her voice has a strength that is metered by a calmness, a deep centered peace that we can feel.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{those were almost the very first words he spoke to me and, in a way, that is where this story began, four hundred years ago, in a cellar beneath the houses of parliament.}
<A>__{in the darkness, we find a lantern. guy fawkes, a dangerous man who wears a goatee, is struggling with a wheelbarrow stacked with barrels of gunpowder.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{in 1605, guy fawkes attempted to blow up the houses of parliament.}
<A>__{the wheelbarrow bumps over the heavy stone mortar of the cellar floor. from the dark depths, we hear the sound of dogs.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{he was caught in the cellars with enough gunpowder to level most of london.}
<A>__{guy sees lanterns coming from both sides. he tries to run as the dogs reach him first. he grabs for his sword as dozens of pole axes pin him against the tunnel's stone wall.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{sometimes i wonder where we would be if he hadn't failed. i wonder if it would have mattered.}
<A>__{in the dim pre dawn light, guy is led to the gallows.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{i suppose the answer is in the rhyme. more than the man, what we must remember is the plot itself.}
<A>__{the coarse noose of rope is snugged up to guy's throat. he looks into the crowd until he finds a face, a woman's face, staring up at him.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{for in the plot we find more than just a man, we find the idea of that man, the spirit of that man, and that is what we must never forget.}
<A>__{the lever is thrown and the woman looks down, a tear falling down her face.}
<C>__{evey }
<D>__{this, then, is the story of that idea, of that spirit that began with an anarchist's plot four hundred years ago.}
<A>__{guy's body hangs in silhouette, lifeless against a red morning sun.}
