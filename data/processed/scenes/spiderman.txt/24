<L>__{interior basement cyclotron room night}
<A>__{weiner is eating a large sandwich and a drinking a coke.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{i will show them... closing the cyclotron on me... weiner!}
<C>__{weiner}
<D>__{yes, professor...}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{where is he? it's ten past eight o'clock...}
<B>__{a knock}
<C>__{weiner}
<P>__{(with mouth full)}
<D>__{that must be him. he opens the door.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{good evening.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{you are late.}
<P>__{(to weiner)}
<D>__{weiner, go outside and get us something to eat. and don't steal it! just buy it. i will reimburse you.}
<C>__{weiner}
<P>__{(to peter)}
<D>__{do you want anything parker?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{no thank you, i just had dinner at my aunt's...}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{piss off, weiner!}
<A>__{weiner leaves. peter wanders around. he goes into the experimental chamber, he overlooks the spider which is scuttling away and crawls inside the open window... and into the chamber.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{okey, dokey, parker... how would you like to take weiner's place... i mean, be my assistant?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{well, professor, that would be a great honor, but i'm already working with...}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{rosomorf... that imbecile. don't you understand, kid, that i am about to uncover the greatest discovery since einstein came up with his theory of relativity... the "anti force."}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{wow! the theory of the anti force! you should go for the noble prize professor...}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{noble shmoble, i am going for a much bigger prize kid. okey, dokey. let me show you, kid, what i got here.}
<A>__{ock begins the experiment. we move in past the shattered window. we see the spider crawling on the chamber's gear.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{present maximum anti force power to date is 38 percent of theoretical limit. i have patched in the variable particle wave accelerator...}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{i will now try to reach 50% power...}
<P>__{(big breath)}
<D>__{and if your paper has any value... i can use it to get the power i'm missing to create the anti force, to break through and beat any other form of power in our or any other universe, capish!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{sorry, professor, i can't do it. i gave my word to professor rosomorf.}
<A>__{ock is angry... ock now sees the spider. he shoots out a waldo to try and crush it but the spider is too fast. the waldo slams against the wall of the chamber. he starts to push every button or switch in sight. a deafening whining starts. an urgent warning tone causes ock to look at the "relative gravity" dial. it is at "4.999999kg" but suddenly the numbers start to tumble rapidly. insert: the glowing 5kg weight. insert: the power dial inches toward 50% power!}
<C>__{ock}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{50 percent... anti force... 50 percent... that's all i'm missing! parker, we can be rich together!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{sorry... i'd better go now.}
<C>__{ock}
<P>__{(really angry now)}
<D>__{you'll be sorry, parker.}
<A>__{peter leaves. another urgent warning tone causes ock to look at the monitor screen. on it, flashing red, is the word, "overload!" ock pushes the red power throttle forward! the whine increases to a pulse and throb.}
