<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i guess i will try to back it out on the rim... at least to the main road.}
<C>__{baby}
<D>__{if you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate... it's easier.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{just back up.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{i think we should go straight. i mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?}
<C>__{baby}
<D>__{oh wait! i love this song!}
<A>__{baby reaches over and turns up the volume. she loudly sings along with the song.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{fine. i will go straight.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{what!}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(over the loud music)}
<D>__{fine! i will go straight!}
<A>__{the car moves forward. after about fifty yards the car hits something hard and gets stuck in a deep mud bog.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{fuck! we are fucked!}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{turn that fucking radio off!}
<A>__{bill shuts off the radio.}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{now what are we gonna do?}
<C>__{baby}
<D>__{we can walk to my house from here. my brother's got a tow truck, he can come get your car.}
<A>__{a silence falls over the car.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i think i'm going fucking crazy.}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{i can't believe...}

<C>__{bill}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{jerry}
