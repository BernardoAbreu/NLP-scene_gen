<L>__{interior church sanctuary day}
<A>__{a largish room, no exposed windows, everything boarded up. newly constructed makeshift toilet and shower in one corner, various cots. a number of latin refugees families mostly react shyly as father genarro introduces nico and jackson. sister bonifacia is there, and a youthful priest, father tomassino. we will see both of them again.}
<C>__{father genarro}
<P>__{(referring to the cops)}
<D>__{these are friends.}
<P>__{(to nico)}
<D>__{this is father tomassino.}
<C>__{father tomassino}
<D>__{how do you do?}
<A>__{nico shakes the young priest's hand. there is a moment between them as nico meets tomassino's eyes, liking what he sees. the refugees are relieved, however, when father genarro, nico and jackson take their leave. nico, jackson and father genarro continue down the hall.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{i didn't know this church was a sanctuary, father.}
<C>__{father genarro}
<D>__{yes. but, perhaps not such a safe one.}
<C>__{nico}
<D>__{how long have they been here?}
<C>__{father genarro}
<D>__{too long. at least the kids can go to our school.}
<C>__{nico}
<D>__{who did it, father?}
<C>__{father genarro}
<D>__{kids, maybe.}
<P>__{(significantly)}
<D>__{maybe worse. it's not the first time.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{we can have a car check by, every hour.}
<C>__{father genarro}
<D>__{no... please. police frighten these people.}
