<L>__{interior soft shoulder's van (flashback) night}
<A>__{jennifer is crouched in the back of the van. none of the band members are speaking. nikolai wolf drives down a gravel road, away from the fire site and deep into the woods.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{guys? where are we going?}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{shut your mouth, object.}
<C>__{dirk}
<P>__{(nervously)}
<D>__{nikolai...}
<A>__{jennifer looks around the van, wide eyed. there's glow in the dark satanic imagery painted all over the walls: goats heads, pentagrams, and strange coded writing. she sees a few books sliding around on the floor: "spells and incantations," "summoning the beast," and a copy of the black mass. jennifer springs to her feet and tries to escape out the side door. mick, the drummer, grabs her ankles, taking her down.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{are you guys rapists?!}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{you wish.}
<A>__{jennifer struggles again, but mick holds her down.}
<C>__{mick}
<P>__{(to band members)}
<D>__{hey guys? do we even know if she's a virgin?}
<A>__{a glint of hope in jennifer's eyes. maybe if she lies she can save herself.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{yes...yes! of course i'm a virgin! i've never done sex ever. i don't even know how. so maybe you should find some other girl who does. know how.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{told you, dirk. you owe me a beer.}
<C>__{dirk}
<P>__{(preoccupied)}
<D>__{sure, man.}
