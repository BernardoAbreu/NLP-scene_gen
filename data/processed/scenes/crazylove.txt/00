<L>__{interior bedroom apartment day}
<A>__{the sweet silence of slumber. suddenly, an alarm clock on a nightstand shrieks the operatic tones of maria callas. a well manicured hand, nails painted pink, slaps the snooze button and mutes maria. a few seconds reprieve. then, another clock, stationed on a dresser, broadcasts the fortissimo pounding of the "william tell overture." toes, also painted pink, swing out of bed and run to the dresser. letty mayer, late 20s and beautiful, turns off the music. she opens a dresser drawer and surveys panties that are arranged by color, from white to beige to black. behind the panties are rows of bras, also organized by color. letty pulls out some taupe undergarments, checks them against her nails and replaces them in favor of a pink bra and panties. letty goes to her closet and removes a tailored, pink linen suit. she lays it on the bed. beast, her cat, jumps on the bed and settles into the jacket. letty swoops the animal off her clothes and brushes cat hair from the suit.}

<D>__{listen, beast. what have i told you about linen?}
<A>__{the scolding is cut short by an "urge overkill" song that screams out from another room. on cue, letty heads down the hall, dressing as she goes. she clucks for beast to follow.}
