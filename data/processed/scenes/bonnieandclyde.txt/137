<A>__{clyde gets the pointerior for the very first time we see clyde, the leader, helpless as he hangs onto the running board.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(lamely)}
<D>__{...well, where do you think she could've gone?...buck?...buck?}
<C>__{buck}
<P>__{(amazed and a little frightened)}
<D>__{jesus, i don't know...}
<A>__{clyde looks helplessly at his brother, then drops off the running board and continues on foot, running along, scanning the fields the car keeping up beside him as he runs and we truck before both car and clyde. angle on car through windshield. reaction shot. day. buck turning to blanche, shrugging his shoulders, speechless. reverse angle through the windshield. day at clyde, who has suddenly seen something begins gesticulating wildly, almost from car's pov, a little comically.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{there! there! there!}
<A>__{he starts running off into a cornfield. another angle picking up clyde as he kicks his way into the cornfield, knees pumping high, knocking down the stalks. he stops and picks up the stocking he had spotted, takes it and moves on. still another angle as clyde has picked up a freshly beaten trail through the cornfield. he picks up one of bonnie's scarves, now. as he runs on, he clears a knoll and bonnie, her yellow hair unmistakable even at this distance, comes into view. she's far off in the cornfield, stalking off, looking neither to right nor left, carrying a brown paper sack that has split, from which she has occasionally lost clothing. clyde screams, "bonnie." she apparently doesn't hear. angle on cornfield. day. as clyde gets closer. bonnie herself suddenly breaks into flight, the paper bag splitting completely, the remaining clothes spilling out. there is a real chase where they each try to get the advantage. clyde is so exhausted from his run that he has real trouble cornering her as they maneuver up and down the rows of corn. finally clyde catches up. extreme close up. bonnie & clyde. day. as they tumble into the stalks of corn, mowing them down.}

<D>__{leave me alone! leave me alone!}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(holding her, kissing her frantically)}
<D>__{hey...hey, hey, baby, hey, bonnie, hey baby...}
<P>__{(calming her down)}
<D>__{...hey, hey now...just where did you think you were goin'?...}
<A>__{bonnie doesn't answer. up angle. pov clyde. as he's momentarily distracted by buck's laughter as he's in the cornfield picking up bonnie's clothing. clyde waves an impatient it's all right wave. he turns back to bonnie who he still holds tightly.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(still frantic)}
<D>__{ huh. bonnie? where? where?}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{i don't know! you're hurting me, i was just scared is all...and my mama's been on my mind, and she's gettin' so old...}
<A>__{bonnie hesitates, beginning to feel a little foolish now.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{boy, don't ever leave without sayin' somethin'. you really scared me, bonnie.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{but i mean it, though. i want to see my mama. please, clyde.}
