<A>__{a popular song rocks the gymnasium. cheerleaders dance on the sidelines. students and parents cheer wildly from the packed stands. julie gabs with a group of teachers. on one end of the court, the falcons run a pass and shoot drill. on the opposite end, a team in blue shoots around. mike sees scarlet and maggie enter. he smiles apologetically to them. both turn away, climb the bleachers, join nicole and the wonder bras.}
