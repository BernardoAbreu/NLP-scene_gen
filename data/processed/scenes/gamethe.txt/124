<A>__{more graffiti everywhere: "fuck the police," "sore loser!," "no future," "crs rules," assorted obscenities. boom, as schuyler moves through the living room, contact explosives on the floor explode beneath his feet, making him leap and dance. over the mantlepiece, a note is stuck into a painting with a kitchen knife. schuyler approaches and rips this down. insert note, pan down slowly, x close: "like my father before me, i kill what i love. goodbye, cruel world, blah blah blah..." a red signature arrow is affixed by a dotted line at the bottom, "please sign here." schuyler groans and crumples the note. he reaches for a phone he picks up the receiver, it's been melted into the body of the telephone. he throws it aside. he hears voices from the next room, enters cautiously, picking up a small sculpture as a weapon lolc(new). i n t . s c h u y l e r ' s s t u d y d a y the television is on, playing a silly looking cartoon. action heros fly through the air, shooting light from their eyeballs, etc. schuyler lowers his weapon, moves to shut off the tube. more grafitti over the walls, the books, etc.: stick figure drawings of a man hanging himself, a broken heart, a penis, a naked woman, etc. across the walls, over the tv, are the words, "you are not alone." schuyler presses the on off switch nothing happens.}
<C>__{action hero }
<D>__{don't touch that dial, sky!}
<A>__{on screen, the masked action hero stands proudly, hands on hips, before a colorful moving background. it speaks in a cheezy he man voice, an animated mouth. there's a crs logo on its chest.}
<P>__{crs man (on tv)}
<D>__{boy oh boy, you fucked up big time! bringing in the cops real mistake!}
<A>__{schuyler covers his eyes, leans against a chair; this is too much.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{no no no }
<P>__{crs man (on tv)}
<D>__{oh you're always so negative...}
<A>__{schuyler realizes this is a two way conversation as the crs man winks at him, making a stiff wave.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{you people are insane...}
<P>__{crs man (on tv)}
<D>__{hey, look who's talking to their tv set.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{how did you do this, how did you get in here?}
<P>__{crs man (on tv)}
<D>__{simple, we duped your keys the day you came in for your physical, wired the whole house while you were at work. you rich people all have alarms, but you never set 'em, do you?}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{look, at least leave my brother alone, he's fragile enough as it is }
<P>__{crs man (on tv)}
<D>__{don't worry about him, he's just playing his own game at a more advanced level, you might say...}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{you can't just fuck with people like this, you don't know who you're dealing with!}
<P>__{crs man (on tv) (laughs)}
<D>__{we know exactly who we're dealing with, that's the whole idea! for a guy with your test scores, you're pretty slow on the uptake.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{what the fuck do you want from me?!}
<P>__{crs man (on tv)}
<D>__{sky, i just came to say good bye... too bad it didn't work out, better luck next time. uh, there might be a few loose ends for you to tie up, but remember it's not whether you win or lose that counts, it's how you play the game... ya big loser you...}
<A>__{the screen implodes as schuyler smashes it with the sculpture }
<P>__{crs man (filter)}
<D>__{ouch! take it easy, my hot headed friend!}
<A>__{schuyler peers into the smoking electronics, pulls out a battery pack, a small video camera, a loop antenna; the speaker's not dead.}
<P>__{crs man (filter)}
<D>__{holy smoke, this was an expensive tv }
<A>__{he bashes the equipment repeatedly on the floor with all his might. the speaker sputters out, the crs man's voice at last silenced. the phone has started ringing during the above. schuyler, breathless, moves around the room now, trying to find it. he finally tracks it down in the bottom of a garbage can, covered with disgusting slime which he wipes on his shirt.}
<C>__{schuyler }
<D>__{now what?!}
<C>__{manager }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{is this schuyler van orton?}

<D>__{yeah, who's this?}
<C>__{manager }
<D>__{i'm calling from the claremont hotel in berkeley... we have your american express card, you left it at the check in desk...}
<C>__{schuyler }
<D>__{what? that's impossible, i've never stayed there }
<C>__{manager }
