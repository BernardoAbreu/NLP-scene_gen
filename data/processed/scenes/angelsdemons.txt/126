<L>__{ext piazza navona night}
<A>__{ bernini's spectacular fountain of the four rivers in the piazza navona. there is a black van parked beside the fountain, and we drift over toward it. passing through the passenger window, we go inside to find mr. gray, facing the rear of the van, his jacket off and his shirt open, engaged in battlefield surgery on his injured right shoulder. using a long handled tweezers, he digs into his own flesh, gets a hold of the bullet that pierced him, and tosses it onto the metal floor of the van with a ting. it lands beside a lumpy tarp, and as metal hits metal, the tarp jumps. there's a human being in there. mr. gray speaks to the lump.}
<C>__{mr. gray}
<D>__{were it up to me, it would not be this way. it is a sin to kill with pain.}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{but i am a sinner.}
<A>__{we pan off him quickly and look out the driver's window, up at a clock tower on the far side of the plaza. it's sixteen minutes to eleven.}
