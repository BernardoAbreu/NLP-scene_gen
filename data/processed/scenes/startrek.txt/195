<A>__{ but now, facing him, is the narada.}
<C>__{spock prime }
<D>__{nero was waiting for me.}
<L>__{interior cave day}
<A>__{kirk inhales, sharply, having been there with spock prime. back to the two men, in a cave: kirk stares at him... his mind spinning because now he believes him. the result is overwhelmingly emotional.}
<C>__{spock prime}
<D>__{forgive me... emotional transference is an effect of the mind meld.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(sympathy, surprise)}
<D>__{... so you do feel...}
<C>__{spock prime}
<D>__{"cthia" is the stricture that binds our emotions... but few of us are that perfectly vulcan.}
<A>__{kirk gathers himself, wipes his eyes on his sleeve...}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{going back in time... you changed all our lives.}
<C>__{spock prime}
<D>__{yet remarkably, events within our timelines, characteristics, people... seem to overlap significantly. tell me about the rest of the crew? chekov uhura ?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{tactical and communications }
<C>__{spock prime}
<D>__{ sulu }
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{ he's the helmsman, why?}
<C>__{spock prime}
<D>__{dr. mccoy would assert our meeting here is not a matter of coincidence... but rather, indication of a higher purpose.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{... he'd call it a damn miracle.}
<C>__{spock prime}
<D>__{yes he would. perhaps the time stream's way of attempting to mend itself. in both our histories, the same crew found its way onto the same ship in a time of ultimate crisis therein lies our advantage.}
<P>__{(rises)}
<D>__{we must go there's a starfleet outpost not far from here.}
<A>__{but kirk stands stops him:}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{where you came from... did i know my father?}
<C>__{spock prime}
<D>__{... yes. you often spoke of him as your inspiration for joining starfleet.}
<A>__{this is amazing for kirk he looks off, trying to imagine that life. spock intuits what this means.}
<C>__{spock prime }
<D>__{you should know. he proudly lived to see you become captain of the enterprise.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{... captain?}
<C>__{spock prime}
<D>__{a ship we must return you to as soon as possible.}
