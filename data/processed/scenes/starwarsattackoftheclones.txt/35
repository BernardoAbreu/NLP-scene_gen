<A>__{the starfreighter lands in the giant port city of theed. padme, anakin and artoo are among the emigrants streaming from the starfreighter and into the vast docking area. they exit onto the main plaza.}
<L>__{exterior naboo palace, grand courtyard (naboo) afternoon}
<A>__{the speeder bus pulls up and stops. padme, anakin, and artoo get out. the great courtyard stretches out before them, and they see the rose colored dome of the palace on the far side. artoo whistles. they pick up their gear and start to cross the courtyard. artoo trundles behind them.}

<D>__{if i grew up here, i don't think i'd ever leave.}
<C>__{padme}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{i doubt that.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{no, really. when i started my training, i was very homesick and very lonely. this city and my mom were the only pleasant things i had to think about... the problem was, the more i thought about my mom, the worse i felt. but i would feel better if i thought about the palace the way it shimmers in the sunlight the way the air always smells of flowers...}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{...and the soft sound of the distant waterfalls. the first time i saw the capital, i was very young... i'd never seen a waterfall before. i though they were so beautiful... i never dreamed one day i'd live in the palace.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{well, tell me, did you dream of power and politics when you were a little girl?}
<C>__{padme}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{no! that was the last thing i thought of. my dream was to help in the "refugee relief movement." i never thought of running for elected office. but the more history i studied, the more i realised how much good politicians could do. so when i was eight, i joined the "apprentice legislators", then later on became a senatorial advisor, with such a passion that, before i knew it, i was elected queen. partly because i scored so high on my education certificate, but for the most part it was my conviction that reform was possible. i wasn't the youngest queen ever elected, but now that i think back on it, i'm not sure i was old enough. i'm not sure i was ready.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{the people you served thought you did a good job. i heard they tried to amend the constitution so you could stay in office.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{popular rule is not democracy, annie. it gives the people what they want, not what they need. and, truthfully, i was relieved when my two terms were up. so were my parents. they worried about me during the blockade and couldn't wait for it all to be over. actually, i was hoping to have a family by now... my sisters have the most amazing, wonderful kids... but when the queen asked me to serve as senator, i couldn't refuse her.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{i agree! i think the republic needs you... i'm glad you chose to serve. i feel things are going to happen in our generation that will change the galaxy in profound ways.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{i think so too.}
<A>__{anakin and padme walk toward the palace. artoo continues to follow.}
