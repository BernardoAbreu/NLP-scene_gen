<L>__{exterior richard scruggs' house, pascagoula, mississippi day}
<A>__{a white, traditional, southern house, with a veranda and gables...a large front lawn with weeping willows. and we see lowell, hands in his pockets, not an insider or an outsider, waiting alone on the expansive lawn. the front door opens. a mississippi state trooper, putting on his round brimmed hat comes out and crosses the driveway. then jeffrey coming out with motley. motley talks to him on the veranda for a moment and then heads towards his car. meanwhile, jeffrey comes down over to lowell on the lawn. and jeffrey looks off, across the street from the house, at the gulf. and we see the street is blockaded by mississippi state police cars. an armed camp. other men in suits, lawyers and state officials, wait. ron motley gets in his car and drives away.}

<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{i don't know what to do.}
<A>__{and they're quiet, a breeze of the gulf ruffling their coats... he looks out at the water, a cargo container ship passing by. he watches its slow progress... and jeffrey quietly starts to walk off across the lawn, hands in his pockets, shoulders bent, head down, thinking... and richard scruggs comes out, tying his tie, to wait beside lowell...}
