<A>__{buggy, in his ill fitting rhinette costume, emerges from the sub basement carrying a thin suitcase. as far as anyone's concerned, he's just another usher. he heads for the stairwell.}
<L>__{interior madison square garden continuous action}
<A>__{every seat in the arena is occupied. the lights are lowered. a slow rolling tympany is heard. after a moment, the rhinettes skate out to enthusiastic applause.}

<A>__{sheldon, looking very intense, stands alone in the wings. he takes a couple of deep breaths. we tilt down and see the bulge of the revolver under his smoochy costume.}
<B>__{ice rink}
<A>__{the rhinettes have formed a line across the middle of the rink.}
<C>__{announcer }
<D>__{and now... it gives us great pleasure to introduce america's favorite rhino... ladies and gentlemen... boys and girls...}
<P>__{(dramatic pause)}
<D>__{heeeeere's smoochy!}
<A>__{smoochy skates out to thunderous applause. the entire arena is on its feet. the rhinettes part as smoochy skates through them and stops in the middle of the rink. the applause and cheering don't stop for several moments. one of the rhinettes hands smoochy a microphone.}
<C>__{smoochy}
<D>__{on behalf of myself, the rhinettes, and the soon to be restored coney island methadone center, i thank you all for coming.}

<A>__{burke and stokes roll their eyes.}
<B>__{back on sheldon}
<C>__{smoochy}
<D>__{it was my original intention that tonight's performance would be a benign mix of smoochy songs and ice dancing. but as an artist, i believe i must convey to you, my fans, what i'm feeling at any given moment in my life. to do otherwise would be dishonest. art is communication. it's something we learn and hopefully grow from. with that in mind... i hope you enjoy the show.}
<A>__{more applause as smoochy skates over to the rhinettes. they form a circle around him and slap hands in solidarity.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{this is for spinner.}
<A>__{the lights go down. a full orchestra begins to play the overture to wagner's tristen et isolde. the lights come up as a soprano a heavyset woman in a modified rhino costume skates out through the fog and begins singing the opera. smoochy now wearing a peasant's frock skates an interpretive dance in the b.g. with a few rhinettes who are also dressed as peasants. a beautiful fairy princess floats down (on filament wire) from the rafters and takes smoochy's hand. she skates away with him as he waves good bye to the rhinettes.}

<A>__{looking down at the opera. the camera pans over to the catwalk high above the rink.}

<A>__{buggy ding dong, still in his rhinette costume, settles into his assassin's roost. he begins to assemble the rifle and check the scope.}
