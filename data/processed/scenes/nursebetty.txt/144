<A>__{a long beat passes. police sirens wail in the distance. betty moves close to charlie to look at his shoulder. he watches her intently.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{if we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i better go check on them.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{wait, betty... you still haven't answered me.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{this is really awkward...}
<A>__{the sirens are coming closer. he waves her off.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{ahh, it's too late, anyway. it's too late.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{listen, i could shoot my way out, maybe take one of them with me... if you'd gimme my gun back.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i'd rather not...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{betty, i don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. no way. i've got some professional pride. and i don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{...what're you saying?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{when a roman general knew a battle was lost, he'd throw himself on his sword.}
<A>__{charlie fumbles in his pocket, then pulls out the photo of betty with the cardboard david ravell.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{did... did you really come here because you love this guy?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{yes... not the actor, though, the doctor. i think.}
<A>__{charlie's sinks slowly to the floor.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{so all this...really was because of that soap opera? my son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? a fake doctor?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{wesley didn't even want to come up here. he warned me, but i insisted...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i have to ask you, betty...are you crazy?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i don't think i am.}
<A>__{charlie remains sitting pensively for a long beat.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i want you to listen to me, betty. people don't lie when they're about to die.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you don't need that doctor. you don't need that actor. you don't need any man. it's not the forties, honey. you don't need anybody. you've got yourself... and that's more than most people can say.}
<A>__{charlie reaches out slowly and takes the gun from betty. she doesn't fight him. he kisses her hand and steps into the bathroom and closes the door. a single gunblast sends a shiver through betty.}
