<L>__{interior della's house kenneth's media room evening}
<A>__{we sneak between curtain and window ledge into a home office fitted out with a flat screen tv and a computer. kenneth, a forty something ex jock with a once handsome face, pours a beer into a crystal brandy glass. kenneth's eyes are glued to the computer screen where stock numbers scroll endlessly down. he highlights a set of numbers and stands up abruptly from his chair elated.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{yes!}
<A>__{steps back onto a a child's doll, crushing it underfoot. his ebullient mood changes quickly.}
<C>__{kenneth }
<D>__{damn! della!}
<A>__{the sound of footsteps are followed by the door opening. della peers into the room. she's a diminutive blonde in her thirties with fine features and a fading southern accent. she's pulling a coat on over a white shirt and jeans. she sees the broken doll.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{shoot, kenneth! that's tammi's favorite doll.}
<A>__{she walks in, picks up the doll and tries to fix its squashed face. he turns back to the computer guiltily, takes a sip of beer.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{you should just swear properly and get it over with. do you think the kids don't know what you mean?}
<A>__{close up, his face is ruddy the face of someone who drinks too much. he turns back towards her. she ignores him, continues to try fix the doll. his eyes linger on her coat.}
<C>__{kenneth }
<D>__{going out again? what is it tonight? auto mechanics for dummies? the bored housewives' reading group?}
<A>__{he averts his eyes back to the screen then turns back to look at her once more.}
<C>__{kenneth }
<D>__{i got a new one for you.}
<A>__{he smiles sardonically.}
<C>__{kenneth }
<D>__{group therapy for women who always have the curse. there's a tuesday night class at the pleasant valley episcopalian.}
<A>__{kenneth clearly thinks he's funny. della glares a warning at him and bites her lip to stop a vitriolic response escaping from her mouth.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{i'm going to the mall for wrapping paper.}
<A>__{a trail of kids mess in the hallway behind della catches kenneth's eye.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{what do you do all day, della honey? cause it sure isn't keeping house. this place is an eyesore. i'm mortgaged up to the eyeballs for this?}
<A>__{his sad eyes meet hers in confrontation. della, determined not to engage, averts hers. kenneth, unable to contain himself, faces her.}
<C>__{kenneth }
<D>__{i mean it's not like you're at some salon fancying up your hair or nails like the other men's wives.}
<A>__{he lifts a strand of her limp fair hair and lets it drop, looks right in her tired face.}
<C>__{kenneth }
<D>__{the last time i saw you wearing something sexy was our engagement party. god, della, you used to be hot!}
<A>__{she bites her lip again, but this time to try stop the tears. he turns away, in an attempt to conceal his own sadness. she walks away clutching the doll.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{put the twins to bed by eight. give them a chocolate cookie with their milk.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{jesus, della. della honey, i'm sorry.}
<A>__{but she's already left the room. he watches her pick up a set of car keys from a dresser in the dimly lit hallway. her knuckles are white as she clenches her fingers around them. kenneth turns back to his computer.}
