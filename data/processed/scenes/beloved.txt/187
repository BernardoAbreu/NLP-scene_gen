<L>__{interior 124 bluestone road night.}
<A>__{paul d. sits at the kitchen table. the story told. sethe looks out the window...and waits..}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{your love is too thick, sethe.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{love is or it isn't. thin love ain't love at all...i did stop him. i took and put my babies where they'd be safe...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{didn't work though, did it?}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{it worked.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{how? your boys gone, you don't know where. one girl dead, the other can't go farther than the yard. how did it work?}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{they ain't at sweet home! schoolteacher ain't got'em!}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{maybe there's worse.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{it ain't my job to know what's worse. it's my job to know what is and keep them away from what i know is terrible. i did that.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what you did was wrong, sethe.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{i should have gone back there? taken my babies back there?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{there could have been a way. some other way.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{what way?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you got two feet, sethe. not four!}
<A>__{that jumped out before he had a chance to choose saying it. sethe has no response...the distance between these two people in this small room is suddenly vast. paul rises, playing with his hat...not knowing how to leave. but desperately needing to. he moves to the exit and stops..}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you can set aside supper for me... might be late getting back...}
<A>__{unable to look at her, he turns to exit. when sethe speaks in a soft, forgiving tone, he stops to listen;}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{after all i told you, paul d. and after telling me how many feet i have, you think saying goodbye is gonna break me into pieces?}
<A>__{paul turns to look at her and realizes she saw right through him...}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{you're a sweet man.}
<A>__{unable to bear it, paul turns and leaves... sethe stands still, fighting tears, and whispers...}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{so long, paul d.}
