<L>__{exterior bones' building later day}
<A>__{the cop we saw with jeremiah, lupovich, and the wannabe player eddie mack (wearing an old superfly suit, and sleek black driving gloves) pull up in front of the old stone building.}
<L>__{interior bones' pad continuous}
<A>__{shotgun mixes drinks at the bar and hands them to the just arrived guests, jeremiah, officer lupovich looking stiff in plain clothes and eddie mack in his purple suit.}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{hey jimmy, you know eddie mack, don't you?}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{we met.}
<C>__{mack}
<D>__{yeah, we used to do the after school b ball at kenwood. what it is?}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{what it will be.}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{and officer lupovich.}
<A>__{bones says nothing. just nods at the cop.}
<C>__{mack}
<D>__{you got a nice crib here.}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{i do alright. everybody's happy.}
<C>__{mack}
<D>__{but things change. you gotta think ahead.}
<C>__{lupovich}
<D>__{they got lotteries all over now, bonesy. coming here too, maybe next year.}
<A>__{bones' look sez: bitch, don't call me that again.}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{half our old customers are gonna be getting their people to cross state lines to pick up lotto tickets.}
<C>__{mack}
<D>__{besides, there's more money to be made in the gin than the juice. what do anybody want with numbers anyway?}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{what else? money.}
<C>__{mack}
<D>__{it ain't the money it's the high. the big fat floating 'what if?' and it's way more profitable. nobody ever wins. so you never have to pay out.}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{but a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty dollar bag.}
<C>__{mack}
<D>__{yeah, but i ain't talking horse. i'm talking about a five dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. and the fools keep coming back for more.}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{those 'fools' are my people.}
<C>__{mack}
<D>__{ain't no big thang. it's just a po' man's free base. here, check it out.}
<A>__{eddie pulls a little rock of crack out. jimmy takes it in his hand and sniffs it. then shrugs and hands it back.}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{i ain't interested. and if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.}
<C>__{mack}
<D>__{just try it.}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{i said, no thanks.}
<C>__{mack}
<D>__{go on. it won't kill you.}
<C>__{shotgun}
<D>__{back off, huggybear...}
<C>__{mack}
<D>__{it's like this, jimmy. there's a wave coming. a big ass krakatoa, east of java wave. and either you gonna be on top of the wave up there in chocolate heaven, or you gonna be buried 'neath the muddy undertow.}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{that's cool. totally wide screen sci fi. forward thinking. i respect that. but that ain't my life. i'm here and now. comfortable as a bed bug on a cold night in a warm nappy dugout. i'm maintaining. that's what it's about for me. and your twelve and a half minutes is up.}
<A>__{jimmy just walks away from him. meeting over. eddie and lupovich and jeremiah all look at each other, frustrated.}
<C>__{mack}
<D>__{fine. let's go, loopy lou. jimmy ain't into it. gonna skip the money train and take the bus. his loss.}
<A>__{lupovich turns but then spins back around with a .45 in his hand and it's pointed at jimmy's forehead. jeremiah didn't expect this or did he?}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{everybody just be cool. jimmy, man, i think you oughtta hear the deal.}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{i don't need to hear the deal. i don't need any partners. i don't need new product. and i sure as hell don't need this motherfucker's 'mattie in my face.}
<C>__{mack}
<D>__{just try it, jimmy. that's all...}
<A>__{he hands him the rock. and a little pipe.}
<C>__{lupovich}
<D>__{you heard the man. try it.}
<A>__{bones keeps his eye on him as he lights the lighter and takes a deep puff. then lets out a deep cloud of smoke. his eyes go a bit glazed. and from his pov we see the room start to tilt on its axis as everything goes wobbly. just then, the door opens and pearl steps in, distracting lupovich for an instant. in one eternal crack fueled fast and slo mo second: jimmy sees his chance, he pulls his razor, but too slow lupovich turns, the razor no more than lightly slices his arm, and he pulls the trigger on jimmy bones... pumping three shots into jimmy's abdomen, knocking him to the ground. shotgun grabs his gun, but too late. he's covered.}
<C>__{mack}
<D>__{ain't worth it, blood. just drop it. and kick it here.}
<A>__{pearl in screaming shock. her lover bleeding on the carpet.}
<C>__{lupovich}
<D>__{tell her to stop screaming.}
<A>__{bones is bleeding, and still tripping bad.}
<C>__{lupovich }
<D>__{i said stop that bitch screaming or i will spread her like butter.}
<A>__{shotgun gently puts his hand on pearl's mouth to quiet her. back in bones' fucked up pov: looking down he sees his own blood pouring out, a thick divine river of many colors. looking up, they all stand wavering above him, hungry demons, their voices distorting.}
<C>__{lupovich }
<D>__{get his razor. i ain't gonna be the only one with this nigger's blood on my hands.}
<A>__{mack plucks bone's silver razor right out of his hands.}
<C>__{lupovich }
<D>__{take the gloves off. everybody leaves a printerior we hang out together. or we hang separately. cut him. and cut him good.}
<A>__{eddie pulls his glove off and enjoys himself as he shoves the razor into jimmy.}
<C>__{mack}
<D>__{what it is? what it will be, muthafucka.}
<C>__{lupovich}
<D>__{now you.}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{no way man...}
<C>__{lupovich}
<D>__{you cut him, or i shoot you. make your choice.}
<A>__{jeremiah gets down near bones. bones stares right into his eyes, as his life blood pours freely, weakly lifts his arm to his best friend's face.}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{jay bird...help me...like brothers.}
<A>__{jeremiah feels lupovich's gun behind his head. hears it cocked.}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{sorry, my brother.}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{since we was just grasshoppers...}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{you always told me, it's a dog eat dog world.}
<A>__{and he thrusts bones' razor right between the ribs. bones' eyes tighten, but never lose their lock on jeremiah's eyes. his mouth moves as if he's trying to speak. instead, he spits a bog of blood right into jeremiah's face. a shaken jeremiah hands the bloody razor to shotgun.}
<C>__{jeremiah }
<D>__{just do it. he won't even feel it.}
<A>__{bones' eyes bore into shotgun's. shotgun hesitates. eyeing his gun on the floor, feeling the one on the back of his neck calculating his chances. then shotgun slices him. bones flinches, he definitely still feels it. shotgun hands the razor back to eddie.}
<C>__{lupovich}
<D>__{now you, girlie.}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{i won't.}
<C>__{lupovich}
<D>__{same deal all around. or die with him.}
<A>__{she takes the razor and slowly kneels beside her dying lover. her hands trembling. there's no way she can do it. lupovich brings the gun to the back of her head.}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{i can't. i won't. go ahead. shoot me. i will be better off.}
<A>__{bones reaches one hand round the back of her neck, weakly storking her there... and with his other hand, bones takes her wrists and pulls her hand towards him, burying his razor in his heart. his eyes roll back and his hand falls away and he's gone. she drops her hand from the razor which remains sticking out of his chest, a river of blood pouring from around it.}
<B>__{bones pov}
<A>__{as his spirit rises and rises, up to the ceiling, looking down on them as they stand watching his body bleed to death. pearl just stands there completely covered in his blood. then in a frantic daze tears her dress off. jeremiah gently takes her bloody dress. from above, bones can hear them speaking below, but it's as if they were speaking far away.}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{too risky to take him outside. take him down to the storm cellar and bury him. and get rid of this too.}
<P>__{(tosses pearl's bloody dress)}
<D>__{let this whole damn building be his tomb.}
<A>__{shotgun and lupovich drag bones' body out of the room, leaving behind a deep wet blood stain in the shag carpet.}
<B>__{bones pov}
<A>__{as he stares down in horror at all this. above him, it seems he can see right through the ceiling to the night sky, and a swirling light opening above his head.}
<B>__{now his pov}
<A>__{is floating upward towards the light, but then he looks}
