<L>__{interior entry floor night}
<A>__{burnham races down the steps, hurries to the entry door, throws it open and finds a gun barrel pointed directly into his nose. he blinks, tries to focus on whoever's on the other end of that gun. it's the cop, the first cop, the one who came to the door and was so suspicious of meg. the cop looks down, sees blood smeared all over burnham's jacket, sees more than enough to know his suspicions were correct.}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{put your hands up.}
<A>__{burnham freezes, silhouetted in the doorway. wind and leaves blow into the house, a real gale outside. from behind cop 1, more cops shout, all at once, must be a half dozen of 'em there, but burnham can't see anything in the stinging light, and can't hear much either, over the roaring wind. burnham moves suddenly, flinging the door shut right in the cop's face. the door slams hard, burnham turns to run but doesn't get more than a few paces before three sharp gunshots crack through the door behind him. brilliant white light spills through the bulletholes in the door, but it's not the light that gets you, it's the chunks of lead. they rip through burnham's back and come out his chest, a triangle pattern. burnham stops, sags to his knees. he reaches into his jacket, pulls out the loose stack of bonds. he fans them out, stares down at them, holds them like playing cards.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{monster hand.}
<A>__{behind him, the front door cracks open, half a dozen cops appear and start shouting, all at once. burnham tosses the bonds to the floor, the same gesture as folding a hand of poker. he groans and collapses, slowly, falling through the bonds, twisting as he goes down. he slaps onto his back in the foyer as the wind gusts through the open door, scoops the bonds up off the floor, and blows them back into the house, as if they were never meant to leave. burnham lies there on the floor, eyes open, staring up at the ceiling, looking at the bonds that swirl in the blast of air, suspended there, twisting and bucking and diving just over his head as he dies.}
