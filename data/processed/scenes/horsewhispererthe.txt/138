<L>__{exterior double divide day}
<A>__{the truck is parked at the foot of a mountain. grace, very pleased with herself, sits beside tom on the cab's roof, looking around them at the great montana. after a beat;}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{where did you get pilgrim from?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{we bought him in kentucky. my mother and i took a trip down there to see him.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{that must have been pretty special.}
<A>__{grace nods. it is a pleasant memory. he motions for her to be quiet. an old elk with a prodigious rack of antlers, has come down out of the mountains. seeing them, he stops in his tracks, dead still. they watch each other. then the elk turns and runs back up into the mountains. tom smiles at grace who smiles back partly because of the elk, partly because she's alone with tom.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{are you afraid of anything?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{getting old. not being of much use, i guess.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what went on out there, grace? with pilgrim?}
<A>__{grace doesn't say anything. tom nods then;}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you see, grace, i've got a problem. when i'm working with a horse, i like to know its history. now, most times, the horse can tell you pretty much the whole story, but sometimes he can be so messed up in his head that you need more to go on. you need to know exactly what went wrong. often times, it's the obvious thing, but something that went wrong just before that, maybe even some little thing...}
<A>__{grace is quiet. she doesn't want to think about that.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{it's like if i'm driving and run into a tree. when somebody asks me, "well, what happened?", i don't say, "well, i plowed into a tree." i'd say, "the sun was in my eyes." or "i skidded." or "i took my mind off the road for a second." see what i mean?}
<P>__{(grace nods)}
<D>__{i don't know how you feel about talking about it and i can understand you might not want to. but if i'm going to figure out what's going on in his head, it'd sure help if i knew exactly what happened that day.}
<A>__{grace looks away. tom smiles and gently puts his arm around her shoulders, which has a soothing effect on grace making her feel safe...}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{not today whenever you feel like it. i leave it up to you.}
<A>__{grace looks into tom's eyes, wanting so much to unburden herself to him and have him make everything all right. she nods.}
