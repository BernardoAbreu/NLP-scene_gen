<L>__{interior ranch house kitchen night}
<A>__{everyone sits around the kitchen table. joe, still wearing his hat, eyes annie and grace with acute curiosity.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{joe, take off the hat i'm not going to say it again.}
<A>__{joe obeys. diane puts the last of the serving plates on the table pork chops, potatoes, gravy, peas, bread... and a big bowl of mixed salad. the boy can't help eyeing how the "vegetarians" will act. annie and grace eye the food. annie reaches out for a serving ladle, picking up grace's plate to serve her as grace reaches for a piece of bread, when:}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{dear lord, we are humbly thankful for...}
<A>__{annie and grace freeze as frank continues his prayer they notice everyone's head bowed slightly.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continues)}
<D>__{these gifts. for the blessings on our home, our family and our guests. bless those that aren't as fortunate. bless all god's creatures.}
<C>__{everyone}
<D>__{amen.}
<A>__{everyone begins eating. annie and grace breath a sigh of relief. silence. utensils hitting plates, the only sound.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{we should be fine, then.}
<A>__{beat. annie and grace listen...}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{teacher asked me why we raise black angus herefords 'stead of pure herefords.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{tell her they suit the weather better. their udders are black, 'stead of pink.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{they don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. and they're good mother.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{our daddy raised pure herefords.}
<A>__{silence... eating... annie tries her hand at conversation:}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{you know, that's interesting. i always wondered when i went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a black angus steak. i couldn't taste any difference although i could swear one was more tender. i didn't know there was that big a difference between cows...}
<P>__{(silence)}
<D>__{i've never been on a cow farm before. i must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to...}
<P>__{(uncomfortable)}
<D>__{do their... work.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger. on a balance i reckon i'd choose being a cow.}
<P>__{(to grace)}
<D>__{would you mind passing that salad young lady?}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{how's peterson's holding up for you?}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(lying)}
<D>__{it's fine. comfortable. i still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. when we leave the ranch, i always hold my breath until i can see the motel.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(innocently)}
<D>__{you know, tom, while you're working on that horse of theirs, annie and grace should move into the old creek house.}
<A>__{diane and tom react accordingly; diane hiding her annoyance, tom hiding his surprise and pleasure.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{nobody's using it. silly for her to be driving back and forth when she don't know her way around that well...}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{oh, i don't know...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{well, i know peterson's. old place is as good as falling down around your ears.}
<C>__{diane}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{they're already all settled in, frank. anyway, i'm sure annie wants her privacy.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it's got doors, diane. private as can be. tom?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i don't have a problem with that. it's up to annie.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{well, it's worth it, really? i mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with pilgrim?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{that's up to pilgrim.}
<A>__{everyone waits on annie's answer as she considers this.}
