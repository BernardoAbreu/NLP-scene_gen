<A>__{a107 exterior compound day later sarah and john have their weapons and supply selections laided out on two battered picnic tables for cleaning and packing. maps, radios, documents, explosives, detonators... just the basics. sarah is field stripping and cleaning guns, very methodical. there is no wasted motion. not far away, john and terminator are working on the bronco. they're greasy up to their elbows, lying on their backs under the engine compartment, ratcheting bolts into places on the new water pump.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{there was this one guy that was kinda cool. he taught me engines. hold this a second. mom screwed it up, of course. sooner or later she'd always tell them about judgment day and me being this world leader and that's be all she wrote.}
<A>__{john thinks he's being causal, but his longing for some kind of parental connection is obvious.}
<C>__{terminator}
<D>__{torque wrench please.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{here. i wish i coulda met my real dad.}
<C>__{terminator}
<D>__{you will.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{yeah. i guess so. my mom says when i'm, like, 45, i think, i send him back through time to 1984. but right now he hasn't even been born yet. man, is messes with your head. where's that other bolt?}
<P>__{(terminator hands it to him)}
<D>__{thanks. mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, i guess. i see her crying sometimes. she denies it totally, of course. like she says she got something in her eye.}
<A>__{they crawl out from under the truck into the bright sunlight.}
<C>__{terminator}
<D>__{why do you cry?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you mean people? i don't know. we just cry. you know. when it hurts.}
<C>__{terminator}
<D>__{pain causes it?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{uh unh, no, it's different... it's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway. you get it?}
<C>__{terminator}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{terminator gets into the bronco and turns the ignition key and the engine catches with a roar.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{alriight!! my man!}
<C>__{terminator}
<D>__{no problemo.}
<A>__{john grins and does a victorious thumbs up. terminator imitates the gesture awkwardly. john laughs and makes him get out of the truck, to try the move again. a108 sarah, across the compound, pauses in her work to watch john and terminator. a109 sarah's pov... we don't hear what john and terminator are saying. it is a soundless pantomime as john is trying to show some other gestures to the cyborg. trying to get him to walk more casually. john walks, then terminator tries it, then john gestures wildly, talking very fast... explaining the fundamental principles of cool. they try it again. continued ad lib as we hear:}
<C>__{sarah }
<D>__{watching john with the machine, it was suddenly so clear. the terminator would never stop, it would never leave him... it would always be there. and it would never hurt him, never shout at him or get drunk and hit him, or say it couldn't spend time with him because it was too busy. and it would die to protect him. of all the would be fathers who came and went over the years, this thing, this machine, was the only one who measured up. in an insane world, it was the sanest choice.}
<A>__{sarah clenches her jaw and goes grimly back to work... a strong woman made hard and cold by years of hard choices.}
