<A>__{clay crosses the patio, hurtles down the slope.}
<L>__{exterior whale's house pool day}
<A>__{clay leaps headfirst into the water. whale rests lightly on his back, with an upward sway of straight white hair. clay hauls the body toward the side.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{almost there. almost there.}
<A>__{he gets an arm around whale's chest and heaves the body over the curb. he climbs out, drags the body forward to rest in the grass. he grabs the wrist. nothing.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{son of a bitch. you crazy son of a bitch.}
<A>__{clay straddles whale's thighs and applies pressure on his rib cage. but it's no use. clay sits up and takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{ohhh!}
<A>__{hanna comes down the path, her run slowing to a walk. she stares at clay.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i didn't do it. this wasn't me.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{oh, mr. jimmy.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{he wanted me to kill him, but i didn't. he did it himself.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{he says here good bye. i find it in his room. he is sorry, he says. he has had a wonderful life.}
<A>__{she waves a folded piece of paper.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{you poor, foolish man. you couldn't wait for god to take you in his time?}
<A>__{clay slowly stands up. hanna looks around in panic.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{you must leave. you were not here this morning.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{but i didn't do this!}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{the police will not know that. they will want to investigate.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{we have his note.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{do you want to be questioned about you and mr. jimmy? please, clayton. it will be better if i find the body alone.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{but how're you going to explain this?}
<P>__{(points at the body)}
<D>__{how did you get him out of the pool?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{you are right. yes. we must put him back.}
<A>__{they both hesitate, looking down at whale. then clay drags the body parallel with the pool. hanna stoops over to adjust the collar of whale's shirt.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{poor mr. jimmy. we do not mean disrespect. you will keep better in water.}
<A>__{she nods to clay. he rolls the body over and it splashes on its belly. it bounces a moment in the waves of the splash, then begins to sink. as it drops, the air in the chest slowly flips the body around. looking up at them with open eyes, whale sinks backward into the thickening light. his arms trail upward and the hands lightly flutter as if waving good bye. the melancholy sound of a solo violin pierces the silence as we cut to:}
