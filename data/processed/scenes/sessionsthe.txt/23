<L>__{interior side chapel. day}
<A>__{mark and father brendan are huddled together in the little chapel.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{did she reciprocate your feelings?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{she didn't seem to.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<A>__{sometimes people can be very shy about their emotions.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{well, in case she didn't get it the first time, i told her again that i was in love with her, and wanted to marry her, thinking it might swing things.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{did it?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yes. she left.}
<A>__{they sit in silence for a while. father brendan seems to be at something of a loss.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{i wish i knew what to say. i mean, welcome to the human race. every day someone breaks someone else's heart. and as i said, i'm here for you. i just wish i had something more useful to offer. all i have are these vague ideas about life and death that priests are equipped with. have you ever thought of discussing your feelings with a therapist?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{not as yet. father, i think i need a hug.}
<A>__{after a moment of surprise, father brendan rises to the occasion. he seems to know how to move mark gently and efficiently. they hug.}
