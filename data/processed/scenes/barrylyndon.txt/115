<L>__{exterior beautiful garden early morning}
<A>__{roderick's sword duel with the count. details to be worked out.}
<L>__{interior billiard room night}
<A>__{roderick watches the chevalier play with a prussian officer, lieutenant dascher.}
<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{it was my unrivaled skill with sword and pistol, and readiness to use them, that maintained the reputation of the firm.}
<A>__{towards the end of the game, dascher, seeing that he is losing, makes an unfair stroke, so obvious that the marker tells him so to his face. lieutenant dascher, for whom the stroke wins the game, takes the money which is in the stake bag, and puts it in his pocket, paying no attention to the marker's adjurations, or to roderick's. roderick, who is without his sword, reaches for a billiard cue and swings it at dascher's face. he wards off the blow with his arm, drawing his sword and runs at roderick, who is unarmed. the marker, a sturdy young man, catches dascher around the waist and prevents murder.}
<C>__{dascher}
<D>__{i see that you are without your sword, but i believe you are a man of mettle. will you give me satisfaction?}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{i shall be delighted; but you have lost and you must pay me the money before we meet, for, after all, you cannot pay me when you are dead.}
<C>__{another officer}
<D>__{i will undertake to pay you the 20 louis, but only tomorrow morning at the meeting.}
