<L>__{interior hallway moments later}
<A>__{zoe peeks out of the bedroom and looks both ways.}
<C>__{zoe}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{stan?}
<A>__{no one in sight. she waits a beat and then whispers louder.}
<C>__{zoe }
<D>__{stan!}
<L>__{interior kitchen night}
<A>__{zoe peers her head into the empty kitchen. nuts is with her.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{stan? hello?}
<A>__{zoe stands there unsure of what to do nexterior then we hear her stomach growl again. her eyes turn to the stove. something smells out of this world. she tiptoes over and opens the pot. it's beef stew.}
<C>__{zoe }
<D>__{oh, my god.}
<A>__{she makes sure the coast is clear and then looks for a spoon. she can't find one. she spies a loaf of white bread. grabs a piece, folds it and then scoops up a heaping bite of stew and devours it.}
<C>__{zoe }
<P>__{(mouth full)}
<D>__{oh, my god.}
<A>__{she replaces the lid on the pot. and now she just stands there. and stands there some more.}
<C>__{zoe }
<D>__{oh, who am i kidding?}
<A>__{she quickly takes two slices of bread and goes back in. this time, she uses one piece of bread as a ladle and then the other to turn it into a sandwich. she takes a huge bite.}
<C>__{zoe }
<D>__{oh. my. god.}
<A>__{stew dribbles down her chin. she takes a third piece of bread to wipe her face and then takes a bite of that one. nuts starts to whine and beg. zoe uses her bread ladle to toss some stew on the floor for him. it lands with plop. and now joan enters. zoe and nuts turn, their mouths bursting. joan doesn't quite know what to do. all she knows is she's supposed to be open minded.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{would you like a plate?}
<A>__{zoe shakes her head no. wow. this is embarrassing.}
<C>__{joan }
<D>__{a napkin?}
<A>__{zoe nods her head. joan gives her one. zoe holds it over her mouth as she tries in vain to swallow this inhuman bite.}
<C>__{joan }
<D>__{i'm joan.}
<A>__{zoe nods. still can't swallow the bite.}
<C>__{joan }
<D>__{and you must be zoe.}
<A>__{zoe nods again. she tries to shake joan's hand. it's the best she can do. unfortunately, her fingers are fluorescent orange from the cheetos powder. joan pulls her hand back.}
