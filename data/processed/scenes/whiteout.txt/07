<L>__{interior marshal's office mcmurdo day}
<A>__{carrie enters. walks by a mirror. takes a glance. is about to fix her hair, then stares at the reflection what's the point? we notice a slight scar on her right temple. she steps around the moving boxes to her desk, which is bare except for a thick binder labelled,`daily reports'. she takes a seat, opens a binder and flips past dozens of empty pages reading "incident: none. action taken: none." on today's page she fills in the blanks with "theft of botany sample." and "none." a pencil falls down onto the desk before her. bounces. then rolls off. she doesn't even flinch, or look up. just stares unhappily at the binder. camera tilts up several pencils are stuck into the cardboard tiles. she closes the binder and puts it on the shelf beside a row of framed photos: carrie in a marshal's uniform graduation day; crisp, clean uniform. she and two other girlfriends, all smiles, at a bar she's got a birthday cake in front of her. carrie on a beach somewhere, sitting in a chair, feet in the sand shaded by a palm. as she lifts the frames and moves to pack them in a nearby box }
