<L>__{interior state department day}
<A>__{liza, karen and chad arrive in the buzzing state department offices, knackered but in action mode.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{okay so, priorities are: take a shower, get me on linton's war committee, get me a dental appointment. not necessarily in that order.}
<A>__{karen walks past various desks covered in tons of post its. stops a staffer as he passes.}
<D>__{karen (cont'd) (cont'd) what's linton been up to while we've been away....have we declared war on california yet?}
<A>__{but before the staffer can answer they run right into linton. karen stands her ground.}
<C>__{linton}
<D>__{ah. karen.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{linton.}
<C>__{linton}
<D>__{how was london? good hotel?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{great hotel, thank you.}
<C>__{linton}
<D>__{good meetings?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{yes. we had some good discussions. the time at number ten could possibly have been better spent but then...}
<A>__{karen realises that linton is reading a message on his cell phone and not listening.}
<C>__{linton}
<D>__{good. welcome back. i will read your words when they come through. thank you so much}
<A>__{linton heads off to his office. a beat later so does karen. chad goes off a little towards linton's office.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{is chad coming... ?}
<C>__{liza}
<P>__{(watching)}
<D>__{he's doing his desperate chorus girl thing, hanging around trying to catch linton's eye. that's why he's wearing his push up bra today.}
<C>__{chad}
<P>__{(as he passes)}
<D>__{assistant secretary of state hi.}
<C>__{linton}
<D>__{brad.}
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{chad}
<C>__{linton}
<D>__{uh huh. exactly}
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{can i...?}
<A>__{linton ignores him as he goes to join bob adriano waiting for him in his office.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{so listen, liza, i need you to find out the names of the ten dullest committees currently operating on the hill.}
<C>__{liza}
<D>__{dullest?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{because linton is not going to call it the big horrible scarey war committee...they'll have buried the war committee under the most boring name they can think of. 'diverse strategy committee' not that, i'm on that. but it'll be a committee that sounds so tedious you want to self harm.}
<A>__{they glance over into linton's area. he is glancing into theirs.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{can you get me general miller at the pentagon?}
<P>__{(as she leaves)}
<D>__{my teeth hurt like hell.}
<C>__{liza}
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{sick of hearing about the teeth...}
<A>__{liza goes to her desk, picks up her landline.}
<D>__{liza (cont'd) (cont'd) hi. i'm calling from karen clark's office about a paper written by a staffer here. we need to know if 'post war planning: parameters, implication's and possibilities' has reached assistant secretary of state linton barwick yet?}
<P>__{(listens)}
<D>__{yeah...by liza weld.}
<P>__{(listens, shit!)}
<D>__{'pwip pip'? it's already been given an acronym?}
<P>__{(listens)}
<D>__{no i don't want to fast track it. would it possible to slow track it? well can we create one?}
