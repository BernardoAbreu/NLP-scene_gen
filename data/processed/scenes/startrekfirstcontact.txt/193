<A>__{the ship is stretching in the familiar "rubber band effect" that tells us a ship is going into warp... but this effect is much slower . it's on the verge of hitting warp speed. the enterprise still on their tail.}
<L>__{interior borg hive}
<A>__{data is standing right next to the queen, and is studying the borg console intently. two borg drones stand nearby, watching closely.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{i believe i see the problem.}
<A>__{in the blink of an eye: data whirls around and slams an arm into one of the borg drones. the drone is knocked off its feet. the second borg rushes at data, swings his arm at data's head. this is the same borg with the deadly stiletto tipped drill spikes seen earlier. the spikes tear into the flesh of data's neck, drawing blood. data reacts in pain. he grabs the borg's arm and with android strength kicks him in the chest at the same time. the borg flies backward, causing the cybernetic arm to rip from its socket in a shower of sparks. the borg queen swoops down at data for the kill. but data's too quick for her. with one swift motion, he turns and throws the borg arm like a javelin across the room.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{as the spikes on the severed borg arm puncture one of the diathermic oxygen tanks seen earlier. a huge explosion of deadly gas bursts out of the ruptured tank. the wall of roiling gas sweeps through the entire borg hive.}
<C>__{borg queen}
<P>__{(screams)}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{she lunges at data just as the gas envelopes them!}
