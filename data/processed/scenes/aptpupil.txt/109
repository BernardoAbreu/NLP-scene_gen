<A>__{dussander wakes up again. something is different in his room. he looks to the table next to him. all his magazines are gone. he looks to the other side of the room. ben is gone, his bed stripped of all linen. finally he looks to the door. it is cracked open. two men in suits are talking in the hallway. one we will come to know as detective getty. the other is a subordinate. dussander is clearly bothered by what he sees. he reaches over for the call button and rings it several times. a moment later darren comes in. getty sees this and stops talking. he watches dussander from the hall.}
