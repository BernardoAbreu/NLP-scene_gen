<L>__{interior bijou lobby night}
<A>__{luke comes out of the office carrying a folded movie poster. with a satisfied smile, he walks through the lobby, admiring how handsome the old place looks. old tim, snappily attired in his uniform, is sweeping a tiny pile of debris into a dustpan. mrs. terwilliger is straightening up the candy counter. all is well. luke goes to the lobby's poster case. he opens it, and unfolds a brand new one sheet poster for "sand pirates" the same design as the one sheet we saw in pete's apartment. methodically, he thumbtacks the poster up and closes the case. as luke passes the auditorium doors, a man comes out of the theater and crosses to the candy counter. the door stays open for a moment, and luke decides to duck inside and catch a bit of the picture.}
