<L>__{interior reserve vault area day}
<A>__{eric walks into the reserve vault area. he stops. he hears something. a scratching sound. he looks at it's source, two policemen, decked out in black flak jackets and gas masks are starting to come out of a sewer manhole. eric's eyes widen. he takes his silencer out of his coat and fixes it to his handgun. then, like a man with intent to kill, he rapidly approaches them. the one who came out of the manhole turns just in time to see eric fire into his chest. then, eric aims the gun into the tight crawlspace and fires into the other man. for safe measure he empties his gun into the tiny causeway. he drops the gun into the hole and then shoves the other policeman into it. he then pushes a large utility wagon over the manhole cover to stop anyone else from coming in.}
