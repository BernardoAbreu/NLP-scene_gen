<L>__{interior conference room day}
<A>__{the men in dark suits go in as if they owned the place. ray, mr. darby and robert smith stand immediately. adam remains seated. mr. darby is the only one near enough to attempt a hand shake, but when he offers his hand it is not taken. the men in dark suits sit down without wasting a movement and without acknowledging anyone. one of the men in a dark suit opens a briefcase. ray has been trying to make introductions.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{ah... the castigliane brothers. let me introduce you around ... please ... sit down.}
<P>__{(after they've already seated}
<D>__{themselves) ... this is mr. darby whom you know and this is the director adam kesher and his manager robert smith}
<A>__{the castigliane brothers do not acknowledge any of this, however, during the introductions the one with the briefcase removes a photo of a girl and sets it in front of ray.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{ah... she's very pretty.}
<A>__{we see the photo of the girl of a nice looking blonde someone we've never seen before. adam looks like he doesn't know what's going on and he's getting upset about not knowing. his manager, robert smith, is beginning to see the makings of a confrontation he's starting to panic.}
<C>__{mr. darby}
<P>__{(referring to castigliane brothers)}
<D>__{may i offer you gentlemen anything?}
<C>__{luigi castigliane}
<D>__{espresso.}
<C>__{vincenzo castigliane}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{uh what's the photo for?}
<C>__{mr. darby}
<P>__{(picking up phone and speaking)}
<D>__{one espresso ... no, that's it.}
<P>__{(sets phone down addresses castigliane brothers)}
<D>__{i think you're going to enjoy your espresso this time... i've been doing quite a bit of research knowing how hard you are to please... this one comes highly recommended.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{what's the photo for?}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(to adam)}
<D>__{a recommendation... a recommendation to you adam.}
<C>__{vincenzo castigliane}
<D>__{not a recommendation.}
<C>__{luigi castigliane}
<D>__{this is the girl.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{what girl? for what? what is this ray?}
<A>__{ray, still standing with a forced smile, turns to the castigliane brothers.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{we'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{interest?! there's six of the top actresses that want this thing.}
<C>__{luigi castigliane}
<D>__{this is the girl.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{ray...you better take care of this.}
<C>__{robert smith}
<D>__{hold on ... hold on, adam.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{hold on!!!!!!!! there's no way, there's no way!!!}
<A>__{luigi castigliane's espresso is brought in by the man who had been in earlier. the man sets the espresso down in front of luigi and takes a step back. the room becomes silent watching the espresso man and luigi. without looking up luigi speaks softly.}
<C>__{luigi castigliane}
<D>__{napkin.}
<C>__{espresso man}
<P>__{(leading forward to hear)}
<D>__{pardon?}
<C>__{luigi castigliane}
<D>__{napkin.}
<C>__{espresso man}
<D>__{of course. excuse me.}
<A>__{the espresso man leaves the room. luigi looks at the espresso. vincenzo stares at adam. adam is doing his best to stare down vincenzo. the espresso man returns with a cloth napkin and lays it down next to the espresso.}
<C>__{espresso man }
<D>__{will that be all, sir?}
<A>__{luigi doesn't answer and after a moment of standing very still waiting, the espresso man turns and leaves the room. adam is stared down by vincenzo and averts his eyes to the espresso cup. he looks around at ray and mr. darby seeing them stare at the espresso cup. vincenzo keeps staring at adam. luigi picks up the napkin and holds it in his left hand. with his right hand he lifts the espresso cup and places it above the napkin. he brings the cup and napkin to his mouth. he takes a sip of espresso. a small fleeting expression forms on luigi's impassive face as if for one millisecond he is going to vomit. his mouth opens and he allows the espresso to fall and dribble onto the napkin. he pushes any remaining espresso in his mouth out with his tongue. he holds it in that position for a moment.}
<C>__{luigi castigliane}
<D>__{is shit!}
<A>__{luigi castigliane stands up.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i'm sorry. that was a highly recommended...}
<C>__{mr. darby}
<D>__{that's considered one of the finest espressos in the world , sir.}
<A>__{luigi just stands there. a small thread on his left suit jacket pocket catches his attention and he smooths it back into the fabric. vincenzo closes his briefcase, takes out a hankerchief and cleans his nose then stands, placing the handkerchief back in his pocket.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{wait a minute!! what's going on here?}
<A>__{vincenzo just stares toward adam as if he's not even there.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{there's no way that girl is in my movie!}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{luigi castigliane}
<D>__{that is the girl.}
<A>__{the castigliane brothers begin to leave. adam stands up trembling with anger.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{hey!!!!! that girl is not in my film!!!}
<C>__{vincenzo castigliane}
<D>__{it is no longer your film.}
<A>__{adam turns white and stands very still as this sinks in. the castigliane brothers leave. as the big blonde wood doors close behind them adam starts to boil.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{you'd better fix this, ray!!!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i will speak to someone.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(turning to his manager)}
<D>__{and you'd better speak to someone too ... or find yourself another client!! this smells like a set up to me!}
<P>__{(back to ray)}
<D>__{and by the way, ray, i don't know who these guys are kidding, but every foot of film i've shot is in a vault at the lab that only i can access. no one's getting that film!!}
<C>__{robert smith}
<D>__{this is a catastrophe...}
<P>__{(turning toward ray)}
<D>__{you told me they might insist on a girl, that's all.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{why didn't you tell me, robert? that's what i mean ... you set me up! i woulda never come here.}
<P>__{(standing)}
<D>__{i'm leaving. i'm a director you don't want to lose ... you guys better fix this!!}
<A>__{adam storms out of the room.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(standing)}
<D>__{well...i didn't know that was going to happen.}
