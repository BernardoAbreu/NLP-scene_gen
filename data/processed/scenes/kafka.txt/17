<T>__{cut:}
<A>__{the assistants day oskar and ludwig. they look almost the same. at first glance almost identical. it's only a closer inspection that shows them to be imperfect twins. dressed in matching suits. one is sitting on kafka's new desk, the other in kafka's new chair. they're rummaging about in his papers, and whenever one selects a particular document for closer scrutiny, the other promptly snatches it out of his hand.}
<B>__{kafka}
<A>__{coming this way, has paused, having spotted the weird duo.}
<B>__{the assistants}
<A>__{continue with their mischief until one of them notices kafka coming and nudges the other so strongly he almost falls over. they're both standing at attention, looking guilty, by the time kafka arrives.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{my assistants, i presume.}
<C>__{assistants}
<D>__{yes that's us.}
<A>__{kafka smiles at them, half in friendliness, half in amusement at their quirky appearance.}
<C>__{kafka}
<P>__{(offers his hand)}
<D>__{i'm kafka.}
<A>__{oskar responds first, but ludwig knocks his hand out of the way to get there first.}
<C>__{ludwig}
<P>__{(shaking hands)}
<D>__{ludwig.}
<C>__{oskar}
<P>__{(now it's his turn)}
<D>__{oskar.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{you look like brothers.}
<C>__{assistants}
<D>__{yes we do.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{have you worked here long?}
<C>__{assistants}
<D>__{no, no, no quite a long time, yes.}
<A>__{kafka doesn't quite know what to make of these two, but they seem pleasant enough fellows and they're looking at him with such wide eyed innocence he doesn't know what more to say to them. so he turns to look around the new area he's been assigned a burrow all to himself now even a personal clothes peg on the wall for his coat. the assistants make stupid faces at each other behind his back, but look serious again when he turns around.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{well, we'd better move things from my old desk.}
<B>__{assistants}
<A>__{look at each other with identical frowns, then back at kafka. oskar nods, as if to say "oh, all right, if we must." and ludwig grins.}
