<L>__{interior main cabin day}
<A>__{chuck makes his way down the companionway into the main cabin. other crew members are already unpacking. the sleeping arrangement is pullman style with two rows of bunks on each side of the cabin. in the middle of the room is a gimbaled table. this is where the crew will eat and study.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{listen up. this is chuck gieg.}
<A>__{among the crew feature robin weathers, 16, a cherub with soft puffy cheeks and terry lapchick, 17, skinny and rodent like. robin approaches with a hand extended. he carries a 8x10 photo of a young man in a football uniform.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i'm robin.}
<A>__{chuck regards the photo.}
<C>__{robin}
<P>__{(flat)}
<D>__{that's my brother. he's dead.}
<A>__{apprehensively chuck shakes and retreats to a lower bunk. robin tacks up the picture above his bunk. terry unpacks in front of one of the lower berths. a loud "thud!" turns everyone around. a duffel bag lies at the bottom of the companionway. a large imposing figure climbs into the cabin. this is john goodall, 17, over six feet, big and broad. his hair is slicked back "dean" style and wears a full day's growth of bread on his face. compared to the others, he looks all man. everybody clears from his path. he stops in front of the lower, center bunk (terry's bunk) and drops his bag.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i will take this one.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{you probably didn't notice, but this bunk has been taken.}
<A>__{john just glares at him, then dumps all of terry's things onto the blanket on the bunk, gathers it up and tosses it into the remaining upper berth. terry watches, intimidated.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{anybody gotta problem with that?}
<C>__{rick}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{absolutely not.}
<A>__{john climbs into his bunk and closes his eyes. bill enters, followed by several adults. dr. alice sheldrake, 30, smart, attractive and tough, is ship's surgeon and skipper's wife. lawford appears with george pascal, 30's from brazil, dark, and fit.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{alright, listen up. this is dr. alice sheldrake.}
<A>__{the guys stumble over only half listening.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{i'm ship's surgeon. i'm in charge of aches, pains, biology, math and science.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{george pascal here is ship's cook.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{if you want to keep all your fingers, stay the hell out of my galley unless you're invited.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{some of you already know mr. lawford.}
<C>__{lawford}
<D>__{i have been charged with the dubious task of insuring your literary education.}
<A>__{lawford puts a hand on bill's shoulder.}
<C>__{lawford}
<D>__{bill butler is your first mate. but don't let his size fool you.}
<A>__{bill gives a half reluctant wave.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{so when the hell do we get to meet el capitan?}
<A>__{snickering.}
<C>__{terry}
<P>__{(aside)}
<D>__{maybe he's getting his wooden leg waxed.}
<A>__{laughter. a sound stops the laughter. almost on cue, the sound of slow methodical footsteps, pace the deck above them. then a shadow falls across the skylight, blocking the light. ominous. they all notice and look up.}
<C>__{lawford}
<P>__{(mysterious)}
<D>__{you'll meet him. soon enough.}
