<ACTION>__{The camera is moving toward an Indian city. We are high and far away, only the sound of the wind as we grow nearer and nearer, and through the passing clouds these words appear: "No man's life can be encompassed in one telling. There is no way to give each year its allotted weight, to include each event, each person who helped to shape a lifetime. What can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the record, and to try to find one's way to the heart of the man..." And now we are approaching the city, the squalor of the little shanty dwellings around the outskirts, the shadows of large factories... And as we move nearer, coursing over the parched terrain, the tiny fields of cultivation, strands of sound are woven through the main titles, borne on the wind, images from the life we are seeking: British: "Who the hell is he?!", lower class British: "I don't know, sir."... "My name is Gandhi. Mohandas K. Gandhi."... A woman's voice, tender, soft: "You are my best friend, my highest guru... and my sovereign lord."... A man (Gandhi): "I am asking you to fight!"... An angry aristocratic English voice: "At home children are writing 'essays' about him!"... the sound of massed rifle fire, screams...}
<LOC>__{EXTERIOR - CITY - DAY}
<ACTION>__{And now we are over the city, coming in toward a particular street in the affluent suburbs of New Delhi... there are a few cars (it is 1948), and we are closing on a milling crowd near the entrance to one of the larger homes. We see saris, Indian tunics, a sprinkling of "Gandhi" caps, several tongas (two-wheeled, horse-drawn taxis)... the shreds of sound continue -- American woman, flirtatious, intimate: "You're the only man I know who makes his own clothes." Gandhi's laugh... The sound of rioting, women's cries and screams of terror... An American voice: "This man of peace"... And as the titles end we begin to pick up the sounds of the street... an Australian and his wife, a BBC correspondent... all in passing, as the camera finally closes and holds on one young man: Godse. BIRLA HOUSE - EXTERIOR - DAY Godse steps from a tonga as the crowd begins to move toward an entrance-way at the back of a long wall.}
<CHAR>__{HOUSE SERVANT'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{He will be saying prayers in the garden -- just follow the others.}
<ACTION>__{In contrast to those about him, there is tension in Godse's face, an air of danger in his movements. He glances at two policemen who are talking casually, absorbed in their own gossip -- then he looks back at another tonga that pulls up just behind his. Two young men (Apte and Karkare) meet Godse's gaze, and again we get the sense of imminent danger. They descend and pay their driver absently, their eyes watching the crowd. Sitting along in the shadows of a stationary tonga a little distance down the street an elderly man (Prakash) with a short, close-cropped beard and the taut, sunken flesh of a cadaver is watching... Apte and Karkare look back at him. There is just the slightest acknowledgment and then Prakash lifts his eyes to the gate, as though to tell them to be about their business. THE GATE AT BIRLA HOUSE - EXTERIOR - DAY Godse hesitates before approaching the two gardeners who nonchalantly flank the entrance. He stiffens himself, cautiously touches something under his khaki jacket, then glances back at the stoic face of Prakash. Prakash's gaze is as firm and unrelenting as a death's head. Godse turns back, wetting his lips nervously, then moves into the middle of a group going through the gate. GARDEN - BIRLA HOUSE - EXTERIOR - TWILIGHT A fairly numerous crowd is gathering here, informally filling the area on one side of a walk that leads to a little pavilion -- some devout, some curious, some just eager to be near the great man. Godse moves forward through them toward the front just as hushed voices begin to remark -- "I see him." "Here he comes!" "Which one is Manu?"... Apte and Karkare move to different sides of Godse, staying a little behind, their movements sly and wary, aware of people watching. Featuring Gandhi. We see him distantly through the crowd. The brown, wiry figure cloaked only in loincloth and shawl, still weak from his last fast and moving without his customary spring and energy as he is supported by his two grand nieces, his "walking sticks," Manu and Abha. We do not see him clearly until the very last moment -- only glimpses of him as he smiles, and exchanges little jokes with some of the crowd and the two young women who support him, occasionally joining his hands together in greeting to someone in particular, then once more proceeding with a hand on the shoulder of each of the girls. The camera keeps moving closer, and the point of view is always Godse's, but Gandhi is always in profile or half obscured by the heads and shoulders of those in front. We hear the occasional click of a camera, and we intercut with shots of Godse moving tensely up through the crowd, of Apte and Karkare on the periphery of the crowd, watching with sudden fear and apprehension, like men paralysed by the presence of danger. Featuring Godse. He slides through to the very front rank. His breathing is short and there is perspiration around the sides of his temples. And now, for an instant we see Gandhi close from his point of view. He is only a few steps away, but turned to speak to someone on the other side, and Manu half obscures him. Godse swallows dryly, tension lining his face -- then he moves boldly out into Gandhi's path, bumping Manu, knocking a vessel for incense from her hands.}

<DIAL>__{Brother -- Bapu is already late for prayers.}
<ACTION>__{Ignoring her, his nerves even more taut, Godse joins his hands together and bows in greeting to the Mahatma. And now we see Gandhi in full shot. The cheap glasses, the nut-brown head, the warm, eager eyes. He smiles and joins his hands together to exchange Godse's greeting. Godse moves his right hand rapidly from the stance of prayer to his jacket, in an instant -- it holds a gun, and he fires point blank at Gandhi -- loud, startling -- once, twice... thrice. Gandhi's white shawl is stained with blood as he falls.}

<ACTION>__{Amid the screams and sounds of chaos we dissolve through to KINGSWAY - NEW DELHI - EXTERIOR - DAY Close shot. Soldier's feet moving in the slow step, half- step, step of the requiem march... Full shot. The huge funeral procession -- crowds such as have never been seen on the screen massed along the route. People everywhere, clinging to monuments, lamp standards, trees -- and as the camera pulls back from the funeral cortege it reveals more and more... and more. All are silent. We only hear a strange, rhythmic shuffling, pierced by an occasional wail of grief. We see the soldiers and sailors lining the route, their hands locked together in one seemingly endless chain. We see the two hundred men of the Army, Navy and Air Force drawing the Army weapon-carrier that bears the body of Gandhi. And finally we see Gandhi lying on the weapon-carrier, surrounded by flowers, a tiny figure in this ocean of grief and reverence. THE COMMENTATORS' ROSTRUM - KINGSWAY - NEW DELHI - EXTERIOR -}
<ACTION_ALT>__{DAY}
<ACTION>__{Commentators from all over the world are covering the ceremony. We concentrate on one, let us say the most distinguished American broadcaster of the time, Edward R. Murrow, who sits on the makeshift platform, a microphone marked "CBS" before him, describing the procession as technicians and staff move quietly around him.}

<DIAL>__{MURROW'S VOICE-OVER Mahatma Gandhi was not a commander of great armies nor ruler of vast lands, he could boast no scientific achievements, no artistic gift... Yet men, governments and dignitaries from all over the world have joined hands today to pay homage to this little brown man in the loincloth who led his country to freedom...}
<ACTION>__{We see the throng, following the weapon-carrier bier of Gandhi as it slowly inches its way along the Kingsway. Mountbatten, tall, handsome, bemedalled, walks at the head of dignitaries from many lands... and behind them a broad mass of Indians. For a moment we see their sandalled feet moving along the roadway and realize their quiet, rhythmic shuffling is the only noise this vast assemblage has produced.}
<DIAL>__{MURROW'S VOICE-OVER Pope Pius, the Archbishop of Canterbury, President Truman, Chiang Kai-shek, The Foreign Minister of Russia, the President of France... are among the millions here and abroad who have lamented his passing. In the words of General George C. Marshall, the American Secretary of State, "Mahatma Gandhi had become the spokesman for the conscience of mankind..."}
<ACTION>__{In the crowd following the bier we pick out the tall, English figure of Mirabehn, dressed in a sari, her face taut in a grief that seems ready to break like the Ganges in flood. Near her a tall, heavy-set man, Germanic, still powerful of build and mien though his white hair and deep lines suggest a man well into his sixties (Kallenbach). He too marches with a kind of numb air of loss that is too personal for national mourning. On the edge of the street an American newspaperman (Walker) watches as the bier passes him. He has been making notes, but his hand stops now and we see the profile of Gandhi from his point of view as the weapon-carrier silently rolls by. It is personal, close. Walker clenches his teeth and there is moisture in his eyes as he looks down. He tries to bring his attention to his pad again, but his heart is not in it and he stares with hollow emptiness at the street and the horde of passing feet following the bier.}
<DIAL>__{MURROW'S VOICE-OVER ...a man who made humility and simple truth more powerful than empires." And Albert Einstein added, "Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth."}
<ACTION>__{The camera picks out those who ride on the weapon-carrier with Gandhi's body... the stout, blunt, but now shattered Patel, Gandhi's son, Devadas, the strong, almost fierce face of Maulana Azad, now angry at the Gods themselves... and finally Pandit Nehru -- a face with the strength of a hero, the sensitivity of a poet, and now wounded like the son of a loving father.}
<DIAL>__{MURROW'S VOICE-OVER ... but perhaps to this man of peace, to this fighter who fought without malice or falsehood or hate, the tribute he would value most has come from General Douglas McArthur: "If civilization is to survive," the General said this morning, "all men cannot fail to adopt Gandhi's belief that the use of force to resolve conflict is not only wrong but contains within itself the germ of our own self-destruction."...}
<ACTION>__{A news truck is parked in the mass of the crowd. As the cortege nears, the photographers on it stand to snap their pictures. There is a newsreel crew center. The camera features a woman photographer (Margaret Bourke-White) who sits with her legs dangling over the side of the truck, her famous camera held loosely in her hand, un-regarded, as she watches the body of Gandhi approach. The intelligent features are betrayed by the emotion in her eyes. For an instant we see Gandhi from her point of view, and read the personal impact it has on her.}
<DIAL>__{MURROW'S VOICE-OVER Perhaps for the rest of us, the most satisfying comment on this tragedy comes from the impudent New York PM which today wrote, "There is still hope for a world which reacts as reverently as ours has to the death of a man like Gandhi."...}
<ACTION>__{The camera is high and we see the cortege from the rear, moving off down the vast esplanade, its narrowing path parting the sea of humanity like a long trail across a weaving plain... and as the shuffling sound of sandalled feet fades in the distance we dissolve through to RAILROAD - SOUTH AFRICA - EXTERIOR - NIGHT With the camera high we see a railroad track stretching out across a darkly verdant plain, and suddenly the whistle of a train as its engine and light sweep under the camera, startling us as it sweeps across the moonlit landscape. Tracking with the train. We begin at the guard's van, dwelling for a moment on the words "South African Railways," then pass on to the dimly lit Third Class coaches in the rear of the train, moving past the crowded Blacks and Indians in the spare wooden accommodation... There are two or three such coaches, then a Second Class coach... cushioned seats, better lighting, a smattering of Europeans: farmers, clerks, young families. Their clothes indicate the date: the early 1890s. The conductor is working his way through this coach, checking tickets... The track continues to the First Class coach -- linen over the seats, well-lit luxurious compartments. We pass a single European, and then come to rest on the back of a young Indian dressed in a rather dandified Victorian attire, and reading as a Black porter stows his luggage. FIRST CLASS COACH - SOUTH AFRICAN RAILWAYS - INTERIOR -}
<ACTION_ALT>__{NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Featuring the young Indian. It is the young Gandhi -- a full head of hair, a somewhat sensuous face, only the eyes help us to identify him as the man we saw at Birla House, the figure on the bier in Delhi. He is lost in his book and there is a slight smile on his face as though what he reads intrigues and surprises him. He grins suddenly at some insight, then looks out of the window, weighing the idea. As he does the European passes the compartment and stops dead on seeing an Indian face in the First Class section. The porter glances at the European nervously. Gandhi pivots to the porter, holding his place in the book, missing the European, who has moved on down the corridor, altogether. We see the cover of the book: The Kingdom of God is Within You, by Leo Tolstoy.}

<ACTION>__{MARITZBURG STATION - EXTERIOR - NIGHT Gandhi's luggage is thrown onto the station platform. A blast of steam from the engine. A policeman and the conductor are pulling Gandhi from the First Class car. Gandhi is clinging to the safety rails by the door, a briefcase clutched firmly in one hand. The European cracks on Gandhi's hands with his fist, breaking Gandhi's grip and the policeman and conductor push him across the platform. It is ugly and demeaning. Disgustedly, the conductor shakes himself and signals for the train to start. Gandhi rights himself on the platform, picking up his briefcase, his face a mixture of rage, humiliation, impotence. The conductor hurls Gandhi's book at his feet as the train starts to move. Gandhi picks up the book, looking off at the departing train. A lamp swinging in the wind alternately throws his face into light and darkness. His point of view. The Black porter stares out of a window at him, then we see the European taking his seat again, righteously. The conductor standing in the door, watching Gandhi even as the train pulls out. Then the Second Class coach, with people standing at the window to stare at Gandhi -- then the Third Class coaches, again with Blacks and a few Indians looking at Gandhi with mystification and a touch of fear. Gandhi stands with a studied air of defiance as the train pulls away -- but when it is gone he is suddenly very aware of his isolation and looks around the cold, dark platform with self-conscious embarrassment. A Black railway worker looks as if he would like to express sympathy, but he cannot find the courage and turns away from Gandhi's gaze, pulling his collar up against the piercing wind. The policeman who pulled Gandhi from the train talks with the ticket-taker under the gas-lit entrance gate, both of them staring off at Gandhi. An Indian woman near the entrance sits in a woolen sari, her face half-veiled. A small child sleeps in her arms, and there is a tattered bundle of clothing at her feet. She turns away from Gandhi's gaze as though it brought the plague itself. MR. BAKER'S LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR - NIGHT Featuring Gandhi.

<ACTION>__{TRAIN - EXTERIOR - NIGHT Indian. Steam. A breed of its own. THIRD CLASS COACH - INTERIOR - NIGHT Gandhi sits by a window in the dimly lit coach. Ba sleeps on the seat next to him, another member of the party next to her. Gandhi's solemn eyes are studying the huddled humanity in the rocking coach. People are sleeping everywhere, some half-erect on the benches, many on the floor among the bundles and trunks and bedrolls and baskets. Some have children, some are very old. One old man, sleepless like Gandhi, stares back at him across the shadowed squalor of the coach; somewhere unseen a crying baby is soothed by his mother. Gandhi looks at the bench across from him. Charlie Andrews, his tall frame cramped in a tiny space between the window looks at Gandhi dozily, a little smile of sufferance, then he closes his eyes again, leaning his head against the rocking window frame. NARROW STREET - A SMALL TOWN - EXTERIOR - DAY Gandhi is carried along in a ceremonial chair borne on the shoulders of some trotting men. The chair is swathed in flowers, and flowers are being showered on Gandhi by the running children and the crowd lining the narrow street. Ba and Charlie and two others are following in a flower-bedecked ox-cart, lost in the mass of people that are swirling around Gandhi. On a building top a British officer watches emotionlessly as Gandhi and the crowd pass below him. On this building and others we see some on his Indian soldiers watching with their rifles beside them. INDIAN VILLAGES - EXTERIOR - DAY As from a train... but the shots are varied; some close of farmers and water buffalo, and ragged children and women in colorful saris carrying pots on their heads, and some distant of villages as units, one and another and another.}

<ACTION>__{TRAIN - INTERIOR - DAY Gandhi's face in the window, he and Ba standing, looking out together, neither speaking. Gandhi writing in the cramped chaos of the Third Class coaches. Gandhi sweeping part of the carriage, making disgruntled passengers move as he tries to bring some cleanliness to their surroundings. RIVER VISTA - EXTERIOR - DAY A broad alluvial plain, the river threading through it, purple and gold in the rising sun. The camera races with the train along the river's edge, the reflected sun glimmering on the windows. RIVER BANK - EXTERIOR - DAY The sun is high and the train is stopped by the river. People have come out of the coaches to cool their heads with the touch of water, to stretch their legs. We see an English clergyman from the Second Class coaches, dipping a toe cautiously into the water, children of some British enlisted soldiers wading, splashing, faces alight with fun. And, farther along, the parasols of one or two of the English First Class passengers, a woman dousing her neck delicately with perfume. A British officer, tunic unbuttoned, smoking a long cigar as he walks along in a few inches of water, his trousers rolled up, his shoes off. Across the river down from the Third Class coaches a small group of Indian women is squatted by the river's edge, washing clothes. Some carry infants on their backs. Some small children stand near them. Their ritual of washing goes on, but they are all watching the passengers of the train. Gandhi stands with Ba and Charlie among the Third Class passengers. Ba cools her face with water. Charlie, his trousers rolled up, plays a tentative splashing game with a skinny little Indian boy. Gandhi is holding a large white head cloth which he is soaking in the water, but his eyes have been arrested by the sight of the women across the river. And now we see the women closely from his point of view, the camera panning slowly along them. Their bodies are skin and bone. The clothes they wear, which looked normal from the distance, are rags -- literally, shredded rages, one hung on another. The children are hollow-eyed and gaunt, staring listlessly at the train. One boy, with a stump for an arm, aimlessly pushes at the flies that buzz around him. Gandhi stands erect, lost now in the revelation of their poverty. His eyes hold on one woman at the river bank. Though her frail face is almost skeletal, it is beautiful but scarred by a severe rash down her cheek and neck. The cloth she is washing is a shredded piece of muslin. Her eyes have met Gandhi's as he watches her. Gandhi stares for a moment, a long beat. Then he slowly moves his arm out into the water and, without taking his eyes from her, releases the head cloth he has been rinsing. It floats along on the water down toward the woman. She looks from Gandhi to it with sudden excitement, a sense of incredulity. As the cloth nears her, she rises and moves almost greedily out into the water to take it. Her hands snatch at it quickly. Then she stands, looking at Gandhi. The infant on her back shifts, its huge hollow eyes reacting to the movement. Gandhi smiles slowly, tilting his head just slightly to her. And now that she has possession of the cloth, her manner calms again. And she looks back at him, and her lips almost part with a tiny smile of thanks. Hold Gandhi, staring at her, fighting the pain in his eyes... TRAIN - EXTERIOR - NIGHT Threading like a lighted necklace across the darkness of a vast plain. TRAIN IN HILLS - EXTERIOR - DAY Climbing green hills -- a totally different terrain -- and again we intercut, this time the train climbing: a boy and buffalo running a huge, crude grinding wheel, train climbing; farmers in terraced fields, train climbing faster and faster... until suddenly with a hoot of the whistle and the screech of brakes it stops! TRAIN - EXTERIOR - DAY Gandhi is leaning out of a window in a Third Class coach. Ahead of him other passengers are looking too; some have jumped down. Gandhi and Charlie jump down too. As they come clear they can see that a military train of an engine and two cars has been derailed ahead of them. A small troop of cavalry are coming slowly along the line of Gandhi's train toward them. Featuring the cavalry. They are British and their troop leader is viciously angry.}

And as the troop goes past we see from their point of view a group of Indian bearers, trotting in the middle of the horsemen, carrying two litters -- covered, each hanging by straps from a long pole -- and each bearing a badly wounded British soldier; one appears to be dead. OUTSKIRTS OF VILLAGE - EXTERIOR - DAY The shadow of a train moves slowly along the ground, a sense of tension and foreboding. We hear the engine chugging slowly. The camera lifts. Gandhi and Charlie stand at a window, staring out grimly. Other passengers are looking off too. Ba is seated, staring straight ahead, her face taut, deliberately not seeing what the others are seeing. GALLOWS - EXTERIOR - DAY Their point of view: On a hill across from the railroad track part of a prison wall is visible. In front of it a thick pole is straddled across two others. From this crude gallows two Indian men hang by the neck. One is in turban and dhoti, the other in a tunic. The sound of the train stopping. VILLAGE - EXTERIOR - DAY Close shot. Incense rising in shot. The camera pulls back and back. The incense is burning in a bowl sitting before Gandhi on a make-shift platform set in the little valley between the train line and the little hill where the Indian men have been hanged. A small crowd sits in a crescent before him, Ba and Charlie are bent in prayer on the platform behind him. When the camera comes to rest, the edge of the gallows and a portion of one of the hanged men is in the frame. We know we are looking from someone's point of view near the prison wall.

Azad and Patel come to the doorway, Patel makes the pranam toward Ba and holds it as he obviously prays. Azad has bowed his head and he too is clearly making some prayer for her.

Patel stands, letting Mirabehn pass before him and do down the corridor with Azad. He looks back. His point of view. Gandhi sitting, holding Ba's hand, his eyes once more on the floor in their empty stare. Another angle -- later. The light has changed. A fly moves along a small section of the floor that still contains a ribbon of the dying sunlight. Gandhi still sits, holding Ba's hand, staring into nothingness. The doctor appears in the doorway. He pauses, nods amiably to Gandhi, though Gandhi does not react to his presence at all. Moving quietly, the doctor goes to the other side of Ba and crouches, and lifts her wrist to feel her pulse. He holds it for a moment, then lifts his eyes in doubt and sudden fateful apprehension. He glances at her, then slowly lowers her arm and puts the branches of his stethoscope in his ears. He puts the acoustic bell over her heart... a moment, and he lifts it slowly, his face confirming for us what he and we already know: there is no heartbeat. He glances at Pyarelal, who only lowers his eyes. The doctor turns his head slowly to Gandhi. Gandhi. His point of view. His posture is utterly unchanged, Ba's hand still in his lap, his eyes still staring emptily at the floor in front of him, but suddenly tears begin to run down his cheeks. He does not move, there is no change in his empty stare, but the tears continue to flow. SMALL COURTYARD OF THE PALACE - EXTERIOR - DAY The funeral pyre burns, its work almost done. Mirabehn, Patel, Azad, Pyarelal, stand with other prisoners and the military wardens in solemn obeisance to the dead -- and the living, for Gandhi sits a little distance from the pyre, wrapped in his shawl, staring at the dying embers in tragic and impenetrable isolation as though he may never move again. Close shot -- Mirabehn watching him her face wet with tears. DELHI AIRPORT - EXTERIOR - DAY Extreme close shot. A piece of cloth, shimmering in a stiff breeze... For a moment we hold it in silence and then we hear the sound of an aircraft growing louder and louder. And slowly the camera pulls back and we see that the cloth is part of a pennant of the nose of an aircraft. We cut from the pennant to see the aircraft stopping before a reception area, a carpet rolled out toward its door. An Indian regimental band strikes up martial music. A detachment of Indian Royal Air Force comes to attention at the shouted command of their NCO. Featuring the aircraft doors.

Nehru and Patel are climbing the stairs, moving past them almost irritably as they mutter "Nehru, Nehru," "Patel," and make the pranam to the eminent men. In the heat of the city Tahib's rooftop is still Gandhi's "home" and has become a center of activity. Azad clears someone aside and ushers Nehru and Patel under the canopy awning. Nehru pauses as he lowers his head. His point of view. Gandhi lies curled awkwardly on his side of the cot. He is writing, Pyarelal taking the pages as he finishes, both ignoring all the people, the sounds of gunfire and distant shouting, but he looks tired and tightens his jaw occasionally in pain. The camera pans. A doctor sits near the foot of the cot, Abdul Ghaffar Khan beyond him. Near the other edge of the canopied area, Mirabehn sits with Bourke-White. They are whispering quietly, but Mirabehn has stopped on seeing Nehru and she smiles a relieved greeting. She knows Gandhi's feeling for him.

<ACTION>__{It is laced with pain. Bourke-White turns and looks out at Gandhi -- so tiny, so weak as he walks between his "props." He has now reached the end of the garden and is moving among the crowd assembled there. THE GARDEN - BIRLA HOUSE - EXTERIOR - TWILIGHT Gandhi is moving forward in the crowd, one hand resting on Manu, the other on Abha. He makes the pranam to someone, the crowd is bowing to him, some speaking, and we also see the crowd from his point of view -- "Bapu," "God bless you," "Thank you -- thank you." He turns to a very old woman, who makes a salaam to him. Gandhi touches her head.}

<ACTION>__{Gandhi turns to the person; he makes the pranam. Full shot. Godse is making the pranam to him and he suddenly, wildly draws his gun and fires. The camera closes on Gandhi as he staggers and falls, the red stain of blood seeping through his white shawl.}

<ACTION>__{FUNERAL PYRE - EXTERIOR - DAY Blackness. Silence. A moment -- we sense the blackness moving -- like dark smoke. The camera is pulling back very slowly and we can tell the blackness is smoke rising from a fire. And now we see that it is a funeral pyre. And all around that pyre a mass of silent humanity. Through the smoke, sitting cross-legged near the rim of the flames, we see Nehru... and Azad and Patel, Mirabehn and Kallenbach, the drawn faces of Lord and Lady Mountbatten, Manu and Abha... THE RIVER - EXTERIOR - DAY A helicopter shot coming slowly up the wide river, low, toward a barge and a mass of people in the distance. And now we are over the barge, and it is covered with flowers. Flowers flow downstream around it. An urn sits on it -- containing Gandhi's ashes -- and Nehru stands near it, Azad and Patel a little behind him. And as the barge floats down the river, Nehru bends and lifts the urn... Featuring Nehru. He swallows, restraining his own emotion, and slowly, ritualistically, sprinkles the ashes over the water. And as they spread, we hold on that stretch of the river, the flowers swirling languidly around it as the dark, timeless current moves them toward the sea.}

<ACTION>__{And slowly the camera begins pulling back, leaving the flowers, the brown, rolling current as though leaving the story of Gandhi, going far out, away from the great river, reaching higher and higher, through streaks of clouds as end titles begin. And through them, once more we hear, dimly, reminiscently, through the rushing wind: "At home children are writing 'essays' about him!"... the croaky voice singing, "God save our gracious King"... Dyer: "Sergeant Major --," the Sergeant Major: "Take aim!," Dyer: "Fire!," the sound of massed rifle fire, screams... "You are my best friend... my highest guru, and my sovereign lord." "Who the hell is he?," "I don't know, sir." "My name is Gandhi. Mohandas K. Gandhi."... the sound of rioting, women's screams, terror... "Find a child -- a child whose mother and father have been killed. A little boy... about this high."... "He thinks he's failed."... "Long live Mahatma Gandhi!... Long live Mahatma Gandhi!"}
