<L>__{interior audience room granada day}
<A>__{we start on a man's elegant slipper. he is seated in a splendid chair. moving up the stocking leg, we pass the garter of castile, coming to rest on a pair of delicate hands. his fore finger impatiently plays with a large topaz ring. over this, we hear distant footsteps, echoing on marble floors.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{a castilian face: aquilaine profile, olive complexion, dark eyebrows and meticulously sculpted beard. this is}
<B>__{treasurer sanchez.}
<A>__{a door slams somewhere, the footsteps getting closer. we can now here a subdued conversation. treasurer sanchez stands up as: the door opens at the far end of the large gilded room. a women, magnificent in somber taffeta, enters. queen isabel of spain moves towards him. he bows slightly as she sits at the end of the large table. she is followed by a priest, brother buyl, and three dignitaries of church and state. all sit beside her. treasurer sanchez takes a document and starts to read aloud. on screen the words: granada spain 1500}
<C>__{sanchez}
<D>__{your majesty would wish to know the true facts concerning the island of hispanola, our first settlement in the new world, and the activities there of your servant, christopher columbus, admiral of the ocean sea, governor of that island. you will remember with what hopes and promises he beguiled us the truth is that he now presides over a state of chaos, degradation and madness beyond imagining.}
<A>__{sanchez punctuates each word carefully.}
<C>__{sanchez}
<D>__{from the beginning, columbus proved himself incapable of managing the affairs of the island. he appointed his brothers to important positions, at once injuring the pride and dignity of the nobles who had gone with him. he promised to build a city, the city of isabel, named after your majesty. what he actually built was nothing but a collection of huts, and that in the wrong place, for all of it was easily swept away by rain and mud. is that not so, brother buyl?}
<A>__{the priest nods.}
<C>__{brother buyl}
<D>__{yes, your honor.}
<C>__{sanchez}
<D>__{he promised gold. not finding the easy quantities he promised, columbus commanded each indian to pay an annual tribute. most being unable to, they were barbarously punished, against the express wish of your christian majesties...}
<A>__{isabel lowers her eyes.}
<C>__{sanchez}
<D>__{since provocation and injustice never ceases, many of the indians have fled to the forests, or have begun to slay the christians.}
<A>__{isabel looks over at brother buyl.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{could it be so?}
<C>__{brother buyl}
<D>__{yes, your majesty.}
<C>__{sanchez}
<D>__{but there is worse. from the beginning, he forced the nobles to undergo physical labor, treating them equally with the indians, all of them reduced to slavery. when the nobleman adrian de moxica protested against such treatment...}
<P>__{(he pauses)}
<D>__{... he was executed.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{is that not true also, brother buyl?}
<C>__{brother buyl}
<D>__{yes, your honor. it is all true. all of it. i saw it with my own eyes.}
<C>__{sanchez}
<D>__{he has lost control. his great arrogance has led him into depravity. he encourages our soldiers to marry the native women. he promised a paradise, but he has made a hell full of all its horrors.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{is that the man i knew, treasurer sanchez?}
<C>__{sanchez}
<D>__{yes, your majesty.}
