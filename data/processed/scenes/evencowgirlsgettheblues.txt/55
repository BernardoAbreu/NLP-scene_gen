<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{sissy and the chink eating supper on a rough wooden bench. and as they finish, the chink goes into a cave and returns with a tiny peppermint stripped plastic transistor radio. he switches it on and the silence is broken by "the happy hour polka." still clutching the radio in one hand, the chink hops into the wheel of firelight and begins to dance. sissy walks around the fire watching the old geezer heel and toe, skip and hop. he flings his bones; he flings his beard.}
<C>__{chink}
<D>__{yip! yip! ha ha ho ho and hee hee.}
<A>__{arms swimming, feet firecrackering, he dances and dances. when the song ends, the chink puts the radio down as the news comes on.}
<C>__{chink}
<D>__{personally, i prefer stevie wonder, but what the hell. those cowgirls are always bitching because the only radio station in the area plays nothing but polkas, but i say you can dance to anything if you really feel like dancing.}
<A>__{the chink dances a little to the news, and then lifts sissy by her shoulders and guides her onto his pock marked dance floor.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{but i don't know how to polka.}
<C>__{chink}
<D>__{neither do i... ha ha ho ho hee hee.}
<A>__{the radio strikes up the "lawrence welk is a hero of the republic polka," and the chink and sissy dance arm in arm, their shadows reel against the curves of the depression in the mountain. night birds fly past with fluttering feathers. a bat flies out of the cave. the chink escorts sissy to a dark side of the depression and sits her down upon a pile of soft stuff: dried wheatgrass, faded indian blankets and old down pillows without cases.}
<C>__{sissy}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{so this is how jelly spends her visits to the chink.}
<A>__{a twanging noise sounds from the bowels of the nearby cave.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{chink}
<D>__{clockworks.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{clockworks?}
<A>__{the chink pauses to decide whether he should talk any further, then proceeds.}
<C>__{chink}
<D>__{the clockworks is one reason that i am here on siwash ridge. i accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the clock people.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{siwash, huh?}
<C>__{chink}
<D>__{he was a degenerated warlock who could turn urine into beer, and the honor that he extended me gave me rights of occupancy in this sacred cave on this far away siwash ridge. i came to the dakota hills to construct a clockworks of my own.}
<A>__{sissy cradles her head in her arms, but is startled by a louder noise from the clockworks. the chink is startled too. bonk! sounds the cave, and then it chimes poing! the chink smiles at the noise coming from his clockworks.}
<C>__{chink}
<D>__{but unlike the clockworks of the clock people, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....}
<P>__{(he listens)}
<D>__{......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{the clock people?}
