<L>__{interior empty apartment night}
<A>__{the apartment is dark. we are looking across a shadowy floor towards a large window, through which cold blue street light shines. through the window we can see the facade of the building across the street; we are three or four floors up. we can hear the animated, accented voice of an hispanic woman approaching the apartment from the hallway behind us.}
<C>__{landlady }
<D>__{ big windows, paneleen and everytheen. so you want, like your own place? like a town house?}
<A>__{a crack of light shoots across the floor as we hear the apartment door open behind us. a figure enters frame. as it crosses into the shaft of light we see that it is abby. she moves across the dark apartment, in silhouette against the window.}
<C>__{landlady }
<D>__{no one will bother you here, sweetie }
<A>__{an overhead light is switched on and the room is bathed in light. several feet from abby, an old man in a dirty undershirt is asleep on a cot. abby starts. the old man grumbles, slowly sits up, squints. with the light, the window behind abby has become a mirror of the entire room, in which we now see the matronly landlady standing by the wall switch. the landlady roars at the old man in spanish. the man glowers at her. the landlady looks back at abby.}
<C>__{landlady}
<P>__{(cheerful again)}
<D>__{i show you around.}
<A>__{we follow abby as she accompanies the landlady back into the short hallway entrance foyer. abby glances back at the old man.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{are you sure this is... are you sure this apartment is vacant?... mrs. esteves?}
<A>__{the landlady laughs cheerfully.}
<C>__{landlady}
<D>__{oh yes...}
<A>__{she gestures to a kitchen alcove on the left.}
<C>__{landlady}
<D>__{...that's the kitchen...}
<A>__{she turns and throws a few more barbs in spanish back toward the old man, then opens a door on the right side of the foyer and enters the bathroom.}
<C>__{landlady}
<D>__{...this is the bathroom...}
<A>__{she flushes the toilet.}
<C>__{landlady}
<D>__{...the toilet works and everytheen...}
<A>__{she bustles out of the bathroom and takes the two short steps back into the main room. she gestures expansively.}
<C>__{landlady}
<D>__{...and here we are back in the liveen room.}
<A>__{she gives one vigorous stomp.}
<C>__{landlady}
<D>__{...good floors. gas heat.}
<A>__{she points.}
<C>__{landlady}
<D>__{...that's mr. garcia.}
<A>__{the old man is now sitting on the edge of the bed, smoking a cigarette, looking for a place to put the ash. the landlady snaps at him again in spanish, and is again cheerful as she turns back to address abby.}
<C>__{landlady}
<D>__{...i was just esplaineen to him that he moved out of here yesterday...}
<A>__{she walks to the apartment door.}
<C>__{landlady}
<D>__{...you look around. don't mind mr. garcia; he use do be my brother in law.}
<A>__{she walks out and shuts the door. the room is quiet.}
<B>__{close shot abby}
<A>__{staring at the door. she looks at mr. garcia, looks nervously around the apartment. she looks back at mr. garcia.}
<B>__{close shot mr. garcia}
<A>__{staring vacantly at abby. he blows a stream of smoke across the room. the ash falls off his cigarette.}
<B>__{strip bar night}
<A>__{exhorter's cubicle hunched over the public address microphone in his small cubicle of exhortation, is the middle aged strip bar barker. years of service in the bar have left his exhortations depressingly bereft of conviction.}
<C>__{exhorter}
<D>__{how 'bout it, gentlemen, let's show out appreciation for lorraine up there, a registered nurse from bolton, texas, how 'bout it gentlemen, yeah...}
<B>__{the bar proper}
<A>__{meurice is one of a line of men sitting at the bar, all looking intently at the same point off left. all of the men except meurice are conservatively dressed and apparently well to do. an audio loop is blaring a bump and grind version of "yellow rose of texas," punctuated by the crash of cymbals and the thumping of toms. abby enters and sits into an empty chair next to meurice.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{looks like the state legislature is out of session.}
<A>__{meurice continues to stare intently off.}
<C>__{meurice}
<D>__{i thought this is where they met.}
<A>__{all of the heads at the bar start to swivel, including meurice's. a couple of patrons hurriedly snatch their drinks off the bar. in the extreme foreground a stripper dances on the top of the bar into frame. we crop her just above her white high heeled cowboy boots and her bare calves. the conversation continues with abby looking at meurice, but meurice and everyone else at the bar looking up at a point somewhere above the stripper's calves.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{listen meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.}
<C>__{meurice}
<D>__{i am?}
<A>__{the stripper drops a white leatherette vest onto the bar in the foreground. the audience cheers.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{you're gonna keep an eye on marty and ray, make sure nothing happens.}
<C>__{meurice}
<D>__{it won't?}
<A>__{two sheriff star pasties drop onto the bar. the audience cheers.}
<C>__{meurice}
<D>__{...ever occur to you, abby, that maybe i'm the wrong person to ask?}
<B>__{the exhorter}
<A>__{into his microphone.}
<C>__{exhorter}
<D>__{let's not sit on our wallets, gentlemen. lorraine is up there dancing her heart out, and if you let that cash money set on your hip, you might just as well be broke...}
<B>__{abby and meurice}
<A>__{she is rising to leave; he is still staring off.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{thanks, meurice.}
<C>__{meurice}
<D>__{any time. but you don't have to worry about a thing for a while. marty went down to corpus yesterday.}
<A>__{an old west gunbelt hits the bar. the audience roars.}
<B>__{the exhorter}
<A>__{into his microphone.}
<C>__{exhorter}
<D>__{and remember, gentlemen, we're always here, two to two, a.m. to p.m., three hundred and sixty four days and christmas, god willing and the creek don't rise...}
<A>__{ray's bedroom the room is dark. we are looking across the room toward a moonlit window. beyond, across the lawn, the lamplit street is empty. suddenly abby sits bolt upright into frame from the bed below.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{he's in the house.}
<A>__{offscreen we hear ray stirring in bed.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<A>__{abby twists around to look down at him.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i could've sworn i heard something.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{door's locked. nothing there.}
<A>__{he pulls her down out of frame and we hold on the window and the empty lamplit street. then abby rises back into frame, in silhouette against the window, looking down at ray.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i knew it. 'cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. he's real careful. fact is, he's anal.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{...huh?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{yeah, he told me once himself. he said to me...}
<A>__{she taps herself on the forehead.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{..."in here, abby. in here... i'm anal."}
<B>__{high angle ray}
<A>__{looking up at abby.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(yawning)}
<D>__{...well i will be damned.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i couldn't believe it either...}
<B>__{side angle abby}
<A>__{framed against the window, looking down at ray.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{...me on the other hand, i got lots of personality...}
<A>__{she drops down onto the bed out of frame. the camera holds on the window through which we see the empty lamplit street.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{marty always said i had too much. 'course he was never big on personality...}
<A>__{she rises back up into frame, in silhouette against the window.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{...he sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{yeah? what happened?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{psychiatrist said i was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so marty fired him.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(sleepily)}
<D>__{...i don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{well, i didn't see him anymore, i will tell you that much.}
<B>__{high angle ray}
<A>__{his eyes half closed.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i said, marty, how come you're anal and i gotta go to the psychiatrist?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{what'd he say?}
<B>__{side angle abby}
<A>__{framed against the window.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{nothing. he's like you, he doesn't say much.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(murmuring)}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{...mm hmm.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{when you don't they're usually nice.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{...you ever get tired?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{huh? oh, yeah, i guess. mm hmm.}
<A>__{ray's hand rises into frame and coaxes abby back down onto the bed, revealing, through the window, a green volkswagon now parked at curbside on the lamplit street. we hear the rustle of sheets. as we hold on the window, we begin to hear the faint, distant sound of metal scraping against metal. hallway living room we track down the dark hallway into the living room. as the camera advances the sound of the scraping becomes louder. we are moving across the living room up to the front door of the bungalow. the scraping is louder still as we finally frame on a close shot of the doorknob, which is jiggling ever so slightly. we hear a click as the lock finally releases. the door swings slowly open, revealing a man's hand on the outside doorknob. we follow the hand as the man advances slowly and quietly across the living room. abby's purse comes into frame, sitting on a bureau; next to it is a large tote bag. the hand rummages through the tote bag briefly, then the purse. the man withdraws abby's pearl handled revolver. he breaks it open. low angle close shot the man's face it is visser. as we hear a click offscreen, his face glows a dim orange.}
<B>__{back to his hands}
<A>__{his right holds the revolver, cylinder open, inside the purse. his left holds his cigarette lighter as he inspects the chamber. three of the holes glint silver, the other three are black empty. we hear the faint creaking of bedsprings.}
<B>__{wide shot living room}
<A>__{visser cocks his head, listening, and looks down the hallway. he takes a couple of quiet steps across the living room and, as the camera tracks up to him, opens the back door of the bungalow. we follow him outside onto the lawn.}
