<A>__{the fiery torch comes through first, held by the lead man. throwing dancing shadows on the walls of what appears to be a box cavern.}
<B>__{close on lead primitive}
<A>__{rising quickly to his feet. not seeing what the torch illuminates just behind him: the face of a dead primitive man, his body frozen into the ice. he does finally notice this, turning to see it, when he's}
<B>__{attacked viciously from behind.}
<A>__{the torch falls to the floor so that the fight is difficult to see, but it is loud and cruel. the creature squealing wildly as the grunts of the primitive now turn to the sounds of painful struggle. until:}
<B>__{the second primitive man}
<A>__{suddenly appears, driving his bone weapon into the body of the creature. again and again, until the creature is driven away into the shadows. the second man grabs the torch now, not to see if his hunting mate has survived, but in pursuit of the creature. in the light we see that he and his weapon are covered with spatters of oily black blood. as is the first primitive whose body lies heaving on the floor. the second primitive stepping over his hunting mate, stalking the creature into the shadows, where it has collapsed. the torch finally landing, for the first time, on its face. when the torchlight hits its face, the creature attacks. but the primitive prevails. he drops his torch and dispatches the already wounded creature with strong hard stabs of his weapon, one of which penetrates the creature's eye.}
<B>__{low angle on the dead creature}
<A>__{the torch, which lies on the ground, illuminates the dead creature's face. its wounds are flowing with the oily black blood, which, oddly now, begins to pool. as if it has intelligence, sentience. pooling and traveling into a fissure in the cave floor. and disappearing.}
<B>__{angle on the second primitive}
<A>__{watching this, unknowing. his chest heaving from the fight, as the spots of oily black blood which have spattered onto him begin to crawl. crawling toward his eyes and mouth. causing him to let out grunts of fear. which are the sounds we hear as the camera slowly cranes up past the struggling primitive to the roof of the cave, where the dancing shadows of the torch fade away: with the sounds of struggle. moving into darkness and silence. but only for a moment. until: sunshine breaks through the roof of the cave present}
<B>__{day}
<A>__{along with the spade of a shovel. and then the earthen cave ceiling gives way and a boy wearing nikes and an old t shirt falls through it. falling past camera. we hear a yell, then a thud, and a clattering of the shovel that's fallen in with him. then a pained}
<B>__{gasping.}
<A>__{then several heads appear in the opening. these are boys of ten to eleven, staring down into the cave. hot sunlight blazing in. we have traveled far, far forward in time.}
<D>__{2nd boy hey, stevie. you okay?}
