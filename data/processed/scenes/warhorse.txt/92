<A>__{joey is led into the hospital area beyond the trenches. the geordie leads him through the snowy streets. bandaged men strewn around, wounded soldiers waiting for attention. the waiting soldiers gather to view the strange spectacle of the horse. at one of the dressing areas, a nurse tends to albert's damaged eyes. behind him, we see joey pass in the street, but albert doesn't know it. joey limps, his foreleg clearly injured. the geordie soldier stops outside a makeshift hospital. joey looks frail and exhausted. a doctor storms over from his patients.}

<A>__{the doctor heads back into the hospital, dismissive.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{i've all these men to take care of, corporal, you can see that, can't you?}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{please, sir, this horse can pull through anything.}
