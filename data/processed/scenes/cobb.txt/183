<L>__{exterior jefferson davis motel night}
<A>__{the rain is thick yet another motel, another neon sign, and the limo parked in front of one of the cabins.}
<L>__{interior motel night}
<A>__{both men are sitting in rocking chairs in front of a fireplace. stump is in a bathrobe, his feet in a big pan of warm water, a bottle of booze in his hand. he looks a mess. cobb is idly playing with his pistol. he's calm, introspective.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{you're an educated man... tell me what you think...}
<A>__{stump just sits there, drinking.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{either my father was... inadequate ... for my mother... he was not the man i thought he was... not a great man... not even a good man...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{... or my mother was... trash... a common whore...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's that simple, isn't it?}
<A>__{stump just shrugs and takes another hit.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{as a boy i stood in court next to her because suddenly i was the man of the house but as i stood there steadfastly by her side and heard the jury say 'not guilty' i knew she'd been with another man the night of the killing.}
<A>__{stump drinks deeply once again.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{a man must defend his mother at all times, isn't that right, al? or am i a fool?}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{a man must defend his mother at all times.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{that's what i thought...}
<A>__{and the two men sit there silently, rocking slightly, trying to stay warm, when there is suddenly a knock at the door they stare at each other. cobb puts down the gun, struggles to the door and answers it. a man stands in the rain, carrying a briefcase, trying vainly to keep dry.}
<C>__{man with briefcase}
<D>__{al stump?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{in here.}
<A>__{cobb lets the man inside points to stump in the chair.}
<C>__{man with briefcase}
<D>__{mr. al stump?}
<A>__{stump nods as he swigs on the bottle.}
<C>__{man with briefcase}
<D>__{i've been chasing you all over the country }
<P>__{(opens his briefcase)}
<D>__{ i'm here to serve you papers.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{papers?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{i'm afraid it's divorce, stumpy. i know this routine.}
<C>__{man with briefcase}
<D>__{you're being sued for divorce.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{but my wife and i are still talking?!}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{yeah, and what she's saying is 'fuck you.'}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{fuck me? well fuck her. no, fuck him.}
<A>__{stump reaches for the gun and aims it at the man.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{you ain't serving me no papers.}
<A>__{the man is frozen with terror as stump rises from the chair drunk and crazed, aiming the shaky gun.}
<C>__{man with briefcase}
<D>__{i'm just doing a job.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{i love my wife.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{we all loved our wives, al, that's got nothing to do with it.}
<C>__{man with briefcase}
<D>__{you'll find somebody else.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{there's a million broads out there, stumpy put down the gun.}
<A>__{kablam! stump fires at the man but the shot goes wild. he's drunk, he's not experienced with guns, he's shaking.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{i am not going to accommodate this man, tyrus.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{you're all mixed up. give me the gun.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{you're absolutely right, tyrus, i've been accommodating people my whole life and it stops right here.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you've killed a man. i will kill a man.}
<A>__{kablam! kablam! he misses again. the man drops to his knees, begging for his life.}
<C>__{man with briefcase}
<D>__{no! please, dear god! i have a family, too!}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{don't give me that sob sister stuff!}
<A>__{stump tries to hold the gun with two hands, approaching the man, to nearly point blank range.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{al... no... al... al...}
<A>__{stump looks crazed, a bathrobe falling open, his feet bare and wet, his hair awry from the rainstorm. he aims the gun at the man's head, looks at cobb with wild glee.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{life is too short to be diplomatic. a man's friends don't care what he says or does. you're my friend, ty, right? you're my friend!}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{stump pulls the trigger click. empty. as the man looks up, realizing he's alive, stump strikes him across the face with the gun, drawing blood. the man scrambles to his feet and races from the room, grabbing his briefcase, and running to the door.}
<C>__{man with briefcase}
<D>__{you're crazy! no wonder she wants to divorce you! you're crazy!}
<A>__{and the man runs into the rainy night, leaving cobb and stump. stump's head collapses in his hands bewildered, exhausted. the two men sit alone for several beats before stump speaks. he is completely lost.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{i almost killed a man.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{a little drunken excess...}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{no. i put a gun to a man's head and pulled the trigger. i wanted to kill him.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{it's forgotten already. i saw nothing. nothing happened.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{yes it did.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{al, listen to me.}
<C>__{cobb }
<D>__{if i was hired to write a biography of the greatest sportswriter of our time a biography of al stump would i include what happened tonight? attorneys are pigs divorce attorneys are lower than pigs. what happened tonight was private. an intimacy. your own business. our own business. nobody else's. it wouldn't belong in a book about greatness.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{nobody's gonna write my biography.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{and when the brunette in the courtyard brushed against you, i know what happened, al. a warm summer breeze, the smell of jasmine, her black hair against a white blouse you came to life again, you got hard and when you saw her naked it was more than you could bear... it's okay, al, it's okay...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the brunette ain't gonna be in the book either...}
<A>__{stump looks up at cobb but says nothing. he picks up a nearly empty bottle off the floor and takes a hit.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{and the drinking? well, they used to say ol' ty had a drinking problem but you can booze me right under the table right now... no problem... and nobody's god damn business, either...}
<A>__{stump raises his hand, motioning cobb to stop.}
<C>__{stump}
<D>__{i get it... i get it...}
<A>__{a moment. a look.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{then get some sleep. you look pathetic.}
<A>__{stump crawls on the bed toward the pillows with the stupid grace of a drunk looking for a key under the mat. cobb helps stump lie down, pulling a blanket over him. stump rolls over to go to sleep, cobb tucks the blanket around him, and picks up the bottle from the pillow. cobb takes a last hit of the bottle finishing it off. he throws it to the ground, and looks around the room for another. cobb's pov stump's suitcase lies open on a chair. a nearly full bottle of scotch is visible.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{he makes it to the bottle steadies himself he's ex hausted. he takes a deep swig from the scotch. several deep gulps, enough to kill a horse, but it only helps him steady himself. and he sees something in the suitcase he looks down at cobb's pov cardboard box which stump has been filling with his secret manuscript.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{cobb opens the box and pulls out a paper. he reads it. he looks at stump, and cobb takes the box and the bottle to the chair by the fireplace, where he sits down, puts on his reading glasses, and starts reading "the real story."}
<B>__{close on cobb}
<A>__{he reads page one slowly and carefully, then starts mov ing through the box full of odd sizes of paper, hotel stationery, cocktail napkins, legal pads, all handwritten in secret. he keeps glancing up at the bed where stump is in the deep stupor of sleep.}
<C>__{cobb}
<P>__{(reading to himself)}
<D>__{... 'vicious, pathological, bubbling with violence... cobb's demons were not merely exorcized on the baseball field... they spilled over into all parts of his miserable life...'}
