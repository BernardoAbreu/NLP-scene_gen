<L>__{interior gym night}
<A>__{martin and debi enter and pause to take in the entire scene. a benevolent ronald reagan hangs crookedly above. basketball nets are swung back, draped with crepe. lights are half low and the music is loud. alumni are dancing.}
<C>__{arlene}
<D>__{welcome back! i'm arlene oslott joseph.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i'm martin blank.}
<C>__{debi}
<D>__{debi newberry.}
<A>__{debi heads off into the gym, smiling back as she strands martin. arlene rises from a card table. they have little to say. martin wasn't part of her crowd.}
<C>__{arlene}
<D>__{marty, you haven't changed a bit!}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{don't say that.}
<A>__{arlene gives him a nametag. as a special torture, the tags have yearbook photos. martin looks at the name tag uncomfortably.}
<C>__{arlene}
<D>__{we had pictures put on, that way everybody knows who everybody was!}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{wonderful.}
<C>__{arlene}
<D>__{so, what are you doing now?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{whatever i can get away with.}
<A>__{she smiles at his joke and is immediately distracted by the next arrival. martin moves off...}
<C>__{arlene}
<P>__{(to the next person)}
<D>__{isn't it cute. it's so everybody knows who everybody was!}
<A>__{he circles the crowded gym. looking for familiar faces. he stops at the open bar.}
<C>__{batender}
<D>__{what can i make you?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{beer.}
<A>__{the bartender gets him a beer. martin recognizes a guy at the bar. he is well appointed and shiny. he is ken aldridge.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{hey, ken. how have you been?}
<C>__{ken}
<P>__{(glancing at martin's name tag)}
<D>__{hello martin. how have you been?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{not bad. you?}
<A>__{bob destephano arrives next to them and orders a drink. eye contact is made.}
<C>__{ken}
<D>__{hello, bob.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{hey, bob.}
<A>__{bob turns slightly toward them. they continue in their conversation.}
<C>__{ken}
<D>__{i'm an attorney. i'm with moss, brice & fromeyer.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{that sounds pretty interesting...}
<A>__{bob wants to join the conversation but doesn't know how.}
<C>__{ken}
<D>__{sometimes. i'm in divorce, mainly. some property. some personal injury.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{those all seem kind of related...}
<A>__{bob takes another drink and mopes off, martin watches him go.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{tragedy makes you thirsty.}
<A>__{ken chuckles. the bartender arrives with the bottle. martin grabs it and begins to move off.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{well... i have to take this over to debi.}
<C>__{ken}
<D>__{here. take my card. wait a minute... here's a special one. for top shelf clients.}
<A>__{ken hands martin a monte blanc pen with ken's title and business address printed on the shaft. martin reads it and puts it in his kerchief pocket.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{ken goes back to listening to the guys at the bar.}
<B>__{martin}
<A>__{makes his way through the upbeat crowd of well wishers. terry emerges like an inkspot on a clean white whirt, and intercepts martin. his angst is barely under control as he sidles up to martin.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{i don't know, blank, all these fucking people, driving me crazy. look at them over there, memorializing old times, acting all like it was something "life changing." and the people in the national honor society? the name tags?}
<A>__{martin shrugs.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{they have special blue starts on them like it fucking matters now that they were in the honor club ten years ago. i'm getting fucking nauseous from all this sentimental bullshit. it's making me sick.}
<A>__{terry stops suddenly as if he's finished. martin reads this man's nametag.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{why are you here... terry?}
<A>__{terry turns on a dime.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{i wanted to see a couple people. but i don't want to talk about the old days... what did we have together, martin? typing?}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(remembering)}
<D>__{drafting.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{yeah, i couldn't stand that fucking class. but i appreciate you helping me out, man.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{don't mention it.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{yeah, thanks. well i'm going to try and get out of here, man. i will see you later.}
<A>__{terry slinks off. bar same bob destephano grabs two more scotches off the bar and turns to leave, thoroughly morose. in his path, he finds dan koretzky, the good looking side of brainy.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{bob. bob destephano.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{i'm dan. dan koretzky.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{computer guy.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{yeah... hey, i saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i sell bmw's. what do you do?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{not much, actually. my software company just went public so i'm just... hanging out, really.}
<A>__{there's a sudden lull in the conversation. bob tries his drunken hand at relating...}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{remember high school?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{sure. listen. why don't you join us up in the grandstands?}
<A>__{dan points up to a group of happy, laughing people. bob walks off shaking his head and smiling bitterly.}
