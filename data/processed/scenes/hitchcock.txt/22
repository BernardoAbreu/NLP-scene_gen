<C>__{whitfield cook}
<D>__{now, if this were a hitchcock picture what would two characters like us, married to other people, be saying?}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{you don't have to pretend you're not upset he hasn't read it yet, you know.}
<C>__{whitfield cook}

<C>__{whitfield cook}
<D>__{certainly more fun than reading those reviews.}
<C>__{whitfield cook }

<C>__{alfred hitchcock }
<D>__{don't stop looking on my behalf.}
<A>__{peggy appears in the pass through, beckoning hitch to hurry back into the living room.}
