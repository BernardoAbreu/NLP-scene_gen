<A>__{lula lays very still on the bed. her head is close to the small turquoise radio on the bedside table. she is listening to a piece of sad, nostalgic music and as we move in closer to her and the radio the volume increases. lula remembers some moments in her life with sailor: (music continues over) when he kissed her outside the jail gate. when he touched her breast the day after he got out of jail. when they sat behind the confederate soldier. when they danced to slaughter house. suddenly, lula sees an image in her mind that she does not recognize. she sees an abstract image of reflected light with two eyes looking through it at her. the image puzzles her. (the music continues over)}
