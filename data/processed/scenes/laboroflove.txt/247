<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior hospital afternoon}
<A>__{the room is crowded. maurice is now propped up in a seated position. he tries to digest a set of fish sticks on a tray.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{i can't believe you're here. i'm touched.}
<A>__{maurice looks across to adelle and gerald.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{are you two planning kids?}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{maybe later.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{you should definitely have children. they're really special.}
<A>__{adelle and gerald are in shock. maurice forks another fish stick with a smile.}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{i don't think you realize how serious this is uncle.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{how serious is it?}
<A>__{dr. ray, who has been standing by the window listening, steps forward.}
<C>__{dr. ray}
<D>__{you have two broken ribs, a punctured spleen and acute rheumatoid arthritis.}
<A>__{maurice gives a comforting smile to adelle.}
<C>__{dr. ray}
<D>__{the normal amount of build up in your arteries has been aggravated by over exertion. this is called, "claudication," as a result, there isn't enough circulation to your body. that accounts for the discoloration in your extremities and the muscle spasms i'm sure you've encountered.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{can it kill me?}
<C>__{dr. ray}
<D>__{it can, but it'll have to wait in line.}
<A>__{this surprises maurice.}
<C>__{dr. ray}
<D>__{we ran a c.t. and an m.r.i. we found bleeding in your brain. your collapse was caused by "transient cerebral ischemia"... a sudden loss of blood circulation to the brain. in other words, mr. parker, you had a mild stroke.}
<A>__{there is dead silence in the room.}
<C>__{maurice}
<P>__{(scared)}
<D>__{i suppose i over did it.}
<A>__{adelle moves over to maurice's side and holds his hand.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{what steps do we take now?}
<C>__{dr. ray}
<D>__{we operate. we find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... i just did this procedure on a senator and he's doing fine.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{what are the odds? do i have a fifty fifty chance of surviving the operation?}
<C>__{dr. ray}
<D>__{it's hard to say. it's a delicate surgery. there's no getting around the fact that it's a very high risk situation.}
<A>__{adelle strokes maurice's hair. maurice stares down at his food before looking up with great resolve.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{then it'll have to wait until i finish.}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{i finish the walk, and then we may take all the chances we want.}
<A>__{the room is stunned. adelle gets off the bed and collects herself.}
<C>__{adelle}
<D>__{listen to me very carefully, because i don't want you to misunderstand me... the walk is over uncle maurice. done. finished. you've made it to california, it was a miracle, now let's try to save your life.}
<C>__{maurice}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{i'm completing the walk. i'm almost there.}
<C>__{dr. ray}
<D>__{okay, maurice keep it calm...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we can talk about this again, but just so you know, we have a guard on this floor who's sole job it is to keep an eye on you.}
<A>__{maurice is crushed.}
<C>__{dr. ray}
<D>__{there are a lot of people out there who would like to see you finish, including me, but i'm not willing to put your life in anymore risk than it is... we do the operation, and when you're better, you finish the walk.}
<A>__{the room is dead again. maurice drowns in his thoughts.}
