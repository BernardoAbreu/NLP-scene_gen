<L>__{exterior campfire night}
<A>__{tamara leaps up, startled. her face is covered in sweat, her eyes as terrified as the victim from her dream. nearby we hear screaming of another type. remo.}
<L>__{exterior open field night}
<A>__{muffled screams. we pull out of remo's wide mouth, stuffed with cloth, trying to bellow in uncontrollable agony. a hand comes in and pulls out the cloth. it's conan.}
<C>__{remo}
<D>__{please! mercy!}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{you are more fit to inflict torture than to endure it. your life is not nailed to your spine as my peoples are.}
<A>__{we pull out, revealing that remo arms are spread eagle, attached to ropes pulled taught by opposing tree limbs. conan nudges him with the point of his sword. remo screams in agony, then speaks in his savage, broken dialect.}
<C>__{remo}
<D>__{stop! stop! i know how make you rich! rich! you hear name khalar singh? you have what he want. the girl, yes? khalar give you anything for her. more!}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{why would he?}
<A>__{remo pauses, not wanting to answer. conan put the blade back to remo's neck.}
<C>__{remo}
<D>__{she could be the one.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{one what?}
<C>__{remo}
<D>__{the one. the queen.}
<A>__{conan's mind races, remembering khalar's words from long ago.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{a queen in hiding.}
<C>__{remo}
<D>__{yes! yes! i sent to find her. bring her. he wait for me now, at great wall. he pay you anything. more!}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{so i should ransom her to your master? not exactly loyal but still, a good idea.}
<A>__{conan pulls out a sheet of handwritten paper from remo's tunic.}
<C>__{conan }
<D>__{you'll help me deliver it.}
