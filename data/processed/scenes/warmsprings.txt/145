<L>__{exterior grounds afternoon}
<A>__{franklin and elliot are walking. helena is close behind, coaching.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{use elliot, not the cane. switch your weight to elliot... good! keep your head up.}
<A>__{off to the side pat, jake, eloise, woodhall and daisy are having an informal picnic, observing franklin.}
<C>__{eloise}
<D>__{why is he working so hard to hide it?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{he doesn't have a choice.}
<C>__{eloise}
<D>__{oh, i disagree.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{how can you disagree? "there but for the grace of god goes us," that's what they're saying. as if our bodies is who we are, but it's not. it's our souls is who we are, but they don't know that.}
<C>__{eloise}
<D>__{i wish he could just wheel himself out there in front of everybody.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{he can't do that eloise, it's politics.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{it's not gonna matter if he hides his legs as long as he don't hide what he knows. and what he knows is what it's like to be one of us.}
<A>__{franklin, getting closer, raises his cane in greeting.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{good afternoon, everyone!}
<A>__{off balance franklin goes down hard bringing elliot down with him. eleanor, louis and roy all rush to his aid, but helena is there first.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{take a moment to catch your breath...}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{damn. you okay son?}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{i'm fine, pop.}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{you fell down.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{yes, i did, daisy. twelfth time today. must be a new record!}
<A>__{daisy laughs as do the others, though some can't hide their concern. franklin struggles hard as roy and elliot help him to his feet.}
