<B>__{general hospital}
<A>__{afternoon. st. luke's. letour, wearing tweed jacket, walks down the corridor, checks room numbers. a nurse passes. he stops at a room, pushes the door a crack, peeks inside, quietly enters. inside the hospital room, mrs. jost, sixty five, lies sedated, attached to iv tubes and a respirator. flowers wreathe the bed. randi sleeps in a chair by the window. letour looks from mrs. jost to randi and back again: a vibrant woman reduced to a shell. he soundlessly eases into a vacant chair. his mind goes back. randi twists fitfully in her chair. a stuffed bear peeks over family photos on the window sill. marianne steps into the doorway, stops, frozen watching the tableau: john, randi, her mother. her face is ravaged: the death watch has taken its toll. letour reaches his arm, touches the hospital bed. marianne tiptoes behind john. he turns, stands.}
<C>__{letour}
<P>__{(soft)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i...}
<A>__{she puts her finger to her lips. he nods. she steps closer, holds him politely. his cheek nestles in her neck. they turn toward the door, step into the corridor, walk arm in arm as if supporting each other.}
<C>__{letour}
<P>__{(after a moment)}
<D>__{i always thought my father would die first. he would die, then my mother and i would reconcile. just her and me. i hated him for living.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{it's like a joke. it's not a real feeling. it's like a feeling of a feeling.}
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{my old man bawling in the hospital, me popping in and out of the john getting loaded.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i miss you.}
<A>__{they stop. she kisses him.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{you tried to kill me. you took ten years of my life one way or another.}
<P>__{(he kisses her)}
<D>__{i couldn't hate my mom i was too busy hating you.}
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{i thought i was just killing myself.}
<A>__{she runs her hands under his shirt, up his back.}
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{selfish.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{i remember.}
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{what it felt like.}
<P>__{(kisses his face)}
<D>__{what this tasted like.}
<A>__{he slips his hands under her blouse, caresses her breasts.}
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{i see you and my heart starts thumping.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{john.}
<A>__{they kiss deeper, bodies grinding. the painful present fades. a nurse approaches with wheelchair patient. she tries to pass one side of john and marianne, tries the other side, is blocked again. the nurse stops, stares at their soap opera. sensing her glare, john and marianne, hands over and under each other, stop, look to the nurse: embarrassed yet blissful.}
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{excuse us.}
<P>__{(to marianne)}
<D>__{let's go.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{come. come with me.}
