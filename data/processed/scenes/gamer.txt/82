<A>__{kable and the guard are ant sized in what looks like a massive driving range. virtual targets are holographically projected in mid air at various heights and distances. other prisoners are there too, a ways off; well out of earshot. kable looks over a swarmer cartridge, slams it into his weapon; switches turrets, takes a bead on a virtual target... we see him intentionally pan the sight off to the left of target; he pulls the trigger click. the target and several others close by turns red, blinks a hit. this thing doesn't just take out individuals; it takes out}

<D>__{who aims?}
<C>__{kable}
<P>__{(caught off guard)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{hispanic guard}
<D>__{who aims... the slayer? or the player?}
<A>__{kable narrows his eyes, focuses across the field, where other prisoners are being briefed and upgraded... he spots hackman.}
<C>__{kable}
<D>__{not much to aiming... it's just hand eye coordination. i'm the hand... someone, somewhere else is the eye.}
<C>__{hispanic guard}
<D>__{that's tripped.}
<A>__{kable glances at the guard... he struggles part of him feels like he's talking too much; but he can't help being grateful for the human interaction.}
<C>__{kable}
<D>__{sometimes... they take over you know, completely. they move you. like a robot.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but it doesn't work so good... that part's just for show. you can't really fight that way.}
<C>__{hispanic guard}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{kable}
<D>__{there's a delay...}
<C>__{hispanic guard}
<D>__{yeah, the ping... they talk about that. the time it takes the slayer to respond to the command... it's like, five millisecond ping, eight millisecond ping...}
<A>__{kable gets a bead for a headshot on hackman.}
<C>__{kable}
<D>__{whatever you call it. a slice of a second is the difference between living and dying out there. when the trigger pulls }
