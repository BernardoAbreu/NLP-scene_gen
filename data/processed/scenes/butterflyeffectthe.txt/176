<L>__{interior evan's dorm day}
<A>__{evan enters his familiar looking dorm and hears the familiar sounds of thumper having sex with another naked gothic co ed. on evan's bed.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{get out. both of you.}
<C>__{thumper}
<D>__{sorry, dude. just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.}
<A>__{evan's temper flares and he picks up a chair and smashes it against a wall above thumper's head.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i'm not saying it again.}
<A>__{thumper and the co ed quickly cover themselves in the blankets and leave. alone in the room, evan looks under his bed and breathes a sigh of relief to see all of his journals are intact. he sifts through them again. he finally finds the passage he needs. something catches the corner of evan's eyes and he turns to examine it. to the left of thumper's buddha statuette sits a large votive candle that bears a portrait of jesus christ.}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(humble)}
<D>__{lord give me the strength and guidance i need to set things right.}
<A>__{as he begins reading a passage to himself, sounds echo backward at us from another time and place. and the entire room shimmers around him }
