<A>__{... behind the bungalows, adjacent the delivery gate. meet dave childress, a forty something ditto head. the residual effects of a hangover linger as he sneaks a cigarette before first period. he wears a faded hawaiian shirt and huarache sandals. an old military tattoo emblazons his left forearm. as he crushes out his cigarette, something catches his eye.}

<A>__{... thru a chain link fence we see a handful of cholo types loitering around the shed. childress investigates. as he approaches the fence...}
<C>__{childress}
<D>__{... hey, ese(s)?!}
<A>__{homeboys scatter in all directions, some hop the chain link fence, others scurry out a narrow gate behind the shed. childress weighs an amused smirk. now out of nowhere a gangbanger lurches from the shed, buttoning his sagging dickies and tripping over his own feet. he scrambles out the back gate and is gone. childress, curiosity piqued, now enters the compound through a tear in the fence.}
