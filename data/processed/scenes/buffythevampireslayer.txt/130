<L>__{interior buffy's house night}
<A>__{buffy and pike walk in, pike still a bit unsteady on his feet.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{how are you doing?}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{oh, i'm good. i'm good. kind of miss my knees, though.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{you want some water or something?}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{water. okay.}
<A>__{they move into the kitchen.}
<C>__{pike}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{do you do this kind of thing a lot? i mean, is this like a hobby?}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{not exactly.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{they were vampires, weren't they?}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{god! unbelievable. vampires.}
<A>__{buffy hands pike the water and they move back into the living room. pike curls up in an armchair by the window. buffy begins stripping off her bloody clothes, leaving on a tank top and jeans.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{you had a car full of stuff. were you leaving?}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{yeah, i was bailing. i have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, i guess. bad scene.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{well, stay here tonight.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{thanks. tomorrow morning, i'm on a bus. i'm gone.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{where are you gonna go?}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{well, i've always wanted to see oxnard.}
<A>__{as buffy strips down to her tank top, she notices a gash on her arm. it's not bleeding much any more, but it's fairly impressive. pike jumps up to help as she pats it down with her shirt.}
<C>__{pike}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{hey, jeez are you okay? you need a hand?}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{it's nothing. it doesn't hurt.}
<A>__{pike looks at her a moment as she wraps her shirt around it.}
<C>__{pike}
<P>__{(almost awed)}
<D>__{who are you?}
<A>__{buffy doesn't look up. the questions seems to upset her a great deal. she even fights back tears.}
<C>__{pike}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i just mean... well you seemed like such a flake. but, in a good way! i can just keep talking till you strike me dead, or...}
<A>__{buffy smiles at this, though still upset. she sits down.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{things are kind of confusing.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{i will back that up.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{three weeks ago all i thought about was... well, i didn't actually think about anything. i definitely didn't expect this.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{i know. my guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{it's weird. i went back to my old grade school once, to the playground i used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... i went back and it was so tiny, the whole place. i couldn't even fit on the swings. everything just looked so small.}
<P>__{(collects herself)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i'm babbling.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{no, you're not.}
<A>__{but she stands anyway, head to the stairs.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{i'm kinda beat. you can stay in my mom's room if you want.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{i think i will just hang out here. make sure the sun comes up and everything.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{you sure?}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{oh, i will be fine. got my chair, got my window, i'm great.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{mmkay.}
<A>__{she starts up the stairs.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{hey, buffy...}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{you know, you saved my life. and i just wanted to say... i forgive you for talking during the movie. almost.}
<A>__{she gives him a look, heads upstairs. he watches her go, looks out the window.}
