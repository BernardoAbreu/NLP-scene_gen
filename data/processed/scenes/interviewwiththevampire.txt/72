<D>__{another doll? i have ten, you realize.}
<A>__{focus on early 19th century french dolls wood, glass, wax, bisque all around the bedroom, on chairs, on the bed. some newish, some tattered old.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{well, i thought you could use another.}
<A>__{he hands her the box. it is a fine parisian jumeau doll. she likes it and stokes its face.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{why always on this night?}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{what night? what do you mean?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{you always give me the doll on the same night of the year.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{i didn't realize.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{is this my birthday?}

<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{some of these are so old and tattered. you should throw them away.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i have. or there would be twice as many.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{but you're the fairest by far.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{you dress me like a doll. you make my hair like a doll. why?}

<B>__{parlour}
<A>__{where louis is reading by the window. she walks to a mirrored cabinet, takes out a scissors and begins cutting her hair.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{you want me to be a doll forever?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{claudia don't }
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{why not?}
<A>__{she continues cutting. she sees lestat emerge from her bedroom in the mirror behind her then turns to him, an angelic little boy's face now with soft curls around her face.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{can't i change, like everybody else?}
<A>__{she walks past him, back into her bedroom and slams the door. a beat. louis looks from the mass of blonde hair on the floor to lestat. then a horrid scream pierces the silence. more screams, which become roars.}
