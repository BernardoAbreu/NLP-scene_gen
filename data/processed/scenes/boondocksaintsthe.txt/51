<L>__{interior rocco's apartment night}
<A>__{rocco comes out of the bathroom. he storms out to his small, round, living room table at which the boys are seated. he is wearing a white, polyester shirt with gold trim that is a uniform of some kind for perhaps a chain of restaurants. it is unbuttoned all the way down and his white t shirt is hanging out. he is wearing a name tag that reads "jaffar". he is upset. he slams down a chair across from the brothers who are sitting there cleaning guns and silencers. all the accouterments of death are sprawled before them. they are smoking as they carefully disassemble their firearms.}

<B>__{flashback exterior sidewalk downtown boston night}
<A>__{the boys are walking across copley square. connor looks at the note he wrote at the police station. they stand on the sidewalk and light smokes. they are in their regular garb; thick naval p coats, jeans and leather boots. they each carry a mid sized, black, duffle bag. they are serious and business like. they scan the plaza hotel from across the street. the elite exit and enter the hotel. connor glances at his pocket watch. it's 8:45.}
