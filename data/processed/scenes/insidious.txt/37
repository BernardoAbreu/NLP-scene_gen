<L>__{interior hospital room, icu unit day}
<A>__{ the stern sterility of a hospital. josh and renai, eyes lined by dark circles, stand in front of a dour neurologist, dr. joel sercarz (46). renai dabs her eyes with a tissue. they are red with tears. beyond a window in front of them, lying on a gurney in an icu chamber, is the unconscious body of dalton.}
<C>__{dr. sercarz}
<D>__{okay...as of yet, our tests have not drawn any conclusive answers for you. repeated blood and csf cultures are normal, making an infective origin highly unlikely. tests for lyme disease and repeated polymerase chain reaction are negative. systemic vasculitis was ruled out. dalton remains in an areactive coma without focal signs or abnormal brainstem reflexes.}
<A>__{josh and renai struggle to follow the cold, multi syllable medical terminology...like stranded tourists keeping up with a foreign language.}
<C>__{dr. sercarz }
<D>__{we've looked for bacterial pathogens like meningoencephalitis, but haven't seen anything.}
<C>__{dr. sercarz }
<D>__{i wouldn't say we've exhausted every single angle...but we're close. the underlying cause is still unknown.}
<A>__{josh and renai look in at their boy.}
<C>__{dr. sercarz }
<D>__{the good news is that he's breathing without the use of a mechanical apparatus, and there are no lesions or hemorrhages in any of the ct scans.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{so...there's no brain damage or...?}
<C>__{dr. sercarz}
<D>__{none that we've detected. technically, he's in a coma. he doesn't respond to stimuli, he has no sleep wake cycle, but there's no brain trauma or infection. his scans are normal. to be honest, i've never seen anything like it.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{that fall he took...i mean, it looked like he hit his head pretty hard.}
<C>__{dr. sercarz}
<D>__{we definitely exhausted that possibility, but it was always doubtful. the cut was superficial, there wasn't even a skull fracture.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{he can't just not wake up...there's got to be something...}
<A>__{renai sobs, tears streaming down her face. josh looks like a deer in the headlights. stunned dumb. sercarz clears his throat. this part of the job isn't his specialty.}
<C>__{dr. sercarz}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{so what do we do now? does he stay here?}
<C>__{dr. sercarz}
<D>__{we'll conduct some further testing, but beyond that...i really don't know.}
<A>__{his pager goes off. he checks it.}
<C>__{dr. sercarz }
<D>__{excuse me for a minute. i have to step out. a nurse will be with you in just a moment.}
<A>__{he leaves quickly. josh and renai press on the glass, separated in body and spirit from their son.}
