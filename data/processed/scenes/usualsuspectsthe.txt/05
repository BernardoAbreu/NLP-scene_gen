<A>__{s exterior street new york day fred fenster, a tall, thin man in his thirties strolls casually down the street. he is dressed conspicuously in a loud suit and tie with shoes that have no hope of matching. he smokes a cigarette and chews gum at the same time. he happens to glance over his shoulder and notice a brown ford sedan with four men in it cruising along the curb. he picks up his step a little. the ford keeps up. he looks ahead at the corner. he tries to look as comfortable as he can, checking his watch as though remembering an appointment he is late for. the ford stays right on him. suddenly, he bolts. he gets no more than a few yards before cars pour out of every conceivable nook and cranny. brakes are squealing, radios squawking, guns cocking. fenster is surrounded instantly. he stops short and flaps his hands on his thighs in defeat.}
