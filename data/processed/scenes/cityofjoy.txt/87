<L>__{interior godfather's "throne room" old radio day}
<A>__{the music is of days gone by, playing on an old radio. sticks of burning incense send off trails of smoke. the godfather, mr. ghatak, looking infirm, wipes a tear from his eye.}
<C>__{ghatak}
<D>__{acha!}
<A>__{now we see max and joan seated on cushions before the godfather, tea in hand. max catches a glimpse in an anteroom of several thugs with several young girls, one of whom is poomina. she catches a glimpse of max as she disappears past a door. a moment later, her head peeks around the door frame. she brings her hands together.}
<C>__{ashoka }
<D>__{you!}
<A>__{poomina quickly disappears. max's attention is pulled back to the godfather...}
<C>__{ghatak}
<D>__{i understand that you're interested in expanding your clinic and free school, and that you intend to start treating lepers in the city of joy.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{we'd like to better serve the entire community, mr. ghatak.}
<C>__{ghatak}
<D>__{of course. that's very good. admirable. and we'd be pleased to rent you suitable space. but you must understand that certain payments will go up.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i understand the rent would have to go up if we rent larger quarters from you, mr. ghatak, but why should we have to pay more protection?}
<C>__{ghatak}
<D>__{more people, more potential trouble. strangers. if i don't charge you, what will i tell others?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{but we can't afford it!}
<C>__{ghatak}
<D>__{surely if you can expand, you can pay more.}
<A>__{joan throws up her hands how do you reason with this man?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{am i stupid, but isn't this protection money money we're paying you to protect us from you?}
<C>__{ghatak}
<D>__{we live in chaotic times, miss bethel, doctor. i control the city of joy and maintain it as a model of harmony. it's a miracle, but a very fragile miracle.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{and how are we threatening your miracle?}
<C>__{ghatak}
<D>__{i admire your courage in choosing to work in such a violent place, miss bethel.}
<C>__{ghatak }
<D>__{your neighbors in the city of joy, they're not educated, they're given to violence, to meanness, i can promise you they won't like having lepers among them, but because they know you're under my protection...}
<A>__{he dispatches a globule of spit into the copper urn next to his right toe... and tries to get to his feet. the goonda hurries forward to help him.}
<C>__{ghatak}
<D>__{doctor, do you like our music?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{well, i can't say i've developed a craving for it yet.}
<C>__{ghatak}
<D>__{it's difficult to appreciate what we don't understand, isn't it? let me put it another way: the world is a terrible place. only the ruthless prevail. my son will make the arrangements with you.}
<A>__{one of the thugs helps the godfather outside, where, in the b.g., we see him listening to his music and pottering in his garden. as max and joan turn, max finds himself face to face with ashoka, who wears max's necklace and chai. there's a long pause as the two of them take the other's measure.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(to ashoka)}
<D>__{i like your taste in neckwear.}
<A>__{joan puts a cautioning hand on max's arm. ashoka seems just the slight bit uneasy dealing with max and so keeps trying to direct himself to joan. he smokes a long indian cigarette.}
<C>__{ashoka}
<D>__{the entire package we're proposing will cost you three thousand rupees a month.}
<A>__{joan is taken aback by the sum.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{if we pay you that, we won't have any money for supplies.}
<C>__{ashoka}
<D>__{i'm told you're very resourceful.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i think i see a solution. may i? what if we were to work out a profit sharing arrangement? we give you a share of our net profit.}
<C>__{ashoka}
<D>__{how do you expect to make a profit off of lepers and the poor, doctor?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{beats the hell outta me, asshole. but you've obviously found a way.}
<A>__{the question would seem to be whether ashoka will have max killed here or outside the house. his eyes on max, ashoka puts the cigarette out against the back of his hand... and smiles at max.}
