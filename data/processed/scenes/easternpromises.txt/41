<L>__{exterior the banks of the thames next morning}
<D>__{somewhere within sight of the thames barrier. a dozen policemen and forensic investigators are milling round on a shale beach, the icy waters of the thames lapping at their feet.}
<L>__{interior forensic tent morning}
<D>__{a large tent has been erected over the body of soyka. inside the tent two senior police officers await the arrival of a third man, a specialist from the russian desk (yuri), who is not dressed for the weather. he has obviously been dragged out of bed. he is led to the side of the body. one of the officers pulls up the dead man's hand and shows him the eagle tattoo.}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{we think he might be russian mafia. yuri studies the tattoo, then borrows a torch. he crouches to push up the wet trouser leg on the corpse's right leg. when the knee is exposed in torch light we see a small star tattooed on the knee cap.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{he is actually a chechen. he is also a member of the vory v zakone. the stars on the knees mean he would never kneel before anyone. yuri opens the dead man's shirt and we see a tattoo of an eight pointed star on his chest.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{in russian prisons, your life story is written on your body in tattoos. you don't exist without tattoos.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{he was a captain. he then checks out the fingers in the torchlight and we glimpse that the finger tips have been sawn off.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{but he has been processed professionally. yuri straightens and grabs a paper towel to wipe his hands.}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{there was something else. it was... inside the body. chest cavity. the officer holds up a small zip lock bag which has a handwritten note sealed inside it. the handwriting is just visible through the wet cellophane.}
