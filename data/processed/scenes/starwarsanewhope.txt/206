<L>__{interior main hangar deck luke's ship}
<A>__{luke, leia, and dodonna meet under a huge space fighter.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{oh, it's han! i don't know, i really thought he'd change his mind.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{he's got to follow his own path. no one can choose it for him.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i only wish ben were here.}
<A>__{leia gives luke a little kiss, turns, and goes off. as luke heads for his ship, another pilot rushes up to him and grabs his arm.}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{luke! i don't believe it! how'd you get here... are you going out with us?!}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{biggs! of course, i will be up there with you! listen, have i got some stories to tell...}
<A>__{red leader, a rugged handsome man in his forties, comes up behind luke and biggs. he has the confident smile of a born leader.}
<C>__{red leader}
<D>__{are you... luke skywalker? have you been checked out on the incom t sixty five?}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{sir, luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories.}
<A>__{red leader pats luke on the back as they stop in front of his fighter.}
<C>__{red leader}
<D>__{i met your father once when i was just a boy, he was a great pilot. you'll do all right. if you've got half of your father's skill, you'll do better than all right.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{thank you, sir. i will try.}
<A>__{red leader hurries to his own ship.}
<C>__{biggs}
<D>__{i've got to get aboard. listen, you'll tell me your stories when we come back. all right?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i told you i'd make it someday, biggs.}
<C>__{biggs}
<P>__{(going off)}
<D>__{you did, all right. it's going to be like old times, luke. we're a couple of shooting stars that'll never be stopped!}
<A>__{luke laughs and shakes his head in agreement. he heads for his ship. as luke begins to climb up the ladder into his sleek, deadly spaceship, the crew chief, who is working on the craft, points to little artoo, who is being hoisted into a socket on the back of the fighter.}
<C>__{chief}
<D>__{this r2 unit of your seems a bit beat up. do you want a new one?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{not on your life! that little droid and i have been through a lot together.}
<P>__{(to artoo)}
<D>__{you okay, artoo?}
<A>__{the crewmen lower artoo detoo into the craft. now a part of the exterior shell of the starship, the little droid beeps that he is fine. luke climbs up into the cockpit of his fighter and puts an his helmet. threepio looks on from the floor of the massive hangar as the crewmen secure his little electronic partner into luke's x wing. it's an emotional filled moment as artoo beeps good bye.}
<C>__{chief}
<D>__{okay, easy she goes!}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{hang on tight,artoo, you've got to come back.}
<A>__{artoo beeps in agreement.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{you wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?}
<A>__{artoo whistles his reply. all final preparations are made for the approaching battle. the hangar is buzzing with the last minute activity as the pilots and crewmen alike make their final adjustments. the hum of activity is occasionally trespassed by the distorted voice of the loudspeaker issuing commands. coupling hoses are disconnected from the ships as they are fueled. cockpit shields roll smoothly into place over each pilot. a signalman, holding red guiding lights, directs the ships. luke, a trace of a smile gracing his lips, peers about through his goggles.}
<C>__{ben's voice}
<D>__{luke, the force will be with you.}
<A>__{luke is confused at the voice and taps his headphones.}
