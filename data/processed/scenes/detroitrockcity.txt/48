<A>__{mrs. bruce exits the building and approaches her car. she stops when she sees the '78 brown volvo parked behind her. it's empty. she shrugs and gets into her car, driving off. inside the volvo hawk, trip, and lex poke their heads up. the coast is clear so they can sit straight again. they stare up at a second story window where they see part of jam's profile.}
