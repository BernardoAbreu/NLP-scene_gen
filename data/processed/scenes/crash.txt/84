<L>__{interior tattoo parlor night}
<A>__{james enters to discover vaughan getting a wound tattoo on his abdomen, one that looks as though it could have been made by the fluted lower edge of a plastic steering wheel. the woman giving vaughan the tattoo is sexless and professional. she could be a nurse or a hospital dietician. james sits next to them, barely acknowledged by the woman. vaughan has messy papers spread out in front of him that include stylized sketches of famous crash wounds, photos of andy warhol's scars, automotive styling detail drawings from a 50s detroit design studio.}

<P>__{(to tattooist)}
<D>__{you're making it too clean.}
<C>__{tattooist}
<D>__{medical tattoos are supposed to be clean.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{this isn't a medical tattoo. this is a prophetic tattoo. prophesy is dirty and ragged. make it dirty and ragged.}
<C>__{tattooist}
<P>__{(a hint of sarcasm)}
<D>__{prophetic? is this personal prophesy or global prophesy?}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{there's no difference. james i want you to let her give you this one.}
<A>__{vaughan spreads out a stained scrap of paper as though it were a sacred piece of parchment. on it is a fiercely sketched wound that looks as though it were made by the lincoln's hood ornament.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{where do you think that one should go?}
<A>__{vaughan spreads his legs in a mechanical, unsexual way and grabs the right inner thigh of his greasy jeans.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{it should go here.}
