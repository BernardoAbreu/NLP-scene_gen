<L>__{interior party house living room night}
<A>__{norah and lynn sit on a ratty couch in a crowded smoke filled room. next to them, a flannel wearing burn out rocks to headphones. norah wears a candy necklace. debauchery plays out around them.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{i knew you wouldn't have any fun here.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{i am having fun.}
<A>__{norah takes a tug on the joint and passes it to lynn.}

<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{yeah, no thanks.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{straight edge?}
<C>__{lynn}
<P>__{(shakes head)}
<D>__{just kind of superstitious.}
<A>__{norah nods and passes the joint across lynn to the burn out. the burn out tugs and passes it back to lynn. lynn waves it off a second time.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{she's mormon.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{i'm not mormon. i just... you're gonna think it's weird.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{sometimes i think that when you get high or drink or alter your consciousness like that }
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{you don't drink?}
<A>__{lynn shakes her head.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{i think it weakens you psychically... like it creates these cracks and then bad things can seep in and maybe never go away.}
<A>__{norah stares at lynn with great blood shot concentration.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{all right, you're kind of freakin me out.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{you should just tell people you're mormon.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{i think your boyfriend is winning.}
<A>__{two women gnaw at randy's neck. his necklace is almost empty.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{yes. yes, he is.}
<A>__{lynn lightly tugs on norah's candy necklace. she leans in close and takes a bite of the candy. norah catches her breath. paralyzed. lynn smiles, pleased by norah's reaction.}
<C>__{lynn}
<P>__{(whisper)}
<D>__{breathe.}
<A>__{norah snaps back.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{i need more beer.}
<A>__{norah pulls herself off the couch and starts for the keg. she stops. turns.}
<C>__{norah}
