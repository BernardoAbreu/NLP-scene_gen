<A>__{close on a shooter of tequila being poured. camera adjusting to reveal the attractive barmaid tipping the bottle. pushing it across the bar to where two empty shooters sit, making the exchange.}
<C>__{barmaid}
<D>__{i'd say this about exceeds your minimum daily requirement.}
<A>__{the person she's talking to us:}
<B>__{mulder}
<A>__{he sits by himself on a stool, staring down at the bar. staring at the shooter which he spins with his fingers.}
<C>__{barmaid}
<D>__{gotta train for this kind of heavy lifting.}
<A>__{mulder tosses back the shooter anyway. she watches him as she retrieves the small shot glass, intrigued by his dark silence.}
<C>__{barmaid}
<D>__{poopy day?}

<C>__{barmaid}
<D>__{a woman?}

<A>__{mulder nods, pointing to the tequila bottle again. the barmaid agrees to pour another one, reluctantly.}
<B>__{angle over to a man at the end of the bar}
<A>__{staring at mulder intently. he's older than mulder, dressed in an old brooke brothers light summer suit. mulder notices him, feels his gaze, but doesn't give it thought. resume barmaid, mulder}
<C>__{barmaid}
<D>__{what do you do?}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{what do i do.}
<P>__{(off her curious look)}
<D>__{i'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. an annoyance to my superiors. a joke among my peers. "spooky," they call me. spooky mulder. whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who'll listen that the fix is in. that our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy. that the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time.}
<A>__{she stares at him for a moment, startled by his drunken screed. she pulls back the shooter she's just poured mulder.}
<C>__{barmaid}
<D>__{i think that about does it, spooky.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{does what?}
<C>__{barmaid}
<D>__{why don't you go home to the old lady }
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{sorry. don't have one.}
<A>__{mulder slides off his stool, noticing: mulder's pov the watchful man is gone.}
<B>__{resume mulder}
<A>__{he feints toward the door, then reverses direction. heads to the back of the place.}
