<C>__{vig}
<D>__{his name is walter.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{did you good soldiers present this map to captain van meter?}
<C>__{troy}
<D>__{not yet.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{then i will take it to him.}
<A>__{troy stands and grabs the map.}
<C>__{troy}
<D>__{we'll take it to him. sir.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{it won't do either of us any good then, will it?}
<C>__{troy}
<D>__{he's our commander, sir. we'd have to tell him you took it.}
<A>__{both troy and archie hold the map, staring at each other. everyone is tense.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{it could be nothing but a sandy love letter from one eye raqi to another }
<C>__{troy}
<D>__{it's a series of bunkers near karbala.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{maybe.}
<C>__{troy}
<D>__{not maybe, definitely. recon photos match the map.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{may i look at the goddamn map?}
<A>__{troy lets go. archie holds the map up to the light. he then pours some of doc's rubbing alcohol on the map, and holds it to the light again. he puts the map on the table, turns the light off and clicks on an infra red flashlight he pulls out. a completely different map appears in green markings.}

<D>__{dag.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{that's what makes rangers badass, we get the best flashlights.}
<A>__{they stare at the new map in the infrared glow, captivated.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{still looks like a series of three bunkers in three villages. a bit farther to the west.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{seventy five klicks north.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{more like 65.}
<C>__{troy}
<D>__{much closer to karbala.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{leave at dawn, back by lunch, not a big deal. of course }
<A>__{he turns the overhead light back on.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{ there could be nothing inside but starving arabs and stolen watches, but i think it's worth checking out, even if i have to do it with clueless reservists like you.}
<A>__{they look at him.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{i mean, i could take the map, but you could talk, it starts to become a pain in the ass for me, so we'll do the gold together.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{what gold?}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{you don't even know what's inside these bunkers, do you?}
<C>__{vig}
<D>__{rolexes.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{rolexes are swell, but i'm talking about kuwaiti bullion.}
<C>__{vig}
<D>__{you mean the little cubes you put in hot water for soup?}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{no. not the little cubes you put in hot water for soup.}
<C>__{troy}
<D>__{gold bricks.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{5 kilos each, $50,000 in today's market.}
<C>__{vig}
<D>__{for one gold brick?}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{i'm sure mr. hussein has divided his bricks. into many different hiding places, but just one hiding place should be easy to take, and that would be enough to get us out of our day jobs. unless the three kings are in love with their day jobs.}
