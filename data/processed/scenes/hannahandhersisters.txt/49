<A>__{the quiet continues as the film cuts to a close up of a large, circular cat scan module in an antiseptic hospital room. a slowly moving stretcher, bearing mickey's strapped prone body, begins to enter the round opening of the module. as the camera pulls back from mickey, his taped head under the scan, two technicians can be seen through the window separating the scanner from the control room. one of them, sitting down, taps information into a computer while the other technician stands nearby, looking from mickey to the computer screen. the movie then cuts briefly to the computer screen, showing an image of mickey's skull. scan lines bleep over the skull. the camera moves up from the screen to reveal mickey once again, as seen through the window, silent and serious under the cat scan module. from mickey's prone form, the film moves to the two technicians, as seen through the window in the scanner room. they examine the computer screen and talk indistinctly to each other. one of the men, nodding, taps more information into the computer. while they're studying the cat scan picture, the camera cuts to a back view of mickey under the module. there is a science fiction feel to this scene, as if mickey is lying in the center of a huge, white, futuristic circle. the stretcher, bearing mickey, slowly moves out of the module.}
