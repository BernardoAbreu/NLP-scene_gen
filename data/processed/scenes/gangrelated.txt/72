<L>__{interior police lineup room day}
<A>__{rows of seats face a small platform. the lineup wall is striped with horizontal lines with height numbers. the brightly lighted lineup is separated from the gallery, which is in the dark. uniformed guards are on hand to make sure there is no discussion, verbal or otherwise, between accused and witness. six men file onto the platform. all shady characters.}
<C>__{a voice}
<D>__{stop and face front.}
<A>__{the six men obey. a couple keep their heads down. the others squint from the bright lights.}
<C>__{the voice}
<D>__{lift your heads, look straight.}
<A>__{heads are lifted. eyes front. but we only recognize one of them, standing third from the left. it's joe. divinci, rodriguez and cynthia are in the gallery.}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{take your time. try and remember his face.}
<A>__{cynthia counts three from the left and... wait a minute. she looks more closely. just to be sure. rodriguez and divinci watch her. she's obviously putting on a good show. then she turns to divinci, sitting next to her and whispers }
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i know him.}
<A>__{divinci is caught a little of guard he didn't expect a private conversation, nor does he want one for fear of it looking like he's coaching her.}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{if you can identify the man }
<C>__{cynthia}
<P>__{(whisper)}
<D>__{i know him.}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{just tell us which one.}
<A>__{cynthia, frustrated, gives divinci a look.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{no. i fucking know him.}
<A>__{divinci still isn't sure what's gotten into her. rodriguez looks over, a little annoyed.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{what's the problem?}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{there's no problem!}
<P>__{(to cynthia; pointedly)}
<D>__{do you see him up there?!}
<C>__{cynthia}
<P>__{(aside)}
<D>__{you don't understand.}
<A>__{divinci is losing his patience. he doesn't want to blow the whole thing now, not in front of guards and police personnel. the guards are beginning to wonder what the hell's going on. so are the men in the line.}
<C>__{one of the men}
<D>__{hey, come on, do it or don't!}
<C>__{the voice}
<D>__{no talking.}
<A>__{divinci leans in close to her. we can hear grumbling from the men on the platform.}
<C>__{divinci}
<D>__{pick the asshole out!}
<A>__{cynthia starts to protest again, but she suddenly feels divinci's hand grip her arm. he's had enough. cynthia gets the message. and while keeping her eyes locked on divinci she says }
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{third man from the left.}
<B>__{joe}
<A>__{squints against the harsh light, trying to see into the room, as if he recognized the voice.}
