<L>__{interior foyer, parrish townhouse (later) day}
<A>__{joe and susan are at the front door, he has helped her on with her coat, she turns around, they kiss. the kiss lingers, susan breaks away, reaches for the door, looks back longingly at joe and then she is gone, joe closing the door softly after her. he turns back into the foyer, looks up, parrish is on the balcony, it is clear he has observed joe and susan.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{hello, bill.}
<A>__{parrish, in a state of shock, doesn't answer for a moment.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{did you have a nice nap?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i couldn't sleep.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i'm sorry to hear that.}
<A>__{he starts up the stairs.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{no, i will come down}
<A>__{joe waits guardedly at the bottom of the stairs as parrish descends.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{what's going on?}
<A>__{joe senses parrish's tone, doesn't answer.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{i saw you kiss susan.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yes, i saw you see me.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i will be the judge of that.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i'm her father!}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{with all due respect, bill, i'm not asking your permission.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{well, you goddam well should. you walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{'spooning'?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{yes, and stop repeating everything i sai, and turning it into a question. spooning, fooling around, god knows what. you arrive on the scene why you picked me, i still don't under stand }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i picked you for your verve, your excellence, and for your ability to how shall i say instruct. you've lived a first rate life. and i find it eminently usable.}
<A>__{parrish measures joe.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<A>__{joe doesn't answer, riveted now on parrish.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{everybody wants something, joe. you've been taking me from pillar to post here. i thought i knew who you were, and it wasn't a whole lot of fun, however it was almost bear able. now i'm getting something else from you, something very, very strange what is it that you want, joe?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i'm only following the parrish bywords. looking for that 'ounce of excitement', that 'whisper of a thrill' what there is no sense living your life without. you know what i mean, bill.}
<A>__{parrish's jaw sets.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{you're violating the laws of the universe.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{this universe?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{any universe that exists or ever existed. you may be the pro, joe. but i know who you are. and you're all fucked up.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i don't like your tone, and i don't like your references.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{and i don't give a shit.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{may i remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me. so watch it...bill.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{cut the 'bill' crap out you sonofabitch.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i told you, 'watch it'.}
<A>__{silence. now joe turns on his heel, heads right out the front door. parrish is left solitary, confounded, staring at the closed door.}
