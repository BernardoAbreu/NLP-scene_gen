<L>__{interior expensive restaurant bar night}
<A>__{richard worth has his back to the bar. he's a blue blood trial lawyer with an ego that has more horsepower than a ferrari.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{it's all in my patented sideways glance. like this...}
<A>__{he gives a sideways glance to stella; it's their first date.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{i hit each woman on the jury with one of these. we make contact. and i know exactly what they're doing. undressing me with their eyes.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{i see...}
<A>__{what a nightmare. someone bumps into stella, a mumbled, "excuse me." nightmare continues...}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{the case is all but won. that's why in jury selection i choose as many women as possible. except lesbians, of course. i can tell in sixty seconds if they're a lesbian. want to know how i know?}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{if they don't undress you with their eyes?}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{precisely. like that waitress right there. see? she's looking at me right below my belt. definitely not a lesbian.}
<A>__{a waitress is indeed looking below richard's belt. but stella notices that she was only looking because richard's zipper is all the way down. she smiles.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{your fly.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{i am fly. and i'm da bomb. just wait until later tonight.}
<A>__{suddenly a busboy stumbles and a tray of drinks fall, soaking richard's suit in red wine.}
<C>__{busboy}
<D>__{oh, man. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{you should be. moron. what the hell's wrong with you?}
<C>__{busboy}
<D>__{it was an accident. i'm very sorry.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{where's the manager? richard worth is not paying to have his suit cleaned. damn.}
<P>__{(to stella)}
<D>__{i'm going to... i don't believe this.}
<A>__{he starts off to the bathroom and as soon as the space he was occupying empties, charlie fills it.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i think your date's going pretty well, what do you think?}
<A>__{she shoots him a look that could reverse global warming.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what do you mean? i come here all the time.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{sure. lawyers, judges, my kind of crowd. see that gentleman there, he sentenced me to 90 days in county once. we need to talk.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{no, you need to listen. i want you to leave. got it?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{hey, i paid valet parking prices to get in here, not to mention a twenty spot to the busboy to spill that drink on mister zipper.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{you i don't believe this. you paid someone to spill that drink?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{actually, you paid for it.}
<A>__{charlie returns her wallet.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{didn't notice it was me who bumped into you earlier, did you? anyway, i was hoping we could get to know each other a little better before we leave for los angeles. i already booked your flight.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{you truly are a fatuous, odious man.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i have no idea what you just said, but i like the sound of it.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{well maybe you'll understand this. hit the road, jack }
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{charlie }
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{or you'll be sorry, charlie, cause i will kick you in the nuts so hard that your voice will be as high as my heels.}
<A>__{she means it, too.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i'm beginning to worry about this whole relationship.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{i will let you in on a secret. you can't have a relationship with a pickpocket, gold robber, or any kind of thief.}
<A>__{charlie looks away, lets her have her pointerior this whole thing is getting pretty heated so when he turns back to her, he uses a whole new approach. his emotions are genuine.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{john wasn't just a man i crewed up with, he was my friend, he was the closest thing to a father i ever had. i wish to god i could bring him back. but all i can do is go after this guy, the guy that killed him, and hit him where he lives.}
<A>__{she feels the honesty in his words but before she can reply, they're interrupted by }
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{everything alright, stella?}
<A>__{he's back, red wine splotched on his suit.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{fine. richard. charlie. charlie was just saying goodbye.}
<A>__{but for now, charlie is just staring at richard, boring into to him...}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{can i help you with something?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{oh, sorry. i was just undressing you with my eyes.}
<A>__{and with that, charlie goes. stella can't help but smile.}
