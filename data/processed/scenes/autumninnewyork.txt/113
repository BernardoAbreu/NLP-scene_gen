<L>__{exterior manhattan street nightfall}
<A>__{wills emerges from charlotte's brownstone, hails a cab, then decides against it.}
<L>__{exterior city streets nightfall}
<A>__{head down, eyes desolate, wills walks uptown. the roaring traffic, dense crowds, blaring music, flashing neon the great welter of urban life is entirely lost on him. he can think only of charlotte.}
<L>__{exterior hell's kitchen night}
<A>__{wills walks down a dark block, his jacket open to the cold night wind, his cheeks and ears burned red.}
