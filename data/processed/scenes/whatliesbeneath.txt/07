<L>__{interior hallway day}
<A>__{claire bends down to pick up one of caitlin's socks. when she stands, something catches her eye out a window. she gazes down, transfixed.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{through a stand of trees over a high wooden fence, a young couple is in the midst of a heated argument next door. claire watches as the husband, a large imposing man with an unruly shock of red hair, snarls at his wife across the hood of their huge old buick. she tries to get a glimpse of the woman, but all that's visible is the back of her blond head. a tan, sinewy arm encircles claire's waist. she lets out a small gasp as a hand closes on her breast. it's claire's husband, dr. norman spencer, nibbling gently at her neck. he's older than she, pushing fifty, with silver streaks beginning to permeate the shaggy mop of hair that makes him look more like a preppy rocker or a lacrosse coach than the prominent academic that he is. claire, however, can't take her eyes off the scene below.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{they at it again?}
<A>__{claire nods.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{christ, that's twice in...when did they move in?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i think three...}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{three weeks.}
<A>__{she continues to gaze downward. the man leans over the hood, murmuring darkly at his wife, though for claire and norman the scene is entirely silent.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{what's their name?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{feur, i think. psych department. figures. they're all psychotic.}
<A>__{outside, mr. feur turns and walks toward his house. norman begins, once again, to nuzzle claire. her eyes close, but then she gently demurs.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{she's awake.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{we'll be quiet. quick and quiet.}
<A>__{she turns to him.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i don't want to be either.}
<A>__{he smiles. a really good smile. the lips and tongue on his faded t shirt mark him as a 'stones fan.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{when's she out of here?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{norman spencer.}
<A>__{norman gives up. he busses her cheek.}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(moving toward the stairs)}
<D>__{alright. i can't take the rejection. i'm going to class.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{don't.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{claire, i have to show up for the }
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{it's saturday.}
<A>__{norman stops.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i knew that. you think i didn't know that?}
<A>__{she smiles at him. after a beat:}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{it's today?}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(wistfully)}
<D>__{yep.}
<A>__{they share a warm, poignant look. he turns and moves down the stairs.}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(calling over his shoulder)}
<D>__{we're going to have to leave by three if we want to beat the traffic.}
<A>__{claire returns her gaze to the scene below as mr. feur says something ominous to his wife, then stalks into the house.}
<C>__{norman }
<D>__{claire?}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(absently)}
<D>__{three o'clock.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{mrs. feur drops her face into her hands.}
