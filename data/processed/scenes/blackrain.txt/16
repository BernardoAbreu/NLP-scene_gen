<L>__{interior lime house chinatown night}
<A>__{the lime house is a little piece of italy in the heart of chinatown, and tonight, it's packed. any selection on the jukebox that isn't frank sinatra is jerry vale. behind the bar are two fat brothers. one pours drinks, the other dishes out scungilli. it's three a.m. it's always three a.m. at the lime house.}
<B>__{at the back table}
<A>__{our man cavello is unloading steaming scungilli onto an already heaping plate in front of an imperious looking japanese man. the japanese man, in his mid fifties, wears a gray suit, and not a strand of his jet black hair is out of place. a japanese translator, doing his best to translate cavello's heavily accented english, sits between them.}
<B>__{at the bar}
<A>__{charlie is looking straight ahead, afraid cavello might peg him. nick is at ease.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what are they doing now?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{eating scungilli, just like the last time you asked.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{who do you think the jap is?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{maybe cavello's buying a subaru. how would i know?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i don't blame you for being sore. it'll pass when we bag him.}
<A>__{charlie, trying to relax, gestures toward his foot.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{whatdaya think? 'bostonians'. eighty five bucks.}
<P>__{(lowering his voice)}
<D>__{girls go for shoes. second place they look.}
<P>__{(off nick's reaction)}
<D>__{hey, i read it in a magazine.}
<A>__{nick's attention is drawn to a trio walking in the door.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(dead serious)}
<D>__{charlie, don't do anything. promise me?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{what they see: two bodyguards are making a quick sweep of the bar. frank abolofia, s stocky man with silver grey hair, sweeps in behind them. abolofia has mitts like a meat packer and a fifty dollar manicure. a heavyweight mafioso.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{frank abolofia.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{the wolf?}
<A>__{abolofia walks to cavello's table. all rise and shake hands. the two hitters take seats at the bar. the two brothers scramble to serve their distinguished guests.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(in a whisper)}
<D>__{some party.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{maybe we should do something?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm.}
<A>__{nick turns away, resumes his drink. nick's pov in the mirror behind the bar: two new japanese men step in the door. early twenties, spiky hair, dark versace suits.}
<B>__{number one}
<A>__{wears tortoise shell shades. he coolly checks out the room then nods to }
<B>__{number two}
<A>__{who pulls a spas 12, automatic shotgun from under his coat, and spits out three rounds. a window shatters. everyone hits the floor.}
<B>__{number one}
<A>__{slowly walks toward cavello's table.}
<B>__{number two}
<A>__{covers the floor. abolofia's bodyguards show their empty hands.}
<B>__{nick and charlie}
<A>__{on the floor. they don't have the artillery for this guy either.}
<B>__{at the table}
<A>__{our japanese businessman knows these people. he eyes them contemptuously. abolofia has put enough people in this situation to be philosophical about it. he stops chewing. a tiny hand motion to his bodyguards is enough to stop any precipitous action.}
<C>__{number one}
<P>__{(in japanese)}
<D>__{give it to me.}
<A>__{the japanese businessman looking straight ahead. a long, silent pause... then, still not facing him:}
<C>__{businessman}
<P>__{(in japanese)}
<D>__{go to hell.}
<A>__{number one slips his fingers beneath his shades, massaging his eyes. in a flash, he pulls a shuto from under his coat. the 18 inch blade gleams like a neon tube. he presses the tip of the blade against the businessman's throat.}
<B>__{charlie}
<A>__{his hand close around the grip of the beretta. he unsnaps the ankle holster. the snap can be heard across the room. nick's hand closes around charlie's and squeezes till the knuckles turn white.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(in a whisper)}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{saving your life.}
<B>__{number two}
<A>__{levels the scattergun at nick and charlie. at the table number one calmly holds the blade at the man's throat as he reaches into the man's jacket and removes a small, rectangular, plastic wrapped parcel. he feels its weight, then flips it to number two. abolofia, realizing that whatever is going on doesn't affect him or his, resumes eating.}
<C>__{abolofia}
<D>__{you people are wild... wild.}
<A>__{number one backs the blade off. the man raises his napkin to the small wound. a droplet of blood has stained his shirt collar. number one turns around as if to leave. what happens next could be a whim, an after thought. number one spins around and thrusts the blade deep into the man's chest. he withdraws it with a half twist, and in the same motion fatally slashes the translator's throat before the old man's body hits the floor. blood pours from the businessman's mouth onto his scungilli, spreading across the white cloth and onto the floor.}
<B>__{cavello}
<A>__{reaches for a gun under his coat. but number two pumps two rounds into his face. at this range, there's not much left. the killers slowly back out the door, covering the room with the scattergun. the minute the door shuts, nick leaps up, pulling his shield and revolver.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{police officers. everybody stay put.}
<P>__{(to charlie)}
<D>__{get back up.}
<A>__{abolofia's eyebrows rise at this development. nick bolts out the door leaving charlie in charge. he's never been in charge before.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(nervously showing shield)}
<D>__{police.}
