<L>__{interior seymour & joe's garage sale day}
<A>__{they see the garage sale, in progress. they've all spotted each other.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{what should we do? what if he recognizes us?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{come on, it's too late now...}
<A>__{a middle aged housewife browses with little enthusiasm as enid & rebecca tentatively approach. enid spots a mongoose vs. cobra taxidermy piece near joe...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{ew, look at this...}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{gross!}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{i think it's cute look at his little weasel teeth.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{ew, it's like some gross rat...}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(hardly looking up from tv)}
<D>__{it's a mongoose.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{mm...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{a what?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{a mongoose... they eat snakes... you never heard of a mongoose? that's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy. nobody alive today knows how to do work like that.}
<C>__{enid}
<P>__{(looking underneath it)}
<D>__{how much is this?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{umm... that's not officially for sale... i might have to hang onto that for the time being.}
<A>__{joe shuts off the tv. he turns to the girls, not wanting to lose the rapport he's established with two potential customers.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{so, are you looking for anything in particular? there's a lot of other stuff in storage...}
<A>__{he picks up a plastic casio type guitar keyboard (a child's toy) and starts noodling pre programmed rock licks.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{perhaps the "jam in ator" appeals to you. absolutely no practice necessary. you shread like a giant. just press a button.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{that's okay...}
<A>__{she notices several modern jazz lps on joe's table.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{do you have any other old records besides these?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{seymour does.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{who does?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{him. seymour. he's the man with the records.}
<A>__{enid glances at rebecca and mouths the implausible name: "seymour?!" rebecca snorts, unable to control her laughter, and turns away from the table. enid keeps her cool...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{do you have any old indian records?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{indian records?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{you know, like weird 1960's indian rock n' roll music.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{i don't have anything after about 1935. i may have one hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. i don't really collect "foreign."}
<A>__{enid drifts over and begins thumbing through a box of 78s.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{those are all 78s... can you play 78s?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{sure!... wait, maybe not 78s, but i can play regular records...}
<A>__{he points her to a nearby box of lps.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{there's some good stuff in here... do you like old music?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{sure, i guess.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{well there's a few choice lps in here that re issue some really great old blues stuff.}
<A>__{rebecca tugs on enid's sleeve. enid gets free and continues looking through the records. she stops on one with an especially wacky cover.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{is this one any good?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{nah, it's not so great. here's the one i'd recommend.}
<A>__{he pulls out a bland looking record: "collector's items, volume three." rebecca shifts impatiently behind her.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{this track alone by memphis minnie is worth about $500 if you have the original 78. she was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived, and a great singer and songwriter as well. i know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{wow!}
<A>__{rebecca snorts at enid's over exuberance. enid kicks her.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{how much is it?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{a dollar seventy five.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{she pays him.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{if you don't like it bring it back for a refund. we're here every saturday.}
<A>__{he puts the record into a bag.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{i'm sure it's fine.}
