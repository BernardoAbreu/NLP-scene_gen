<L>__{exterior the street outside}
<A>__{we're almost on top of the phone booth, the phone is still ringing as a hand reaches into frame and snatches the phone from its cradle.}
<C>__{a woman's voice }
<P>__{(a touch irish accent)}
<D>__{yes?}
<A>__{another angle and we see a woman named deirdre on the phone: striking, dark haired, irish. she carries herself with the same professional edge as the men inside the bar. deirdre listens for a moment to the voice on the other end, and before she speaks she sense something a silhouette stands in the shadows of the bar, watching deirdre. she gives this silhouette a measure glance before speaking, her hand creeping ever so slightly towards her coat.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{can i help you?}
<A>__{the silhouette steps into a pool of light. this is sam. tough, lean, enigmatic. somebody you might trust, but whom you'd never cross. sam returns her look before he speaks.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no...}
<A>__{sam moves towards the bar, and deirdre returns to her phone conversation.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{i'm here...}
<P>__{(a beat, responding to a question)}
<D>__{no, it was nothing.}
