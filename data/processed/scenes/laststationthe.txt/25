<L>__{exterior yasnaya polyana. grounds. day.}
<A>__{sofya, sasha, valentin, andrey, tolstoy's son, and tolstoy all clustered around a table taking tea. dushan stands near the group fiddling with a gramophone that sits on a small table.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{these people have nothing.}
<C>__{dushan}
<D>__{it really is the most extraordinary thing.}
<A>__{absolutely ignoring him.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{it's not for lack of land that the muzhiks live in poverty. they have no will power and they drink too much.}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{i'm not suggesting they be given land. private property is the root of the problem... we should be giving ours away.}
<C>__{andrey}
<D>__{give it to whom?}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{it's all ridiculous. you think that poverty makes the peasants somehow morally superior.}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{i believe that wealth corrupts us all, yes i do.}
<A>__{a pause. valentin fills the silence.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{it's a keystone of the movement.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{oh, i know all about the movement.}
<A>__{a pause. valentin notices that people from the front lawn have moved up to watch all this. life in the fishbowl, the tolstoys seem neither to notice nor care.}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{if the peasants had money, they wouldn't surround themselves, as we do, with footmen costing ten rubles a month.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{no, they'd spend it on drink and whores.}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{valentin fedorovich, do you think fifty years from now, people will eat while grown men walk around and wait on them hand and foot?}
<A>__{valentin doesn't know what to say. a giggle from dushan.}
<C>__{dushan}
<D>__{oh, that's good...that's good.}
<A>__{dushan, having sat at table, tries surreptitiously to get down tolstoy's words in the diary he holds below the table. sofya flushes with anger.}
<C>__{valentin}
<P>__{i think...(sneeze)}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{stop scribbling!}
<P>__{(points to her husband)}
<D>__{you all think he's christ, don't you? he thinks he's christ.}
<A>__{there is an awkward pause.}
<C>__{dushan}
<P>__{(flustered)}
<D>__{i'm not...i don't believe leo nikolayevich is christ. christ is christ but...}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{but what?}
<C>__{dushan}
<D>__{i believe he's one of the prophets. god speaks through him. i recognize the cadence in his voice.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{this is unbearable. no wonder i feel lonely. i'm surrounded by morrons.}
<C>__{sasha}
<D>__{mama, you're being ridiculous.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{am i? i sit here and listen to this talk of love and god and equality, knowing full well that count generosity here is fully prepared to give away everything we have.}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<P>__{(exhausted)}
<D>__{you keep going on like that...why do you think we should profit from the work i m doing which is only meant for the sake of the people.}
<A>__{she turns to see dushan scribbling again.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{stop it! stop writing now!}
<A>__{valentin glances at sasha, uncomfortable at these outbursts. a long pause. dushan tries to relieve the tension.}
<C>__{dushan}
<D>__{in defense of my gift, let me demonstrate. it's quite remarkable, really.}
<A>__{he gets up, places a record on the gramophone, needle on the record. what comes forth is not music, but tolstoy's voice. it is a recording of a recent speech against capital punishment. his voice booms, tinny and distorted. dushan walks to the machine, stares at it in awe. valentin is completely caught up in the technology.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{it's your voice. it's wonderful.}
<A>__{they all listen for a moment, look to tolstoy for a response.}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{it's tiresome. another remarkable invention will supercede it.}
<A>__{valentin blushes and looks at the table. dushan tries to hide his disappointment.}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{please excuse me.}
<A>__{tolstoy rises, leaves the table, walks out onto the lawn. dushan gets up quickly, bumping the table as he goes. tea spills. valentin moves to wipe it up, sneezes, a barrage of irritable blessings.}
<C>__{dushan}
<D>__{leo nikolayevich is something of a luddite, i fear.}
<A>__{sofya crosses to the machine, removes the record from the gramophone, replaces it with another dushan has brought. suddenly, the air is filled with the final duet from mozart's il nozze di figaro. she returns to her place. there is a long moment where all take in the sublimity of it. tolstoy walks slowly back to the table. he stands completely still. tears fill his eyes and roll down his cheeks.}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{oh, that s better. that s nice. very nice indeed.}
<A>__{sofya crosses to her husband, wipes the tears off his face. valentin watches as they embrace.}
<C>__{valentin }
<D>__{do your parents often speak to each other so...bluntly?}
