<L>__{interior dinner room night}
<A>__{the dining room of bill's house. the family, mother father and daughter, sit at the dinner table eating.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{b.b., don't you think mommy has the prettiest hair in the whole wide world?}
<C>__{b.b.}
<D>__{yes i do.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{in fact it's better than pretty. what's better than pretty?}
<C>__{b.b.}
<D>__{gorgeous.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{very good, gorgeous. mommy is gorgeous.}
<A>__{the bride shows no sign of thawing around bill.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you know baby, mommy's kinda mad at daddy.}
<C>__{b.b.}
<D>__{why? where you a bad daddy?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i'm afraid i was. i was a real bad daddy.}
<P>__{(to mommy)}
<D>__{our little girl learned about life and death the other day.}
<P>__{(to b.b.)}
<D>__{you want to tell mommy about what happened to emilio?}
<C>__{b.b.}
<D>__{i killed him. i didn't mean to, but i stepped on him and he stopped moving.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{emilio was her goldfish. she came running into my room holding the fish in her hand, crying, "daddy daddy, emilio's dead." and i said, "really, that's so sad. how did he die?" and what did you say?}
<C>__{b.b.}
<D>__{i stepped on him.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{actually young lady, the words you so strategically used were, "i accidentally stepped on him." right?}
<C>__{b.b.}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{to which i queried, "and just how did your foot accidentally find its way into emilio's fishbowl?" and she told me no no no, emilio was on the carpet when she stepped on him.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{hummmmmm, the plot thickens. and just how did emilio get on the carpet? and mommy, you would have been real proud of her, because she didn't lie. she said she took emilio out of his bowl, and put him on the carpet. and what was emilio doing on the carpet, baby?}
<C>__{b.b.}
<D>__{he was flapping.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{and then you stomped on him?}
<C>__{b.b.}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{and when you lifted your foot up, what was emilio doing then?}
<C>__{b.b.}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{he stopped flapping, didn't he?}
<C>__{b.b.}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{and you knew what that meant, didn't you?}
<C>__{b.b.}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{what did that mean?}
<C>__{b.b.}
<D>__{he was dead.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(to mommy)}
<D>__{she told me later, that the second she lifted up her foot and saw him not flapping, she knew he was dead. is that not the perfect visual image of life and death? a fish flapping on the carpet, and a fish not flapping on the carpet. so powerful even a five year old child with no concept of life and death knew what it meant. not only did she know emilio was dead, she knew she had killed him. so she comes running into my room, holding emilio in both of her little hands it was so cute and she wanted me to make emilio better. and i asked her, why did she step on emilio? and she said, she didn't know. but i knew why. you didn't mean to hurt emilio, you just wanted to see what would happen if you stepped on him, right?}
<C>__{b.b.}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{and what happens when you stomp on emilio, is you kill him. and you discovered that, didn't you?}
<C>__{b.b.}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{so we drove down to the beach, had a little funeral, and gave emilio a burial at sea. and right now i'm sure he's happy as can be, swimmin around in fish heaven. but the point being, our child learned two very important lessons. one, about life and death. the other, somethings once you do, they can't be undone. i knew just how she felt}
<P>__{(to b.b.)}
<D>__{you loved emilio, didn't you?}
<C>__{b.b.}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{well sweety, i love mommy, but i did to mommy what you did to emilio.}
<C>__{b.b.}
<D>__{you stomped on mommy?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{worse.}
<P>__{(making his finger a gun)}
<D>__{i shot mommy. not pretend shoot, like we were just doing. i shot her for real.}
<C>__{b.b.}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{b.b.}
<D>__{did you want to see what would happen?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{no, i knew what would happen to mommy if i shot her. what i didn't know, is when i shot mommy, what would happen to me.}
<C>__{b.b.}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i was very sad. and that was when i learned, somethings once you do, they can never be undone.}
<C>__{b.b.}
<D>__{what happened to mommy?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{why don't you ask mommy.}
<C>__{b.b.}
<D>__{are you okay mommy. does it hurt?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{no sweety, it doesn't hurt anymore.}
<C>__{b.b.}
<D>__{did it make you sick?}
<C>__{mommy}
<D>__{it put me to sleep. that's why i haven't been with you b.b., i've been asleep.}
<C>__{b.b.}
<D>__{but you're awake now, right?}
<C>__{mommy}
<D>__{i'm wide awake, pretty girl.}
