<A>__{a scene inside the texas school book depository in 1967. jim and lou walk the floor and look out the windows. lou has a mannlicher carcano in his hand with a sight and clip. we see oswald's supposed view of the limousine as he pulls the trigger. now, innocuous traffic goes by, but the iris of the camera tightens into a sniper's scope.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{the zapruder film establishes 3 shots in 5.6 seconds. here. i'm oswald. time me.}
<A>__{lou cocks the mannlicher for the first shot. jim looks at this watch. lou assumes the oswald pose, crouched at the window aiming out.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{go!}
<A>__{lou pulls, quickly recharges the bolt, fires, recycles, fires.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{time?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{between six and seven seconds.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{the key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.}
<P>__{(he recycles the bolt for firing)}
<D>__{the other problem is there was a tree right there...}
<P>__{(he points)}
<D>__{blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the zapruder film.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{didn't hoover say something about that? the leaves had fallen off in november?}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{it was a texas live oak, boss.}
<P>__{(he shakes his head)}
<D>__{it sheds it's leaves the first week of march. you try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13 dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon. no way. the fbi tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match oswald's performance. not one. and oswald was at best a medium shot. the scope was defective on it, too. i mean this is the whole essence of the case to me. the guy couldn't do the shooting. nobody could. and they sold this lemon to the american public.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{the zapruder film is the proof they didn't count on, lou. we gotta get our hands on it.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{that means we gotta subpoena time life on it.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(looks out the window)}
<D>__{why not just shoot kennedy coming up houston? there's plenty of time he's out in the open a frontal shot?}
<A>__{jim points the carcano south, right up houston street, following a car that happens to be passing by a convertible with an unknown woman driving.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{i asked myself the same thing. common sense. even if you miss the first shot, if he accelerates you still got him for a second shot. no... the only reason for waiting to get him on elm is you got him in a triangulated crossfire. you got him on a flat low trajectory from the front at the fence there.}
<A>__{the camera swings to the grassy knoll and the picket fence as seen from the sixth floor of the depository.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{...you put a third team there in that building, on a low floor.}
<A>__{the camera swings to the daltex building across the street.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{when kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(aiming)}
<D>__{how many men?}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{one shooter. one spotter on a radio. maybe three teams. i'd say these were professional riflemen, chief, serious people. hunters... patient. it takes skill to kill with a rifle, that's why there's been no execution of an executive with one in 200 years... "3 2 1... green!"}
<P>__{(he taps jim on the shoulder)}
<D>__{or else "abort! abort!"}
<A>__{jim pulls the dead trigger, reliving the moment through the scope on a passing car.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{main street's over there the original parade route on the way to the trade mart. too far right? impossible shot.}
<A>__{jim swings the scope up to confront main street. another car is in his sight. too far.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{so they changed the route to bring it this way.}
<A>__{moving at a normal 25 mph, they knew the motorcade would have to slow to about 10 miles per hour to make this turn. that's where you get him. the camera swings to the houston and main intersection.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{who do you think changed the parade route?}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{beats me. city officials. secret service. dallas police. they did a dry run with chief curry a few days before. but they didn't bother running through dealey. they stopped right there, said something like, "and afterwards there's only the freeway," and went home.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you know who the mayor was?}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{earle cabell. and guess who his brother is?}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{general charles cabell. deputy director of the cia. fired by kennedy in '61 because of the bay of pigs fiasco, he moved back to the pentagon, called kennedy a "traitor". when he came to new orleans to address the foreign policy association, you know who introduced him? our friend clay shaw.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{the warren commission call him?}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{his boss was the one on the warren commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{allen dulles?}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(he nods)}
<D>__{head of the cia since '53. kennedy fired them both. cabell was his deputy for nine years.}
<P>__{(sickened)}
<D>__{talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop. now we'll have to subpoena them, lou.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{they're gonna love you, chief.}
<A>__{lou walks to another window in the empty book depository where oswald supposedly did his dirty deed and looks out over the plaza, with all its ghosts. jim and lou are two men with only two men's power. a terrible aloneness pervades their minds.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{maybe we should just call it a day, lou. go home. while we're still a little behind. we got two people killed, maybe more we never thought about.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{you never got anyone killed, boss. their actions killed them years before. if we stopped now, it'd be even more wrong.}
<A>__{flashback to 1963 the sixth floor of the texas school book depository the same place jim and lou are now. jim looks around and sees one shooter and one spotter with a lunchbox radio, in repairman clothes. jim is watching. neither of these men is oswald. we hear the sounds of the motorcade below. the shooter pulls the trigger on the carcano. a loud frightening sound snaps jim back to the present.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(in present)}
<D>__{subpoena them, lou dulles, the cabells, time life... the whole damned lot of 'em!}
<A>__{garrison's office 9 months later 1968 we see another smoke filled conference of assistants. paperwork is stacked in the corners almost to the ceiling; there are coffee cups and doughnuts on desks. the disorganization and lack of resources are apparent. the staff working on this project now numbers some eleven people, and there are some new investigators and assistants. we sense that the trial is drawing closer.}
<C>__{al}
<D>__{the u.s. attorney in washington "declines" to serve our subpoena on allen dulles, charles cabell, cia director richard helms, or any fbi agent we named.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.}
<C>__{al}
<D>__{without them, it's going to be near impossible, chief, to prove shaw's connection to the cia. we got the same problem with the governors. all of them. reagan in california won't give us brading, ohio refuses orville townsend, texas on arcacha, and nebraska on sandra moffet.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{what the hell is going on? never before has an extradition request from this office been refused.}
<C>__{al}
<D>__{we haven't tried to get julia anne mercer in?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{no, she could get hurt. if you believe what's happening to these other people.}
<C>__{numa}
<D>__{she's the best damn witness we have!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i just don't want to do it. what else?}
<A>__{numa is opening another stack of letters. the dollar bills keep coming. he points to two giant stacks of mail.}
<C>__{numa}
<D>__{hate mail here. fan mail here. the bad news is the irs has just requested an audit on your income from this office.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(he snorts)}
<D>__{i expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... the bad news is the national guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years.}
<P>__{(we see his hurt)}
<D>__{well, maybe that's good news it was never as good as combat, but this is. bill, any more on oswald and shaw?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{yeah. they were seen together in clinton in early september. the civil rights movement was running a voter registration drive.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{...rumor is shaw, a local boy, was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement. no one really knows what they were doing there, but everyone sure saw 'em. they stood out like cottonballs. i got whites and blacks saw 'em, but last time i checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote. we still got the negro junkie, vernon bundy, saw 'em talkin' at the seawall near lake pontchartrain. but it's tough, boss no one wants to talk about shaw. he's...}
<C>__{lou}
<P>__{(back to present)}
<D>__{you know you keep saying that.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{keep saying what?}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{you're not digging.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i think clinton is a breakthrough. shaw denies he knows ferrie or oswald. is that right? it proves he's a liar. keep on it, bill.}
<P>__{(a look from lou)}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{this is interesting are you ready for this? oswald went to see the fbi two weeks before the assassination. it seems special agent hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on marina oswald.}
<A>__{flashback to dallas fbi office in 1963. oswald is at the counter addressing the female receptionist.}
<C>__{oswald}
<D>__{i want to see special agent hosty.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{i'm sorry, he's not in. can someone else help you?}
<C>__{oswald}
<D>__{can i use a pen?}
<C>__{susie }
<D>__{he left a note. hosty told a dallas newspaperman it was a warning to him to stop questioning marina at their home when oswald was not present. she was not a citizen, so possibly he was threatening to deport her back to russia.}
