<L>__{351 closer angle the group}
<A>__{as zaius draws nearer) lucius lowers his rifle. but taylor keeps his at the ready.}
<C>__{cornelius}
<P>__{(uncertainly)}
<D>__{how did you know we'd come here?}
<C>__{zaius}
<D>__{it wasn't difficult. only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the forbidden zone.}
<P>__{(a glance at taylor)}
<D>__{i see you brought along the female of your species.}
<P>__{(taylor nods)}
<D>__{i didn't realize a man could be monogamous.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{on this planet it's easy.}
<A>__{zaius laughs derisively, then turns to the apes.}
<C>__{zaius}
<P>__{(evenly)}
<D>__{i ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. if you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. but if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.}
<C>__{cornelius}
<P>__{(respectfully)}
<D>__{we've never meant to be treasonable, sir.}
<P>__{(pointing off)}
<D>__{but up there, in the face of that cliff, is a vast cave and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.}
<C>__{zaius}
<D>__{i've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. they're worthless.}
<C>__{taylor}
<P>__{(derisively)}
<D>__{and that's your minister of science. honor bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.}
<C>__{zira}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{taylor, please }
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{except that he's also the chief defender of the faith.}
<C>__{zaius}
<P>__{(loftily)}
<D>__{there is no contradiction between faith and science. true science.}
<C>__{taylor}
<P>__{(suddenly angered)}
<D>__{all right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.}
<C>__{cornelius}
<D>__{taylor, i'd rather you }
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{no. you saved me from this fanatic. maybe i can pay you back.}
<C>__{zaius}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{what is your proposal?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{when were the sacred scrolls written?}
<C>__{zaius}
<D>__{twelve hundred years ago.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{very well. if zira and cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past will you exonerate them?}
<C>__{zaius}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{okay.up to the cave.}
<A>__{he gestures toward the path leading to it. zaius, zira, and cornelius start upward. lucius starts to follow them.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{sorry, lucius. you'll have to stay here and guard the horses.}
<C>__{lucius}
<D>__{always giving orders. just like every other adult.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{relax. you'll see it all later.}
<A>__{he pats the barrel of lucius' gun, in the manner of a stern but benevolent non com, then starts up the trail with nova at his heels. lucius, unused to taking commands from an animal, scowls after him, then shrugs, adjusting to the idea.}
