<L>__{exterior hotel 6 lobby night (carrie's memory hit)}
<A>__{flashing police reds reflect off the glass of the front doors of a hotel. several squad cars are nosed up to the entrance. patrons and bystanders are perched in various locations, watching as a handcuffed carrie is escorted outside by two uniformed officers. her eyes are full of tears. she's put into the backseat of one of the cars. as the door closes, she stares out the window where coroners are loading a body under a sheet into the back of their truck.}
