<A>__{miles is boarding an open boat atop this underground river, the river styx. just beyond a ghoulish human cargo the hooded boatman charon wields a long staff. miles is crossing over to the dark side.}

<A>__{miles returns to earth to find jack and stephanie now in their own little world jack explaining something to stephanie that she finds fascinating, just fascinating. miles converses with maya, but it's clear from her bemused expression that he's being charming if not entirely coherent. another wine reaches the table a comte armand pornrnard. miles looks over at jack and stephanie. they share a short but sensual kiss. moments later miles is on his feet threading his way through the tables. he is very unsteady, and we cut between first and third person perspectives. at the bathrooms he tries the men's room door but it's locked. he pulls the xanax out his pocket and pops one in his mouth, swallowing it dry. he notices a payphone nearby. thinking better of it for a moment, miles makes a drunken bee line for the receiver. close on the keypad as many numbers are dialed, and we hear the tones, completely out of sync, along with a sound melange of interior phone ringing and a pickup. the receiver as miles presses it desperately to his head.}
