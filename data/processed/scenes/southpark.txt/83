<C>__{satan}
<D>__{how come you always want to make love to me from behind? is it because you want to pretend i'm somebody else?}

<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{sometimes i think when i look up real high that there's a whole world up there and just maybe it could be mine but then, i sink because it's here i'm supposed to stay but i don't even know how or why its supposed to be that way }
<A>__{satan walks to his veranda.}
<C>__{satan}
<D>__{up there, there is so much room where babies burp and flowers bloom everyone dreams i can dream too up there, up where the skies are ocean blue i could be safe and live without a care... up there}
<A>__{satan walks over to a bright blue globe and spins it slowly.}
<C>__{satan}
<D>__{they say i don't belong that my place is down below because of my beliefs i'm supposed to stay where evil is sewn but what is evil anyway? is there reason to the rhyme? without evil there could be no good so it must be good to be evil sometimes up there, there is so much room where babies burp and flowers bloom. everyone dreams i can dream too up there, up where the skies are ocean blue i could be safe and life without a care... up there}
<A>__{pull back, big crane shot rising above satan.}
