<A>__{geoff and chase move inside. the offices look like they were built in the 40s. a dark corridor stretches down the center of the suite. faded green walls are solid, with few exteriors. it's creepy in here. heavy, grey plastic curtains absorb much of the light which does find its way in. nothing looks like it's been updated in the past fifty years.}

<D>__{this doesn't look so bad...}
<A>__{chase sweeps a curtain aside, revealing the interior to geoff. dust swirls in the air.}

<D>__{how long ago did this guy retire?}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{it's been a few years.}
<A>__{geoff takes a look around, growing uncomfortable.}

<P>__{(skeptical)}
<D>__{a few?}
<A>__{geoff moves on down the central corridor which seems to grow darker and more dismal with every step. he moves on into the boarding room...}
