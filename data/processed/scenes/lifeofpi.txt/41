<D>__{things changed after the day of appa's lesson. the world had lost some of its enchantment. school was a bore nothing but facts, fractions and french. words and patterns that went on and on. i grew restless, searching for something that would bring meaning into my life. and then i met anandi...}
<A>__{i e. dance studio, pondicherry, 1977 day close on anandi (15) radiant, graceful, eyes aglow, dancing with passionate intensity.}
<C>__{adult pi }
<D>__{mother made me study music, and one day my teacher came down with the flu; he asked if i could take his place one afternoon playing rhythms for a dance class.}
<A>__{pi watches her, hopelessly in love, absent mindedly drumming along. he is drumming for a class of a dozen female students; a dance master (female) accompanies the beat vocally "tumtikita..." etc. the dance master claps her hands, interrupting to teach.}
<C>__{dance master}
<D>__{no. if you do not concentrate, you cannot express your love of god through dance. feel the ground beneath your feet;}
<C>__{dance master }
<D>__{open your gaze out onto the horizon, let that spiritual energy pulse through you and out into the world through abinea. anandi, come to the front; lead them.}
<A>__{anandi obeys; pi watches her, lost in admiration, until the teacher taps a wood block to get his attention. the girls in the class giggle pi blushes, embarrassed. i e. the town market the banyan tree, 1977 day anandi walks with two of her friends through the town market.across the market, pi hides behind a flower seller's stall. gathering his courage, he peers out, searching for anandi. she is nowhere to be seen. he walks into an open area of the market that surrounds a banyan tree. suddenly, he hears a voice behind him.}

<C>__{pi}
<P>__{(after a beat, to cover his evident guilt:)}
<D>__{what does this mean?}
<A>__{pi vaguely imitates the hand gesture pinching the tips of his fingers together that he saw anandi use in the dance rehearsal. anandi stares at him, bewildered.}
<C>__{pi }
<D>__{in the dance, you went from pataka, which means the forest, and then you did then you did samputa, which means something that is hidden, and after that you did this... and then you did chatura.}

<C>__{pi }
<D>__{but at the very end you did this...}
<P>__{(repeating the gesture:)}
<D>__{none of the other dancers did that. what did you mean? the god of love is hiding in the forest?}
<C>__{anandi}
<D>__{no that also means the lotus flower.}
<C>__{pi}
<D>__{the lotus flower is hiding in the forest? why would a lotus flower hide in the forest?}
