<P>__{(picks up robin)}
<D>__{how's my girl! and how's my boy!}
<A>__{they stick a ludicrous printed birthday hat on his head. a bearded santa claus now engulfed with kids, though puffy, body gone, a literal physical wreck, yet a gentle pathos about him and still a charisma that the children react to without thinking. he gives out the presents all over.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(ad libs)}
<D>__{for you... pancho gets this one... melanie yours... hey dorothy don't grab now... open that one, that's yours... keep your paws off that now...}

<A>__{jim cocks his head, listening to it playing from an inner room, his eyes on robin opening the gift a beautiful, antique doll of an 19th century poet rock star, stuffed, velour jacket, white fluffy lace collar, it could be byron or it could be jim morrison in fact the hair is perfectly weaved to resemble jim in his young lion phase an ironic gift, meant from the heart. it stops everybody they all look. a haunted quality to the doll.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{ugh! what's that!}
<C>__{robin}
<P>__{(to jim)}
<D>__{it's you.}
<C>__{jim}
