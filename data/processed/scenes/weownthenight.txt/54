<A>__{a loud, active hallway of a housing project. graffiti on the walls, trash on the floor, but full of life. bobby emerges from the elevator, emotionally distraught. he sees, in one far corner of the hall, two young latino teens smoking crack. he goes to one of the apartment doors, knocks. opening the door is a late middle aged latino woman. behind her, is rosario. (the woman who answers the door is clearly rosario's mother.)}
