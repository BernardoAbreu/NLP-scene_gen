<A>__{malkovich's pov. it's a busy italian restaurant. malkovich looks around, checks his watch: 8:03. a guy walks up to him.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{excuse me, are you john malkovich?}
<C>__{malkovich}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{wow. you were really great in that movie where you played that retard.}
<C>__{malkovich}
<D>__{thank you very much.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i just wanted to tell you that. and say thank you. i have a cousin that's a retard, so, as you can imagine, it means a lot to me to see retards portrayed on the silver screen so compassionately.}
<A>__{the guy walks away. malkovich scans the room. maxine enters the restaurant. we see her, but malkovich doesn't single her out of the crowd. she looks around.}
<C>__{lotte }

<C>__{malkovich}
<D>__{i'm john. i didn't think i was going to come, but i felt oddly compelled. i have to admit i was a bit intrigued by your voice.}
<C>__{lotte }
<D>__{god, she's beautiful. the way she's looking at me. at him. at us.}
<C>__{maxine}
<D>__{and the funny thing is. mr. malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.}
<C>__{lotte }
<D>__{i've never been looked at like this by a woman.}
<C>__{malkovich}
<D>__{can i get you a drink?}
<C>__{maxine}
