<D>__{butt head uuuuuuh, huh huh. uuh,...}
<A>__{out the window, we see two young men carrying b&b's tv into their van. still on the couch, butt head looks over at the broken window. we see a crowbar lying on the floor, and the front door left open. butt head looks at the broken window, at the crowbar, the open door, then back at the empty space where the tv was. he does this a couple of times piecing it all together.}

<A>__{beavis is still in shock. they both stare at the empty space where the tv was for a beat, not quite sure what to do. beavis is shaking and making weird noises. he presses buttons on the remote a few times, as if it might help somehow.}
<D>__{butt head this sucks more than anything that has ever sucked before. we must find this butt hole that took the tv.}
