<A>__{a dozen highway patrol cars now sit in the driveway. the fed in charge, agent hendricks, assigns different officers to secure the area in an incredibly organized fashion. mack, lottie, cleve and arch watch from the porch.}
<L>__{exterior creekside day}
<A>__{butch's eyes are closed. a small puddle of blood drips and becomes a rivulet running down into the creek. phillip, still in the tree, still watching, can't bear it any longer. he slowly climbs down and drops next to butch, who opens his eyes to the boy and smiles.}

<D>__{one thing's for sure now i definitely believe in ghosts.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{never been shot before.}
<C>__{phillip}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{i know ya' are. truth is, if it had to happen, i'm glad it was you. as opposed to someone i don't know, i mean. all things considered, i feel pretty good, though. could use a beer, though.}
<C>__{phillip}
<D>__{what's beer taste like?}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{oh, it's about the best thing there is. you'd better put that on the list.}
<A>__{phillip's eye catches something. he stands up fearfully... his pov two more patrol cars lights spinning, rushing down the road, kicking up dust.}
