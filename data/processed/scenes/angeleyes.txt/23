<L>__{exterior parking lot day}
<A>__{the man runs and sharon chases. robby, not far behind glances off to the side, seeing catch, still following.}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{citizen on your right! hey!}
<A>__{but sharon is now closing on the fleeing man who turns suddenly, pointing a handgun!}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{gun!}
<A>__{and sharon, wide eyed, is already pulling her weapon, but not in time. the man is aiming at her and about to fire when he is tackled by catch. catch and the man go sprawling, and the gun flies out of the man's hand, and sharon is on him in an instant, pointing her gun at him...}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{freeze! right there!}
<A>__{catch scrambles to his feet. robby joins sharon and puts his knee in the man's back and cuffs him, then glances at catch. so does sharon. but catch starts to hurry off.}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{hey! wait!}
<A>__{two other cops (ray juliette and sanchez) rush toward the suspect on the ground.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you got him?}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{he was armed.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{jesus.}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{citizen took him down.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{no shit!?}
<A>__{sharon stares across the lot to where catch has halted. more cops are converging. ray juliette and sanchez move toward catch, while a sergeant and others surround sharon and the suspect. in between the crowd of cops, catch and sharon glance at each other, during...}
<B>__{on catch}
<A>__{as the cops reach him.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{what happened here?}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{i... just saw it and... i saw the gun, so...}
<B>__{on sharon}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{you all right, pogo?}
<A>__{she is shaken, speaks softly.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i was dead. y'know.}
<A>__{she glances toward catch. (she doesn't recognize him from the accident.) their eyes meet briefly, but then their attention is pulled to the others. sharon speaks to her sergeant.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{he had me. i was dead.}
<B>__{on catch}
<A>__{he is shaken, too. sanchez is taking notes as ray checks his i.d.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{i was just walking by. i live near here.}
<A>__{ray nods, handing the i.d. to sanchez.}
<C>__{sanchez}
<D>__{sergeant's going to want to talk to you, mr. lambert. we'll need a statement.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{don't worry about it. that's just procedure. look we appreciate what you did. no bullshit. let us buy you a drink tonight, all right? you know where the rib house is?}
<A>__{catch glances at sharon again, and he nods.}
