<A>__{both hands on the wheel, jenny is burning down the center line. the star man bends two thin wires trailing out from the grip of the drill. jenny winces as he buries them into the flesh on either side of his left wrist. the car skates around the corner of a low hill. they can see that the cobra is still sitting next to the road.}

<D>__{i hope that works.}
<A>__{the star man is lost in concentration. jenny kills her lights and glues the accelerator to the floor. three men scramble from the helicopter with m16s. a burst of slugs rips through the camaro's windshield. the star man leans out the passenger window and with an other worldly scream, fires. the helicopter is blown to smithereens. the concussion throws the men to the ground.}
