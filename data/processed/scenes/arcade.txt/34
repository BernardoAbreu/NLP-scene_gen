<L>__{interior nick's room night}
<A>__{the room is an intricate shrine to nick's obsession...computers and computer generated images. an entire wall is covered with a collage of cut out pictures from magazines. on his shelves are miniature armatures...flexible models of human musculature. and of course, there is nick's computer set up. even as alex climbs down onto nick's bed, she notices that his computer is up and running...connected to the arcade home version.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{nick turns back to the computer monitor.}
<B>__{fractals}
<A>__{(as seen earlier) are blossoming on the screen.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{isn't it amazing? it's a sort of rest position in the game, when you're between levels.}
<A>__{nick pulls alex closer. she's wary. but nick is suitably impressed, excited even.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{they're fractals. visual representations of mathematic equations. the game is totally brilliant. i mean, look at it, it's like a dna molecule or something...}
<A>__{and in truth, the fractals are beautiful. alex turns back to nick. and for the first time, nick stops grinning. it's clear that alex is upset.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{something weird's happening.}
<A>__{nick sits down on his bed.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what do you mean by "weird"?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{greg never came home. a few hours is one thing, nick, but this is different. something's happened to him.}
<A>__{alex glances at the computer monitor again. on the lower right hand side is a little pulsing green light, on and off, on and off, like a heartbeat.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{can you turn off the game?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i'm in the middle of it...}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(upset)}
<D>__{turn if off!}
<A>__{nick is taken aback, but he rises and turns off the computer all the same. and this time, the game stays off. nick comes back to the bed.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{happy?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{look, i know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway...}
<P>__{(carefully)}
<D>__{i think the game's alive somehow.}
<A>__{the look on nick's face says it all. he moves to speak and she stops him.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{no, wait. just listen. i hooked it up earlier tonight, and it said my name. as soon as i turned it on, nick. it said my name. how could it know? and then, i asked it where greg was, and it said, "in here".}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{alex, i think you're freaking out. greg's gone, i will give you that. and maybe he's in trouble. but it's not arcade that's doing it...}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(insistent)}
<D>__{it is.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{how?! it's a machine, alex. machine's don't think. they're not alive. it's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{so how did it know my name, then?}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{you imagined it.}
<A>__{alex is furious. she rises and begins pacing back and forth, voice growing louder. she draws in close.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{see, men always do this. "quiet down, honey. chill out. take a valium". i'm not a fucking idiot, nick!}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{i did not imagine it!!!}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(a strained whisper)}
<D>__{quiet. i do have parents, you know.}
<A>__{alex spins around and points at the computer monitor.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{there!}
<B>__{the monitor}
<A>__{arcade is back on again, fractals unfolding and green monitor light blinking.}
<B>__{on nick}
<A>__{okay. alright. this does throw him for a second.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{it turned itself back on, nick.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{no it didn't. it's just a faulty relay or something. it happens.}
<A>__{nick crosses to the monitor and flips the "off" switch. he tries it again and again, but the game won't turn off.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{it's alive, nick. it's listening to us ...}
<A>__{nick spins around, angry, maybe a little freaked out.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{just shut up! enough already, okay?}
<A>__{silence for a moment. nick takes a deep breath. over reacted. after a moment...}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{sorry. maybe i need the valium.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{call the others. laurie, benz...}
<A>__{nick acquiesces. he pulls out his phone and punches in a number.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i will try stilts. he's got insomnia.}
<A>__{nick and alex watch each other in silence as the connection is made. we can faintly hear the phone ringing. no answer.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{okay...laurie, then.}
<A>__{alex turns away, sinking to nick's bed. all the anger has drained out of her. she knows they won't reach them.}
<B>__{on nick}
<A>__{as he listens for an answer. three rings, four, five... he hangs up. punches in the final number.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{benz...}
<A>__{again. no answer. nick hangs up and sets the phone aside. he looks at alex.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(fatalistic)}
<D>__{something's happened to them.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{it's the middle of the night. they're asleep. phone didn't wake them.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{all of them?}
<A>__{nick shrugs. he's not willing to accept anything, but he's uncomfortable all the same.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{look, why are you fucking with me like this?}
<A>__{alex rises. she's tired. tired and scared.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{because i didn't know where else to go.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(glances at a clock)}
<D>__{it's two o'clock in the morning. go home. go to sleep. we'll figure something out in the morning.}
<A>__{and then, more for himself than for her.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{it's not this weird. it'll make sense. everything gets weird this late anyway, right?}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(half hearted)}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{she turns and climbs back out the window onto the roof. then she ducks her head back in.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{if i were you, i'd think twice about playing that game again.}
<A>__{then she's gone. nick moves over and watches. nick's p.o.v. as alex drops down from the roof and makes her way to greg's car. the streetlight outside is still flickering. nick turns back to his room. moves back to the monitor and watches the fractals unfolding. he gives the "off" switch a token try. nothing.}
<B>__{the fractals}
<A>__{we move in on them, losing ourselves in the labyrinth of swirling colors and we...}
