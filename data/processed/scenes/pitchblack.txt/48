<L>__{exterior crash ship day}
<A>__{paris has taken over as look out atop the ship. he deals with the heat by erecting a "misting" umbrella: he fills a reservoir with liquor, dials up a regulator. umbrella spars shoot bursts of cooling alcohol vapor. paris luxuriates in it.}
<C>__{zeke }
<D>__{comfy up there?}
<A>__{zeke appears below. he loads a scrap metal sled with tarp, cable, pick ax.}
<C>__{paris}
<D>__{amazing how you can do without the essentials of life so long as you have the luxuries.}
<C>__{zeke}
<D>__{well, just keep your bloody fuckin' eyes open. don't want that ratbag sneakin' up on me bloody fuckin' arse.}
<A>__{he drags the sled toward the spired hills. keeping one eye on zeke, paris eases into a chair, lays the war pick across his lap, pours himself a spot of sherry. as he sips, a blade touches his throat .}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{he'd probably get you right here, right under the jaw. and you'd never hear him coming. that's how good riddick is.}
<A>__{paris eases the hunting boomerang away.}
<C>__{paris}
<D>__{now did you run away from your parents? or did they run away from you?}
