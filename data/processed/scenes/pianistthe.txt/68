<L>__{exterior ghetto street day}
<A>__{in bright sun, szpilman and benek march in a column, four abreast, under the command of two jewish foremen, guarded by two german policemen. they are being marched out of the ghetto gates.}
<C>__{szpilman}
<P>__{(to benek)}
<D>__{my god. i haven't been outside for it must be two years.}
<C>__{fellow worker}
<P>__{(on the other side of him)}
<D>__{don't get over excited.}
<L>__{exterior zelazna brama square day}
<A>__{street traders with baskets full of wares, fruit, vegetables, fish, tins of preserves. women bargain with them, making purchases. lively, colourful. dealers in gold and currency calling monotonously.}
<C>__{dealers}
<D>__{gold, buy gold! dollars! roubles!}
<A>__{later: szpilman, on top of a free standing scaffold, benek and the others demolishing a ghetto wall, wielding skdgehammers. they work slowly. a smartly dressed young couple are passing, but stop. they stare. the young woman is extremely attractive and knows it. the foremen, workers and the german policemen ogle her.}
<C>__{the young woman}
<D>__{look oh, do look!}
<A>__{her young man is puzzled; she points.}
<C>__{the young woman}
<D>__{jews!}
<C>__{the young man}
<D>__{can't be the first time you've ever seen jews.}
<A>__{embarrassed, she giggles and they go. szpilman, benek and the others continue to work. the foremen sit, sunning themselves, and the german policemen stand, deep in conversation, ignoring the workers. szpilman suddenly stops work. he has seen something in the square that alerts him. at the furthest stall, he sees a woman, attractive, chic, in her thirties, buying vegetables at a stall. her name is janina godlewska. surreptitiously, szpilman raises a hand, trying to catch her attention. but he's frightened of alerting the german policemen and the foremen. benek has noticed.}
<C>__{benek}
<D>__{someone you know?}
<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{again szpilman tries, but janina, her profile to him, doesn't see.}
<C>__{benek}
<D>__{a beauty. who is she?}
<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{a singer. her husband's an actor. i knew them well. good people. i'd like to talk to her.}
<C>__{benek}
<P>__{(playful)}
<D>__{don't forget, mr. wladek, they hang them for helping jews.}
<A>__{he goes back to work. the german policemen wander over to one of the stalls to buy fruit. the moment they do so two jewish workers scamper across to another stall to buy bread. szpilman glances across the square: janina is still at the stall. he comes to a decision. he jumps down, is about to dash towards janina, but stops dead. janina is no longer there.}
