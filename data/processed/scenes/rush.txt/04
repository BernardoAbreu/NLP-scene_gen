<L>__{exterior starting grid day}
<A>__{we widen to find ourselves on the starting grid of a major grand prix. all around us... engines scream into life as drivers start their cars. an official walks through the cars holding aloft a sign, "one minute"... deafening, angry thunder as engines rev impatiently.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{this is bullshit. we have no control over our legacy. we cannot choose what we are remembered for...}
<A>__{a ferrari mechanic rushes towards niki, and shouts in italian above the noise, (we see sub titles)...}
<C>__{mechanic}
<D>__{mass usa slicks. le vuoi cambiare anche tu?}
<P>__{(mass is going on slicks. you want to change?)}
<A>__{niki looks in his wing mirror back to see a red mclaren, white helmet, number 12, several rows behind him. a team of mechanics hastily changing the tyres to dry tyres.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{otherwise i wouldn't be remembered for my rivalry with this asshole. and the 1976 season.}
<A>__{niki then looks over at the car in pole position beside him. another mclaren, but with number 11, and a union jack...}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{what about hunt? has he changed?}
<C>__{mechanic}
<D>__{no, he's going on wets.}
<A>__{the car in pole position: james hunt, surrounded by tv crews, mechanics, girlfriends, hangers on.. the maclaren team is less than half the size of ferrari's, but hunt makes up for this with magnetism. the rock star of f1. niki's face: a stab of envy seeing a flash of his rival's glamorous long blonde hair disappearing into his balaclava, flirting with several hot looking girls..}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{i don't know why it became such a big thing. we were just drivers. busting each other's balls. to me this is perfectly normal. but other people saw it differently.}
<C>__{niki }
<D>__{that whatever it was between us went deeper. and changed us both somehow. forever.}
<A>__{niki stares, then...}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{be, allora usiamo anche noi quells da bagnato.}
<P>__{(then we go on wets, too.)}
<A>__{the ten second board is held up. niki pulls down his visor...as he and hunt's eyes meet for a split second, eyes staring... niki selects second gear for the wet track and revs the engine. the dashboard needle climbs through 8000, 9000, 10000}
<B>__{rpm.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{maybe that explains the state of mind i was in. and why it happened. the other thing i'm remembered for.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{on august 1st, that same year...}
<A>__{caption: "august 1st, 1976". the starter waves the flag. niki's foot hits the floor his engine screams that deafening, stomach rearranging high pitch scream, drowning out the roar of the 180,000 crowd. niki's car is catapaulted forward violently, the wheel spin leaving livid black scars on the asphalt.. niki gets away first. a good start! but within seconds there's a mclaren car right behind him, breathing down his neck. his arch rival. hunt. but as the mclaren roars past, niki sees a white helmet. number 12. it's not hunt. it's mass. on his bald, slick tyres. niki curses under his breath. he screwed up. made the wrong decision. should have gone on slicks. he urgently needs to change tyres... niki swerves angrily into the pits. ferrari's pit is right at one end...}
