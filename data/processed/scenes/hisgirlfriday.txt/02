<D>__{done what?}
<C>__{burns}

<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{holy mackerel! look, walter, that's what divorces are for.}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{nonsense. you've got the old fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever till 'death us do part'. why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. it's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. we've got something between us nothing can change.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{i suppose that's true in a way. i am fond of you, walter. i often wish you weren't such a stinker.}
<C>__{burns}

<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?}

<C>__{walter}
<D>__{what home? don't you remember the home i promised you?}
<C>__{hildy}

<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{all i know is that instead of two weeks in atlantic city with my bridegroom, i spent two weeks in a coal mine with john kruptzky age sixty three getting food and air out of a tube! you don't deny that. do you?}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{deny it! i'm proud of it! we beat the whole country on that story.}
<C>__{hildy}
<D>__{well, suppose we did? that isn't what i got married for. what's the good of look, walter, i came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day sending twenty telegrams all the rest of it, because i'm }

<D>__{what?!!}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{i haven't any hard feelings.}
<C>__{hildy}

<C>__{burns}

<D>__{listen, walter }
<C>__{burns}
<P>__{(going right on)}
<D>__{i made a great reporter out of you, hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. you need me and i need you and the paper needs both of us.}
