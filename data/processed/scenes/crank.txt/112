<L>__{int eve’s apartment, 4 minutes later}
<A>__{eve’s pad is nothing like chev’s. it’s all cats and incense, warm natural light, a scratchy van morrison lp playing on a real record player. eve, in a cotton nightgown, is in the kitchen, attempting some bit of microwave programming, punching random buttons and getting herself worked up.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(to the microwave)}
<D>__{i hate you ...}
<A>__{five bangs on the door barely distract her.}
<P>__{eve (cont’d)}
<D>__{just a minute.}
<A>__{more bangs, insistent.}
<P>__{eve (cont’d)}
<D>__{alright, alright, jesus ...}
<A>__{she gives up on the microwave, goes to answer the door.}
<P>__{eve (cont’d)}
<D>__{... calm down, what the hell ...}
<A>__{it’s chev. he’s dressed in a blue adidas jogging suit long sleeve jacket, warm up pants with buttons down the side, the works. he couldn’t look more out of place in eve’s mellow apartment. he’s bathed in sweat, wild eyed, hair slicked back like gordon gekko.}
<P>__{eve (cont’d)}
<D>__{oh. my. god.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{hey doll.}
<A>__{he pulls her toward him and kisses her. she accepts the kiss gratefully enough with her mouth, but holds both hands out to her sides as if touching the jogging suit would kill her. without making eye contact, he breaks away and pushes into the apartment, looking around everywhere, paranoid.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{is this your new look or something?}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{that’s right. you into it?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{it’s ... completely appalling. very you, chev.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{he checks into the bedroom, satisfies himself that it’s empty.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{are you looking for my other boyfriend?}
<C>__{chev}
<P>__{(ignoring this)}
<D>__{you haven’t turned on the tv today, right?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{no. why?}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{didn’t think so. listen, we’ve got to get out of here.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{what are you talking about? don’t be such a freak.}
<A>__{chev goes to the window, peaks through the curtains.}
<P>__{eve (cont’d)}
<D>__{actually, i’m glad you’re here. can you change the clock on the microwave?}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i never changed it back.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{the microwave.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{yeah. i never changed it back. you know, daylight savings time.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{i bought you some flowers, but they got fucked up on the way over here.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{that’s sweet. are you ok? you look like you’re on drugs or something.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{you love me, right?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{then i need you to do something for me.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{what is it? what’s wrong?}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{i need you to put some clothes on and come with me right now.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{but ... i ...}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{i’ll change the clock on the microwave.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{confused, she pads off to the bedroom to change. chev goes into the kitchen. he peeks out the kitchen window, looks around nervously, glances at the microwave, walks up and punches two buttons.}
