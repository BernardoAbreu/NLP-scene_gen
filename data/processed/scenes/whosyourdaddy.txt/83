<A>__{principal merkin supervises a crew of kindergarten children, cleaning up the roadside litter. julie and ted watch from...}

<D>__{see what i mean. he's squeaky clean. he makes gandhi look like a war monger.}
<A>__{ted steels himself. somehow, they'll get him.}
<L>__{exterior xenia water tower day}
<A>__{in the golden light of sunset, molly, a stunning "xenia girl," stands on the stairs that curve up around a huge water tower that overlooks the city. her loose spring dress billows in the wind. held on by only one button. exposing in quick glimpses that she isn't wearing a bra. an assistant holds a portable strobe, attached to a reflector. charlie shoots with his nikon. motor drive whirling.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i have a great idea. let's lose the last button.}
<A>__{molly grins. then unbuttons. we hear a round of "oohs" from below. ted glances down, where... hundreds of binoculars, cameras, and camcorders are poised on the scene. men of all ages are milling around, gawking, focusing their long lenses. women are conspicuously absent. except for the gaggle of hardcore feminists with their placards, denouncing "heaven." one feminist approaches the mayor.}
<C>__{feminist}
<D>__{the city tower belongs to the city, not to some pornographer.}
<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{the library also belongs to the city. and guess what? it's going to have a new ted nelson wing with three thousand children's books.}
<A>__{the feminist tries to respond, but a helicopter swoops overhead, drowning out her words. the helicopter rises to the level of the photo shoot where the door slides open. and just when we think it must have been hired by some hard core fans who wanted a closer look, we find principal merkin frowning as he barks through a bullhorn.}
<C>__{principal merkin}
<D>__{you should be ashamed, young lady! your body is a sacred temple!}
<A>__{molly flashes him. principal merkin averts his eyes. missing the sight of molly's dress being blown off her body by the chopper's prop wash. the spectators below applaud. they watch in amazement as her dress floats down to them.}
<C>__{principal merkin }
<D>__{young lady, i will pray for god's mercy upon your soul.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{don't bother, merk! i'm already going to "heaven!"}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(to charlie)}
<D>__{get them together.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(eyes lighting up)}
<D>__{brilliant! molly, give me all you've got. for merk.}
<A>__{molly gets the idea. she poses provocatively towards principal merkin, who suddenly realizes he's in a compromising position.}
<C>__{principal merkin}
<D>__{stop that, stop that this instant!}
<A>__{but molly pulls off her panties and flings them at him.}
