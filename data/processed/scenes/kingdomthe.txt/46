<A>__{frenetic doorman valet ballet. 2 black suburbans with red blue diplomatic plates swing onto the round about. a bald, waif like 38 year old saudi man gets out of the lead vehicle. fleury waiting outside, eyes on his watch. to thamer:}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{get back in.}
<L>__{interior diplomatic suburban moments later}
<A>__{a big bodyguard sits up front. fleury sits in back, aims the ac vents his way. prince thamer sits next to him. bright lights from the trail suburban illuminate the interior. prince thamer looks more than a bit baffled.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{too many people we both know were at the bar. it's a pleasure to meet you, your highness.}
<C>__{prince thamer}
<D>__{i had an interesting conversation with a reporter from the post.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{she can be a bit of an exaggerator... i'm sure things were somewhat over stated. i see myself as friend of saudi arabia. i just need a little cooperation, that's all.}
<C>__{prince thamer}
<D>__{what kind of cooperation??}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{full cooperation: my team cleared to land at prince sultan air base. tomorrow. we want to help in a very muscular way, quickly.}
<C>__{prince thamer}
<D>__{next month would be as soon as...}
<A>__{fleury takes a beat.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{this goes one of two ways. first: the fbi with the white house go on the kind of aggressive pr "saudi royal family decaying monarchy" bender that just can't help but hurt. really hurt. and i don't care how many chinese are lined up to buy the oil. you know it's gonna hurt.}
<C>__{prince thamer}
<D>__{my family is not decaying }
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{and then we bring the hammer down hard as hell: bust al haramain we got direct links from riyadh two wives donating ten million to three arab american cultural centers in boston. then what gets kind of not funny is how some of that cash found its way to jakarta and some mosques that have these training camps built right next to them. it's kinda funny... you got little kids playing over here, and some not so little kids playing with guns over here. that's kinda odd.}
<C>__{prince thamer}
<D>__{you have no proof of this.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{we're getting there, sir. and i haven't even brought up the two girls still missing out of houston. this is big. it is real. and i know you only care so much about public american opinion, sir. but the story will be covered... big...}
<A>__{thamer is clearly rattled. fleury is starting to crack this man.}
<C>__{ronald fleury }
<D>__{and this ain't the metro section. it's above the fold, just below the date. words like these get syndicated to papers like the omaha world herald, the terrell tribune you ever been to terrell, texas?}
<C>__{prince thamer}
<D>__{what is your point?}
<A>__{fleury looks back to him.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{last i heard, 112 people lost their lives in your country. one of them was a good friend of mine. i want in and i want in immediately.}
<A>__{that's a rock solid answer.}
<C>__{prince thamer}
<D>__{define "immediately."}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{right now immediately.}
<A>__{fleury looks back at the ambassador. a stare down.}
<C>__{fleury}
<D>__{if your phone doesn't work international, you can borrow mine.}
<A>__{prince thamer slowly reaches for his phone as fleury opens his door.}
<C>__{fleury }
<D>__{i will just be right out here.}
