<L>__{interior pete's office day}
<A>__{miranda. numb. pete trying hard to get through. a beat. we get a good look at the writing on her arm. (the right arm.)}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i can't help you if you don't talk to me.}
<A>__{silence from miranda. he is firm but not unkind:}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i can stand here all day. all week. you're the one running out of time.}
<A>__{nothing. he goes to touch her arm. she jerks it away.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{what does it mean?}
<A>__{she shakes her head, at a loss. torn between her suspicion and the need to confide in someone. finally:}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i didn't write this.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{then who?}
<A>__{they stare each other down. there's definitely chemistry between these two. but the moment is far from romantic.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{you're going to have to trust me.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{because no matter what's going through your mind right now, i haven't done anything wrong.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{then you know exactly how i feel.}
<A>__{he starts to speak, stops himself. switches tactics. their banter escalates in speed as their terms get more clinical:}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{you admit you're having a hard time differentiating what's reality from what's hallucination, right? so isn't it at least possible that }
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{as a doctor i agree with you. maybe and this is a big maybe all of this is just a deep epilepsy that extends to the limbic structures, but i'm telling you }
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{how about this moment right now?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{what about it?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{is this a hallucination?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{you tell me. but i do know what i sound like. paranoia is the ultimate awareness, right?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{which is why i suggest we simply increase your dose until }
<C>__{miranda}
<P>__{(venom)}
<D>__{no! goddamnit! no!}
<A>__{he steps back at her blowout. she catches the look on his face and forces herself to sit down.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i'm sorry. is there any way we can pretend that didn't just happen?}
<C>__{miranda }
<P>__{(beat; struggling)}
<D>__{i want to believe you. i do. so i will take your word for it you're not involved in this but you take mine: i didn't write this and i didn't kill my husband.}
<A>__{he studies her. finally nods. new tactic:}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{alright. let's say you didn't write this }
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{number one: i'm right handed. number two: i would have had to bring an x acto knife into the shower to do this, wouldn't i?}
<A>__{pete tries to reserve judgment. her argument has a certain loopy logic to it. he hesitates, then pulls a series of photographs from a manila envelope.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i think it's time you look at these.}
<A>__{miranda looks at the crime scene photos. lurid. terrible. here's part of doug's body. here's the axe. and now she sees a closeup picture of the wall with words on it. in blood, a la manson family. and it says: "not alone." miranda immediately tosses it away from her. repulsed }
