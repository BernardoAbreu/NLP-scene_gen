<A>__{soran is working intently on the launcher's control panel. picard is still walking the perimeter of the forcefield. he's also still trying to engage soran, find some way to get to him.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{what you're about to do is no different from when the borg destroyed your world.}
<A>__{soran continues to work... keeps his voice calm and conversational.}
<C>__{soran}
<D>__{you're right. and there was a time when i wouldn't have hurt anyone. then the borg came... and they showed me that if there is one constant in this universe, it's death.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{afterwards, i began to realize that none of it mattered. we're all going to die anyway. it's only a question of how and when. you will too, captain. you might contract a fatal disease... you might die in battle...}
<A>__{soran now turns and fixes picard with a penetrating look.}
<C>__{soran}
<D>__{... or burn to death in a fire.}
<A>__{picard freezes at this. soran steps off the launcher with a confident look... he moves closer to where picard is standing.}
<C>__{soran}
<D>__{you looked surprised. but you shouldn't be. i've been to the nexus, captain. i know things about people.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{aren't you beginning to feel time gaining on you? it's like a predator. it's stalking you. you can try to outrun it with doctors... medicines.new technologies... but in the end, time is going to hunt you down... and make the kill.}
<A>__{this strikes home with picard's own recent concerns... he struggles for a moment.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{we're all. mortal, soran. it's one of the truths of our existence.}
<C>__{soran}
<D>__{what if i told you i found a new truth...}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{the nexus.}
<C>__{soran}
<D>__{time has no meaning there. the predator has no teeth.}
<A>__{soran glances up at the sky expectantly, then turns away from picard and goes back to work on the launcher. off picard's disturbed expression...}
