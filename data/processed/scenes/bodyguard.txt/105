<L>__{exterior pool area day}
<A>__{this place is crowded with hundreds of guests basking on chaise lounges. a sea of sun baked faces virtually as far as the eye can see. the sight of the crowd and the presence of the news crew seems to push rachel to a whole new adrenaline level. rachel walks among them, moving swiftly, evaluating the bodies displayed before her in words and expressions, playing to the camera.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{oh my god. look what they're wearing. mother, hide your eyes...}
<A>__{heads turn to look.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i couldn't wear that suit... honey, you're naked... of course, if i had a body like that...}
<A>__{there is a murmur of recognition from some of the guests. she pauses to shake a hand, and now all the guests throughout the pool area are aware that rachel marron is among them. people stand on chairs, scramble for pens and paper, run to get a closer look. lounges collapse, drink glasses are broken, flower tubs are trampled. a lot of pushing and shoving starts too much for the video crew, who abandon the filming attempt.}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{great, babe. they got what they needed. let's get back inside.}
<A>__{frank increases his pace to keep by rachel's side, gently easing a path for her. schiller scurries behind in frank's wake. rachel turns suddenly as a tall good looking lifeguard appears in the throng. she eyes him appreciatively.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(to lifeguard)}
<D>__{you look like a man of good taste to me. come to my party tonight.}
<P>__{(to schiller)}
<D>__{ben, make sure this boy gets to my party.}
<A>__{schiller nods. rachel glances at frank, making sure he gets the point, and then she's off again. the throng gets tighter. frank's having to work harder, steering her towards the door back into the hotel. the familiar chant starts up: "rachel, rachel." it's starting to resemble the frenzy of the opening scene. this time, amid the thrusting hands and clamoring faces, a few bewildered elderly guests look dazed as they are shoved forward. a child starts crying, lost in the mess of legs and bermuda shorts. a distraught mother tries to reach him. someone is jostled into the pool as the crowd surges again. amid the chaos, whistles and scattered applause. rachel drinks it all in.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(over her shoulder)}
<D>__{thank you. thank you. come tonight and give till it hurts.}
<A>__{with a final surge, frank makes it to the door with his party. the door closes shut behind them. a mass of distorted faces pushes onto the glass. the party walks on briskly.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(to spector)}
<D>__{i'm beginning to wonder about your judgement, sy. why do i have to keep paying my dues if i've already arrived?}
<C>__{spector}
<P>__{(very fast)}
<D>__{kick me, beat me... whatever makes you feel good. but let's not pretend you don't like it. we're too close for that. whipping people into a frenzy is why you got into it in the first place.}
<A>__{rachel's eyes lock with spector's there's a real connec tion and understanding here that she spends a lot of time denying. frank sees it as clearly as spector, whose tone becomes almost soothing }
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{and it's nothing to be ashamed of, either, not for a second. it's a gift... and only a handful are given it. many call but few are answered.}
<C>__{spector }
<D>__{don't fool with the blessing, rachel. the magic is sustained through its use.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{now you're going to tell me about magic? give it a rest will ya...}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{i'm done. not another word...}
<P>__{(a crooked smile)}
<D>__{... i know you like to be reminded sometimes.}
<A>__{rachel looks away. it's true. he's good at his job.}
