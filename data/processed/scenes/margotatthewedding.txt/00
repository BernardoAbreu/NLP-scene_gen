<L>__{interior train car day}
<A>__{a cashier hands a boy, 13, his change across a counter. the boy stuffs the coins in his pocket. he lifts the cardboard tray with two hot dogs, a bag of chips, and two cokes. this is claude. we follow him: he carefully carries the meal down the aisle, balances it in one hand as he opens the door. the train noise blares as he traverses the area between cars. he enters the new car repeating the balancing act. he waits while a man shoves his back pack onto the metal rack above the seats. claude hurries a bit more now, his concentration alternating between the food and the path. he sits next to a brunette woman. he hands her a hot dog.}

<A>__{he gets up and hurries a few seats further. he slides next to a pretty brunette woman, late 30's, with straight shoulder length hair. her name is margot.}
