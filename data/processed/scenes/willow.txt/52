<L>__{interior tavern hallway day}
<A>__{madmartigan is slammed against a wall. the willow. then llug and his wife. in the b.g. nockmaar troops are rousting the tavern, taking babies away from frightened mothers and inspecting them. heavy bootsteps thud toward them. willow looks out and recognizes sorsha, the black helmeted knight from the bridge.}
<C>__{sorsha}
<D>__{you! are you the mother of that child?}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(looks at llug; in a high voice)}
<D>__{i mean yes.}
<A>__{sorsha strides over to madmartigan, her sword drawn.}
<C>__{sorsha}
<D>__{let me see it.}
<A>__{madmartigan looks at willow then back at sorsha.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<P>__{(high voice)}
<D>__{i can't.}
<C>__{sorsha}
<D>__{let me see it.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{no! you can't!}
<A>__{madmartigan looks at willow then back at sorsha.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<P>__{(high voice)}
<D>__{i can't.}
<C>__{sorsha}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<P>__{(to willow)}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{because she's sick.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<P>__{(to sorsha)}
<D>__{because she's sick.}
<C>__{sorsha}
<D>__{give it to me!}
<A>__{sorsha stabs her sword into the floor like a spike. she grabs for the baby. instinctively, madmartigan el bows her away, whacking her hard and knocking her off balance against a nearby bench. the soldiers tense up, pointing their swords and spears. sorsha regains her balance. she rips off her black helmet. long wild red hair tumbles over her shoulders. she is a young woman, and madmartigan's eyes pop open. he does his best to keep up his femal facade.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<P>__{(high voice)}
<D>__{gawd...you're...beautiful...}
<C>__{sorsha}
<D>__{you're not a woman.}
<A>__{sorsha comes right up to madmartigan, squinting into his eyes. the she rips away his kerchief and muffler.}
<C>__{llug}
<D>__{not a woman??!!}
<A>__{all hell breaks loose. llug charges for madmartigan's throat. madmartigna tucks the baby under his arm and dashes right out the window. llug bulldozes sorsha and her lieutenant, and the tavern patrons take advantage of the chaos and stampede for the stairs. willow dives out the window after madmartigan.}
<C>__{sorsha}
<D>__{after them!!}
<A>__{she grabs her sword and waves it at her soldiers who clatter toward the stairs, flinging people out of their way.}
