<L>__{interior kitchen. evening}
<D>__{jenny's mother and father are doing the washing up and listening to the radio. they have their backs to the door. jenny enters the room quietly and watches them for a moment}
<C>__{man on the radio}
<D>__{they do need some looking after, but nothing that will require too much work. just leave them in your potting shed for a couple of weeks, and they'll look after themselves.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh, aye. the potting shed. who does he think i am? prince rainier of monaco?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{what if i got married instead of going to college? jack and marjorie turn around and stare at this strange apparition wearing too much make up and a school uniform.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{married?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{married.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it would depend who it was, surely?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{would it? that's interesting.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{course it would. i wouldn't want you married off just for the sake of it.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{has somebody asked you?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{who?}
<A>__{marjorie rolls her eyes.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{what did you tell him?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{nothing yet.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{david?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{no. a man i just met walking his dog.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{david's asked you to marry him? bloody hell. pardon my french.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{do you have any choice? or is it too late.}
<A>__{she looks at her daughter knowingly. jack merely looks confused.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{of course she's got a choice. but it's an interesting one, isn't it?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{this is where you're supposed to say, "but what about oxford?"}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well. looked at it one way, you wouldn't really need to go now, would you? he's a man going places. and say what you like, but they know how to take care of their money, don't they? he'll see you're looked after.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(quietly, turning the}
<D>__{words over in her}
<P>__{mouth)}
<D>__{i wouldn't need to go. would you like to expand on that?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you know what i mean.}
<A>__{jenny laughs bitterly. she can't believe it.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{all that latin! all those essays! what was the point? why didn't you just send me out prowling round nightclubs? it would have been less trouble. and i might have had more fun.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{we don't know about nightclubs. we knew about education. anyway, it all turned out for the best.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{he wouldn't have wanted you if you were thick, would he?}
<A>__{jenny stares at them and walks out.}
