<L>__{int swiss guard headquarters day}
<A>__{the headquarters of the swiss guard is in a lushly adorned renaissance library crammed with sophisticated communications and surveillance equipment. it's crowded, swiss guard (in suits and ties, the pantaloons are more for show), uniformed carbinieri, and vatican police crammed around different stations, some working together, others arguing, mostly in italian.}
<C>__{olivetti}
<D>__{wait here.}
<A>__{he crosses the room to a tall, fair haired man around sixty, weathered like steel maybe "tempered" is the better word. while they confer, langdon notices a woman to his left. we recognize vittoria vetra, the physicist we saw at cern. she catches langdon's eye, forces a grim smile, recognizes they're both strangers here. olivetti comes back with commander rocher, the tall man, very much in charge. he speaks with a french swiss}
<B>__{accent}
<C>__{rocher}
<P>__{(to vittoria)}
<D>__{ms. vetra? i'm commander rocher, commandante principale of the swiss guard. thank you for coming. and professor langdon?}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{that's right. rocher looks him up and down, so, you're langdon.}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{thank god, the symbologist is here. ms. vetra, this way, please.}
<A>__{he leads vittoria across the room, to a surveillance monitor. langdon, puzzled by the cold shoulder, looks at olivetti, who leans in.}
<C>__{olivetti}
<D>__{there's been a development. we received another threat from the kidnapper.}
<A>__{across the room, they hear vittoria gasp. olivetti goes to join them, nodding to langdon to follow. at the monitor, langdon and olivetti join rocher and vittoria and stare at the image on a video monitor it's a familiar looking canister, in which a metallic drop of liquid shimmers in the middle, suspended. the acronym cern is stenciled up its side. on its base is an led display, counting down from about six hours. at the top of the monitor flashes superimposed text live feed, camera #86.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{ canister was stolen from our lab around midnight last night. the intruder killed my research partner, leonardo bentivoglio, and mutilated him in order to bypass security.}
<A>__{they look at her, don't quite see the connection.}
<C>__{vittoria }
<D>__{we use retinal scanners.}
<P>__{(they still don't get it)}
<D>__{they cut out his eyes.}
<A>__{they cringe.}
<C>__{vittoria }
<D>__{that canister contains an extremely combustible substance called antimatter. we need to locate it immediately or evacuate vatican city.}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{i'm quite familiar with incendiaries, ms. vetra. i haven't heard of antimatter.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{it's new, energy research technology. it uses a reverse polarity vacuum to filter out anti matter positrons generated in particle accelerations in the large hadron collider at cern.}
<A>__{they look at her blankly. she points at the screen,}
<C>__{vittoria }
<D>__{the anti matter is suspended, there, in an airtight nanocomposite shell with electromagnets at each end. but if it were to fall out of suspension and come into contact with matter say, the bottom of the canister the two opposing forces will annihilate one another. violently.}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{and what might cause it to fall out of suspension?}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{the battery going dead. which it will.}
<P>__{(looks at the screen)}
<D>__{in six hours and eleven minutes.}
<A>__{silence for a moment.}
<C>__{vittoria }
<D>__{where is that camera? number eighty six?}
<C>__{olivetti}
<D>__{it's wireless. it too was stolen. that could be anywhere inside the vatican walls.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{you've got to find it.}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{we're a bit preoccupied with four missing cardinals at the moment.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{you don't understand. an annihilation is a cataclysmic event. it would be a blinding explosion, equivalent to about five megatons. the blast radius alone would be }
<A>__{softly, langdon speaks up from behind her.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{"vatican city will be consumed by light."}
<A>__{a few voices fall still. they turn and look at him.}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{those are the exact words the kidnapper used.}
