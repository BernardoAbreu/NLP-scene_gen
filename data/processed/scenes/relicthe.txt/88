<L>__{interior entrance to superstition exhibit rotunda night}
<A>__{the crowd is now packed into the rotunda as the mayor cuts a red ribbon across the entrance to the exhibit and everyone applauds. cuthbert is by the mayor's side. he steps forward and raises his hand for quiet. the crowd falls silent.}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{thank you everyone and welcome. we're glad all of you were willing to brave the inclement weather to be with us tonight. our special thanks to his honor, the mayor and his lovely wife.}
<A>__{the mayor takes a bow. more applause.}
<C>__{cuthbert }
<D>__{some people have questioned whether a superstition exhibit belongs in a museum of science. spells, incantations, demons, magic... these are forces that defy the natural laws. superstition provides answers to the great questions based on fear. science provides answers to the great questions based on truth. science and superstition, then, are polar opposites. mortal enemies, if you will. and that is why we are here tonight. we have come to learn more about the enemy, and thus to bring about its defeat. for every good, there is an evil, for every dark, a light. and so tonight... my friends, i give you ignorance, terror, unreasoning fear, pure evil.}
