<L>__{interior needy's room evening}
<A>__{needy is sitting at her lamp lit desk, reading an old e.c. horror comic and eating a banana. the phone rings. needy picks it up.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{needy speaking.}
<T>__{cross cut: phone call:}
<L>__{interior jennifer's bedroom continuous}
<A>__{jennifer's hair is still wet from the lake, but she's changed into shorts and a tank top. music blasts from her stereo. she admires herself in the mirror, popping her ass.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i feel sooo scrumptious!}
<A>__{she picks up a soft shoulder button and pokes her arm hard with the pin without flinching. blood spurts from the wound.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{good for you.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{you know, like when you kiss a hot guy for the first time and your whole body feels like it's on vibrate.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{it's that good.}
<A>__{jennifer gazes at her arm, transfixed. she wipes the blood away the wound has magically disappeared.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{lucky you. see, i'm still kind of depressed about, you know, the giant smoldering funeral pyre in the middle of town?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{move on dot org, needy! it's over. life's too short to mope over some white trash pig roast.}
<A>__{she flicks a zippo lighter and touches the flame to her tongue first tentatively, then confidently.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{that's really nice.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i tell it like it is. besides, you should be happy for me. i'm having the best day since, like jesus invented the calendar.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{jesus didn't invent the calendar.}
<A>__{jennifer giggles maniacally and sighs with happiness. needy's call waiting beeps.}
<C>__{needy }
<D>__{that's my other line.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{so blow it off.}
<A>__{she casually lights her hair on fire. the flames leap up, then die down, leaving her entirely untouched.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{it'll just be a second.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{pooh. i'm crossing you out.}
<A>__{she draws a mini x in the air. needy clicks over. it's chip. we get a nice trifold pie chart illustrating the intersecting calls. chip is panicked and sweaty in his living room. in the background, chip's little sister camille bangs on a piano. red police lights flash outside the picture window.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{i need to see you right now.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{i can barely hear you.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{camille is playing piano. knock it off, camille!}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{you knock it off!}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{can you meet me at mccullum in ten?}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{you knock it off, chip! you're penis cheese!}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{fifteen.}
<A>__{back on jennifer: jennifer is impatiently dragging a razor down her arm. blood drips onto the rug. she smiles, in awe of herself. needy clicks back over.}
<C>__{needy }
<D>__{i have to go.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{what could possibly be more important than me and my godlike powers?}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{i have to meet chip at mccullum park.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{chip is looking cute to me lately. so tell me, is he packing some serious pubic inches? what's the story down there?}
<C>__{needy}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{i gotta go.}
<A>__{needy hangs up the phone abruptly and grabs one of her many cardigan sweaters, heading for the door.}
