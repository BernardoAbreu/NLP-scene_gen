<L>__{interior death star central core shaft}
<A>__{luke and leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge that spans a huge, deep shaft that seems to go into infinity. the bridge has been retracted into the wall of the shaft, and luke almost rushes into the abyss. he loses his balance off the end of the bridge as leia, behind him, takes hold of his arm and pulls him back.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(gasping)}
<D>__{i think we took a wrong turn.}
<A>__{blasts from the stormtroopers' laser guns explode nearby reminding them of the oncoming danger. luke fires back at the advancing troops. leia reaches over and hits a switch that pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom, leaving them precariously perched on a short piece of bridge overhang. laserfire from the troopers continues to hit the steel door.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{there's no lock!}
<A>__{luke blasts the controls with his laser pistol.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{that oughta hold it for a while.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{quick, we've got to get across. find the control that extends the bridge.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{oh, i think i just blasted it.}
<A>__{luke looks at the blasted bridge control while the stormtroopers on the opposite side of the door begin making ominous drilling and pounding sounds.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{they're coming through!}
<A>__{luke notices something on his stormtrooper belt, when laserfire hits the wall behind him. luke aims his laser pistol at a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge overhang across the abyss from them. they exchange fire. two more troops appear on another overhang, also firing. a trooper is hit, and grabs at his chest. another trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by luke's laserfire, and plummets down the shaft. troopers move back off the bridge; luke hands the gun to leia.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{here, hold this.}
<A>__{luke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility belt. it has a grappler hook on it. a trooper appears on a bridge overhang and fires at luke and leia. as luke works with the rope, leia returns the laser volley. another trooper appears and fires at them, as leia returns his fire as well. suddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing the feet of more troops.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{here they come!}
<A>__{leia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above, and he falls into the abyss. luke tosses the rope across the gorge and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes. he tugs on the rope to make sure it is secure, then grabs the princess in his arms. leia looks at luke, then kisses him quickly on the lips. luke is very surprised.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{for luck!}
<A>__{luke pushes off and they swing across the treacherous abyss to the corresponding hatchway on the opposite side. just as luke and leia reach the far side of the canyon, the stormtroopers break through the hatch and begin to fire at the escaping duo. luke returns the fire before ducking into the tiny subhallway.}
