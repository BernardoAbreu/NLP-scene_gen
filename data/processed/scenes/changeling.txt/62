<L>__{interior walter's bedroom night}
<A>__{"walter" is in bed, his back to the door, as christine appears in the hallway. she steps into the room, sits on the bed. changeling a true story he doesn't move. her voice is soft, but firm.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{i was wrong to yell at you. you're still a child, and i think you don't really understand what you're doing, the hurt you're causing. maybe this is all just some big game of pretend to you, but i need you to understand. walter is...he's all i have, he's everything to me, and every day we lose because of this puts him further away from where i can help him.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{whatever the police think, whatever the world thinks, we know the truth, don't we? we both know you're not walter. getting you to admit that may be the only chance i have to straighten this out before it's too late. maybe you're afraid of getting in trouble, that you're in too deep. but you're not. you don't have to tell me who you are, you just have to tell them who you're not. just... tell them the truth.}
<A>__{he doesn't respond. she gives it a moment in case he might open up, then rises and heads back into the hallway. she switches off the light and heads off down the hallway.}
