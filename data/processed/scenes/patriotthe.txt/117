<L>__{exterior small british fort day}
<A>__{cornwallis, with his command staff clustered around him, sits on horseback reading the dispatch as the dispatch rider waits. they're on a hillside, looking over the burned out remains of a small british fort as some redcoats pull the union jack out of a trench latrine. cornwallis motions tarleton and they ride a few yards from the other officers and speak, out of earshot.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{from general clinton in new york...}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"... your request to move north is denied until you have properly dealt with your militia problem."}
<P>__{(aside)}
<D>__{he underlined, 'militia'.}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"you have spent over six months dealing with a six week problem. it is essential that you quell the militia..."}
<P>__{(aside)}
<D>__{underlined again.}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"... insurgency, particularly because of the likely move south of washington and the inevitable arrival of the french. militia, as you have so often pointed out, is not worth the attention of a significant army, hence it is mystifying why militia has bedeviled you for so long..."}
<A>__{tarleton smiles slightly, enjoying the show.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"... it is my fervent hope that the vigor of your campaign comes to match the vigor of your correspondence with your parliamentary and court patrons. only then might you share in the victory, on the verge of which i now stand."}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{"your guardedly respectful commander, general sir george clinton."}
<A>__{cornwallis grows eerily calm and turns to tarleton.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{if i fail, you fail.}
<C>__{tarleton}
<D>__{perhaps.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{and if i triumph, you triumph.}
<C>__{tarleton}
<D>__{probably.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{how can we end this madness?}
<C>__{tarleton}
<D>__{difficult, sir. this is, as you pointed out, a civil war.}
<A>__{cornwallis takes a moment, then speaks simply.}
<C>__{cornwallis}
<D>__{civility is a secondary virtue. it is superseded by duty.}
<C>__{tarleton}
<D>__{i understand, sir.}
<A>__{tarleton salutes, yanks his reins, turning his horse, and rides off.}
