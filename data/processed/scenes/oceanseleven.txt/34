<L>__{exterior bank one minute later}
<A>__{the men exit through the front doors, their hands over their heads, basher trailing them. policemen and swat members encircle the group, weapons trained on them, chock full of instructions.}
<L>__{exterior police car later}
<A>__{basher sits in the rear, handcuffed behind his back, feet on the pavement. an explosives cop kneels in front of him.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{and that's all you used during the event? nothing else?}
<C>__{basher}
<D>__{are you accusing me of booby trapping?}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{well, how 'bout it?}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{booby traps aren't mr. tarr's style.}
<A>__{the cop turns; standing behind him, stone faced, is rusty, in a dark suit and shades.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{isn't that right, basher?}
<C>__{basher}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{rusty}
<P>__{(flashing badge, briefly)}
<D>__{peck, a.t.f. let me venture a guess. a simple g4 mainliner, double coil, backwound, quick fuse with a drag under 20 feet.}
<P>__{(off cop's reaction)}
<D>__{that's our man. tell me something else. have you checked him for booby traps on his person? i mean really checked, not just for weapons...}
<A>__{the cop looks bewildered. rusty steps forward, yanks basher onto his feet, spins him around. he moves his hands up and down basher's legs, around his waist, under his arms.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{will you go find griggs and tell him i need to see him?}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{rusty}
<P>__{(loud)}
<D>__{just go find him, will you?}
<P>__{(as cop stalks off; under his breath)}
<D>__{how fast can you put something together with what i passed you?}
<C>__{basher}
<D>__{done. thirty seconds all right?}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{from when?}
<C>__{basher}
<P>__{(as we hear something}
<D>__{snap from behind his}
<P>__{back)}
<D>__{now.}
<B>__{moving with rusty and basher}
<A>__{they're hurrying; ahead of them is a wall of squad cars, a police cordon, and a crowd of onlookers.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{ten seconds?}
<C>__{basher}
<D>__{not quite. is danny here?}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{around the corner.}
<C>__{basher}
<D>__{be good working with professionals again.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{okay: go.}
<A>__{and they both start running.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{everyone down! get down! there's a bomb in the...}
<A>__{and behind them the squad car erupts with a bang! a collective scream rises from the crowd, everyone ducks, cops hit the ground and cover their heads. rusty and basher move briskly past them, dodging their splayed legs like tires on an obstacle course. by the time the explosives cop thinks to look around for basher, they've both disappeared.}
