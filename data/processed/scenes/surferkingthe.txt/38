<A>__{robbie is walking on the seawall that separates the bay from the sunning area, tightrope style. katie walks next to him.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{so...what made your folks pick up from beautiful southern california and move to colorado?}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{not both my folks. just my mom.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{aha...trouble in paradise?}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{let's just say my father had an eye for his administrative assistant, and now they're both somewhere in mexico. mom got a job here, some of her family's here, so they said "colorady is the place you outta be".}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{it could be worse.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{well, i must admit, i've met some very nice people.}
<P>__{(looking down and smiling)}
<D>__{in california, the attitude's a little different. here, not everyone is out to prove something. seem's like everyone just wants to have fun.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{i have a theory. sometimes it snows here so hard, that it's a challenge just to get to work or to school. everything shuts down for a day or so. if your car gets stuck, people appear from nowhere to help pull you out and get you back on the road. most people here don't just look out for themselves. a lot of times, they're looking out for you, too.}
