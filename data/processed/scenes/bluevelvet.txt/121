<L>__{77. interior "slow club" night}
<A>__{later. jeffrey and sandy have just finished dinner. the m.c. is arranging a floral art deco microphone and a saxophone player, a bass player, and a drummer are on stage.}
<C>__{m.c.}
<P>__{(very low key)}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen. the blue lady. miss dorothy vallens.}
<A>__{there is quite a round of applause, even though most people continue laughing, talking, and drinking. dorothy vallens comes out on stage. she smiles. the house lights are still up. as she sings the first lines of "blue moon" the house lights go down and a blue spot light comes up on her as she sings the word, "blue." this is a very sexy and slow version of the song. during the song, jeffrey and sandy look at one another with the thought that this is the woman whose apartment they are about to break into. jeffrey and sandy leave as dorothy starts her next song, "blue velvet." they hear the first few lines before they get out the door.}
