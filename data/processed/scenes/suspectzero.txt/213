<L>__{00."}
<A>__{mackelway looks to the conference table that huge stack of faxes, all those helpless faces. the one on top is the one that came in last night: lloyd simms, age 9. ht. 4'10", wt. 67 lbs. last seen: greenville, texas. date of disappearance: 10 26 99. at last, a pattern. a break. mackelway grabs the simms fax, hurries out of the room. nearest agent is grieves. mackelway hands him the fax.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{need an address on this fax line.}
<A>__{grieves has done this on fifty different faxes now; it never yields their suspect, but:}
<C>__{grieves}
<D>__{'kay.}
<A>__{mackelway leans back in to the o'ryan room.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{o'ryan's in greenville.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{what makes you think so?}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{that's where zero is.}
<P>__{(fran's a blank)}
<D>__{lloyd simms october 26, '99. karen sumpter october 26, 2000. both disappeared from greenville.}
<P>__{(still no reply)}
<D>__{zero comes back to the same spot, once a year. today's the 25th.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{wait. when did we establish that zero was real?}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{o'ryan thinks so.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{do you?}
<A>__{that's the million dollar question, and it hangs there. mackelway's about to answer... when he stops himself. just noticing something. that morgue photo from logan, utah: there's a burn mark on the lower left calf of the victim. we've seen such a mark before, on another autopsy photo.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{i've seen this before.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{huh?}
<A>__{he doesn't answer, just hurries to a thick box of other autopsy files and photos. starts rifling through them... ...until he finds the one we've seen before. the body from trenton. he extracts it. eyes it. a confirmation... he lays the two photos side by side. looks to fran.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{same burn mark.}
<P>__{(she leans in)}
<D>__{i saw it before but it didn't register.}
<A>__{fran eyes the photos. no doubt about it they both have the same burn mark on the lower left calf: a symmetrical, almost horizontal stripe across the flesh.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{he burns them?}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{i dunno. almost looks too symmetrical to be a burn.}
<P>__{(re: logan victim)}
<D>__{they're autopsying her this morning?}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{she gets the idea: "find out where the hell this mark on the leg came from." grieves enters.}
<C>__{grieves}
<D>__{fax number traces back to a copy center on i 30. greenville.}
<P>__{(mackelway eyes his watch)}
<D>__{i called. they don't open for another hour.}
<A>__{mackelway looks to fran. she's not entirely sold yet... but she's getting there.}
