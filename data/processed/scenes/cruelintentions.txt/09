<L>__{interior valmont townhouse living room day}
<A>__{a enormous living room by manhattan standards, with a view that overlooks the park. eclectic art from around the world emphasize the valmont's passion for travel. sook hee, the valmont's housekeeper sets a tray of sushi in front of kathryn merteuil, a seventeen year old porcelain skinned wasp with all the grooming you could want in an east coast child. she sits with a forced smile on her face and listens attentively as bunny caldwell, a forty year old nouveau riche socialite talks incessantly. cecile caldwell, her beautiful teenage daughter, sits by her side. she wears a t shirt with a koala bear on it.}
<C>__{mrs. caldwell}
<D>__{i can't tell you how happy we are that cecile is going to be attending oakwood with you this fall. you've always been an inspiration to beau and i on raising her. we just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{i will do my best.}
<A>__{sook hee pours a dish of soy sauce in front of kathryn.}
<C>__{kathryn }
<P>__{(to sook hee, in vietnamese)}
<D>__{thank you, sook hee. that will be all.}
<A>__{sook hee leaves.}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{i was thanking her. vietnamese is such a beautiful language.}
<C>__{mrs. caldwell }
<D>__{kathryn is a straight a student at oakwood as well as being president of the french club. listen to whatever she has to say and you'll go far.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<P>__{(in french)}
<D>__{you're too kind.}
<C>__{mrs. caldwell}
<D>__{how do you do it? i mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. where do you get your strength?}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{i know this sounds corny, but whenever i feel temptations of peer pressure, i...}
<P>__{(takes out her crucifix)}
<D>__{turn to god and he helps me through the problem. call me an anachronism, but it works.}
<C>__{mrs. caldwell}
<D>__{that's beautiful.}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{what are the boys like?}
<C>__{mrs. caldwell}
<D>__{cecile, is that the best you can do?}
<P>__{(to kathryn)}
<D>__{you must forgive her, kathryn. she's never been in a co educational atmosphere before.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{don't worry, it's totally understandable. most of the boys that matriculate at oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.}
<C>__{mrs. caldwell}
<D>__{like your step brother sebastian. i can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{i hear she's recovering quite well.}
<A>__{mrs. caldwell turns to see sebastian standing in the doorway. he walks over and takes a seat.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{nice to see you again, mrs. caldwell.}
<C>__{mrs. caldwell}
<D>__{you remember my daughter, cecile.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{my, what an adorable shirt you're wearing.}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{my father just took me on a trip to australia.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{how are things down under? blossoming i hope.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{cecile's attending oakwood in the fall.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{outstanding.}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{what year are you in?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i'm what you would call a fifth year senior.}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{but i thought high school is only four years.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{it is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.}
<A>__{he winks at cecile.}
<C>__{mrs. caldwell}
<D>__{i think we'll be going now.}
<P>__{(to kathryn)}
<D>__{thanks for all your help.}
<A>__{kathryn stands and approaches cecile.}

<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{thanks.}
<P>__{(to sebastian)}
<D>__{nice meeting you.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{ciao.}
<C>__{mrs. caldwell}
<D>__{let's go, cecile. now!}
<A>__{cecile follows mrs. caldwell out the door. kathryn closes the door behind them.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{do you care to tell me what mrs. white trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{i'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.}
<A>__{kathryn sits on the sofa next to sebastian. she unscrews her crucifix. the top part becomes a small spoon and the bottom part a small vial of coke.}
<C>__{kathryn }
<D>__{the parental units called while you were out.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{lovely. how is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying bali? zipping through my inheritance per usual?}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid.}
<A>__{kathryn uses her crucifix as a coke spoon and snorts a bump.}
<C>__{kathryn }
<D>__{what's wrong with you today? therapy not going well?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{it was fine.}
<A>__{he leaps off the sofa and starts to pace.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{i'm sick of sleeping with these insipid manhattan debutantes.}
<A>__{he walks over to the wall where nude botticelli hangs.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{nothing shocks them anymore.}
<A>__{he scratches the nude's pubic area.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{i'm beginning to feel like i'm losing my touch.}
<A>__{he kisses it.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{oh, poor baby. well you can relax. i have a mission for you.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{what?}
