<D>__{good. now i'm going to slap you. ready?}
<C>__{stemler}
<D>__{yeah but not so hard.}
<A>__{mike gives him an odd half slap and stemler runs out to the mat and takes his place at the line. the team cheers. but then the other wrestler runs out. he is wearing a black protective face mask. stemler spins away from the line and looks pleading at mike.}
<C>__{stemler }
<D>__{holy shit! it's darth vader! are you kidding me? no way!}
<A>__{he does look like darth vader. but in a singlet.}

<C>__{stemler}
<D>__{yeah. you're right.}
<A>__{stemler returns to the line slightly more confident. the ref blows the whistle and the match starts. stemler is immediately taken down. terry looks at his feet.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{i can't watch. later }
<A>__{it's late in third period. stemler is losing 13 0. stemler is flat on his belly and he's getting mauled. the ref calls him for stalling. one pointerior 14 0. thirty seconds to go.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{keep moving, stemler. keep working!}
<C>__{vigman}
<P>__{(reading score card)}
<D>__{oh shit. oh shit!}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{vigman}
<D>__{he's one point away from a tech fall and we'd lose on criteria.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{shit. really?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{what the hell does that mean?}
<C>__{vigman}
<D>__{if he falls behind by fifteen points it's a technical fall. they get five team points. if that happens the score would be tied but we'd lose the match on criteria.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{seriously?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{fuck this!}
<A>__{mike drops to the mat.}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{stemler! stemler!!}
<A>__{stemler looks over. his eyes are wild.}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{you need to get up! he's trying to drown you! he wants you dead. but you are not going to die on the bottom! do you hear me? do you?!}
<A>__{stemler manages a nod, albeit a terrified one.}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{good! now just do the move we worked on in practice.}
<A>__{off stemler's confused look.}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{"whatever the fuck it takes!"}
<A>__{stemler almost manages a smile and then he hits "the move". it's not pretty but somehow he manages to get up and out. the team goes nuts. one point for stemler. 15 1. the other kid frantically tries to take him down but stemler holds him off dancing wildly around the mat. the buzzer sounds. the team goes nuts. the ref raises the other wrestler's hand in victory but it's stemler who celebrates as if he just won the states. he runs off the mat and into the arms of his teammates.}
