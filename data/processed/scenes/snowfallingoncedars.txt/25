<A>__{hatsue sits at a bedroom mirror. mrs. shigemura watching analytically, as hatsue weaves her hair into a thick plait.}
<C>__{mrs. shigemura}
<D>__{no. you must never look at a man directly. this is part of grace.}
<A>__{the girl smiles a small sour smile. speaks quietly...}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{i don't think the boys on this island. are impressed. by grace.}
<A>__{the old woman studies her without irritation.}
<C>__{mrs. shigemura}
<D>__{hakujin know nothing of life, hatsue.}
<A>__{apparently, the girl has heard this before.}
<C>__{mrs. shigemura}
<D>__{this is why they fear death. because life here is separate from being.}
<A>__{the girl takes a long pin. begins carefully to fasten her hair. breaking eye contact with the mirror.}
<C>__{mrs. shigemura}
<D>__{it is why they have no soul.}
<A>__{is the girl even listening? the old woman's voice never rises. remains patient.}
<C>__{mrs. shigemura}
<D>__{life embraces death, includes it. this truth brings tranquility. you must see yourself...}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{...as a leaf. on a great tree.}
<A>__{no irony in the girl's voice. no disrespect. the old woman reads the young face in the mirror.}
<C>__{mrs. shigemura}
<D>__{the pin. could be better placed.}
