<L>__{interior bryan burke's office morning}
<A>__{bryan cowers behind his desk as george enters with his model in one hand and the long wooden stick in the other.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i will take this one, if that's okay?}
<A>__{it takes bryan a few aborted attempts to answer before he simply nods.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{thank you for going out on a limb and allowing me one.}
<A>__{bryan nods again, then quivers as george steps forward, leans the stick against the desk and extends his hand.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{you're a great architect and a miserable human being.}
<A>__{bryan winces as he extends his hand. they shake hands and george grabs hold of the stick again.}
<C>__{bryan}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{george walks around the desk and bashes in a model hidden on the floor, one that bryan had obviously wanted to save.}
<C>__{bryan }
<D>__{oh, fuck!}
<A>__{george drops the wooden spool and walks out of the office as bryan garners the courage to stand.}
<C>__{bryan }
<D>__{you're not even an architect and you're a miserable human being.}
<A>__{george turns around only long enough to answer.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you're right. you win.}
<A>__{george closes the door behind him. bryan stares down at the remains of the model; he gets down on his knees and carefully gathers up the pieces.}
