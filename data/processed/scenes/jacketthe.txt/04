<T>__{flashback to:}
<L>__{exterior iraqi village, day}
<A>__{we see only the hand, and not the man to whom it belongs, enter the frame and pull the trigger on a gun. the sound pierces the air, and the bullet hits the side of starks' head in a flash, shaving the skin around it right off.}
<L>__{exterior american naval hospital, day}
<A>__{starks convalesces in a navy hospital bed his head heavily bandaged and his arms suited with i.v.'s and dressings as a major, a lieutenant and a doctor stand above him. starks' face now cleaned of the blood that masked it before is alert, and striking. even with the bandages, he remains well built and strong, like a shot straight to the head would have been the only way for an enemy to take him down.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{sergeant starks was very lucky. a little more to the right and it wouldn't have wanted to come out...}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{but he's never gonna be able to remember what happened?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{it's hard to say. sergeant starks could have retrograde amnesia or... [lowering his voice] any form of psychological suppression. it's very common with traumas like this. starks [cutting him off] sergeant starks is in the room, [beat] and i want to know when i'm going home.}
<A>__{when he speaks, starks maintains the sharp, steady gaze of a man assured of himself, even if he is lost among his surroundings.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{sergeant, you have no surviving family in the states. i'm sure you have friends or distant relatives, but unfortunately we have no record of them yet.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{captain medley has recommended you for the purple heart, sergeant.}
<A>__{starks lets the tribute roll right off him. he spots the cigarettes in the lieutenant's pocket.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{can i have one of those?}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{the lieutenant lights one for him.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{there is help for you, sergeant.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{of course there is.}
<A>__{their voices start to fade as starks smokes his cigarette, blowing the smoke upwards and following it with his eyes. he's finished with these men and everything they stand for.}
<D>__{starks [v.o.] i didn't know where my home was. i just knew i didn't want to be there anymore.}
