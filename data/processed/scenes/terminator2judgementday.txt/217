<L>__{89a wider. john walks around terminator and looks at his face.}
<A>__{eyes open, he is completely inert. dead. john lifts his huge hand. the dead servos whine sullenly as he forces them. it's like rigor mortis. he releases the hand and it stays in the lifted position. sarah examines the cpu chip.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{can you see the pin switch?}
<A>__{she ignores him. see looks at terminator. the back at the chip. then she sets it on the work table and picks up a small sledge hammer. john realizes what she is about to do. dives at her as the sledge is whistling down.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no!!!!}
<A>__{he slaps his hand down over the chip. sarah barely stops the sledge before smashing his fingers.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{out of the way, john!}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no! don't kill him!}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{it, john. not him. it.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{alright, it! we need it!}
<A>__{john keeps his hand right where it is.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{we're better off by ourselves.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{but it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i don't trust it! these things are hard to kill, john, believe me, i know. we may never have this opportunity again.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{look, mom, if i'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while. 'cause if you won't, nobody else will.}
<A>__{smart kid. he's got her. she nods, reluctantly. he palms the chip and studies it minutely.}
