<L>__{exterior downtown portland}
<A>__{the news chopper at first shows casey's destroyed car laying in the street, then pans back up to show andrew, who's floating hunched over, vomiting. matt flies up behind him, and tries to help him, but andrew shoves him away. we're too far away to hear anything that's said. matt tries again, and andrew yells something. matt, clearly upset, replies. andrew, talking fast and jerky, gestures towards his burns. matt tries to reply several times, but andrew isn't hearing it. matt smiles nervously at the destruction, and says something gently. andrew replies, and whatever is said here, it causes a radical shift in matt's demeanor. he's no longer concerned; he seems repulsed. andrew says more, clearly screaming at matt. matt seems to beg andrew for something and andrew relents. matt continues, more forcefully, and then notices something to his right. a bus smashes him out of the air, swatting him}
<B>__{like a bug into the side of an apartment complex.}
<A>__{andrew suddenly turns, flailing an arm at us in the chopper; a mailbox comes crashing up into the camera. from michael ernesto's camera. michael ernesto is, along with several other people from his building, out on his roof. he watches in horror as the helicopter andrew hit goes out of control, falling out of frame. moments later, we hear the explosion as it crashes.}
<C>__{michael ernesto }
<D>__{oh, oh no, those people, man, those people, oh god }
<C>__{ernesto's neighbor }
<D>__{where's the other guy?}
<C>__{michael ernesto }
<D>__{he's fucking dead man, you saw oh shit oh shit }
<A>__{andrew comes toppling down out of the sky like a wounded bird, crashing into the roof. he vomits again, mostly bile; everyone around him is in shock, frozen, as he screams in pain and rolls over. he's bleeding badly from the nose and ears.}
<C>__{andrew}
<P>__{(agonized, crying)}
<D>__{no one's gonna help me...no one's gonna help me now...}
<A>__{we get some shots from other people's cameras, video phones, etc on the roof. some people scream and try to run past andrew, and he blasts them off the roof like bowling pins, which leads to more screaming. andrew stands shakily, looking directly at michael ernesto.}
<C>__{michael ernesto }
<D>__{please man, please, i don't know you man }
<C>__{andrew}
<P>__{(mumbled)}
<D>__{what type of camera is that?}

<D>__{what? i don't know, i don't know you man, i didn't please okay, please }
<A>__{andrew starts to raise an arm, when he's suddenly nailed by matt, blasting by at well over eighty miles an hour.}
<B>__{from bank security camera.}
<A>__{the inside of the bank is quiet and peaceful, when matt and}
<B>__{andrew come crashing through the roof. from police car dashboard cam.}
<A>__{the police car rockets up the street, but has to screech to a halt when matt and andrew come exploding out of the front of}
<B>__{the bank.}
<A>__{the two of them brawl in the street for a moment; it's not impressive martial arts, or even super powered, just two guys fighting for their lives. matt gets the upperhand, decking andrew and driving him to the ground, and suddenly the cop car (our pov), lifts off. we go flying into matt, crashing out the camera as he turns and creates a telekinetic wall. from cala prenti's camera. cala, filming from her apartment window, watches in shock and horror as the police car, carried by its momentum, is sent flipping into the air, and we glimpse it as it passes her window, lights still flaring. her sister rushes up, looking out the window.}
<C>__{cala }
<D>__{sissy stay away from the window!}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{what's happening what's happening }
<C>__{cala }
<D>__{they're right out there fighting! they're }
<A>__{andrew and matt come blasting up through the floor in the kitchen off to the right, and then out through the ceiling. from kpr portland's helicam. the two boys come smashing up through the roof of the apartment building. andrew flies low, and matt gives chase. andrew turns, beginning to telekinetically lob everything at street level at matt; traffic lights, parking meters, trees, etc... ...but matt's too good a flyer. what he doesn't block he simply dips and weaves around. andrew, clearly still woozy, is distracted and smashes into a street light, wiping out on the asphalt.}
<D>__{camera man they're down. one of them just went down. jesus christ.}
<A>__{matt slowly lands nearby. the camera zooms in and hits them both with a spotlight, causing matt to shield his eyes and look up, scared, as andrew struggles to stand. we get a good look at the toll this is taking on him; matt's face is a crimson mask of blood from his nose, eyes, mouth and ears. he's limping badly, his clothes torn, visibly covered with injuries. he looks like he's been in a car wreck.}
<P>__{camera man (cont'd)}
<D>__{oh shit, look at him.}
<A>__{he approaches andrew, talking again, more fervently. andrew just shakes his head, falling repeatedly as he tries to stand, like a wounded dog. two cop cars skid to a halt nearby, the officers unloading and taking cover. one of them advances on matt and andrew, gun raised. matt goes out in front of andrew, protective, pleading, raising his hands. the cop is clearly panicked. he fires a shot. matt's arm whips out, impossible fast; he buckles and screams in pain, holding his hand, which is gushing blood.}
<D>__{andrew blasts the}
<A>__{matt falls, screaming, and andrew stands. officers backwards.}
<P>__{camera man (cont'd)}
<D>__{oh shit! oh jesus christ!}
<A>__{andrew approaches matt, screaming and looking absolutely terrifying. matt turns and rockets off into the sky, andrew following a second later, tackling matt out of the air. from kpr portland's live on the scene. we're at street level in downtown, people are absolutely everywhere, wandering out into the street, baffled, scared and looking for answers. a field reporter fixes herself, preparing to speak.}
<C>__{field reporter}
<D>__{are we...okay, yeah, gimme two, one we're live on the scene on parson boulevard just south of the center of downtown, and }
<A>__{there's a rushing, screeching sound from around the corner. the camera jerks, and moves towards the corner, the cameraman man running to see what the sound is.}
<C>__{field reporter }
<D>__{shawn, wait, you're unplugged. shawn }
<A>__{something around the corner explodes, and matt comes flying past overhead, slightly on fire, before andrew comes lunging at matt, catching him, twisting out and over the camera man,}
<B>__{slamming him into the side of a skyscraper on the street.}
<A>__{andrew lifts matt up high into the air, scraping him against buildings on either side of the street, bouncing like a pinball until from abc 5's helicam. matt struggles, and there's a visible ripple in the air; a massive concussive burst, sending both of them rocketing downwards as though shot out of a cannon. they strike the massive bronze statue of "portlandia," a trident wielding demigoddess, in front of the michael graves building, uprooting it from its pedestal before crashing to the ground. matt's body accordions brutally when he lands, and he flops down at a broken, dead angle. andrew lands nearly as badly, lays still for a moment, and then begins twitching and screaming when the chopper's spotlight hits him. from michael graves' building exterior security camera the statue of portlandia lays awkwardly in the street. andrew writhes. matt is motionless, blood pooling around him, his back broken. from police dashboard cams, helicopter cameras, handhelds from windows, everything. a bunch of squad cars and emergency units converge around the front of the michael graves building and downed statue. matt and andrew's bodies are painted by spotlights as police and news helicopters hang overhead. police unload en mass, guns out, immediately forming a perimeter and pushing in. we're with them as they approach; the mood is of barely controlled panic, officers shouting back and forth to each other. andrew and matt are polka dotted by red laser sight dots. andrew suddenly stands up, and several officers fire; the bullets spark off an invisible barrier in front of him, and he shakily raises both hands. the all of the police officers, firemen and paramedics are telekinetically lifted into the air. they hang struggling for a moment, and then all of their limbs go rigid. we've seen this before. andrew screams, and then...it all happens in under two seconds: matt swings an arm, blinding fast; the triton wielding arm of portlandia bends jaggedly, bringing down the pitchfork hard, first through andrew, then into the pavement. andrew stands impaled, a look of shock on his face, and then matt flails up his hand; the bullet lodged inside fires out, striking andrew in the head, killing him instantly. all of the floating people drop, dazed. matt collapses. after a moment, the police advance.}
