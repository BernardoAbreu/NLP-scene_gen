<L>__{exterior platte city motel. night.}
<A>__{the four lawmen, among them the deputy from the cafe, edge their way across the lawn, past the first garage, past the second. before they reach the door of bonnie and clyde's cabin, the window smashes and there are blasts of gunfire. one cop is hit and falls, the others run back to the cars for cover. bonnie and c.w. are at the window, firing steadily. clyde running into the garage to get the car. they must escape. all they can do is escape, and all they have is that one car in the closed garage. outside. two of the lawmen fall to the ground, shot. as the remaining two run back for cover, we see a blinding light rolling up in a space between the six cars. it is an armored truck, with mounted guns and and spotlight, advancing toward the cabin. inside the armored truck. two men in the seat. sounds of gunshots coming from everywhere, piercing light. from inside the truck, we suddenly see the windshield shattered from bullets fired by bonnie and c.w. the driver is hit, and he slumps over the wheel. his body hits the horn, which starts blasting and continues throughout the battle. the other man, quickly, ducks under the dashboard for protection. inside the garage. clyde standing by the car. he holds the browning automatic. the garage door is shaking from the impact of bullets, shattering. his gun already firing (automatic clip) before he gets there. clyde in a crouch runs to the garage door, flings it up, and runs back inside the car. now the door is open and he can get the car out. one hand on the wheel, one hand shooting, he rolls the car out onto the driveway. the battle is raging from all sides.}
