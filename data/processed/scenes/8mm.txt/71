<L>__{interior mathews house, mary's room day}
<A>__{mrs. mathews enters. welles follows. this was the girl's room, exactly as she left it posters of actors on the wall, many stuffed animals on the pink sheets of the carefully made bed. perfectly preserved.}
<C>__{mrs mathews}
<D>__{this is her room.}
<A>__{welles looks around, uncomfortable. shelves have pictures of mary with female friends, a collection of ceramic figurines of clowns and animals.}
<C>__{mrs mathews}
<D>__{the police made a wreck of it, but i put it back exactly how it was. just how she likes it.}
<A>__{welles takes a few steps into the room, looks down at a desk where there are six brightly wrapped gifts.}
<C>__{mrs mathews}
<D>__{those are for her birthday. one for every year she's missed. they'll be waiting for her when she comes back.}
<A>__{welles is nearly overwhelmed by sadness, struggling to hide it. he backs to the door, looks at his watch...}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{i... i shouldn't take anymore of your time. maybe we can finish tomorrow. i will call tomorrow...}
<C>__{mrs mathews}
<D>__{okay.}
