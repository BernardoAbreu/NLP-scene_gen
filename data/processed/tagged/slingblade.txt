<A>__{two young women, marsha dwiggins, carrying a briefcase, and theresa evans, carrying two camera bags are being led down the hallway by a guard.}

<D>__{in a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. that doesn't bother you?}
<C>__{theresa}
<D>__{hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.}

<C>__{marsha}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<C>__{woolridge}
<D>__{i think there must have been a little mix up. i told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. it's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?}
<C>__{marsha}
<D>__{well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. but it has pictures. i mean it's a regular paper, you know.}
<C>__{woolridge}
<D>__{karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. he wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the easter collage.}

<D>__{i don't think he's talked to a woman in twenty five or so years. that i know of anyway. that's why i said to send a man. at least maybe he'd answer a question or two for a man. i'm all for helping the college out, believe me. it might be a real good article or story.}
<C>__{marsha}
<D>__{can't you talk to him? maybe talk him into it. i'm a real good interviewer. just get me in the room with him.}

<D>__{you see, karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. he couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother. but, his father made sure that his mother knew what the bible said. and she made sure karl knew. you know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right?}
<C>__{marsha}
<D>__{i knew he slept in a toolshed.}
<C>__{woolridge}

<D>__{before they were married?}
<C>__{woolridge}
<D>__{i don't think so. just period, i think. she told him... god gave them the ugliest creation he could think of. karl has an entire book a notebook. on every page it says "franklin chapter 1 verse number 1." he wrote that a few years ago after he'd learned to write. his father's name was franklin.}
<C>__{marsha}

<L>__{interior hallway day}
<A>__{melvin and karl walk down the hallway. woolridge stands outside the door of the classroom. they reach him and woolridge talks quietly to karl.}

<D>__{karl, you know, do you remember when i told you about those people from that newspaper?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{they want to ask you some questions about your release. they think it would make an interesting story. will you talk to 'em? get interviewed.}

<C>__{woolridge}
<D>__{well, it surprised the dickens out of me. he said he'll talk to you.}
<A>__{marsha smiles and looks at theresa.}
<C>__{woolridge }
<D>__{but, here's the thing. he'll only talk to you. he doesn't want you to ask him anything. and you shouldn't stare at him.}
<C>__{marsha}
<D>__{how am i going to conduct an interview if i can't ask him any questions?}
<C>__{woolridge}
<D>__{it's the best you're gonna get. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{marsha}
<D>__{can i ask you a question? if he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? what if he does it again? it happens all the time.}
<C>__{woolridge}
<D>__{he's free. his time's up. that's the rules. he's been treated and reevaluated. he doesn't show any signs any more.}

<D>__{you'll have to step outside.}
<A>__{theresa starts to protest.}
<C>__{woolridge }
<D>__{please.}
<A>__{karl sits down in a folding chair near a lamp as melvin ushers theresa outside into the hallway. karl sits staring at the floor. rubbing his palms together and breathing strangely, as usual. he sits silent for what seems like forever.}

<L>__{interior classroom day}
<A>__{marsha is staring at karl. karl, still breathing and rubbing his palms, starts to speak. his voice is low and raspy, but not just low and raspy; strange.}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{well, i reckon what you're a wanting to know is what i'm doing in here. i reckon the reason i'm in here is 'cause i killed somebody. but i reckon what you was a wanting to know is how come me to kill somebody. well, i reckon i will start at the front and tell you.}
<P>__{(pause, heavy breathing)}
<D>__{i lived most of my life out behind my mother and father's house in a little old shed and my daddy'd built for me. they didn't too much want me up there in the house with the rest of 'em. i mostly just set around out there in the shed all the time a lookin' at the ground. it didn't have no floor but i had me a hole dug out to lay down in and a quilt or tow that i put down there.}
<P>__{(pause, more breathing)}
<D>__{my daddy was a hard workin' man most of his life, not that i can say the same fer myself. i most just set around the shed and tinkered around with a lawn mower or two and went to school off and on from time to time but the children there made quite a bit of sport of me, made fun of me quite a bit. some of 'em roughed me up sometimes so mostly i stayed out back there in the shed. my daddy worked down at the sawmill there, down there at the planer mill for an old man named dixon. old man dixon was a very cruel feller, he didn't treat his employees very well, didn't pay 'em much of a wage, didn't pay my daddy much of a wage, just barely enough to get by on. but i reckon he got by all right, they come out one or the other of 'em, usually my mother, and fed me pretty regular. at least i know he made enough for me to have mustard and biscuits three or four times a week. old man dixon had a boy named jesse dixon. jesse was really more cruel than his daddy. he made quite a bit of sport of me and takened advantage of the little girls around the neighborhood quite a bit.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{he used to say my mother was a very pretty woman. he said it quite a bit from time to time, when i was at the school house. well, i reckon you want me to get on and tell you what happened so i reckon i will tell you. i was settin' out in the shed one evenin' not doin' too much, just kindly starin' at the wall and a waitin' fer my mother to come out and give me my bible lesson and i heared a commotion up in the house there so i got up and run up on the screened in porch there to see what was a goin' on, and i looked in the kitchen window and i seen my mother a layin' there on the floor without any clothes on.}
<P>__{(pause, breathing)}
<D>__{and seen jesse dixon a layin' on top of her having his way with her.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{well, i just seen red. i picked up a kaiser blade that was a layin' there by the screen door, some folks calls it a sling blade, i call it a kaiser blade. it's just a long handle like a axe handle with a long blade on it that's shaped kind of like a banana. sharp on one edge and dull on the other. it's what the highway boys use to cut down weeds and whatnot. i went in the kitchen there and i hit jesse dixon up side the head with it and knocked him off my mother. i reckon that didn't quite satisfy me so i hit him again in the neck with the sharp edge and just plumb near cut his head off. killed him. well, my mother, she jumped up from there and started yellin', "what did you kill jesse fer? what did you kill jesse fer?"}
<P>__{(pause, intense breathing)}
<D>__{well, come to find out my mother didn't really mind what jesse was a doin' to her. i reckon that made me madder than what jesse had made me. i takened the kaiser blade, some folks calls it a sling blade, i call it a kaiser blade and hit my mother up side the head with it an' killed her.}
<P>__{(long pause, breathing)}
<D>__{some folks has asked me if i had it to do over again would i do the same thing. i don't know, i reckon i would. anyhow, they seen fit to put me in here and here i've been for a great long while. i've learned to read some; took me four years to read the bible. i reckon i understand a good deal of it. it wasn't what i expected in a lot of places. i've slept in a good bed for a great long while. they've seen fit to put me out now. they tell me they're a settin' me free today. anyhow, i reckon that's all you need to know. if you want any more details i reckon i can tell 'em to you. i don't know if that's enough for your newspaper or not.}
<A>__{suddenly marsha speaks from the darkness.}
<C>__{marsha}
<D>__{will you ever kill anybody again, karl?}
<A>__{this seems to startle the very room itself. woolridge motions for marsha to shut up and karl stops still. very still. he breathes hard for a moment then starts to calm down. he seems almost at ease. he slowly looks up. from karl's point of view we barely see marsha's face in the dim light. karl is looking straight at marsha.}

<P>__{(pauses for a response,}
<D>__{instead karl eats french fries and stares at the}
<P>__{table)}
<D>__{i guess i will put it right out on the table. where do i start. linda and frank are very important to me. they're like family. my own family was never like family. they're horrible people. as a matter of fact i prayed every night for years that my father would die. i finally realized through a lot of therapy that i was wasting my energy on hating him. now i just don't care.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you see, you and i are a lot alike, strange as that may seem. i mean not physically or even mentally really, just well, maybe emotionally or actually the hand we've been dealt in life. we're different. people see us as being different anyway. you're well you have your affliction or whatever and i, well mine's not as easy to see. i'm just going to say it. i'm gay.}
<P>__{(watts)}
<D>__{does that surprise you?}
<P>__{(watts)}
<D>__{that i'm gay. you know what being gay is, don't you?}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{i reckon not.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{homosexual. i like men. sexually.}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{well that's a very offensive way to put it. you shouldn't say that. you were taught that, weren't you?}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{i've heard it said that way.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. i've wanted to leave many times, but my love for linda and frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. anyway, i'm rambling. if you're going to live in the wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. doyle is a monster. not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. a dangerous person. i've told linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. maybe even kill one of them. i see it in his eyes. i'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. doyle will make your life hell. you're a perfect target. when i first saw you i was afraid of you. not really afraid, i guess, just taken aback. but also, i felt a real sensitive feeling from you. and for some reason, frank has adopted you. much like a stray animal. i'm sorry, i didn't mean it like that. in a good way. anyway, i just want you to know what you're in for. i have a good feeling about you. you're good for frank. maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. i'm sorry, i didn't mean it in a bad way.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{there's one more thing. it's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something terrible. but what i see before me is a gentle, simple man. all i want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around linda and frank. you know. you would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{i wouldn't never hurt them.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{that's what i thought. i hope i haven't offended you in any way. you seem like a thinker. you seem to always be in deep thought. tell me something. what are you thinking right now?}
<A>__{karl looks up and stares for a moment.}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{i was thinkin' i could use me another helpin' of these potaters.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{oh. how about before that?}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{before that i was thinkin' it'd be good if i could get another three or four cans of that potted meat if you got any extry.}
<L>__{interior wheatley kitchen night}

<C>__{linda}

<C>__{linda}
<D>__{he does make some funny noises.}
<C>__{frank}

<C>__{linda}
<D>__{i'm glad of it, honey.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{what have you got to be nervous about? you're a damn kid. you ain't got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady to stay on your ass all the time.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i get nervous, that's all i know.}
<A>__{they eat in silence for a while. linda and frank know where this conversation could lead and know when to leave well enough alone.}

<D>__{what?}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{you know what we ought to do tonight?}

<C>__{karl}
<D>__{my daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. i went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. hit was bloody like around that towel. hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.}

<C>__{frank}

<C>__{karl}
<D>__{i heared it cryin' a little through that box.}
<C>__{frank}

<C>__{karl}
<D>__{i wadn't but six or eight. i reckon i didn't know what to do. i didn't know how to care for no baby. mama and daddy didn't want him. they learned me to do what they told me to. these days i figure it might of been best to give him right back to the good lord right off the bat anyhow.}
