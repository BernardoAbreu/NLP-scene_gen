<A>__{a few minutes later. demora is watching her console.}
<C>__{demora}
<D>__{we're within visual range of the energy distortion, captain.}
<C>__{harriman}
<D>__{on screen.}
<A>__{include viewscreen (vfx i) which now shows a huge ribbon of crackling energy directly ahead of the enterprise b. everyone reacts to the bizarre sight.}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{what the hell is that?}
<C>__{demora}
<P>__{(off console)}
<D>__{i've found the transport ships.}
<A>__{include viewscreen (vfx i) the viewscreen now shows two transport ships trapped like insects in the violent torrent of energy. the ships are being buffeted and thrown about by large tendrils of crackling energy.}
<C>__{demora}
<P>__{(cont'd)}
<D>__{their hulls are starting to buckle under the stress they won't survive much longer.}
<A>__{the ship suddenly shakes. the navigator works his console.}
<C>__{navigator}
<D>__{we're encountering severe gravimetric distortions from the energy ribbon.}
<C>__{harriman}
<D>__{we'll have to keep our distance... we don't want to get pulled in too...}
<A>__{harriman frowns at the screen, trying to figure out what to do. kirk can barely contain himself to him the answer is obvious. he blurts out the answer }
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{tractor beam...}
<A>__{scotty quickly elbows him in the side this isn't kirk's ship. kirk shuts up. harriman glances at kirk.}
<C>__{harriman}
<D>__{we don't have a tractor beam.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{you left spacedock without a tractor beam?}
<C>__{harriman}
<D>__{it won't be installed until tuesday.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{ensign sulu... try generating a subspace field around the ships. that might break them free.}
<C>__{demora}
<D>__{aye, sir.}
<A>__{when kirk hears this order, he shakes his head slightly and mouths the word "no" under his breath. he knows that won't work.}
<C>__{demora}
<P>__{(continuing; shakes her head)}
<D>__{there's too much quantum interference, captain.}
<A>__{harriman frowns again, trying to come up with another solution, but it isn't easy it's his first day in command; his ship is under manned and ill prepared. it's a nightmare come true. kirk is itching to get in on this, his fingers digging into the arms of his chair but he restrains himself.}
<C>__{harriman}
<D>__{what about... venting plasma from the warp nacelles? that might disrupt the ribbon's hold on the ships.}
<C>__{navigator}
<D>__{aye, sir.. releasing drive plasma...}
<A>__{a tense beat. harriman glances over at the journalists, then glances over at kirk. kirk gives him a pained smile, trying to be encouraging even though he knows this is not the right course of action.}
<C>__{navigator}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{it's not having any effect, sir. i think }
<C>__{demora}
<D>__{sir! the starboard vessel's hull is collapsing }
<A>__{include viewscreen (vfx i) suddenly the right hand ship on the screen is engulfed by a fiery tendril of energy and it explodes. the other ship continues to be thrown about and buffeted. everyone reacts with shock on the bridge.}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{how many people were aboard that ship?}
<C>__{demora}
<D>__{two hundred sixty five.}
<A>__{harriman pales at the sight... seems shell shocked by the destruction of the ship. he's overwhelmed now, at a genuine loss as to what to do nexterior}
<C>__{demora}
<P>__{(urgent)}
<D>__{the lakul's hull integrity is down to twelve percent, sir.}
<A>__{harriman looks over at kirk, who has remained quiet during this entire sequence only through great effort and out of deference to the young captain. this is a delicate moment harriman doesn't want to look incapable, but at the same time, he needs help.}
<C>__{harriman}
<D>__{captain kirk... i would appreciate any... suggestions you might have.}
<A>__{kirk is out of his chair like a cork out of a bottle. he moves down to stand next to harriman.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{first move us within transporter range and beam those people to the enterprise.}
<A>__{harriman looks at him with surprise.}
<C>__{harriman}
<D>__{what about the gravimetric distortions? they'll tear us apart...}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.}
<A>__{kirk gives him a supportive look. harriman buckles down and grimly looks at the image on the screen.}
<C>__{harriman}
<D>__{helm, close to within transporter range.}
<A>__{kirk glances at the cameraman, who's still shining the light on them all.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{and second turn that damned thing off.}
<A>__{the cameraman turns off the light.}
