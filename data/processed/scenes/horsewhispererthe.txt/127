<A>__{the women are bringing in dishes and plates and food from the tables through the house and into the kitchen. annie is among them, feeling apart of the group. she enters carrying a large bowl, that held the corn. diane is replacing newly cleaned forks and knives in her dining room drawers, above which are several family pictures.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(referring to clean bowl)}
<D>__{where does this go, diane?}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{oh, you can just set up on the dining table. i have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.}
<A>__{annie complies. she notices the framed pictures on the wall in the dining room.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{is this mr. booker? tom's grandfather?}
<A>__{diane looks at a faded photo circa late 1800's.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{mm mm. i never knew him. he died before frank and i met. this here's...}
<P>__{(another photo)}
<D>__{frank and tom's mother and father... there's little frank and tom...}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{she calls him tommy...}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{always did. i think she favored him a little. you tend to when you have more than one, even though you love 'em all the same.}
<A>__{she studies the old faces of tom's parents although 20th century people, there is still a pioneering strength in their visage... a stoicism and power.}
<C>__{diane}
<P>__{(putting away forks)}
<D>__{ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. they found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a percheron stallion. she said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i got a little confused though. the ranch ellen was talking about that's not this one?}
<A>__{diane is sorting silverware throughout the following:}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{no. see, frank and tom were raised near the clark's fork river, right between the pryor and beartooth mountains. beautiful piece of land. but they had this uncle ned useless man, never interested in ranching. and when the grandparents died, he left for the city and sent word through lawyers he wanted his claim to the land so he could sell it. three years of legation broke their father. frank took it all in stride, but tom... tom loved that land. i don't think he ever got over it his home being sold out from under him. seeing his father like that. once he and frank got their folks set up in a new place, tom left... went off. we didn't see him for years...}
<A>__{annie is intrigued by what she's learning about tom. something outside the window catches her eyes. she watches: pov; tom and frank, on either side to ellen, are escorting her to a car that will drive her home.}
