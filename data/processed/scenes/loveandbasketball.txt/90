<L>__{interior spain nightclub late night}
<A>__{a huge crowd dances fervently to the live spanish music. in the middle of the floor, the spanish players are the life of the party. in a corner, monica sits with sidra, drinking and watching the festivities. a large trophy sits on the table.}
<C>__{sidra}
<D>__{can you take that damn thing off the table.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{you mean my championship trophy? my bad.}
<A>__{monica sets it down in the seat next to her, puts an arm around it. sidra shakes her head.}
<C>__{sidra}
<D>__{still a cocky bitch.}
<A>__{monica laughs. she downs her drink, motions to the waiter.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{uno mas, por favor.}
<A>__{the waiter nods.}
<C>__{monica }
<D>__{last i heard, you were playing in sweden.}
<C>__{sidra}
<D>__{yeah, four years ago. they had me staying in this tiny ass town with like fifty people. i'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock. then the whack club i'm on loses three games in a row and i get blamed. so they fire me.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{just like that?}
<C>__{sidra}
<D>__{yup. so i've been playing with this italian club the last three years.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{how's that been?}
<C>__{sidra}
<D>__{it's better. even though the whole first season my teammates didn't pass to me cause they were mad "the american" was making more money.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i led the team in rebounds cause it was the only way i could touch the damn ball.}
<A>__{monica laughs as the waiter brings her drink. she tries to pay, but he just shakes his head, crosses away.}
<C>__{sidra }
<D>__{most of us don't win championships our first year overseas.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{please, i went through the same drama as everybody else. i mean, the first four months, only person i could talk to was this chick luisa, who knew like ten words of english from watching old "dif'rent strokes" reruns. swear to god, i had to tell her if she said, "what you talking bout, willis?" one more time, i was gonna kick her ass.}
<A>__{sidra laughs. they watch the madness out on the dance floor.}
<C>__{sidra}
<D>__{so what are these spanish guys like?}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{i wouldn't know.}
<C>__{sidra}
<D>__{what? you've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything?}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{just not my type, i guess.}
<C>__{sidra}
<D>__{shoot, italian boys love them some black women. they can't get enough of me.}
<A>__{monica smiles.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{you ever think about going back?}
<C>__{sidra}
<D>__{sometimes. but what's the alternative, not playing? you remember big toni?}
<P>__{(off monica's nod)}
<D>__{she quit last year, now she's working at some bookstore. i mean, look at us. they treat us like we're hollywood stars over here. we just played in the championship game. it doesn't get much sweeter than this.}
<A>__{monica takes this in. her eyes do not reflect someone on top of the world. she takes a long drink.}
