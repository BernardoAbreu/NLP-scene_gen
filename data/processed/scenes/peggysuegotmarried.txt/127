<D>__{does this mean you like me again?}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{it means i care about you and what happens to you.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{that's all i wanted to hear. 'cause i'm never going to give up on us. it's easy to fall apart in a crisis. it's easy to be selfish and say goodbye and good luck. but this is more than love. this is a mental decision. just wait till tomorrow, when you see your birthday present. then you'll understand.}
