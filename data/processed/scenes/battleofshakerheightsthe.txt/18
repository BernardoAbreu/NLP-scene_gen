<L>__{interior classroom day}
<A>__{the lights are off in history class. the teacher mr. norman shows slides on the civil war. the more we see the clearer it becomes that they are his own photos from a vacation spent visiting the memorials. mr. norman smiles out at his class in shot after shot. he clicks the remote and a photo of his wife, crouched over and wearing shorts, drinking from a garden hose appears on screen.}
<C>__{mr. norman}
<D>__{whoops!}
<A>__{he hurries through to the next slide. it doesn't matter anyway. everyone is almost asleep. except kelly, who becomes increasingly irritated the more mr. norman talks.}
<C>__{mr. norman}
<D>__{and here, at gettysburg, the ranks of union soldiers fought bravely on. they were willing to give their lives so that others might be free.}
<A>__{kelly shifts in his seat.}
<C>__{mr. norman}
<D>__{is there a problem mr. ernswiler?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{but mr. norman doesn't start talking again. he waits, looking at kelly, smiling blandly. until the silence becomes uncomfortable. and kelly gets mad.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{come on. isn't this analysis a tad simplistic? i mean, maybe for a second grade history class, sure but to insist on still characterizing the civil war as some moral struggle? the soldiers were drafted the only ones who had to fight were the ones who couldn't afford to pay their way out.}
<P>__{(losing it)}
<D>__{why don't you talk about the draft riots? where are your slides for that?}
