<A>__{black and white fills the frame. like a checkerboard. we pull back and realize we are seeing a group of penguins waddling against a black and white backdrop. we see a white waitre'd in a black tuxedo holding glasses on a tray. a black model, iman, in a white dress glides through it all. in the center the only dash of color is rachel who has just entered and starts expertly directing the action. she calls out to her assistant, cooper. perpetually hip. perpetually young.}

<A>__{duncan backs off, charmed by her ballsiness. the music blares just then, and a penguin juts forward and nips the model. the flash of the camera. we freeze for a second, seeing the photo rachel just took. an avedonesque portrait of a model being goosed by a penguin colliding with a maitre'd who spills his tray and the penguins seem to be pointing and laughing uproariously. it's an inspired photo.}

<D>__{i'm wondering if annabelle is responding to the underlying hostility that exists between rachel and mrs. harrison...}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{of course she's responding to it. you think it's easy for any of us? you think it's easy for jackie to watch her kids being looked after by someone who has half the experience she does? of course she's going to be hostile, irrational, and defensive.}

<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{what do you see? down that road.}
<A>__{no answer. then...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i never wanted to be a mom. then, sharing it with you was one thing. carrying it alone, the rest of my life...}

<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{don't you get it? you look down the road to her wedding. you're in the room alone with her, fitting her veil, fluffing her dress. telling her no woman was ever that beautiful.}
<A>__{tears now. standing in two pairs of eyes.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{and your fear is. she'll be thinking. i wish mom were here.}
<A>__{jackie lights her own.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{and mine is. she won't.}
<A>__{her hand trembles as she takes a drag.}

<A>__{jackie licks her lips. pretty dry. rachel takes a cotton lemon swab from the nightstand. tenderly, cleans jackie's mouth.}
