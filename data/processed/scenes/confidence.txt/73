<A>__{jake pushes lily through the back door where she finds gordo, miles and lupus waiting. her once flirtatious demeanor is replaced by something harder.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{what is this? you guys cops or something?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{we're not cops.}
<C>__{gordo}
<D>__{you gotta be kidding me. her?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{yes, her. where's my wallet?}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{your what?}
<A>__{jake takes her bag and dumps the contents on the floor a few wallets, a watch, even a wedding ring. jake picks up one of the wallets filled with cash.}
<C>__{lily }
<D>__{that's not }
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(pocketing the wallet)}
<D>__{you interested in a little work?}
<A>__{lily scoops up her bag and finds a cigarette, eyeing them all suspiciously.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{sorry about your wallet, but if you think i'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a waxed out visa and a bad fake i.d., you're fucking crazy.}
<P>__{(lighting the cigarette)}
<D>__{jake.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{take a deep breath and count to ten. it's not that kind of work. you're lily, right?}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{says who?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{you're working daffy's block. he was going to break your kneecaps. pick pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. i told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me.}
<A>__{lily takes a second to look the guys over. miles gives her a wink. lily slowly raises her middle finger at him.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{we have work. it pays a lot. unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{oooh. sassy. what do you care who feels me up, jake? unless it kinda gotcha going. did it, jake? getcha going?}
<A>__{lily saunters to jake with a seductive grin. jake may be aware that he's stopped breathing. she puts her hands on jake's chest and leans in a half inch more, her lips an eyelash away from his. she whispers...}
<C>__{lily }
<D>__{keep the wallet. we're even. take a deep breath... count to ten... and go fuck yourself.}
<A>__{lily pushes past jake and heads out of the alley.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{is it just me or is there something really hot about a girl telling you to go fuck yourself?}
<A>__{gordo gives jake a nod of approval and jake takes off after lily.}
