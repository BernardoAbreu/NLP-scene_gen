<L>__{interior night. thornfield the long gallery}
<A>__{jane holds a candle, the shawl around her; the moaning sound of a gale outside. she holds her candle up to the portrait of the voluptuous woman. she stares at it curious, both as a girl and as an artist. she brings the candle close, to see how the brushwork has achieved the effect of flesh. she hears a low, knowing laugh in the darkness behind her. she is startled.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{who's there?}
<A>__{her own huge shadow is the only thing that moves. she hears the laugh again. she follows it through the darkness, alert with fear. a door clicks shut at the end of the corridor. to her relief jane sees mrs fairfax approach with a lamp.}
<C>__{jane }
<D>__{who sleeps up here?}
<C>__{mrs fairfax}
<D>__{no one. this part of the house is quite empty, except for you and me.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i heard someone.}
<C>__{mrs fairfax}
<D>__{you can't have done.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{a laugh. someone laughed.}
<A>__{mrs fairfax flounders for a second.}
<C>__{mrs fairfax}
<D>__{oh that must be grace poole. she likes to sit up here with her sewing. rather an eccentric soul.}
<P>__{(she shouts sharply)}
<D>__{grace? grace!}
<A>__{a door opens. jane sees a broad faced woman with slow, intelligent eyes. she looks as if she has just woken up.}
<C>__{mrs fairfax }
<D>__{miss eyre has heard a laugh.}
<A>__{grace looks at jane with sly curiosity. she leaves the sewing room and opens a door through which a flight of steep steps are revealed. grace climbs them and disappears.}
