<A>__{tarr, christine, mrs. riley, the officer and "walter" stand on the porch.}
<C>__{dr. tarr}
<D>__{ and we'd appreciate it if you could make a positive identification for us.}
<C>__{mrs. riley}
<D>__{i'd be happy to. i saw the boy often. come closer, son.}
<A>__{she stoops down, studies "walter's" face, turns it from side to side. squints at him. he squints back at her. note: she's not wearing glasses. finally:}
<C>__{dr. tarr}
<D>__{take your time...be sure.}
<C>__{mrs. riley}
<D>__{oh, yes...yes...that's walter all right. used to come here all the time to play with my nephew, roger.}
<A>__{changeling a true story}
<C>__{dr. tarr}
<D>__{thank you, mrs. riley. you've been a big help, i }
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{before we go...mrs. riley, do you have the time?}
<C>__{mrs. riley}
<D>__{certainly....}
<A>__{she looks at her watch. holds it farther away. can't quite focus on it. pulls her glasses out from inside her blouse.}
<C>__{mrs. riley}
<D>__{my last concession to vanity; men don't make passes at women who wear glasses, you know.}
<P>__{(checks the watch)}
<D>__{five o'clock.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{mrs. riley nods and heads inside as christine looks to tarr, who shrugs off what was just demonstrated.}
<C>__{dr. tarr}
<D>__{a boy is much larger than a watch, mrs. collins.}
<P>__{(to "walter")}
<D>__{come along, son.}
<A>__{tarr takes "walter's" hand and heads away, christine following, anger growing in her eyes as we hear:}
<C>__{christine }
<D>__{this is absolutely outrageous!}
