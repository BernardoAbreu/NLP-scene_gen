<D>__{...you've gotta give me something to work with. freddy riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician. he can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. look. look at what the other side is gonna run at us. they got the company books, prepared by you cooked by you that's motive. they got a murder scene you had access to. that's opportunity. they got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with a dame's weapon }

<D>__{...yeah. ok. forget the jealous husband thing, that's silly; we're going with the blackmail. i will be in touch.}
<A>__{the door slams.}
<B>__{hotel lobby}
<A>__{the camera drifts in toward the reception desk. ed talks to the clerk behind the desk, but the scene plays silently; we hear only ed's narration.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{of course, there was one person who could confirm doris's story, or plenty of it: the dry cleaning pansy...}
<A>__{the desk clerk is shaking his head.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...but he'd left the hotel, skipped out on his bill...}
<B>__{hallway}
<A>__{it is a rooming house hallway. a stern middle aged woman is on the hall telephone. this too plays silently under the narration.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{he'd also disappeared from the residence he gave me...}
<A>__{ed's living room we are drifting in toward ed, who nods at the telephone and then cradles it. he stares down at the business card he holds.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...owing two month's rent. how could i have been so stupid. handing over $10,000. for a piece of paper. and the man gone... like a ghost...}
<B>__{pulling back from ed}
<A>__{in a different living room. he sits on a sofa, hands clasped behind his head, listening. for the first time, as the voice over continues, we hear atmosphere from the scene: piano music.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...disappeared into thin air, vaporized, like the nips at nagasaki. gone now. all gone. the money gone. big dave gone. doris going. how could i have been so stupid?}
<A>__{the continuing pull back reveals walter abundas on a nearby chair, also listening as birdy plays. walter holds a drink in one hand; he is nodding; his eyelids droop. as the piano piece reaches its mournful conclusion his chin alights on his chest, his eyelids tremble closed, and he starts lightly to snore.}
<B>__{barbershop}
<A>__{the distinctive buzz of electric hairclippers bangs in at the cut. ed and frank stand behind their respective chairs, administering haircuts. the customer in ed's chair is in white shirtsleeves that do not hide rolls of fat. he has a hot towel over his face that does not slow his speech, although it does muffle it to some extent:}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{she makes this stuff, she calls it gatto, it's got egg in there, it's got sugar, it's got it's cake, basically, except she calls it gatto. like if you don't call it cake maybe you won't put on any weight, like i need to eat gatto, you know what i'm saying? this stuff, if i've had a square meal, i've had my steak and potatoes, i can just have another cup of coffee afterward, i won't ask for the desert if it's not there...}
<A>__{his voice turns into a drone under the narration.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{sooner or later everyone needs a haircut...}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{got the recipe from a magazine, woman's magazine...}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{we were working for the bank now. we kept cutting the hair, trying to stay afloat, make the payments, tread water, day by day, day by day...}
<B>__{crane down}
<A>__{inside a courtroom we boom down toward the defendant's table, the fat customer's drone turning into the drone of the bailiff reading an indictment. doris stands next to freddy riedenschneider.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{most people think someone's accused of a crime, they haul 'em in and bring 'em to trial, but it's not like that, it's not that fast. the wheels of justice turn slow...}
<C>__{bailiff}
<D>__{...did willfully and with malice aforethought take the life of one david allen brewster, a human being...}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{they have an arraignment, and then the indictment, and they entertain motions to dismiss, and postpone, and change the venue, and alter this and that and the other. they empanel a jury, which brings more motions, and they set a trial date and then change the date, and then often as not they'll change it again.}
<C>__{bailiff}
<D>__{what say you to these charges?}
<A>__{our boom down has ended close on doris. we hear freddy riedenschneider, off:}
<C>__{riedenschneider}
<D>__{we plead not guilty, your honor.}
<B>__{barbershop}
<A>__{booming down toward the fat man.}
<C>__{ed }

<C>__{customer}
<D>__{i say, honey, if you're gonna make a cobbler, make a little bit of cobbler, don't put a whole pan in front of me and tell me it's not gonna be any good when it's cold...}
<B>__{opera singers}
<A>__{we are panning photographic portraits of opera singers in character, wearing the wardrobe of different eras, armies, dukedoms, and boudoirs, and displaying the heights and depths of various emotions, their mouths stretched wide in song. we pan off the pictures to discover that we are in a hotel room, floating in toward a bed on which freddy riedenschneider, a mask over his eyes, slumbers.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...meanwhile, freddy riedenschneider slept at the metropole...}

<B>__{lateral track}
<A>__{from inside a car. pedestrians bustle along a sidewalk. among them scurries a weedy little man who has one hand clamped to the crown of his hat to keep it in place in a stiff wind.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{he'd brought in a private investigator from sacramento...}
<B>__{lateral track}
<A>__{moving the opposite way. a different day, but again a crowd moves along the sidewalk, and among them the little man scuttles in the opposite direction, hand still raised to his hat, his forearm and the tilt of his head largely obscuring his face.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...to nose around into big dave's past.}
<B>__{pushing in to ed}
<A>__{in the abundas living room again, again listening to birdy at the piano, but now the two of them are alone.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{i found myself more and more going over to the abundas's. it was a routine we fell into, most every evening. i even went when walter was away on his research trips. he was a genealogist, had traced back his side of the family seven generations, his late wife's, eight. it seemed like a screwy hobby. but then maybe all hobbies are. maybe walter found something there, in the old county courthouses, hospital file rooms, city archives, property rolls, registries, something maybe like what i found listening to birdy play. some kind of escape. some kind of peace...}
<A>__{the piano music ends in a sustain which begins to fade, but then is snapped by a sharp clang.}
<B>__{prison door swings open}
<A>__{we are pushing into the high windowed prison meeting room. none of its three occupants is moving. the tableau consists of doris staring down at the table; the private investigator sitting on a straightbacked chair tipped back against a wall, his arms folded across his chest, his fedora pushed back on his head, a toothpick clamped between his teeth; and freddy riedenschneider, standing, hands clasped behind his back, gazing with a distant smile up into the shaft of light that slants through the high window. a warder shuts the door behind ed. doris and the private investigator turn to note his entrance; riedenschneider does not. ed pulls out a chair across from doris, clasps his hands on top of hers.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{'lo, honey.}
<A>__{she looks at his hands on top of hers. a long beat. still gazing up into the shaft of light, freddy riedenschneider announces:}
<C>__{riedenschneider}
<D>__{...they got this guy, in germany. fritz something or other. or is it. maybe it's werner. anyway, he's got this theory, you wanna test something, you know, scientifically how the planets go round the sun, what sunspots are made of, why the water comes out of the tap well, you gotta look at it. but sometimes, you look at it, your looking changes it. ya can't know the reality of what happened, or what would've happened if you hadden a stuck in your goddamn schnozz. so there is no 'what happened.' not in any sense that we can grasp with our puny minds. because our minds... out minds get in the way. looking at something changes it. they call it the 'uncertainty principle.' sure, it sounds screwy, but even einstein says the guy's on to something.}
<A>__{his gaze up at the window breaks. he strolls around the room, still smiling.}
<C>__{riedenschneider}
<D>__{...science. perception. reality. doubt...}
<A>__{he stops to examine a bur on his fingernail.}
<C>__{riedenschneider}
<D>__{...reasonable doubt. i'm sayin', sometimes, the more you look, the less you really know. it's a fact. a proved fact. in a way, it's the only fact there is. this heinie even wrote it out in numbers.}
<A>__{he looks up at the private detective.}
<C>__{riedenschneider}
<D>__{...burns?}
<A>__{with a slight weight shift, burns tips his chair so that its front legs slap down onto the floor. he fishes a small notebook from an inside pocket. his boredom is profound; his only concession to performance is to move the toothpick from one side of his mouth to the other where, perhaps, it will less inhibit speech.}

<C>__{riedenschneider}
<D>__{...thank you, burns, get lost.}

<A>__{ed and doris look at each other.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{...i don't get it.}
<C>__{riedenschneider}
<D>__{look, chum, this is a guy, from what i understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? island hopping, practically liberated the pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of jap guts between his teeth.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{riedenschneider}
<D>__{and now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in san diego. you asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: mr hale fellow well met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. well, it finally caught up with him these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. they called, they demanded money...}

<D>__{...did big dave mention that it was something about his war service? i don't know, i wasn't there, you'll have to tell us. maybe he specified, maybe he didn't; i'm not putting words in your mouth; the point is that this liar, this cynical manipulator, this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who did serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores, and who made a fool out of this entire town, turns to you to help him out of his jam. fat assed sonofabitch!}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{so... who... who actually }
<C>__{riedenschneider}
<D>__{who? who?! i don't know who! but the point is that if mr prosecutor over there had devoted half the time he's spent persecuting this woman to even the most cursory investigation of this schmoe's past, then we might know who! but we can't know what really happened! because of fritz, or werner, or whatever the hell his name is! and because me prosecutor is also a lazy fat assed sonofabitch who decided it's easier to victimize your wife! because it's easier not to look! because the more you look, the less you know! but the beauty of it is, we don't gotta know! we just gotta show that, goddamnit, they don't know. reasonable doubt. science. the atom. you explain it to me. go ahead. try.}
<A>__{he chuckles as he heads for the door.}
<C>__{riedenschneider}
<D>__{...yeah, freddy riedenschneider sees daylight. we got a real shot at this, folks. let's not get cocky.}
