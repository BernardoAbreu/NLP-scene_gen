<D>__{you'd better as fuck have an explanation for this, doctor.}
<A>__{loomis begins to usher tommy through the gaping crowd.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{dr. loomis, there's something you should know }
<A>__{tommy is prodded forward by loomis's .357.}
<C>__{loomis}
<D>__{i know enough already. just shut your mouth and take me to that baby.}
<A>__{they move swiftly through the gaping crowd.}
<B>__{angle on tree}
<A>__{a growing murmur of concern spreads. "where's harry?" the children are becoming impatient, and the impending storm isn't doing much to calm anyone's nerves. harry's people are at a loss to explain their star's whereabouts.}
<B>__{angle on loomis and tommy}
<A>__{on the fringes of the crowd. walking away. "oohs" and "ahhs" as the tree suddenly comes to life with thousands of orange lights. from the boughs of the tree, ropes are pulled. bunting tears open, dropping hails of candy on the shrieking kids. tommy glances back. his eyes drawn to something. grotesque and misshapen. in the tree.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{oh my god }
<B>__{angle on tree}
<A>__{kids of all ages scurry around the stage, laughing and screaming as a rainbow of candy rains down on them. diving for it. fighting over it. scooping it up in big handfuls.}

<A>__{tommy instantly breaks away and tears back through the crowd.}
<C>__{loomis}
<D>__{tommy!}
<A>__{loomis goes for him. sheriff holdt sees what is happening and flies toward them in pursuit.}
<B>__{angle on tree}
<A>__{a ballerina looks down at her white pillow case in horrified astonishment. her hands painted red as she reaches inside. all of her candy is covered with blood! the other kids back away in revulsion the entire stage begins to drip with blood! the adults don't seem to notice what is happening, more concerned with the sudden burst of pouring rain. tommy pushes his way through the crowd, screaming.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{get them out of there! get out!!!}
<A>__{sheriff holdt tries to intercept tommy just as he leaps up onto the stage, pushing kids out of the way. parents' faces register shock when they see their children running toward them, screaming hysterically, soaked with blood. loomis sees what tommy sees. words cannot convey the horror in his eyes. just then, a bolt of lightning ignites the tree. sparks flash. tiny pumpkin lights explode in a startling chain reaction. tommy helps the last of the kids off the stage when something falls from the gnarled branches: a dangling, rotating, wrapped up thing. the mutilated remains of harry simms! horrified, tommy dashes headlong off the stage. runs with loomis with the trampling crowd. struck dumb with terror, holdt looks out upon the mass destruction. the bloody corpse hanging from the tree. people running, screaming, carrying their children toward the exits.}
