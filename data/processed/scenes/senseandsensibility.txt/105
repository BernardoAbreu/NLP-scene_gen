<L>__{interior grand ballroom eve}
<A>__{the great ballroom is crammed with guests all determined to enjoy themselves despite the considerable inconveniences caused by noise, heat and overcrowding. men are sweating profusely, women dab their brows, rack punch is being swallowed by the gallon, flirting is conducted at fever pitch and all conversation is inordinately loud. only the dancers have a modicum of space in which to perform their mincing steps. mrs jennings and her brood bump into the palmers.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<P>__{(screeching)}
<D>__{this is very merry!}
<A>__{mrs jennings then spots fanny, who is conducting a desultory conversation with an overpowdered acquaintance. she drags elinor, marianne and lucy over to her.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{there you are! goodness, how hot it is, mrs dashwood. you are not alone, i trust?}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{indeed not. john is just gone to fetch my brother he has been eating ices.}
<A>__{lucy clutches at elinor's sleeve.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{your brother! i declare, that is good news indeed. at long last!}
<A>__{and she beams her approval upon elinor.}
<C>__{lucy}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{miss dashwood, i declare i shall faint clean away.}
<A>__{fanny has seen john threading his way towards them and waves at him. there is someone behind him. lucy preens. john bows to them.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{mrs jennings, may i present my brother in law?}
<A>__{he turns to reveal a good looking young man with a vacuous smile.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{mr robert ferrars!}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{my dear ladies we meet at last!}
<A>__{there is a general bowing and shaking of hands. elinor is relieved. lucy drops a low curtsy.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{so you must be the younger brother? is mr edward not here? miss dashwood here was counting on him!}
<A>__{robert looks elinor up and down. he exchanges glances with fanny before he speaks.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{oh! he is far too busy for such gatherings and has no special acquaintance here to make his attendance worthwhile.}
<A>__{mrs jennings looks at elinor in puzzlement.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{well, i declare, i do not know what the young men are about these days are they all in hiding?}
<A>__{elinor looks down, agonised with embarrassment.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{come, mr robert, in the absence of your brother, you must dance with our lovely miss dashwood!}
<C>__{robert}
<P>__{(not best pleased)}
<D>__{it would be my honour.}
<A>__{he turns to lucy and bows.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{and perhaps miss steele might consider reserving the allemande?}
<A>__{lucy curtsies again. robert escorts a most unwilling elinor onto the dance floor.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{you reside in devonshire, i b'lieve, miss dashwood?}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{we do.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{in a cottage?}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{i am excessively fond of a cottage. if i had any money to spare, i should build one myself.}
<A>__{luckily for elinor the set changes and she is obliged to turn away from robert. she wheels round to face her new partner. it is willoughby! they both stop dancing and stare at each other aghast. a traffic jam starts and they are forced to take hands and resume the steps.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<P>__{(stiff)}
<D>__{how do you do, miss dashwood?}
<A>__{elinor does not know quite how to respond.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{i am well, thank you, mr willoughby.}
<A>__{she looks about for marianne, instinctively wanting to keep her away from willoughby.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{how is your family?}
<C>__{elinor}
<P>__{(cold)}
<D>__{we are all extremely well, mr willoughby thank you for your kind inquiry.}
<A>__{willoughby is shamed into silence. then he sees marianne. at the same moment the music pauses. marianne looks up. in the brief moment of relative quiet, her great cry rings across the room.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{willoughby!}
<A>__{everyone turns to look as marianne rushes towards him with both arms outstretched, her face luminous with joy. as the noise of the room builds again and people change their partners, we are aware that many are surreptitiously watching. marianne reaches him but willoughby stands with his arms frozen at his side. marianne gives a little confused laugh.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{good god, willoughby! will you nor shake hands with me?}
<A>__{willoughby looks extremely uncomfortable and glances towards a group of very smart people who are watching him closely. central to this group is a sophisticated woman who frowns at him proprietorially. willoughby shakes marianne's hand briefly. behind her, mrs jennings is giving an animated commentary to fanny and john, while lucy whispers in robert's ear as they go past to join the set.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<P>__{(strangled)}
<D>__{how do you do, miss marianne?}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{willoughby, what is the matter? why have you not come to see me? were you not in london? have you nor received my letters?}
<A>__{willoughby is sweating with tension.}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{yes, i had the pleasure of receiving the information which you were so good as to send me.}
<C>__{marianne}
<P>__{(piteously)}
<D>__{for heaven's sake, willoughby, tell me what is wrong!}
<C>__{willoughby}
<D>__{thank you i am most obliged. if you will excuse me, i must return to my party.}
<A>__{he bows, white to the teeth, and walks away to join the}
<B>__{sophisticated woman.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{willoughby!}
<A>__{he is drawn away by his party, some of whom look back at marianne with a mixture of curiosity and condescension. marianne almost sinks to her knees. elinor supports her.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{marianne! come away!}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{go to him, elinor force him to come to me.}
<A>__{mrs jennings has come up, full of concern.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{dearest, do not betray what you feel to everyone present! this is not the place for explanations }
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{come along, dear.}
<A>__{they almost have to drag marianne away. mrs jennings turns back to the dashwood party. fanny and john have practically imploded with embarrassment and are distancing themselves as much as possible from the source. lucy and robert are dancing nearby.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{will you come, lucy?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{oh, are we leaving so soon?}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{if i might be so bold, mrs jennings, it would be our pleasure to escort your young charge home.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{how very kind!}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{that is very handsome }
<A>__{she rushes off to follow marianne and elinor. we stay for a moment with lucy and robert who have left the set.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{she actually sent him messages during the night?}
<A>__{cam rises to show the dashwoods exiting past the whispering, sneering faces of the crowd.}
