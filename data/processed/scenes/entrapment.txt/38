<A>__{mac and gin paddle kayaks, side by side. a full moon slams off the rolling surface of the sea. light chop, enough to bob pretty strong once they stop paddling. his stopwatch glows. he says only...}

<A>__{and she flips over, submerging her head and torso, and we go... ...with her underwater, upside down in the kayak, she struggles to free a group of tools which are tethered to her wetsuit. fumbling to break the seal on a slender tube, which bursts, sending a glow of yellow green light in all directions. she fits the flexible tube around her head like a headlamp, pulling out... ...a small electric fan with side handgrips of black metal. buffeted by the current, gin manages to flip a small switch on the housing of the fan, and... ...nothing happens. again. nothing. and again. shit! with a supreme effort, she tries to roll herself upright, but... ...can't quite make it. blind panic now, blowing bubbles, flailing at the kayak, which suddenly... rolls upright, manipulated by mac. she sputters and tries to throw the tethered fan at him, but it snaps back and slams her across the shoulder. she is furious.}
