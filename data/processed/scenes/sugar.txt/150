<D>__{so, um, anyway, i'm bumping sal into your slot in the rotation. i'd like to see how you handle a relief spot.}
<A>__{on the mound, salvador fires in the opening pitch. in the radio booth, jack jefferies does his play by play.}
<C>__{jack jefferies}
<D>__{moving up from relief, torres makes his third start for the swing. i tell ya, this lanky kid from the dominican republic has surprised us all with his unique delivery and precision. reminds me of a young pedro martinez... hey there bees fans, don't forget, closing night is approaching fast and tickets are selling out. so pick yours up at the box office today...}
<B>__{in the bullpen}
<A>__{similar to an earlier sequence of jumpcuts on miguel reacting to the game from the dugout, we now hold on miguel, solemn and detached, from the bullpen. note: the frame for the following images contains the first 3 4 rows of fans seated behind the bullpen, so we can also use them to gauge what might be happening on the field. play 1: miguel, the four relievers, and the fans clap for a nice play. play 2: the fans jump to their feet as a ground ball passes through frame, followed by an outfielder in hot pursuit. play 3: a reliever warms up in the foreground. miguel stares ahead, deadpan, while the others chat and spit chewing tobacco. play 4: a new reliever warms up, then runs out onto the field, leaving only two others with miguel. play 5: miguel stares ahead, while the crowd does the "chicken dance" behind him. play 6: the fans leap to their feet in applause. the two relievers high five. miguel claps, going through the motions. play 7: miguel chews and spits sunflower seed shells as the fans sing along to "take me out to the ball game." play 8: another reliever runs out onto the field, leaving only miguel and one other guy. play 9: miguel is finally warming up, ready to enter the game, but... ...the fans leap to their feet, cheering victoriously. game over. the only other reliever grabs his jacket, and heads out onto the field. as the players and fans head for the exits, miguel remains on the bullpen mound for a beat. he nods to himself, oddly at peace with the moment. miguel steps off the mound and we pan with him, as he crosses frame, and makes the long walk to the dugout. hold.}
