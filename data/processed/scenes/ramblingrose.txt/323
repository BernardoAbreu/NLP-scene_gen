<L>__{interior hillyer home kitchen day}
<A>__{a shot of mother and rose and the children in the kitchen. we see a sewing machine and evidences of dressmaking. rose has on a new and modest little dress that mother evidently has made for her.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{you see, rose? now that's the kind of dress you ought to wear.}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(less than enthusiastic)}
<D>__{yeah, it's kinda nice.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{you look very pretty in it, rose. really, you do.}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(smiles at mother)}
<D>__{well, you're real sweet to make it for me.}
<P>__{(puts an arm around mother's shoulder)}
<D>__{there never was nobody like you. and you don't need to worry, i ain't goin' out no more.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, rose... in moderation.}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(a little shrug)}
<D>__{i don't want to. when i was lyin' there in that hospital bed at death's door i says to myself, i ain't goin' out no more. if i ever get outta this, i will just stay home.}
<A>__{rose casually pulls the dress over her head and stands there in panties and bra, oblivious of buddy and the children. she has about as much modesty as a small child herself.}
<C>__{rose }
<P>__{(rather sadly)}
<D>__{besides, there ain't no mr. right out there. or if there is i can't find him, all i find is a pile of mr. wrongs. i ain't goin' out no more.}
