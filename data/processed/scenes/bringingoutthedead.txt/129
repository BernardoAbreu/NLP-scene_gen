<A>__{frank walking out of the restroom wiping water off his face, looking at the gurney where coates lies on his side, metal spike still sticking through his hip, iv line running to his arm, eyes closed. nurses walk past coates: he's stabilized, waiting his turn. cy, take a number. frank spots hazmat at burke's cubicle, walks over.}
<C>__{hazmat}
<D>__{nurse crupp, we're going to need some valium here. he's waking up again.}
<A>__{the ventilator alarm goes off as burke pulls at his restraints.}
<C>__{hazmat }
<P>__{(urgent)}
<D>__{where's that valium?}
<A>__{nurse crupp walks briskly over, injects needle into one of burke's iv bags. burke's voice speaks in frank's head:}
<C>__{burke's voice}
<D>__{don't. don't do it.}
<C>__{hazmat}
<D>__{give me a hand, frank. i've got to get something between those teeth.}
<A>__{frank helps hazmat force in a bite stick. the monitor alarm cuts off, the ventilator starts up again, pumping air in, pulling air out.}
<C>__{hazmat }
<D>__{you can't believe how much he's improved.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{how many times have you shocked him tonight?}
<C>__{hazmat}
<D>__{fourteen. we finally got him a room upstairs. should be up there in a couple of hours.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?}
<C>__{hazmat}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{that's good, frank. no, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. it goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. it sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. amazing, isn't it?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{a medical miracle.}
