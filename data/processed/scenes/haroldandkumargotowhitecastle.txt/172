<B>__{harold takes a deep breath and then knocks on the door...}
<A>__{there is tension as harold waits. then, finally, the door knob begins to turn and the door opens a good looking, muscular hispanic man (luis) is standing}
<B>__{behind the door wearing only his boxers. he has lipstick all over his neck and chest...}
<C>__{luis}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<A>__{a look of extreme disappointment goes over harold's face.}

<P>__{(to harold, laughing)}
<D>__{this girl is crazy, man.}
<C>__{luis }
<D>__{she seemed so sweet at first, but it turns out she's into some pretty freaky shit. she even did this thing where she took a lollipop and shoved it...}
<C>__{harold}
<P>__{(grossed out depressed)}
<D>__{look, i really don't need to hear it. i guess i just made a mistake. sorry for interrupting you guys...}
<A>__{harold starts to walk away, almost crying. sad, depressing music begins to play. kumar feels sorry for his friend. just then, luis leans his head out the door...}
<C>__{luis}
<D>__{hey if you're looking for maria, she left for europe this morning.}
<A>__{harold quickly turns around and runs back over.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{luis}

<C>__{luis}
<D>__{you must be that chinese guy maria keeps talking about.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{actually, i'm kor...wait a second she talks about me?}

<D>__{are you coming or what?}
<C>__{luis}
<D>__{hey, i will be there in a second, baby. do me a favor make me that omelette you were talking about. you know, with the sun dried tomatoes.}
<A>__{aisha kisses him, and walks away to the kitchen. luis gives her a little a slap on the ass. harold doesn't quite know how to respond to this.}
<C>__{luis}
<P>__{(to harold)}
<D>__{so you want me to leave her a message or something?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{uh, no thanks. i'd rather do it in person.}
<C>__{luis}
<D>__{then take it easy, hermano.}
<A>__{luis shuts the door. kumar runs over to harold...}

<D>__{dude...we gotta go!}

<D>__{to amsterdam! we can pack up right now and take the next plane.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{what are you talking about? are you out of your mind? what about your interview with the med school guy?}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{whatever. i will tell my dad to reschedule it. he won't have a problem, as long as i'm taking it seriously for a change. now, let's fly to europe and find maria!}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{she's coming back in ten days! it's not like i'm never gonna see her again.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{for a hot chick, ten days in europe is the kiss of death. there are gonna be suave, sophisticated guys all over her. by the time she gets back, she may not be available.}
<A>__{harold feels a little nervous about what kumar is saying.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{forget it. i will just wait till she comes back.}
<A>__{harold starts to walk away from kumar...}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{hey, rold! wait!}
<A>__{harold stops.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{you do realize what's legal in amsterdam, right?}
<B>__{harold turns around. kumar has a big smile on his face.}
<A>__{slowly, but surely, harold starts to smile as well.}
