<A>__{a busy street crowded with pedestrians, open shops, and produce stalls. carnby's taxi races down the busy market street, followed by pinkerton. they swerve and screech down the street, cutting off other cars, and narrowly avoiding pedestrians. but then pinkerton's taxi zooms up beside carnby's taxi and bumps into it with a grinding crush of metal. not stopping, pinkerton's taxi continues to grind into carnby's taxi. the momentum pushes carnby's taxi around sideways. pinkerton's taxi then slams carnby's sideways taxi into a parked car with a crush of metal and shattering glass. there's a moment as carnby, trapped inside the crushed taxi and pinkerton, flooring the accelerator to add more pressure, exchange a look. pinkerton's expression is fierce. pinkerton gears the taxi into reverse, backing up in order to smash into carnby's taxi again. the cabbie is trapped by the crushed front of the taxi. his face is covered with a spiderweb of deep cuts. the cabbie struggles to get loose.}

<A>__{as pinkerton's taxi backs up, it crashes into a van driving by, knocking it over onto its side and spilling the contents of the van onto the street. this gives carnby the brief moment he needs to extract himself from the crushed taxi. he wrenches himself out the window, just in time to see pinkerton's taxi accelerating towards him. carnby bolts away from the crushed taxi and the trapped cabbie. pinkerton immediately swerves his taxi, aiming it right for the running carnby. pinkerton's taxi rockets towards him. carnby leaps out of the way as pinkerton's taxi crashes into the side of a building, narrowly missing him. pinkerton's taxi is crumpled in a crash of metal and glass. carnby narrowly avoids being crushed between the taxi and the building. with fluid grace, carnby rolls to safety, landing on his feet. with a quick look back over his shoulder at pinkerton in his crumpled taxi, carnby runs. pinkerton steps out of his taxi, seemingly unhurt by the crash. he looks around, but can't see carnby anywhere on the street. pinkerton runs for an iron wrought staircase that leads up to a pedestrian bridge that hangs over the street. at the top of the pedestrian bridge, pinkerton looks up and down the street. he spots carnby, running through the crowd of pedestrians. pinkerton leaps off the pedestrian bridge, arcing through the air with superhuman force. pinkerton tackles the running carnby to the ground, slamming into him with a tremendous impact. but carnby is quick. he takes the hit and spins pinkerton around with a martial arts kick. the kick sends pinkerton crashing through the front window of a bakery.}
