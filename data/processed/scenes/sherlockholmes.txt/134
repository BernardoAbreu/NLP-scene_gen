<L>__{101 interior punch bowl pub}
<A>__{the music stops. irene and watson notice the silence. they swap a glance. a beat. and holmes emerges.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i need a map of london.}
<L>__{interior punch bowl pub attic}
<A>__{holmes is excited, electric.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{now that you're sitting comfortably, i shall begin. my initial approach was far too narrow. when blackwood invited me to pentonville prison, he suggested i widen my gaze and, at minimum, i have done just that. in fact, i may well have reconciled thousands of years of theological disparity. but that's for another time. blackwood's method is based on a ritualistic mystical system that has been employed by the temple of the four orders for centuries. to fully understand this system, to get inside it, i re enacted the ceremony we interrupted in the crypt... with a few enhancements of my own.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{at minimum.}
<A>__{watson and irene shoot holmes knowing looks.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{my journey took me somewhat further down the rabbit hole than i had intended.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{yes, your little white tail got rather dirty.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{but i have emerged enlightened... the fraternity who silently control the empire, share the belief with the kings, pharoahs, and emperors of old that the sphinx was a door to another dimension, a gateway to immeasurable power }
<A>__{he tosses watson the pages from sir thomas.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{it is made up of four parts: the ox, the lion, the eagle, and man }
<A>__{he points out the individual parts of the sphinx, covering other parts with his hand. we see the ox body, lion paws, eagle wings, man's face.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{in sir thomas' secret chamber i found the bone of an ox, the tooth of a lion, the feather of an eagle, the hair of a man. map!}
<A>__{watson throws the map down on the floor, really flying now.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{now, it is a widely held belief that within the architecture of the great cities are coded references to this system.}
<A>__{he runs his finger over the map tracing the shape of a cross... then he picks up the charcoal and (following the map) draws a serpentine curve of the river thames straight through the middle of the cross that he drew on the floor.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{since he rose from the grave, blackwood has killed three men. each murder was committed at a location that has a direct connection with the temple, therefore the system.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{reordon, the ginger midget, represents man. we found his body here...}
<A>__{he points to a spot on the map south of the thames. it corresponds to the point on the cross that holmes drew that has the hair (6 o'clock).}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{then sir thomas, master of the temple, wore the ox ring... he died here...}
<A>__{again the spot holmes points is directly north of the river and corresponds to the point on the cross that has the ox bone (12 o'clock).}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{standish was ambassador to america, where the eagle has been the national emblem for over a hundred years and not by coincidence.}
<A>__{holmes points to the map.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{the headquarters of temple of the four orders where he died is here...}
<A>__{he points to corresponding points on the map and on the cross.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{man, ox, eagle...}
<A>__{he connects the dots on the map. they form three points of a cross.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{and last on the list: the lion.}
<A>__{holmes scribbles on a piece of paper. watson and irene step closer looking at the lion's fang and then the map...}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{correspondingly, the map will tell us the location of blackwood's final act. right here.}
<A>__{their eyes widen as they realize what they're seeing.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{parliament.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{what is the meaning of this circle?}
<A>__{irene indicates the fifth circle holmes has drawn the point at which the other four come together. they look to where it would correspond to on the map right in the middle of the river.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{it is the fifth element the ethereal. that which can't yet be known.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{it's right in the middle of the river thames.}
<A>__{boom! they hear doors slamming outside, boots echoing. irene looks out the window, sees police officers flooding the pub.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{police.}
<A>__{holmes folds up his piece of paper, hands it to watson. he quickly moves to a hatch in the floor. flings it open.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{ladies first.}
<A>__{irene jumps down. watson is about to follow her down.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{follow these plans.}
<A>__{watson goes down. it looks as though holmes is about to join them when lestrade and his men burst into the room. holmes kicks the hatch closed and steps towards lestrade.}
