<A>__{as prew and warden enter. maggio is sweeping the room. mazzioli, a bespectacled, intellectual looking private first class, is at the clerk's desk, opening it, taking out papers, etc. prew sits on a bench as warden goes over to mazzioli.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{mazzioli! grant went to the hospital yesterday. did you make up his sick record? did you make a note for the morning report?! you're the compny clerk. the lousy sickbook is your job!}
