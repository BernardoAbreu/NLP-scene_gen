<A>__{he hits weir again. hard. blood gushes from weir's skull, filling the runes on his face. weir staggers. miller attacks. again and again and again... this time weir is ready. he catches the scrubber and tears it from miller's grasp. smashes miller to the floor with a single blow. miller groans.}
