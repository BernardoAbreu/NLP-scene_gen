<C>__{astrophysicist}
<D>__{wake up, cole.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{uh, i didn't hear the...}
<C>__{microbiologist}
<P>__{(tapping a pencil on the table)}
<D>__{i asked you, why did you volunteer?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{well, the guard woke me up. he told me i volunteered.}
<A>__{the scientists react, whispering urgently among themselves. cole starts to nod off again, then comes awake with a start as the engineer speaks to him.}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{we appreciate you volunteering. you're a very good observer, cole.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{uh, thank you.}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{you'll get a reduction in sentence.}
<A>__{cole keeps his face impassive.}
<C>__{astrophysicist}
<D>__{to be determined by the proper authorities.}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{you don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, cole? have it taken away?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{no, sir!}
<C>__{astrophysicist}
<D>__{we have a very advanced program, something very different, requires very skilled people.}
<C>__{microbiologist}
<D>__{an opportunity to reduce your sentence considerably...}
<C>__{zoologist}
<D>__{and possibly play an important role in returning the human race to the surface of the earth.}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{we want tough minded people. strong mentally. we've had some...misfortunes with "unstable" types.}
<C>__{astrophysicist}
<D>__{for a man in your position...an opportunity.}
<C>__{botanist}
<D>__{not to volunteer could be a real mistake.}
<C>__{microbiologist}
<P>__{(tapping his pencil again)}
<D>__{definitely a mistake!}
<A>__{cole gives away nothing. he's in a box here. he has no choices. he stares at the tapping pencil.}
