<L>__{interior seymour's bedroom later that night}
<A>__{enid & seymour sit on the bed listening to old records and drinking out of the bottle.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{you need a bigger place this is like a little kid's room.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{i could never move i've got too much stuff.}
<A>__{enid notices an extremely ugly modern sculpture in the corner. she goes over and picks it up.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{where did you get this?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{dana bought it when we went antique shopping. she said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs."}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{jesus, how can you stand her?}
<A>__{seymour takes another slug off the bottle.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{god, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half empty!}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{that's great! "half empty" that's what i like about you, seymour, you're a natural pessimist!}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{if you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{what are you talking about? you're disappointed every minute of your life.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{i'm just being realistic.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{at least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{i hate sports.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{how come in all that time i was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{you're a beautiful young girl... i can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{i mean... of course i... why wouldn't i want to go out with you?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{i dunno... i always feel like everybody secretly hates me. i'm just paranoid i guess. i mean, you like me don't you? we're good friends, right?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{yeah, sure. of course.}
<C>__{enid}
<P>__{(contemplative pause)}
<D>__{...maybe i should just move in here with you... i could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until i get a job.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{what about joe?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{oh yeah... and dana...}
<P>__{(says her name with}
<D>__{whiny, disdainful}
<P>__{voice)}
<D>__{you were a lot more fun before you met dana. you've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked up guy, seymour, that's why i like you.}
<C>__{seymour}
<P>__{(more drunk than before)}
<D>__{yeah, well i like you too...}
<B>__{ten minutes later}
<A>__{the bottle is empty.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{you know what my number one fantasy used to be?}
<C>__{seymour}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{i used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... do you ever think about stuff like that?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{i guess i probably used to when i was your age.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{it would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and i'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{you know what we should do? let's go get in your car right now and just take off! we could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{i don't think i'm in any condition to drive.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{i will drive, then we'll go out in a blaze of glory!}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{so where would we go?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{who cares? let's just go... what's stopping us?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{i dunno, i...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{i'm serious! i'm just so sick of everybody! why can't i just do whatever i want?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{i i i...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{what's the matter with you, seymour? don't you like me? be a man for once in your life!}
<A>__{she kisses him passionately. he's shocked but kisses back. this escalates, leading to the sex act, shown with merciful brevity. we see enid & seymour, post coital.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{god, dana's going to kill you!}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{...do you really want us to drive away somewhere?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{what?... maybe... no... i dunno...}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{i will if you want to.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{no... forget it...}
<C>__{seymour}
<P>__{(embarrassingly sappy)}
<D>__{i i never expected anything like this to happen...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{yeah, well... me neither...}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{you must know i always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{i was just thinking out loud...}
<P>__{(doesn't want to hurt his feelings)}
<D>__{i mean, you've got this whole thing with dana i'm not going to let you fuck that up...}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{but, i...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{shhh... i really need to get some sleep.}
<A>__{enid turns her back to him. we see from reverse angle that she's only pretending to be asleep. she looks troubled, as though she's just made a big mistake. seymour puts his arm around her. it's the only time we've seen him look relaxed and happy.}
<C>__{seymour}
<D>__{good night...}
<A>__{he kisses her arm and goes to sleep.}
