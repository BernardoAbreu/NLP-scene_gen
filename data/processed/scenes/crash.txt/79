<A>__{james and the crippled gabrielle visit the annual auto show, which occupies the immense halls of the airport convention center. he watches appreciatively as she swings herself on her shackled legs among the hundreds of cars displayed on their stands. gabrielle approaches the imposing mercedes stand and, pivoting about on her heels, seems to take immense pleasure from these immaculate vehicles, placing her scarred hands on their paintwork, rolling her injured hips against them like an unpleasant cat. she soon draws the attention of a young salesman, who tries hard not to notice her scars and braces.}

<D>__{the white sports model. could you help me into it, please? i'd like to see if i can fit into a car designed for a normal body.}
<A>__{both james and gabrielle enjoy the salesman's discomfort as he helps her into the mercedes sports car. she does her best to make it difficult, deliberately snagging her leg brace clips on the soft leather of the driver's side armrest, forcing him to unhook her and to touch her deformed thighs and knees while manipulating her legs into the footwell.}
