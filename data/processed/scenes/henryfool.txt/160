<C>__{airline rep}
<D>__{this way, mr grim! this way!}
<A>__{runway technicians rush to their positions, but henry hangs back and struggles across the tarmac, looking back over his shoulder at... simon, behind the huge plate glass window of the terminal. he stops and waits. simon raises his hand in farewell and... henry raises his in reply. then simon, unheard behind the gigantic glass wall, silent amongst the roar of the runway, says...}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(unheard)}
<D>__{run.}
<A>__{and henry understands. he lowers his hand, waits just a moment, then turns and looks out at... the airplane. the airline representative is shouting at him from the foot of the stairs and waving him on with her walkie talkie. he glances back once more at simon. then... henry is running, struggling towards us, forcing himself towards the plane, getting stronger and running faster with every step he takes.}
