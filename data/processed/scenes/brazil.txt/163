<A>__{sam enters the flat. jill is nowhere to be seen. the lights are out but, from the partially opened bedroom door beams a shaft of bright light. music pours forth ... it is "brazil".}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(cautiously)}
<D>__{jill?}
<A>__{getting no answer he goes to the door and peers through. there is jill but, transformed. she is wearing one of sam's mother's wigs which billows in the air blown by a fan. she is also wearing a diaphanous nightdress borrowed from the extensive wardrobe and is dancing slowly. she looks like the dream girl. sam stands open mouthed. jill notices him and smiles.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{what do you think? ... is it me?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(still stunned)}
<D>__{you don't exist any more. i've killed you. jill layton is dead.}
<A>__{he holds out a print out. she reads it and slowly looks up.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{care for a bit of necrophilia?}
<A>__{they rush together.}
