<L>__{exterior deep space}
<A>__{a black void shot with stars, far from any sun. a sturdy prospecting ship forges through space, travel worn but built to last. it carries the weyland industries logo. the name painted on its hull is magellan.}
<L>__{interior magellan bridge}
<A>__{the ship's nerve center and control room. six control stations, empty and quiet. interior lights dimmed to blue. the entire forward bulkhead of the bridge is a window: wall to wall, floor to ceiling. at the window stands the android david. he gazes at the cosmos with an expression of utter serenity. after a long moment he turns away. massive shutters close over the window as he walks off.}
<C>__{corridor}
<A>__{david walks the ship's long central corridor. the ship is silent. the lights dimmed to blue. he is alone.}
<C>__{hypersleep compartment}
<A>__{a long steel room containing a dozen plexiglass sarcophagi, six on each side. sleep freezers. inside each freezer: the shadowy shape of a human body rimed with frost. david walks through the compartment, surveying the sleepers.}
<C>__{workroom}
<A>__{david sits at a display table, moving intricate technical documents across the surface with waves of his hands. his eyes intent on his work. if he is reading, then he`s reading at a speed no human could match.}
<C>__{white landscape}
<A>__{we pull away from the frosted crystalline horizon, the smooth white curves like snowy fields. form becomes clear. it's the body of a woman. it's watts.}
