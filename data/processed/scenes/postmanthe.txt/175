<A>__{fog rolls in. abby rests. ponytail, chubby and drew look up gratefully as one of the citizens of bridge city doles out bread. the mayor steps over, hands the postman two loaves.}
<C>__{b.c. mayor}
<D>__{for you and your wife.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{thanks. she's not my wife.}
<A>__{the exchange cuts abby like a knife. she gets up and leaves. the mayor keeps his council not sure what to make of this arrangement.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{let me ask you something, have you ever heard of a town with electric lights?}
<C>__{b.c. mayor}
<D>__{st. rose?}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{yeah!}
<C>__{b.c. mayor}

<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{how far?}
<C>__{b.c. mayor}
<D>__{couple hundred miles at least. i couldn't say for sure.}
<A>__{it's the discovery of a lifetime. the postman looks to the west end of the bridge, where abby stands alone.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{you seem like a decent man. and these seem like decent people.}
<C>__{b.c. mayor}
<D>__{we try to be.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{and this seems like a safe place.}
<C>__{b.c. mayor}
<P>__{(intuitive)}
<D>__{you want to leave her?}
<A>__{the postman looks back to the mayor, then slowly nods.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{all of them. i will give you the horses and my gear. abby's special. she's strong. probably end up running the place.}
<C>__{b.c. mayor}
<D>__{why don't you take the night to think. decide if that's what you really want.}
