<L>__{interior hospital corridor. day}
<A>__{overhead fluorescent lights flash by, as we observe the ceiling from mark's point of view. we also hear the sound of rapidly rolling rubber wheels, and a voice.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{mark, can you hear me? open your eyes.}
<L>__{interior hospital. day}
<A>__{mark is in a regular hospital bed, with a temporary plastic cocoon over him in place of his iron lung. there is a volunteer called susan in the room with him.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{they'll be letting you go today. whoever looks after you will leave the portable respirator switched on at night, fully charged, so you'll have at least one back up system.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{how close was i?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{to what?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you know, to that tunnel thing and the light, and the voice saying don't go near the light.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{is that what you remember?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{no. i assume i passed out. before that, i remember feeling sorry for myself.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{do you feel relieved now?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{no. i mean, i'm relieved that rod got to me in time, but i still feel sorry for myself.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i'm sure there's a cure for that. would you like to talk to someone?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i feel comfortable talking to you.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i'm only a volunteer, not a therapist. i can refer you to someone if you like.}
<A>__{mark breaks into a broad smile, then a chuckle.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i don't mean to be rude. i'm just smiling at the idea that a therapist could do anything useful for me right now. my priest couldn't.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{are you religious?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yes. i would find it absolutely intolerable not to be able to blame someone for all this. are you?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{no, i don't go to any church and i don't think about god very much. but i believe there's a mysterious logic, or poetry to life. i guess that makes me a spiritual type.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yes, that would count.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{would you like me to visit you?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{are you married?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{do you have a steady boyfriend?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{then please visit as often as you can.}
