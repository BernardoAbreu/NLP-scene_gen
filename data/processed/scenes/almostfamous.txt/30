<L>__{interior backstage steps night minutes later}
<A>__{william sits on the backstage steps, writing feverishly in his notebook. behind him, two steps higher, penny lane scoots into place.}
<C>__{penny lane}
<D>__{i found you a pass.}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(amped, distracted)}
<D>__{thanks. i got in with stillwater.}
<P>__{(as he writes)}
<D>__{the guitarist, russel hammond, he just thoroughly opened up. he is by far the best and most honest interview i've ever done.}
<P>__{(she nods)}
<D>__{i've only done two, but you know. he's number one.}
<C>__{penny lane}
<D>__{you're learning. they're much more fun on the way up.}
<A>__{william nods, still scribbling. she eases down into place on the step next to him. her proximity cause him to look at her, his eyebrows rising. she smooths them down with two single fingers.}
<C>__{penny lane }
<D>__{how old are you?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{eighteen.}
<C>__{penny lane}
<D>__{me too.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{how old are we really?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{seventeen.}
<C>__{penny lane}
<D>__{me too.}

<D>__{actually i'm 16.}
<C>__{penny lane}
<D>__{me too. isn't it funny?}
<A>__{the truth}
<D>__{just sounds different.}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(confesses)}
<D>__{i'm 15.}
<C>__{penny lane}
<D>__{you want to know how old i really am?}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(immediately)}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{she looks upstairs, soaking in the sound of another band tuning up. music is her religion.}
<C>__{william }
<D>__{how did you get started in all this?}
<C>__{penny lane}
<D>__{it's a long story.}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(quick study)}
<D>__{right. right.}
<C>__{penny lane}
<D>__{we live in the same city. we should be friends.}
<A>__{she takes his backstage pass form his shirt and puts it on his thigh the cooler location. nearby, the dressing room door opens, and the stillwater exits. excitement level rises as they mass in the hallway with instruments. we hear the amped voice of russell growing nearer.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{the enemy!}
<A>__{he approaches, as william stands. penny watches, hanging out of russell's eyesight. standing in the supercharged hallway, the kid is anxious to introduce his new friends.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{russell, this is penny lane.}
<C>__{penny lane}
<P>__{(stepping into view)}
<D>__{pleasure.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{penny lane? like the song, right?}
<C>__{penny lane}
<D>__{have we met?}
<B>__{they shake}
<A>__{and do not let go, for too long. there is history in their shake. their eyes tell all. shot takes us to william, who puts two and two together. it isn't hard. they clearly know each other. well.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{well, i guess you've... you've met.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{penny lane! god's gift to rock and roll!! you're back!}
<P>__{(privately)}
<D>__{marc bolan. please.}
<A>__{other band members pass, adjusting clothes for show time, waiting in the hallway... and now singing the beatles song "penny lane."}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{come on, let's go.}
<P>__{(noting kid's shyness)}
<D>__{both of you.}
