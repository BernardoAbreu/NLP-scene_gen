<C>__{aisha}
<D>__{so, what really happened to you in afghanistan?}
<A>__{clay looks over at her. down at the teddy bear tattoo... and shakes his head.}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{that's not for you.}
<A>__{she traces her fingers over it...}
<C>__{clay }
<D>__{why do you want max dead?}
<A>__{aisha, taken aback by the suddenness of the question.}
<C>__{aisha}
<D>__{he's a bad man. isn't that enough?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{a beat. she looks at him.}
<C>__{aisha}
<D>__{when you tell me about afghanistan? i will tell you about max.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{fine. it's hot. there's lots of sand. your turn.}
<A>__{aisha smiles at this. shaking her head.}
<C>__{aisha}
<D>__{why were you alone when i found you?}
<A>__{that takes clay off guard. looking out at the city.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{the guys got sick of it.}
<C>__{aisha}
<D>__{sick of what?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{of hearing about max. of hearing me say we had to do something when there wasn't anything to do. they wanted to be around their families. jensen has a sister. pooch has a wife and daughters.}
<C>__{aisha}
<D>__{and he hasn't told them he is alive?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{would you? the people you loved the most, would you put them in that kind of danger?}
<A>__{aisha, side stepping the question:}
<C>__{aisha}
<D>__{so roque has no one.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{he's got me.}
<C>__{aisha}
<D>__{and you have...}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{enough hate to get us both through the day. he stuck with me when no one else would. and i ain't the easiest guy to stick with.}
<A>__{aisha studies him.}
<C>__{aisha}
<D>__{if you two really fought, he would kill you, i think.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you think.}
<C>__{aisha}
<D>__{i'm almost sure of it.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{aisha}
<D>__{because you care what happens to the others. you wouldn't put them at risk to save yourself.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{and you think that's a weakness.}
<C>__{aisha}
<D>__{i know it is. law of the jungle.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{we're not in the jungle.}
<A>__{she looks at him.}
<C>__{aisha}
<D>__{oh, yes we are...}
