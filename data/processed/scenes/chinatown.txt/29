<L>__{interior brown derby close on newspaper}
<A>__{gittes is seated, flips through the paper until he finds the obituary column, scans it, looks up, abruptly tears the column from the paper and puts it in his pocket. when he closes the paper we can see headlines in the left hand column: "water bond issue passes council". ten million dollar referendum to go before the public. evelyn mulwray is standing at the table as he does so. he rises, allows her to sit.}
<B>__{close on evelyn}
<A>__{gittes watches her as she removes her gloves slowly... she's wearing dove gray gabardine, subdued, tailored.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{thanks for coming... drink?}
<A>__{the waiter's appeared. evelyn is looking at gittes' nose.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{tom collins with lime, not lemon, please.}
<A>__{evelyn looks down and smoothes her gloves. when she looks back up she stares expectantly at gittes. gittes pulls out a torn envelope. the initials ecm can be seen in a delicate scroll on the corner of it.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{i got your check in the mall.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{yes. as i said, i was very grateful.}
<A>__{gittes' fingers the envelope. he coughs.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{mrs. mulwray, i'm afraid that's not good enough.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<P>__{(a little embarrassed)}
<D>__{well, how much would you like?}
<B>__{close on evelyn}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{stop it. the money's fine. it's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<P>__{(coolly)}
<D>__{i have?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{i think so. something besides your husband's death was bothering you. you were upset but not that upset.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{mr. gittes...}
<P>__{(icily)}
<D>__{don't tell me how i feel.}
<A>__{the drinks come. the waiter sets them down.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{sorry. look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. excuse me. then you ask me to lie to the police.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{it wasn't much of a lie.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{if your husband was killed it was.}
<P>__{(meaning check)}
<D>__{this can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{but he wasn't killed.}
<A>__{gittes smiles.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{i think you're hiding something, mrs. mulwray.}
<A>__{evelyn remains unperturbed.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{well, i suppose i am... actually i knew about the affair.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{how did you find out?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{my husband.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{he told you?}
<A>__{evelyn nods.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{and you weren't the slightest bit upset about it?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{i was grateful.}
<A>__{evelyn for the first time appears a little embarrassed.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{you'll have to explain that, mrs. mulwray.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(a flash of annoyance)}
<D>__{look, i do matrimonial work, it's my metiay. when a wife tells me she's happy her husband is cheating on her it runs contrary to my experience.}
<A>__{gittes looks significantly to evelyn.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{unless what?}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(looking directly at her)}
<D>__{she's cheating on him.}
<A>__{evelyn doesn't reply.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{were you?}
<A>__{evelyn is clearly angry but she is controlling it.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{i don't like the word 'cheat.'}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{did you have affairs?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<P>__{(flashing)}
<D>__{mr. gittes.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{did he know?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<P>__{(almost an outburst)}
<D>__{well i wouldn't run home and tell him whenever i went to bed with someone, if that's what you mean.}
<A>__{this subdues gittes a little. evelyn is still a little heated.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<P>__{(continuing; more calmly)}
<D>__{is there anything else you want to know?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{where you were when your husband died.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{i can't tell you.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{you mean you don't know where you were?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{i mean i can't tell you.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{you were seeing someone, too.}
<A>__{evelyn looks squarely at him. she doesn't deny it.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{for very long?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{i don't see anyone for very long, mr. gittes. it's difficult for me. now i think you know all you need to about me. i didn't want publicity. i didn't want to go into any of this, then or now. is this all?}
<A>__{gittes nods.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{oh, by the way. what's the 'c' stand for?}
<A>__{he's been fingering the envelope...}
<C>__{evelyn}
<P>__{(she stammers slightly)}
<D>__{k... cross.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{that your maiden name?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{yes... why?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{no reason.}
<A>__{evelyn turns into gittes.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{you must've had a reason to ask me that.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{no. i'm just a snoop.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{you seem to have had a reason for every other question.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{no, not for that one.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{i don't believe you.}
<A>__{gittes suddenly turns sharply in to evelyn.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(moving in)}
<D>__{do me a favor. sit still and act like i'm charming.}
<A>__{evelyn involuntarily draws back.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{there's somebody here. say something. anything. something like we're being intimate.}
<A>__{evelyn reluctantly allows gittes to move closer and dangle his hand in front of their faces. she stares at him.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<P>__{(meaning his nose)}
<D>__{how did it happen?}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{been meaning to talk to you about that.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{maybe putting your nose in other people's business?}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{more like other people putting their business in my nose.}
<A>__{evelyn actually smiles a little.}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{you son of a bitch.}
<A>__{gittes looks up and flashes his smile.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{mrs. match. how're you?}
<A>__{mrs. match is swaying over the table, a plump woman with a glass of whiskey in one hand, a large purse in the other, and a menacing look in her eye.}
<C>__{mrs. match}
<D>__{don't give me that, you son of a bitch.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{gittes turns back to evelyn.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{another satisfied client?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{another satisfied client's wife.}
<C>__{mrs. match}
<D>__{look at me, you son of a bitch. you... you bastard. are you happy, are you happy now?}
<A>__{she tries to take a swipe at gittes with her purse. gittes covers himself. waiters rush over.}
<C>__{mrs. match}
<D>__{you smug son of a bitch. my husband's so upset he sweats all night! how do you think that makes me feel?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{sweaty?}
<A>__{mrs. match swings at gittes again and again. she catches him on the nose. it hurts. he covers it, then swings his leg out from under the table and deftly kicks her in the shin. mrs. match drops her purse and spills her drink. she grabs her shin, hopping around a little. the waiters who had tried to restrain her now try to keep her from falling over.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{let's get out of here before she picks up her purse.}
<A>__{they rise and move toward the door.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{tough guy, huh?}
<A>__{gittes looks, sees she's kidding, and nods.}
<B>__{outside in the parking lot dusk}
<A>__{gittes' car has been brought by the parking attendant. the attendant opens the passenger side for evelyn.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{oh, no. i've got my own car. the creamcolored packard.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(to attendant who}
<D>__{dutifully starts for}
<P>__{her car)}
<D>__{wait a minute, sonny.}
<P>__{(to evelyn)}
<D>__{i think you better come with me.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{what for? there's nothing more to say.}
<P>__{(to attendant)}
<D>__{get my car, please.}
<A>__{the attendant starts after it again. gittes leans on the open door of his car and in to evelyn. he talks quietly but spits it out.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{okay, go home. but in case you're interested your husband was murdered. somebody's dumping tons of water out of the city reservoirs when we're supposedly in the middle of a drought, he found out, and he was killed. there's a waterlogged drunk in the morgue. involuntary manslaughter if anybody wants to take the trouble which they don't. it looks like half the city is trying to cover it all up, which is fine with me. but, mrs. mulwray.}
<P>__{(now inches from her)}
<D>__{i goddam near lost my nose! and i like it. i like breathing through it. and i still think you're hiding something.}
<A>__{evelyn steadies herself on the open car door. she stares at gittes for a long moment. then he gently tugs the car door closed.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{mr. gittes.}
<A>__{he drives off into the wilshire traffic, leaving evelyn looking after him.}
