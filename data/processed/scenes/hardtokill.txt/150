<A>__{nolan comes around the end of the car, sees o'malley standing over the dead turner with a tire iron in his hand. it is clear o'malley is about to die. but still he staggers toward nolan, raising the tire iron. nolan, gun in hand, watches incredulously. o'malley staggers another step. sonny has crawled out from under the car; he sees this. o'malley staggers another step.}
<C>__{o'malley}
<P>__{(to nolan, dying)}
<D>__{you don't deserve to wear your badge. with his last failing strength, o'malley raises the tire iron. nolan pumps him once, square in the chest, killing him.}
<A>__{sonny screams and flees in fear for his life. nolan races after him. between the maze of parked cars. sonny, dodging, in between the endless rows. meanwhile a small crowd has gathered around the mortally wounded o'malley. suddenly, o.s. we hear the screeching of tires. the crowd reacts as the gullwing blasts into the lot, roaring straight toward nolan and the terrorized sonny. finally, unable to get any closer, storm leaps out of the gullwing, onto the hood of a car and races across the rooftops of one vehicle after another, closing in on nolan and sonny. andy stops in horror beside the deathly stricken o'malley.}

<A>__{from the roof of the next to last car roof in a line of parked vehicles soars through the air like a night eagle setting what looks like a new world record in the long jump surprising nolan from the rear! slamming the cop to the ground in instant death. cracking his neck.}

<A>__{stops. gasping, breathless seeing the father he hasn't seen in seven years.}
<B>__{storm}
<A>__{relieved and overwhelmed, grabs his son and lifts him off the ground in a moment of salvation and triumph. they hold each other with all their strength. however their moment is incomplete, as sonny is visibly distraught about the stricken o'malley, beginning to sob at the loss of his surrogate father. storm turns and starts to move toward o'malley on ground andy ... the crowd around o'malley. sonny breaks through, with storm half a pace behind. sonny kneels, embracing his fallen friend. storm joins his son, kneels alongside him, both mourning the loss of their dearest comrade.}
