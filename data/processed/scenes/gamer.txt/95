<A>__{in quick cuts we see simon striking badass poses; on the 3d screen kable echoes them it's like a synchronized dance.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior battleground #3 cover continuous}
<A>__{kable keeps moving he passes a blue, on his knees in the mud; the blue has completely lost his shit.}
<C>__{blue soldier 4}
<D>__{this is real, this is real, this is real!!!!}
<A>__{kable doesn't bother to shoot him; he's unarmed. but... shhhtunk. a 50 caliber shell connects from somewhere distant and the blue is vaporized, a smear on the pavement.}
<C>__{simon }
<D>__{that was sick.}
<C>__{kable}
<D>__{wait a minute... are you twelve?}
<C>__{simon }
<D>__{i'm nineteen.}

<D>__{bullshit. this is unbelievable. how am i not dead yet?}
<C>__{simon }
<D>__{cause i'm a badass motherfucker.}
<A>__{kable doesn't even register this. his darting eyes pick up a familiar face in the chaos: freek. freek has apparently volunteered as a generi con he is dressed as a postman, pulling a cart of mail behind him as he walks across the street.}

<P>__{(mumbling)}
<D>__{gotta keep my holes down... keep `em down. freek's gonna make it, gonna cut, gonna scatter... gonna burn this jointerior..}
<A>__{it all happens too quickly: a brown scrambles behind freek and ducks down, using him as a moving human shield; squeezes off a few shots freek is chopped up by incoming gunfire the brown keeps running... there's nothing kable can do. an explosion nearby pushes them forward.}
<C>__{simon }
<D>__{gibs.}
<C>__{kable}
