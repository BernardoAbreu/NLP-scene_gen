As an intense OPERATIC ARIA plays over the public address system, the FEMALE PATIENTS enthusiastically--almost violently--whack at the flying shuttlecocks. The patients appear to be varying levels of crazy. A TOOTHLESS WOMAN grins as she dives with her racket, clipping her partner in the leg. In the corner, one forlorn patient nurses her injured arm while another hurls her racket against the wall again and again. Counselors look on approvingly, despite how miserable their charges appear. In the background, a few sulking patients jump rope. Needy enters the gym unnoticed, padding along in her bunny slippers.}

The glob nails her in the eye. It takes four STAFF MEMBERS to haul Needy away as she hollers in protest. The nutritionist curls up on the floor, cupping her bleeding nose as a ring of curious patients surrounds her. She spits out a TOOTH.}

Shredded like moo-shu pork. Dead inside.}

Jennifer turns her attention back to the TV. Suddenly, we see NEEDY'S FACE pop up against the window, white and startling. Before Jennifer notices, the face disappears. Outside the house, the bushes rustle. Needy is crouched below the window. We hear the pulsing of her HEART as if via ultrasound. It's a wet, rhythmic sound: Sploish, sploish, sploish. Inside, Jennifer stretches and shuts off the TV. She turns out the light. A beat of silence. Then, the sound of cracking near the window.}

Needy shrieks as if BITTEN, but continues to strangle Jennifer, straddling her and bearing down. Jennifer's T-shirt slides up to her armpits, exposing her breasts. For a moment, her eyes meet Needy's and she grins. It's as if she has control over Needy for a split second, sexual control... Needy recoils and SLASHES Jennifer's body left and right with the box-cutter, marking a gory, oozing "X" on her torso.}
