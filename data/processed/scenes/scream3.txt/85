<A>__{this time it's apparent. there's somebody else in the bathroom. sid begins to make her way towards the bathroom door when suddenly wham! a stall door flies open. the ghost charging out at full force. sid hits the deck, sliding across the floor, deflecting the blow from the knife as the killer buries it into the sink counter. sid races for the door, killer hot on her trail. suddenly wham! the storage closet door flies open and a second ghost comes charging out, knife gleaming. he dives for sid. sid takes up her knife, buries it in her attacker's shoulder. the ghost goes reeling back into the closet. sidney slams the door closed on him. she dives for the door knob when suddenly, the first ghost comes running back at her. she ducks as he swings his knife, burying it into the bathroom door. sid bolts across the bathroom towards a tiny window in the far corner of the ceiling. using the trash as a booster, she leaps up, slides open the window, and dives out, just as the deadly pair of attackers come back for more.}
