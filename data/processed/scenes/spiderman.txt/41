<A>__{backlit by a full moon, peter somersaults to the roof of the taller building, and misses the top! he sticks to the brick facade, upside down! he laughs with the moment. a window opens below him and a pretty blonde in a towel sticks her head out. she looks this way and that, and all she sees is a man in a loud sportcoat down the street. never thinking to look up, she withdraws into the room.}
