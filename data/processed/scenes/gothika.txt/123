<L>__{interior county station holding cell day}
<A>__{bare room. a desk and two chairs. glass window panes to insure no privacy. dorothy parsons (50s) waits, seated. the door opens and a deputy escorts miranda in. she sits across from dorothy, looking as lost as can be. a long beat.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{how are you?}
<A>__{miranda doesn't answer. her mind elsewhere. namely back at the barn and how it connects to rachel.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{i needed to see you, but i'm not sure where to begin. i don't know you well, i certainly have nothing but fond feelings for you. phil always keeps me posted on his colleagues and his work and in any case, i have always thought of you as a very bright, very perceptive doctor. even though i don't know you well.}
<A>__{she pauses here. miranda looks up now. her face hollow and exhausted. bags under her eyes. a person who has seen too much. wondering where the hell this is going.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{my point is, my point being when rachel died i had, um, i suffered through these spells, these recurring dreams.}
<C>__{dorothy }
<D>__{and eventually, once i came to terms with her death, they went away. losing a child is the hardest, most inconceivable event a mother can }
<A>__{she drifts off. takes a beat to collect herself and resume:}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{the past few days i have been having the same dream. a nightmare.}
<A>__{miranda can't help but smile to herself at that.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{that word. nightmare. welcome to my life.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{this nightmare involves rachel but it also involves you. in the nightmare rachel holds a box in her left hand. a small box. and she repeats a series of numbers. now, rachel never spoke, from the time she was born she had a condition i often asked god why he punished this child in such a way she couldn't speak, but she was extremely bright. she wasn't autistic as the doctors claimed }
<A>__{dorothy parsons starts to cry. a moment passes like this. it seems she won't recover enough to continue her tale.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{mrs. parsons, you need a therapist. normally i would encourage you to schedule a session with me but as you can see }
<A>__{dorothy shakes her head, determined to finish. she pulls out a folded piece of paper.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{every night the same box in her hand and the same numbers. i wrote them down.}
<A>__{she slides the paper over. miranda watches her carefully, then looks at the piece of paper. the numbers are:}
