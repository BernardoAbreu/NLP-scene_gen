<D>__{they'll be here.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{they'll be here. huh.}
<A>__{he gestures like he's going to click on the cd player, but instead points it at her.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{are you a virgin?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{c'mon, claire. answer the question. answer the question, claire.}

<C>__{claire}
<D>__{breakfast club. i get it.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{look at me. i want to show you something.}
<A>__{she looks back over at him. he slowly undoes the drawstring to his sweat pants. starts to reach inside. claire watches, revolted and disbelieving. a beat.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{i'm kidding!}
<A>__{his hand reaches between the cushions of the couch, where he pulls out a 9mm handgun.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{i'm not kidding. where the fuck are they, claire?}
<A>__{the gun pointed at her, claire is losing her shit. her face squeezes tight, like her head's being sucked through a tiny hole. just when she's about to pop... the buzzer sounds. saved by the bell. gaines pushes the talk button on the intercom.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{speak!}
<C>__{filtered voice}
<D>__{it's ronna!}
<A>__{smiling, gaines hits the door button. claire collects her wits.}
