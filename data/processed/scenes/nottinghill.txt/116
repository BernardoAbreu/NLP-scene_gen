<L>__{interior bookshop day}
<A>__{william enters and there stands anna in a simple blue skirt and top.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you disappeared.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{yes i'm sorry i had to leave... i didn't want to disturb you.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{well... how have you been?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{fine. everything much the same. when they change the law spike and i will marry immediately. whereas you... i've watched in wonder. awards, glory ...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{oh no. it's all nonsense, believe me. i had no idea how much nonsense it all was but nonsense it all is...}
<P>__{(she's nervous)}
<D>__{well, yesterday was our last day filming and so i'm just off but i brought you this from home, and...}
<A>__{it's quite a big wrapped parcel, flat 3 foot by 4 foot, leaning against a bookshelf.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i thought i'd give it to you.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{thank you. shall i...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no, don't open it yet i will be embarrassed.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{okay well, thank you. i don't know what it's for. but thank you anyway.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i actually had it in my apartment in new york and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, i didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice. so it's been just sitting in the hotel. but then... you came, so i figured... the thing is... the thing is ...}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{what's the thing?}
<A>__{then the door pings. in walks the annoying customer, mr. smith.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{don't even think about it. go away immediately.}
<A>__{mr. smith is taken aback and therefore completely obedient.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{right. sorry.}
<A>__{and he leaves.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{you were saying...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{yes. the thing is... i have to go away today but i wondered, if i didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.}
<A>__{pause as william takes this in.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{but yesterday... that actor asked you who i was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... i heard you had a microphone... i had headphones.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in england?}
<A>__{martin edges up.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{excuse me it's your mother on the phone.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{can you tell her i will ring her back.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i actually tried that tack but she said you said that before and it's been twenty four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{okay perfect timing as ever hold the fort for a second will you, martin?}
<A>__{martin is left with anna.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{can i just say, i thought 'ghost' was a wonderful film.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{is that right?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{yes... i've always wondered what patrick swayze is like in real life.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i can't say i know patrick all that well.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{oh dear. he wasn't friendly during the filming?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{well, no i'm sure he was friendly to demi moore who acted with him in 'ghost.'}
<A>__{she's kind in here, not sarcastic.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{oh right. right. sorry. always been a bit of an ass.}
<A>__{william returns a little uneasy.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{anyway... it's lovely to meet you. i'm a great fan of yours. and demi's, of course.}
<A>__{martin leaves them.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{sorry about that.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{that's fine. there's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.}
<A>__{she's awaiting an answer.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{anna. look i'm a fairly level headed bloke. not often in and out of love. but...}
<A>__{he can't really express what he feels.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{... can i just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{... yes, that's fine. of course. i... you know... of course... i will just... be getting along then... nice to see you.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{the truth is...}
<A>__{he feels he must explain.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{... with you, i'm in real danger. it took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours but my relatively inexperienced heart would, i fear, not recover if i was once again ... cast aside, which i would absolutely expect to be. there are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films. you'd go and i'd be... well, buggered, basically.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i see.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{that reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i live in notting hill. you live in beverly hills. everyone in the world knows who you are. my mother has trouble remembering my name.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{okay. fine. fine. good decision.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{the fame thing isn't really real, you know. don't forget i'm also just a girl. standing in front of a boy. asking him to love her.}
<A>__{pause. she kisses him on the cheek.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{bye.}
<A>__{then turns and leaves. leaving him.}
