<A>__{he looks at his hand.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{his hand is dripping with blood. too much blood.}

<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{blood seeps up into the sheet beneath the curve of audrey's back.}
<B>__{barton}
<A>__{he pulls audrey's shoulder.}
<B>__{audrey}
<A>__{she rolls onto her back. her eyes are wide and lifeless. her stomach is nothing but blood. the top sheet, drawn to her waist is drenched red and clings to her body.}
<B>__{barton}
<A>__{he screams. he screams again. we hear rapid and heavy footfalls next door, a door opening and closing, and then a loud banging on barton's door. barton's head spins towards the door. he is momentarily frozen. another knock. barton leaps to his feet and hurries to the door.}
<B>__{the doorway}
<A>__{over barton's shoulder as he cracks the door. charlie stands in the hall in his boxer shorts and a sleeveless tee.}

<D>__{no... no...}
<A>__{barton is nodding as he shuts the door in charlie's face. he walks back into the room.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{audrey's corpse, in long shot, face up on the bed.}
<B>__{barton}
<A>__{he walks toward the bed, wheels before he reaches it, and starts back toward the door. he stops short and turns back again to the room. he averts his eyes as it happens, toward the secretary. he walks stiffly over and sits, his back to audrey.}
<B>__{close on barton}
<A>__{as he sits in. he stares emptily down at the desk, in shock, totally shut down. behind him, we can see audrey on the bed. he stares for a long beat. strange, involuntary noises come from his throat. he is not in control. becoming aware of the noise he is making, he stops. he lurches to his feet.}
<B>__{the doorway}
<A>__{as barton enters, opens the door, and sticks his head out.}
<B>__{hallway}
<A>__{barton peers out the see if the coast is clear.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{the long hallway. in the deep background, chet, the night clerk, is stooping in front of a door to pick up a pair of shoes. next to him is a castored shoe caddy. all of the doorways between us and chet are empty of shoes.}
<B>__{chet}
<A>__{close on him as, mid stoop, he looks up. chet's pov up the long hall. in the deep background a door is closing.}
<B>__{chet}
<A>__{he pauses, then straightens up and puts the shoes on the shoe caddy. it squeaks as he pushes it on down the hall. barton's room barton stands at the door, listening to a very faint squeak. eventually it becomes inaudible. he cracks the door again, looks out, and exits.}
<B>__{hallway}
<A>__{barton goes to charlie's room and knocks. footfalls end as the door is cracked open.}
<C>__{charlie}

<C>__{barton}
<D>__{charlie, i'm in trouble. you've gotta help me.}
<A>__{once again he is breathing hard. charlie steps out into the hall and shuts the door behind him.}

<C>__{barton}
<D>__{before you go in i didn't do this. i don't know how it happened, but i didn't... i want you to know that...}
<A>__{charlie looks into his eyes. for a moment the two men stare at each other charlie's look inquisitive, barton's supplicating. finally, charlie nods.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{he turns and pushes open the door. barton's room the two men enter. barton lingers by the door. charlie walks into the foreground to look off toward the bed. his eyes widen and he screams. he turns and disappears into the bathroom. we hear vomiting, then the flush of a toilet.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{jesus... jesus... jesus have mercy...}
<A>__{his reaction has not encouraged barton, who is more and more agitated. charlie emerges from the bathroom, sweating.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{...jesus, barton, what the hell is this? what're we gonna do?}

<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{...wait in the bathroom.}
<B>__{bathroom}
<A>__{later. barton, still in his underwear, sits leaning against the wall, staring glassily at his feet. from the other room we hear the creak of bedsprings and the sounds of bed clothes being torn off. finally there is a last creak of bedsprings and the sound of charlie grunting under great weight. we hear heavy footsteps approaching. barton looks up through the open bathroom door.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{charlie is groping for the front doorknob, cradling the sheetswaddled body in his arms.}
<B>__{back to barton}
<A>__{his neck goes rubbery. his eyes roll up. his head lolls back to hit the wall.}
<B>__{black}
<A>__{slap! slap! we are low on charlie, who is following through on a slap and backing away, having aroused barton. charlie is now wearing pants but is still in his sleeveless tee, which has blood flecks across the belly.}

<D>__{you passed out.}
<A>__{barton looks groggily up.}
<C>__{barton}
