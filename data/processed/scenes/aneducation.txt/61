<L>__{exterior park. day}
<A>__{a group of girls cross country running. jenny and her friends are at the back of the group, and the gym teacher , jogging backwards, gesticulates at them to get a move on.}
<C>__{gym teacher}
<D>__{ladies, please. christmas is coming.}
<A>__{they put on enough of a spurt to satisfy her, and then immediately stop when the teacher is no longer watching. seeing an attractive bench, they sit down. from somewhere under a skirt, jenny produces a packet of exotic looking cigarettes and offers them around.}
<C>__{hattie}
<D>__{what the hell are those?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{russian sobranies.}
<A>__{hattie and tina make snooty faces. jenny takes a cigarette. the others follow suit. jenny lights them, and they all grimace. the contrast between the sophisticated cigarettes, and the unsophisticated smokers and context is pronounced.}
<C>__{hattie}
<D>__{where did they come from?}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{she might have bought them from the savoy, or claridges, or the opera, or some fancy nightclub. who knows, with jenny?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{paris. you can't buy them here.}
<C>__{tina}
<P>__{(suddenly looking at her suspiciously)}
<D>__{you never bought them yourself?}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(mimicking tina's grammar cruelly)}
<D>__{no. i never.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{shut up, you stuck up cow.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{but i will bring you some back, if you want.}

<C>__{tina}
<D>__{isn't it your birthday next tuesday?}
<C>__{jenny}

<A>__{the two friends shriek and jump up and down.}
<C>__{hattie}
<D>__{oh, my god! your birthday!}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{i wouldn't like to be you. all those dinners you've had off him. ouch.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you have such a victorian attitude to sex, you two.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{oh, sorry, dr kinsey. we're not all as experienced as you. i mean, you've done it...(she counts on her fingers) i make it never! can that be right?}
<C>__{hattie}
<D>__{but your parents are just going to let you swan off like that?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{they don't know yet. david's got a plan, he says. he usually has something up his sleeve.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{i've noticed that. what did he tell them when you had your weekend in oxford?}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(animated by the memory)}
<D>__{oh, it was....(she changes her mind) david went to oxford. merton. english. and he offered to show me round.}
<C>__{hattie}
<D>__{so you have a good looking boyfriend with pots of money, brains and a nice car.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{apparently i do.}
<A>__{tina makes a bitter face.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{and they tell us there's a god.}
<A>__{laughter. jenny glances off into the distance, and spots a portly middle aged woman heading in their direction.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{sod. miss davies.}
<A>__{they stand up, grind their sobranies into the mud, kick them under the bench, and set off at a brisk trot. the sobranie stubs come to rest near a pile of dog poo.}
