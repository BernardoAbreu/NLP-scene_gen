<A>__{kylie lands, hard, tumbling over. she glances back at the front of the house. through the kitchen window she sees her mom and dad, eyes rolled back, convulsing, spitting up blood. more parasites are crawling towards kylie through the grass. she spots her family's old luv pickup truck on the driveway in front of her. she breaks for it. she throws open the front door, and jumps inside. the things approach, crawling in after her. kylie tries to slam the door shut, but it won't; many things are stuck in the door jamb. they squeak in a chorus of pain, trying to wriggle toward her. so she slams the door again, and again, and she slices the little bastards in half.}
