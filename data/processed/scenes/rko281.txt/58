<L>__{int san simeon. assembly room day}
<A>__{in a scene eerily reminiscent of the thatcher bernstein kane scene, marion sits in the extreme foreground, a man we do not know sits at middle distance at a desk and hearst stands far away. hearst has his back to them and stares out a window. the new man is mr. lewis, a tight banker from new york, 50's. he looks over a thick legal document on the desk as he speaks:}
<D>__{lewis you will retain some editorial control over the remaining}
<A>__{newspapers but the actual ownership will go to the conservation committee and the banks. we will be immediately closing 12 of the papers and the wire services. and we will be liquidating other assets as soon as possible. most of the land in mexico as well as your collection of art and antiquities }
<C>__{marion}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{mr. hearst spent his life collecting that art.}
<C>__{lewis}
<P>__{(ignoring her)}
<D>__{we've been in touch with gimbels in new york and they've agreed to hold a special sale. they're giving over an entire floor for the merchandise. you'll have to go there in person to sign the bill of sale, by the way.}
<C>__{hearst}
<P>__{(softly, not turning)}
<D>__{i will have to sell the animals.}
<C>__{lewis}
<D>__{and we don't know whether we'll be able to retain the castle. the land has some capital and we might keep it on as an investment. maybe break it up into smaller units for housing.}
<A>__{a long pause hearst finally turns and walks to them.}
<C>__{hearst}
<P>__{(to lewis)}
<D>__{when will it come out? when will the public know?}
<C>__{lewis}
<D>__{we can't keep it a secret, sir. once we announce the gimbels sale and start liquidating the assets.}
<C>__{marion}
<P>__{(pained)}
<D>__{this is your whole life. pops. don't do it. we'll find another way..}
<A>__{a long beat as he looks at her. then he quickly signs the document on the desk. he puts down the pen and leaves the room without a word}
