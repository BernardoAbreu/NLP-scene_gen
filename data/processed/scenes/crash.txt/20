<L>__{exterior road home from hospital day}
<A>__{catherine and james travel home in the back seat of a taxi. learning against the rear window of the taxi, james finds himself flinching with excitement toward the approaching traffic streams, which now seem threatening and super real. catherine watches him, aware that he is over exhilarated, very excited herself by his new sensitivity to the traffic.}
<L>__{exterior ballard apt. balcony day}
<A>__{james sits in a reclining chair on the balcony of his apartment, looking down through the anodized balcony rails at the neighborhood ten stories below. cars fill the suburban streets, choking the parking lots of the supermarkets, ramped on to the pavements. two minor accidents have caused a massive tail back along the flyover which crosses the entrance tunnel to the airport. in one of them, a white laundry van has bumped into the back of a sedan filled with wedding guests. james gazes raptly down at this immense motion sculpture, this incomprehensible pinball machine. catherine comes on to the balcony, kneels down beside him, begins to toy lovingly with the scars on his knees.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{renata tells me you're going to rent a car.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{i can't sit on this balcony forever. i'm beginning to feel like a potted plant.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{how can you drive? james... your legs. you can barely walk.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{is the traffic heavier now? there seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i've never really noticed. is renata going with you?}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{i thought she might come along. handling a car again might be more tiring than i imagine.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{you're not envious?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{maybe i am a little.}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{james, i've got to leave for the office. are you going to be all right?}
