<A>__{letty strides into the classroom, pulls the turtle away from bobby and drops it in the trash.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{who can come up here and give me a sentence with a "to be" verb in it?}
<C>__{zach}
<D>__{who was that girl?}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{come on up, zach.}
<A>__{zach approaches the board and begins to write, "i am..." he doesn't get any further before letty cuts him off.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{neater, zach.}
<A>__{zach begins again, but letty stops him when he reaches "am."}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{zach, you know the line by the "a" has to come straight down or it looks like an "o."}
<A>__{zach looks back toward his classmates for help.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{what's wrong, zach?}
<A>__{letty picks up a piece of chalk and writes an "a." she erases it furiously and works at it until the "a" is perfect.}
<C>__{l}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{try again, zach. like that.}
<A>__{letty jabs at the board with a piece of chalk. zach freezes. he sees letty's shoes, her arm, her contorted face, and, above all else, that perfect "a" staring right back down at him. letty grips zach's arm, guiding the chalk to form what looks like a pretty good "a."}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{i don't believe it. you still can't do it.}
<C>__{zach}
<D>__{i'm sorry, ok. miss mayer?}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{no, it's not ok. you'll never get to college on ok.}
<A>__{letty's fingers press into zach's arm. a tear slides ominously down his cheek.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{it has to be good, zach. do you understand me?}
<A>__{zach wrests free of letty. he's in full cry now. he backs away, stumbles, then makes a run for his seat. bobby snickers at zach's misfortune. other children glance around, unsure, confused. letty looks vacantly at the children, stares at the board and looks at the children again. she sits down at her desk and buries her face in her hands. letty's fists, clenched at first, slowly relax. she takes a deep breath and raises her head.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{i'm very, very sorry, zach.}
<A>__{zach continues to cry. letty looks down at her desk. she grabs a piece of construction paper and a jar of paste.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{you know what, guys? wednesday's not a grammar day. it's a collage day. it's a collage on the wall day.}
<A>__{letty jumps up. she slaps the paper on the wall with some paste. she motions for the students to join her. the children slowly approach her. zach lags behind.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{and, zach? zach, i want you to be in charge of paste.}
