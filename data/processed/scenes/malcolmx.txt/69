<L>__{interior shower room day}
<A>__{malcolm stands with bowed head as the hot water cascades over his broken body. he lets it run and run, but it cannot really touch his problems. on a nearby bench are his clothes, his towel and the makings for a conk: lye, vaseline, comb, etc. he turns for a moment as he sees he is being watched by someone. it's bembry standing nearby. malcolm turns away, trying to find solace in the water. he wants no part of the world or anyone, just to be left alone.}
<C>__{bembry}
<D>__{i know how you feel. like you want to lay down and die.}
<A>__{malcolm shows no flicker of interest or understanding.}
<C>__{bembry }
<D>__{i brought you something.}
<A>__{he puts down a small matchbox on the bench next to malcolm's things. malcolm eyes him like a snake but the punishment has reduced him to deep insecurity and his belligerence is more cautious than angry.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{who the hell are you?}
<C>__{bembry}
<D>__{put it in a cup of water. it's nutmeg.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{man, what do you want?}
<C>__{bembry}
<D>__{you need something. it's not a reefer, but it'll help some.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{man, get outa my face. i ain't nobody's punk.}
<A>__{but he steps out of the shower, fills a tin cup with water and empties the contents of the matchbox into it. and drinks it down quickly.}
<C>__{bembry}
<D>__{sit down or it might knock you down.}
<A>__{malcolm sits, toweling himself as the spice hits him. for the first, he smiles; this is the first relief he has tasted in prison. he at bembry wonderingly, unable to figure him out.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{if you ain't trying to punk me, what's your hype?}
<C>__{bembry}
<D>__{i can show you how to get out of prison. and it's no hype.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{talk, daddy, i'm listening. hey that ain't bad. you got some more?}
<C>__{bembry}
<D>__{that's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{what did you give it to me for then?}
<C>__{bembry}
<D>__{'cause you needed it. 'cause you couldn't hear me without it.}
<A>__{this is a new breed of cat; malcolm has never met anyone like him. he eyes him closely, as he slips into his clothes.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{what in the hell are you talking about?}
<A>__{he begins to conk his hair, but is paying attention to what bembry is saying.}
<C>__{bembry}
<D>__{i think you got more sense than any cat in this prison. how come you are such a fool?}
<A>__{malcolm looks over, piqued.}
<C>__{bembry }
<D>__{nobody can bust out like bogart does it, in the movies. because even if you get out, you are still in prison.}
<A>__{malcolm is putting the conk into his hair now.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{you ain't lying.}
<C>__{bembry}
<D>__{when you go busting your fists against a stone wall, you're not using your brains. cause that's what the white man wants you to do. look at you.}
<A>__{these last words are spoken sharply with disgust. malcolm turns his hands massaging the conk into his hair.}
<C>__{bembry }
<D>__{putting all that poison in your hair.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. all the cats.}
<C>__{bembry}
<D>__{why? why does everybody conk?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{cause i don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like }
<C>__{bembry}
<D>__{like what? looking like me? like a nigger?! why don't you want to look like what you are? what makes you ashamed of being black?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i ain't said i'm ashamed.}
<A>__{he turns the water on to wash out the conk which has begun to burn. bembry restrains him, holding his arm.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{leggo. i got to wash it out.}
<C>__{bembry}
<D>__{let it burn. maybe you'll hear me then.}
<A>__{but it is burning now.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{man, you better get off me.}
<A>__{he wrenches away from bembry and puts his head in the water.}
<C>__{bembry}
<D>__{sure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all that poison into your hair, into your body trying to be white.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{man, i don't want to hear all that.}
<C>__{bembry}
<D>__{i thought you was smart. but you just another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you. like a monkey. and the white man sees you and he laughs. he laughs because he knows you ain't white.}
<A>__{malcolm is drying his hair, finishing his conk. but some of what bembry has said disturbs him.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{who are you?}
<A>__{malcolm is completely humiliated. bembry sees this and stops the barrage.}
<C>__{bembry}
<D>__{the question is, who are you? you are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. elijah muhammad can bring you into the light.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{elijah who?}
<C>__{bembry}
<D>__{elijah muhammad can get you out of prison. out of the prison of your mind. maybe all you want is another fix. i thought you were smart.}
<A>__{and he is gone. malcolm stands looking after him, a long thoughtful moment. he is pulling the comb through his hair.}
