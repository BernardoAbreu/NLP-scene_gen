<C>__{frank }
<D>__{nothing yet.}
<L>__{exterior the mountains long shot}
<A>__{the helicopter now circles this tallest mountain "the tower", separated from a lower but equally formidable peak by a chasm of two hundred feet that drops 3,500 feet below. inside helicopter frank and maggie spotter frank newell (50s) scans the mountain wall. maggie deighan (30s) expertly pilots the helicopter through the storm winds. both wear orange jackets identifying themselves as members of the rocky mountain park rescue team.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{wait a minute there's hal.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and his date.}
<A>__{binocular pov a ledge that's part of the smaller peak. hal tucker (30s) and his "date", susan collins (20s), are decked out in climbing gear. hal's aplomb suggests he's a veteran climber susan's worried look shows she isn't. hal and susan huddle together, both cold, but okay. hal has a makeshift splint wrapped around his lower leg, and a slow burning flare in one hand.}
<B>__{inside helicopter}
<A>__{frank lowers his glasses maggie struggles with the wind.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{how do they look?}
<A>__{binocular pov hal and susan hal, now aware of the copter, looks towards it, smiling and starts jerking off the flare.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{he's signalling "okay."}
<C>__{maggie }
<D>__{where's gabe?}
<A>__{the pov dips down there's somebody climbing below, in an orange rescue jacket.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{right where he's supposed to be.}
<B>__{closer on the climber}
<A>__{this is gabe walker (30s). in spite of the cold and the snow, he's fearlessly, swiftly scaling the tower without safety lines, as if he's done it a hundred times. that's because he has done it a hundred times. this is what gabe lives for.}
<B>__{on the ledge}
<A>__{gabe, almost there, finds a fingertip width handhold at arm's length grabbing it, he pulls himself up on the ledge with a move that's just a little tougher than chinning yourself on a doorjamb. winded, gabe slumps down next to the couple, and tries to light a cigarette. the lighter only sparks.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{excuse me i know you're my salvation, and all do you think you could rescue us before your smoke break?}
<A>__{hal pulls out a box of wooden matches and lights one bogart style, one handed with a thumbnail, cupping a hand to shield it against the wind. gabe bends down for it a familiar routine. we know in a glance they've been friends for years.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{maybe you could tell me why i am rescuing you.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{basically i've fallen down, and i can't get up...}
<C>__{gabe}
<P>__{(into radio)}
<D>__{rescue one have located helpless climber, please prepare idiot line for transport, over }
<A>__{the helicopter dips down towards the ledge no way can it land there. frank lowers a rescue wire to}
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{who precariously swings out from the ledge to grab it the wire is just out of reach. hal grabs the radio.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{rescue one please remind me to tell you about the time i hauled your hero here down mt. huntington on my back, over }
<C>__{maggie }
<P>__{(through radio)}
<D>__{hal, if i hear that story one more time, i'm making you limp down the entire three thousand feet, over }
<A>__{gabe finally grabs the line, secures it to a heavy piton, and hammers it into the wall.}
<C>__{gabe}
<P>__{(to susan)}
<D>__{this guy showing you a good time?}
<B>__{the helicopter}
<A>__{swings over across to the facing mountain maggie lands the copter, in spite of the winds, on a small plateau. frank gets out to secure the wire there's now a lifeline spanning the chasm.}
<B>__{on the ledge}
<A>__{gabe finishes anchoring the line in the rock he extinguishes his cigarette in the snow, and naturally, pockets the butt. hal, propped up against the wall, expertly rigs a seat harness around his legs susan helps him get part of it around his splint, and gabe clips it to the line.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{now, remember keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times }
<C>__{hal}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{fuck you }
<A>__{with that, hal pulls himself hand over hand across the sloping line hal makes a point of looking down hal's pov the drop is vertigo defined. thirty five hundred feet straight down. you could stack the world trade center towers on top of each other and they'd still be shorter than this mountain is high. however }
<B>__{hal}
<A>__{lets go of the overhead line and claps his hands to his face in mock horror he quickly whizzes down the last thirty feet of the line, where frank catches him and pulls him out. hal gets out of the harness, checks every stitch of it, signals thumbs up, and sends it back.}
<B>__{the ledge}
<A>__{gabe, retrieves the harness on a small attachment line, and gives susan a reassuring smile, but she's still, sensibly, very scared. gabe recovers the harness, rigs susan into it, and meticulously re checks it.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{ready?}
<P>__{(sees she's afraid)}
<D>__{did he tell you about the time he almost made it up everest?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{he said you gave him a bad oxygen mask }
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{well, if he's bored you with that bullshit, then this has to be the best part of a bad date. right?}
<A>__{susan nervously laughs.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{ready?}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(scared but tough)}
<D>__{okay }
<A>__{gabe starts to push her out on the line, but she grabs his arm in a panic.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i can't }
<A>__{susan starts to tilt her head down gabe gently takes hold of her chin, turning her view up to face him.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{yes you can.}
<P>__{(reassuring)}
<D>__{you can do it. don't look down. the whole way across, don't look down. look at me. just keep looking at me and you'll be okay.}
<A>__{susan looks at gabe trying to be confident nods.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{sure?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{yeah.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i have always depended on the kindness of rangers.}

<P>__{(loud, in control)}
<D>__{hold on. i'm coming out to get you.}
<A>__{gabe gently pulls himself up on the line, crosses his ankles on it, and clips himself on with a three foot safety line. gabe starts smoothly, quickly pulling himself out, but }
<B>__{susan}
<A>__{is in trouble the bobbing of the line from gabe's weight and the winds are making her lose her grip even more }
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{urgently pulls himself along the line faster, trying not to shake the line. as he gets closer and closer to a terrified susan, his eyes lock on hers }
