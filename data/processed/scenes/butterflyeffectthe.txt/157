<T>__{back to evan:}
<L>__{interior evan's dorm day 2002}
<A>__{evan's eyes roll back in his head. he shakes uncontrollably and blood pours from his nose. thumper opens the door, sees evan convulsing and jumps back in horror. he scans the hallways for assistance.}
<C>__{thumper}
<D>__{someone call 9 1 1!}
<L>__{interior sunnyvale laboratory day}
<A>__{evan lies on an examining table undergoing another series of cat scans. the machines are now state of the art and the lab room has been redecorated.}
<L>__{interior dr. redfield's office day}
<A>__{andrea nervously chews her fingernails as she watches dr. redfield post cat scan results on the light box. a young nurse pushes evan, in a wheelchair, into the doctor's office.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{okay, doc. what's the damage? how much time have i got?}
<C>__{andrea}
<D>__{cute, evan.}
<C>__{dr. redfield}
<D>__{it's a little complicated. i haven't seen results exactly like these before.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{are you sure? not even with my father?}
<A>__{dr. redfield and andrea exchange looks.}
<C>__{dr. redfield}
<D>__{actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.}
<C>__{andrea}
<D>__{so what did you find.}
<A>__{dr. redfield points to the cat scan slides, specifically, to the outer lining of evan's brain.}
<C>__{dr. redfield}
<D>__{this is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. the outer lining of the cerebral cortex.}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(nonplussed)}
<D>__{lemme guess. would that be where the memories are stored?}
<A>__{dr. redfield stares ahead. transfixed by the slides.}
<C>__{dr. redfield}
<D>__{i've never seen anything like this. i've compared these to the ones taken last year, and there's evidence of severe hemorrhaging and massive neural reconstruction.}
<A>__{andrea stares at him blankly. evan impatiently "pops wheelies" in the wheel chair.}
<C>__{andrea}
<D>__{what does that mean for evan?}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(to andrea)}
<D>__{he's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. overload city. 'sat about the gist of it, doc?}
<A>__{dr. redfield nods, awed by evan's effortless interpretation. evan springs out of the wheelchair and stretches his legs.}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(to andrea)}
<D>__{mind if i wait in the car? the lighting here bugs my eyes.}
<A>__{andrea nods. evan shakes dr. redfield's hand.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{well, it's nice seeing you again. but you know, people to see, things to read...}
<A>__{andrea shoots dr. redfield an apologetic look. evan heads out the door, accidentally knocking dr. redfield's jacket to the floor. he shrugs apologetically and re hangs it.}
