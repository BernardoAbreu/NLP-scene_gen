<A>__{the croods sleep peacefully in their pile. except eep, who tosses restlessly on her ledge. outside, we hear the roars and howls of prehistoric creatures fighting. but then, silence. and then cutting through the primordial night is a musical sound. unsettling. unearthly. eep creeps around her sleeping family and cautiously approaches the "door" to peer outside, when suddenly whoosh! a bright light blazes through the gaps around the boulder door, bathing eep in an other worldly glow. she chases the flash of light around the cave trying to catch it in her hands. eep presses her face against the cold boulder, trying to get a look at what is outside, but she can't get more than a blurred glimpse of the canyon beyond and the disappearing light. desperate to see more, eep braces her back against the cave and pushes the plug rock with her legs. slowly, she shifts the rock, careful not to wake her father. it takes all of her strength, but she manages to move it just enough for her to barely squeeze out.}
