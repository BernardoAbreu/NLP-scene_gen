<L>__{exterior a small bazaar day}
<A>__{indy and marion have reached a tiny square, made even more cramped by its use as a small bazaar. they have started working their way through the crowd when several bad arabs and a german agent begin to converge on them. indy immediately sees what's happening and pulls the bull whip from his jacket. the first bad arab to reach them gets hit in the mouth by the handle of the whip. now all hell breaks loose, with bad arabs, innocent shoppers, baskets of fruit and tables of goods flying every which way in the constricted space.}

<P>__{(to marion)}
<D>__{run! get out of here!}
<A>__{indy catches a dagger wielding bad arab around the legs with the whip and flips him. marion is reluctant to leave indy.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{go, dammit! go!}
<A>__{marion goes. she runs off between two buildings. a bad arab takes off after her. monkey man, now standing at the edge of the square, points at marion. the monkey jumps off his shoulder and follows marion.}
