<L>__{interior oxford board of examiners room day}
<A>__{the oxford board of examiners, eminent academics all, sit four across at a lecture table, looking absolutely musty with learning. across from them pk sits, a folder in his lap. one man, professor lewis, peruses the file in front of him.}
<C>__{lewis}
<D>__{according to your submission you have ambitions to be a writer and the welterweight boxing champion of the world.}
<A>__{lewis reads the last sentence with a tinge of amusement in his voice.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{lewis}
<D>__{don't you find seeking a career as a pugilist and reading for a degree at oxford a bit, how shall we put it, intellectually incompatible.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{lord byron was a boxer, sir. and i've never heard anyone question his intellectual integrity.}
<A>__{one of the other examiners coughs theatrically to hide his smile. lewis looks down the table at the man.}
<C>__{lewis}
<D>__{i do not recall lord byron actually engaging in matches for money.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{actually, sir, there are several recorded instances of lord byron engaging in matches for quite large sums of money. examiner #2 quite right. yes. in a letter to his wife shelley makes mention of just such a thing. for hundreds of pounds, actually.}
<A>__{lewis has heard enough.}
<C>__{lewis}
<D>__{let's move along, shall we? as your presentational you've requested to read from a work of your own fiction.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{lewis}
<D>__{well, then, let us hope we'll be treated to the stirrings of another byron.}
<A>__{his sarcasm is not lost on pk. pk ignores it, opens his folder, and begins to read.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{the concerto for the southland and the death of geel piet.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{his name was geel piet yellow peter. he was a mix of half the blood in africa dutch, portuguese, zulu, sotha, and who knew what else. his father deserted his mother before he was born. his stepfather threw him out to survive on the streets of capetown when he was nine.}
