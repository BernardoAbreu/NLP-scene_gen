<A>__{naomi's aunt emma answers the door.}
<C>__{aunt emma}
<D>__{jordan?}
<C>__{jordan}
<P>__{(big smile, sweating)}
<D>__{surprise.}
<L>__{exterior hyde park day (summer `95)}
<A>__{amid towering trees and horse trails, a noticeably twitchy jordan walks arm in arm with aunt emma.}
<C>__{aunt emma}
<D>__{so tell me about this plan of yours.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{i'd like us to go to switzerland tomorrow so you can open an account. i will fund it, and i will pay you really well for your trouble.}
<C>__{aunt emma}
<D>__{oh my.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{next month maybe you can fly to new york and we can start moving the cash.}
<C>__{aunt emma}
<D>__{moving the cash.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i feel like a character in an ian fleming novel. it's all quite racy, isn't it?}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{it is, and it's illegal too. of course if you ever got in trouble, i'd come forward in two seconds, say i duped you, but even still.}
<C>__{aunt emma}
<D>__{risk is what keeps us young, isn't it darling?}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{i like that attitude. promise me you'll spend at least ten thousand pounds per month out of the account, okay?}
<C>__{aunt emma}
<P>__{(chuckles)}
<D>__{i wouldn't even know how. i really do have everything i need.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{but i bet you don't have everything you want. how about a bigger apartment so your grandkids can sleep over?}
<A>__{aunt emma notices that jordan is sweating, fidgety. he's jonesing.}
<C>__{aunt emma}
<D>__{shall we sit?}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{sure, that'd be great.}
<A>__{they sit on a nearby bench. after a while:}
<C>__{aunt emma}
<D>__{sometimes i wonder if you let money get the best of you, dear.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{among other substances.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{it's that obvious, huh?}
<C>__{aunt emma}
<D>__{it's the height of summer and you've got the chills.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{i'm a drug addict, emma. coke, pills, you name it, whatever you got. sex addict too.}
<C>__{aunt emma}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{well there are worse things to be addicted to than sex.}
<C>__{jordan}
<P>__{(chuckles; then)}
<D>__{why did i just tell you that?}
<C>__{aunt emma}
<P>__{(playful)}
<D>__{because i'm very easy to talk to.}
<A>__{jordan looks at her. a few beats, then:}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{as a matter of fact you are. my job, you know, it's tough. i mean i'm not complaining, it's just the stress. all these people depending on me. millions of dollars at stake every day. i sometimes feel i've bitten off more than i can chew.}
<C>__{aunt emma}
<D>__{you're a man with large appetites.}
<A>__{jordan looks at her and smiles:}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{is she fucking hitting on me?}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{i agree. i put it on myself. it's hard to control the anxiety, you know? it's hard to learn to relax.}
<C>__{aunt emma}
<D>__{to release the tension.}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{she is hitting on me! holy shit!}
<A>__{jordan leans in closer, casually slips an arm around her.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{exactly, to release the tension. sometimes you gotta learn to do what comes natural in life, huh?}
<A>__{aunt emma pulls back slightly.}
<C>__{aunt emma }
<D>__{is he fucking hitting on me?}
<A>__{he leans in even closer, kisses her, then:}
<C>__{aunt emma}
<D>__{stability, dear. family.}
<C>__{aunt emma }
<D>__{you take care of my niece, my love. and i will take care of everything over here.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{ah, once upon a time...}
