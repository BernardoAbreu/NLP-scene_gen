<B>__{women.}
<C>__{mona}
<D>__{so, when are you seeing him again?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{tonight.}
<C>__{mona}

<A>__{a few women look over.}
<C>__{mona }
<D>__{and then we'll have to do a paternity test. is it the cheese farmer or the red pubed bandit?}
<A>__{more women look over.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i'm not going to have sex with him tonight. it's too soon.}
<P>__{(for the women's benefit)}
<D>__{i'm not a slut.}
<C>__{mona}
<D>__{well, bring condoms, just in case.}
<P>__{(thinks, then)}
<D>__{and a pregnancy test.}
<C>__{zoe}

<C>__{mona}
<D>__{i'm not joking.}
<A>__{all of the women are now staring at zoe.}
