<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{inside the curtain}
<A>__{jimmy, an adorable six year old sits on santa's lap. santa's assistants, two busty blondes named bambi and tawni, flank his chair.}
<C>__{santa}
<D>__{and what do the jewish people do during hanukkah?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{they worship the devil and sacrifice small gentile children like me in bizarre, sadistic rituals.}
<C>__{santa}
<D>__{that's right. santa can tell that you've been a very good boy this year. run along now jimmy.}
<A>__{bambi and tawni escort jimmy out, and re enter with esther and the hammer. santa's confused.}
<C>__{santa }
<D>__{sorry folks, i don't do couples.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{if you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.}
<C>__{santa}
<D>__{excuse me? do i know you, friend? take a look around you. do you even know who i am?}
<A>__{the hammer rips off his baseball hat and t shirt. santa gasps.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{let me guess, you're the goy who stole hanukkah.}
<C>__{santa}
<D>__{the hebrew hammer! you're alive.}
<A>__{the hammer takes out his gun and points it santa.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{what's your shpiel, santa?}
<C>__{santa}
<D>__{whoa, whoa there. c'mon mordechai, is this any way to treat an old family friend? let's cut out all the unpleasantness. i admit, i went way overboard with the whole hanukkah thing. let me make it up to you. how about a peace offering?}
<P>__{(to bambi and tawni)}
<D>__{girls.}
<A>__{santa snaps his fingers, and bambi and tawni drape themselves on either side of the hammer, rubbing his arms erotically.}
<C>__{santa }
<D>__{bambi. tawni. i'd like for you to meet world renown semitic super stud, mordechai jefferson carver.}
<A>__{bambi speaks with a thick southern drawl.}
<C>__{bambi}
<D>__{oh, i declare i just love jewish men. they're so sensitive and well read.}
<A>__{esther is clearly jealous. the hammer's enjoying the attention. he looks down at bambi's breasts. we're talking huge, obviously augmented boobolas. a large crucifix chain hangs around her neck, nestled in between the mounds of silicone. we hear the requisite ding as it sparkles. the hammer is released from the sexual spell of the gentile seductress.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{sorry santa. i like my women like my matzah. unleavened.}
<A>__{the girls move away from the hammer. esther smiles at the hammer's resolve.}
<C>__{hammer }
<D>__{this is where you go down.}
<A>__{suddenly, tony draws the curtain back.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{hey, hurry it up in there. we gotta bunch of kids...}
<A>__{he sees the hammer with his gun pointed at santa's head.}
<C>__{tony }
<D>__{oh shit!}
<A>__{esther pulls out her piece and points it at tony.}
<C>__{esther}
<D>__{back it up buddy!}
<A>__{he does. the entire crowd of children can now see what's happening. hushed, fearful whispers. mc hammer steps out of line and pleads...}
<C>__{mc hammer}
<D>__{please hammer, don't hurt em'!}
<A>__{the hammer does a double take. mc hammer gives a "did i just say that?" expression.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{let's do this clean. i don't want to make a scene santa.}
<A>__{santa stands up slowly with his hands raised.}
<C>__{santa}
<D>__{well, it's a bit too late for that now, isn't it? excuse me children, if i could have your attention for a moment.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{santa}
<D>__{i'm just calming the kiddies.}
<P>__{(to children)}
<D>__{there's no need to worry about santa. he's just having a peaceful, adult conversation with his nice jewish friend, the hebrew hammer.}
<A>__{the hammer plays along, raising his hand to keep the children calm.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{hey everybody. how's it hangin'?}
<C>__{santa}
<D>__{in fact, he's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling christmas this year.}
<A>__{the hammer and esther look to one another. this riles the masses. trouble.}
<C>__{santa }
<D>__{why don't we show him how that makes us feel.}
