<D>__{they found me.}
<L>__{interior close 0n a high tech residential steel door}
<A>__{being pounded in. wham! wham! whoever's trying to get in is serious. the door shudders but doesn't give. it's state of the art residential protection.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{i might have five minutes.}
<A>__{we hear the whrrrrr of power tools going to work on his door. these people are determined. professional. and prepared.}
<D>__{eddie (v.0.) ( (cont'd) i will never know how they got past security in a half billion dollar building.}
<L>__{exterior the celestial looking into the lobby night}
<A>__{the sleek lobby is deserted. we see, through the glass, lying on the floor, the barest glimpse of the feet of what are presumably two dead security guards although their bodies are largely hidden behind their massive curly walnut desk. all the security monitors are black the feeds clearly cut.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{they've become sophisticated. before they couldn't have done this. but now...?}
<A>__{the camera rises, breathlessly, in a blur, up all 80 floors of this stunning new building, coming to rest on... eddie morgan,}
<L>__{30's, lean and stylish, standing on the exterior ledge of his}
<A>__{multimillion dollar terrace. new york city looms around him, beneath him. his hands are outstretched. balancing. he is calm, but fatalistic. he's clearly going to jump.}
<D>__{eddie (v.o.) (cont'd) i will never let them touch me.}
<A>__{his attention is caught by the sounds of a commotion in the next apartment. he looks over, at }
<B>__{the adjoining terrace}
<A>__{through the gauzy curtains of the window, two men force a middle aged man towards the windows... there is arguing.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{my neighbor must've heard the noise. opened his door to complain.}
<A>__{two muffled shots the neighbor drops. the door is pounded again. it doesn't give.}
<D>__{eddie (v.0.) (cont'd) he bought me half a minute. i wish he hadn't. last thoughts are self pitying and mine are no exception: the waste. the waste of it all. i mean, how many of us ever know what it is to become... the perfect version of ourselves. i'd come that close. to having an impact on the world.}
<A>__{the pounding intensifies.}
<D>__{eddie (v.o.) (cont'd) and now, the only thing i'd have an impact on...}
<A>__{he looks over the railing...}
<D>__{eddie (v.o.) (cont'd) ... was the sidewalk.}

<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{not so long ago, this was me.}
<A>__{eddie is walking down the street, messily eating a street falafel. his hair is longer, his clothes schlumpier, his face rounder he's out of shape. a belly bulges against his belt. he wears jeans and that worn out corduroy "writer's" sport coat the one that your girlfriend fights to give to the salvation army.}
<D>__{eddie (v.0.) (cont'd) i was a writer. two years after my copywriting job at dexter & kerr came to a non mutual end, i had, in an extraordinary burst of desperate energy, bullshitted my way into my first book contract. this was it:}

<D>__{now, at last, i was ready to write.}
<A>__{quick cuts: eddie sprawled on the couch, eating takeout and watching tv, the sink in the foreground full of dishes. eddie shooting baskets into a toy hoop.}
<D>__{eddie (v.0.) (cont'd) gearing up, that's all.}
<A>__{ eddie sleeping in his bed, sacked out, the clock beside him clicking to 11:59 a.m.}

<D>__{eddie (v.o.) (cont'd) a few days did pass this way... maybe a few months...}
<A>__{ eddie at his desk. he glances at his land line. the message light is unblinkingly green. no one's called.}
<D>__{eddie (v.o.) (cont'd) friends fled.}
<A>__{his pov pans to the foot high stack of unpaid bills next to the answering machine.}
<C>__{eddie }

<L>__{interior a midtown coffee shop day}
<A>__{a female hand slides a key across the counter to eddie. eddie stares in disbelief at his (now ex) girlfriend, lindy, an attractive, real looking girl, late 20's. she's dressed in a professional suit. she looks very sad.}

<D>__{i don't think i can keep this.}
<A>__{eddie is broadsided. hurt.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{just like that.}
<A>__{she shoots him a look of almost intolerable sympathy.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{i was kind of under the impression you cared a little more than just }
<C>__{lindy}
<D>__{if i didn't care, maybe i'd be able to stand to watch you do this.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{look, i'm going to give 90 pages to mark on friday. if you could just wait, see what he says }
<C>__{lindy}
<D>__{stop. you think i don't know what you do all day? i've loved you. i know the good stuff, and i know the shit.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{and it's all shit to you now?}
<C>__{lindy}
<D>__{you're the one living it.}
<P>__{(sympathetically)}
<D>__{don't think i don't know it's worse for you.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{then you know i could use a friend.}
<A>__{he tries to push the key back. he cares about her, but he's also "working" her sympathy, which she instantly smells.}
<C>__{lindy}
<D>__{don't you dare try that shit on me!}
<A>__{she pierces eddie with a look. doesn't take the key.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{well what'll work, then?}
<A>__{they both almost laugh. they know each other so well. but she looks away, steeling herself.}
<C>__{lindy}
<D>__{i see where it's going. you'll lose your apartment. and then what? you'll move in with me }
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{not with that enthusiastic invite }
<C>__{lindy}
<D>__{ and then it'll go on this way, and i will rag on you, and finally boot you out and then what? i mean, have you run the film?}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{she knew what was beckoning: the lower bunk in my childhood bedroom in newark. we'd even had sex on it once. and it was a thing to be pitied and avoided.}
<A>__{eddie sighs. drops the glib tone. looks at her, finally mustering the honesty she deserves.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{lindy. i really thought i had it in me to do something. i wasn't getting around it, but it was fucking there. and now, i, ah... don't think it is. there. anything. at all.}
<A>__{lindy looks at him, clear eyed, seeing him as he is, and loving him anyway.}
<C>__{lindy}
<D>__{you know what...? i'd have had you move in anyway... if...}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{if, what?}
<A>__{she looks away. its hard for her to admit this:}
<C>__{lindy}
<D>__{if it was me you wanted. and not melissa.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i never think about melissa !}

<A>__{we are in eddie's mind, in his pov, and we are seeing a lovely, willowy brunette, wearing an undershirt, bending seductively over him...}
<L>__{interior midtown coffee shop day}
<A>__{from eddie's eyes we can tell the memory is still fresh. she shakes her head, looks away. it's clearly over. she gets up. he follows.}
<C>__{lindy}
<D>__{i have to get back.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{ hey, well wait you didn't tell me what happened yesterday.}
<A>__{we can see on lindy's face that she's still vulnerably pleased that eddie remembered to ask.}
<C>__{lindy}
<D>__{i got it.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{you got it ?!}
<C>__{lindy}
<D>__{yeah. i will have my own assistant. you believe that?}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(genuine)}
<D>__{you deserve it, lindy.}
<C>__{lindy}
<D>__{yeah, thanks. i do.}
<A>__{she smiles weakly, breaks eye contact. no good to keep looking. it's over. eddie makes an attempt to reach for the check, which lindy grabs.}
<C>__{lindy }
<D>__{oh, please.}
<A>__{he knows she knows he can't pay.}
<L>__{exterior midtown street day}
<A>__{eddie is walking home, eying the homeless on the street, feeling his dismal future breathing down his neck.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{she was right. i was almost 35. no one talks about "potential" at 35. i had missed the on ramp. soon i'd be sleeping in the lower bunk of my childhood bedroom... my father happy to welcome me into the challenging field of dental supply inventory...}

<L>__{30, wears an expensive suit, looks like he comes from money.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{of all the useless relationships better forgotten and put away in mothballs, is there any more useless than... the ex brother in law?}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{shit! it's gotta be 9 years ?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{but who's counting.}
<C>__{vernon}
<P>__{(taking him in)}
<D>__{hey, you!!!}
<A>__{he genially whacks the sides of eddie's arms. eddie halfheartedly whacks back. vernon sizes eddie up.}

<D>__{jesus, eddie, pack it on, why don't you?}
<A>__{eddie didn't need that. he's very self conscious about his weight.}

<D>__{is that what she said ?! "a coke thing."}
<A>__{it unexpectedly hurts eddie. maybe it's just a bummer day. or there's a deeper wound than he knew.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{but i wanna know about this book. how's it going?}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(considering the question)}
<D>__{how's it going... well... i'm behind. i'm behind on my book, and it's pretty well polluting my days and nights if you really want to know.}

<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{okay, what is it?}
<A>__{vern reaches into his jacket, produces a tiny plastic sachet with his right hand, tapping something out into the palm of his left. he holds this up for eddie to see... a tiny white}

<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{vernon. look at me. do i look good? i smoke too much: my chest is sore. a fucking corpse has more energy than i do, i've got weird aches, possible lumps, rashes, maybe they're a condition, or a network of conditions. one of these days they're all going to hold hands, light up, and i will keel over dead. my life's in the crapper, and i don't think it's going to take a sudden upswing into the stratosphere if i do some brand new, shiny designer drug!}

<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{no. those of you who indulged... distinguished yourselves very quickly. you made yourselves clear to us.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{who's "us?"}
<A>__{steadman just smiles, waves the question away.}
<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{you went the furthest with it the fastest, so of course, to us, you're the most interesting.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{how did it get on the street?}
<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{security breach. that was never our intention. we took care of it.}
<A>__{meaning, they took care of vern.}
<C>__{steadman }
<D>__{it will never again be on the street. it will never publicly exist. obviously i don't need to detail the advantages for you.}
<A>__{a long beat. eddie doesn't trust this guy not a bit.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{and what about for you? why don't you take it?}
<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{we don't have to. you'll take it for us.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{and in return...? i do what.}
<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{just keep on doing what you're doing. we won't bother you much at first.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{and later...? what will you be "bothering" me with?}
<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{well, given where you're heading, some of our ideas are... grandiose. but, i think, achievable.}
<A>__{eddie takes that in.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{and if i don't like your ideas?}
<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{then we'll say godspeed. and your candle will have shed a brief, but lovely, light.}
<A>__{eddie knows now. they own his ass.}
<C>__{steadman }
<D>__{but let's not even go there. right now you should feel relieved, your problems are over. we just want to keep you healthy... and brilliant.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{luckily i can do that myself.}
<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{well, no, ah, that won't be the case. we shut your lab down this morning.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{my lab?}
<A>__{steadman nods.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{which one?}
<A>__{steadman doesn't blink.}
<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{all of them.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{you sure?}
<A>__{steadman suddenly chuckles not at all concerned by this. even amused.}
<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{we were right about you eddie you're gonna go all the way. let's not do anything to jeopardize that. there's no downside here we're offering you a limitless supply with fewer side effects. i think you'll be pleased with the arrangement.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{come on, let's get some lunch. i'm starving...}
<A>__{he heads for the door. eddie remains still.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{tell me something.}
<A>__{steadman stops, looks back at him.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{did i kill that woman?}
<A>__{steadman looks puzzled that eddie would ask.}
<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{do you really want to know?}
<A>__{eddie thinks. no, he doesn't.}
<L>__{exterior campaign headquarters building day}
<A>__{eddie and steadman exit, come down the steps, eddie looking thrown. he drifts along, half a step behind steadman, deep in thought.}
<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{it's not so bad, is it?}
<A>__{eddie doesn't answer.}
<C>__{steadman }
<D>__{doesn't every man on the path to greatness have to tolerate the wind drag of compromise?}
<A>__{a black limo waits at the curb.}
<C>__{steadman }
<D>__{overall, we'll all be better off... foreign policy, the courts, even the constitution could stand a little tweaking...}
<A>__{they descend the last few steps. steadman opens the limo door for eddie... but eddie hesitates. doesn't get in.}
<C>__{steadman }
<D>__{eddie?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{after you.}
<C>__{steadman}
<P>__{(cordial)}
<D>__{no, "senator". you first.}
<A>__{eddie gestures for him to get in.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{please.}
<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{all right then...}
<A>__{he gets in. and eddie closes the door after him. stands outside the limo, looking back at steadman through the rolled down window, his face a cold mask.}
<C>__{steadman }
<D>__{oh, now. don't underestimate us.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{don't underestimate your own creation.}
<A>__{steadman looks at him quizically.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{i mean, you invented it. what does it do? it puts me 50 steps ahead of you fucks.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{you think i didn't spend my days on mdt devising a personal defense structure that would scare the shit out of the israelis ? you think there's not people with a bead on you right now, right in this building? you think this conversation is private?}
<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{you don't know the caliber of enemies you'll be making.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{you want to push that button? i will show you my silos if you show me yours.}
<C>__{steadman}
<D>__{you'll run out. you'll die.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{or i will think of something. isn't that what mdt does? makes you think of something? might even tell me how to get off it.}
<A>__{a flicker in steadman's eyes. anger.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{what if i just ask the drug... how to tell the drug... how to fuck itself? i mean, isn't it like the 8 ball?}
<A>__{steadman raises his hand to the driver and the limo pulls away.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{it always answers.}
<A>__{as the limo recedes into the distance, eddie finally exhales. and only then do we see it. he's scared.}
<C>__{the end}
