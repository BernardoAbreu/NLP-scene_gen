<A>__{fred and barney drive along. (behind them, the same houses and palms seem to be going by... duplex, palm... split level, two palms... duplex, palm). barney grins, gestures towards the front of the car.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{not bad, eh? after it cures for an hour or so, it's solid as a rock.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{okay, you fixed a dented hood. but you call that a living? face it, pal, this is the stone age, and it's a dino eat dino world. you want my advice?}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{did i ever?}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{you stick with me today, cruise on down to the quarry and fill out a job application. i'm a big man there, barney }
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{you're a big man anywhere, fred }
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{i'm serious, pal. me and mr. slate are just like this }
<A>__{he takes his hand off the wheel to hold up two fingers... ends up swerving instead.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{ just like that. i know, i know you're not a clock punching guy but face it, barney it's time to grow up and put your nose to the grindstone, batten down the hatches and join the ratasaurus race with the rest of us.}
<P>__{(meaningfully)}
<D>__{it's time to retire those dreams.}
<A>__{barney looks glum, doesn't say anything. suddenly fred pulls over, stops the car.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{barney. look.}
<B>__{wide shot}
<A>__{they're at the crest of a high wide hill.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{hey. lava lane.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{remember the old days, barn? we used to race our go carts here to impress the girls.}
<C>__{barney}
<P>__{(wistful)}
<D>__{yeah, those were the days... we usta dream about coming back here some day with a real car and goin' for the goldrock...!}
<A>__{a look from one to another, and then down the hill... fred gets a malicious grin on his face.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{fred... i thought you said it was time to retire those old dreams.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{hey. since when do i have to be consistent?}
<A>__{the two pals laugh, and then with a whoop they begin pedalling like mad. they go over the top, gravity takes over and they are flying past that billboard with all the rotary club welcomes on it. but now we see a different sort of welcome, as a police car zooms out from behind it. police car closer inside are sergeant feldspar and his rookie partner, officer gravel. cackling with anticipation, feldspar opens a box marked radar detector. out pops a little bird in a police helmet. it has a stopwatch (actually, stop sundial) around its neck. feldspar points the bird salutes takes off!}
<B>__{fred and barney}
<C>__{barney}
<P>__{(spotting the cops)}
<D>__{oh oh! fred, slow down !}
<A>__{suddenly both fred and barney see the radar bird flying alongside them. it checks its stopwatch, writes a note to itself. fred is so preoccupied he doesn't notice as }
<B>__{the police car}
<A>__{cuts in front of fred. fred slams on the "brakes," sits helplessly as feldspar gets out, walks over, grinning.}
<C>__{feldspar}
<D>__{well, flintstone, looks like today's the day.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{sergeant feldspar, i... i wasn't speeding... honest...}
<A>__{fred reaches down to the floorboard as he speaks...}
<B>__{angle on floorboard}
<A>__{there's a box there marked radar buster.}
<C>__{feldspar }
<D>__{forget it, flintstone. this time i got you dead to rights }
<A>__{fred opens the box. a scary looking winged reptile sticks out its head, smacks its hungry lips.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{confident, feldspar jerks a thumb at the radar bird, turns to his rookie partner.}
<C>__{feldspar}
<D>__{gravel. get me the radar reading and i will show you how we deal with scofflaws.}
<A>__{gravel nods, steps towards the bird. the bird checks its stopwatch... and then it notices the flying lizard which is hovering nearby, licking its lips.}
<C>__{radar bird}
<D>__{whoa! wings, do your stuff !}
<A>__{the radar bird flies away at a hundred miles an hour, leaving a cloud of dust and the stopwatch behind. feldspar catches the watch, startled.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{well, sergeant, if you don't have a radar reading, i guess we'll }
