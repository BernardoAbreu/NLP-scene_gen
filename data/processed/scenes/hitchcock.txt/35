<L>__{interior production code administration office day}
<A>__{the intimidating plaque for the mpaa's "production code administration office" on the wall. stefano's title page is tapped angrily by geoffrey shurlock,}
<L>__{70s, the much feared administrator for the motion picture}
<A>__{production code. he sits at the head of a big table with two assistants. sitting opposite are hitchcock, peggy and several silent paramount executives.}
<C>__{geoffrey shurlock}
<D>__{the code will absolutely not permit you to show a knife penetrating a woman's flesh.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{i assure you, geoffrey, my murders, are always models of taste and discretion.}
<C>__{geoffrey shurlock}
<D>__{is there any improper suggestion of nudity in this murder scene in the shower?}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{she won't be nude. she'll be wearing a shower cap.}
<A>__{shurlock makes a note. a man utterly devoid of any sense of humor.}
<C>__{geoffrey shurlock}
<D>__{we might accept a shot from outside the bathroom window with marion in silhouette above the shoulders provided the glass is frosted.}
<A>__{hitch greets the suggestion with barely concealed contempt. shurlock turns the page.}
<C>__{geoffrey shurlock}
<D>__{then this scene with the toilet.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{it's completely necessary. marion flushes evidence later found by her sister. it's a clue to the girl's disappearance.}
<C>__{geoffrey shurlock}
<D>__{no american movie has ever found it "necessary" to show a toilet, let alone to flush it.}
<A>__{hitch turns to peggy and a paramount executive.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{perhaps we ought to shoot the film in france and use a bidet instead?}
<A>__{no response from shurlock's end of the room. peggy stares down at the table.}
<C>__{geoffrey shurlock}
<D>__{mr. hitchcock, if this office denies you a seal, and we're certainly heading in that direction, your movie will not be released in a single theater in this country. will you be making jokes then?}
<A>__{hitchcock gives a slow but meaningful shrug.}
<C>__{geoffrey shurlock }
<D>__{good. now why don't we go all the way back to page two...}
<B>__{on hitch}
<A>__{boiling with rage as we hear the flurry of script pages }
