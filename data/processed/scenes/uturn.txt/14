<D>__{take two for now. one a week, punk...}
<A>__{bobby is being pressed against the wall by two muscular goons. another man stands partially hidden behind the goon's frame. with one hand one goon flattens bobby's hand against the brick, with his other he clips two fingers off with a garden shear. we see bobby's face in agonizing pain, then he slides screaming to the ground until he is framed between the legs of the men. as bobby clutches his left hand the rainwater runs in streaks down his ashen, blank face.}
