<L>__{interior hallway day}
<A>__{spooner steps out into the hallway and into...an escort}
<B>__{robot.}
<C>__{escort robot}
<D>__{please follow me.}
<A>__{spooner. reluctantly starts to follow it. passes another doorway. police tape stretched across it. catches a brief glimpse of... dr. heinrich hogenmiller's body. splayed out across the floor. surrounded by crime scene technicians. he pauses. taking in the scene. then continues on.}
<L>__{interior u.s. robotics corporate boardroom day}
<A>__{two large doors emblazoned with the u.s. robotics logo open automatically. inside, an enormous glass enclosed boardroom looking out over the entire complex. spooner walks through the doorway. his escort robot trailing behind him. an army of corporate types sit around a conference table. young. energetic. you can practically feel the brains and ambition.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{usually i ask who's in charge...}
<A>__{spooner's eyes lock with a man sitting at the head of the table. 60s, handsome, charismatic. dr. lance robertson, founder and ceo of u.s. robotics.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{but everyone knows you, dr. robertson.}
<A>__{robertson smiles. pretends to instruct his people.}
<C>__{robertson}
<D>__{remind me to cut back on my talk show appearances.}
<B>__{laughter.}
<C>__{robertson}
<D>__{welcome to u.s. robotics, detective. i regret you're not visiting us under more pleasant circumstances. allow me to introduce mr. aronson, our head of legal affairs.}
<A>__{a prematurely graying man leaning against the wall. nods hello.}
<C>__{robertson}
<D>__{and the gentleman to my right is dr. alfred lanning, director of research.}
<A>__{alfred lanning, only one there in a tie. nods.}
<C>__{robertson}
<D>__{they'll be available to answer any questions you might have during your investigation. you'll understand how anxious we are to resolve this matter especially before the press gets wind of it. there are some anti robot sentiments out there as you know, detective, and we're not eager to stir them up. so. where would you like to begin?}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{we can begin with whether or not the old man put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger.}
<A>__{a palpable wave of tension shoots through the group.}
<C>__{aronson}
<D>__{you don't have to answer that, dr. robertson...}
<A>__{robertson waves him off.}
<C>__{robertson}
<D>__{susan? perhaps you can assist us here?}
<A>__{everyone looks down at the other end of the table. a beat. then an attractive young woman gets to her feet. susan calvin. hair tucked behind her ears. looking at everyone but spooner.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{dr. hogenmiller was a schizoid personality who generally eschewed social relationships. rejecting people in favor of solitary activities involving machines. he spent almost all his time at the lab here or at his lab at home. as a result he was highly susceptible to depression.}
<C>__{robertson}
<D>__{dr. calvin is our chief psychologist.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{if that was your diagnosis, why didn't you see this coming?}
<A>__{calvin turns. finally meeting spooner's eye. as if the answer's obvious.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{this is u.s. robotics, detective. seventy five percent of our employees fit that description.}
<C>__{lanning}
<P>__{(interceding)}
<D>__{you'll have to excuse the doctor. we're all a little on edge. this has been a difficult and emotional morning.}
<A>__{spooner throws a look around the room. then back at calvin.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{yeah. i can see you're all broken up.}
<A>__{robertson responds to spooner's skepticism.}
<C>__{robertson}
<D>__{dr. hogenmiller was at my side from the very beginnings of this company. we developed the "three laws of robotics" together. but these days science is a young man's game. by the time you hit thirty your best years are behind you. some of us are kicked upstairs. others i'm afraid aren't so lucky.}
<A>__{robertson stands. meeting over.}
<C>__{robertson}
<D>__{dr. hogenmiller took his own life. i trust you will come to the same swift conclusion, detective. dr. lanning will make himself available if you have any further questions.}
<A>__{spooner looks over at calvin.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{i want her to help me.}
<A>__{calvin, unhappy with this arrangement.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{that's not really my department...}
<C>__{robertson}
<P>__{(pointed)}
<D>__{susan would be happy to assist you.}
<A>__{and with a gesture, robertson dismisses everyone. people start getting up, gathering up, filing out. susan calvin. the last one to get up.}
