<L>__{interior pawn brokers}
<A>__{franky is tied up on a stool, in front of him is the case and it's open. boris waves the black guys to come into the corridor so they can talk without being heard.}
<C>__{boris}
<D>__{what are you doing with him?}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{the case was attached to his body.}
<C>__{boris}
<D>__{so why didn't you chop it off?}
<A>__{sol looks horrified by the thought.}
<C>__{vinny}
<D>__{err, because we didn't. now boris we have or rather you have a problem.}
<C>__{boris}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{there wasn't any money there. v}
<A>__{boris pulls out a wad of notes}
<C>__{boris}
<D>__{there's ten grand.}
<C>__{vinny}
<D>__{keep it. we want this, or at least half of this. ,}
<A>__{vin holds up the stone: the atmosphere changes.}
<C>__{boris}
<D>__{what was in the case was mine, what was in the bookies was yours, ok there wasn't much but, here's ten large to help the situation.}
<C>__{vinny}
<D>__{i am afraid it's too late for that boris.}
<A>__{he holds up the diamond. boris1 eyes follow him as he walks back into the room where franky is and puts the diamond back into the case while he's talking and changes the combination.}
<C>__{vinny }
<D>__{we want half and that's because we are being generous. we could by rights keep the whole fuckin stone.}
<A>__{boris grimaces and pulls out a gun from god knows where, and within a second shoots poor franky in the face. franky's body disappears off the stool that he was sitting on. the black guys are stunned into silence.}
<C>__{boris}
<D>__{you fuckin idiots. he couldn't know who i am. now open the case and give me.the stone.}
<A>__{the black guys are left with their mouths open, everything just changed gear and they weren't expecting that.}
<C>__{boris }
<D>__{who's next? you have the ten grand now give me the stone.}
<A>__{the pause continues. boris lets a shot off that tears worryingly close to sol's head.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{the only man that knows the combination you just shot.}
<A>__{boris appears little bothered by this and whips out a four foot machete that he was concealing about his person. he pulls the case towards him and brings the machete down with full force. we can tell by the expression on tyrone's face that it must have been some part of franky's anatomy. pointing to the ground:}
<C>__{boris}
<D>__{he's your problem now. you can keep the" ten grand along with the body, but if i see you again...well look at him.}
<A>__{he points to franky. while he is saying this he bends down and picks up the case from the floor and wraps the severed arm in newspaper. he then walks out of the shop casual as you like.}
