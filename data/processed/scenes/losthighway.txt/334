<L>__{intense.}
<A>__{alice her hunger appearing, now becomes carnivorous in her approach to love making with pete. she is the aggressor, highly charged she wants more and more taking, not giving, insatiable. the headlights flare their bodies in blinding light. they become amorphous, glowing shapes burning in the light. pete is trying desperately to please her to have her. the driving music fills with cracks of piercing static. the radio strains to hold the station. pete's white hot body clings to alice. he chokes with emotion.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i want you... i want you...}
<A>__{with a burning smile, alice rolls them out of the beams of light into the darkness. the wind billows a black cloud of dust around them. alice pulls away from pete and brings her dark mouth to his ear.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{you'll never have me.}
<A>__{alice glides away from pete and stands up looking down at him from above. she turns and walks, naked, to the cabin where she disappears within it. pete turns, face down on the ground in the darkness. he's holding his head and shaking. as he starts to stand he turns into the glare of the headlights and we see that it is not pete but fred. as fred stands up, the car's lights dim and the radio fades. fred looks at the car. he sees some movement inside. fred looks closer and sees the figure of a man in the back seat. close up of the man it's the mystery man from andy's party.}
<C>__{voice from behind}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{fred turns toward the cabin and sees the mystery man now standing in the doorway. fred turns again to the car, but this time it's empty. he looks back at the cabin and sees the mystery man still in the doorway.}
<C>__{mystery man}
<D>__{here i am.}
<A>__{fred is dizzy with fear and confusion. he pulls on his trousers and shoes and walks up the steps to the cabin toward the mystery man, who goes inside. fred stops in the doorway. he looks around.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{where's alice?}
<C>__{mystery man}
<D>__{alice who?}
<A>__{fred looks around again but there is no one there except the mystery man standing in the center of the room. fred stares at him.}
<C>__{mystery man}
<P>__{(con't)}
<D>__{her name is renee. if she's told you her name is alice, she's lying.}
<P>__{(filled now with anger)}
<D>__{and your name, what the fuck is your name?!}
<A>__{fred freaks, scared to death. he bolts down the stairs to the car, stumbling more than once. fred attempts to start the car which is drained of electrical charge by the use of the headlights and radio. the mystery man appears in the doorway of the cabin. he starts toward fred. the starter motor moans as fred twists the key frantically. the smiling mystery man is almost at the car, the engine catches. fred revs it throws the car in reverse and peels out away from the mystery man, whose hand is reaching for him. fred swerves the car around throws it in drive, and takes off across the dark desert.}
