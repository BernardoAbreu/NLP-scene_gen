<L>__{exterior sawyer backyard day}
<A>__{betty finn hits her ball through a wicket and squeals in delight. veronica has a motherly smile on her face.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i don't believe it. i'm winning.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{don't get cocky, girl.}
<A>__{betty bends down to shoot then raises her body back up.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i missed you. i know i'm not as, as exciting as your other friends.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{that's bullshit. just shoot.}
<A>__{betty once again bends and raises.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{ronnie, i'm still a virgin.}
<C>__{veronica}
<P>__{(warmly)}
<D>__{shoot.}
<A>__{betty finally shoots. feebly.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{betty, your daydreams are a lot better than my realities, believe me. i'm afraid though it's time to get your butt kicked.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{ronnie!}
<A>__{veoncia gigglingly shoots, but misses the wicket. and instead hits betty's ball. disturbed by the sudden dilemma, she determinedly walks to her ball and moves it away from betty's.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{hey, you're not settling for the two shots are you? knock me out girl. it's the only way.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{it's not my style, okay?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{nice guys finish last. i should know.}
<A>__{veronica sighs then knocks betty's adjacent ball sailing toward the porch and a statuesque heather duke who does not budge as the ball whizzes past her.}
<C>__{heather duke}
<D>__{brav o !}
<C>__{betty finn}
<P>__{(nervously)}
<D>__{i've got to get going, veronica. see you at the studio.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{sure. see ya.}
<A>__{heather duke walks toward the girls followed by a meandering desultory heather mcnamara, who picks up a green mallet and fragilely swings it; her early robustness a forgotten memory.}
<C>__{heather mcnamara}
<D>__{croquet won't be the same without heather.}
<A>__{heather duke hustles back toward a passing betty finn.}
<C>__{heather duke}
<D>__{oh betty, wait. i almost forgot...the whitney james teenage suicide prevention t.v. special isn't going to be taped at the studios. it's going to be done in the park.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{but i thought...}
<C>__{heather duke}
<P>__{(heading back)}
<D>__{it's going to be like a big picnic. bring some potato salad...hey, i'm red!}
<B>__{later in the game}
<A>__{heather duke's red ball slams into heather mcnamara's green one.}
<C>__{heather mcnamara}
<D>__{shit.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{so did you call people to tell them how to get to the studio tonight?}
<A>__{heather duke savagely "sends" heather macnamara's ball into the flower bed.}
<C>__{heather duke}
<D>__{back off. i called everyone, even that stoner slut. felt like giving my phone a bath. i told betty just now...damn!}
<A>__{heather duke's shot swerves wide of the wicket.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{you're so polluted. talking down to people, making fake notes....}
<A>__{veronica blows her shot.}
<C>__{heather duke}
<D>__{i don't see what gives you the right to lecture, ronnie . you were soulmates with betty finn until you realized you're the cover of seventeen magazine and she's the before half of a scarsdale diet ad.}
<A>__{heather duke bashes her ball into veronica's and prepares to send it.}
<C>__{heather duke}
<D>__{some people just don't matter. why should those who do carry their weight? am i right?}
<A>__{as heather duke swings down her mallet, veronica steps on her own ball. when heather duke's mallet makes contact, the two balls slam against each other, unmoving, with a loud smack.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{no, you're wrong. it's not even your turn.}
<A>__{the depressed and disoriented heather mcnamara, laying against a tree, pipes in.}
<C>__{heather mcnamara}
<D>__{she's right.....boy, croquet's not the same without heather.}
