<A>__{abby richter, 30's, pretty, driven and absolutely in control, walks through the lobby, greeting the security guard.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{morning, freddy.}
<C>__{security guard}
<D>__{morning, abby. another peaceful day?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{if you say so...}
<L>__{interior kphx corridor morning moments later}
<A>__{joy, 40's, the associate producer, falls in step with abby.}
<C>__{joy}
<P>__{(panicked)}
<D>__{we've got problems.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{there are no problems, joy. only solutions.}
<C>__{joy}
<D>__{the sky cam on the traffic copter has a cracked lens and they can't fix it.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{okay, that's a problem.}
<P>__{(thinking, then...)}
<D>__{call matt hardwick down at media services. he's got a few sky cams and he owes me. now, where are my weathermen?}
<A>__{joy opens a door to a waiting area.}
<L>__{interior kphx waiting area morning continuous}
<A>__{several portly latino men look up and wave at abby.}
<C>__{latino men}
<D>__{hey there!}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{hi, guys!}
<A>__{abby waves back and closes the door.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{what's with the pot bellies?}
<C>__{joy}
<D>__{research shows people like fat weathermen. it makes them feel safe.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i like the one in the green and the one in the brown, but i want to see the one in the green with less sideburns and the one in the brown with more, then i will make my decision.}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{abby!}
<A>__{larry, 50's, the pompous, uptight anchor man, catches up to them. he wears a makeup bib.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{morning, larry.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i'm sorry to do this to you, abby, but i don't think i can work with her anymore. it's bad enough i have to take her criticism at home. i can't do it on air, too. a man can only take so much.}
<A>__{abby nods, taking him seriously, but you can tell she's done this before.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{you're not a man, larry...}
<P>__{(off his look)}
<D>__{you're a newsman. a newsman isn't defined by the easy times, larry, he's defined by the difficult ones. can you imagine ted koppel or chris hansen or anderson cooper having their wives as co anchor? hell, no, because they couldn't handle it. but you can. you've got balls the size of volkswagens. don't think i haven't noticed.}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(re his balls)}
<D>__{i've only thought of them as blue as of late, but you're right. they are quite sizeable. but not disproportionately so.}
<P>__{(with pride)}
<D>__{i like to think of them as aesthetically pleasing }
<A>__{abby steps away, not wanting to ponder larry's balls anymore than she has to.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i think i've made my pointerior}
<A>__{larry nods, appeased, as she reaches the door marked abby richter, producer, "albuquerque a.m." she enters and...}
<L>__{interior kphx abby's office continuous}
<A>__{...walks in on a shouting match between josh, a leftist angry news writer, and dori, the entertainment leaning co writer.}
<C>__{dori}
<D>__{josh, nobody in sacramento gives a crap about trees in alaska! it's not newsworthy.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{oh, but full coverage on david beckham's new tattoo is vital?!}
<A>__{larry's wife and co anchor, georgia, 40 and coiffed to the gills, storms in, followed by the show's guest chef.}
<C>__{georgia}
<D>__{he's trying to kill me! he knows i can't eat crab, i'm allergic to it!}
<P>__{(to the room)}
<D>__{does anyone see this? is this a hive?}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{it looks like syphilis to me.}
<C>__{dori}
<P>__{(to josh)}
<D>__{see that? you wouldn't even know what syphilis looks like if it weren't for my story on paris hilton.}
<C>__{guest chef}
<P>__{(to abby)}
<D>__{she doesn't eat crab or beef or fish. she doesn't eat anything but chicken. you don't need a chef on this show. you need a box of mcnuggets.}
<A>__{everyone shouts at each other. abby calmly pulls out a whistle, puts it to her mouth and blows.}
<L>__{interior kphx "sacramento am" set morning 5}
<A>__{cameras roll as the chef happily cooks away on the set. georgia and larry taste samples of what he's prepared.}
<C>__{georgia}
<D>__{i have to tell you, bruce. this is the best chicken kiev i've ever tasted.}
<C>__{guest chef}
<D>__{actually it's duck kiev. duck makes an excellent alternative for chicken, georgia.}
<A>__{javier, the new fat weatherman, takes a huge bite.}
<C>__{javier}
<D>__{can i take home the leftovers?}
<A>__{they all laugh.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{when we return, our live skycam traffic update and more on david beckham's hundred thousand dollar tattoo.}
<C>__{georgia}
<D>__{and what you can do to help preserve the ancient forests of alaska and how it might help your albuquerque electric bill.}
<L>__{interior kphx control room morning 6}
<A>__{abby and joy stand next to cliff, the show's director.}
<C>__{cliff}
<D>__{go to commercial.}
<P>__{(to abby)}
<D>__{i don't know how you do it.}
<L>__{6}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{it's just a matter of staring the chaos in the eye and showing it who's boss. nice work, guys.}
<A>__{she pats him on the back and heads out of the control room.}
<C>__{joy}
<P>__{(to abby)}
<D>__{stuart wants to see you. he's freaking out.}
<C>__{abby}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{that means he got the numbers.}

<A>__{abby talks to stuart wardlow, 60's, kphx's curmudgeonly general manager.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{have you seen the ratings for yesterday? we got beat by all the network shows, plus a rerun of "who's the boss". the one where the vacuum breaks.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{it's a temporary setback. this week we'll do better.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{the guy with the cable access show on channel 83 does better. if we programed jerry springer re runs, we'd do a nine share at a quarter the price.}
<A>__{abby looks worried.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{please tell me you're not thinking of killing the show.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{i'm not, but i can guarantee you that's what the new management's thinking.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{stuart, "sacramento am" is an award winning news program.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{management doesn't listen to awards. it listens to numbers. we're not a family run station anymore, abby. you're good at what you do, but you've got to get me some numbers. i've got two daughters in college and a son in beauty school. i don't know how much you know about vidal sassoon but that shit ain't cheap.}
<A>__{abby nods.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{you can count on me, stuart.}
<L>__{interior kphx women's bathroom day 8}
<A>__{abby and joy stand at the sinks. abby compulsively flosses in front of the mirror.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i can't be letting corporate management dictate the content of this show. this is my show. i control it.}
<A>__{she rips out an extra two feet of floss.}
<C>__{abby }
<D>__{i should cancel my date tonight and make a list of ideas for sweeps.}
<C>__{joy}
<D>__{absolutely not. you should be out, observing humanity. humanity's who watches our show.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{yeah, all 2.47% of them.}
<C>__{joy}
<D>__{you've already rescheduled on this guy three times. you cancel tonight and he's gone. he's read more than a dozen books, he has a 401k and he's cute.}
<A>__{she holds up her clipboard, which has the guy's e harmony profile and photo.}
<D>__{joy (cont'd) (cont'd) look at this bone structure. this could be the bone structure of your future children. don't you want them to be symmetrical?}
<A>__{abby stops flossing and looks at joy.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{you printed his profile?}
<C>__{joy}
<D>__{what? i'm married. i live vicariously through your dating life. and i really think that this could be our next boyfriend. c'mon, he had nine out of ten items on your checklist.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{well, technically eight and a half. he said he could cook, but when i pressed him, he was completely unfamiliar with cumin. don't you think that's a little suspicious?}
<A>__{off joy's look, we cut to:}

<L>__{exterior upscale restaurant night}
<A>__{sacramento's nicest restaurant. diners enter and exit.}
<L>__{interior upscale restaurant foyer night}
<A>__{abby approaches the female hostess, at her podium.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{hi. i'm looking for a guy with sandy brown hair, athletic build, and blue eyes... he's 5'9 which i know what you're thinking it's a little short, but he's read the great gatsby twice, so we'll just live with it, okay?}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{technically, i'm 5'9 and 3 4.}
<A>__{she turns, mortified, to see jim, 30's and good looking. actually, he's better looking in person than in his photo. abby gulps.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{but i will read gatsby again if that makes it any better.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{jim hey. hi. hey.}
<C>__{hostess}
<D>__{shall i show you to your table?}
<A>__{abby and a mildly perturbed jim follow, clearly not off to a banner start.}
<L>__{interior restaurant dining area night}
<A>__{abby and jim sit at a table. abby looks around, tense.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{you know what? this is not the best angle. we should get the table over there. then we both get a view, instead of one of us looking at the busboy station.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i'm fine here.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{no, trust me. it'll be better over there.}
<A>__{he looks at her like she's crazy, as they get up and move. antoher table moments later the waiter is now taking their drink order.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{can i get you some water for the table?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{bottle of flat, please.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{you know, they've done studies that show tap water is no different from bottled water. and they passed a law recently to have all restaurants filter their tap water. so, technically it's not tap water.}
<C>__{abby }
<D>__{it's filtered water, which is exactly what bottled water is, except you don't have to pay $7 for it.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{yeah, i still like the way it tastes better.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{can i get you any cocktails?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{scotch on the rocks.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{in your profile, you said you liked red wine.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i do, i just feel like having a scotch right now.}
<A>__{she looks disappointed, then pulls out a piece of paper.}
<C>__{abby}
<P>__{(re the paper)}
<D>__{was there anything else you changed your mind about? i mean, just so i can figure it into the overall picture.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you printed out my profile?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{actually, my associate producer did. she likes me to be prepared. not that i'm ever not prepared. kudos on your comprehensive car insurance policy, by the way.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{that wasn't in my profile.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{no, but it was in your background check.}
<P>__{(off his look; changing the subject)}
<D>__{so...tell me about yourself.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{well, what's left that you don't know?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{good pointerior}
<A>__{there's an awkward silence between them. she pulls out another piece of paper, and hands it to him.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i printed out some talking points for us just in case this happened.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i take it it's happened before?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{no, but since you have nine out of ten of the necessary attributes on my checklist, i just wanted to make sure this goes as smoothly as possible.}
<A>__{as jim processes this, the waiter arrives with drinks.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{he takes a huge sip, relieved. abby looks at him.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{you realize the ice in that scotch is made from tap water, don't you?}
<A>__{he looks at her, realizing she's a complete nightmare.}
<L>__{exterior restaurant parking lot night}
<A>__{jim and abby walk to their cars. jim is walking faster than she is, trying to get away. she trots along, trying to keep up.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{next time we could go bowling. i noticed online that you're the mid ranked amateur in the state. i mean, if there is a next time. i'm not trying to be presumptuous, but i am getting a pretty good vibe here...}
<A>__{jim doesn't even consider refuting this. he just wants to leave. abby reaches into her purse and pulls out }
<C>__{abby }
<D>__{floss?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{uh, no thanks. it's late. i should go.}
<A>__{he gets into his car as she hands him his doggy bag.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{fyi, be sure to eat this by tomorrow. with curry, you can't smell if it's gone bad, so after three days, you should just toss it. really, don't even give it to a pet or anything.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{three days. got it.}
<A>__{abby has officially lost control to the producer part of herself...she knows what she's doing, but can't stop herself.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{here, just to be sure, i will write today's date on it for you.}
<A>__{abby takes a pen out and writes a date on the bag.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{it's fine, really...}
<A>__{the bottom of the bag gives out and a container of goopy leftovers spills all over jim's lap.}

<P>__{(horrified)}

<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i'm just gonna go.}

<C>__{abby}
<D>__{don't ask.}
<L>__{interior abby's condo bathroom night}
<A>__{abby, now in pajamas, flosses her teeth. she hears a noise coming from her bedroom and looks to see d'artagnan's paw in the fish bowl, trying to scoop up a goldfish.}

<D>__{d'artagnan! stop that!}
<A>__{abby picks up the cat.}
<C>__{abby }
<D>__{how many times do i have to tell you? leave juliet alone. wasn't romeo enough for you?}
<A>__{abby picks up the remote, snaps the tv on to "nightline" with brian williams.}

<D>__{i'm mike alexander and we're back with the "the ugly truth." tonight, as always, we're going to talk about what it is men and women really want in relationships. i've been looking through some books...}

<D>__{billions and billions of dollars wasted on self help psychobabble.}

<C>__{mike }
<D>__{now listen up, ladies, cause i'm only gonna say this once tonight and it's just three little words. no, they're not "i love you." here goes... men. are. simple. we can not be trained. all this "men are from venus" bullshit is a waste of your time and money.}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{you want to be a lonely hag, then keep reading these stupid books. you want a relationship, here's how you get one: it's called a stairmaster. get on it and get skinny and get some trashy lingerie because at the end of the day, all we're interested in is looks. no one falls in love with your personality at first sight, they fall in love with your tits and your ass. and they stick around because of what you're willing to do with them. you want to win a man over? you don't need ten steps. you need one. and it's called a blow job.}

<A>__{between the stage and her apartment, as mike continues his rant.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{men don't fall in love. men fall in "want." we want things. we're hunters and gatherers. we're the same as we were when we were cavemen and a gillion years of evolution hasn't done squat. trust me, there was a pamela anderson of cave women and all the cave guys were trying to stick their dicks in her.}
<A>__{mike walks over to a chalk board with the word "love" on it. he crosses it out and writes "lust."}
<D>__{mike (cont'd) (cont'd) now girls, if you want to think lust is the same as love, that's fine, but you're delusional. let's take some more calls.}

<A>__{abby is now on the phone.}
<C>__{abby}

<D>__{did i burst your little harlequin romance bubble?}
<A>__{irritated, abby begins to compulsively remake her bed.}

<C>__{abby}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{well, you're describing a woman.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{why are those qualities so threatening to you? perhaps because your complete lack of any one of them is the real reason why women aren't interested in you. at least women of quality.}

<D>__{i am not ugly!}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{well, of course you don't think so. ugly people never know they're ugly. it's like people who have b.o. they never know it because they're surrounded by their own stench all the time.}

"i have to take a dump, i will call you back." and here's one that's sunk a lot of perfectly good sexual relationships: "marriage? i'm just hanging out with you until i meet someone better." guys, use your big head to help your little head. in other words, lie. and that's the ugly truth.}

<D>__{that's the pointerior}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{when do i pick up?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{never. you make him wait until he gets frustrated and hangs up. if he's still holding on after thirty more seconds, you may actually have a chance.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{you'd better be right about this.}
<C>__{mike}

<C>__{abby}
<D>__{why would you want to help me?}

<D>__{rule number one. never criticize.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{even if it's constructive?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{never. men are incapable of growth, change or progress. for men, self improvement ends at toilet training. rule number two. laugh at whatever he says.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{what if what he's saying isn't funny?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{that's irrelevant. a fake laugh is like a fake orgasm.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{and a fake orgasm is good?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{no, but a fake orgasm is better than no orgasm at all.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{a fake orgasm is no orgasm.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{only to you. you're not the only person in the room, you know. let's not be selfish.}

<C>__{abby}
<D>__{some men care.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{no. some men pretend to care. when we ask you how you're doing, it's just guy code for "let me put my dick in your ass."}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{okay, i'm trying to decide whether i should just walk away right now, or run.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i know you think colin is above it all, but he's a guy. if he's even remotely into you, he's thought about each one of your orifices at least ten times.}

<C>__{mike}
<D>__{uh, "i'm reading tolstoy and i don't want to be disturbed"?}

<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i don't want you to be a bimbo. you need to be two people, the saint and the sinner, the librarian and the stripper. it's a delicate balance. on one hand, you have to push the guy away with cold indifference and yet on the other hand be a sexually teasing tornado.}
<A>__{abby enters, looking amazing in a little black dress and sling backs. her hair and make up are sexy but not trashy.}
<C>__{abby}
