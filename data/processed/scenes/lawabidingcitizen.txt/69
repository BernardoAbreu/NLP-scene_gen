<L>__{interior "the dome" day 69}
<A>__{a huge domed chamber. in the center of the floor stands a smaller free standing domed cage, like a bizarre birdcage. inside the birdcage: nick and garza wait. garza mans a camera. outside the birdcage: observers. some (cantrell and sarah) occupy floor level, where the video monitors are. others (iger and dunnigan) are on a catwalk above that encircles the room. a door opens and clyde is brought into the birdcage. he gazes around, checking his surroundings.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{i admit i expected something more modern. that jail downtown?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{filled to capacity. it has been for years. they had to re open this for the overflow. part of it anyway.}
<C>__{garza}
<D>__{welcome to the county jail annex. all new inmates come here. it was in the papers.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{right. prison crowding. it's a problem.}
<A>__{he sits. nick joins him, pulls out a legal pad.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{for the record: you've waived legal counsel. you've offered to confess to the murders of clarence darby and rupert ames. yes?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{we'll get to that. first, what i'd really like to talk about is the cot in my cell. it's lumpy.}
<P>__{(off nick's stare)}
<D>__{hardly any padding? steel springs? very uncomfortable?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i know what lumpy means. sorry to hear it. but we're not here to talk about prison conditions, we're here to talk about things you've done.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{start with things i haven't done. like get any sleep last night.}
<P>__{(beat, leans forward)}
<D>__{i said let's begin today fresh and rested. you recall my words?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what do you want from me?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{a bed in my cell.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{a bed. in your cell.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{yes, please. one of those sleep matic adjustables. those are best.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you want the variable temperature control too?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{that would be nice.}
<A>__{beat. nick tosses his legal pad on the table, swivels around in his chair to the observers up on the catwalk, spreads his arms in a "help me" gesture.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{anybody?}
<C>__{dunnigan}
<D>__{it's a steel cot! it's bolted to the wall!}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{i'm sure they have a wrench.}
<C>__{iger}
<D>__{we also have rules prohibiting personal items such as beds.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(looks to nick)}
<D>__{let me get this straight. you're going to let a bed prevent this confession from taking place.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you looking to deal? all right, how's this? how about i don't kick your fucking teeth down your throat?}
<A>__{clyde is mildly taken aback. the cops tense up.}
<C>__{cantrell}
<D>__{nick.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{sorry, jonas. okay, kid gloves.}
<P>__{(to clyde)}
<D>__{my daughter slept in our bed last night. she hasn't done that since she was six. you gave her nightmares. so excuse me if i don't feel like cutting any little deals today.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{my daughter can't have nightmares, because she died with clarence darby's breath in her face. you gave him a reduced sentence and his freedom. all i want is a good night's sleep.}
