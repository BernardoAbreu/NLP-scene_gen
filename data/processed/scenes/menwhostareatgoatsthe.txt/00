<A>__{...close on a man's face... he is staring at us with fixed concentration. he is sweating slightly in the summer heat. we hold for a moment. silence, apart from the soft swish of an unseen ceiling fan. wide shot the man, wearing military uniform, sits at his desk in his office, still staring straight ahead. supered titles appear, reading: general putkin, united states army intelligence sed. arlington, virginia. 1983. the general's assistant, lieutenant boone, sits at his desk, working. after a moment putkin seems to come to a decision.}

<D>__{i'm going into the next office.}
<C>__{lieutenant boone}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<A>__{the general stands up, smooths down his uniform, steps out from behind his desk and begins to walk. boone watches, with some trepidation, as the general increases his pace. he quickens to a jog, his face set with determination. he breaks into a run... then he slams into the wall of the office, rebounds and lies splayed on the floor. he stares up at the wall balefully.}
