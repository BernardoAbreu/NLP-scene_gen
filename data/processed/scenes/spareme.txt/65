<L>__{exterior kastle house, picnic table afternoon}
<A>__{kastle pulls shish kebab chunks off a skewer. he looks down to see that one of the chunks is a melted ken head. he throws it away in disgust.}
<C>__{kastle}
<D>__{i bet you didn't know that you and junior have something in common, theo: junior can't bowl anymore either. isn't that right junior? kastle slams the ketchup bottle down on junior's right hand. the table settings jump from the shock. junior sits impassively, his face a blank.}
<C>__{kastle}
<D>__{see! no feeling. tell theo what happened to your hand, junior.}
<C>__{sheila}
<D>__{after we eat, dad.}
<C>__{kastle}
<D>__{he stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. crushed all the nerve endings. junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{it's not so bad. when i'm alone, it feels like someone else. sheila grabs the bottle from junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. she leans over and whispers furiously to her father.}
<C>__{sheila}
<D>__{do you have to get your hooks into every guy i'm interested in?}
<C>__{kastle}
<P>__{(whispers back, defensively)}
<D>__{you're just like you mother! always jealous!}
<C>__{sheila}
<D>__{that's why mom ran away, because you had to control everything!}
<C>__{kastle}
<D>__{she ran away to be with that...}
<P>__{(spits out his words)}
<D>__{that motocross champion.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{your turn, theo. why can't you bowl?}
<A>__{sheila and kastle sit up.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{i don't like to talk about it.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{you're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{it depends.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{it feels good to let it out, doesn't it? sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.}
<C>__{sheila}
<D>__{you're using theo for your own deviant purposes!}
<C>__{kastle}
<D>__{look who's talking!}
<C>__{sheila}
<D>__{leave him alone!}
<C>__{kastle}
<D>__{just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you, doesn't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business! i can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that.}
<P>__{(snaps his fingers)}
<D>__{sheila and kastle sit up.}
<C>__{kastle}
<D>__{junior, how 'bout a riddle?}
<C>__{junior}
<P>__{(turns to sheila)}
