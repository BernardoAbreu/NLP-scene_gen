<D>__{in the nine months since chris' disappearance, my parents went through enormous changes. guilt was giving way to pain. and pain seemed to bring them closer. my father had humbled dramatically. and what had always been a sort of curt arrogance, the kind of man who actually thought he could cancel christmas, had given way to the vulnerability of a father's heart. even their faces had changed. it made me sad that i couldn't share with chris the new closeness i felt toward our parents.}
