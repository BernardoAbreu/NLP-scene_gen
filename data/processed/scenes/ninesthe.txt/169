<L>__{interior living room day [part one]}
<A>__{we're continuing an earlier scene from the end of part one.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{i can understand why you're a little confused.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{no. i'm a lot confused.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{theories?}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{this is all a dream.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{i'm in a coma.}
<C>__{margaret}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{then i'm dead. this is hell, or purgatorium or something.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{okay, a purgatorium is where romans vomited. but no. this is as real as anything can be.}
<C>__{gary}
<P>__{(suspicious)}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<A>__{she sits forward in her chair. by instinct, he sits back.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{everything is what it is. but you're not who you think you are.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{okay, then. who am i?}
<A>__{with practiced calm...}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{you're a multi dimensional being of vast, almost infinite power. you created this world on a whim, and decided to stick around to see how it turned out. you, this body you're in, is just one of your incarnations. avatars. call you what you will.}
<A>__{not sure he follows...}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{are you saying i'm god?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{technically, no. if god is a ten a theoretical ultimate, that which no greater can be imagined you're more of a nine.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{so what are you?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{humans are sevens. monkeys are sixes.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{what are the eights?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{koalas. they're telepathic. plus, they control the weather.}
<A>__{she didn't mean to get on that tangent...}
<C>__{margaret }
<D>__{what's important is that you, you're the big cheese. el supremo. you could destroy the world with a single thought.}
<P>__{(suddenly)}
<D>__{don't, incidentally. just file that away. but the truth is, you hold all the cards: every church, every candle, every sacrifice that's for you. when people pray, they're not praying because they want this thing or that thing. they just don't want to be forgotten.}
<C>__{margaret }
<D>__{so you understand, i would have told you earlier, but i didn't...}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{i understand. but i don't believe you.}
<A>__{he gets up to exit. (this is where we jump cut time earlier.)}
<B>__{freeze frame.}
