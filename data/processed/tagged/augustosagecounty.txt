<C>__{violet }
<D>__{found the boots in a window downtown and just went crazy: praying for those boots, rehearsing the conversation i'd have with raymond when he saw me in my boots. must've asked my momma a hundred times if i could get those boots. "what do you want for christmas, vi?" "momma, i will give all of it up just for those boots." bargaining, you know? she started dropping hints about a package under the tree she had wrapped up, about the size of a boot box, nice wrapping paper. "now, vi, don't you cheat and look in there before christmas morning." little smile on her face. christmas morning, i was up like a shot, boy, under the tree, tearing open that box. there was a pair of boots, all right... men's work boots, holes in the toes, chewed up laces, caked in mud and dog shit. lord, my momma laughed for days. silence.}
