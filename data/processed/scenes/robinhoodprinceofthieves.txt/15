<L>__{exterior country road dusk}
<A>__{nearing home, robin is buoyant. the saracen, brooding, walks two paces behind him.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{why must you walk in back of me?}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{in your land am i not the infidel? the unbeliever, the instrument of evil?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{our races have fought for a hundred years to prove that pointerior}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{then i trust it is safer to appear as your slave than as your equal.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{for an 'infidel' you have uncommon clarity of thinking. yet you refuse to tell me about your home and family.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{those are my burdens.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{you speak my language. you have the diplomacy and honor code of a nobleman. i ask again, why were you to be executed?}
<A>__{the saracen maintains a moody silence.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{so, i must continue with my guesswork. you are highborn? probably... you fell from favor... clearly... why? you broke the law? you were a rival for power? ... a woman?}
<A>__{the saracen reacts, almost imperceptibly.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{by the lord, that's it!}
<A>__{aslan is silent, but robin knows he's right.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{they say there are arab women of such beauty that they can possess a man's mind, that he would be willing to die for them. is that not so?}
<A>__{ignoring him, the saracen stops. examines the darkening sky.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{it is close to sunset.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{your people must marry women chosen for them by others, right?}
<A>__{no reply. aslan unfolds a prayer rug.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{who is she? the mullah's daughter? ... another man's wife?... that's it!}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{endless clouds. is there no sun in your cursed country?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{you dog! you painted old dog! what is her name?}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{which way is east?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{her name?}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{east?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{her name?}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{east?!!!}
<A>__{robin folds his arms. a standoff.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{damn you!... jasmina.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{ah, jasmina! is she beautiful?}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{which way is east?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{that way.}
<A>__{aslan throws his rug on the ground. kneels.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{are you sure?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i would know blindfolded. i'm five miles from home... was she worth it?}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{worth dying for.}
<A>__{robin stands smiling over him as aslan begins his prayers... baying of hunting dogs... in the distance, the boy wulf runs toward them, ducks behind a tree and clubs the leading dog with a branch. the other hounds close in... panting with exhaustion, wulf swings into the branches. a hound savages his leg. the soldiers surround the tree. the boy clambers precariously onto the highest branch... robin surrep titiously steals a crossbow from one of the soldiers' horses.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{you're not playing by the rules, boy. deer don't climb trees... perhaps he thinks he's a game bird. shall we teach him to fly? cut it down!}
<A>__{the soldiers hack at the trunk. the tree quivers.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{hold!... i am curious as to what manner of creature is so fearsome that it takes six men to attack it.}
<A>__{shrouded in his pilgrim's hooded cloak, he approaches them.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{stand back, stranger. this is no affair of yours.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{have we treed the devil himself? let me see... ah ha! a small boy. a truly dangerous animal.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{i advise you to move on, pilgrim. this is the sheriff's land.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{wrong. this is my land, and my tree. therefore, whatever is in it also belongs to me.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{i grow dangerously tired of your wit... chop it down!}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{the man who strikes that tree dies.}
<A>__{he glances nervously at aslan, who's still at his prayers. the men stop in mid swing. more surprised than scared. gisborne gestures to the largest of them.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{chop down the hooded fool.}
<C>__{robin}
<P>__{(backing up)}
<D>__{perhaps we could discuss this.}
<A>__{the soldier raises his sword. robin lifts his cape... the crossbow. shoots from the hip. the bolt thuds through the man's armor. he's dead before he lands.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{kill him!}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{aslan! it's time to redeem that vow.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{set the dogs on him!}
<A>__{aslan ignores him, lost in his prayers. robin lifts the other arm a second concealed crossbow. whumpf! the bolt flips the dog handler into the vicious pack. dead or not, he soon will be. robin unsheathes his sword.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{aslan, get off your damn knees! i have four of them cornered.}
<A>__{the saracen remains head down. or did we see him steal a glance? gisborne signals his men to attack. a wave of flashing steel.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i hope there's enough of me to satisfy you all.}
<A>__{backed up to a tree, he grabs a branch and kicks out. two men fly back. he lunges at a third. his sword strikes flesh. robin sidesteps and hurls the fourth onto a sharp tree stump. gisborne thrusts. robin reacts too slowly. blood flows from his arm. his sword falls.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{aslan!!}
<A>__{gisborne is on him, sword pressed to his back. robin freezes.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{well, hooded stranger, allow me to know your name before i run you through.}
<A>__{a moment of silence... like lightning, robin spins, kicks out gisborne's legs. slams one foot on the man's sword arm, the other on his throat. throws back his pilgrim's hood.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{robin of locksley!}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{on your knees, gisborne. pray.}
<A>__{he obeys. robin raises his sword.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{please, locksley! no!}
<A>__{robin drives the point into gisborne's rear. the man leaps.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{now get off my land. and tell your cousin the sheriff what happens to his scum when they pick on my people.}
<A>__{gisborne takes off, colliding with aslan as he folds his rug. reacts in shock at the sight of the strange arab. keeps running.}
<C>__{robin}
<P>__{(to aslan, furious)}
<D>__{you worthless savage! you travel ten thousand miles to save my life, then leave me to be butchered.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{i will fulfill my vow when i choose.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{which does not include prayer times, meal times, or any time i'm outnumbered six to one!!}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{you whine like a mule. you are still alive.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{barely.}
<A>__{aslan examines robin's wound. dismissive.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{a flesh wound. why did you let their leader go?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{after six years of the stench of death, i have no stomach for needless blood on my hands.}
<A>__{wulf climbs cautiously from the tree.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{have no fear, boy.}
<A>__{the boy nervously eyes robin and the saracen, fingering a crucifix around his neck. runs off into the woods.}
<C>__{aslan}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{the conquering hero returns.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{ha! it was you he was scared of.}
<A>__{aslan's humor is infectious. robin's anger relents.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{come, my strange friend. beyond that hill lies the prettiest little castle in all christendom. warm hearths, hot food, real beds.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{with feather pillows?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{with feather pillows. warm and soft like jasmina's embrace.}
