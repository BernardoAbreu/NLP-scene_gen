<A>__{malcolm hauls down the sidewalk. he comes to a hard stop at a street intersection. searches. spots cole running into a parking lot. cole sprints across the empty lot and reaches the doors of a building. he has to use all his strength to push open the highly ornate doors. he slips inside. malcolm jogs into the parking area. his pace slows to a walk and then to stillness as he gazes up at the building. its old stone and huge towers make it stand out from the modern buildings all around it. malcolm stares up at the historic philadelphia church quietly. a shooting pain pierces his side. malcolm's hand goes to it quickly. he waits for it to pass before starting for the ornate doors.}
