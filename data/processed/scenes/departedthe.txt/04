<L>__{interior lunch counter. day}
<A>__{costello comes in. the shop is one that sells papers, sundries, fountain drinks...and fronts a bookie operation.}

<P>__{(leaning over cluttered counter)}
<D>__{don't make me have to come down here again.}
<C>__{proprietor}
<D>__{won't happen again, mr. c.}
<A>__{the frightened proprietor hands over money. fifty bucks, a hundred, doesn't matter. costello is never the threatener. his demeanor is gentle, philosophical. almost a shrink's probing bedside manner. he has great interest in the world as he moves through it. as if he originally came from a different world and his survival in this one depends on close continual observation and analysis. young colin looks up. close on his eyes. he is fourteen or fifteen, but small for his age. bookish. costello eyes the proprietor's teenage daughter, working behind the counter. he takes a propane lighter, and, strangely, pays for it (the proprietor startled) and waits for change. he lights a more cigarette with the lighter.}
<C>__{young costello}
<D>__{carmen's developing into a fine young lady. you should be proud. you get your period yet, carmen?}
<A>__{the proprietor is uneasy. costello turns to young colin (about 14) staring at the local hero. costello reaches up above and behind the counter and takes down some cigarettes.}

<A>__{he goes over to the fridge and puts two half gallons of milk in the bag. some soup. costello turns to colin.}
<C>__{costello }
<D>__{do you like comic books?}
