<L>__{interior windowless cell day}
<A>__{this room is your worst nightmare in the middle east. it could be a cellar suite in beirut, or an interrogation cell in damascus. there is no way of knowing. it is simply an empty room with a large metal ring embedded into the floor, to which carlos is shackled. battered and badly bruised, he's obviously in great pain. the room's metal door screeches as it opens slowly and a new man whom we will call amos enters. with him are two of the arabs we've seen earlier. they're bareheaded now, without their kaffiyehs.}
<C>__{amos}
<P>__{(accented english)}
<D>__{how do you feel?}
<A>__{he smiles.}
<C>__{carlos}
<P>__{(broken english)}
<D>__{i do not speak english.}
<P>__{(in spanish)}
<D>__{yo soy cubano... de cuba... castro... su amigos... amigos... entiende?}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{you spoke english well enough to your contact... the street vendor... so please let's not play games. we're both professionals, carlos.}
<C>__{carlos}
<P>__{(with heavy cuban accent)}
<D>__{my name... ramirez... no carlos.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{yes, i know what your name is... illich ramirez...}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{no illich.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{alias carlos sanchez, alias carlos martinez, alias the jackal.}
<C>__{carlos}
<P>__{(with heavy cuban accent)}
<D>__{jou're loco man... no carlos... i am tourist...}
<A>__{amos swoops down and with one hand pulls carlos by the hair over across his knee with his throat up and other hand in a hammer lock. amos brings his face down to carlos.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{listen to me you piece of shit. i'm trying very hard to be professional about this but you are in israeli hands now... so don't play games with me... entiende hombre?}
<A>__{carlos whose neck is stretched back like a goose about to be slaughtered can barely croak out an answer.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{amos loosens his grasp and straightens up. carlos winces in pain from broken ribs. as he speaks it is now unaccented english, just the slightest trace of spanish background.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{you... you're telling me you're israelis... not arabs?}
<P>__{(relieved)}
<D>__{i'm in some kind of an israeli prison... is that what you're telling me?}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{amazing how much your english has improved in just a few seconds...}
<C>__{carlos}
<P>__{(trying to be very reasonable)}
<D>__{look, obviously there has been some kind of mistake. i don't know who you think i am, but i am a lieutenant commander in the united states navy, okay? i am lieutenant commander annibal ramirez of the u.s.s. yorktown, sixth fleet, docked in haifa. i am not carlos or sanchez or illich or the jackal or whoever you think you just caught. if you call the u.s. embassy and ask for the sixth fleet liaison officer, he'll confirm everything i've said.}
<A>__{he is not pushy, just firm and decisive.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{remarkable... remarkable performance... the chutzpa of it is unbelievable... my hat is off to you carlos.}
<A>__{carlos, who from now on out will be referred to by his real name, ramirez, has had it with the reasoned approach. he now adopts the demeanor of a u.s. naval officer reaming an enlisted man a brand new bunghole.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{your hat's off?! i will tear your head off! you get on the horn and you call the u.s. embassy and you call the sixth fleet liaison office and then motherfucker you go out and find yourself a good lawyer and i will tell you somethin' jack, i'm gonna sue your ass so bad that your great great grandchildren will still be shovelin' shit to pay off the debt!}
<A>__{amos is doing his best to look unflappable.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{carlos... give me a break, huh? if you were an american officer you would have... id papers, dog tags.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{i ditched 'em in an alley just before you guys got me. go back there you'll find 'em.}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{you ditched them.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{per instructions... an american officer on shore leave in the middle east must travel in mufti, civilian clothes. a bunch of arabs start chasing me... could be terrorism... could be kidnapping... instructions are to ditch our tags, our id or anything else that could identify us. that's why i spoke spanish, that's why i said i was a cuban, not an american. and you broke my ribs here asshole. i'm gonna sue you, i'm gonna sue your government... i'm gonna sue every fuckin' jew i can get my hands on you, understand me?!}
