<L>__{interior senate hearing room capitol bldg. day}
<A>__{blinding in their white uniforms, naval flag officers sit in the audience, showing their support for theodore hayes, a 50 year old civilian. this is his confirmation hearing. reading from prepared material:}
<C>__{hayes}
<D>__{... last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service, particularly in the land based maritime specialties. what's more, the navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on }
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{whoa, whoa, whoa. "land based maritime specialties." gimme a second here to de euphemize that...}
<A>__{at the center of a dais, lillian dehaven leans back to ponder the ceiling of the hearing room. her plaque card reads "chairperson senate arms committee." dehaven is a tough hided old southern belle, scarlett o'hara at 60. in her arsenal she carries conversational hand grenades and she's apt to pull a pin at the slightest whim.}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{would that be anything like "typing"? "restocking the cupboards"? that sort of thing, mr. hayes?}
<A>__{chuckles from the packed gallery. the flag officers go stone faced. hayes forces a smile.}
<C>__{hayes}
<D>__{hardly the case, senator.}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{well, i'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if i jump right in here before they discontinue my blood type. i am deeply concerned over the navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military. case in pointerior..}
<A>__{on cue, aides begin distributing reports to other members of the dais. hayes gets a copy, too. and it jars him.}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{"the lark report."}
<C>__{hayes}
<D>__{madam senator... this is an internal document of the u.s. navy. i must seriously question whether }
<C>__{dehaven}
<P>__{(to others on panel)}
<D>__{the navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an f 14 aboard an aircraft carrier. female aviator, it just so happens.}
<P>__{(to hayes)}
<D>__{you're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am i right?}
<C>__{hayes}
<D>__{i was one member of the investigating commission.}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{yes, i see your signature right here twice the size of everyone else's. and your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?}
<C>__{hayes}
<D>__{i'm really not prepared for any kind of in depth review of }
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{i'd like to think our next secretary of the navy would be prepared for anything, mr. hayes.}
<A>__{a humorless smile. she's roasting his nuts over an open fire, and everyone knows it.}
<C>__{hayes}
<D>__{the commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{that aside for the moment, i'm struck by the tenor, the ill spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.}
<P>__{(closing report)}
<D>__{in my seven years on this committee, i've never seen a downed aviator treated like this. never. i'm deeply disturbed by this report, mr. hayes. not just what it bodes for women in the military but for your own confirmation as well.}
<L>__{interior corridor capitol bldg. day}
<A>__{heading for her office, dehaven is escorted by a small}
<B>__{press retinue.}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{... a full 35 percent of all jobs in the u.s. military are still, to this day, off limits to women. and that's simply gotta change. press #1 what about those who say women aren't suited for all jobs? that they're physically weaker... they have less stamina...}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{sure. and we're gonna hog the bathroom, too.}
<A>__{dehaven's aide catches up, pulls her aside.}
<C>__{dehaven's aide}
<D>__{white house boys want a private meeting.}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{i will act surprised.}
<L>__{interior dehaven's office capitol bldg. day}
<A>__{shoes dumped on her desk, dehaven changes out knee high stockings while devoting one ear to...}
<D>__{white house #1 ... to reassure you that he has every faith in the ability of mr. hayes to guide the navy into the next century. the task, as the administration sees it, is to acknowledge changing realities without losing traditional values.}
<A>__{a beat. dehaven looks between the two white house boys #1 young and eager, #2 older and cagier.}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{'zat it? ten minutes, nothin' on the table? sweetcakes, you best go back to the president and tell him to open up the phone book and start lookin' for his next nominee.}
<A>__{white house #1 looks spanked. taking over, #2 pops a briefcase. an inch think report appears before dehaven.}
<D>__{white house #2 administration's plan for 100 percent integration. if female candidates measure up in a series of test cases, the president will support full integration within three years' time.}
<A>__{surprised maybe even startled dehaven flips through the report, absorbing by osmosis.}
<D>__{white house #2 it's your gender blind navy, senator. surely you're not going to balk now.}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{well, it's just that askin' you all to integrate the navy is like sending a man to do a woman's job.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{how do you propose to handle the combat exclusion laws? white house #2 keep narrowing the definitions. keep redefining. white house #1 we got around it in saudi arabia.}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{by calling women "honorary men." ingenious. white house #2 c'mon, senator, president's pitchin' right down the center of your plate. if women measure up to men, they've got the job. you going to take a swing? or step out of the box?}
<A>__{dehaven riffles the edges of the report, thinking it over. thinking light years ahead.}
<L>__{exterior capitol bldg. day}
<A>__{buttoning up topcoats, the white house boys move down marble steps to reach a pair of limousines. hayes and two flag officers wait.}
<C>__{hayes}
<D>__{well? white house #2}
<P>__{(shaking hand)}
<D>__{congratulations, mr. secretary.}
<L>__{interior hayes' limousine day}
<A>__{inside the moving car:}
<C>__{hayes}
<D>__{so she picks the women, we pick the programs. seals? flag officer #1 i'd go special reconnaissance. every bit as tough and we have a 60 percent drop out rate among the men.}
<C>__{hayes}
<D>__{then i suggest we start there. flag officer #1 doesn't matter who she picks. no woman is going to last one week in a commando training course. and i don't care who it is.}
<L>__{exterior potomac river washington d.c. day}
<A>__{winterscape: dotted with ice floes, the potomac wends through the capitol city, banks iridescent with snow, morning water calm. there's an almost hallowed beauty to it all. soon we pick out... a spot of day glo. coming out of the mouth of morning. overtaking the floes. closer on jordan o'neil. she pushes her flat water kayak downriver, paddling hard and clean, making good time. gliding through the graceful arches of the arlington bridge, she passes... cars overhead. grid locked by snow conditions. in seconds jordan paddles clear, leaving the traffic behind as she heads toward the washington monument. something burrs from a life vest pocket. she rips through velcro to free a cell phone.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{lieutenant o'neil.}
<C>__{royce }
<D>__{gotta situation here. where are you? stuck in traffic?}
<C>__{jordan}
<P>__{(checking dive watch)}
<D>__{not due in for 22 minutes, sir. watcha got?}
<L>__{interior situation room n.i.c. day}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{all right, stand by, we're going to switch over to comsat...}
<A>__{a tactical officer reroutes the call via defense satellite, cryptography flashing on terminals. lieutenant commander robert royce joins other intel officers at a conference table. they're pouring over weather charts, navigation logs, high altitude nro video.}
<C>__{tactical officer}
<D>__{voice system now secure...}
<C>__{royce}
<P>__{(into speaker)}
<D>__{okay, fresh stuff: lost a nato plane over the sea of japan. elb signals leads us to believe the pilot is alive and has made his way to the north korean shore, near a fishing village, "tamyung."}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{do we know it's him using the beacon? not a decoy?}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{chances of recovery?}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{you're the analyst for east china, o'neil. analyze.}
<L>__{exterior potomac river washington d.c. day}
<A>__{riding the current, jordan blows a troubled sigh as she accesses the file of her brain. drifting past the jefferson memorial:}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{north korean beaches are the best protected, most heavily monitored in the world. the civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an early warning system. extraction team has to be small and silent i'd go with seals over delta force. problem is, don't want to hold a conventional sub off shore for target practice. where's the polk?}
<L>__{intercutting:}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{halfway 'round the world. so that's the problem we can get the team in, just not out.}
<C>__{jordan}
<P>__{(an inspired beat)}
<D>__{unless you whiskey run.}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{blank faces here, o'neil.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{quick hit technique used by capone. rigged a getaway car with running boards and handles. all his guys had to do was jump on and take a ride. check the files dprk 57 i doped it out as a contingency plan: seal team infiltrates, picks up the package, links up with recovery sub. but don't waste time opening and closing hatches. they just grab the periscope and hang on for neutral waters.}
<A>__{a dubious beat.}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{you expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare back? is that correct, o'neil?}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{only four minutes to neutral waters, sir. why not?}
<A>__{silence on the radio: they're discussing her scenario privately. during, jordan's kayak reaches the junction of the potomac and the anacostia rivers. on the far bank lies... naval intel center (n.i.c.), bristling with communication antennae. jordan stares at the complex, waiting for a response.}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{all right, sending the recommendation across the river. royce out.}
<A>__{the phone goes dead.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{no, thank you, sir.}
<L>__{exterior security station n.i.c. day}
<A>__{bundled in topcoat and scarves, military and civilian employees transit a security station on their way inside. presently jordan appears wearing a wetsuit and balancing a collapsed kayak on her head. she flashes a photo badge and double times inside.}
<L>__{interior corridor n.i.c. day}
<A>__{jordan exits a locker room. smoothing out her khaki uniform, she heads down a broad corridor with cipher lock doors. falling in step:}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{that was good headwork, lieutenant.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{thank you, sir. we hear back from the pentagon?}
<C>__{royce}
<P>__{(scoffing)}
<D>__{probably hear back from cnn first.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{hate this part. just sweating it out on the sidelines.}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{intel has its own glory, lieutenant no matter how subtle.}
<A>__{now they reach...}
<L>__{interior bullpen n.i.c. day}
<A>__{a circular chamber. dominating the ground floor is the bullpen, a hive of cubicles an computer stations. on the second floor are executive offices, ringing the bullpen.}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{by the way, i will need that option paper by 11 hundred today so i can review it with admiral hanover. and do we have any of that breakfast tea around here?}
<C>__{jordan}
<P>__{(with a look)}
<D>__{is this my glory, sir?}
<A>__{on the upper walkway, a frazzled n.i.c. secretary appears. she spots royce and jordan below.}
<C>__{n.i.c. secretary}
<D>__{excuse me, but i have senator dehaven on the line for you.}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{jesus god, what now?}
<A>__{he bounds up the stairs toward his office.}
<C>__{n.i.c. secretary}
<D>__{i'm sorry, sir no she asked to speak with lieutenant o'neil.}
<A>__{royce turns back and gives jordan a hall of fame look. "oh, really?"}
<L>__{interior dehaven's office capitol bldg. day}
<C>__{dehaven}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{so everyone i talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside.}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{thank you, ma'am. um, may i ask what this is regarding?}
<C>__{dehaven}
<P>__{(reading file)}
<D>__{high school pentathlete... rotc scholarship, graduated with honors... top marks in basic training... and, as it just so happens, a constituent of my home state of virginia. oh, the things i will do for one extra vote.}
<L>__{interior bullpen n.i.c. day}
<A>__{on the phone, jordan glances around. co workers mull within earshot. those out of earshot post e mail memos on jordan's computer: "moving up in life." "i want a full report." "don't tell her who you really voted for."}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{lieutenant o'neil, i am prepared to nominate you for the navy's special reconnaissance program. should you accept, you'll ship out to coronado next week and join in the big testosterone festival. complete the course, and you'll have a fast ticket to any assignment you want. that's my personal promise to you.}
<A>__{a beat as jordan's mind catches up to her ears. now}
<L>__{interrcutting the two:}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{"coronado."}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{california.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{i know that, sir. ma'am. it's just that... beggin' your pardon, senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{this is just a test case, o'neil. but if it works out if you work out it could well change the navy's official policy on women in combat. or, actually, its official non policy. now who's your immediate superior there?}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{captain dwyer. technically.}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{my office will fill him in and help expedite. look forward to meeting you at the proper time. jumping off now...}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{uh, question, ma'am.}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{yes, dear.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{would i be the only one? the only woman?}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{there'll be more to follow but yes, dear, right now you're the pick of a very large litter. and your success would mean a lot. jumping, now...}

<L>__{interior jordan's house night}
<A>__{it's not so much furnished as equipped scuba gear and wetsuits in the mud room, life vests on coat racks, a training bag and boxing gloves hanging in the living room. in the kitchen we find... a naked man. he's steeping tea.}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{... well, i survived basic training and three brothers so i know how to fight. what scares me are the sexual politics. i don't want to be turned into some poster girl for women's rights.}

<A>__{... and sets it down beside jordan, languishing in a tub. snow builds on a window sill. facing jordan, the man slides into the tub.}

<D>__{so why're you even considering it? are you?}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{just like you would be.}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{spec recon. those guys are world class warriors. and they will not want you there, jordan.}

<C>__{royce}
<D>__{well, you're doin' shit hot at intel.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{royce. we're the same age, we started the same time and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while i'm still down in the bullpen. what does that tell you about the navy?}
<C>__{royce}
<P>__{(shaking head)}
<D>__{she's haze grey and underway...}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{you need operational duty to really advance... you need combat training to go operational... yet combat training is off limits to people with tits. i'm topped out at intel. forget the glass ceiling i'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling.}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{so dump on me.}

<D>__{you're such a ball breaker sometimes. especially at night.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{sorry. but after our days...}
<P>__{(a thoughtful sip)}
<D>__{so if i try this thing... if i ship out to coronado... what happens here?}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{i will try to keep the door open. if you wash out, i make it so that }
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{wai', wait. what happens if it works? four months of training, three years of operational duty. what then?}
<C>__{royce}
<P>__{(blowing a sigh)}
<D>__{i don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, jordan. maybe we should just let it happen.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{which is guy speak for...}
<C>__{royce}
<P>__{(conceding)}
<D>__{sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth. but i'm trying to be honest, okay? three years is a long time. don't ask me to predict how i will feel then, jordan, because i don't know. and either do you.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{you know, right up until you said that i thought i did know.}
<A>__{wounded, she gets out.}
<C>__{royce}

<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{thank you, royce. it was shaping up like such a tough call and then you go and make it so goddamn easy. really, thank you so much.}

<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{you know him.}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{sounds familiar.}
<C>__{jordan}

<C>__{dehaven}

<D>__{what changed?}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{should probably ask him that.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{if i have to ask again, senator, i will be asking in front of cameras.}

<D>__{madam senator? your esteemed colleagues are requesting }
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{two seconds, walter.}
<P>__{(answering jordan)}
<D>__{in 1981, the supreme court was asked to rule on the issue of women in combat positions. the court cited the 1948 combat exclusion laws as a legal foundation for keeping women ineligible. that decision held for all these years until the white house, 10 days ago, moved to have the exclusion laws voided. to demolish that legal foundation.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{so? isn't the president jumping on your bandwagon?}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{what he did was light the bandwagon on fire. because he knows what i know that american families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way.}

<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{in face, i do: roper, harris, gallop they all come back the same.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{what are you saying? that a women's life is more valuable than a man's? that a women's death hurts a family more?}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{i'm saying it's not going to happen. not when the president is set to turn this into a third rail issue should i choose to ever campaign against him. he will fry me six ways to sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.}
<A>__{jordan shakes her head in disbelief. she has met the enemy and she is us.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{you were never going to let women serve in combat. you always had a safety net. or thought you did.}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{jordan. i don't expect you to fully understand this but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{so the rhetoric gets you headlines. but the reality gets you in trouble.}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{the reality is this: we send far too many men off to war. i don't need to compound the problem with women.}
