<L>__{interior kuato's sanctuary night}
<A>__{the interior of the room is an amazing contrast to its ghetto exterior. the decor is a baroque combination of middle eastern opulence and 21st century flash. it looks like something out of "the arabian nights". a man enters from another room. although the man's features are east indian, he is very much a peter lorre type; he wears a small fez cap and a white linen robe with a cowl draped around the back of his neck.}
<C>__{strange man}
<P>__{(nodding to quail)}
<D>__{your servant, fahreem kuato. i greet you by the twenty seven names that still remain, praying that you cast jewels into the darkness and given them to glow with the colors of life.}
<A>__{as kuato speaks, quail, unimpressed, talks, sotto voce, to melina.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{what use is this weirdo?}
<C>__{melina}
<D>__{ssssh...there are skills on mars that earth has forgotten.}
<C>__{kuato}
<D>__{no need to introduce yourself, mr. quail.}
<P>__{(smiles at quail's surprise)}
<D>__{tolerate my presumption, but it does not tax my powers to know that you are the most sought after man on two worlds.}
<A>__{from the street the sound of loudspeakers giving information about quail and co. can be heard. searchlight beams occasionally sweep past the windows.}
<C>__{kuato}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{this way, my dear man. we have much to accomplish }
<P>__{(ominously)}
<D>__{ and very little time.}
