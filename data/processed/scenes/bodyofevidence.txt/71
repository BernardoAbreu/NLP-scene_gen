<A>__{dulaney's confusion and emotion begins to surface. she kisses him, softly, gently. dulaney closes his eyes. he kisses her harder and harder. his passion builds his anger grows. he runs his arm over his desk, brushing everything to the floor. he grabs her and firmly pushes her down on the desk. he kisses her forcefully, his lips pressed hard against hers. she struggles against him. his hands tear at her blouse. it is rough, angry sex and it frightens sharon.}
<C>__{sharon}
<P>__{(screaming)}

<P>__{(racked with fear)}
<D>__{daddy stop it!}
<A>__{dulaney stops and looks. michael is standing in the doorway, his face filled with fear and incomprehension. tears streak down his face. dulaney freezes as the full power of his actions overwhelm him. his face floods with anguish as he tries to grasp the total effect of his behavior.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{oh jesus.}
<A>__{filled with pain and embarrassment dulaney runs from the room.}
