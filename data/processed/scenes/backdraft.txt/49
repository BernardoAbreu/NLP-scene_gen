<A>__{it's only the fire's ghost here, lazy and slow. off the corridor are rooms full of commercial sewing machines. brian enters one and drops to his knees. looks under a table, flashes his light behind a work stand. nothing. he turns to backtrack his way out when a tongue of flame suddenly leaps up through the floor in front of him, cutting off the door. brian lands on his ass as it hisses and giggles and dances unreally in front of him. i never forget a face, kid. that fire from childhood. he could maybe force his way through but jesus, the way it looks at him brian rolls away from it. looks for another doorway and ends up in thick smoke. he drops to a crawl, stays on his belly where the air's clear. when he sees it. behind some furniture. something flesh colored. shit. it's a body. he crawls up closer. it's a woman. adrenalin pounding the top of his skull off, he grabs her and stumbles back down the hall, makes a turn }
