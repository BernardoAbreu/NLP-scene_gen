<B>__{hallucination.}
<C>__{voice of malcolm x}
<D>__{it was like a blinding light and i became aware that he was in the room with me. he wore a dark suit and on his face i saw a pain so old and deep and black i could scarcely look at him. i knew i was not dreaming. he was there.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{i tell you that the most dangerous creation of any society in the world is the man with nothing to lose. you do not need ten such men to change the world. one will do. the earth belongs to us, the black man and whatever is around it, and on it and in it. praises are due to him forever for bringing to us again, our self and our property, the universe of sun, moon, and stars.}
