<A>__{another angle night frank standing upset, anxious, holding a dog bowl, a leash and verdell, who is more upset making pathetic little crying sounds. as we focus briefly on verdell... frank is talking to the sweet faced woman.}
<D>__{sweet faced woman i've been praying for him since i heard.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{so i've got to get to the hospital. if you could take the dog just for tonight. sweet faced woman oh, lord i've got all these antique knick knacks... or else i'd be glad...}

<D>__{maybe if you kept locked in the bathroom. no? okay. thanks.}
<P>__{(as he turns away and she closes the door he adds)}
<D>__{old bitch... damn dog.}
<A>__{a short laugh makes us realize that melvin has witnessed and enjoyed frank's hostile mutterings... verdell starts whimpering as a pissed frank approaches his mugger:}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you're taking him... yes... you're taking him this will clear the books. one night. you want to say "no" to me? try... because i've never felt as nuts as i do right this second. i almost want you to try saying "no."}
<C>__{melvin}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{i'm not saying nothing to you.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{thanks for looking after him.}
<A>__{frank pushes open the door to melvin's apartment and places verdell inside.}
