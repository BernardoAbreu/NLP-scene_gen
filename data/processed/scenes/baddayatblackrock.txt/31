<A>__{tim stands facing the wall, shoulders hunched, suffering. doc comes in and watches him silently, tim turns, facing doc, turns again to concentrate on a faded newspaper photograph framed and hanging on the wall. another angle tim shooting over his shoulder. focal point: the "photograph". it shows a widly grinning, moderately alert and healthy tim of perhaps five years ago. he is wearing, proudly, his badge of office, and behind him, mildly interested in the proceedings, is reno smith, his erstwhile sponsor. the heading on the photo reads: deputy sheriff named for black rock. med. shot tim and doc tim takes the photo off the wall and, holding it, turns to face doc...}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{let smith find himself a new boy. i can't take it another day.}
<P>__{(pauses, looks at doc)}
<D>__{if you're a sheriff, they gotta respect you, otherwise you can't do your job.}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{they just laugh.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i don't laugh, tim.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{why don't you?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{cut it out, tim.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{you should!}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{in the name of well adjusted manhood, snap out of it. you're going to get a complex or something.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{four years ago if i'd of done my job... if i'd of checked up and found out what happened. but i didn't! just like smith figured.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{what could you have found out? they told you a story. you had to believe it.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{do you believe it?}
<A>__{doc squirms but doesn't answer.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{do you know what happened?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<P>__{(ironically)}
<D>__{i lead a quiet, contemplative life.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{me, i didn't even try to find out.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{don't you understand?}
<P>__{(he taps the badge on his chest)}
<D>__{when you wear that badge, you're the law. and when something happens, against the law, you're supposed to do something about it. it's your job.}
<P>__{(simply)}
<D>__{me... i did nothin'. and that's what's eatin' me. what kind of prescription you got for that?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i don't know. i've never been able to find one for myself.}
<A>__{tim takes off his badge and throws it on the desk.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{only one thing don't quit, tim.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{maybe this feller macreedy has the prescription.}
<A>__{they look at each other. slowly tim picks up his badge and pins it back on.}
<B>__{out}
<A>__{sequence from original script.}
