<L>__{interior military base hospital day}
<A>__{the once pristine hospital with its glowing white beds is now a bloody chaos. every bed is already full; there are burned and broken people on the floor soldiers, sailors, civilians, firemen, all mixed in together. people are dying everywhere, and screaming in pain, or moaning and begging for help. at first we don't see evelyn, and wonder if she survived the glass; then we see her, flecks of her own blood dotting her face and arms. the blood of soldiers on her surgical apron. a steel calm has replaced her earlier frenzy, even as the other nurses are breaking down.}

<D>__{i can't tell who's gotten morphine and who hasn't!}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{take a grease pencil and mark an m on the forehead of everyone you stick.}
<A>__{a young doctor is trying to give an intravenous injection to a man who's badly charred; the doctors hands are shaking.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{don't look for a vein, just poke.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{my pen's dry!}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{use lipstick. use ammo belts for tourniquets, use your own nylons if you have to! barbara! grab anything that will hold a pint of blood and sterilize it.}
<A>__{the doctors are amputating limbs right there in the hallway. a senior doctor calls }
<C>__{senior doctor}
<D>__{evelyn! you have to do the triage! they're bringing them in with trucks!}
<A>__{evelyn moves to the door. trucks are pulling up, loaded with the wounded, young terrified soldiers bringing them inside; evelyn does quick triage as they pass.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{critical front ward!... give him morphine, he can't wait...}
<A>__{the next body through is a pilot, wings on his uniform, his chest riddled with bullets and his face shot off. for a moment evelyn falters, then she forces herself to check the dog tags... it isn't rafe or danny. evelyn sags in guilty relief.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{take him outside and cover him; he's dead.}
<A>__{she steadies herself as the next body comes through, a woman on a stretcher, her stomach shot open, pale hands clutching at the open wound. evelyn feels for a pulse.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{she's gone too, take her }
<A>__{it's betty. and though the bombs are blasting and guns booming everywhere, the world goes silent for evelyn. one of the sailors outside the door is pointing to the harbor, the nevada has begun to move.}
