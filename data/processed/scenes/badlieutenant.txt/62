<L>__{int: evening limelight nightclub the v.i.p. room}
<A>__{lt arrives. the v.i.p. room is more laid back, less populous than the throng filled cave outside. the music is muted here, and more interesting. partiers sit at the bar, or at cocktail tables. chic waitrons serve the clientele: hotshot bohemian regulars, drug dealers and hopeful rich addicts. in the privacy of the v.i.p.room, drug use is hardly concealed. lt sashays over to lite's table, sits down. lt has taken on an attitude of false bravado. he greets lite with a crazy grin. lite is grim, doesn't respond in kind. he's not amused. lt orders a vodka.}
<C>__{lite}
<D>__{do you have the money?}
<C>__{lt}
<P>__{(giggles)}
<D>__{what money?}
<C>__{lite}
<D>__{don't bullshit me.}
<A>__{lt keeps doing coke off hs wrist, even as ne speaks to lite. lt can't seem to wipe the smile off his face.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{i don't got it. not tonight. you can't get blood from a stone.}
<C>__{lite}
<D>__{this psycho can.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{oooo... big fucking scary guy. just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.}
<C>__{lite}
<P>__{(laughs in his face)}
<D>__{you're a fucking joke, you know that?}
<P>__{(turns grim)}
<D>__{he's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. and i've been waiting here since forget it. listen up. you're gonna get us both fucking killed. you know that!}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{uh uh. i'm gonna win. just make sure the bet gets in.}
<A>__{a cocktail waitress delivers lt's vodka. lt orders another one, flirts with her she's gone in a flash. lt downs the vodka in one shot.}
<C>__{lite}
<D>__{you do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids }
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{good. i will give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. i hate that motherfucking house and }
<C>__{lite}
<D>__{he's gonna kill you, man. do you hear me, motherfucker? you. dead. get it?}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{i've been dodging bullets since i was fourteen. no one can kill me. i'm fucking blessed. i'm fucking catholic.}
<A>__{this breaks lt up. he laughs until he cries. lite watches the spectacle. falls silent. they sit quietly for a moment. lt, impatient with the delivery of his second vodka, takes a bottle cut of his coat and re fills his glass. drinks it down. lite tries changing the subject.}
<C>__{lite}
<D>__{how's the case going?}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{what case?}
<C>__{lite}
<D>__{the fucking rapists, man. the punks who raped that nun. the $50,000 reward from the church! remember?}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{yeah. sure. yeah. we're on it bigtime. lots of leads. you bet.}
<C>__{lite}
<D>__{that 50 g could help you }
<A>__{lt looks as lite as if he's crazy. he shakes his head. sing songs at him as if trying to teach an impaired student.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{the mets are gonna win the series. they're a lock.}
<A>__{a change comes over lt. he leans in, gets seriously excited. lt is possessed by his memory of this afternoon's game.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{get this, man. i was at the game today. face to fucking face with strawberry! jesus! i saw him strikeout. and you know what? he looked at me, and i looked at him, and he laughed and i laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket, that he struck out on purpose, and that he's saving it up for the big one. tomorrow. today i understood for the very first time that }
<C>__{lite}
<D>__{you've really got a problem.}
<A>__{lt shakes his head. repeats himself in that sing song, didactic way.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{ that there was never any other way it could have gone.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{never any other way. so you had better just put in my fucking bet. $120,000 on the last game. the big one. come on! are you a bookmaker, or fucking what?}
<C>__{lite}
<D>__{here. look i will give you the psyho's number you call him yourself and tell him wnat you want.}
<A>__{lite stands up. he writes the bookie's number on a matchbook and gives it to lt. lite leans over and gives lt a final warning.}
<C>__{lite}
<D>__{you couldn't pay 60. you lose, you'll be in for 180. to a guy who kills people for nothing.}
<A>__{lt laughs. he's already onto the next thing. he checks out the girls at the other tables. lite takes to go. then decides to try once more to get lt's attention.}
<C>__{lite}
<D>__{i was supposed to meet him at midnight with the 60. it's already 1:00 am. be careful. i mean it.}
<A>__{lt is still laughing as lite leaves the v.i.p room. before going out the door, lite turns to look one more time at his friend. pov lite lt is engaged in a clumsy come on. oblivious. the last thing lite sees is lt grabbing a cocktail waitress' leg and falling out of his chair. lt laughs all the way to the}
<B>__{floor.}
<A>__{lite lowers his head and exits. lt gets up a moment later, brushes himself off, and swaggers out of the v.i.p. room.}
