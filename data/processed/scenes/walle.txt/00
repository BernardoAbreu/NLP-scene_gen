<T>__{fade in:}
<A>__{stars. the upbeat show tune, put on your sunday clothes, plays. "out there, there's a world outside of yonkers..." more stars. distant galaxies, constellations, nebulas... a single planet. drab and brown. moving towards it. pushing through its polluted atmosphere. "...close your eyes and see it glisten..."}
<L>__{exterior planet's surface continuous}
<A>__{a range of mountains takes form in the haze. moving closer. the mountains are piles of trash. the entire surface is nothing but waste. "...we're gonna find adventure in the evening air..." a silhouetted city in the distance. what looks like skyscrapers turns into trash. thousands of neatly stacked cubes of trash, stories high. rows and rows of stacked cubes, like city avenues. they go on for miles.}
