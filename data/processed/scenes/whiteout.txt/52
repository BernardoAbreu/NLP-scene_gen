<A>__{carrie lurches forward, holding the line with one arm. finally, she bumps into something. it moves. it turns to face her. it's the killer again. he swings. she deflects the blow with her free arm, and manages to grab the axe head. the killer tears the axe free, taking carrie's glove with it. he swings again, but carrie pulls hard on the rope, throwing him off balance. the axe cuts through the line. the killer hits the ground, and is immediately ushered away in the wind, as carrie, clinging to the rope, slides over the ice like a pendulum. the line goes tight; she's jerked to a stop. it takes everything she's got to get to her feet. she slowly struggles up the line.}
