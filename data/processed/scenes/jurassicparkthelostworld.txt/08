<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(a withering look)}
<D>__{i was misquoted. i was merely speculating on the evolutionary scenario of a lost world. i never said i was in any such place.}
<A>__{he gets up and moves to another seat on the car, away from the curious man. as he sits down, he notices two other commuters across from him are staring at him. he looks at them. they looks away. he pulls the collar of his coat up tight around him. nowhere to hide.}
