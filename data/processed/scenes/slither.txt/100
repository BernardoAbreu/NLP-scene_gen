<L>__{exterior old barn night}
<A>__{trevor sees the things flooding over the posse in the barn. the parasites are especially drawn to the posse's heads. because there are so many, the weight of the beasts knocks most of them down. trevor runs, but the things make it out the doorway, covering him like lava in one million b.c., and he buckles.}
<L>__{interior old barn night}
<A>__{a parasite slithers quickly and fluidly into wally's mouth. he gags on it. his eyes flip back up into his head, and his body starts to spasm. jack tries to pull one away from his face, but it's too slippery and it disappears inside his mouth. his body, too, convulses, and he spits up blood. bill notices the parasites slithering into the mouths of the redneck and the older cop as well; whites of their eyes, bodies convulsing, spewing blood. bill sees the things oozing up margaret's neck.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{margaret, cover your mouth!}
<A>__{bill sees trevor outside the door in the dirt, trying to slap the parasites off. bill yells to everyone:}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{don't let 'em in your mouths!}
<A>__{one starts to get in bill's mouth as he speaks, but he slaps it aside. margaret pulls her shirt over her face. starla shrieks. she puts her hand over her mouth as the parasites rush up her. she's knocked over, and falls back onto the floor. a parasite slithers between starla's lips when, suddenly, a knife thrusts down, pinning the creature to the dirt, stopping it from oozing further into starla. bill is holding the knife in one hand, his other hand firmly over his mouth. bill swats more incoming parasites away from starla's mouth. he covers her mouth with his free hand. he lies on top of her, mushing their bodies and faces as closely together as possible so the things don't get into them. the parasites swarm all over them, flapping their slimy little tails as they try to fight their way inside their mouths. but bill holds tight to himself and starla. eventually, the parasites give up on bill and starla, and begin to slither away. bill watches as they crawl off the posse and filter out of the barn in a squirmy mound. eventually, they're gone. bill takes his hand from starla's mouth. starla looks around. she sees margaret lift her face from the ground, shivering, holding her shirt over her mouth. they gaze out the front door of the barn.}
