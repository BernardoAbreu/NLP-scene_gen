<L>__{interior panic room night}
<A>__{that same starting gun has been fired in the panic room. with a strong rip, meg pulls the whole bundle of multi colored wires out of the wall and drops onto the floor with it. she trusts it at sarah, finds a wire cutter in the assorted tools, and gives her that too.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones!}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{blue is phones?}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{yes, no, i don't know, do 'em all!}
<A>__{while sarah goes to work on the wires, meg turns to the phone itself, the one with the buried phone line that isn't working yet. she rips the phone out of its housing, tears free the wire on the end of it.}
