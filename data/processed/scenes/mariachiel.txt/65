<A>__{the mean dudes are climbing over the balcony like spiders. mariachi runs back and slams his guitar into the first guy to make it over the balcony. his dummy falls down the stairs and over the narrow railing. the dude splats on the ground in gruesome closeup. the old man looks over at him as he dies, then turns back as if nothing happened. mariachi bolts back down the hill.}
