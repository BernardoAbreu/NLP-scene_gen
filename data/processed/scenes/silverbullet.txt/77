<A>__{there's one light on upstairs and another downstairs... also downstairs is the bluish flicker of tv light. an ivy trellis climbs one side of the house. sounds: canned laughter; tv dialogue.}

<A>__{stella's mother, asleep in front of the tv.}
<L>__{interior a pretty china dish, cu}
<A>__{a whole bunch of capsules are dumped into it. the camera draws back to show us stella, sitting by her vanity mirror. the rest of the room is reflected in the mirror, including the window we are upstairs. [note: it would be nice to see that fat moon floating in the window!] there's a framed picture of stella's ex boyfriend on the vanity beside the dish of pills. stella sets down the empty prescription bottle the pills came from beside this picture. we can clearly read the word "nembutol" on it. there is also a large glass of water on the vanity table. stella turns the picture facedown. she might be crying but probably she's not. she takes about five of the pills, starts to lift them to her mouth a howl outside... closer. stella looks around for a moment, then takes the pills with some water. she pauses, looking at herself.}
