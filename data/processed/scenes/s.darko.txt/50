<L>__{interior library, front desk afternoon}
<A>__{as chris and corey are on the way out, they notice jeremy frame at the counter checking out a stack of books. in putting them down, he accidentally drops half of them onto the floor. he looks frazzled as he begins to pick them up, and he scratches compulsively at his left forearm... i e. dusty's garage house afternoon chris and corey pull up to dusty's auto repair shop in chris' truck. they get out and start to walk up to the garage, but they're cut off by the unchained pit bull it's growling and barking in a frenzy }
<C>__{ruth }
<D>__{darielle!}
<A>__{the dog heels at the sound of the voice, and ruth bolts out of the house and takes her by the collar. she's got a bandage over a cut on her forehead.}
<C>__{ruth }
<D>__{come to check on your car?}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{yeah...}
<A>__{hearts still thumping in their chests, they follow ruth into the garage... corey's chevrolet is parked in the same spot it was when she left it the other day. the hood is propped open.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{randy's been a wreck since the accident.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{he should be. he was driving around shit faced and somebody got killed.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{you can just fuck off...}
<A>__{she gets right up in his face with such intensity that chris retreats a step or two.}
<C>__{ruth }
<D>__{prima donna motherfucker think your shit don't stink?}
<A>__{corey steps in:}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{she's right...}
<A>__{chris gives her a look.}
<C>__{corey }
<D>__{i mean, there's nothing randy could've done.}
<A>__{ruth turns and goes into the house through a garage entrance.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{i will get my dad.}
<A>__{the door slams shut behind her, and corey and chris glance at each other... momentarily, dusty comes out, a partially eaten sandwich in hand.}
<C>__{dusty}
<D>__{got some bad news for you...}
<A>__{he walks them over to the car, finishing off his sandwich and wiping his hands on his greasy jeans.}
<C>__{dusty }
<D>__{your engine seized up when your water pump blew.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{i need a new engine now?}
<C>__{dusty}
<D>__{i can get one in there for you. cost you about fifteen hundred.}
<A>__{corey's face drops.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{i don't have anywhere near that much money.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{that's probably as much as the car's worth.}
<C>__{dusty}
<D>__{i understand. but, i already ordered the water pump, and i will have to get paid for my time. that comes to about three hundred total.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{i don't have that much either.}
<A>__{dusty is perturbed.}
<C>__{dusty}
<D>__{you think i do this for charity?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{you didn't do anything. what's she want a water pump for if she doesn't have an engine?}
<C>__{dusty}
<D>__{i see how it is... couple a' punks. you don't plan to pay what you owe, you can get the hell off my property right now.}
<A>__{corey glares at him, furious, but chris takes her by the arm.}
<C>__{corey}
<P>__{(under her breath)}
<D>__{asshole.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{let's go...}
<A>__{i e. chris' truck motel afternoon chris' truck pulls up in front of the motel and parks. at the same time, father homeijer and trudy come out of the front office carrying a collections jar. as they approach the truck chris slowly rolls down the window.}
<C>__{father homeijer}
<D>__{good afternoon.}
<C>__{trudy}
<D>__{we're taking collections to help rebuild mount calvary after the tragic fire.}
<C>__{father homeijer}
<D>__{any small amount you could manage would really help.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{father homeijer and trudy look over to corey in the passenger seat but she just stares back at them.}
<C>__{father homeijer}
<D>__{god bless you.}
<A>__{they turn and walk away, and chris rolls his window back up.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{everybody wants somethin'...}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{what about you?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{you wouldn't give me stuff and drive me around if you didn't want something in return.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{`cause that's just not how it works.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{maybe you're wrong about that.}
<A>__{corey nods, but still doesn't believe him.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{see ya.}
<A>__{she gets out, and chris eyes her as she walks to her room.}
