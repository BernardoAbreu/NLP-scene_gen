<D>__{'are we there yet?' , are we there yet?' , you sound like a child. we're playing a hunch.}

<D>__{meeks' finger prints were all over the chiropractor, the note, refrigerator, he's the guy we should be looking for.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{look where? please tell me. everyone knows who meeks is and is looking for him. the chiropractor was the last link to his old life that i know of. the only way we'll find him, now, is if someone turns him in or we trip over him at a bus stop. on the other hand, detective snyder, no one knows who the thumbprint killer is or where he is. however, i have a fucking hunch this guy baffert does. i have two days to play that hunch. if you feel like you're wasting your time with me, i'd be happy to do it alone.}
