<L>__{interior smaller motel bedroom day}
<A>__{tied to the radiator, gagged with duct tape, is nadia. john looks down at her. she looks away as her eyes fill with tears. he sits on the bed facing her. they stay like that for a long moment before he reaches over and starts untying her knots. he peels the tape off her mouth. suddenly he slaps her across the face. her head hits the radiator. nadia gasps hard from the shock of the blow. without warning she slaps his face, equally hard. this starts a long silent fight; kicking, hitting, biting, a real struggle. its intensity is almost sexual, but has the edge of real violence. they end up on opposite sides of the room, both panting, hurt and beaten.}

<A>__{john lies there on the floor, panting, and he hears the english words. exhausted, john stands, wipes his mouth, and rushes her anew. nadia dodges out the way and cuffs him painfully on the ear. the whole fight starts again and ends only when neither has the strength to go on. nadia staggers into the bathroom where she shuts the door and begins to sob uncontrollably. john lies on the bed listening to her cry.}
