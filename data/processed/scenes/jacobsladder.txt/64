<A>__{gabe, on a bicycle, is rushing down the sidewalk. jacob is running alongside him, holding onto the seat. plastic streamers trail from the handlebars. gabe is a bit wobbly, but determined. after a couple of false starts, jacob lets go and gabe is riding by himself. for an instant, gabe looks back at his father with a huge grin on his face. jacob is grinning, too. the camera holds on gabe as he pulls away from us and heads into the distance.}
