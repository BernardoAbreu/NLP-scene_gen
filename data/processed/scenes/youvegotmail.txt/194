<D>__{don't.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i would have asked for your phone number and i wouldn't have been able to wait 24 hours before calling and asking, "how about coffee, drinks, dinner, a movie, for as long as we both shall live?"}

<A>__{kathleen looks at him. shakes her head. they look at each other.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{oh how i wish you would.}
<A>__{it's all kathleen can do not to forgive him. it's all joe can do not to kiss her.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{i really do have to go.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you don't want to be late.}
<A>__{she's in agony. he turns and walks away. after a moment, she does too.}
