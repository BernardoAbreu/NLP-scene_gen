<L>__{interior jail visiting area day}
<A>__{wayne gayle, a young, energetic, commando journalist a'la geraldo rivera is sitting on the visitor side of the county jail visiting area. wayne is alone and the visiting area is empty. apparently some arrangement was made for the visit. wayne has a miniature tape recorder in his hand and is testing it.}
<C>__{wayne}
<P>__{(into recorder)}
<D>__{testing one...two...three... testing...one...three...over, over, over, mickey knox meeting.}
<A>__{wayne shuts off the recorder, rewinds and plays it back. it works beautifully. he hits the record button and conceals the recorder in his sport coat jacket. the door opens on the prisoner side and mickey knox is lead into the room by two sheriff's deputies. mickey's wearing the country jail blue jump suit. he has a thick and wide leather belt around his waist with a metal ring built into each side. long sturdy chains with handcuffs on each end are wrapped across his body and through the rings, binding his arms to his sides. his hands and feet are double cuffed. the deputies both have their guns drawn, ready to blow mickey in half at the slightest provocation. for a man wrapped and bound in chains, mickey seems strangely in control of his environment. even restrained as he is by the symbols of society (the chains, jail, guards, guns, jump suit), he remains a dangerous, intimidating, and fascinating figure. wayne takes in the image of mickey.}
<C>__{wayne}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{showtime.}
<A>__{mickey's roughly shoved into his seat on the prisoner's side of the glass. the deputies move to their place, off to the side by the wall.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{hello mickey. we've never been introduced, but i'm wayne gayle. i don't know if you've ever heard of me or remember me. i was one of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial }
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{everybody knows who you are. you're famous.}
<A>__{wayne pauses and retorts.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{i could say the same thing about you.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i want to thank you very much for seeing me...}
<A>__{mickey is silent.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{i have a television show. it's very popular. every week we do a profile on a different serial killer. you don't mind if i call you a serial killer, do you?}
<A>__{mickey shakes his head no.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{the episode we did on mickey and mallory was one of our most popular ones.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{did you ever do one on wayne gacy?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{whose ratings were higher?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{yours.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{how 'bout ted bundy? ever do one on him?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{yes. yours got the larger nielson share.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{good...yuppie piece of shit.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{what i'd like to do }
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{how 'bout manson?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{manson beat you.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{we've been waiting to do a follow up episode on you for a long time. and that time has definitely come.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i feel it's apparent to anyone who's hip to what's going on that the prison board has thrown the constitution straight out the fuckin' window. you and mallory may be killers, but you're not insane. you belong in a prison, not in an asylum. the prison board is blatantly railroading you into a hospital for the sole purpose of turning you into vegetables. now some people are saying, 'so what?' i am not one of those people. if we avert our eyes while they do this to you, we give them permission to do it again whenever they see fit. today they wipe clean your mind because they feel your actions are dangerous, tomorrow they wipe clean my mind because they feel what i say is dangerous. where does it all stop?}
<A>__{no response from mickey.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{my problem mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. i'm all alone on this. i need your help. i want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. now i have interviews with chairman of the prison board dewight mcclusky about this issue. and i'm tellin' ya, mickey, he looks bad. the two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. i have an interview with both the judge of your trial, bert steinsma, and the psychologist and author, emil reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. you put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. but the network isn't satisfied. they feel the show needs another element. it needs you. in order to put the show on the air, i need to get an interview with you. you haven't talked to the press since your trial. now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with wayne gayle. we're talkin' a media event here. every son of a bitch out the with a tv set's gonna tune in to see that. we'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. at least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and mallory lobotomies. well, whatta ya say?}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{have you talked to mallory about this?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{she won't even see me, mickey. now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but i'm gonna tell ya somethin'. since you two've been sentenced, mallory hasn't spoken one word.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{she doesn't talk?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{not to anybody. she sings.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{she sings? what does she sing?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{songs. 'he's a rebel', 'leader of the pack', 'town without pity', that dusty springfield song 'i only want to be with you'. that's what i hear anyway. her behaviour was the main thing the doctors' report used against you. so even if she would see me, which she won't, i couldn't put her on camera anyway. if i ask her, 'mallory, are you insane?' and she starts singing 'dead skunk in the middle of the road', that blows our whole case.}
<A>__{mickey cracks a smile. the guards come over to take him away.}
<C>__{deputy sheriff }
<D>__{time, motherfucker!}
<A>__{they grab mickey, and jerk him from the chair. wayne stands.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{wait a minute, mickey, i need an answer.}
<A>__{mickey doesn't respond. he just leaves with the guards.}
<C>__{wayne}
<P>__{(yells after him)}
<D>__{just think about it. but don't think too long.}
