<L>__{interior lazarus' home night}
<A>__{r.l. crosses from the kitchen. he hands a glass of water to rae seated on the couch. he hands another to ronnie seated next to her. r.l. sits before them as laz lingers in the doorway.}
<C>__{r.l.}
<P>__{(to ronnie)}
<D>__{i imagine there's a lot of good between you two. but i want you to tell me what's bad. go'on. and don't hold back.}
<A>__{ronnie is very uncomfortable. he looks at rae seated next to him and then back at r.l..}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i hate this town. you can't round the corner without bumping into someone who's got your number.}
<P>__{(a brief look at rae)}
<D>__{we did a lot of dreamin', me and rae. makin' plans to get out. i'd do my tour and... we'd move outta here. go to chattanooga. and i'd work for my uncle.}
<P>__{(looks down, tears come to ronnie)}
<D>__{but... when rae gets like she does. and she does the things that she always done. makes me feel like she loves this place more'n me.}
<A>__{rae starts shaking her head, tears come to her eyes. r.l. raises a hand to silence her.}
<C>__{r.l.}
<D>__{go on, ronnie.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{all my life people called me shit like, sissy and... nervous and... i got few things in my life that make me feel like... like...}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{like a man.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{yes. i mean that's it. i wanna feel like a man with her. i wanna feel like the only man with her.}
<A>__{ronnie wipes the tears from his eyes with his shirt sleeve. r.l. turns to rae.}
<C>__{r.l.}
<P>__{(looks at rae)}
<D>__{now, rae, we're not here to fix you or judge you. only you and the almighty can do that. but i want you to tell me about these spells you get.}
<A>__{rae takes a deep breath. she looks up at laz. he encourages her with a nod.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{it starts like this... fire... that spreads. starts in my head. then moves to my stomach. then it goes lower. i can stop it sometimes but mostly i just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when i met ronnie.}
<P>__{(the emotion really hits hard)}
<D>__{cuz i love him so much. he's all i got in my life that's special. and i like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. when i can do that for him... it's like i'm givin' somethin' of myself that i haven't givin' nobody else.}
<C>__{r.l.}
<D>__{rae, look at ronnie. and tell him how you feel.}
<A>__{rae turns to ronnie. her nose is running as she wipes away her tears.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{i think... i think we're fucked up. both of us. i know i am. but... that don't mean what i feel ain't true. it don't mean i can't love. and i know, how i been is... is... really bad! so if you want to quit on me... i understand. but please... please... don't.}
<A>__{ronnie is very moved by rae's plea. he touches her face and wipes away a tear.}
<C>__{r.l.}
<D>__{so. what'chu two gonna do about this?}
