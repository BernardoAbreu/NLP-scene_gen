<P>__{(stiffly)}
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{there is an awkward pause. suddenly the screen door opens and c.w. comes out, dressed in his long underwear. blanche can hardly stand it.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{everybody, this is c.w. moss. c.w., my brother buck and his wife, blanche.}
<C>__{c.w.}
<P>__{(friendly)}
<D>__{heighdy, y'all.}
<A>__{he pumps buck's hand vigorously and then goes to blanche. with his characteristic one track intensity, he decides to act just as friendly as he can with blanche, ignoring the fact that he's standing there in his underwear. blanche, however, is not ignoring it.}
<C>__{c.w.}
<D>__{well how do, mrs. barrow. or can i call you blanch? i sure am pleased to meet you.}

<A>__{blanche is starting to edge over to buck in sheer panic at this strange, young man in his bvd's but c.w. takes no notice of it. blanche finally grabs buck's arm. bonnie watches it all, smirking.}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{hey, lemme get the kodak!}
<A>__{buck goes to his car and gets a folding brownie camera.}

<C>__{buck}
<D>__{y'all hear about the guy who thought western union was a cowboy's underwear?}

<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{lemme get one of my bride and my brother.}
<C>__{blanche}
<P>__{(getting kittenish, and overdoing it)}
<D>__{buck! don't take my picture now. i'm just a mess from driving all day.}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{oh honey, now you look real fine.}
<A>__{bonnie watches blanche's behavior with hardly veiled disgust. buck snaps the picture as blanche is just about to move out of it.}
<C>__{blanche}
<P>__{(with unbecoming girlish outrage)}
<D>__{did you take my picture? oh buck! i declare }
<A>__{buck laughs and goes to bonnie, takes her by the arm and moves her next to clyde and blanche. he lines them up, steps back and takes their picture. clyde is the only one smiling.}

<D>__{and posing like a}
