<A>__{the game has started. kirk, stainer, molly and patty are cheering. the puck smacks the glass before them and another player skates up for it. as he mucks it from the edge, he looks up and sees molly. he's distracted just long enough to get brutally checked face first into the glass. a penalty is called on the player who hit him. that player skates into the penalty box near molly. the name on his jersey reads, "reese." he speaks with a thick canadian accent.}
