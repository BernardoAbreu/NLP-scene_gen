<L>__{exterior abandoned metro city library night}
<A>__{amongst the jungle of high rises, one small building stands out from the rest a tiny, forgotten piece of 19th century gothic architecture. lightening flashes, revealing two concrete gargoyles holding a cracked plaque, reading: metro city library.}
<L>__{interior abandoned metro city library night}
<A>__{a mixture of old and new. dusty victorian furniture and dilapidated bookshelves sit side by side with pristinely futuristic machinery. the building has been converted into master mind's new secret}
<B>__{lair.}
<A>__{in the center of the main room is a three storey tall glowing blue orb. at the base of it is a sign that reads "reactor don't touch." we pan over to the reading room where master mind is sitting on a couch watching television.}
<C>__{reporter on television }
<D>__{it's been nearly six weeks, and still no word on the whereabouts of billionaire playboy, and philanthropist, wayne scott. tune in at 11:00 as we look into what has become metro city's biggest mystery.}
<C>__{television narrator }
<D>__{we now return to "the hero of our hearts: the uberman story."}
<A>__{einstein and plato come into the room holding a bag of loot.}
<C>__{einstein}
<D>__{just robbed the diamond exchange.}
<C>__{master mind}
<P>__{(feigning pleasure)}
<D>__{great, great. put it on the pile.}
<A>__{einstein tosses it on a large pile of purloined valuables in the corner of the room.}
<C>__{einstein}
<D>__{anything else today?}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{master mind turns his attention back to the screen. plato sees that master mind is in a funk and tries to snap him out of it.}
<C>__{plato}
<P>__{(cheerfully)}
<D>__{sir, the new reactor is installed.}
<A>__{plato nods to the giant orb.}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{do you want to throw the switch? i know how you love to start reactors.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{maybe later.}
<A>__{einstein gives master mind a funny look then exchanges glances with plato before leaving the two of them alone. without turning away from the tv, master mind addresses plato.}
<C>__{master mind }
<D>__{what is it, plato?}
<C>__{plato}
<P>__{(nervously)}
<D>__{sir, i can't help but notice that you've been...a little down lately.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{when i want your opinion i will beat it out of you.}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{yes, sir, i know, but please forgive my impertinence. it's just that you seem to have lost your lust for our profession. you've stopped going on jobs and spend most of your time watching uberman specials.}
<A>__{master mind relaxes slightly and turns to face the window in a classically contemplative pose. after an overdramatic beat...}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{i have defeated my greatest enemy. i have free reign over metro city. i have more wealth than a thousand sultans. i've achieved all i have worked for...so why am i so unhappy?}
<A>__{he walks over to a painted portrait that looks almost exactly like him, except slightly older, maybe meaner master mind's}
<B>__{father.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{i mean, my father, god rest his evil and tormented soul, raised me straight from the test tube to be a symbol of evil.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{and, i have accomplished something he had only dreamed about the destruction of metro city's champion. i tell you, i've always lived with this unquenchable thirst. i thought it was to make him proud or to get absolute power. but now that i've pretty much accomplished both, i am at a loss.}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{...i sort of have a theory about all that.}
<C>__{master mind}
<P>__{(snippy)}
<D>__{oh, really?}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{well, for one thing, maybe uberman was more important to you than you thought.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{he was a worthy rival. sometimes i wonder, did he consider me his evil equal or was i just an annoying, little gnat to him? ...what's the second part?}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{i think you sort of have a thing for roxanne ritchi.}
<A>__{master mind quickly takes his lackey by the throat.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{you worm! how dare you! where would you get such a notion?}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{sir, your plans always involve ms. ritchi either being kidnapped or placed in danger. if that's not love, i don't know what is. it's the grown up equivalent of dipping her pigtails in the ink well. don't you see? she's the one treasure that's always escaped you.}
<A>__{from master mind's expression, we see plato's words beginning to ring true.}
