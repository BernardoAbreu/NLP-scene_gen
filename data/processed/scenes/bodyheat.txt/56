<L>__{exterior driving range night}
<A>__{a dozen golfers are practicing, spotted along the row of hitting pads under floodlights. most are drenched with sweat from their exertion in the muggy air. their randomly timed swings send streaking white bullets into the darkness. but what is hypnotic, what so captures a hot night in sound, is the irregular cracking of clubs meeting balls: crack, crack crack crack, crack crack! in the darkness of the overlooking parking lot, behind a high fence, sits the stingray, with racine in the driver's seat and matty close beside him. they sit in silence.}

<P>__{(finally)}
<D>__{what are we doing here?}
<C>__{racine}
<P>__{(hushed)}
<D>__{listen!}
<P>__{(crack, crack)}
<D>__{i love that sound.}
<A>__{matty listens, but her eyes are on racine.}

<C>__{matty}
<D>__{i want to be in bed.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{is that all you ever think about?}
<A>__{racine watches the golfers, listening intently. then he sees that matty is crying. he comforts her.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{hey! i'm kidding.}
<A>__{matty looks straight ahead and her tone is somber.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{yes ... that's all i ever think about ... you and me. your body near mine, close. i'm not right when you're not with me. i get the shakes. and each time, when i first see you, i shake even more. for a while. and then i get calm. i feel safe ... i've never been this way. i can't remember how i lived before.}
<A>__{he knows it's true. it's the same for him. he wipes her cheeks with his hand. crack, crack crack, crack.}
