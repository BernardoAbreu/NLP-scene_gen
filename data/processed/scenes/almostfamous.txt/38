<A>__{penny waist by her car, down the hill, sporting a different more elegant look. she cups her hands and yells up to him. he hikes down the hill, squishing down the water plants, almost falling, the first time we've seen him happy in his own skin.}
<L>__{exterior sunset boulevard later night}
<A>__{miss penny lane's yellow vega makes the big swing onto sunset boulevard. she sings along to the obscure words of led zeppelin's "dancing days." william takes it all in from the passenger seat. huge billboards advertise not cigarettes or beer, but albums. it's a wondrous piece of geography for any rock fan. shot moves in as william, watches, takes it all in. he moves his head outside the window to see fully. her windshield is cracked along the side.}

<P>__{(does tour guide voice)}
<D>__{every band stays here, all the ones that matter. the who. zeppelin. alice. bowie. english bands. american bands. we all know each other. twenty four hour room service. like us, they were outsiders. they were so outside, they're inside, and insiders never even knew it, because they're outsiders and they are inside a place outsiders will never be. and why are we even talking about it? if you're really an insider, you're never gonna say it. you know what i mean?}
