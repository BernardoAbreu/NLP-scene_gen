<L>__{exterior sky desert wasp (in flight) dusk}
<A>__{high above the tarantula. gordon, lost in the joy of flight, turns to west who is more of a white knuckler.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{i think i will call it...}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{lemme guess... an elevation enhancer?}
<C>__{gordon}
<P>__{(why would you call it that?)}
<D>__{no, air... gordon.}
<A>__{now west points to the tarantula and chaos below.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{go down, down there!}
<C>__{gordon}
<P>__{(as if to a child)}
<D>__{you can't just 'go down there.' flight depends on lift, which must be calibrated to the angle of descent...}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{shut up and go down there, will ya?}
<A>__{west reaches up, shoves the make shift joystick forward. as the wasp plummets toward the bridge of the tarantula and gordon strains to keep control...}
