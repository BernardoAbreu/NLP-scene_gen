<L>__{interior restaurant night}
<A>__{three people sit around a table awkwardly. julian, jenna and mai (dressed very conservatively) all eating soup. a long silence.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{so... may, isn't it?}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{it's mai, mum.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{how long have you two known each other then?}
<A>__{mai's about to answer but juilan gets there first.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{a year and a half isn't it?}
<A>__{beat as mai quickly counts in her head...}
<C>__{mai}
<D>__{...that sounds about right.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{well it's always a rare treat to meet one of julian's lady friends.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{mum, please...}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{so, where did you two meet?}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{i saw her walking down the street.}
<A>__{jenna raises an eyebrow...}
<C>__{julian }
<D>__{and i thought this is the most beautiful girl i've ever seen so i just walked up to her and started talking.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{i hear that happens a lot in this part of the world... tell me, what's your line of work, mai?}
<C>__{mai}
<D>__{i work in the service industry.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{i bet you do. but tell me mai, before you started serving my son, how many cocks were you serving? was it over a thousand?}
<A>__{mai stares at jenna in disbelief.}
<C>__{jenna }
<D>__{i know girls like you. just because you might be pulling the wool over my son's eyes don't think it's going to work with me.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{mum, stop it, for fuck's sake.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{i'm sorry julian, but i won't stand by and let a dirty little hooker take advantage of my son in the vain hope that her womb isn't so diseased that she can trick him into impregnating her and putting another cocksucking child on to this earth.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{leave her alone mum. you've got her wrong. she's a good girl.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{what do you know about what's good?}
<A>__{beat. julian says nothing.}
<C>__{mai}
<D>__{he's good to me...}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{well that's nice isn't it, i'm really happy for you }
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{mum!}
<A>__{a pause.}
<C>__{julian }
<D>__{the cops came by my club today.}
<A>__{beat. she stares at him.}
<C>__{julian }
<D>__{they're investigating a murder. the guy that killed billy turned up dead this morning.}
<A>__{jenna looks bored. lights a cigarette.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{oh really, shame that, still, live by the sword, die by the sword...}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{i know it was you, mum.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{i did what had to be done.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{he was there. he was with them.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{the angel of vengeance.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{d'you kill him?}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{cause he as good as killed billy. what i want to know is, what are you going to do about it?}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{i'm not going to kill him...}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{yes you are. you're going to do it for me and you're going to do it for your brother.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{this isn't about billy. this is about me. all my life i've been running...}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{that's right you cunt, cause you always run away whenever there's a problem... just like you're running away from killing this fucking angel of whatever }
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{ his name is chang }
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{chang?!}
<A>__{mai stands up.}
<C>__{mai}
<D>__{i should be going now.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{sit down you cunt.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{mum, don't talk to her like that.}
<A>__{mai sits down.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{so what am i left with?}
<A>__{julian stares at her.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{me.}
<A>__{jenna calms down. she looks at their reflections in the mirror behind the bar. we zoom in on the mirror, their faces refracted by the glass.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{you're right. we're family. we stick together. but billy was family too.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{billy was a fuck up... he deserved everything he got. you know it and i know it.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{that's it. i'm not listening to this. i don't ever want to hear you mention his name again... do you hear me?}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{yeah we were brothers, but we were never close... and he was only in bangkok cause you couldn't control him. so you sent him to me }
<C>__{julian }
<D>__{ so you sent him to me and what could i do?}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{you could have protected him.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{i did what i could. and that's more than you ever did.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{i would've done anything for him. okay, he wasn't born with as many advantages as you were. he struggled with things. but i always stood by him.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{and what did that get him? i will tell you what, a one way ticket to this fucking place, just like me.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{don't you dare blame me for what happened back then.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{i'm only here 'cause of you. if you didn't exist, i wouldn't be here.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{julian }
<D>__{i could've been someone, mum. i was on my way...}
<A>__{jenna stares at him this is a conversation she does not like having...}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{you would've been a great fighter... you could've gone pro.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{don't you think i know that? and look at me now. i'm a front for a drugs smuggling.}
<A>__{he turns to mai.}
<C>__{julian }
<D>__{it's true... the whole thing's a front. every day i see kids coming in with great potential. and every day i see kilos of heroin going out. and it's all because of you, ma. you and the money and the drugs.}
<A>__{jenna silently seethes, waiting for julian to shut the fuck up. he quietens down...}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{at least you're not behind bars and that's more important to me.}
<A>__{julian turns to her he has been waiting all his life to say this.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{that's right mum. that's what's more important to you. but what about me? sometimes i think you only got me out of there so the cops couldn't trace it back to you...}
<A>__{jenna stares at him. her face a mask.}
<C>__{julian }
<D>__{...that's right mum. think about it. with me gone you were safe. and it turned out to be good for business as well. all very convenient.}
<A>__{silence between them. jenna lights another cigarette her hands now shaking.}
<C>__{julian }
<D>__{is that what happened with billy? did billy become a problem like i did? wouldn't surprise me, he was a big fucking problem when he was here... still, at least you didn't have him killed.}
<A>__{jenna slaps him hard on the face. julian recovers. looks up at her. very intense.}
<C>__{julian }
<D>__{i'm not going to kill him for you, mum. doesn't matter what you say. and do you want to know why?}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{surprise me.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{'cause i'm going to fight him. in the ring. me versus him.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{well that seems sensible... and what do you hope that's going to achieve?}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{i don't expect you to understand. cause you don't understand anything that isn't about you.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{and when you lose, what's going to happen then?}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{i don't know... but maybe this time i will win. like you say, only god forgives. maybe this time he'll forgive me...}
<A>__{jenna turns to mai.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{do you understand what he's talking about? 'cause i haven't got a fucking a clue.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{you never did, mum.}
<A>__{a pause. julian's touched a nerve. jenna recovers.}
<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{i hope you find what you're looking for. 'cause if you don't, it's going to find you and i'm not always going to be there to look after you.}
<A>__{jenna composes herself. suddenly brightens. a different person.}
<C>__{jenna }
<D>__{nice to meet you mai. hope to see you again soon.}
<A>__{jenna shakes her hand. mai's too shocked to resist. and then, as if nothing had happened, jenna leaves. julian covers his face with his napkin.}
<C>__{mai}
<D>__{are you alright?}
<A>__{he's not. he's crying. but he doesn't want anyone to see.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{i'm fine.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{julian }
<D>__{i will be fine. in a minute.}
<A>__{julian wipes his face clean. pulls himself together.}
<C>__{julian }
<D>__{sorry about that.}
