<A>__{what remains of chris' travelling money burns in a pile beside the datsun on the sun lit but muddy desert floor. we follow a very long set of footprints (camera tracking true vertical) away from the burning cash through the mud, finally tilting up to the footprint maker, chris. slogging toward high ground. wide shot: we see the abandoned datsun nearly a mile behind chris as he walks toward us wearing his backpack. he comes very close to camera (only a day or two's stubble on his face) and as we pan him 180, we see as much wilderness before us as we did behind.}
