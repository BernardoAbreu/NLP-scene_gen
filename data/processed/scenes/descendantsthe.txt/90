<D>__{i don't know. take them out, stupid.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{yeah, scottie. honestly. big boobs look kind of fatty.}
<A>__{scowling, scottie gets up and starts pulling the sand out of her suit as she stomps toward the water.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{any luck?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{the hotels were a dead end, but i took another shot with his office. he's definitely in hanalei renting a house somewhere probably one of those cottages around the bay. who wants to go for a walk?}
<C>__{sid}

<A>__{matt grimaces not whom he was hoping for. alex ties the straps of her bikini and flips over.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{yeah, let's go. scottie!}

<D>__{scottie, we're not really here to do stuff like that.}
