<L>__{interior the celestial eddie's living room night}
<A>__{eddie sits at his huge new steel dining table, the evil box on the table in front of him, head in his hands. (the room is filled with labeled boxes he has never had a chance to unpack.) the tv is on in the background. it's a financial channel. we see mrs. hank atwood is giving a statement.}
<C>__{mrs. hank atwood}
<D>__{there is absolutely no truth to the rumor of this merger. none whatsoever. my husband is having some tests, this is a difficult time, and i would appreciate your directing further questions to our attorney...}
<A>__{she motions at the gentleman next to her. who is also eddie's attorney, morris brandt. the one who was so helpful with the police. the one who held his jacket. bitter amusement in eddie's eyes. at least he knows. the apartment buzzer buzzes. eddie freezes. looks at the door. it buzzes again.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{it wasn't downstairs security, alerting me to a visitor. eddie (v.0.) (cont'd) it was my inner door. someone was in the building, ten feet away, right now.}
<A>__{eddie walks to his phone, picks it up. pushes the button, puts it to his ear. it's dead. he pushes the "on" button again and again. nothing. the buzzer buzzes again. eddie rushes to the door, opens the coat closet. in the closet is a state of the art security monitor. gennady and two men are outside his door! suddenly the monitor goes black. eddie flicks the switch on the monitor. nothing. eddie flicks the switch again. it's dead. someone, somewhere, has figured out how to disarm it. the buzzer buzzes again. eddie backs away from the door. we hear eddie's shallow, panicked breathing. he lunges for his briefcase, pulls out his cell phone. the cell phone close it reads "no signal." bam! the first slam on the door begins. bam! the second. the door holds, but eddie begins to back away in horror. bam! we slowly fade to black: . and fade in on:}
