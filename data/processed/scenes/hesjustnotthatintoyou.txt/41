<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i was with damon for six years. he asked me to marry him on the phone, because he's just so different and cool like that. said he'd eventually get me a ring, which he didn't, but he did buy himself a ring because isn't that so hilarious and cool that the guy is wearing the ring? then, my favorite part is, i stayed with him even after he took back his proposal, and introduced the idea of a "relation vacation." isn't that a cute name? let me explain the concept: it involves dating a girl from the time she's thirty two to the time she's thirty nine, possibly robbing her of the ability to bear children, and then, after all that, wanting to take a year off. and giving it a fun name that you can put on t shirts.}
