<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{something like that.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{hey, it works for me. if they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable...}
<A>__{buffy sits, squints disapprovingly at the screen. she has a bag of microwave lite popcorn and is spraying diet butter substitute on it.}

<D>__{what show is this?}

<C>__{jeffrey}

<A>__{he starts kissing her about the face and neck. she leans submissively back on the couch as he works his way on top of her. he gives her a long kiss on the mouth, then works over to her ear. as he is burrowing about in there, buffy sneaks another handful of popcorn into her mouth. she leans back, by accident, on the remote. angle the tv "dracula" reappears.}
