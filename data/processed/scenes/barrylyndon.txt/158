<D>__{whereas, young brookside had grown to be a very nasty and disrespectful fellow indeed. in my company, he preserved the most rigid silence, and a haughty, scornful demeanor, which was so much the more disagreeable because there was nothing in his behavior i could actually take hold of to find fault with, although his whole conduct was insolent and supercilious to the highest degree.}
