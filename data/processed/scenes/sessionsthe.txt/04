<L>__{exterior street outside mark's. night}
<A>__{it is about 4.00 a.m. all is quiet. we follow a mean looking alley cat to the front of a modest, ground floor apartment. it pauses, then slinks round the side, onto a ledge and in through a partially opened window.}
<L>__{interior mark's place. night}
<A>__{the cat comes through the window, hops onto the floor and quickly finds a nice little plate of food scraps that has been set out specially. as it settles down to its meal, we become aware of a heavy and regular sound, like a ship's pump, coming from somewhere close by. in the center of the room is an object that looks like a prop from a `50s sci fi movie. a human head protrudes from one end. the object is an iron lung, and its purpose is to keep its occupant, mark o'brien, breathing. every 4.5 seconds, the pump mechanism creates a vacuum inside, forcing mark's chest to expand and suck in air. he is fast asleep.}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{breathing look you this most excellent canopy, the air, presses down upon me at 15 pounds per square inch a dense, heavy, blue glowing ocean. teasing me with its nearness and immensity. and all i get is a thin stream of it. a finger's width of the rope that ties me to life.}
<A>__{having now eaten its fill, the cat has a good scratch, then wanders over to the iron lung. it hops up onto the small platform that supports mark's head and slides itself along his face, once this way, once the other way, then jumps on top of the iron lung and walks its length. through the portholes, we just make out the shape of mark's bent, undersize body. suddenly, mark's nose twitches. he opens his eyes and grimaces.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{his face continues to contort as he tries to cope with the terrible itching. he shakes his head violently, then stops suddenly and closes his eyes. we hear his thoughts.}
<D>__{mark (v.o.) (cont'd) okay, just focus. now, scratch with your mind, okay, your mind, scratch with your mind...}
<A>__{after a couple more nose twitches, he settles down. it seems to have worked. in his peripheral vision, mark can see the cat making itself comfortable in a corner chair, one of the only other pieces of furniture in the room. the first hints of dawn start to appear through the curtains. they illuminate a large framed portrait of the virgin mary hanging on the wall. mark acknowledges it.}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{good morning.}
<A>__{sunlight streams in, making the picture look truly sacred.}
