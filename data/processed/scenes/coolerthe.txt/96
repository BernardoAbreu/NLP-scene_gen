<L>__{interior casino floor craps tables night}
<A>__{shelly exits the men's room, makes his way back to the craps table where bernie is. just in time to see bernie lay twenty five grand on the pass line. a waitress hands a drink off to bernie. he takes a healthy swig. then picks up the dice. throws.}
<C>__{stickman}
<D>__{crap ace deuce! line down!}
<A>__{the crowd gasps in horror as bernie's twenty five grand is quickly raked in. he replaces it with another stack of chips. the dice are pushed over to him. he rubs the felt real gently before throwing. then lets loose the dice. all eyes follow the dice. they hit the felt and bounce around behind a stack of chips. the stickman can't spot them.}
<C>__{stickman}
<D>__{call it.}
<A>__{a croupier makes the call as anxious players rubberneck to get a look.}
<C>__{croupier}
<D>__{twelve crap.}
<A>__{the crowd groans again. it appears the streak is over. bernie looks out over the felt. this is his moment of truth. he unloads his entire rail and puts it on the field. he yells out.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{fifty thousand dollars!}
<A>__{the crowd chimes in with every opinion under the sun.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{on the field? what're you fucking nuts?}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{don't do it!}
<C>__{man 2 }
<D>__{shake it, don't break it, baby!}
<A>__{the dice are slowly pushed over to bernie. the crowd is feeling it. the entire casino is feeling it. bernie lets out a long soulful sigh. his whole life depends on the next throw and everyone knows it. bernie rubs the felt as usual and lines up the dice to show a six and a six. he picks them up.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{come on sixty six!}
<A>__{locks eyes with shelly then lets loose. the dice fly from his hand. slowly, ever so slowly we watch them sail across the table. the entire table holds their breath in anticipation...}
