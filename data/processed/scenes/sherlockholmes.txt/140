<L>__{interior parliament lord coward's chambers}
<A>__{the door is opened by lord coward, who's halfway through putting on his official robes, and caught off guard by the sight of holmes cuffed (hands behind him) and flanked by lestrade and men.}
<C>__{lord coward}
<D>__{lestrade?}
<C>__{lestrade}
<D>__{begging your pardon, m'lord, i know it's unorthodox, but mr. holmes has been making serious accusations about you and the order, sir.}
<A>__{lestrade pulls his lapel, revealing a temple of four orders pin.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{oh, that solves the great mystery as to how you became inspector.}
<A>__{lestrade punches holmes.}
<C>__{lord coward}
<D>__{i have five minutes before my next engagement, why don't you regale me with your stories of conspiracies. thank you, lestrade, if you could wait outside.}
<A>__{lestrade leaves and shuts the door.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i'm curious, coward, did you assist blackwood in all the murders or just the one i prevented? very distinctive those hand made shoes of yours, but the price of quality is the unique imprint they leave.}
<A>__{coward walks towards his desk at one end of the room. holmes goes to warm himself by the fire at the other end.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{nonetheless, i confess to being completely out matched. i could deduce very little from my investigation.}
<A>__{coward turns away for a moment holmes subtly kicks a log from the fire, it starts to smolder and fill the room with smoke.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{fortunately, there is nothing more stimulating than a case where everything goes against you. how many members of parliament do you intend to murder at noon today?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{man, ox, eagle, lion the lion is parliament, isn't it?}
<A>__{lord coward slows, looks at holmes in some astonishment.}
<C>__{lord coward}
<D>__{very clever. but it's not murder, mr. holmes. it's mercy. we are giving the weak masses a strong shepherd. don't you see it's for their own good?}
<A>__{smoke fills the room so that holmes is concealed. coward pulls a gun from the desk and moves to the window. he opens it to try and clear the smoke.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{no, but i don't care much what you think. i simply wanted to know the location of blackwood's final ceremony, and now you have given it to me.}
<C>__{lord coward}
<D>__{i have told you nothing.}
<A>__{a pair of handcuffs, slide across the floor to coward's feet. he looks up and holmes is nowhere to be found. coward quickly moves across the room to lock the door.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{but your clothes say infinitely more than you ever hope. the mud smeared on your boots from where you've been walking...}
<A>__{closeup on coward's clothes that he's changed out of and discarded in the corner of the room. we see a }
<B>__{series of flashbacks}
<A>__{coward's heel walking through mud.}
<C>__{holmes }
<D>__{a touch of red stock brick dust on your knee, from where you've been kneeling...}
<A>__{coward's knee dropping to the ground.}
<C>__{holmes }
<D>__{a small bandage on your thumb from where you've been vowing...}
<A>__{coward performing a ritual.}
<C>__{holmes }
<D>__{a faint aroma of excrement, from where you have been standing.}
<A>__{coward, blackwood, and the temple members perform a ritual around a pentagram in the sewers. the big ceremonial sword is prominent.}
<C>__{lord coward }
<D>__{it's a shame you made an enemy out of blackwood, holmes, you would have made a valuable ally. the powers at our disposal are far greater than you can imagine.}
<C>__{holmes }
<D>__{you and blackwood laid the final touches to your ceremony in the sewers beneath parliament less than an hour ago. 94a 94b. holmes (v.o.) (cont'd) both houses met today. the entire government will be present.}
<C>__{lord coward}
<D>__{how terrible is wisdom, holmes, when it brings no profit to the wise.}
