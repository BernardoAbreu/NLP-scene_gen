<A>__{saul is sitting against the wall with his hands bound and a look of complete defeat. suddenly, the door opens and dale is tossed in by budlofsky.}

<D>__{tell ya what, dale. you actually save me and i will consider forgiving you for this mad shit.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{good. `cause i will.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{oh really? what, you forget to tell me you shoot lasers out of your eyes, or you got some kind of secret blowtorch strapped to your dick? we're not gonna escape, dale, we're losers, and sinners, and after we die, we're gonna go to hell!}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{we're not losers! we did that car chase. that was all you, man! you got away from the cops. i've watched, like, nine billion hours of worlds wildest police chases and i've never seen a guy get away. not once! but you did it. you did the impossible.}

<C>__{matheson}
<D>__{we can hear you out there, and it's annoying. shut the fuck up.}
<A>__{he looks dale and saul up and down, then shuts the door. dale sits down and thinks, but is disturbed by his belt buckle, which is digging into his gut.}
<C>__{dale}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{perfect! now rub your wrists against my belt! my belt buckle'll cut the tape. do it! this is it!}
<A>__{saul is hesitant, but awkwardly gets in position anyway.}
<C>__{dale }
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{hurry!}
<A>__{in an unavoidably sexual looking motion, saul begins to gyrate against dale's belt buckle.}
<C>__{dale }
<P>__{(hushed)}
<D>__{yes! yes! you know what this is called, saul? this is called saving you.}
