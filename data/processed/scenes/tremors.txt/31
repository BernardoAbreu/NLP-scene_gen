<L>__{exterior shack day}
<A>__{val and earl, sobered and deep in thought, drive past the shack where the ferocious dog lives. they automatically roll up their windows during:}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{reckon he hated perfection more than us? you suppose he wanted to kill himself?}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{if he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst? come on, sombody must've chased him up there.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{oh, you mean somebody who ain't scared of a twelve gauge shotgun. and then what did they do? camp out down below and just wait for him to die?}
<A>__{val has no answer. it's too weird.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{well, whatever the hell happened it's just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{you got that right.}
<A>__{they are passing the shack. earl suddenly realizes:}
<C>__{earl }
<D>__{hey, where the hell's that asshole dog?}
<C>__{val}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{probably up a pole starving itself to death.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way. we don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{i will go with that plan.}
