<L>__{exterior the motel (day)}
<A>__{lila comes along the porch, pauses before cabin one, tries the door. it opens. she closes it quickly as she hears sam and norman coming out of the motel office, continues on down the porch.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(to norman, who is following)}
<D>__{don't bother yourself... we'll find it.}
<A>__{he goes on down the porch, doesn't even glance at cabin one, walks quickly and catches up to lila just as she reaches cabin twelve. camera remains with norman, who is standing by the office door, looking after sam and lila, his face alert and no longer impassive. he waits a moment, after they have closed their cabin door, then crosses to the pickup truck. camera moves with him. he studies the truck, then leans in through the driver's window, twists the registration card around, reads it. it gives the correct name and address of sam loomis. norman comes back out of the window, glances once more toward cabin twelve, then at the old house. his suspicions are confirmed, and now there is the relaxation of relief in his face. he takes on a purposeful air, turns, strides up the path, up onto the porch of the house, opens the door, goes in.}
