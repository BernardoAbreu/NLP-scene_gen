<L>__{exterior the blackwood estate establishing day}
<A>__{judging by the estate, blackwood comes from old money, and lots of it. we follow the carriage hurrying holmes and watson forward.}
<L>__{exterior the blackwood burial plot day}
<A>__{generations of wealth buried in moss covered marble memorials. not a place for a picnic, not even on a bright sunny day and it's starting to rain. a cop stops the carriage, opens the door. holmes and watson exit, watson carries a black leather forensics}
<B>__{kit.}
<A>__{they walk up the pathway towards the blackwood family crypt. watson barely lifts his head, scanning the ground while holmes appears to have taken an interest in a clump of trees in the distance.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{look at this mess. nothing but standard issue police bootprints. any possible evidence there might have been has been trampled.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{scotland yard at their finest, once again.}
<A>__{police lamps light one large marble crypt. the cops are in tight clusters, whispering to themselves, spooked. they'd rather be anywhere but here. as holmes and watson approach, they see the marble doors of the crypt have been blasted open from the inside. holmes and watson share a quick glance this is interesting. lestrade emerges from the crypt. he is sweating, shaken. holmes offers lestrade his handkerchief, lestrade waves it off.}
<C>__{lestrade}
<D>__{look at those slabs of marble they're half a ton each if they're a pound smashed outward like they were nothing.}
<A>__{on second thought, lestrade does take holmes' handkerchief.}
<C>__{lestrade}
<D>__{explain it if you can, holmes.}
<A>__{holmes inspects the door, checking the hinges. he notices the blackwood crest, and the image of a sphinx.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{and the coffin?}
<C>__{lestrade}
<D>__{we're digging it up now. the witness is over there. you can question him if you like but you won't get much.}
<A>__{the old groundskeeper, pale and terrified, stands out of the rain under an ancient cypress tree. watson heads for him. holmes disappears in the opposite direction. as soon as their backs are turned, lestrade marches over to a nervous knot of cops, grabs a fistful of blue in each hand, drags his boys in close. he doesn't want holmes or watson to hear this.}
<C>__{lestrade}
<P>__{(low, angry)}
<D>__{if you lot don't stop behaving like a bunch of superstitious milk maids, you're on double time! you're an embarrassment! also, you're forbidden to talk about this to anyone, not a word. are we bloody clear on that?}
<A>__{the cops nod, duly chastened.}
