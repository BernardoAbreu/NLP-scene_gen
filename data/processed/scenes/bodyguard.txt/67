<A>__{rachel approaches the end of her song, her voice coming ever stronger. spector comes up to frank in the wings, positioning himself combatively between frank and his view of rachel.}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{are we having a communications problem here?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{spector's presence is a distraction. frank steps to one side for a better view of rachel. spector moves too.}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{apparently, i didn't make it clear to you how things go around here.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you told me you were going to tell her. and you didn't.}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{i didn't think she could handle it.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{but she handled it fine.}
<A>__{frank continues to peer past spector's shoulder, his vigilance undiminished. soothed and nurtured by the obvious admiration of her audience, rachel's fear is beginning to vanish. the song is taking over. spector changes tack, becoming confidential, "man to man."}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{look. frank, i know what you're saying. i know you want to do what's best for her. i understand that. you have a job to do here. but you have to understand that rachel has a job to do too. and that's what she's doing out there. she's working, frank. that's what she does and that's where she does it. she's hot right now. this is the time for her. if she doesn't get out there, she's dead. forget about crazy death threats, if she doesn't sing, she's dead anyway... look, handled properly, this thing could be good for a million dollars' worth of free publicity.}
<A>__{frank grabs him by the collar and slams him up against a wall of curtain ropes.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{one word.}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{it could clinch her the nomination.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{one word in print about any of this...}
<A>__{spector nods, half gasping. frank tightens his grip. frank's attention is drawn by a renewed roar from the crowd.}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{trouble with you is you don't understand the sympathy vote.}
