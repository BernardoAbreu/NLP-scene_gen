<A>__{johnny utah trudging across the sand, holding his shoes. garment bag and a big duffel over his shoulder. he looks silly in his dark suit, tie loosened, wearing a turned around baseball cap. he wiggles his toes in the sand, looks around like a kid. a pack of bouncing beauties jog through frame. utah grins, reaches up and turns his cap around. it reads "i love l.a."}
