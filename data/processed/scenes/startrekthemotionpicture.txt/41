<L>__{30's; scott, and two technicians. decker and scott}
<A>__{are working feverishly uncoupling the device, probing its innards. decker has discovered the problem, removed several transistor type parts, taps them with a pencil sized sonic analyzer.}
<C>__{decker}
<P>__{(quietly elated)}
<D>__{i thought so! see... the trans porter sensor was not activated...}
<C>__{scott}
<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{aye, you were dead right about that...}
<P>__{(to technician)}
<D>__{clearly, put a back up sensor into the unit.}
<B>__{across them to kirk}
<A>__{as the technician prepares to install the device, scott glances up to see kirk. he looks from decker to kirk in acute embarrassment (so that we should realize scott hasn't mentioned kirk's taking over to decker). decker now notices kirk, reacts pleased.}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{admiral kirk...}
<P>__{(shakes kirk's hand)}
<D>__{we're getting a top brass send off...?}
<P>__{(self assured grin)}
<D>__{she'll launch on schedule if we have to tow her out with our bare hands. right, scotty?}
<C>__{scotty}
<P>__{(lamely)}
<D>__{aye, sir, that we will...}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(to decker)}
<D>__{will, let's go over here and talk.}
<A>__{he indicates corner. decker glances bemusedly at kirk, then turns to scott:}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{let me now when the back up is in place.}
<B>__{across scott to kirk and decker}
<A>__{as scott ad libs a glum "aye, sir," and watches them walk across the chamber.}
<B>__{a corner of the intermix chamber}
<A>__{just a little quieter here, with kirk and decker arriv ing, and decker saying blithely:}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{all due respect, sir, i hope this isn't a starfleet pep talk; i'm just too busy.}
<A>__{kirk eyes decker then decides the best way to say it is plainly, directly.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i'm taking over the center seat. i'm sorry, will.}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{you are what...?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i'm replacing you as captain of the enterprise.}
<A>__{decker seems shocked into silence; he can only peer at kirk who reaches tentatively as though to clasp a paternal hand on decker's shoulder, then withdraws it and continues quickly.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you'll stay aboard as executive officer... a temporary grade reduction to commander.}
<C>__{decker}
<P>__{(finding his voice)}
<D>__{ you, personally, are assuming command?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{may i ask why?}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{my experience five years out there dealing with unknowns like this my familiarity with the enterprise, this crew...}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{admiral, this is an almost totally new enterprise. you don't know her a tenth as well as i do.}
<A>__{another angle to show scott in b.g. (across the room) scott, working on the relay, but continually glancing at kirk and decker with worried concern, as kirk replies:}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{that's why you're staying aboard. i'm sorry, will.}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{no, admiral. i don't think you are; not one damned bit. i remember when you recommended me for this command. you told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. well, sir, it looks like you found a way.}
<A>__{kirk is silent a moment, peering levelly at decker, who returns the gaze with equal intensity. then:}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{report to the bridge, commander. immediately.}
<A>__{decker exits. kirk waits, collecting his composure as he watches him go. then kirk turns to glare at scott. interrupted by a flare as something shorts out at the mechanism where scott and decker had been working. technician (clearly) reacts, hits an inter com button fast:}
<C>__{technician }
<D>__{transporter room, come in! urgent!}
<P>__{(to scott)}
<D>__{redline on the transporters, mister scott!}
<A>__{scott whirls to a console fast, speaks urgently!}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{transporter room, do not engage! do not....}
<C>__{technician }
<P>__{(reacting to the reading; interruption)}
<D>__{too late; they're beaming now!}
<A>__{kirk is exiting on a run, followed by scott.}
