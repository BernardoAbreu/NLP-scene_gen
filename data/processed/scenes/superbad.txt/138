<L>__{interior jules' staircase moments later}
<A>__{nicola leads fogell up the stairs.}
<C>__{nicola}
<D>__{i can't believe i'm about to get with "fogell".}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{nicola}
<D>__{i don't know. you're like, the most mysterious guy in the grade. like, nobody knows anything about you.}
<C>__{fogell}
<D>__{well, you're about to learn a few things.}
<L>__{exterior jules' front porch continuous}
<A>__{jules and seth step out onto the front porch. there is no one else out there. the moment the door closes behind them, seth turns to jules and puts his hands on her hips. he stares into her eyes and moves in for the kiss. jules instantly pulls back.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{whoa! whoa! slow down.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{what? what's wrong?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{i'd...uh...prefer if we did this at some other time.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{but...there is no other time. school's up! this is the only time...what's wrong with now?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{well, you're drunk. like, really, really drunk.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{so? so are you.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{i'm not drunk at all. i don't even drink.}
<A>__{seth is absolutely shocked. it takes his remarkably drunk mind a moment to process this information.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{you don't drink? but...but, you told me to get the liquor!}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{yeah, i'm...uh...throwin' a party, remember?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{you don't drink!?!}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{no. i don't drink.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{and you, don't want to...uh, you know...}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{uh, no. not right now, thank you very much.}
<A>__{seth looks at jules and realizes that he's screwed up. his eyes start to water.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{ahhh....man...fuck....}
<A>__{seth starts to cry.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{are you crying?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{no! yeah, so what if i am? i'm a fucking idiot and it was my last chance! so i should be crying.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{last chance to do what?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{to make you my girlfriend for the summer, okay? there! you're, like, the coolest person that's ever talked to me, and i thought we'd both be drunk, but...}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{what would me be drunk have anything to do with it?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{`cause you'd never get with me in your right mind! look at me!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and now look at you!}
<A>__{suddenly, the front door opens, and a random girl walks out.}
<C>__{random girl}
<P>__{(yelling into the house)}
<D>__{hey, ricky! was it a quarter, or an eighth you want?}
<C>__{ricky }
<D>__{a fat eighth!}
<A>__{the random girl notices seth and jules.}
<C>__{random girl}
<D>__{whoa. sorry.}
<A>__{the girl hops down the stairs and walks off as jules stares at the sobbing seth.}
