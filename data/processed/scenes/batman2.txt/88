<L>__{exterior gotham park that moment night}
<A>__{the bus rumbles deeper into the snowy park. a black silhouette springs off the roof into the trees, disappearing among the branches... we track with the bus as it moves through the park, arriving finally at:}
<L>__{exterior clearing in park shantytown night}
<A>__{the little colony of homeless people in their cardboard shacks and lean tos, still occupying the future site of the park towers. marchers and picketers are continuing their protest nearby, and some charitable organization's set up a makeshift soup kitchen on folding tables hot coffee and sandwiches. vicki's on the periphery of the camp, camera in hand. she's trying to persuade a homeless man to let his picture be taken.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{please, just one. it's important for people to see what's happening.}
<C>__{homeless man}
<D>__{they don't want to see us, lady. they just want us gone out of sight, and out of mind.}
<P>__{(mumbling as he wanders off)}
<D>__{get worse before it gets better. it always does.}
<A>__{vicki turns. in the distance, the picketers are shrieking and wailing. a van's just pulled up to the edge of the park, and a dozen hardhats are elbowing their way through the crowd. all at once they're swarming through shantytown with tire irons and baseball bats, overturning the sandwich tables, ripping down the shabby tents and lean tos. some of the homeless people run. those who resist meet with swift and sudden violence. a marcher jumps a hardhat, and gets a baseball bat in the gut for his trouble. vicki waits for the police sirens, but they don't come. she backs off toward the trees, she begins snapping photos frantically, capturing the carnage on film. a hardhat is dismantling a lean to with his tire iron sending the terrified family inside scurrying off into the snow when he glances up and sees vicki taking his picture. he points her out to a colleague... ...and suddenly the two of them are rushing toward her with pure cold malice in their eyes. vicki turns to run, but it's slow going in the snow. she slips and falls; her attackers are almost upon her... ...when a shadowy figure dives out of the trees and tackles one of the hardhats. the figure lands a powerhouse blow to the fallen hardhats jaw, knocking him out cold. the second hardhat turns and lifts his tire iron. but the figure, with surprising agility, is already rolling out of the way. as he rolls, he grabs the first guy's hardhat off his head and brings it up in front of him blocking the blow from the second guy's tire iron. in the same motion, he plants a foot in the second hardhat's belly and sends him reeling backward, hardhat ii drops the tire iron, and the figure snatches it out of midair as he gets to his feet. he moves in on the second hardhat, brandishing the iron and while hardhat ii is staring at it, the figure high kicks him in the face. hop; kick. hop; kick. the figure has nailed him three times squarely on the jaw before he can hit the ground. the figure turns toward vicki. her eyes go wide with astonishment. it's a kid, thirteen or fourteen at the outside, sunken eyed, grimy looking, in a torn and tattered raincoat. she stares at him for the briefest of instants before he rushes off to the aid of his fellow homeless... she can't believe what she's seeing. the kid wades smack into the midst of the remaining hardhats, and kicks ass spinning, pirouetting, kicking, clawing in a furious display of pure athleticism. it seems like he's everywhere at once. there's only one other guy in gotham city who can handle himself like this... rallying behind him, the marchers and homeless people snatch bats and tire irons from the fallen hardhats and the tide turns. the invasion is being repelled. faced with renewed resistance, the few hardhats still left standing turn tail and race off to their van. triumph in shantytown. the marchers and homeless cluster together to lick their wounds and the kid, satisfied that everything is under control, turns and sprints off toward the trees. but one prostrate hardhat is only playing dead. as the kid runs past, the hardhat extends a tire iron into his path tripping him, sending him sprawling in the snow. the kid throws up his hands as the hardhat prepares to smash down at him... clang. the hardhat drops his tire iron and topples over, boardlike. the kid looks up and sees vicki standing there with a baseball bat. he gives her a quick nod of acknowledgement as he gets to his feet thanks for returning the favor. he's about to light out again when }
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{wait! don't be afraid. i wanted to thank you. i }
<C>__{kid}
<P>__{(cautiously)}
<D>__{twenty.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{twenty bucks.}
<A>__{vicki's mildly taken aback, but she reaches for her purse just the same. she's barely gotten her wallet open when the kid snatches the bill out of her hands. they stare at each other for a long moment }
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{...who are you?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{dick.}
<A>__{ and then he's bounding off like a shot. vaulting up into a tree and vanishing amid the snowy branches. vicki starts to follow, but there's no way she can keep up. instead she digs into her camera bag... her pov through telephoto lens using the long lens, she tracks the kid's progress through the treetops. she can't actually see him, but occasional chunks of snow and ice are falling to the ground as he jumps from limb to limb... for a moment it seems like she's lost him. as she sweeps the lens back and forth, scanning the trees, she catches sight of an equestrian statue in the distance. she ups the magnification so she can see the plaque on the pedestal. the stone figure on the horse is union war hero gen. oliver wayne bruce's great grandfather. as luck would have it, the kid drops to earth not ten feet from the statue vicki's got him in her sights again. he looks around cautiously to make sure no one's following, then races toward a stone bridge which arches between two small hillocks, over a frozen creek. there's a drainage tunnel, four or five feet in diameter, mounted in the bridge abutment, the kid pries off a wire grate and clambers inside, then pulls the grate back into place behind him. home sweet home.}
