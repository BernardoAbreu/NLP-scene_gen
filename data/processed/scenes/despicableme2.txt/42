<A>__{jerry slaps him. kevin slaps him back. they start to slap fight until a spotlight comes down from above, lighting up the terrified minions. before they can scream... woosh! jerry is sucked up into the air as if being abducted by aliens. kevin grabs onto a flower, and then the cat to try and anchor himself down, but they both fly up into the air. the light goes out. a few seconds later the light comes back on and drops the cat back down. it turns off again and the minions are gone.}
