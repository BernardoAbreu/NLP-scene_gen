<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{closeup molly drenched in blood. her eyes are glazed, on the verge of shock. panting, she stoops down to the curb as the camera travels with her. she grabs hold of something lying in the shadows and pulls it toward her. it is sam's dead body she is holding in her arms. sam's ghostly form, still solid to all appearances, stands beside molly. his eyes are awash in horror and confusion. he seems unable to move. the camera holds on his face as the full impact of his situation dawns in his eyes. suddenly he lets out a blood curdling scream.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no!!!!!!}
<A>__{he jumps down toward his body and reaches out to grab hold of his motionless form. his hands make a strange sound as they pass right though it. it is terrifying. sam jumps up, crazed, frenzied, and begins circling molly. it is as though he is trying to undo what has been done.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{this isn't happening. it's not happening.}
<A>__{he reaches out to molly for help. his hand cuts through her shoulder. he screams. footsteps. people are running down the street. the sound of sirens can be heard in the distance. two men run toward sam. he yells out at them.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{help me!}
<A>__{they run right through him. he gasps in stunned terror. sam watches helplessly as they reach his body. molly looks up and begins screaming hysterically. one of the men grabs her as the other goes for sam's wrist. there is no sign of life. the first man holds molly back as his friend stoops down and begins some form of cardio pulmonary resuscitation. there is no response. sam bends down, trying desperately to help. it is a futile gesture.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{do it! do it!}
<A>__{the man bangs on sam's chest. blood gushes from the wound. molly recoils. he bangs again.}
