<A>__{the sun hangs low in the sky. sam's cop car parks beside bret's monster truck.}
<L>__{interior palmer house day}
<A>__{ashley watches tv. a doctor resuscitates a dying patient with cpr. the doctor counts as he pumps the man's chest.}
<C>__{tv doctor }
<D>__{one... two... three...}
<A>__{ashley watches intently. the patient is revived.}
<C>__{tv doctor }
<D>__{helping people never gets old.}
<A>__{ashley hears keys in the front door. she quickly switches channels to mtv. sam enters with chris.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{is bret here?}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{then why is his truck out front?}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{don't worry about it.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what do you mean? what happened?}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{ashley starts crying. sam goes to comfort her daughter. chris stands by in shock. watching, upset.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{nothing happened, alright!}
<A>__{ashley runs off to her room. sam follows. chris stands alone for a beat. he walks to the kitchen and pulls a bottle of vodka from the freezer. he puts the cold bottle against his head and neck. trying to cool off. mike bursts into the house carrying his piece of exoskeleton. he sees chris opening the bottle of vodka.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{spiders shed their skins when they grow.}
<A>__{chris looks at mike for a moment.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{like snakes.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{gladys is dead.}
<A>__{chris drinks vodka straight from the bottle.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{maybe not.}
<A>__{that got chris's attention.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{this is a tarantula's leg. or it was. it's an exoskeleton, to be scientific.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{it's a little large.}
<A>__{chris has another gulp of vodka as mike holds up his cassiopeia full of spider data. he shows chris a video of a male tarantula mummifying its food. chris watches in amazement.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{see! male tarantulas wrap their prey in webbing. tight like a mummy. the food stays alive so they can eat it later.}
<A>__{sam enters the room in time to overhear this.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{mike, please. now isn't the time.}
<A>__{chris looks up at sam.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{they keep their food alive.}
<A>__{mike hands his mother the new piece of exoskeleton.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{a spider's leg!}
<A>__{sam flinches, dropping the object to the floor.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{careful!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no. that's a piece of cactus. look... it's covered with spines.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{those are quills! tarantulas can flick them at you like darts!}
<A>__{mike does an odd flicking motion. kind of like a dog scratching a flea.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{giant tarantulas?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{tarantulas! wolfs! trapdoors! joshua had a ton of exotics!}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{if there were giant spiders roaming the desert, don't you think somebody would've seen them by now?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{the jumpers hunt in daylight. but not the others. they only come out when the sun goes down!}
<A>__{the group looks to the window, the sun hangs low in the sky.}
