<A>__{the door to the shed is closed. alice looks around and then puts a hand on the hand. in cu we see the hand pull. the door doesn't budge. reaction shot: alice decides to pull harder. she puts down her lamp and uses both hands and tugs. she pulls until she finally wrenches the door open. the lamp casts long shadows upwards. the generator sits silent. alice leans into the shed to look. the camera tracks very slowly around behind her so that we can see behind the right hand corner of the building. as we clear the edge, we see something hanging from a rope which runs down from a branch above. the something turns slowly in the wind. it is bill dead in a travesty of the martyrdom of st. sebastian, shot with arrows. alice comes out of the shed, distraught.}

<A>__{she closes the door, and turns in the direction of the body. reaction shot: alice. she is riveted with horror, unable to move or turn or run. the soundtrack screams with the theme, the insistent stinger, a shriek and a thunderclap. alice finally gives voice to her terror again and again. she turns, leaving the lantern, and runs back towards the main cabin.}
