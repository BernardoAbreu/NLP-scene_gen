<L>__{interior living room night}
<A>__{an attractive woman, in her younger days a knockout, puts on a record and starts to pop her fingers to the music as she moves towards the center of the floor dancing by herself, inviting anyone bold enough to join her. a group of men who haven't seen each other in years are asking questions about news of old friends. okra is trying to get his camera working. herman is following m.c. through the crowd with his hand resting on m.c.'s shoulder as if he were a blind person. his racking cough is frightening. an older couple dancing attract the attention of the crowd. the man is wearing stacy adams shoes polished to see one's face in them. he gives expression to his moves as if he and the woman are talking with their bodies. junior and pat try to bring in something more modern to outdo the older couple. herman corners hattie, trying to get her to sing.}

<D>__{you folks excuse me but you know we have a celebrity from out of the past, our own nightingale. if you had any good times in your life, you remember hattie. she use to keep those juke joints steaming. if ma rainey and bessie smith were the stars, she was the sun. let's get hattie to sing something from the old days.}

<D>__{harry always tries to be the king fish. i told him i'm a new person. i'm saved.}
<A>__{harry signals an old man, percy, to start playing his guitar. percy starts to play but hattie doesn't join him. he looks to harry for a sign of what to do. hattie walks away. percy starts to sing by himself but someone puts a record on, interrupting his singing. people are back to dancing. a younger woman is dancing with an older man with such vigor, forcing the old man to try to keep up, that people grow concerned. people near him try to make him slow down but his pride forces him to be ridiculous.}
