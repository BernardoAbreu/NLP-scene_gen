<L>__{exterior laforche home day}
<A>__{sun spikes through the jostling leaves of a maple tree. a strong wind bends them back, showing their light green bellies. this is a modest house in a row of modest houses. propane tanks and farmland at their backs show this neighborhood to be more rural than suburb. curtis laforche(35) stands in his driveway. his eyes, locked on the sky, narrow as he stares at... a storm cell stretching out on the horizon in front of him. it's a bruised sky filled with a vicious mixture of black and gray clouds. they swirl in and out of one another sending wispy tentacles toward the ground. curtis stands, awestruck. the clouds move fast overhead. he looks up as they overtake his position. a light rain begins. the rain pats the ground. it makes soft indentions on his cotton shirt. he watches it hit the concrete, falling harder now. he notices something strange. the rain makes dark spots on the sidewalk. he pulls his shirt out and sees dark spots forming there. he holds his palm out flat in front of him. the rain pools. he rubs the water through his thumb and fingers. it's an amber color, viscous, like fresh motor oil. curtis looks to the sky, the rain pelting his face now. jagged, angry clouds blanketing overhead. the wind bends back the trunk of the maple tree. curtis stands alone at the base of the surging storm cell. title: take shelter}
<L>__{interior bathroom day}
<A>__{curtis holds his head under the running shower nozzle. cool, clean water rushes over his face.}
<L>__{interior kitchen day}
<A>__{samantha(29) stands at the stovetop stirring eggs in a pan. she's still dressed in her sleeping attire, an oversized t shirt and pajama bottoms with cartoon frogs on them. hannah(5) sits at the kitchen table tearing up a piece of toast and feeding it to the dog. hannah is a blonde little girl with a large hearing aid wrapped over her right ear. it clips into her hair near the back of her head. the dog's name is red, a rhodesian ridgeback that appreciates the attention. curtis enters the kitchen and kisses hannah on the head. in the same motion, he takes the piece of toast from her hand and sets it on her plate.}
<C>__{curtis}
<P>__{(takes a seat)}
<D>__{no, no, no...don't feed the dog darlin'.}
<A>__{hannah immediately picks the piece of toast back up and feeds it to the dog. samantha brings the pan over and spoons eggs out on everyone's plates.}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{thanks babe.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{you slept late.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{yeah. i need to go. what you got going today?}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{i've got to finish up some curtains for saturday, and nat and cam are coming over.}
<C>__{curtis}
<P>__{(mouth full)}
<D>__{with the kids?}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{yeah. cammie said she just needed to get out of the house.}
<A>__{samantha takes her seat at the table.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{tell nat to take it easy on her.}
<A>__{curtis gets up and goes to hannah.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{cam can hold her own. we need to send in the deposit for the beach condo.}
<A>__{he kneels beside his daughter's chair and waits for her to make eye contact. she looks over at him. he speaks using sign language. three broad, slow gestures.}
<C>__{curtis}
<P>__{(signing)}
<D>__{i love you.}
<A>__{hannah puts her arms around his neck and he squeezes her. he stands and grabs a sack lunch off the counter. on his way out, he kisses samantha on top of the head.}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{just write the check, babe. okay.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{okay. bye.}
<A>__{samantha sips her coffee as hannah feeds more toast to the dog.}
<C>__{samantha }
<P>__{(as she signs)}
<D>__{no more food. you, eat.}
<L>__{exterior laforche home day}
<A>__{curtis shoulders his way out the front screen door. keys in his mouth and sack lunch in his hand, he makes his way down the porch steps and onto the front walk. he pops open the chain link gate and heads for the pick up parked on the street. clear blue sky overhead.}
<L>__{exterior soybean field day}
<A>__{small soybean plants slouch in the noonday sun. a slight breeze picks up, jostling the leaves, but the sound is drowned out by a loud, mechanical rumbling. a spiral drill churns up dark soil as it digs deeper into the ground. curtis, wearing work goggles, grabs hold of the drill's cabling system and yanks down.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{yeah, let's keep going with that bit! it'll go another 10 feet!}
<A>__{he yells to dewart(36), a big guy sitting at the controls of a diesel powered well drilling rig. the truck has a long rusted bed with metal scaffolding raised high on its back.}
<C>__{dewart}
<D>__{we won't get the gravel pack down today!}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{why not?!}
<C>__{dewart}
<D>__{those clouds! we're gonna have to call it!}
<A>__{curtis looks back to a potential storm. gray clouds forming across the horizon.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{happy hour starts at five dewart!}
<C>__{dewart}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{not if it's rainin'...ready?}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{oh, yeah.}
<L>__{interior laforche home day}
<A>__{samantha sits at a table running a long piece of sheer fabric through her sewing machine. she's making curtains. nat(37) sips a screwdriver from a clear plastic cup designed not to sweat. she's a woman with rough edges. cammie(24) cradles a brown haired baby on top of her pregnant, eight month belly. as nat speaks, she looks out a sliding glass door at her two kids, dj(7) and sue(5), playing with hannah.}
<C>__{nat}
<D>__{they were just drinkin' and laughin' and oh, my god...it was like i was bein' in a museum and i saw the progress from apes to men. i saw it. i saw the future. dewart, that was him...that was going to be him in 20 years.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<A>__{cammie laughs.}
<C>__{nat}
<D>__{let me tell you, you laugh. you laugh. but this little one in your arms is gonna be shufflin' in a bar just like `em. yep...}
<P>__{(glances outside)}
<D>__{hannah!}
<A>__{samantha jumps up from her sewing to see outside. hannah, with her back to the house, bangs a 2 x 4 with a rusted nail in the end into the ground. samantha is out the door.}
<L>__{exterior backyard continuous}
<A>__{samantha walks briskly, talking to the other children.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{you guys okay?}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{samantha takes a wide line around hannah, who continues banging the two by four into the ground. as soon as the child sees her mother, she stops. samantha crouches in front of hannah, gently taking the board away from her. samantha signs with her hand and speaks at the same time.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{no. don't touch.}
<A>__{hannah tilts her head, looking off to the side. samantha touches her chin bringing her eyes back around.}
<C>__{samantha }
<P>__{(signing and speaking)}
<D>__{you understand?}
<A>__{hannah nods once, "yes".}
<C>__{samantha }
<D>__{oksy. come here.}
<A>__{samantha stands and takes the board to a trash pile in the back corner of the yard. a storm shelter is buried in the ground just behind the pile. it's a grass covered mound with two rusted metal doors angled toward the sky. she throws the board onto the heap and wipes her hands on her pants. staring at the pile, she lets out an irritated sigh. thunder rumbles low in the distance. she looks up at the approaching clouds and calls to the children as she walks back inside.}
<C>__{samantha }
<D>__{hey, dj. bring the girls inside.}
<L>__{exterior soybean field day}
<B>__{thunder strike.}
<A>__{the drill bit spins as rain pelts the ground turning the dark soil into black mud. curtis holds a rain slicker over his head. he watches as the hole they are drilling fills up with brown water. he lifts his boot, which makes a sucking sound as it dislodges from the mud. looking at the horizon, he sees no sign of the storm letting up. he looks to dewart, who smiles at him from behind the controls of the rig.}
<C>__{dewart}
<D>__{what? it's not my fault! i told you!}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{yeah. all right...all right! i'm callin' it! shut it down!}
<A>__{dewart gladly eases back on the lever at his knee. i e. laforche home late afternoon samantha holds the front door open as nat and cammie leave with their children packed up and in tow. it's raining pretty hard outside.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{bye guys. thanks for coming over.}
<C>__{nat}
<D>__{i will call next week about the lions club supper.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{okay. love you.}
<C>__{cammie}
<D>__{bye sam.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{bye cam.}
<A>__{running for her car holding a jacket covered car seat. samantha closes the door and listens to her quiet house. the rain outside is the only noise. she heads to the kitchen. in the kitchen, hannah is sitting indian style at the glass doors watching the rain. samantha walks over and kneels down behind her. she wraps her arms around hannah, who lifts a hand to the glass.}
<C>__{samantha }
<D>__{can you sign s t o r m?}
<A>__{samantha puts her hand onto the glass next to hannah's and signs "s t o r m". hannah turns to see her mother's face, and samantha uses both hands to make the signed symbol. fingers, spread and bent, moved downward.}
<C>__{samantha }
<D>__{storm.}
<A>__{hannah looks back out the window. they watch the storm together. i e. curtis' truck dewart's house night the blue top of a small cooler is knocked to the floorboard as dewart fishes the last busch tallboy out of icy water. he cracks it open and takes an extended sip. curtis, sitting behind the wheel of his truck, looks at his drunk friend.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{i gotta get home.}
<C>__{dewart}
<D>__{nat and me been lookin' into a threesome. we've been chattin' with a girl online from canton. yeah. big `ol girl.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{what's big?}
<C>__{dewart}
<D>__{she's about two fifty, two seventy five. she can't be no taller than 5 foot.}
<A>__{dewart starts laughing, which makes curtis laugh.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{shit man.}
<A>__{the laughing subsides.}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{i don't see me and sam gettin' into somethin' like that.}
<C>__{dewart}
<D>__{no. i don't guess you would.}
<A>__{dewart is staring at curtis.}
<C>__{dewart }
<D>__{you got a good life curtis.}
<A>__{curtis shrugs.}
<C>__{dewart }
<D>__{i'm serious. i think that's the best compliment you can give a man, take a look at his life and say, that's good. that guy's doin' somethin' right.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{well. it ain't always so easy.}
<C>__{dewart}
<D>__{hell i know that.}
<A>__{dewart sees something out his window.}
<C>__{dewart }
<D>__{ah shit. i gotta go...manana.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{good night.}
<A>__{nat, in a house robe and slippers, weaves her way through the maze of junk on their front lawn. dewart passes her without saying a word. curtis watches as she follows him inside the house, still talking. he shifts into drive and pulls away.}
<L>__{interior laforche home night}
<A>__{the lights are out and the house is quiet. curtis eases open the front door and steps inside. standing on the door mat, he slips off his mud caked boots and gently sets them aside. at hannah's bedroom door, curtis places his palm flat on the door and lets it open. hannah is curled up with the covers. he watches her sleep. samantha, barefoot and wearing a sleep shirt, walks up behind curtis. he turns his head when she approaches.}
<C>__{curtis}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{hey baby.}
<A>__{she wraps her arms around his waist and he lifts his elbow to make room for her. they whisper.}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{she do all right today?}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{she was fine. she's still not playin' with the others, though. she can't connect. honey, you gotta clean up that trash pile in the back. she fished out a board that had nails on it.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{i will get to it this weekend.}
<A>__{it's quiet for a moment.}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{i still take off my boots so i won't wake her up.}
<A>__{she smiles up at her husband.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{i still whisper.}
<A>__{he pulls her tight. they stand together in the doorway. the house is silent.}
<L>__{exterior laforche backyard day}
<A>__{curtis loads pieces from the trash pile into a wheelbarrow. he keeps an eye on hannah as she jumps on a small, plastic playscape in the middle of the backyard. the dog, red, paces by the back door. he's agitated, but his movement is limited by the length of rope tied from his collar to a nearby post. he barks.}
<B>__{thunder strikes.}
<A>__{curtis flinches at the loud boom. he looks to the sky and sees dark clouds twisting overhead. hannah plays, unaffected by the noise. to get a better view, curtis moves from beneath a tree in the corner of the yard and surveys the large swath of farmland that runs up to his property. chain link fencing partitions the yard from a deep concrete culvert that leads out to the open field. a giant storm cell gathers force on the horizon there. red barks incessantly. he winces and strains against the rope tied to his collar. curtis flinches again as a bolt of lightning streaks to the ground in the distance. sparks shoot into the air leaving a circle of scorched crops. another crack of thunder. a light rain begins. red snaps his head around and bucks into the air. he gnashes at the rope. curtis collects hannah off the playscape and turns back to the approaching storm cell. he holds up his hand and studies the falling rain. it's the thick, amber colored liquid. with hannah in his arms, curtis watches, awestruck, as wispy tentacles drip to the ground forming a collection of three tornados out in the field. behind them, red's teeth fray the rope at his collar. he thrashes his head, the rope snaps, and the dog flies toward curtis and hannah. curtis turns to see red charging them. he barely has time to set hannah down before red catches him by the forearm. they crash to the ground, tangled together. rain coming down hard now. curtis yells and waves hannah back. red, snapping, buries his teeth into the muscles in curtis' arm. blood streams from the wound. curtis screams in pain.}
<L>__{interior bedroom day}
<A>__{curtis bolts up in bed grabbing his forearm. he grinds his teeth and doubles over in pain. it takes a moment for him to find his bearings. his breathing slows. he gently rubs his hand over the skin on his arm. sweat has collected around his collar and temples. from the bed, sheets in a twisted mess, he looks around the room unsure of what just happened to him.}
<L>__{interior kitchen day}
<A>__{eggs cool on a plate. curtis sits at the kitchen table dressed for work. he stares vacantly at his breakfast. he looks up at hannah. she sits on the floor surrounded by toy building blocks and plays with the dog. she rubs under red's chest and in turn he licks her face. she smiles and gently pushes him away. samantha sits with her knees up drinking coffee.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{curtis?}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{did you hear me? you got to be home, showered, ready to walk out the door by six tonight.}
<A>__{curtis stands up and goes over to hannah. he grabs her off the floor and she begins to protest with kicks and crying.}
<C>__{samantha }
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{nothing. i just want her to eat her breakfast and stop playin' with the damn dog.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{she's fine down there. she had toast already.}
<A>__{curtis, against flailing, manages to get hannah in her chair. curtis backs off, frustrated. hannah climbs down from her chair and goes back to the floor and the dog.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{hannah. come here. hannah.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{curtis?}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{he stops and checks his watch.}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{i'm late.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{you didn't eat anything?}
<A>__{heading out.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{it's okay.}
<A>__{curtis is gone. samantha looks at hannah on the floor with the dog.}
<L>__{interior delta agri pro main office day}
<A>__{the main headquarters of delta agri pro is housed in a giant metal building. a row of cheaply built, 70's style offices with drop tile ceilings line the left of a large warehouse that contains all manner of agricultural and construction equipment. tractors, backhoes, welding rigs, etc. a group of men, many of which were represented at gator's bar yesterday, sit in folding chairs or stand in a semi circle around jim thompson(53). he speaks, clipboard in hand.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i didn't say you had control over the weather russell, what i did say was that the top shelf has to be cleared by the 15th. that's non negotiable.}
<A>__{dewart eats from a bag of sunflower seeds. curtis stares down at his forearm. he rubs the skin there. jim runs a finger down his clipboard.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{umm, curtis. where we at on that east 82nd site?}
<A>__{curtis snaps his head up, takes a second.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{yesterday slowed us down. we couldn't get the second pilot hole drilled.}
<A>__{jim drops his head and the clipboard falls to his side. a melodramatic move.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{it rained for two hours yesterday. two hours and our entire schedule went in the toilet. we lose the permit if you're not out of there by end of day.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{end of day curtis.}

<C>__{dewart}
<D>__{think we got time?}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{yeah. there's time.}
<L>__{interior home depot day}
<A>__{dewart stands by a flatbed cart with a prefab doghouse sitting on it. curtis loads chain link fencing materials onto the cart.}
<L>__{exterior soybean field day}
<A>__{the wheels of the well drilling rig are half sunk into the muddy soil. curtis stands over the hole being drilled. the turning metal pole suddenly seizes up and stops. smoke begins to seep up from the hole.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{sonofabitch.}
<A>__{dewart jumps down from the control panel to take a look.}
<C>__{dewart}
<D>__{we stripped that bit.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{yeah. well, bring it up. we gotta re set it.}
<A>__{dewart walks back to his controls. curtis heads to the cab of the drilling rig and checks his watch.}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{something catches his eye in the distance. clearing past the rig, he walks out into the adjacent field. he removes his goggles, eyes fixed on the acres of farmland that stretch for miles in front of him. in the sky overhead,}
<B>__{an enormous flock of birds roll in unison.}
<A>__{hundreds of them make up a black swarm that twists and shifts in the air. they dive bomb then ascend in intricate, geometric patterns. curtis watches, mesmerized. dewart strains a wrench against a bolt as the drill screeches in reverse.}
<C>__{dewart}
<D>__{curtis!}
<A>__{curtis acknowledges dewart but can't take his eyes off the pattern of birds. they shrink and stretch from thick clumps to long cylindrical tubes. a choreography. curtis reluctantly heads back to the rig, which is shrieking with the sound of metal on metal.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{you ever see birds fly like that?!}
<C>__{dewart}
<P>__{(holding his hand to his ear)}
<D>__{what?!}
<A>__{curtis looks back, giving the birds a final review. i e. curtis' truck house evening the sun has just set adding a purple hue to the sky. curtis steers his truck up to the front curb of his house. through his windshield, he sees samantha standing by her car, the back door open. she watches him pull up. hannah is already packed into her car seat.}
<C>__{curtis}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{parked, curtis climbs out and walks to the driveway.}

<D>__{come on we gotta go.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{ah, jesus. i could really use a shower.}
<A>__{samantha isn't having it. she climbs in the passenger seat. curtis makes his way to her car.}
<L>__{interior special education classroom night}
<A>__{curtis' work boots are encased in dry mud. chunks have broken off and pepper the thin blue industrial carpet. his mud stained fingers tap on the top of a desk. dirt caked under his nails.}
<C>__{teacher }
<D>__{so if you continue with the basic vocabulary, this will allow you to communicate with your children better.}
<A>__{curtis sits, filthy, at a school desk he doesn't quite fit into. a teacher speaks to a room full of parents.}
<C>__{teacher }
<D>__{between the ages of four and seven the focus is more on the sign and then later we'll begin adding the alphabet as more of a support syster. now in asl...}
<A>__{curtis looks over at samantha, who is sitting in the desk next to him. she won't look at him. he cranes his neck around to see toward the back of the room. an assistant teacher sits on a large, colorful rug with a group of children, all different ages, playing games that teach hand signs. hannah actively participates in the group.}
<C>__{teacher }
<D>__{...the male sign is signed at the forehead area. for example, father is signed up here like this...father, very good.}
<A>__{curtis turns back in his chair and makes the sign for "dad" along with the other parents.}
<L>__{interior special education classroom night later}
<A>__{curtis, samantha, and hannah sit on the floor in a circle atop the colored rug. samantha turns over large flashcards with illustrated scenes on them. they take turns making the corresponding sign. curtis stares at samantha, but she's still giving him the cold shoulder. finally, while holding up a card, she looks at him. he signs, "i'm sorry". a fist moving in a circular motion at his chest.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{you're not sorry.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{i am sorry.}

<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{i think i smell good.}

<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{do i smell good?}
<A>__{samantha laughs and tries to cover his mouth with her hand.}

<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{stop.}
<L>__{interior curtis' truck day}
<A>__{curtis slams the door to his truck, sealing him off from the torrential rainfall outside. he shakes water off, wipes his face. the windows are smeared by thick, dark rain. it's hard to see out. he looks over to hannah sitting in her car seat. it looks odd on the front bench of the truck. he signs to her.}
<C>__{curtis}
<P>__{(signing and speaking)}
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{she nods. he cranks the truck and turns on the wipers. the liquid on the windshield streaks into long smudges. curtis leans forward to get a better view of the street. he checks his blind spot and pulls away. moving fast on a main road, stop lights blur into hazy red and green spheres. curtis checks the rearview, but the back window is covered by the rain. he tries rolling down his window, but water blows in. he rolls it back up and the smudging gets worse. the truck shimmies from left to right, pushed by the wind. a thunder strike rattles. suddenly,}
<B>__{the shape of a person standing in the road.}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{curtis stomps on the brakes and turns the wheel. the truck hydroplanes. crash! curtis' head busts against the steering column. the front windshield cracks as the truck jerks to a stop. the hiss of a broken radiator. curtis winces from the blow to his head. hannah is crying. he reaches over to her.}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{are you okay?}
<A>__{hannah physically looks all right, but she continues crying. curtis reaches out and places a hand on her head. he's dazed, mumbling.}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{you're okay.}
<A>__{the truck is angled up slightly like the front end has inched up a pole. a cut on his forehead has begun to bleed. he sees movement. a person passes by the hazy side window. a shape moves past the driver's window. the truck shifts as weight is added to the bed. the sound of someone pulling things from the back of the truck. a moment. whack! curtis flinches as a 2x4 pounds the windshield. the truck jostles from the weight of someone jumping on the hood. bump. bump. the roof caves in with two footsteps. curtis looks around frantically. he reaches over to hannah and begins to unstrap her from the car seat. smash! a board breaks through the passenger window. a woman, pale and aggressive, stands in the rain storm staring through the broken glass. she reaches for the lock. curtis pulls hannah from the child seat and recoils against his door but is jolted as another board crashes through the driver's window. a hand yanks curtis by his collar. he's pulled against the door. a pasty forearm wraps around his neck, choking him. he strains against the arm. sucks air. needing to breath. the woman at the passenger door grabs for hannah. curtis kicks at her. a man's boot kicks out the back window. the man in the bed of the truck reaches for curtis' face. he flails and kicks, unable to break free from the forearm at his door. the woman gets hold of hannah. the child is yanked from curtis' arms. he screams.}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{hannah! hannah!}
<A>__{hands claw at curtis' face. scratching. blood streaks. the woman has disappeared into the storm with hannah. curtis screams. fingers swoop into his open mouth, grabbing hold of his cheek. they pull the cheek back. tearing. he yells in pain.}

<D>__{good, you're up.}
<A>__{curtis doesn't turn to greet her. he just stirs a spoon in the black coffee. samantha walks up to him and puts a hand on his back. she notices that his shirt is soaked with sweat.}
