<A>__{drawers are slamming open and shut as cameron hurriedly stuffs his few belongings into his pockets.}
<B>__{wider angle}
<A>__{it's a mean little bedroom, with sam's clothes, typewriter, etc., in evidence. seeing sam's wallet, cameron pulls a wad of money from it, at the same time accidentally knocking sam's false teeth off the dresser. he hesitates, then stuffs back all the bills but a twenty. he strides to sam's closet, pulls out shirt and slacks, stuffs them in a cloth beach bag, also belonging to sam and starts out the door. then he stops, gets on his hands and knees, looking for the false teeth, which he finally finds. now, annoyed at himself for being a "nice guy," he throws them carelessly on the dresser and quickly exits.}
