<A>__{the wonder bras sway in, take seats at the vip table.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i will swing by your house around 7.}
<A>__{mike rises.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i wouldn't go over there. stan and his baboons have lunch this period.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{don't worry. i will see you tonight.}
<A>__{mike strolls over to the bras' table, plunks himself down.}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{did you girls catch ellen yesterday? rosie was on. melissa etheridge jammed }
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{ you're so rude!? we're not gay. we like boys.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{yeah, samantha's a total slu...}
<A>__{samantha's jaw drops.}
<C>__{lauren}
<D>__{last new year's samantha made it with my boyfriend.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{i was on like 5 red bulls! i can't believe you keep bringing that up.}
<A>__{the bras' begin to bicker amongst themselves. mike pulls out his new iphone, plugs the earphones in his ears. the bras immediately stop bickering, ogle the phone.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{rad phone.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i know. i will text you... not. later... much.}
<A>__{mike rises from the table.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{like we'd ever give you our numbers.}
<A>__{stan, carrying a basketball, his goons and maggie come up behind mike.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{heads up!}
<A>__{stan whips the ball at mike. mike, cat quick, spins around, catches the ball. the whole cafeteria turns their attention on mike and stan. mike points to the name `stan' on stan's letter jacket, reads }
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{stan. did mommy sew that on there so you wouldn't forget your name?}
<A>__{laughter from the students.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{you think `cause you got a haircut and new clothes people'd forget what a fag you are?}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{cut it out, stan. let's eat.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{gimme my ball back, bee yotch.}
<A>__{mike ignores him and starts dribbling.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{you know, stan, i feel sorry for you.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{you don't know me.}
<A>__{mike speaks loudly now, playing to the cafeteria.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{oh but i do. all too well. you're the man. captain of the basketball team. dates the pretty girls. high school is your kingdom.}
<A>__{stan and his posse tap fists. mike dribbles between his legs.}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{but, people, stan's a bully. why? it would be way too easy to say stan preys on the weak because he's simply a dick. no, stan's more complex than that. according to leading psychiatrists stan is a bully for 1 of 3 reasons. 1, under all that male bravado there's an insecure little girl banging on the closet door trying to get out. 2, like a caveman, stan's brain is underdeveloped. therefore stan is unable to use self control so he acts out aggressively. and the third reason }
<A>__{mike holds up his pinky then spins the ball on it.}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{i'd argue that stan suffers from all 3.}
<A>__{the entire cafeteria laughs hysterically. mike feigns whipping it back at stan, who recoils, then gently rolls the ball back to stan.}
<C>__{mike }
<P>__{(winks)}
<D>__{don't hurt yourself big boy.}
<A>__{some students, including alex, erupt. the wonder bras eye mike with new found lust. angle on mike's face as he walks away.}
<C>__{mike }
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{3, 2, 1...}
<A>__{mike ducks just as the ball whizzes overhead, rockets across the cafeteria landing on miss goodwin's tray, splattering her with food. she glares at stan. mike's iphone buzzes... angle on screen: the wonder bras digits appear.}
