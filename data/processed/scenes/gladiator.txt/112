<L>__{exterior colosseum day}
<A>__{the hymn is all we hear as we see... the stands are filling. we see the rich and poor alike. we see the orator cassius. we see senator falco and most of the senate. we see the cohort of fifty praetorian taking up position around the imperial box. a golden platform, with stairs down to the arena sand, now extends about twenty feet from the imperial box to a spot over the arena. we float down the stairs and then we see the arena itself... it is stunning in its simplicity. the days victims are tied to posts in the center of the arena. suspended above them is an enormous cloud. a thick, tumescent bladder painted to look like a threatening rain cloud. we see proximo and juba. we see senators gracchus and gaius. we see gaius' wife and gracchus catamite and christian families and scholars and actors. seven stylized hills surround them. the hymn comes to its soaring conclusion as we see the damned.}
