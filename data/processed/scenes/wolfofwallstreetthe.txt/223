<D>__{there's a term we have around here, we don't like to use it often, only when circumstances dictate. it's called a "grenada." inspired by our government's invasion in 1983 of the island nation of only 90,000 people, basically it stands for any case we get which is pretty much unlose able. we could show up late and drunk to court, fuck up left right and center and still we'd win. mr. belfort, you, sir, are a "grenada."}
