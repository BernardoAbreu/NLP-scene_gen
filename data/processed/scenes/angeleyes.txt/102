<L>__{interior catch's bedroom night}
<A>__{he is sitting on his bed, back against the headboard, sitting there fully dressed, shoes and all, knees up as he plays his muted trumpet, hard and fast, playing the incredible riffs we've been hearing, playing in a driven way, keeping his demons away. when the ring of the phone breaks through, he stops suddenly. he waits. his machine clicks on and beeps. we intercut : the call as sharon's voice comes on, subdued.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{catch, it's me. can you pick up?}
<A>__{but he sits there, waiting, listening.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{why don't we... meet tomorrow? i will be in westwood. can you meet me there? westwood and cole. about two o'clock. okay?}
<A>__{he sits there. he slowly puts the horn down. he reaches for the phone now but she hangs up before he picks up the call.}
