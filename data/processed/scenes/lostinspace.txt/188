<D>__{star light, star bright...}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{a million strange stars and only one wish. i wish we were home.}
<A>__{don comes and sits in the co pilot's chair beside her.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{i never thought a sky could look so alien. ...we really are lost.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{when the first sailors circled the globe and saw a brand new sky, they thought they had sailed off the edge of the earth. but they were really just around the corner.}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{we just billow our sails and let the wind blow us home, is that it major?}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{so those sailors found familiar shapes in the stars to make the skies more friendly, to help them find their way.}
<A>__{don turns on a monitor below the viewscreen. monitor close. it shows the star field above. he lifts a light tipped stylus.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{that's how constellations were born.}
<A>__{don begins to draw on the screen, connecting the stars like dots in a children's book. slowly, a familiar porcine face takes form.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{porky the wise and mighty pig.}
<A>__{judy laughs. she takes the stylus. begins to draw.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{the great bucktoothed bunny... bugs.}
<A>__{don smiles. judy can't help but smile back. their faces are close.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{so, my quarters or yours?}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{we are the only single man and woman of consenting age in the galaxy. how much more of a set up do you need?}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{so you figure just dispense with the pleasantries, get down to business?}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{you have a way with words, doctor.}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(provocative)}
<D>__{right here? on this console?}
<A>__{don moves his face to hers, only a breath apart.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{here would be fine.}
<A>__{judy smiles sweetly. don close. lips parting. suddenly water begins to pour down over his head. his eyes open wide. judy holds her empty glass in hand.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{next time, fly slower.}
<A>__{she rises, walks off, leaving don mopping his brow.}
