<A>__{skirting a roadblock, archer appears to be coming undone... wobbly, wild eyed... he suddenly picks up a trash can and carries it down the street in front of his face. pedestrians gawk at this madman. what's he doing? archer finally stops in front of a sporting goods store. he swings the trash can. smash! the store's window shatters. an alarm blares. passersby stare at archer for a moment stunned. then several youths leap into the window and start pulling merchandise out of the store. mayhem as others join in... clerks rush out to do battle. an lapd squad car hauls up onto the curb. a cop leaps out and chases as the looters scatter. the driver stands at his door, radio in hand. sensing something, he turns... just as archer grabs the canister of comply gas from the cop's belt. archer sprays him in the face. the cop gags and sags. archer quickly slips behind the wheel. inside: archer hits a switch the car's tinted windows darken automatically, obscuring him from the outside. he hits the gas screaming away.}
