<L>__{interior bryan burke's office morning}
<A>__{george steps in and the secretary closes the door to the office. bryan approaches with his arm outstretched, but george can only raise the paper towels.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{a bird caught me.}
<A>__{bryan grabs a trashcan and holds it up; george tosses the ball into the trash and sits down.}
<C>__{bryan}
<D>__{orange juice...croissant?}
<A>__{bryan motions with his hand as he sits.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i'm good, thanks.}
<C>__{bryan}
<D>__{what are you on?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{pardon me?}
<C>__{bryan}
<D>__{how much weight have you lost?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{oh...nothing. thirty pounds. i just haven't been very hungry.}
<C>__{bryan}
<D>__{how's your wife?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{when we divorce a decade ago, she was very, very angry.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now she's just hostile.}
<A>__{bryan nods and laughs as he takes a chunk of croissant and chews as he talks.}
<C>__{bryan}
<D>__{right...she married...what was he?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{he buys and sells the world.}
<C>__{bryan}
<D>__{peter webber! right. quite the spotlight on that guy.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i did tell you, didn't i? that i'd be ready to start the berlin model today?}
<C>__{bryan}
<D>__{well, that's sort of...you're sure you're not hungry?}
<A>__{bryan is anxious as he holds up the rest of the croissant. george shakes his head "no". bryan tosses his croissant into the trash can and leans forward.}
<C>__{bryan }
<D>__{this isn't me.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we can show clients endless options, change anything in a matter of hours on the computer. but you won't change.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why i started building models.}
<C>__{bryan}
<D>__{all of us are typing and clicking, george. whether we want to, or not.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i'm not.}
<C>__{bryan}
<D>__{which is why we bid out a quarter of our projects. it doesn't make a lot of sense anymore to want what we don't have and don't want what we do.}
<A>__{george glances around the office, angered by the thought he's being fired.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i've been here twenty years.}
<C>__{bryan}
<D>__{maybe that's too long.}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(hopeful)}
<D>__{maybe...?}
<C>__{bryan}
<D>__{that's too long.}
<A>__{george nods as he stares at bryan.}
<C>__{bryan }
<D>__{listen, they decided on a week a year severance, but i got them to twenty six. that's six months salary, george. medical and everything for six months. you can learn all you need to on the computer long before that. maybe find a job closer to home.}
<A>__{bryan is rattled by george's blank stare. he takes his glass of orange juice and sits back in his chair, taking a sip, all the while keeping an eye on george.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{my wife left me because i wasn't...very emotional. i kept trying to explain that my father sucked all the emotion from me. drunks do that, sometimes. make their kids afraid. make them unwilling to express themselves.}
<A>__{bryan knows he's supposed to say something, he just can't seem to figure out what.}
<C>__{bryan}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{how old are you?}
<C>__{bryan}
<D>__{forty.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{we were probably in school together. you went to berkley?}
<A>__{bryan lights up at the sound of his alma matter.}
<C>__{bryan}
<D>__{class of eighty six! i didn't know you were there.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i was a sophomore when i got the call my parents were dead.}
<A>__{this is not the direction bryan had hoped the conversation was headed.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{my dad had a blood alcohol level of .18. a little high. drove right into oncoming traffic. killed my mother with him. a lady in another car. hurt her daughter. a five year old girl. i think about her still.}
<A>__{bryan wants this to end. he leans forward with a whisper.}
<C>__{bryan}
<D>__{listen...maybe i can get you a year.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i hate this job.}
<C>__{bryan}
<D>__{what are you talking about? you love your job.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{from the day i started...to today. can't stand it.}
<A>__{bryan is perplexed as george stands.}
<C>__{bryan}
<D>__{then it sounds like i'm doing you a favor.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{it may sound that way, but i react out of fear. my life has nothing to do with what i like or don't like. you haven't been listening, have you?}
<C>__{bryan}
<D>__{i didn't know there would be a quiz, george.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{for everything.}
<C>__{bryan}
<D>__{well, i feel better about this now.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{good. i was hoping for that.}
<A>__{relieved and not understanding anything about irony, bryan stands and extends his hand. george shakes bryan's hand without malice.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{i've got one favor to ask.}
<C>__{bryan}
<D>__{what can i do for you, george?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i built my first model here when i was twenty. there are hundreds of them on shelves around the office. twenty years of my life. i was wondering if i might be able to pick a few to keep, to take home? only the ones that really mean something to me.}
<A>__{bryan recoils slightly from the request.}
<C>__{bryan}
<D>__{oh, well...those are...i mean, we don't get to keep our work. i could maybe ask them if you could choose one. but, you know, frankly george, you were the best. computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours. they're a part of this firm. they inspire me. i go out there and sometimes just stare at something i've designed. it amazes me. i would miss that too much.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{look, i may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you. just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but i'm sure it'll be okay.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{bryan}
<D>__{well, it's the least i can do.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{yes, it is.}
<A>__{george nods and leaves. bryan looks lost and guilty again.}
