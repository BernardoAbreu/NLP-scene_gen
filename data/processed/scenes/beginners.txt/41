<L>__{interior hal's hospital room night}
<A>__{in the dark i.c.u. room, hal is still attached to many i.v.s, oliver is helping hal look at a book of japanese rock gardens with a flashlight.}
<C>__{oliver}

<D>__{oh, that's nice.}
<A>__{hal keeps peeking at a bouquet of flowers in the corner of the room. hal takes the flashlight from oliver and guides it to the flowers.}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{oh, andy brought those for you.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{oh, yeah?}
<A>__{hal continues to direct the light across the room, we follow the circle of light as it moves a cross a wall landing on a painting.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{oh, who did that painting?}
<C>__{oliver}

<D>__{a , and these?}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{they're just photos, pop.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{but how do they relate to the exhibit?}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{they're just personal photos. they're not art.}
<A>__{hal slowly moves the flashlight up the wall, across the ceiling to a strange assortment of fire detectors, sprinklers, sensors, all laid out against the acoustic tile ceiling. hal points up. oliver looks for a beat, then...}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{uh, well that's the water sprinkler thing.}

<D>__{putting the japanese gardens there. it's just beautiful.}
<A>__{oliver looks from the ceiling to the rock garden book. the ceiling and the gardens look the same. oliver is moved by hal's confusion. andy, 45 years old, physical, boyish, storms into the room.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{hal.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{andy!}
<A>__{andy gets on the bed opposite oliver. he gives hal a big kiss on the lips. hal glows. oliver backs away slowly. andy picks up hal's hand, turns it palm up and presses his face into it.}

<A>__{oliver watches from outside the room as andy excitedly pulls a portable tape player out of his bag.}
<C>__{andy}

<C>__{andy on tape}
<D>__{this is for our friend hal fields. hal. we love you.}
<A>__{we hear voices hooting, and then large fireworks, laughter and clapping. oliver watches his father's happiness from a distance.}
