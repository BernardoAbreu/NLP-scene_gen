<A>__{there's an enormous circular bathtub and a jacuzzi, endless mirrors, a writing desk, carpeted, a place one could spend one's life in mike seen, in the mirrors, wandering through idly pushing a mirrored door open, to gaze, in awe, at the walk in closet.}

<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{fuckin' a.}
<A>__{angle: he see t.j., or what he thinks is t.j., reflected among the other reflections at the other end of the room. sees t.j. sit on edge of bed. mike is standing in center of the mirrors, slightly disoriented. and t.j. sees him, similarly astounded, moving out of shot. close on mike: moving inward, he gawks at the racks of clothes, gently brushing his hand through the lush fabrics. claire's voice angry, almost trembling, a firm effort of will rustles the silence behind him.}
