<L>__{exterior grounds. yasnaya polyana. day.}
<A>__{and into the drive to greet chertkov. he moves immediately to her, offers her his hand and an unctuous smile.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{vladimir grigorevich, what a surprise.}
<C>__{chertkov}
<D>__{sofya andreyevna, i'm happy to see you.}
<A>__{valentin watches her match him smile for smile.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{and i'm happy to make you happy...always.}
<L>__{exterior road to telyatinki. day}
<A>__{valentin and chertkov sit together in the droshky, an awkward silence.}
<C>__{chertkov}
<D>__{i'm glad to have a moment alone with you, valentin. how do you think you're getting on?}
<C>__{valentin}
<P>__{(a little nervous)}
<D>__{i hope my work is pleasing to leo nikolayevich.}
<C>__{chertkov}
<D>__{yes. he seems satisfied and that's good. the reports i've received from you however... there seems to be some confusion.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{chertkov}
<D>__{you send me never ending commentary on tolstoy's writing. that's all very interesting but not very useful. i need to know what goes on with sofya andreyevna. you must see by now she's committed to undermining her husband's best intentions.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{it's not quite so obvious to me.}
<C>__{chertkov}
<D>__{because she is duplicitous. you are very bright. too bright to let her into you.}
<A>__{chertkov fixes the boy with his intense gaze.}
<C>__{chertkov}
<D>__{you value our work?}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{chertkov}
<D>__{the ideals we share?}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{that's why i'm here.}
<C>__{chertkov}
<D>__{good, of course it is. (beat) do you think the countess suspects something?}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{well, i think the countess is very suspicios by nature.}
<C>__{chertkov}
<D>__{how so?}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{i don t think she likes you very much.}
<C>__{chertkov}
<D>__{what does she say?}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{it s a tone i ve picked up.}
<C>__{chertkov}
<D>__{we simply want to distribute tolstoy's work to the widest audience possible. she just has no understanding what it is we are trying to do. there s nothing in it for any of us but a real chance to increase the world s happiness.}
<A>__{he takes valentin's hand.}
<C>__{chertkov}
<D>__{i can only be of limited help to the master if i don't know what's going on. any effort she makes to shore up control of the copyright, i must know. the survival of our movement depends on it. remember who your friends are. what you've come here to do.}
<A>__{chertkov turns away to watch the countryside. valentin stares straight ahead, his nose twitches slightly.}
