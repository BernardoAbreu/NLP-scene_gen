<L>__{exterior fifteen years ago night (flashback)}
<A>__{the parker house many years ago. the house semi furnished. ellen carefully hangs her first bird photographs on the wall; a striking aerial photo of a golden eagle. wings spread, soaring high over a mountain range.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{i thought we both wanted the same things.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{i've changed my mind.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{you can't change your mind.}
<A>__{beat. ellen takes a seat on the only sofa.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{i want children.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{you've just decided, is that right?}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{young maurice is visibly upset.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world }
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{please not, 'the two kinds of people' speech.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{... people that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... my parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway. i don't want us to be that way ellen.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{you can change.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{face it ellen, i'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. but you love me anyway.}
<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(upset)}
<D>__{don't be so sure.}
<A>__{ellen fiddles with her dress. she bites her bottom lip as she tries not to cry.}
<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(shaky voice)}
<D>__{what if something happens to one of us? we'll be all alone.}
<A>__{maurice loses his hard demeanor and moves next to her. he lays his hand across her shoulder.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{nothing will happen to us. it's a bleak picture, i know, but we're going to be together till were old and grey and you don't remember my name anymore.}
<A>__{maurice lifts her chin with his hand gently. she blinks her eyes and a tear rolls down her cheek. he takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{let me think about it okay.}
<A>__{ellen brightens up immediately.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{i'm not saying anytime soon. i'm just saying that maybe we can consider it down the road sometime.}
<A>__{ellen gives her patented glowing smile. she hugs him with all her strength. she whispers in his ear.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{i love you maurice parker.}
