<L>__{interior nelson dining room day}
<A>__{a world class chef and his sous chef serve the nelson's a filet mignon dinner. mom, dad, jimmy, ted, and julie, sit at the table. set with the finest china. the most elegant linens. a fresh floral arrangement. the best of everything. everyone waits for mom as she takes her first bite.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{goodness...it's delicious. i've never tasted anything so tender.}
<A>__{the rest of them dig in.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{beats the heck out of meatloaf.}
<P>__{(off mom's look)}
<D>__{although your meatloaf is second to none, love muffin.}
<A>__{jimmy's eyes widen as he chews.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{mom, dad. my trembling taste buds have just been assailed by the bittersweet knowledge of all they've been missing these past nine years.}
<A>__{the chef turns to julie...}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{no offense, wolfgang puck, but dead flesh is dead flesh. this just happens to be better than most dead flesh on the planet.}
<A>__{and finally, the chef waits for ted...}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{absolutely...heavenly.}
<A>__{the chef wipes a bead of sweat from his brow. approval, at last, from the only opinion that mattered.}
<C>__{chef}
<D>__{why, thank you, sir. thank you.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{ted has bettered our lives to the point where i can no longer see myself as "the old jimmy" i was but a day or two past. you may all call me james. from this moment forward.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{finally, some gratitude.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{we're grateful, ted. it's not that. those craftsman tools...they're a dream come true.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{your dad and i were raised with a certain work ethic, that's all.}
<A>__{julie listens closely, admiring ted's parents.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{we can't start living like we're the rockerfellers or something.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{mom, dad. the rockerfellers are paupers compared to my favorite brother, ted.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you don't have to work another day in your lives.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{but how would we pay our bills?}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{we just barely have enough for your college tuition, son.}
<A>__{ted's frustration mounts.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{don't you get it? in one day i earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{oh. goodness.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you're free. you can do anything you ever wanted to do!}
<C>__{mom}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{like take that trip to buckingham palace. go deep sea fishing in the gulf of mexico. now's your chance.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{but those are our dreams, son. we have to make them come true.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part. no more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{but who would run the store?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{forget the store. think big.}
<A>__{dad looks at mom. forget the store. that stings.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{ted, we put a lot of love in our business.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{we wanted you and jimmy to have it someday. something real and honest.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{we love our lives just the way they are.}
<A>__{disappointed, disgusted, ted looks to julie for support. tears fill her eyes. mom and dad moved her. ted shrugs and digs into his food.}
