<A>__{mr. pink is hauling ass down a busy city sidewalk. he has a canvas bag with a shoulder strap in one hand, and a .357 magnum in the other. if any bystanders get in his way, he just knocks them down. we dolly at the same speed, right along side of him. four policemen are running after mr. pink. we dolly with them. we dolly with a young woman on roller skates. rollergirl is plugged into a walkman. we hear the song she's listening to loud over the soundtrack. she's twirling and skating backwards to the beat of the song. rollergirl turns a corner and collides with mr. pink. the man and woman crash to the ground. mr. pink rolls into the street, in front of a moving car that screeches to a stop, narrowly avoiding running over him.}
