<A>__{both dwight and toby sweating heavily. they lean against a wall, resting.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{you said you'd show me how to dry gulch somebody.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{okay. now you can always kick somebody in the balls, but i like this one better: what you do is hit 'em in the throat with the side of your forearm. you wait 'til hah!}
<A>__{without warning, dwight lunges at toby and swings the side of his arm toward toby's throat. toby dodges wildly, falling backward over a box of sports equipment.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{now that's dry gulching. hit 'em in the throat, but do it before they're expecting it. now you try.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i'm afraid i will hurt you.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{you won't.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{but i might.}
<A>__{finally toby gives a half hearted "hah!" and swings the side of his forearm toward dwight's throat. dwight catches the arm easily.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{come onnn. you're not trying.}
<A>__{again toby hesitates, again he says "hah!" and gives a lukewarm swing at dwight's throat.}

<A>__{toby's eyes flare up, then he lowers his head, biting his lip, sniffling a bit.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{aw, jesus christ, if you're gonna }
<A>__{without warning, toby lunges at dwight, screaming "hah!" trying for the man's throat. caught off guard, dwight stops the main force of toby's arm, but is slammed onto the ground stunned.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{you just about got dry gulched, my man.}
<A>__{dwight manages a grin, but he is not happy to have been bested.}
