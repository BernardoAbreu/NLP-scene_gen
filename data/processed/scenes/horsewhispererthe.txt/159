<L>__{interior kitchen night}
<A>__{as diane and annie prepare coffee and dessert;}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{i was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the pyramids. were you ever in egypt?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i was there for that shot, actually.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{what was it like?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{oh, god i think it was the fourth or fifth time i'd been there, so all i remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was...}
<A>__{she laughs as she directs this last line to diane, who just smiles. and annie realizes that's not what she meant at all. this woman is starving for glimpses into this other life.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{but, uh, egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. it's like going back in time.}
<P>__{(diane listens)}
<D>__{i remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and i felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. ha, i never realized how hard it was to describe.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{i'd love to go there one time...}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{you and frank ever take a vacation?}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{soon. we're going to branson, missouri to see my cousin emma married. frank loves in there.}
<A>__{annie can sense the disappointment in her voice, and at the same time, the comfortable resignation. suddenly, from inside, they hear loud overlapping voices as the children fight.}
<C>__{twin }
<D>__{it was my turn!}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{ya just had a turn. it was not.}
<C>__{twin }
<D>__{was so!}
