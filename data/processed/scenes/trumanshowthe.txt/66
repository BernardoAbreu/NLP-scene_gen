<D>__{you don't tell me, i will get you investigated!}
<C>__{security guard 2}
<D>__{investigate what? you're trespassing!}
<A>__{truman sees there is no point in arguing further. his shouts are attracting the interest of passers by. a thought occurs to him. he starts to run along the street, suddenly entering another building at random. an office block with a bank on the ground floor. as he skirts the bank, he feels the eyes of the bank staff and customers on him. is he so suspicious looking or were they expecting him? truman rushes to the elevators. the lights above the doors show all the elevators on upper floors. frantic pressing of the elevator button gets no response. truman heads for the stairs but is intercepted by a bank official who bars his way.}
<C>__{official}
<D>__{you can't }
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(anticipating his response)}
<D>__{ i know.}
<A>__{truman backs away out of the office and continues to run down the streets of lower manhattan's financial district. every building he encounters seems to have a security guard anticipating his arrival or a building official hanging a closed for business sign on the front door. he feels the eyes of pedestrians. is he simply drawing attention to himself by his behavior? truman wheels around, trying to make eye contact with passers by. they shy away. truman stops still, his head reeling.}
