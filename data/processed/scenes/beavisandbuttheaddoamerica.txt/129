<T>__{back on beavis:}
<C>__{beavis}
<D>__{yeah, heh heh i scored.}
<A>__{animated bubbles appear around beavis' head.}
<C>__{beavis }
<D>__{hey butt head, i'm starting to feel weird. i think i'm freaking out. butt head huh? huh huh.}
<C>__{beavis}
<D>__{whoa, this is cool! heh heh. it's like, everything looks all weird and...}
<A>__{beavis' p.o.v. of butt head: his face starts to warp and colors start shifting.}
<C>__{beavis }
<D>__{...and... whoa!...and it's like there's all these weird shapes and it's sort of like,...it's like...like a music video!!!}
<A>__{tight on beavis' face staring in wonder. this is where the music video hallucination sequence begins. it could even be so shameless as to actually have a chyron in the lower left hand corner. i would like to have a band (white zombie?) do a version of something like, "fire," by the crazy world of arthur brown. this is the song that begins, "i am god of hellfire and i bring you... fire!" the concept of this will depend somewhat on which band we get, but i would like to see it get pretty wild and surreal. (if it's white zombie, we could incorporate some of rob zombie's artwork.) beavis' p.o.v.: we see the sun above the horizon turn into a giant ball of fire. the ball of fire develops a face and speaks.}
<C>__{fire}
<D>__{i am god of hellfire and i bring you...(music begins) fire...}
<C>__{beavis}
<D>__{whoa!!! this kicks ass!!!}
<A>__{this is the greatest video beavis has ever seen. out of the ball of fire steps a beautiful woman in a bikini. at first the video is mostly the god of hellfire, chicks in bikinis and various images of b&b's tv in all its glory. as the video hallucination continues, it becomes a psychotic mass of naked people, fire, tvs, vultures, b&b head banging, weird stuff from my high school notebooks, etc. at one point we see the god of hellfire in a burger world uniform. as the song winds down, we incorporate muddy's car into the surreal imagery. (we should also incorporate their tv, as well as maybe some of the characters from the show that aren't in the movie.) then, we reveal muddy's car actually pulling up to b&b's near dead bodies. the song ends as muddy tosses water on b&b. reveal they were not far from the side of a road all along.}
<D>__{b&b ahhhhghhhhgh!}
<A>__{b&b snap out of it. they rise and find muddy hovering over them with a shotgun.}
<C>__{beavis}
<D>__{aagh! i'm all wet!...(realizing) oh, cool. heh heh heh. water.}
<A>__{muddy aims his shotgun at b&b.}
<C>__{muddy}
<D>__{ah'm gonna enjoy this. any last words b'fore ah kill ya?}
<A>__{b&b think.}
<D>__{butt head uh... huh huh. i have a couple. butt cheeks, huh huh huh.}
<C>__{beavis}
<D>__{yeah! boobs. heh heh. i just wanna say that again. boobs. heh heh.}
<C>__{muddy}
<D>__{ah'm gonna blow you both to hell! butt head cool, huh huh. (realizing) hey beavis that's that dude that's paying us to do his wife.}
<C>__{beavis}
<D>__{oh yeah. can you just take us to washington? we're gonna meet her there and, you know, heh heh hmmm...}
<C>__{muddy}
<D>__{washington! that's where she was gonna meet up with ya? (realizes) damn, she's goin' all the way! b&b huh huh huh huh huh huh huh.}
<A>__{muddy lowers the gun a bit.}
<C>__{muddy}
<D>__{you know, i just might need you after all. aw right, in the trunk. you're gonna help me get mah unit back.}
<A>__{muddy pops it open. b&b climb in. muddy closes the trunk on them and walks to the front of the car. hold on the trunk.}
<P>__{butt head (o.s.)}
<D>__{boy, it sure is hard to score. huh huh huh.}
<A>__{muddy peels out.}
