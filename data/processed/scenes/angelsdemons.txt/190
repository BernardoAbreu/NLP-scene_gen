<A>__{the camerlengo crunches off the side of another building and drifts downward, fast, toward the crowd in st. peter's. his unconscious form smashes through a dozen people before slamming to the ground at one edge of the square. and in the sky above, the blast suddenly turns inward on itself, the heat and light and sound all seeming to suck back up into a perfect horizontal line, which then collapses in from the sides, until once again it is just a speck of white hot light that disappears into the night.}
