<L>__{interior dupea dining room night}
<A>__{nicholas dupea sits at the head of the table, being fed his dinner by a male nurse (spicer). bobby, at the opposite end of the table, is seated next to tita. unable to bear looking at his father, he glances over at catherine, seated next to carl on his right. she raises her eyes from her plate to ask him something, just as tita is moved to reminisce:}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{remember, bobby, what mother used to say when...}
<C>__{catherine}
<P>__{(to bobby)}
<D>__{how long have you been...}
<P>__{(to tita)}
<D>__{oh, excuse me...}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{no, it's all right, you go ahead...}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i was just going to ask robert how long he's been away from here.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{four or five years.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{no, the last time was three years ago.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{oh no, it's been much more than that.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{away from the piano, tita, you have no sense of time at all.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{i don't think that's true.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{it is true.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{besides being very rude.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{what have you been doing since then?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what have i been doing? different things, different jobs, here and there. nothing that interesting.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{and you no longer play at all?}
<A>__{bobby starts to reply and is interrupted by:}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{you know, just after i came back off tour with the betenthaller quartet, dad, myself and herbert had a summit conference about you...}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{oh, my, "a summit conference." i wonder where i was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i don't know where you were, penis envy.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{i hope i didn't hear that.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{at any rate, dad wanted to hire a private detective to ferret you out, and i said, "what for?" whatever the hell he's doing, even if it's a completely wasteful escapade, it's entirely his business. simple as that...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{well, i really appreciate it, carl.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{i don't think you should infer daddy was wrong in front of him...}
<A>__{she looks at spicer, pushing a spoon at nicholas's closed mouth.}
<C>__{tita }
<D>__{don't force him like that, spicer.}
<A>__{spicer lays the spoon down and begins eating his own dinner.}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(to catherine)}
<D>__{how long have you been staying here?}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{a couple of months.}
<A>__{he starts to ask another question and is again overridden by:}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{did you hear about my misfortune, robert?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{it's still nearly impossible for me to turn my neck. if i wanted to turn toward catherine, for instance, i'd first have to twist the whole base of my body around...}
<P>__{(demonstrating)}
<D>__{... like this...}
<A>__{tita gets up from the table and, taking her plate, exits to the kitchen. and as carl readjusts himself in his chair and takes a sip from his wine glass, bobby looks at catherine to find her looking at him. she quickly alters her gaze to carl.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i wouldn't mind doing a little work, if you're finished, and not too tired...}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{no, i'm finished...}
<P>__{(placing a hand on his stomach)}
<D>__{satiety is my father and mother.}
<A>__{finding he's amused himself and nobody else, he gets up and addresses bobby.}
<C>__{carl }
<D>__{she's tremendously gifted, this girl.}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(looking at her)}
<D>__{is she?}
<A>__{catherine stands up and, wanting to change the subject:}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{excuse me, i don't want to hear this...}
<A>__{she exits and carl, on his way out, pauses at bobby's chair.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i hope you feel at home, robert.}
<P>__{(patting him on the shoulder)}
<D>__{i'm really glad you're here.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{thanks, carl...}
<A>__{he looks down table to see spicer stacking his plate onto nicholas's and his eyes follow him as he, too, moves out of the dining room to the kitchen.}
<B>__{close on bobby}
<A>__{in extreme discomfort at being left alone with his father. he looks down at his plate, poking at the remainder of his dinner, then braves a look down the table.}
<B>__{on nicholas}
<A>__{looking back at him, his eyes devoid of interest or cognition.}
