<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{close on amoeba like creatures swimming in a pool.}
<L>__{int incubation room, laboratory night}
<A>__{ellie lifts her head away from the powerful microscope. the dark room is lit by flashlight. battery packs power the microscope. wu paces the room, regarding his eggs with dismay. sitting on their long tables with no moving wands above them no thermal sensors.}
<C>__{wu}
<D>__{what is taking arnold so long? this room is too cold. my eggs will be damaged.}
<A>__{ellie swings the lens to wu. not so interested but peers in politely.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{no sign of those berries. really interesting. there are indications of a similar virus in every tissue sample. but it's not in the ground. could i look at some of the discarded embryos?}
<A>__{wu reluctantly agrees. he opens a cabinet and brings her samples.}
<C>__{wu}
<D>__{i'm sure you'll find your virus ... or a similar one. all animals carry many viruses}
<A>__{in a dormant condition. it's}
<D>__{almost impossible to say with certainty which are the same strains.}
<A>__{ellie begins a test on a sample. she adds a reagent and marks up a slide. as she works:}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{and yet from what harding tells me, many of you animals have similar symptoms besides the microvesicles, a lack of hunger, loss of reproductive urges, sores in the mouth and gums.}
<A>__{wu waves his arms.}
<C>__{wu}
<D>__{what the hell does harding know? he's a veterinarian, not a pathologist.}
<A>__{back on control room arnold pushes his chair away from his console and claps his hands as muldoon walks in. muldoon asks hopefully.}
<C>__{muldoon}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{arnold points to the screen.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{that's it.}
<A>__{muldoon comes closer.}
<C>__{muldoon}
<D>__{that's what?}
<C>__{arnol}
<B>__{d}
<D>__{i found the command to restore the original code. it resets the linked parameters.}
<C>__{muldoon}
<D>__{the fences and the power?}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{right. and it does something else. it erases the code lines that refer to it. it destroys all evidence it was ever there.}
<C>__{muldoon}
<D>__{nedry could steal the eggs, get back and reset the whole show. no one would ever miss him.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{watch this.}
<A>__{arnold types in a command. the screen flickers and changes. arnold and muldoon look out the window as lights come on through out the park.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{hot damn!}
<C>__{muldoon}
<D>__{are the fences back on?}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{you bet they are. it will take a few seconds to get up to full power, because we've got fift}
<A>__{y miles of fence out there,}
<D>__{and the generator has to feed the capacitors along the way. but in a half a minute we'll be back in business.}
<A>__{arnold points to the transparent map of the park. on it, bright red lines snake out, moving throughout the park, as electricity surges through the fences.}
<C>__{muldoon}
<D>__{motion sensors?}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{got them too. it will be a few minutes while the computer counts. then i will tell you where grant and the kids are and you can go and get them. but every thing's working. half past ten and we've got the whole thing back up and running.}
<A>__{muldoon picks up a phone, shakes his head.}
<C>__{muldoon}
<D>__{just hiss.}
<A>__{back on grant and kids in tree grant snores. a mosquito buzzes around him. he waves him away and continues to sleep. in the distance, a tiny beeping. below the towering tree, across the f ield, a sensor beeps, it's green light blinks, and the beeping stops. in the high tree, the branches sway. grant and the kids sleep on. back on control room the glowing, glass map. arnold and muldoon stare at it.}
<C>__{muldoon}
<D>__{what is taking so damn long? where are they?}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{there's a lot of extraneous movement out there. branches blowing, birds, back ground movement. it may take, ah, okay, count's finished.}
<A>__{muldoon looks at arnold anxiously. arnold looks down.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{hmmmm. i don't see them. maybe they're out of range of a sensor.}
<C>__{muldoon}
<D>__{shit. i don't know where they are. i wish i could go out there but i haven't got anything to use on the rex. my rocket launcher's in the jeep nedry stole. and going out with a big gun in the dark would be suicide}
