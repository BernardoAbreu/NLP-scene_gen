<A>__{feminine hands apply the final decorative touches of blue icing to a wedding cake. then the hands set the plastic bride and groom on the pinnacle. the camera pulls back. barbara is viewing her handiwork, a wedding cake on a stainless steel wheeled cart. she's in the back part of the bakery. barbara is pleased with her creation. we travel with her as she rolls the cart out to the front of the store where chrissy is waiting on a huge man named harvey. she hands him a tiny box, which he takes meekly.}
