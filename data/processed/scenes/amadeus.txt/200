<A>__{this little wooden structure stands in a courtyard in the tenement by the weiden. inside, we see a table, chairs, a forte piano, bottles and a chaos of papers. strewn about in the chairs are the three actresses, giggling. schikaneder and mozart, both drunk, are singing the duet of the two bird people. the actor sings papageno and the composer, in a soprano voice, sings papagena at the keyboard. absurdly, they end up rubbing noses and fall on each other's necks.}
