<L>__{300 feet per second. then, at the last possible instant interior phoenix towers atrium ground floor night}
<A>__{chingg! drake deflects the arrow with his sword. it harmlessly falls to the floor, rolling a few yards away. on abigail, stunned, her expression melting into despair.}
<B>__{back to drake}
<A>__{swinging blade's sword around. plunging it into blade's side. as he pulls it back out again }
<B>__{blade}
<A>__{gasps, sinking downward. he's on his knees now, in shock. drake roars again shifting, conjuring up seventy centuries of violence and predation. and the nightmare shape that was only hinted at before, finally takes center stage. blood suffuses drake's flesh, turning his skin crimson. his canines elongate, his lower jaw distends. jagged bone spurs erupt all over his body like he's growing a suit of razor sharp thorns. he doesn't need a sword anymore. he's become a living weapon. drake is gone. now he is }
<B>__{the beast}
<A>__{drake swings the sword overhead. he's going to decapitate blade. and just as the sword reaches the top of its arc }
<B>__{zoe}
<A>__{emerges from the shadows behind drake, clutching a silver stake. she shoves it into drake's back, pushing with all the strength her little body can muster. drake staggers. the blow wasn't lethal, but it hurt all the same. he turns on zoe, enraged, his attention distracted for one crucial second on blade, summoning the last of his reserves. he pitches his body forward, managing to snag the end of the plague arrow. and before drake even realizes what is happening wham! blade sinks the plague arrow deep into drake's chest. drake drops the sword, turning back to face blade exhausted beyond measure, blade sags. inside drake's chest macro shot as the arrowhead dispense the bio weapon. we see the virus flooding drake's internal organs, causing them to blacken as his circulatory system carries it throughout his body. on drake's face, letting loose an inhuman scream, vomiting up a spray of blood mist. his monstrous features begin to melt, reshaping into his more familiar face. at the same time we go macr0 once more shrinking until we are amidst the spray of blood drake expelled. we continue shrinking until we are moving with the individual molecules of drake's breath as the plague virions latch onto them, causing them to blacken and become necrotic. moving with the twirling molecules until they are inhaled by danica, having retreated from her defeat by king. she clutches her throat. we can see the virus infiltrating her system as tiny black threads expand across her face. she sways, falling onto the floor. she reaches a beseeching hand towards king then dies, a final still born curse on her lips.}
<B>__{more vampires}
<A>__{are feeling the effects now too. one by one they drop, choking, going into convulsions. as they writhe on the floor, we watch the daystar virus ravaging their bodies.}
<B>__{back to blade and drake}
<A>__{drake slumps against the wall. hero and villain are now separated by only a few feet. both at death's door.}
<C>__{drake}
<D>__{well done, hunter. well done.}
<A>__{blade stares back. at this point, he's just trying to remain conscious. he's lost a ton of blood.}
<C>__{drake}
<D>__{you fought with honor }
<A>__{drake shudders, his breathing becoming increasingly shallow.}
<C>__{drake}
<D>__{ as i knew you would. the humans are coming for you, you know. in their eyes, you and i are the same. allow me one last indulgence, then }
<P>__{(gasping)}
<D>__{ a parting gift }
<A>__{drake grows still, his eyes locked on blade's.}
<B>__{abigail and king}
<A>__{rush to blade's side. zoe joins them. blade is dying, fading fast. abigail shakes blade }
<C>__{abigail}
<D>__{blade!}
<A>__{her voice sounds distant and muted, overridden by blade's own heartbeat which is fading up, dominating the soundtrack.}
<C>__{abigail}
<D>__{blade!!!}
<A>__{blade's eyes can't focus anymore. they're clouding over.}
<C>__{blade's pov}
<D>__{we drop away from abigail and king like we're falling down}
<A>__{a dark tunnel. then the world fades to white.}
