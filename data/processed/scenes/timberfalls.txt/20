<L>__{exterior base trail #1 day}
<A>__{the mountain is breathtaking. nature at its best. mike and sheryl have begun their ascent.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{it could be fun.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{not a chance. high school reunions serve only two purposes... to try to}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{rehash so called glory days if you were popular or to gloat if you were a spaz and are now filthy rich, banging a super model.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{so what were you?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{me? i was a stoner.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{so what does that mean?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{how the hell am i supposed to remember? i was high all the time.}
<A>__{sheryl swallows some water, checks her compass. sweat rolls down mike's forehead, stinging his eyes. sheryl doesn't have that problem. she's wearing a red bandana.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{where'd you get that bandana?}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{it's cute, right? i stopped by that army navy store on grover yesterday. keeps the sweat out of your eyes.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{and when you were buying it, you didn't think that maybe...}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{oh...well...it was the last one...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{the last one?}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{the entire army navy store... sold out?}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{completely. there was some sort of run on bandanas at the last minute.}
<A>__{sheryl stifles a chuckle. mike shakes his head, then... she pulls out a gray bandana, hands it to him.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{here... you big baby.}
<A>__{sheryl turns, as she does... mike pinches her behind, she playfully shrieks, hustles away from him, but he pursues her, as they both crack up, they spill off the trail... off the path... mike and sheryl continue their horseplay, when... sheryl looks down, screams! a bloody, mutilated fox lays inside a rusted bear trap. the steel jaws of the trap have sliced the body in two. the kill looks fresh.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{fucking nasty.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{looks like it's a, or was, a fox. come on.}
<A>__{mike and sheryl head back to the path. angle on the mutilated, bloody fox.}
