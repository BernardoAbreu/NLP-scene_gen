<C>__{desmond}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{irene}

<D>__{i just thought i ought to tell you.}
<C>__{desmond}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{stanley watches her leave.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{i doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. i could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to portland.}
<C>__{desmond}
<D>__{i think that's a good idea.}
