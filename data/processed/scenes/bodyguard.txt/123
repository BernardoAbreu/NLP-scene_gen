<A>__{special agents court and minella are watching the general manager of the supply house as he pries the top off a huge canister marked "industrial detergent." the general manager lifts the lid to reveal white powder. he talks animatedly and gestures around the warehouse. court listens, nodding. minella spoons some of the powder into a plastic bag and seals it. over this we hear court's voice, filtered as on a telephone line.}
