<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{you forgot to wash your hands.}
<A>__{he throws him against the sinks. gene washes his hands. mr. smith leans against the sink next to him in the mirror above the sink, gene sees the stall door swings open. gustino is huddled in the corner, feet up on the toilet. mr. smith doesn't notice.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{i've got faith in you, mr. watson. i know you're not just a regular guy, see, i know that. even if you don't know it yourself. maybe that's why i picked you.}
