<L>__{exterior storage shed day}
<A>__{melvin dances merrily, and noisily , on the metal rooftop.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{way to go! dumb fucking worms! now haul ass over here, man! me next! get me off of here...!}
<A>__{the flimsy shed seems almost to explode as a furious creature roars up inside. the walls buckle out. the whole structure sags. melvin scrambles to peak of the roof.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{oh shit! oh, god! help!}
<A>__{as the unseen creature thrashes around inside the shed, the walls topple outward and the roof drops to the ground like a pancake. melvin has lost all self control and just keeps screaming. val pulls along side, jumps down onto the tread, and reaches out to melvin. but just as they join hands, the creature hits the roof from beneath, dragging it several feet. val is yanked off the bulldozer and lands with nelvin on the roof! the creature slams into the roof repeatedly, but the corrugated metal is both light and resilient. it bends, but the frustrated monster can't get enough "bite" to tear through it. val and melvin straddle the peak of the roof, trying desperately to hang on as it heaves up, buckling like a bronco. earl scrambles into the bulldozer driver's seat and heads after them at full throttle, the big diesel roaring. melvin and val prepare to jump onto the bulldozer, but just before it reaches them the roof suddenly starts to slide like some mad flying carpet, carried from beneath by a creature! val hangs on like a rodeo rider, struggling to keep fear crazed melvin from tumbling off.}
