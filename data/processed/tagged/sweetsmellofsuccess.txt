<A>__{the quintet. as the dissolve clears, a clatter of polite applause greets the end of a previous number. camera is on the bandstand, moving smoothly through the group of five musicians as the rhythm of a new number is set up: first the leader (a guitarist) snaps his fingers, giving the tempo to...the bass, who "walks" with the beat, bringing in...the drums, which start a quiet, insistent wire brush background for...the cello and the flute, whose introductory phrases, set the stage for...}
<B>__{steve dallas}
<A>__{...the guitar, the leader again. it comes in after this short preamble with the first statement of melody. (the tune has a faint echo of significance because it is one of the themes of the film, already heard as a phrase in the background score of the title music.) camera lingers a moment on the guitarist, steve dallas. he is a youth of pleasant, intelligent appearance. he plays with the intent air of the contemporary jazz musician who takes his work very seriously indeed and affects a much greater interest in the music and his fellow musicians than in the listening audience.}

<A>__{a close shot. sidney has just entered the club, strolling into the vestibule near the entrance. he wears an expression of oddly unsuitable antagonism, as he looks forward...}

<D>__{at the bar sidney...}
<A>__{but sidney has moved away from her. d'angelo he is at the bar, listening with satisfaction to the music, watching the performers and studying the audience. sidney comes up behind him. we see sidney's eyes flick from d'angelo towards the bandstand and back again. then, as he takes the stool next to d'angelo, he assumes a different manner, a sulky resentment. d'angelo sees sidney.}

<B>__{closer angle}
<A>__{this is susan hunsecker. she wears an expensive mink coat. it is oddly in contrast with her personality; the face is sensitive and intelligent, but childlike and tragic. a girl in adolescence already burdened with problems beyond her capacity. over scene, the music continues. susan shifts her position, knowing that the session will soon be at an end and that the musicians will be coming backstage.}

<A>__{a medium long shot. at a booth on the other side of the bar sits a dapper gentleman with a twinkle of malice in his eyes. he has been watching the altercation with keen interest and satisfaction. elwell gives some instructions to a waiter who is serving him with drinks, pointing towards sidney.}

<D>__{if it were that easy, you wouldn't find an empty phone booth for the next two hours...}
<B>__{sidney}
<A>__{a close shot. while elwell continues, he is not looking at sidney. elwell's expression of dislike of hunsecker is not overemphatic; but sidney senses, nevertheless, that it is very real and this gives him a new idea.}

<P>__{(a pause, then:)}

<P>__{(continuing, casually)}
<D>__{then you're really washed up with hunsecker...?}
<B>__{reverse angle}
<A>__{the nature of elwell's reading tastes is also not lost on sidney. with his eyes glancing at the magazine, sidney now accepts the original offer to sit down. he produces the slip of paper that bartha rejected, offering it as illustration.}

<D>__{this is how much i'm washed with j.j....}
<A>__{as elwell reads, sidney continues giving a passing scrutiny apparently casual to a picture of a girl on the magazine cover.}

<D>__{look, otis, i make no brief for my bilious private life, but he's got the morals of a guinea pig and the scruples of a gangster.}
