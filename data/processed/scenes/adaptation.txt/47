<A>__{kaufman drives slowly past barnes and noble, squints in the window, sees the tattooed cashier. he passes burger king, sees a pretty employee, the same at starbucks. glassed in women on display, different types, different attitudes. kaufman stops in front of the california pizza kitchen. alice and her orange hair glow through the window. he hesitates, then drives off.}

<D>__{a beautiful orange orchid blooms in time lapse }
<A>__{donald enters. kaufman ignores him, continues typing. donald dawdles, picks up the orchid thief, flips through it.}
<D>__{kaufman (v.o.) (cont'd) the camera circles it, revealing how lovely and perfect and sweet and inviting and delicate and...}
<C>__{donald}

<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{what do you want, donald?}
<C>__{donald}
<D>__{nothing. i just read about that swamp ape that supposedly lives in the swamp? like bigfoot? you should put that in your script, like, killing people or something. that'd be very, very cool.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{why are you in here now?}
<C>__{donald}
<D>__{nothing, i was just... oh, one thing, i need a cool way to kill people. don't worry! for my script! ha ha!}
<A>__{kaufman stares at donald, rubs his eyes, then:}
<C>__{kaufman}

<C>__{donald}
<D>__{that's kinda good. i like that.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{see, i was kidding, donald.}
<C>__{donald}
