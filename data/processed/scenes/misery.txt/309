<A>__{the first page of the book, as paul opens it. it's a newspaper clipping as is almost all of what follows. a small article: simply a birth announcement for anne marie wilkes. paul turns the page. this headline reads: "investment banker carl wilkes dies in freak fall." "usc nursing student dies in freak fall." that's the headline on the next page. now: "miss wilkes is nursing school honors graduate." paul turns the page. manchester, new hampshire, union leader: "ernest gonyar, 79, dies after long illness." now that phrase seems to be what catches our eye "after long illness" is from the next article. "long illness" from the one after that. then, on the next page, a variation: "short illness." now we're in pennsylvania: "new hospital staff announced." and here come those phrases again on page after page "after long illness." "after long illness." "after long illness."}
