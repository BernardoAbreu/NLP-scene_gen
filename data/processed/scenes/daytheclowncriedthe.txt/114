<L>__{interior cell day}
<A>__{the cell is a small, bare cubicle containing only a cot and an open toilet. in the wall, fronting on the prison yard, there is a small barred window. helmut stops pacing and moves over to it, and looks out. the camera swings so that it is shooting past helmut's head through the window. at the far end of the yard we can see the windowless stone buildings. as helmut stares out at them, we hear approaching footsteps. helmut stiffens, turns toward the door as the sound of the footsteps grows louder and louder. the camera swings toward the door as it opens to reveal captain curt runkel, a slender, impeccably groomed and thoroughly nazified officer of the elite s.s. he is the embodiment of all hitlerian ideals. runkel strides into the cell.}
<C>__{runkel}
<P>__{(over shoulder to guard at door)}
<D>__{close the door, and wait out there.}
<A>__{guard closes the door. runkel studies helmut coldly. without taking his eyes off helmut, he pulls out a cigarette case, takes out cigarette, lights it and slowly inhales.}
<C>__{runkel}
<D>__{you're a remarkable man. very remarkable.}
<A>__{helmut stirs uneasily.}
<C>__{runkel}
<D>__{have you any idea where you are?}
<A>__{helmut shakes his head.}
<C>__{runkel}
<D>__{auschwitz. this is auschwitz.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{mean anything to you?}
<P>__{(before helmut can answer)}
<D>__{you may have observed we're enlarging our facilities.}
<A>__{he moves over to the window and looks out, puffing slowly on his cigarette.}
<C>__{runkel}
<D>__{still a great deal of work to be done.}
<P>__{(proudly)}
<D>__{it's going to be our most efficient, most modern prison.}
<P>__{(he turns and smiles)}
<D>__{and, i might add, most unique.}
<P>__{(walks back towards}
<D>__{helmut, studying him}
<P>__{carefully)}
<C>__{runkel}
<D>__{yes, you are a remarkable man. i always wonder about remarkable men.}
<P>__{(then evenly)}
<D>__{why did you come here?}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{i explained. i got locked in the boxcar and...}
<C>__{runkel}
<P>__{(cuts in still bland)}
<D>__{ah, yes. an accident. unavoidable i suppose.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{i was taking care i mean, the commandant requested me to take care of the children.}
<C>__{runkel}
<P>__{(a slight note of mockery)}
<D>__{the commandant!}
<A>__{runkel tosses his cigarette on the floor and very deliberately grinds it out with his boot.}
<C>__{runkel}
<D>__{i've spoken to your commandant. he hs you listed as an escaped prisoner.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{escaped! but...}
<C>__{runkel}
<P>__{(finishing it for him)}
<D>__{... it was an accident.}
<P>__{(his face close to helmut's)}
<D>__{are you one of them, clown?}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(terrorized at the thought of death)}
<D>__{no... no! i'm not one of them. i'm not !}
<A>__{runkel smiles, moves away from helmut.}
<C>__{runkel}
<D>__{you misunderstand completely. the judas goat is never killed. he isn't worth killing.}
<P>__{(moves to cell door)}
<D>__{i'm just asking you to lead them.}
<A>__{another angle favoring helmut his eyes plead, "no. i can't do it. no."}
<C>__{runkel}
<D>__{not... even to save your own life?}
<A>__{for a brief moment, helmut struggles to find the courage to stand up to runkel but he has no courage and he sinks slowly to his knees, his head bowed. close shot runkel}
<C>__{runkel}
<P>__{(victorious)}
<D>__{i'm glad to see you're not a self appointed martyr.}
<A>__{two shot helmut, runkel runkel towers above helmut who sits back on his haunches, leaning against the wall.}
<C>__{runkel}
<D>__{just think! now you're really one of us.}
<A>__{the truth of runkel's remark hits helmut like a devastating blow. he turns his face to the wall in shame. runkel walks to the door, raps on it, the guard outside swings it open.}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(attempting to get to his feet)}
<D>__{sir... sir... could i... could i have a little time with them before ... before...}
<A>__{his voice trails off. runkel looks at helmut while he thinks it over. he moves back to the middle of the cell.}
<C>__{runkel}
<D>__{yes. yes, of course.}
<P>__{(he looks at his watch)}
<D>__{i can give you about half an hour.}
<P>__{(a little smile lights his face)}
<D>__{you see, we're not heartless men here.}
