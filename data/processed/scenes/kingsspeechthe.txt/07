<L>__{exterior wembley stadium day}
<A>__{elevated shot looking down on a sea of dripping black umbrellas hiding the spectators from view. bertie and elizabeth takes their places in a row of gilded chairs with the other dignitaries. they are: king george v a barrel chested man with naval beard and uniform, accompanied by his wife. queen mary an elegant but icy grande dame. dr cosmo lang a tall, unctuous, churchman with a high, domed, balding head, and a perpetual expression of moral superiority. winston churchill a politician of sixty, as portly as lang is lean. they are bantering rivals in ambition. stanley baldwin the prime minister of the day. heavy browed. his hair, as always, parted down the middle. neville chamberlain chancellor of the exchequer. tall, thin, lugubrious, with the expression of a quizzical chicken hawk. a bbc technician places a huge imposing microphone suspended on springs next to the stadium equipment. it looks frightening, even to us. bertie's shoulders brace as though expecting a blow. elizabeth sees his terror.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{why wasn't he told?}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{ten million people listening around the world, mam. possibly more.}
<P>__{(as though bertie didn't exist)}
<D>__{his brother, and father, have been broadcasting since last year.}
<A>__{the king, growing impatient, hisses:}
<C>__{king george v}
<D>__{get on with it. show what you're made of!}
<A>__{bertie moves forward diffidently, without an ounce of confidence, knowing deep within he's doomed. his stomach knots, chest muscles contract, constricting his breath.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{luh luh lords, la la ladies, gen tell men.}
<A>__{it is a shock to realize this is a man with a profound stutter. a man who cannot speak in public. lang whispers to churchill. when lang whispers, everyone can hear.}
<C>__{cosmo lang}
<D>__{i wouldn't miss his highness' maiden voyage for all the world. and on such an important occasion.}
<A>__{lang really is a piece of work. for ease of reading, bertie's stutter is not indicated from this point on in the script.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{no doubt you wish the prince of wales was standing before you today.}
<A>__{pov a sea of dripping umbrellas. no response. this is going to be a torment for him, and his audience.}
