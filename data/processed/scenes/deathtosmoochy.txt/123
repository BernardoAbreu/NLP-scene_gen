<L>__{exterior street}
<A>__{a few moments later sheldon rounds the corner. he looks down the street and sees no sign of burke. he notices an alley by an abandoned building.}
<L>__{exterior alley continuous action}
<A>__{sheldon walks slowly into the alley, gun drawn. suddenly, burke jumps out from behind some boxes. he whacks sheldon's head with a garbage can lid. the gun goes flying. burke goes for it, but sheldon is quickly on his feet and pounces on him. the two men fight it out. burke manages to get on top of sheldon and starts to strangle him.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{you fucking point a gun at me? a gun i gave you as a gift?! where's your fucking etiquette?}
<A>__{just as sheldon begins to lose consciousness, we hear a gunshot. burke looks up. nora stands there, pointing sheldon's gun directly at him.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{let him go.}
<A>__{burke just looks at her.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{now. before i pump one in that grecian formula scalp of yours.}
<A>__{burke smirks as he releases sheldon. sheldon jumps up and takes the gun from nora. he shakily points it at burke.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{you know something, kid? you've turned out to be an incredible pain in the ass.}
<A>__{burke slowly stands up, brushing off his suit.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{you were behind the spinner hit, weren't you?}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{that was a tragic mistake.}
<P>__{(shakes head sadly)}
<D>__{if only one could turn back time...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but what the hell, it's just one less mick in the world.}
<A>__{he laughs.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{you son of a bitch.}
<A>__{sheldon cocks the gun.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{oh my. what are you gonna do? kill me? that wouldn't be very smoochy like behavior.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{you're right. there's just one thing...}
<A>__{sheldon tears off the remains of his tattered costume and steps out of it.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{i'm not smoochy.}
<A>__{sheldon is shaking as he extends the gun to burke's head.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{i finally realized we're living in a different jungle.}
<A>__{burke suddenly looks fearful, as does nora.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{no, sheldon.}
<A>__{sheldon closes his eyes as he tries to summon up the courage to pull the trigger.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{sheldon!}
<A>__{suddenly, there's a voice from behind.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{don't do it, shel.}
<A>__{sheldon turns around. it's tommy and her boys.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<P>__{(sternly)}
<D>__{stay out of it, tommy. this is my business.}
<A>__{tommy walks closer to sheldon.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{no more killin', shel. enough's enough. don't destroy who you are for this piece of shit. you mean something to the kids. don't take smoochy away from the kids.}
<A>__{tommy extends her hand for the gun. sheldon looks down at the gun. he can't believe he's even holding it. he hands it to tommy.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{i don't know how i got pushed this far.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{you're only human, shel. the important thing is... you never went over the cliff. you're a good boy. for some of us... it's too late.}
<A>__{tommy pats sheldon's shoulder affectionately.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{we'll take it from here, kid, you run along with your girl. get on with your life.}
<A>__{sheldon looks over at burke, who's petrified.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{tommy, you're not going to }
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{don't worry. sometimes even a rat deserves a little mercy.}
<A>__{sheldon and nora take a final look at burke before walking out of the alley. burke is wide eyed with fear as tommy's boys advance on him. just as they round the corner there is the sound of two gunshots. sheldon looks at nora.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{bus backfire.}
<A>__{she pats him on the back.}
