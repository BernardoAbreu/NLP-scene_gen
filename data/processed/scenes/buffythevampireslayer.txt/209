<D>__{it means never having to say you're sorry! and you blow it all off for that slut?! what about my needs?!}
<A>__{pike suddenly grabs benny, holds him tightly in a brotherly embrace. benny is thrown slightly by this. still holding him, pike pitches onto the table, driving the leg shard through benny's back. pike still holds benny as he twitches and screams, dying. finally, he lets go, gets up. he looks a little dazed, a little lost. a window shattering far behind him pulls his eyes back into focus, and he goes to help. angle kimberly sitting by a wall, tiny and silent amid the carnage.}
