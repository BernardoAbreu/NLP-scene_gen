<L>__{exterior fuji maru night}
<A>__{trillian hears the saipan's engine come to life. she hits the ignition on the jet ski. right next to her something drops from the deck of the saipan into the water. finnegan clambers up in front of her. his pulse rifle still in hand.}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{where's you friend?}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{he's not coming...}
<A>__{the saipan strains on its leashes. engines gunning. finnegan swings his rifle around. opens up on the tie lines. all the tie lines shred. the saipan starts to break free.}
<C>__{finnegan }
<D>__{hold on!}
<A>__{he guns the ski...and it stalls. the jet ski stalls. goes dead in the water.}
<C>__{finnegan }
<D>__{oh shit!!}
<A>__{nearby, the water swirls violently. he hammers the starter button.}
<C>__{finnegan }
<D>__{come on!!}
<A>__{the engine stutters. he tries again.}
<C>__{finnegan }
<D>__{come on!!}
<A>__{another stutter. more water swirls, getting closer now. but the third time's a charm. the jet ski comes to life and shoots off along the side of the ship. just as a tentacle comes shooting out of the water. finnegan fires at it, blowing it to pieces. the last tie line snaps. the saipan lurches away from the fuji maru. the jammed steering sticks force the rudder to turn it in a tight circle.}
