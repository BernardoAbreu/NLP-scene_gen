<A>__{bud comes into the bedroom. as he heads for the bathroom, fran stirs slightly, opens her eyes.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{who was that?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne. like some?}
<C>__{fran}
<P>__{(shaking her head)}
<D>__{would you mind opening the window?}
<A>__{she turns off the electric blanket as bud crosses to the window, pushes it up. then a thought strikes him, and he looks at fran suspiciously.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{now don't go getting any ideas, miss kubelik.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{i just want some fresh air.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{it's only one story down the best you can do is break a leg.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{so they'll shoot me like a horse.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(approaching the bed)}
<D>__{please, miss kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{who'd care?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i would.}
<C>__{fran}
<P>__{(sleepily)}
<D>__{why can't i ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(ruefully)}
<D>__{yeah. well that's the way it crumbles, cookie wise. go to sleep.}
<A>__{fran closes her eyes. bud returns to the bathroom, picks up his razor, starts to shave. but something seems to be wrong with the razor and unscrewing it, he realizes that there is no blade. sheepishly, he takes out the blade he hid in his shirt pocket, inserts it in his razor, screws it shut. then he resumes shaving.}
