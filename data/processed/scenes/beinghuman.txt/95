<L>__{exterior camp day}
<A>__{hector and andre are walking through the half built village. andre is carrying hector's possessions, a rolled up carpet and a bolt of colorful cloth. we feel an echo of the days when hector was a slave, walking two paces behind with his master's possessions. hector finds what he is looking for. francisco is working on a shelter for himself and ursula, with the help of some slaves. hector approaches him, making another attempt to heal wounds from his past.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i have a carpet and some cloth... i thought if we worked together we could make a better shelter...}
<A>__{francisco barely stops his work to reply.}
<C>__{francisco}
<D>__{if it's a joke it's a poor one.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{at least ask dona ursula...}
<C>__{francisco}
<D>__{i don't have to ask her... i know she would agree with me... leave us alone.}
<A>__{his stubborn rejection of hector reveals just how strong their friendship once was.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{well... would you take my cloth, at least?}
<C>__{francisco}
<D>__{keep it and build your own hovel somewhere else... leave us alone...!}
<A>__{then from along the beach the sound of raised voices distracts them. they see some figures, laden with supplies, running off into the forest. others are following them, discharging muskets, shouting for the deserters to stop. hector and francisco walk briskly in the direction of the trouble. they see two of the deserters being overtaken by their pursuers. the rest make their escape into the jungle.}
