<L>__{interior dietrich's living room continuous action}
<A>__{the thugs admire the loft dominated by an enormous, in progress mural and stunning glass bricked floor.}
<C>__{aldo}
<D>__{helluva place, dietrich. so what's the big surprise?}
<A>__{archer emerges. the men are stunned the women beam.}
<C>__{fitch}
<D>__{are you crazy? you're going to bring the feds down on all of us!}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{archer doesn't want you, he wants me! but i'm going to get him first with your help.}
<C>__{aldo}
<D>__{archer's a damn celebrity now he's untouchable and you're radioactive.}
<A>__{he turns to leave. archer wheels him around and smashes him into the wall. aldo goes for his gun, but archer's too quick he strips him of it. the four bodyguards draw their weapons and surround archer.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{you wanna face off with castor troy? come on, then! come on! 'cause i've had a real bad day...}
<A>__{four against one and everyone's sweating but archer. one by one, the bodyguards back off. archer points the gun at aldo then smiles and hands it back.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{you're all forgetting who the real enemy is.}
<P>__{(to aldo)}
<D>__{six months ago, jon archer hauled you in for questioning. he rattled you so bad you shit your armani suit right there in the interrogation room.}
<A>__{aldo blanches how did castor know that? fitch laughs.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{you laugh, fitch the way archer laughed at your last arraignment, when you got down on your knees and tried to blow your way to freedom.}
<A>__{stunned, fitch cringes as everybody cracks up.}
<C>__{dietrich}
<D>__{we all have a reason to hate jon archer. we all want to see him dead }
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{and nobody's untouchable if we say he's not.}
<A>__{the thugs exchange a glance... reading each other... considering.}
<C>__{dietrich}
<D>__{it's all worked out. caz has archer's routine down cold.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{we start with your basic kidnapping. then a little surgery.}
<C>__{fitch}
<D>__{surgery?}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{i'm going to rearrange his face in a way you won't believe.}
<C>__{aldo}
<D>__{you're an evil bitch, caz. but you've got balls of titanium. count us in.}
<A>__{archer sighs with relief pleased with his performance.}
<C>__{dietrich}
<D>__{come on let's drink to it!}
<A>__{full screen blue capsule dietrich cracks it open powder sifts into a big high ball glass filled with mescal. he hands it to archer.}
<C>__{dietrich}
<D>__{how about one of your famous toasts, caz?}
<A>__{they all look expectantly at archer... he's at a loss.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{to old jobs, new jobs and uh blow jobs?}
<A>__{silence then they crack up. reluctantly, archer swallows the tumbler of mescal... he fights back the urge to puke.}
<C>__{livia}
<D>__{enough business, caz. let's dance.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{sorry... i don't...}
<A>__{she drags him onto the glass floor. cindee puts on some music as archer's head begins to spin. the girls start "dancing," grinding archer between their taut bodies. he tries to avoid it, but livia kisses him hot, moist.}
<C>__{livia}
<D>__{remember the charger's game, caz? the owners box? we did it four times.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{sure i remember... once a quarter, right?}
<A>__{archer's eyes fall on the series of abstract paintings. the twisted renderings make his head spin worse... as he starts to hallucinate... surrounded by enemies he struggles to regain control of his battered psyche.}
<C>__{livia}
<D>__{caz? are you okay?}
<A>__{he pulls away and stumbles down the stairs toward the kitchen.}
<C>__{dietrich}
<D>__{when even castor troy can't handle a tab of quantrex...}
<P>__{(raises his glass)}
<D>__{that, dear friends, is the first sorry whiff of old age.}
