<A>__{low angle...looking up at orthanc...the tower of isengard, gleaming in the moonlight. the camera rises to reveal the once beautiful gardens are not a pitted wasteland...with smoke and fire billowing out of numerous tunnels and vent holes that litter the forecourt of orthanc. strange guttural chants echo up from deep underground. the camera is rising...a small moth flutters into shot...and leads the camera towards the summit or orthanc. gandalf lies slumped against the wall at the very top of orthanc, surrounded by a sheer 500 foot drop. he looks weak and frail...and is seemingly asleep. the moth flutters close to gandalf. his hand suddenly moves at lighting speed and snatches the moth. gandalf brings his hand close to his face and opens it. the moth sits on the palm of his hand as gandalf mutter strange words in a foreign tongue. close on: the moth's face... seemingly listening. it suddenly flutters away. camera follows the moth off the orthanc summit, but drops past the moth...falling down, down, towards the pitted wasteland, straight into a fiery red tunnel!}
