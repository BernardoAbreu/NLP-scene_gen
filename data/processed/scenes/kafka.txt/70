<B>__{the library}
<A>__{with the brightness of the laboratory facing him through its open door. horrible sounds coming from in there. the hidden bomb case almost time.}
<B>__{kafka}
<A>__{running again, through the maze of corridors. he hears running footsteps behind him looks back to see ekman running after him. ekman catches up but runs past kafka in his panic to escape out onto a metal walkway around a central area of offices.}
<B>__{the laboratory}
<A>__{murnau can't be seen, only the deranged men huddled closely around the operating table. the hidden bomb case abruptly stops ticking.}
<B>__{the central offices}
<A>__{the floors shudder as the boom in the laboratory is heard and felt. the metal walkway breaks and ekman goes sliding off it while kafka manages to hang on. he ducks his face down as glass from all the surrounding office windows shatters and showers and then paper starts sailing down all around. literally a hailstorm of documents. on the floor below where he fell, ekman tries to stand, but the falling flurry of paper keeps him at bay. he waves his hands wildly trying to see his way through it all, but it's too much. now his feet are trapped in it. it's starting to rise around his legs. papers are fluttering down from floors and floors of surrounding offices above, filling the air. ekman suffocates and drowns and disappears in the paper piling up around him one lone arm and hand the last we see of him.}
<B>__{the laboratory}
<A>__{totally wrecked and jutting out of the broken walls are burst pipes spurting red, blue, and black ink everywhere.}
<B>__{the central offices}
<A>__{kafka is managing to climb back onto the unsafe metal walkway when zing! a bullet ricochets near him. the assistants! they've nearly fallen through another doorway where the walkway on that side broke, but got each other stuck in the door just in time. one of them is wildly firing a revolver in kafka's direction. the other tries to grab it and both fire it together in all directions. kafka runs away, avoiding a snake of broken wire, flipping about, sparking off the metal. the assistants, shoving each other, extricate themselves back through their doorway to find another way to chase kafka.}
<B>__{the laboratory}
<A>__{the burst ink pipes drip empty. the sound of maniacal laughter abruptly stops. the ink has filled the lab halfway to the ceiling. it's covered everything and every ... body. a last bubble pops, leaving a lake of ink with a surface smooth as glass.}
