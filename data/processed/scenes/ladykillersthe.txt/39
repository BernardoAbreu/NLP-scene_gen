<A>__{we are looking down past the distinctive pylon mounted yellow letters: waffle.}
<L>__{interior waffle house day}
<A>__{the band of miscreants is seated around a table with cups of coffee. dorr's wardrobe makes no concession to the informality of the setting; he still wears his cape and a black string tie. his manner is more mournful even than usual:}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{oh my. oh my my my my my. this is a severe setback. i am distraught. i am more than distraught, i am devastated. oh my, this is quite the monkey wrench heaved into the meticulously engineered construct of our little escapade.}
<C>__{lump}
<D>__{yeah, it fucks things up.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{i am beside myself. i am at a positive loss for words.}
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{you still talkin' okay though.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{have you all decided?}
<A>__{dorr's intensely mournful agitation is brought to bear upon her:}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{oh madam, we must have waffles. we must all have waffles forthwith!}
<A>__{they hand in their menus.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...oh we must think. we must all have waffles and think, each and every one of us to the very best of his ability! perhaps if you apologized to the man and gave him flowers, or perhaps a fruit basket, with a card depicting a misty seascape and inscribed with a sentiment.}
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{shit, man, it ain't about apologizin'! he fired me 'cause i'm black!}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{he can't do that. you could sue him. open and shut case.}
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{fuckin' a.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{this is not 1952.}
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{man's a fuckin' bigot.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{well then, perhaps, surely, a chocolate assortment has been known to warm the heart of even the most hardened misanthrope, especially if it's a premium chocolate, imported, say, from switzerland, or the netherlands, or some other of the so called "low" countries be they dutch or flemish or walloon }
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{walloon my ass, the man ain't gonna roll over for a fuckin' candy bar!}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{i'm afraid there's a setback on the tunneling front too. we've run into a pretty large rock, and }
<C>__{general}
<D>__{ rock!}
<A>__{all turn to look at the general. he continues to stare at a spot in space. he slowly releases some inhaled cigarette smoke, murmuring:}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{...very bad.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{oh my my, it seems that the poet was right: troubles never singly come.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{oh, we can get through the rock, no worries there. simplest thing in the world. why we blow right through it; i've got a pyro license, we bore a hole in the rock, pack in a little plastique; igneous blows pretty good, and we }
<C>__{lump}
<D>__{is he gonna want a piece of the action?}
<A>__{all turn to look at lump.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{...who?}
<A>__{lump hesitates, looking at the inquiring faces that surround him.}
<C>__{lump}
<D>__{...igneous?}
<A>__{a female voice:}
<C>__{mountain girl }
<D>__{hello clark. am i ordering the prima cord?}
<A>__{the men look up at her.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{yes, mountain, we were just talking about that, and some plastique.}
<A>__{all the men are staring at her, agog.}
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{...the fuck is this?}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{this is mountain girl. mountain is my right hand. she helps me with ordnance. helps me with damn near everything.}
<A>__{the men stare.}
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{...you brought your bitch to the waffle house?!}
<A>__{there is tension in the air. dorr clears his throat.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{i confess myself to be puzzled as well. i thought we all understood that, so far as our little enterprise is concerned, mum, as the saying would have it, is the word }
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{of course. i understand that. but this is mountain...}
<A>__{he chuckles.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{...i don't keep secrets from mountain. that's not how you maintain a loving, caring relationship.}
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{...you brought your bitch to the waffle house?}
<A>__{he looks around.}
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{...man brings his bitch to the waffle house!}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{look, you, i will thank you to stop referring to mountain that way. she's the other half of my life.}
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{everybody lookin' at me like i'm a fuck up, losin' that sorry ass job, and this motherfucker bring his bitch to the waffle house!}
<A>__{pancake lunges across the table, sending dishes clattering to the floor as he grabs gawain by the shirt.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{you son of a bitch punk! shut your goddamn mouth!}
<A>__{he shakes him vigorously and rears back to take a swing at him. gawain draws a gun.}
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{come and get me motherfuck! come on, baby, let's get it on!}
<A>__{mountain starts screaming. people look, aghast.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{gentlemen, please!}
<A>__{the other men pry pancake and gawain apart.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...gentlemen, this sort of behavior does you no credit in the eyes of your colleagues, or in those of the other patrons of this waffle house!}
<A>__{pancake grumbles as he composes himself and straighten his clothes.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{...nobody talks to mountain girl that way. she had an abusive family!}
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{fuck you, man.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{little punk. i got syrup on my safari jacket.}
<A>__{he embraces mountain, who continues to sob quietly.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{gentlemen, i propose that we consider the matter of this woman, mountain water, to be }
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{mountain girl.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{i am so very sorry. i propose that we consider this matter to be closed, and we shall chose to trust her, since we now have no choice, and since she shall share only in mr. pancake's portion of the booty.}
<A>__{over the shoulder of the quietly weeping mountain girl:}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{of course. wouldn't have it any other way.}
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{damn right you won't.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{up yours, punk.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{gentlemen! and the manner of disposing of our igneous impediment is also settled. that leaves only the question of gawain retrieving his job.}
<C>__{lump}
<D>__{couldn't you just bribe the guy?}
<A>__{all turn to look at lump.}
