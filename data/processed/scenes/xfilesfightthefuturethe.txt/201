<A>__{scully's head and arms push up through the vent where mulder first entered. the ice and snow surrounding it, which had created the bubble structure, have melted and fallen. so that above scully's larger hole has opened up to the surface. the air is full of condensation, swirling around them. angle from above through the hole in the ice where, through the swirling steam we see mulder push scully clear of the vent. climbing free himself now. when the surface they are upon shudders and quakes. as if it has come unloosed, destabilized. and with this comes a mighty force of steam from the vent mulder and scully just crawled from. blasting up past them with terrible hissing force. causing mulder to throw scully away from its superheated energy. pulling her up the now climbable embankment created by the melting snow; pulling her toward the surface of the ice sheet.}
