<L>__{interior malik's house day}
<A>__{talley shoulders inside on the heels of the tactical team through drifting gun smoke and lancing sunlight. swat cops are cuffing malik even though he's already dead of a self inflicted gunshot wound; malik's wife is sprawled on the couch where she has been dead for fourteen hours; two tac officers are trying to stop the geyser of arterial blood that sprays from the neck of malik's nine year old son even as one of them screams for the paramedics talley is numb; it's all too much, too heavy, too horrible. he kneels between to the tactical cops and takes the boy's hand. he stares into the boy's eyes, and the boy stares back. the child's face grows pale as he drains of blood. we hear his heart beating. we hear it slow. we hear it stop. talley stares at the dead boy. the dead boy's lifeless eyes stare at nothing.}
