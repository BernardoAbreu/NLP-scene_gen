<A>__{the column of marchers has finally reached the island ridge, where they are silhouetted against the setting sun. they're taking a break, sprawled out on rocks or over the ground. malcolm sits next to kelly, who's sitting on a log.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{she doesn't look at him, just gets up and walks away, going to sit over next to sarah. malcolm watches, pained, but sarah puts an arm around her and makes a "she's okay" gesture to malcolm. at the ridge, roland steps up to the very edge and peers into the island interior. from his vantage point, he's able to see all the way to the far side of the island, a rim of herd black cliff, miles away. between here and the cliffs there is nothing but gently undulating jungle. he refers to one of the satellite recon photos.}

<D>__{looks like the worker village is down in there, about a mile and a half northeast from the base of these cliffs.}
<A>__{malcolm is next to him.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{there must be a game trail, some kind of path that goes down there.}
<A>__{roland looks around at the exhausted marchers.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{they'll have to rest before we look for it. eat. sleep. two hours. then we hit it.}
