<B>__{establishing shot of disciples working on the unbendable arm.}
<A>__{drew is in the middle, and gao is straining to bend his relaxed arm. he is getting the hang of it. the d.s. walks up with another monk with a spear. together, they position a wooden target. the monk bows to d.s. and to the rest of the disciples, then positions the point of the spear in the hollow of his neck. he then hands the shaft of the spear to the d.s. the d.s. holds the shaft and starts to push, bending the spear, slowly but surely.}

<A>__{amazed.}
<B>__{angle on the monk}
<A>__{the spear is now almost bent double. with a flick of his head, the spear goes flying into the target positioned behind him, its point finding the bulls eye. drew walks over to the target and sees that the very real spear point is imbedded deep into the wood of the target.}
