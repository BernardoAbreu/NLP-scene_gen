<L>__{exterior lucky star motel day}
<A>__{bernie and natalie returning from breakfast in bernie's buick. bernie can't find a parking spot. natalie climbs out, heads for the room. natalie arrives at the room. she's about to stab the key in the lock, when she realizes the door is ajar. she hesitates for a moment, then pushes it open...}
<L>__{interior bernie's motel room day}
<A>__{...to find mikey and charlene waiting on them. charlene is puffing away on a marlboro when natalie enters. she immediately stubs it out. rises, heads for the bathroom.}
<C>__{charlene}
<D>__{i gotta go pee. i'm always peeing.}
<A>__{she closes the door after her.}
<C>__{natalie}
<P>__{(to mikey)}
<D>__{how did you get in here?}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{i told the desk clerk bernie was my old man. he let us wait inside. that a problem?}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{bernie's looking for a parking space.}
<C>__{mikey}
<P>__{(chuckles)}
<D>__{shit. i musta taken the last one.}
<A>__{mikey steps up to natalie. she hasn't moved from the doorway. her dislike for mikey is evident.}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{tell me something, natalie? is he paying you?}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{my old man, is he renting your ass? 'cause otherwise i just don't get it. a loser like my pops in the company of some primo t & a. it don't compute.}
<A>__{natalie doesn't dignify mikey with an answer. she stares him down unflinchingly. mikey reaches out to natalie's ear, "pulls" out a $20 dollar chip.}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{this enough to get me a taste? family discount?}
<A>__{he drops the chip down natalie's cleavage. natalie still doesn't react. mikey reaches up, starts caressing her face. she flinches. right then, the door swings open. bernie enters. mikey snaps his fingers and a rose appears in his hand. he extends it to natalie. she ignores the gesture, steps aside.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{mikey...}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{hey, bernie. i told you i was gonna stop by.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{yeah... i figured you'd call ahead. we were out at breakfast.}
<A>__{charlene emerges from the bathroom. natalie heads over. she doesn't want to be around mikey. she stops in front of charlene, points to a sprinkling of white powder on the side of her nose.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{you missed some.}
<A>__{charlene immediately swats the coke off. natalie enters the bathroom. closes the door.}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{you see, the thing is, bernie, we're kinda strapped. i mean, charly here's expecting like yesterday, and we don't have the dough to make with the right nutrition for her an' all. so, i was wondering if you would care to invest a little in your grandchild's future... his well being.}
<A>__{bernie scratches his head, thinks on it for a moment or two. then heads over to the kitchenette cupboard. pulls down a coffee can. extracts a thick wad of bills. hands them over to mikey.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{there's about three grand there. that's all i got.}
<C>__{charlene}
<D>__{bless you, bernie.}
<P>__{(pats her belly)}
<D>__{you know, michael, i think we should name her bernadette. after your father.}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{you mean, bernie. trust me, it's a boy.}
<A>__{bernie seems quite moved by it all.}
<C>__{charlene}
<P>__{(to bernie)}
<D>__{wanna feel her?}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{i don't think... i don't want anything to hap...}
<C>__{charlene}
<D>__{ooh, i just felt her kick. c'mon, bernie, gimme your hand...}
<A>__{she places bernie's hand over her stomach.}
<C>__{charlene}
<D>__{feel that?}
<C>__{bernie}
<P>__{(not sure)}
<D>__{i don't know... i think so...}
<A>__{mikey takes charlene by the arm...}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{we'll catch you later, bernie. i think i'm gonna take charly over to the hospital right now. get her checked up real good.}
<A>__{charlene kisses bernie on the cheek. he blushes.}
<C>__{charlene}
<D>__{take care, pop.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{mikey...}
<A>__{mikey turns in the doorway, eyebrows raised. yeah?}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{you're not going to try anything stupid while you're in town?}
<A>__{mikey plays it dumb. huh?}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{you mess up and they'll cut you no slack. that's all i'm saying. you got a kid to think about.}
<A>__{mikey nods, backs out of the room. charlene giggles. they disappear into the parking lot. natalie emerges from the bathroom. she lights up a cigarette, just stares at him as if to say: sucker. bernie shrugs.}
