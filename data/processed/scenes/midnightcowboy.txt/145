<A>__{joe lies on his cot, watching ratso struggle to penetrate the fibrous husk of a coconut, experimenting with a variety of rusty tools in an old cigar box.}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{the two basic items necessary to sustain life are sunshine and coconut milk. that's a known fact. if i can find the goddam hole the milk squirts out.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{this is an okay setup you got here, but i'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{i been sick. hold this, will ya?}
<A>__{joe takes his time rising to hold the coconut while ratso tries to poke a hole with a bent ice pick.}
<C>__{ratso }
<D>__{in florida, they come smooth, ready to eat. down there, your only problem is, diet wise, you gotta lift an arm to wipe warm milk off your chin. tough, hey?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i think finding you's the smartest thing i ever did, for both of us. you just the crooked kinda sneaky little sidewinder i need to get me hustling in this town. hey!}
<A>__{joe jerks his hand away just in time to avoid the ice pick. the coconut bounces on the floor. ratso picks it up, holds it, while joe tries to crack it, swinging his boot like a hammer.}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{miami beach is the only place for a real hustler. florida has more rich chicks per square yard than any resort spot in the world. they lie out in their pagodas and pergolas waiting to grab the first jockstrap that passes.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what's all this sweet talk about florida? your friend o'daniel got a stable down there now?}
<A>__{joe swings violently. ratso yelps, hopping on his one good leg, sucking his thumb.}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{cowboy killers! break my finger, christ! i got news for you, baby, no chick with any class buys that big dumb cowboy crap...}
<A>__{ratso holds his thumb under the tub sink faucet.}
<C>__{ratso }
<D>__{... the cowboy bit's out, except among fags of a certain type, which take a certain, type hustler to exploit. like i could handle it being a stealing operation basically but take your average fag, very few of them want a cripple.}
<A>__{joe holds the coconut like yorick's skull, thinking hard.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{well, i am dumb, that's for sure. i don't talk right. i can't think too good. just only one thing i ever been good for's loving. women go crazy for me. fact. crazy annie. had to send her away. so i don't cash in on that, what am i? i'm shee it. may's well flush me down that hole with the dishwater.}
<A>__{joe sets the coconut on the floor, holding it with both hands while he tries to smash it with the heel of his boot.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{that's why you gonna stop crapping about florida and get your skinny butt moving to earn twenty bucks worth of management you owe me...}
