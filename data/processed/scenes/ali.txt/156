<A>__{mid fight ali looks swollen, out of breath. something's wrong! two solid ali jabs and a right hook connect. but they slow down frazier not at all. joe frazier, short and compact, like a pit bull, bobs and weaves his way inside ali's longer reach. ali's corner dundee + bundini shouting instructions. none get through. ali looks slow. older.}
<L>__{interior ring profile: ali + frazier}
<A>__{frazier, off his bobbing and weaving, launches his devastating left hook to ali's head. frazier is making the most of what he is: smaller. ali clinches. very low: frazier + ali the referee separates them. both men throw and miss...ali on the right, frazier on the left. ali throws a hard left that catches frazier but doesn't stop him. now frazier connects with a wild left hook into ali's cheekbone. the}
<B>__{unthinkable happens...}
<A>__{overhead: ali is knocked down onto his knee. ruled a slip, he stands immediately and continues. ali, backed against the rope again, blocks shots, pushes frazier into the middle of the ring...}

<D>__{hook's comin'. lean back, man! move back! work legs...!}
<A>__{but ali's legs don't work fast enough. frazier's hook crashes into ali's face. ali goes rubbery as he backs to the rope. ali comes out and backs to the rope on the other side, with cartoon rubbery legs. but the mimicry is camouflage. he really is wobbling. the crowd is going wild. we hear everything, now.}
<B>__{frazier}
<A>__{is wary. he doesn't trust ali. he walks across the ring, allowing ali to recuperate...the bell. ali walks to his corner, drained...}
<C>__{howard cosell }
<D>__{ali was out! he was out on his feet. joe almost had him. frazier must have thought ali was playing possum. 'cause ali's a clown. others have come in on ali when he's playing possum and gotten knocked out.}
<A>__{ali saved himself with guile.}
