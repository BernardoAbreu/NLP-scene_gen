<A>__{a surreal kaleidoscope of black, white and red. similar to the mirror scene above, the colors slowly come into focus, revealing the chiseled features of a familiar face. but this time we see that it is not a real face, but rather a plastic mask of the d.c. comic hero superman.}

<A>__{it glows eerily in the light of a porch lamp. a child's pupils glare through the eye holes... the camera pans from superman to the masked face of another caped crusader: batman. batman turns toward his loyal sidekick robin, who clutches a plastic, trick or treat pumpkin. next, we find the green lantern as he reaches up to ring the doorbell. the camera finally rests on the last boy: an unkempt kid wearing no costume at all. looking irritated and removed from the rest of the group, the kid shoves his hands in the pockets of his shearling coat. he spits and rolls his eyes as a lady answers the door. the brick home is as working class as it gets. the lady at the door is a 1950's housewife.}
