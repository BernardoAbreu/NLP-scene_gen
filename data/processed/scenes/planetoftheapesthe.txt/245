<L>__{292 another angle favoring zaius}
<A>__{who falls silent, as if this were the only news of import. we note at once a change in zaius' tone and attitude. he no longer treats taylor like a freak animal, but addresses him as an imaginative adversary who must be intimidated by the threat of terror.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{what about me?}
<C>__{zaius}
<P>__{(offhandedly)}
<D>__{oh, your case was preordained. in a way, you performed a service for the state ...}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{because your hearing made it possible for us to expose zira and cornelius.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{and now the tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. do you know what that means?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{zaius}
<D>__{emasculation, to begin with. then experimental surgery. on the speech centers. on the brain. ultimately, a kind of living death.}
<A>__{taylor stiffens but says nothing. zaius lets this prospect sink in, then continues.}
<C>__{zaius}
<D>__{however, it's within my power to grant you a reprieve. that is why i summoned you here tonight.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{i told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.}
<C>__{zaius}
<D>__{you lied. where is your tribe?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{my tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.}
<C>__{zaius}
<D>__{then how is it we speak the same language?}
<P>__{(suddenly intense)}
<D>__{even in your lies, some truth slips through! that mythical community you're supposed to come from fort wayne'?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{what about it?}
<C>__{zaius}
<D>__{a fort! unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.}
<P>__{(more calmly)}
<D>__{where were you nurtured?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{i take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge that i'm a monster created by dr. zira.}
<C>__{zaius}
<D>__{certainly not. you're a mutant.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{that's exactly what zira and cornelius claim. you're talking heresy, doctor.}
<C>__{zaius}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{taylor}
<P>__{(growing bolder)}
<D>__{all right, suppose i am a mutant? why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?}
<C>__{zaius}
<D>__{because you're not unique. there was the one you call landon }
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{then you admit }
<C>__{zaius}
<D>__{i admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. and another. a nest of them. where's your nest, taylor? where are your women?}
<C>__{taylor}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{thank you for calling me taylor.}
<P>__{(more firmly)}
<D>__{dr. zaius, i know who i am. who are you? how did this upside down civilization ever get started?}
<C>__{zaius}
<P>__{(strangely calm)}
<D>__{you may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. and deservedly.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{the eastern desert has never been explored because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{save yourself, taylor. tell me is there another jungle beyond the forbidden zone?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{zaius}
<D>__{if you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{i'm not protecting anybody! that hearing was a farce. what have i done?}
<C>__{zaius}
<D>__{you're a menace! a walking pestilence. i do know who you are, taylor. as i know that others of your kind must live in the forbidden zone.}
<P>__{(decisively)}
<D>__{you have just six hours to make a full confession. after that i will employ surgery to obtain one.}
<P>__{(calling off)}
<D>__{guards!}
<A>__{the two burly security agents open the door and enter.}
<C>__{zaius}
<D>__{take this creature back to his cage.}
<A>__{the guards seize taylor, start to shove him toward the doorway. he twists around, faces zaius.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{all right, you can cut me to pieces. it's within your power.}
<P>__{(with force)}
<D>__{but know this, doctor. you do it because you're afraid of me. you do it from fear!}
<A>__{zaius jerks his head silently toward the door. the apes drag taylor through it.}
