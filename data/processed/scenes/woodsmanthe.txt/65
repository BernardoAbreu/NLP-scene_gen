<L>__{exterior reservoir day}
<A>__{walter and vicki get out of the car which is parked on the edge of a reservoir surrounded by a thick pine forest. vicki works her way down to the water's edge. a great blue heron skims across the water's surface. walter watches her for a moment then follows. he sits down near her. vicki lights a cigarette and stares out over the water. after a long pause.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{what was prison like?}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you don't really }
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{yes! i want to know.}
<A>__{walter is quiet for a moment.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{prison is... time.}
<A>__{vicki looks at him.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{you mean the time you're locked away?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{no. prison is time. that's it. you think time, you feel time, you hear time. your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{i'm sorry, walter.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{don't be sorry for me. i did those things. no one else did. i'm dealing with that.}
<A>__{vicki looks out at the water.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{my father took me fishing here when i was a kid. he could name every fish in the lake. and for every fish he named, he had a fishing story. i hated fishing, but i loved his stories.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{sounds like a special guy.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{my father was an alcoholic who drank himself right into the grave.}
<A>__{walter looks at her.}
<C>__{vicki }
<D>__{he said he couldn't help it. said he hated himself for doing it. but, boy, did that man love to drink.}
<A>__{there is a long pause.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i've changed.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{why young girls, walter?}
<A>__{walter is silent.}
<C>__{vicki }
<D>__{is it their innocence? their beauty?...}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{their power. they seduce me.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{they seduce you?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i was always the one seduced.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{you really believe that?}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(long pause)}
<D>__{no. that's what i used to tell myself. v}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{and what do you tell yourself now?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{nothing. it's over.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{bullshit.}
<A>__{walter looks at vicki for a moment then stands up.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{okay. then take me home.}
<A>__{vicki doesn't move.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{what do you want from me?}
<A>__{vicki stands.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{i want you to change my mind!}
<A>__{walter is silent. vicki shoves walter hard.}
<C>__{vicki }
<D>__{try, goddamnit!}
<A>__{walter stumbles back a few steps but regains himself. he stares at vicki. his anger wells and he snaps.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i had this plan once... or maybe it was a dream. i was going to quit the building business... open my own shop. make and design fine country furniture. i had saved enough money. i found the perfect place. cheap five year lease. the loan was in the bag. my wife was a hundred percent behind it. everything was set... then i got in trouble.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{do you know what the worst kind of trouble is?}
<A>__{vicki watches walter, silent.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{it's trouble you bring on yourself... and the people you love the most. i lost a wife and a daughter. it hurt to lose my wife. it killed me to lose my daughter.}
<A>__{walter stops, looks at vicki. vicki stares back at him. after a long pause, she approaches and tentatively pulls him into an embrace.}
