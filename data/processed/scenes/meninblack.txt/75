<A>__{rosenberg, the jewelry store owner, steps out of a cab in the meat packing district, still carrying the ornate box and his beloved cat. he heads into leshko's, a russian diner. a moment later, the orkin van pulls to a stop across the street.}
<L>__{interior leshko's diner day}
<A>__{rosenberg comes into the tiny restaurant, squinting in the relative darkness. at a table in the middle, he sees a man eating alone an enormous, dignified, yet profoundly strange looking man in his mid fifties. rosenberg walks carefully over to the table, but does not sit down. the man (an arquillian, and if we're eagle eyed, we recognize him as the alien on a "diplomatic mission" from passport control) rises from his chair. he steps forward, to face rosenberg, who sets the ornate box on the table. immediately, rosenberg's cat jumps on top of it. rosenberg and the arquillian stare at each other for a long moment and then embrace each other. the embrace has an odd, formal quality to it, like mafiosi coming to a sitdown. they hold on, long and hard, and both seemed choked with emotion. finally, they break apart and take their seats. they speak in a bizarre alien tongue, which is subtitled. rosenberg wipes away tears.}
