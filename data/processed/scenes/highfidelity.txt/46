<L>__{interior rob's apartment night}
<A>__{darkness. we move silently through the rooms, and enter the bedroom... closer to the bed, we see rob on his back, sheets held clenched up to his chin. he stares at the ceiling, sadly.}
<B>__{jump cut}
<A>__{to almost the same shot, but it's rob and laura in the bed, semi tangled. laura has a book in her lap. a creaking is heard. laura's eyes go to the ceiling, and rob sits up at attention. they look up at the light fixture, which shakes a little faster, with the rhythm of the creaking. someone is definitely having sex upstairs, and they are going for it.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{jeez. he goes on long enough.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i should be so lucky.}
<A>__{they turn to each other and laugh.}
