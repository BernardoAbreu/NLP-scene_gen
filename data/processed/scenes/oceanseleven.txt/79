<L>__{exterior billy tim's van and truck dealership office day}
<A>__{outside a window: turk and virgil jump up and down on opposite bumpers of a van, testing its durability. inside, frank negotiates with billy tim, a cal worthingtonesque redneck car dealer, who half pays attention to him, half frets over the malloys outside.}
<C>__{billy tim}
<D>__{i'm sorry: eighteen five each is the best offer i can make you.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(playing a bit of a dandy)}
<D>__{oh, i understand perfectly. they are beautiful vans. well, i thank you for your time, mister...?}
<C>__{billy tim}
<D>__{denham. billy tim denham.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yes, denham, like a jean.}
<P>__{(they shake)}
<D>__{you know: you have lovely hands do you moisturize?}
<C>__{billy tim}
<D>__{i'm sorry?}
<A>__{frank's not letting go of the man's hand, the object now is to force billy tim into lowering his price just to get frank out of his office.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i swear by it. i try all sorts of lotions. i went through a fragrance free period last year, but now i'm liking this new brand fortified with rose hip. my sister, you know, she uses the aloe vera with the sun screen built in...}
<C>__{billy tim}
<P>__{(just can't get his hand back)}
<D>__{uh huh. you said you'd be willing to pay in cash?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i did. you know: they say cinnamon is wonderful for your pores. read that on the internet. and that ideally you should be wearing gloves to bed, but i find that would interfere with my social agenda. problem is: i get a reaction to camphor so i can't use traditional remedies...}
<C>__{billy tim}
<D>__{if you could pay cash, i could probably drop the price a little. to, say, seventeen...}
<P>__{(as frank squeezes a little)}
<D>__{... sixteen each.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(big smile)}
<D>__{that would be lovely.}
