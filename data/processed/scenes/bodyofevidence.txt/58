<D>__{i need to speak with you.}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{i don't think we have anything more to talk about, mr. dulaney.}
<A>__{she starts to get in the car.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{you were sleeping with marsh.}
<A>__{she stops appears shocked that he knows this. there is now a different quality to her an edge.}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{who told you that?}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{he video taped you.}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{that bastard!}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{i thought he was a kind, gentle man?}
<A>__{joanne doesn't appreciate dulaney throwing her words back in her face.}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{yes, i slept with him but that was a long time ago.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{you're lying. marsh was wearing a cast on the tape. it was right before he went to chicago and met miss lawson. he dumped you for her, didn't he?}
<A>__{joanne can't hold back the emotion that is building.}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{it must have been horrible. having to go there seeing them together knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{i was jealous. of course i was hurt. he switched me off like a little toy he was finished playing with. but i didn't kill him.}
<A>__{dulaney studies her.}
<C>__{joanne}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i'm a practical woman mr. dulaney. killing andrew wasn't in my best interest. as it is i'm out of a job and i'm not in his will.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{money isn't the only reason people commit murder, miss braslow.}
<A>__{dulaney walks off. joanne stares after him. her face is cold, showing no sign of emotion.}
