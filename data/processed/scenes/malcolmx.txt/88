<L>__{interior temple #7 night}
<A>__{the same woman, now at a muslim meeting. the faces of other listeners (from the church and from the maids' market) are scattered in malcolm's audience. the headquarters itself shows the progress malcolm has made. it is better furnished, larger, and the chairs are filled. bembry, sidney, and lorraine are in the back of the room, pleased with the growth. malcolm stands at a podium.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{we're not american, we're africans who happen to be in america. we were kidnapped and brought here against our will from africa. we didn't land on plymouth rock, brothers and sister. plymouth rock landed on us.}
<A>__{reactions: laughter, interest. ad lib "that's the truth."}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{put an end to your begging. no more "please, mr. white man, lawdy boss, brush me another crumb from off your table, kindly, sir." we are a nation, a great nation and don't need a thing from them.}
<A>__{malcolm scanning the faces of his audience as they react. he sees someone he knows and blurts out boyishly (and winningly):}
<C>__{malcolm }
<D>__{shorty!}
<A>__{the crowd turns to shorty, sitting embarrassedly in the audience.}
<C>__{malcolm }
<D>__{come on up here, man, and give us some skin. here's a man, brothers and sisters, who shot up with me, who robbed with me, and did time in the white devil's jailhouse. stand up, shorty, and be counted }
<A>__{but shorty is trying to hide from the spotlight. malcolm comes down from the platform and walks to him.}
<C>__{malcolm }
<D>__{folks, the brother is shy and needs special attention. so would you excuse us, while brothers sidney and earl take up the collection.}
<A>__{he embraces shorty as the crowd laughs appreciatively and brothers sidney and earl have a chuckle themselves.}
