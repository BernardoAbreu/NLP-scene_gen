<L>__{exterior hotel swimming pool underwater night}
<A>__{jacques and enzo dive into the pool in their tuxedos. each one carries a beach umbrella in a concrete base to help them stay at the bottom. enzo takes two goblets out of his pocket, hands them to jacques. takes a bottle of champagne out of the other pocket and opens it. the cork floats out of the bottle. above on the surface of the pool there's a splash. johana finds a mask on the side of the pool and watches them. her dress is soaked by now. enzo pours champagne. courteous and grave, they clink glasses and begin to drink. they have already been underwater longer than a minute. they can't really drink out of the glasses and enzo offers jacques the bottle. jacques studies the label like a connoisseur. he drinks, passes the bottle back to enzo.}
