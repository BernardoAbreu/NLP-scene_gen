<A>__{hooker blows a mock kiss through the phone and hangs up. he turns to leave the booth, when suddenly he sees something that stops him cold. there looking through the glass is the smirking face of detective synder. hooker is immobilized. snyder puts his hand inside his coat and slowly draws out his gun. he points it right at hooker's face and then violently smashes all the glass in the upper half of the door with the barrel. fragments of glass spray into the booth, a couple of which imbed themselves in hooker's cheek. hooker quickly whips open the door, trapping snyder's hand in the accordian and jarring loose his gun. hooker sprints out of the booth as snyder scrambles for his pistol and gives pursuit.}
