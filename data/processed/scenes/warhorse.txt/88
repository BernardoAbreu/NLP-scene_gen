<L>__{exterior no man's land. the same.}
<A>__{the geordie crouches for cover, waving his handkerchief more frantically.}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{it's a white flag, ent it? you see the white flag!? i'm just after tending to this here horse, is all!}
<A>__{the georgie marshals his courage and stands again, waving the handkerchief.}
<C>__{british captain}
<D>__{get back, you stupid git!}
<A>__{there's no fire from the german trenches. muttering to himself, the geordie marches forward towards joey:}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{the lord is my shepherd, i shall not want, he leadeth me into green pastures, he lay me down beside the still waters...}
<A>__{the geordie walks very slowly across the mud there are bodies the ground squelches beneath his feet. he waves his handkerchief as he walks. he crosses a narrow bridge that spans a flooded bomb crater. joey, lying on his side, wrapped head to toe in barbed wire, covered in mud, watches geordie approach. when geordie gets too close, joey freaks out and begins thrashing about. joey whinnies a high scream of pain, because wire is cutting into his hide in several places, and as he thrashes it cuts him deeper. particularly worrisome is a strand that's wrapped around his head, crossing right over his eye, threatening to slash it. the geordie calls out in a soothing voice:}
<C>__{geordie }
<D>__{poor beastie. poor babbie. it's alright. it's alright. don't buck and wriggle so, you're only shredding yourself.}
<A>__{joey calms a little, still moving his head up and down.}
<C>__{geordie }
<D>__{you'll blind yourself.}
<A>__{he reaches joey and surveys the formidable tangle of wire in which joey's bundled. the geordie soothes and at the same time gingerly tests other strands, trying to figure out where to begin.}
<C>__{geordie }
<D>__{bugger me worthless i didn't think to bring gloves or something to cut the }
<A>__{he stabs his hand on one of the barbs.}
<C>__{geordie }
<D>__{ow! damn! ow!!}
<A>__{there's a noise behind him, and the geordie turns around to see the peter (the german from the trench) standing several feet away, holding some wire cutters.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i thought perhaps you might need these.}
<A>__{he holds out the wire cutters. the geordie, still frightened, stares stupidly at them.}
<C>__{peter }
<D>__{for the barbed wire?}
<C>__{geordie}
<D>__{yeah, yeah i... ummm, thanks. cheers. cheers...}
<A>__{he reaches out and takes the proffered cutters.}
<C>__{geordie }
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{he returns to joey, nervous about turning his back. he tries to figure out where to begin cutting. he lifts a long strand of wire that wraps around joey's neck, stretches across his shoulder and torso and around one of his front legs. he puts the wire in the crux of the cutters and is preparing to snip when peter steps closer to him.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{that...that's a very long strand. when you cut it, it's going to release this }
<A>__{he points to a wire wrapped around the wire the geordie's lifting. then he points to two other wires, similarly}
