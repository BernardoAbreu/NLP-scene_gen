<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior bunkhouse day}
<A>__{super wide shot as po runs away from the compound. closer as he continues running. he checks over his shoulder, turns back... shifu lands right in front of him.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{you cannot leave! a real warrior never quits!}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{watch me!}
<A>__{he tries to maneuver around shifu, but is redirected back.}
<C>__{po }
<D>__{come on! how am i supposed to beat tai lung? i can't even beat you to the stairs.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{you will beat him because you are the dragon warrior!}
<A>__{he pushes po back with the staff.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{ow! you don't believe that! you never believed that! from the first moment i got here, you've been trying to get rid of me.}
<A>__{shifu pokes him again, this time causing po to fall on his back.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{yes. i was. but now i ask you to trust in your master as i have come to trust in mine.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{you're not my master. and i'm not the dragon warrior.}
<A>__{po shoves the staff away and gets up.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{then why didn't you quit? you knew i was trying to get rid of you, and yet you stayed.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{yeah, i stayed. i stayed because every time you threw a brick at my head or said i smelled, it hurt. but it could never hurt more than it did every day of my life just being me.}
<A>__{po looks down at the valley, then turns back to shifu.}
<C>__{po }
<D>__{i stayed because i thought if anyone could change me, could make me... not me, it was you. the greatest kung fu teacher in all of china.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{but i can change you! i can turn you into the dragon warrior! and i will!}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{c'mon, tai lung is on his way here right now. and even if it takes him a hundred years to get here, how are you gonna change this...}
<P>__{(indicate belly)}
<D>__{...into the dragon warrior? how? how? how?!}
<A>__{in frustration, shifu yells out the answer.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{i don't know!!!}
<P>__{(then, resigned)}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{that's what i thought.}
<A>__{shifu walks away, leaving the path open to po.}
