<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<C>__{jani's voice}
<D>__{jack...? i need your help...}
<A>__{jack wakes drowsily.}
<C>__{jani}
<D>__{i'm in trouble.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what kind of trouble?}
<C>__{jani}
<D>__{i owe a lot of money.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{was that why you did the two grand? i couldn't help you.}
<C>__{jani}
<D>__{i know that. but you can now.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i don't have any money. switches on the light. jani is looking distressed.}
<C>__{jani}
<D>__{some people i know, they're planning to rob the golden lion.}
<A>__{jack sits up, turns on the lamp.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you don't mean that.}
<A>__{jani pulls up the bedcover around her body.}
<C>__{jani}
<D>__{they mean it.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{who's they?}
<C>__{jani}
<D>__{my creditors. one night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino }
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{forget it, jani. it'll never work.}
<C>__{jani}
<D>__{the point is, they want a man inside.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{and i thought you were a bright woman.}
<C>__{jani}
<D>__{just listen. you don't have to do anything criminal.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{robbery's not criminal?}
<A>__{jack gets out of bed, tours the room.}
<C>__{jani}
<D>__{you don't have to be criminal. a man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. you'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. there'll be chaos. and that's when it'll happen.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you're serious.}
<C>__{jani}
<D>__{you won't be committing a crime. the man will cheat, you'll just be doing your job, that's all.}
<A>__{jack comes right up close to jani in bed.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{and i thought you were only after my body.}
<C>__{jani}
<D>__{i've come to know you. you're honest.}
<P>__{(takes his hand)}
<D>__{i trust you.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what'll you do when it all goes wrong?}
<C>__{jani}
<D>__{it won't.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{but if it does.}
<C>__{jani}
<D>__{you keep the ten thousand pounds.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what ten thousand pounds?}
<A>__{jani gets out of bed.}
<C>__{jani}
<D>__{these people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after. they want someone they can be sure of, an honest dealer. that's the pointerior not all dealers are honest. mr reynolds will never suspect you.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{reynolds? you've done your research.}
<A>__{she puts her hand on his.}
<C>__{jani}
<D>__{i didn't know what else to do. you're my last chance.}
<A>__{she takes his hand and puts it on her bruised eye.}
<C>__{jani}
<D>__{next time it'll be my neck.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what about my neck?}
<A>__{jani is close to breaking down. her toughness evaporates.}
<C>__{jani}
<D>__{i want to go back to cape town, i want to start again, clean.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i can't do it, jani.}
<C>__{jani}
<D>__{i'm asking you, as a...friend. you'd be saving the life of a friend.}
<A>__{jani goes back to bed. she turns out the light. jack stands in the middle of the dark room.}
