<L>__{ext farm morning}
<A>__{chris rumbles his jeep onto a picturesque farm, secluded deep in the forest. we don't recognize it immediately. it was dark when we last saw the place. jumping out, chris sees three large shapes lying in the grass of a corral. rushing over, chris realizes... ...they're horses. one of them is lucky, his prize stallion... dead, in a pool of blood, with its belly torn open and a huge chunk out of its neck.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{aw, no... (devastated) ...l lucky.}
<A>__{chris hears a weak, moaning sound. he turns and sees... rake, lying near a water pump. chris rushes to the man's side and finds him brutally slashed, barely clinging to life.}
<C>__{rake}
<P>__{(coughing blood) they... they come}
<D>__{outta the trees, reddy. don't... don't know what they was. figure... maybe some kinda... wolves, or somethin' ...}
<A>__{examining the man's wounds, chris realizes they're fatal.}
<C>__{rake}

<A>__{there's a thunder in the sky. chris looks up. wesker's fleet of black hueys appears on the horizon. they split up, seven banking off toward raccoon city, the remaining three grinding ahead over the forest, slowing down, dropping in altitude.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{where are they going? there's nothing in there... except...}
<C>__{rake}
<D>__{y'oughta... remember it... real good. i do. from... when you was a kid.}

<D>__{the... the old arkley place?}
<C>__{rake}
<D>__{i remember them days. i surely do... remember them... them old days.}
<A>__{chris looks back down at the old man, who is drifting, starting to lose it.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{i'm not gonna bullshit you, rake. you're...in a bad time. if there's any way to save you, i will find it, i swear. you just... hang in there, old guy. i will be right back.}
