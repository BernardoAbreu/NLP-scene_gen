<L>__{exterior hotel day}
<A>__{kenny heads down the steps with new york times washington bureau chief, scotty reston. anonymous, they weave their way through the crowd for a police car on a side street.}
<C>__{reston}
<D>__{how's my favorite president?}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{busy. but you've got his heart.}
<C>__{reston}
<D>__{i want an hour with him.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{i said his heart, not his attention.}
<C>__{reston}
<D>__{three weeks before midterm elections? you need me.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{well. there is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.}
<C>__{reston}
<D>__{i'm doing a piece on skybolt. i hear macmillan's meeting with him in nassau.}
<A>__{kenny just sighs as they make their way up to the police car. a secret service agent opens the door for him, another is behind the wheel.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{we're giving the brits polaris instead. but a story'll just aggravate things.}
<A>__{scotty stares at kenny, determined. kenny looks away. and his eye catches a tall, willowy beautiful woman. she is talking, excited, embarrassed, to two more secret service agents. what they're saying is lost in the noise. scotty follows kenny's gaze. then the two men share a look, a silent understanding. kenny glances at the secret service guy holding the car door, tilts his head at the woman.}
<C>__{kenny }
<D>__{not today. he's got tight schedule.}
<A>__{the agent nods, heads for the other agents and the beautiful woman. scotty acts like nothing has happened.}
<C>__{reston}
<D>__{pretending there isn't a problem won't fix it. he can clear the air on anglo american relations.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{forget it, scotty.}
<C>__{reston}
<D>__{let him talk to me, he makes macmillan look good, i print it, the british public likes it, macmillan owes you.}
<A>__{the formula's exactly what kenny wants to hear. he pretends to consider, pretends to cave as he gets in the car.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{all right, you're in. half hour.}
<A>__{reston's won. but so has kenny, and he's made scotty feel tough in the bargain. people like kenny.}
