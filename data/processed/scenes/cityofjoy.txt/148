<L>__{exterior clinic courtyard day}
<A>__{hasari is locking his rickshaw into the shed. staff and several patients come out of the examining rooms joan, aloka, sunil, anouar, poomina. margareta and her students, a new teacher, bandona, her students come out of the classrooms... they're all swept up in dancing, joan's metal cross jumping about as if it were beating out time. from his balcony, max emerges with his trumpet and plays the first bars of "singin' in the rain." everyone looks his way; he begins to hum and sing as he jumps over the balcony to the ground and takes off in a wild, impro vished, but damn good version of gene kelly's dance in the rain, bringing anouar on his cart in as his dancing partner. everyone in the courtyard crowds around them, laughing and encouraging the dancer singers on. the number builds to an extraordinary climax with max sliding through mud to an exquisite finish at joan's feet. there's thunderous applause.}
