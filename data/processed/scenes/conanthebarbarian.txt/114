<A>__{khalar's horse stands near the entrance. conan puts tamara's body carefully atop the horse, then mounts it himself. he positions her in front of him, his arms encircling her. conan gives her lifeless body one last kiss, her blood staining his lips red, as his mother's did as a child.}
<L>__{exterior high plateau dawn}
<A>__{a blazing sun threatens to explode over the nearby mountains. conan holds a single torch in his hand. his look is hard. grim. we pull back to reveal a funeral pyre, tamara's body atop it. conan places the torch to the pyre. it quickly spreads. we move in, closer and closer upon conan's ice blue eyes, a blazing fire erupting in them. a fire that will never be extinguished.}
