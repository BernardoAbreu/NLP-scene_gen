<C>__{odell}
<D>__{what you talkin' 'bout, 'favors'?}

<C>__{odell}

<P>__{(to odell)}
<D>__{bastard cut down two of my trees.}
<A>__{easy picks up a rock and sails it. odell comes off the porch and does the same. then a neighbor from across the street joins in. the woodcutter ambles off toward another block, leaving easy, odell and the neighbor gathered in the middle of the street.}
<B>__{up the block}
<A>__{a man with a pony is setting up a camera. a few children have gathered, and more are running over from other parts of the neighborhood. the man props up a hand painted sign, "cowboy pictures 15 cents," and lifts the first customer onto the pony positioning a cowboy hat on the child's head.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{another neighbor joins easy and company, and they continue to laugh and talk, looking up from time to time to wave at friends in passing cars.}
<C>__{easy }
<D>__{i thought about what odell had said about friends and it made sense to me... easy (v.o.) (cont'd) odell goes to church every sunday, so he would know... later on, he challenged me to a game of dominoes. and what'd he do that for? we got to talkin' 'bout texas and fooled around and drunk almost a quart of whiskey... and i forgot about daphne monet, dewitt albright and carter and them... and sat with my friend, on my porch at my house... and we laughed a long time...}
