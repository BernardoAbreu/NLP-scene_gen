<A>__{jill is tossing in her sleep. john is fast asleep next to her, on his side facing away from her. then, jill wakes up. she is heavily sedated, groggy. she hardly knows where she is at first. she pulls herself up to a sitting position on the side of the bed. she tries to gather her wits. then she gets up and walks slowly out of the room.}

<A>__{through the upstairs hallway, down the staircase and toward the kitchen. the darkness around her is ominous, threatening. she stops at the dining room window and looks out. on the street a patrol car slowly passes and disappears down the block.}
