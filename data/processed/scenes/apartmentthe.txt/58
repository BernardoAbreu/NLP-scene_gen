<L>__{interior nineteenth floor day}
<A>__{it's a swinging party, all right. nobody is working. several desks have been cleared and pushed together, and on top of this improvised stage four female employees and mr. dobisch, with his pants legs rolled up, are doing a rockette kick routine to the tune of jingle bells. employees are ringed around the performers, some drinking out of paper cups, others singing and clapping in rhythm. one of the cubicles has been transformed into a bar, and it is jammed with people. mr. kirkeby and mr. vanderhof are pouring each has a couple of bottles of liquor in his hands, and is emptying them into the open top of a water cooler. but the stuff is flowing out as fast as it flows in everybody is in line with a paper cup waiting for a refill. bud comes shouldering his way out of the crowded cubicle, holding aloft two paper cups filled with booze. since his promotion he has bought himself a new suit, dark flannel, and with it he wears a white shirt with a pinned round collar, and a foulard tie. he also has quite a glow on. detouring past necking couples, he heads in the direction of the elevators. the doors of fran's elevator are just opening, and the switchboard operators, led by sylvia, come streaming out.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<P>__{(to a colleague)}
<D>__{ so i said to him: never again! either get yourself a bigger car or a smaller girl }
<A>__{as they head for the party, they pass bud, who is approaching the elevator with the two drinks. fran is just closing the elevator doors.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{miss kubelik.}
<A>__{the doors slide open again, and fran looks out. instead of the customary carnation in the lapel of her uniform, she wears a sprig of holly.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(holding out one of the drinks)}
<D>__{marry christmas.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{thank you.}
<P>__{(takes drink)}
<D>__{i thought you were avoiding me.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{what gave you that idea?}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{in the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once and then you didn't take your hat off.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{well, as a matter of fact, i was rather hurt when you stood me up that night }
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{i don't blame you. it was unforgivable.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i forgive you.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{you shouldn't.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{you couldn't help yourself. i mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. you did the only decent thing.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{don't be too sure. just because i wear a uniform that doesn't make me a girl scout.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{miss kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character and as far as i'm concerned, you're tops. i mean, decency wise and otherwise wise.}
<P>__{(toasting)}
<D>__{cheers.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{cheers.}
<A>__{they down their drinks. bud takes the empty cup from her.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{one more?}
<C>__{fran}
<P>__{(indicating elevator)}
<D>__{i shouldn't drink when i'm driving.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{you're so right.}
<A>__{he reaches into the elevator, takes a cardboard sign off a hook, hangs it on the elevator door. it reads use other}
<B>__{elevator.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{by the power vested in me, i herewith declare this elevator out of order.}
<P>__{(leading her toward the party)}
<D>__{shall we join the natives?}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{why not?}
<P>__{(as they pass a kissing couple)}
<D>__{they seem friendly enough.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{don't you believe it. later on there will be human sacrifices white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{how many of those drinks did you have?}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(holding up four fingers)}
<D>__{three.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{i thought so.}
<A>__{they have now reached the entrance to the bar, which is overflowing with thirsty natives.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{you wait here. i think i hear the sound of running water.}
<A>__{he leaves her outside the cubicle, and elbows his way through the crowd toward the booze filled water cooler. out of another cubicle comes miss olsen, cup in hand. she too has had quite a few. seeing fran, she walks up to her, with an acid smile on her face.}
<C>__{miss olsen}
<D>__{hi. how's the branch manager from kansas city?}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{i beg your pardon?}
<C>__{miss olsen}
<D>__{i'm miss olsen mr. sheldrake's secretary.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{yes, i know.}
<C>__{miss olsen}
<D>__{so you don't have to play innocent with me. he used to tell his wife that i was the branch manager from seattle four years ago when we were having a little ring a ding ding.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{i don't know what you're talking about.}
<C>__{miss olsen}
<D>__{and before me there was miss rossi in auditing and after me there was miss koch in disability and just before you there was miss what's her name, on the twenty fifth floor }
<C>__{fran}
<P>__{(wanting to get away)}
<D>__{will you excuse me?}
<C>__{miss olsen}
<P>__{(holding her by the arm)}
<D>__{what for? you haven't done anything it's him what a salesman always the last booth in the chinese restaurant and the same pitch about divorcing his wife and in the end you wind up with egg foo yong on your face.}
<A>__{bud comes burrowing out of the crowded cubicle, balancing the two filled paper cups, spots fran.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{miss kubelik.}
<A>__{fran turns away from miss olsen.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{well thank you.}
<C>__{miss olsen}

<D>__{you all right? what's the matter?}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{nothing.}
<P>__{(takes the drink)}
<D>__{there are just too many people here.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{why don't we step into any office? there's something i want your advice about, anyway.}

<D>__{i have my own office now, naturally. and you may be interested to know i'm the second youngest executive in the company the only one younger is a grandson of the chairman of the board.}
