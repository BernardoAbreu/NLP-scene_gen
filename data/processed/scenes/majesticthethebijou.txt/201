<L>__{exterior lawson passenger depot late afternoon}
<A>__{the train is just pulling in to lawson. as it shudders to a halt, the door of the passenger compartment opens and pete steps out looks and his jaw drops open...}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{the entire town has turned out. they're all there, smiling broadly. a large, hand lettered banner reads:}
<D>__{welcome home pete!}
<C>__{lawson's favorite son}
<A>__{a cheer goes up from the crowd, breaking the silence. pete descends from the train and moves into the throng. the first two people he encounters are bob leffert and mabel lanier. bob sticks out his good hand and pete takes it, both smiling as they shake hands vigorously.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{luke... um, i mean, pete, if it weren't for you, i wouldn't have had the nerve to ask this fine woman to marry me.}
<A>__{mabel's mouth drops open.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{bob, congratulations! when'd you ask her?}
<C>__{mabel}
<D>__{holy moley! just now!}
<P>__{(to bob)}
<D>__{yes, bob! yes!}
<A>__{as mabel kisses bob for all she's worth, pete continues into the crowd, where he's kissed, embraced, patted on the back.}
<B>__{adele}
<A>__{is at the back of the crowd, working her way to the front. she rushes into pete's arms, and they kiss. another cheer goes up.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i see you got the telegram.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{pete, i'm so sorry about what they did to you. i didn't think you'd come back, i thought you'd want to write again...}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{dell, i can't write unless i'm happy, and i can't be happy unless i'm here and with you.}
<P>__{(grabs her shoulders)}
<D>__{this is me, delly. pete appleton. and i love you!}
<C>__{adele}
<P>__{(tears in her eyes)}
<D>__{and (hic!) i love you, pete!}
<A>__{they kiss again. pete pulls away and looks at his watch.}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{c'mon, dell, we gotta go. showtime in fifteen minutes.}
<A>__{the train whistle blows as it slowly pulls out of the station.}
<C>__{pete's narration }
<D>__{"happily ever after" is a relative term, folks. my world is much smaller now, and my dreams are very different than they were. but i have something now that i never had before: i have the magic. and it's for sale at the bijou, every day of the year. all you need is the price of a ticket.}
<A>__{we boom up to see pete and adele moving into and being enveloped by the crowd. spencer wyatt's band is assembled in front of the depot office, and they kick into some up tempo boogie woogie as we move up and away still in the same shot moving over the town, settling down again to grab a shot of the bijou's marquee. the neon chaser lights pop on, illuminating the sign, which reads:}
