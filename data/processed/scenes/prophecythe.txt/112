<L>__{exterior gabriel's rambler day}
<A>__{radio turned up, sophomoric grin glued on his face, gabriel roars past and begins the snaking climb up the side of the butte. the sun has almost completely slipped away now, leaving the land a deathly bluish grey. the road flattens out at the top of the butte and gabriel can see the village glowing at the far end. he punches the rambler, winding it up for the last stretch, and pats the blonde on the knee.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{you'll like this, rachael.}
<A>__{maybe not. there's a sudden glint of metal in the headlights as thomas at the last moment pulls up the heavy chain and hooks it over the far post. gabriel does something pointless with the brakes and slams forward into it. the whole rear of the car stands up on impact, pitching gabriel through the windshield into the dust. thomas steps out from behind the post armed with an iron bar. the rambler hisses and belches a death rattle as he cautiously walks toward the spot of gloom where gabriel lies.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<P>__{(breathless)}
<D>__{nice move.}
<A>__{thomas's feet crunch softly closer.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{you ought to come work for us. upstairs. we sneak the odd civilian in now and then, you know. you'd like it. nobody tells you when to go to bed, can eat all the ice cream you want. and you get to kill. all day and all night. just like an angel.}
<A>__{thomas doesn't answer. gabriel's body looks ravaged as he carefully steps closer and closer.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{save yourself, friend. why go to the wall with the bitch and her rug rat? it'll all turn out the same anyway. here or in heaven, we're still gonna tear the kid apart.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{i'm not an angel, heaven or hell. i'm a man you eyeless puke, which means i have one thing you never will. a soul. and though i may, somewhere inside, believe in a god, i will never, never, believe in you.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{a little speechy today, aren't we?}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{okay pal, have it your way.}
<A>__{gabriel's legs suddenly swing around and smack thomas, sprawling him back into the dirt. the iron bar goes flying as gabriel in a flash is on top of him. thomas thrashes but gabriel easily pins his shoulders and sits on his chest. without hurry he uncurls the fingers of his right hand.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{this is going to really, really hurt.}
<A>__{thomas's eyes are wild with fear.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{...you your war...}
<A>__{gabriel's spread fingers lower themselves toward his face.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{c'mon, son, out with it. make this one count.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{your war's a lie!}
<C>__{gabriel}
<P>__{(pauses)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{running around acting like this is really about whether christ is just the son of god or if he is god. bullshit! that's not what this is about at all, is it?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{you're wrong.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{then prove it to me, gabriel. i studied three fucking years of theology before i picked up a gun. c'mon, you're chief goddamn angel, i'm just a little man. prove to me christ is just a son and less than god. prove it!}
<A>__{gabriel hesitates.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i don't have to.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{because you can't! because this war isn't about some obscure medieval hangup. you're just jealous.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{you're wrong!}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{try me, gabriel. go on. prove to me the temporal nature of the trinity. show me through logic how the son of the word can be separated from the father. fight me with philosophy, gabriel!}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{because you and your army are wrong! and you know it. you knew it sixteen centuries ago.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{we don't have to listen to him! he's just a son!}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{that's it. you're jealous. jealous he could love something more than you...}
<C>__{gabriel}
<P>__{(hisses)}
<D>__{shut up...}
<A>__{gabriel's becoming unglued.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{if you wanted to know so badly, gabriel, why didn't you just ask him? why didn't you just ask god?}
<A>__{a shudder passes through gabriel. he straightens up and looks down at thomas as emotion racks his body.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{because he doesn't talk to us anymore!}
<A>__{the two stare at one another. then gabriel, lost in himself, suddenly turns away from thomas and walks into the darkness. for the village. thomas climbs quickly to his feet, spins around and is hit full force by a rabid, shrieking rachael. her legs lock around his body vise like as her teeth and nails dig into his skin. he cries out and stumbles to the ground. the two grapple furiously in the dust, rachel's crazed face taking bite after bite out of his shoulder and neck. thomas manages a fistfull of her hair and yanks the fangs off his shoulder. with his other arm he cuffs her hard, breaking the grip and rolling her aside. he staggers to his knees and begins to run. shrieking, a mad porcelain banshee out of the dusk, rachael catches up and tackles him. on the way down his head strikes a small stone wall and the pain is white thunder. gagging and weeping in blank shock, he crawls on his hands and knees as rachael opens up his arm from shoulder to elbow with her nails. as the blood tumbles like ribbons, rachael jumps onto his back, digging her claws into his scalp. it's about all one human can take. mad with pain and anger and desperation, thomas manages to climb to a shaky crouch, rachael still shrieking on his back. throwing all his weight backward, he jams her into the short stone wall. the impact snaps her hold and propels her over the wall and two thousand feet down the side of the butte. thomas daggett can only curl up into a ball, gulping shallow, shuddering breaths.}
<B>__{in the village}
<A>__{gabriel walks resolutely up to the first hogan and kicks down the plank wood door. no one home. he walks to the second and kicks its door down. nothing.}
<B>__{in the kiva}
<A>__{mary's ceremony is nearing a crescendo. grey horse has donned the colorful mask of the yei god monster slayer as the relatives now join in the guttural chants of the enemy ghost way. through the thick, choking smoke of the ceremonial fire we see katherine, nervously watching the door.}
<B>__{in the darkness outside the village}
<A>__{thomas tries hopelessly to make his way back. stumbling every few steps, he's beyond pain and into driven numbness. it's hopeless though. we know it.}
<B>__{in the village}
<A>__{gabriel kicks down another door to another empty hogan. there's only one left. as he approaches, from within can be heard the muffled sound of chanting.}
<B>__{thomas}
<A>__{takes a few more fumbling steps and falls again. he reaches out to something metal for support. it's katherine's pickup.}
<B>__{gabriel}
<A>__{steps up to the kiva door and kicks it. the frame buckles but holds. he steps back a few feet, puts all his weight into a turn, and kicks again. the door shatters.}
<B>__{inside}
<A>__{wood splinters rocket through the smoke as gabriel appears in the doorway. grey horse, everyone, freezes.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{relax folks, it's just a soul.}
<A>__{from out of the smoke steps katherine. she fires, one round, into gabriel's side. the archangel is pitched against the kiva's wall, where he stays a moment before turning to katherine.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i'm getting real tired of you.}
<A>__{she stands her ground between him and the child.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{go to hell.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{heaven, darling. heaven. at least get the zip code right.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{it's all the same, isn't it?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{no. in heaven we believe in love.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{and what do you love, gabriel?}
<A>__{once again, the shade of doubt holds him up. but it's quickly pushed aside for a corrupted grin. he's given up all pretense.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{ cracking your skull.}
<A>__{he advances on her.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{that's all it is for you anymore, gabriel, isn't it? just the killing and the burning. you don't work for god anymore. you don't fight for love.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{shut up!}
<A>__{and he's on her. with his left arm he brutally forces her to her knees as his right hand, palm out and fingers splayed, clamp themselves over her face. katherine's mouth opens in a silent scream as the pain, immediate and beyond endurance, flows through her body. from somewhere outside, there's a sound. katherine gulps chokes of agony as her very clothes begin to smolder around her. we hear the sound once more, closer, before the entire kiva wall explodes inward as katherine's pickup crashes through it. the mangled grill and hood slam into gabriel from the side and smash him to the ground like a broken puppet. katherine falls backward to the floor, gets up, and runs to the truck's cab. inside sits a near catatonic thomas. katherine takes only a second to share a look with him before reaching back and pulling out the pickup's tire iron. gabriel, a shattered, broken thing, pulls himself up to his knees. the sunglasses are gone and two eyeless pits stare out at mary, huddled in the corner. bleeding from every pore, one arm bent back the wrong way, he crawls across the floor toward her, his voice the milky slur of a stroke victim.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{god loves you, mary!}
<A>__{katherine brings the tire iron down on his skull with all her might, driving him to the floor. she turns to grey horse, her eyes wild.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{finish it.}
<A>__{he, everyone, just stare. stunned to stone.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{finish it!}
<A>__{grey horse timidly picks up his prayer stick and with a voice faltering and cracked, in the insane glare of the wrecked pickup's headlights, resumes the enemy ghost way chant. katherine turns back to gabriel.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{go home.}
<A>__{she hits him again with the tire iron. then lifts it high once more above her head. she's going to crush him, to implode his skull. when a hand stops her. sort of a hand. a claw. lucifer's. he's standing behind her, holding the raised bar still.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{katherine releases the bar and lets it clang to the floor. lucifer turns to the villagers, gazing fearfully at him as they awkwardly try to finish the chant.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{please. go on.}
<A>__{lucifer's gaze falls on a deeply fucked up gabriel who groans at the sight of him.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{oh man, this just isn't my day.}
<A>__{lucifer kneels down beside him. katherine instinctively starts to reach for the tire iron but the sycophant hisses a liquid, chattering warning at her.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{long time.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{the world's young, man.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{and full of ambition.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{this isn't your war.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{but i remember the last one. michael's war.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{you lost.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{but lots of angels were with me. every one followed their leader out of heaven.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{yeah yeah, i was there, remember?}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{except one. oh, he was with me all right. he hated the eagle scout. envied the power he gave to his son. but this angel never came out front during the war. and when it ended he thought maybe, maybe the eagle scout didn't notice. so he laid low and towed the company line till he could start his own war. it was all just jealousy.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{you're dreaming.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{but maybe he did notice. maybe that's why i'm here.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{ stay away from me.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{you've always been a part of me, gabriel. and now it's time to come home.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{fuck you!}
<A>__{lucifer slams gabriel's head against the floor and pins it. as the angel thrashes furiously, lucifer forces his arm into gabriel's chest. gabriel cries out as lucifer pulls his arm half out and forces it deeper. again. and again. soon gabriel's screams become giggles, then a crazed, hysterical laughter. the room goes insane. an impossible nightmare of chanting navahos, glaring headlights, and gabriel's echoing laughter as lucifer pumps his chest. laughter that rises to a kind of orgasmic cry then instantly stops as lucifer pulls out the angel's heart, and eats it. at that instant grey horse places his hand on mary's forehead, speaks a last line, and the chant is completed. sticky, smoky, awful silence. gabriel is a non thing. a battered, hollow shell. bartholomew grey horse, his voice cracked and finished, turns to katherine.}
<C>__{grey horse}
<D>__{the enemy spirit is gone.}
<C>__{daggett}
<P>__{(weak, faint)}
<D>__{where?}
<A>__{from outside the kiva suddenly comes the sound of a wounded, savage growl. katherine walks to the doorway. just outside a lone coyote is twisting in the dirt with furious agony. abruptly its thrashings cease. the animal stands and flashes for an instant at katherine cold yellow eyes more than animal. then it's gone into the blackness. forever. she turns and goes back to thomas in the cab. bleeding to death is a real possibility for him. she pulls an old shirt out of the back and tries to makeshift a wrap for his sliced arm.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{more will come... to look for the soul...}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{and they won't find it. not in mary.}
<A>__{a few of the village elders appear at the cab.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{can you help him?}
<C>__{villager}
<D>__{we have some bandages.}
<A>__{katherine walks over to where mary, sweaty and shaken, sits huddled in a corner attended by grey horse.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{are you all right, pumpkin?}
<A>__{mary's voice shakes as tears roll out her eyes.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i'm okay.}
<A>__{katherine gathers her up into her arms and holds her.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{it's going to be okay... we're all going to be okay...}
<A>__{the chattering, hissing sycophant grabs gabriel's body by the hair and shoulders and drags it out the door. lucifer has remained behind, crouched on his haunches, his liquid, yellow eyes on katherine.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{i can't quite bring myself to say thank you.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{i understand.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{then this is done.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{not necessarily. maybe i like you. maybe i want you to come with me.}
<A>__{he rises to his feet and steps slowly toward her.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{you owe me, katherine. and you're going to ask me to take you home.}
<C>__{katherine}
<P>__{(clutching mary)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{you will. you will because any other way is going to be more awful than you can imagine.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{are you threatening me?}
<A>__{just a grinning, twisted stare.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{then you've picked the wrong person this time. i've just about had it up to here with ghosts. so you can put away the horror movie sneer and the k mart halloween eyes, because we know you now. we know you all. and if you want to force the issue then go ahead because you're just another angel to me. take a look at your buddy gabriel. then ask yourself, do you really, really want to fuck with us?}
<A>__{the smallest hint of a pause.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{perhaps another time.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{i'm holding my breath.}
<C>__{lucifer}
<D>__{goodbye, katherine. for now.}
<A>__{and he's gone. through the door and into the night.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{is he coming back?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{i don't think so, honey... i don't think so...}
