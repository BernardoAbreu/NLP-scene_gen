<L>__{exterior hedgerow field day}
<A>__{a beautiful, hedgerow lined field of tall grass. the last of the dew and morning mist is just burning off. the six americans walk carefully through the woods to the edge of the field. miller notices something. he silently signals stop, crouches and scans the field and the hedgerow on the far side. sarge and jackson ease up next to him. jackson points to some trees nearby, freshly shattered and pock marked with bullets. wade calls quietly from a tangle of roots and brush.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{captain.}
<A>__{staying low, they join wade who has found:}
<B>__{two dead american paratroopers}
<A>__{a trail of blood and flattened grass leads from the field. miller, sarge and jackson crawl to the edge of the field, scan the far hedgerow. the others crawl up behind them.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{in the shadow by those two trees.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{my guess, too.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{a machine gun.}
<A>__{miller eases back from the edge of the field into the cover of the brush. he stands and takes off his pack.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{sir, i've got an idea, let's go around.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{we can't leave it here.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{we left them eighty eights.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{they don't send planes to put out machine guns.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{two flank runners with surpressing fire. i'm going right, whoever goes left has to be fast.}
<A>__{upham steels himself and steps forward.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{sir, i ran the 220 in high school.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{he's fast, captain, i saw him.}
<A>__{miller takes upham's measure. wade laughs with a sneer.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{how fast?}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{twenty four five.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{shit, that's nothing, i ran twenty two flat.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{wade goes left.}
<A>__{wade joins miller in peeling off his extra gear. upham is impressed.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{twenty two flat?}
<A>__{wade takes a grenade from upham's chest strap.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{i would have won the states if some bastard hadn't tripped me in the finals.}
<A>__{miller points the others to their firing positions.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{sarge, upham, here. jackson, reiben, ten yards, either side.}
<A>__{as they take their positions, miller and sarge speak quietly, out of earshot of the men.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{rule of thumb, captain, says you ought to detail this one, instead of going yourself.}
<A>__{miller looks at the two dead paratroopers.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{yeah? what rule of thumb is that?}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{how about i go right, sir?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{how about you take your position?}
<A>__{sarge hesitates.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{how about...?}
<C>__{miller}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{how about you shut up and take your position?}
<A>__{sarge nods.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{sarge finds a spot. miller joins wade. miller waits near upham as the other men settle into their firing positions.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{good luck, captain.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{don't need it, i'm a cat, i've got five lives.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{the men said, nine.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{what do they know?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i had nine, but i feel through the ice when i was seven, my brother pulled me out. then i used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in sicily, it was a dud. i figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{that only leaves three.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{plenty.}
<A>__{miller sees that the men are in position. he nods to wade.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{ready?}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{miller and wade take deep breaths. miller now.}
<B>__{miller and wade take off at full runs.}
<A>__{onto opposite sides of the field. nothing happens for a moment. then:}
<B>__{a heavy german machine gun opens up. murderously loud. shattering the quiet. in the nest}
<A>__{a squad of germans, dug deep, blasting the machine gun, a big schwarzlose}
