<C>__{phillip}
<D>__{how many?}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{many as you want.}
<A>__{phillip lays out six more slices. the dashboard is now covered with bread. phillip pulls out the mustard but has no knife. butch pulls out a stick of gum and hands it to phillip to spread with. as they drive along they pass a large, happy family (mom, dad, girl 5, boy 7) picnicking in the dip of a long hill alongside the highway. from the look of their brand new loaded down station wagon they are on vacation. closeup phillip mesmerized by the family. closeup butch ditto. he pulls his eyes back to the road, notices something.}
