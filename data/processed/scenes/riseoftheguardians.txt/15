<D>__{montreal, sector six: ten premolars, eight incisors and twelve canines. steer clear of the wild goose migration.}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{sandy, thank you for coming.}
<A>__{sandy descends from the plane and floats to the ground. he joins north, bunny and tooth as they walk through the globe room. sand glyphs appear above sandy's head communicating that he is busy and has a lot of work to do.}
<C>__{north}
<P>__{(to sandy)}
<D>__{i know, i know, but i obviously wouldn't have called you all here unless it was serious.}
<A>__{north, bunny, tooth and sandy reach the center of the room. tooth does her best to shush her mini fairies.}
<C>__{north }
<D>__{the boogie man was here at the pole.}
<A>__{north points to the globe. the other guardians turn to look.}
<C>__{tooth}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{pitch? pitch black? here?!}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{yes! there was black sand covering the globe.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{what, what...what do you mean black sand?}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{and then a shadow!}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{hold on, hold on, i thought you said you saw pitch.}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{well, ah, not exactly... guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 10.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{not exactly? can you believe this guy?}
<A>__{bunny turns to sandy, who shrugs while forming a dreamsand question mark above his head.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{yeah, you said it, sandy.}
<A>__{bunny goes back to painting one of his easter eggs.}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{look, he is up to something very bad. i feel it, in my belly.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<P>__{(his eyes narrow)}
<D>__{hang on, hang on, you mean to say, you summoned me here three days before easter because of your belly? mate, if i did this to you three days before christmas }
<C>__{tooth}
<P>__{(to her fairies)}
<D>__{argentina. priority alert! a batch of bicuspids in buenos aires.}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{please. bunny. easter is not christmas.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{here we go...}
<A>__{north grabs bunny's painted egg, casually juggling it in his hand as he walks off. meanwhile sandy, who is being served eggnog by a yeti, suddenly notices something high above.}
<C>__{bunnymund }
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{north, i, i don't have time for this. i've still got two million eggs to finish up.}
<A>__{the moon rises into view, high up in the ceiling; its rays of light begin to shine brightly through as they cascade down the walls of the globe room.}
<C>__{north }
<D>__{no matter how much you paint, is still egg! guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 11.}
<A>__{sandy points to the moon unsuccessfully to get the others' attention.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{look, mate, i'm dealing with perishables. right. you've got all year to prepare.}
<C>__{tooth}
<P>__{(to her fairies)}
<D>__{pittsburg, boy eight, two molars. saltwater taffy.}
<A>__{sandy puts his fingers in his mouth to whistle, a silent musical note forming above his head.}
<C>__{north}
<P>__{(to bunny)}
<D>__{why are rabbits always so nervous.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{and why are you always such a blowhard!}
<C>__{tooth }
<P>__{(to her fairies)}
<D>__{ontario, sector nine: five canines, two molars, and fourteen incisors. is that all in one house?}
<A>__{sandy waves a sand flag above his head, pointing and jumping up and down as the moonlight continues to fill the room.}
<C>__{north}
<P>__{(turning his attention)}
<D>__{tooth! can't you see we're trying to argue.}
<C>__{tooth}
<D>__{sorry, not all of us get to work one night a year. am i right, sandy?}
<A>__{sandy tries to signal with a golden arrow, pointing toward the ceiling, but to no avail as the others continue their bickering. sandy thinks tooth has noticed for a split second, but then }
<C>__{tooth}
<P>__{(to her fairies)}
<D>__{san diego, sector two! five incisors, a bicuspid and a really loose molar on stand by. guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 12.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<P>__{(mocking)}
<D>__{come on, mate, pitch went out with the dark ages. we made sure of that remember?}
<C>__{north }
<D>__{i know it was him. we have serious situation!}
<C>__{bunnymund }
<D>__{well, i've got a serious situation with some eggs.}
<C>__{tooth }
<D>__{hey, i hate to interrupt the, "we work so hard once a year club" but could we concentrate on the matter }
<A>__{sandy can't take it anymore, grabs an elf by his hat, and vigorously shakes it's bell. the other guardians are finally silenced and all turn to look at sandy, who points up, a sand crescent moon forming above his head. the dizzy elf staggers away. finally the others turn to see the shaft of moonlight as it concentrates on the circle between them.}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{aah! man in moon! sandy, why didn't you say something?}
<A>__{sandy gives him a deadpan stare, dreamsand smoke shoots out his ears.}
<C>__{north}
<P>__{(to man in moon)}
<D>__{it's been a long time old friend! what is big news?}
<A>__{everyone looks to the center of the intense spot of moonlight, the light ebbs away, leaving a dark spot which resolves into the shadowed silhouette of pitch. the guardians look on, stunned.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{it is pitch.}
<A>__{north pats his belly and gives bunny a look.}
<C>__{north}
<P>__{(back up to the moon)}
<D>__{manny...what must we do? guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 13.}
<A>__{in answer, the shadow of pitch disappears and the circle of moonlight intensifies and shrinks, concentrating further illuminating an ornate symbol on the floor, at the center of their circle. the symbol rises out of the ground revealing a large gem at the head of a pillar.}
<C>__{tooth}
<D>__{ah, guys, you know what this means?}
<A>__{the moons light suddenly refracts through the gem casting light all over the chamber.}
<C>__{north}
<P>__{(awed)}
<D>__{he's choosing a new guardian.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{what?! why?}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{must be big deal! manny thinks we need help!}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{since when do we need help?!}
<C>__{tooth}
<D>__{i wonder who it's gonna be?}
<A>__{a dreamsand four leaf clover forms above sandy's head.}
<C>__{tooth }
<D>__{maybe the leprechaun?}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{please not the groundhog, please not the groundhog.}
<A>__{then a bright flash, a rush of wind and a figure resolves over the central pillar: slight, hooded, bearing a familiar hooked staff.}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{jack frost.}
<A>__{the mini teeth all sigh and swoon as the guardians stand there, stunned.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{ah, i take it back! the groundhog's fine! guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 14.}
<C>__{tooth}
<P>__{(caught admiring jack)}
<D>__{well, ah, as long he helps to ah...to protect the children, right?}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{jack frost!? he doesn't care about children! all he does is freeze water pipes and mess with my egg hunts. right? he's an irresponsible, selfish...}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{guardian.}
<A>__{this stops bunnymund in his tracks.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{jack frost is many things, but he is not a guardian.}
<A>__{as we turn toward the face of the hooded figure.}
