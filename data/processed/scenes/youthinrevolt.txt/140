<L>__{exterior highway 101 raining night}
<A>__{the three boys are still standing in the rain by the pay phone. the three of them huddle under their only windbreaker. a pair of headlights appear in the rain. the headlights flash twice and nick runs out into the road.}
<B>__{pov truck driver}
<A>__{nick waving frantically in nothing but tightie whities. the truck pulls to a stop and the passenger door opens to reveal, the driver, a man named wally rumpkin, a seven foot tall giant in a plaid shirt and bib overalls. he looks down at our three waylaid adventurers.}

<D>__{pardon me. but is one of you nick twisp?}
<A>__{the two other boys exchange confused glances, not entirely if this is how people go missing.}

<C>__{wally}
<D>__{i'm wally. i'm a friend of your mom's.}
<A>__{nick nods, not yet sure whether or not this gentle giant is actually blushing with shyness or red with agitation at being sent on a midnight mission.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{so, uhm, uh... your mom says you need a ride. did i mention i'm a friend?}
<A>__{nick breaks into a smile. finally the gods have cut him a break.}
