<L>__{exterior downtown day}
<A>__{the building is squat and brick. a non descrip warehouse that subs as a police evidence storage area. the sun is hard today as it beats down on jerry's large brimmed felt hat. daylight and jerry don't get along very well. his sunken, filmy eyes squint at its glare. the decayed flesh cracking along his cheeks flames at its touch. he shuffles down the sidewalk, the brackish, amber fluid that gurgles down his leg filling his shoes and leaving behind shiny wet footprints like a snail. there's nobody around the back door and its unlocked. jerry's shrunken claws pull it open.}
<B>__{inside}
<A>__{is a crush of filing cabinets and erector set shelves. all of it crammed with low grade stuff. the heroin busts and million dollar currency arrests don't end up here. here it's all shoe boxes and dusty files. fragments of small lives forgotten. jerry pulls the brim of his hat down even further as he works his way past rack after rack. the single uniform he meets looks only casually at jerry's lapel id badge. it's on the third shelf he finds it. john doe #78. jerry lifts the box and walks out.}
