<A>__{smiley threads his way through the party, walking amongst his colleagues, enjoying himself... jerry westerby and connie sachs are arm in arm, singing along to a song "the second worst spy in the world." they link smiley to them for a verse, others joining in around them. the song segues into the russian national anthem. the crowd sing lustily, many of them russian speaking, enjoying the chance to sing with vigour. smiley walks on. behind him the song ends to be replaced by the charlie rich song we heard earlier. his p.o.v. one of the larger mothers doubled up with laughter, pulling a cracker with a flushed toby esterhase, hopelessly outweighed, but competitive to the finish. roy bland with his plain wife, eyeing one of the pretty debs as she dances by. a mother takes smiley by the hand and leads him briefly into the dance. smiley takes a turn with her, and extricates himself. still smiling...}
