<A>__{schuyler does a double take as christine comes down the staircase, wearing a sweatshirt and shorts. she lights up when she sees him, then quickly hides her excitement.}

<D>__{sky? hi, sky.}
<A>__{mr. kaminsky allows the relieved schuyler to enter now.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{well, i'm gonna get back to that carburetor... nice meeting you.}
<A>__{christine's dad winks at his daughter as he moves back to the basement. she rolls her eyes, but mouths, "thanks," and then moves to sit beside schuyler in the modest, over knick knacked living room: religious pictures and statues, family photos, etc.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{i didn't think i'd what are you doing here?}
<A>__{schuyler is smiling at himself now, shaking his head. christine reaches across him to flip on a lamp.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{last night, when jack dropped you off did anything happen?}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{no... unfortunately.}
<C>__{schuyler}

<D>__{come on }
<C>__{schuyler}

<C>__{christine}
<D>__{what? who?}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{crs... i saw pictures, girl with a tattoo on her shoulder like yours }
<C>__{christine}
<P>__{(touches her shoulder)}
<D>__{ssh, my folks don't know about that yet. so, what they wanted ransom from you or something?}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{no, i thought they were trying to frame me, they planted evidence...}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{why would they do that?}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{i have no idea, nothing they do makes any sense. forget it, it's just a game.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{so that's the only reason you came out here to east hell, your stupid goddamn game.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{i was worried about you. i wanted to see you again.}
<C>__{christine}
<P>__{(thinks for a beat)}
<D>__{if you pretend to mean that, i will pretend to believe it. well, looks like your pals are trying to keep us together. buy me dinner at least?}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{sure, why not.}
<C>__{christine}
<P>__{(rises)}
<D>__{i look like a slob, let me change.}
<A>__{she hurries upstairs. schuyler sighs, wondering what the hell he's doing here. he glances at a virgin mary statue, squints then unscrews the head, it's a decanter. he takes a sniff and puts it back with a bemused expression. he takes another sniff, noticing something else in the air... a wisp of smoke rises from the lamp christine turned on. schuyler peers beneath the shade. on the table is a framed photograph of a little girl who could be christine in a frilly white dress, holding flowers. angle inside lampshade a new pricetag dangles from the shade against the bulb, starting to turn brown, smoking. schuyler licks his fingertips, reaches inside the shade to pull off tag in doing so, he burns his fingers on the hot bulb, stifles a curse and jerks his hand away. he knocks over the picture, which falls to the floor. shaking his hand, he rises distractedly, pokes his head through a swinging door.}
