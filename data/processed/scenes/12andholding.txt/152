<L>__{interior yacco's office reception area next day afternoon}
<A>__{yacco exits her office to find gus waiting for his session. they speak not a word. he rises and enters the office. she follows, shutting the door behind her.}
<L>__{interior yacco's office continuous}
<A>__{gus and yacco sit in their respective seats.}
<C>__{yacco}
<D>__{before we begin, i want to apologize. i should have known what was going on with malee.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{it's my fault. i knew she had a crush on me. i guess, i felt bad for her. she's a very unhappy girl.}
<A>__{yacco looks down, embarrassed.}
<C>__{gus }
<D>__{if it's any consolation, the whole thing was very "therapeutic" for me.}
<P>__{(off yacco's look)}
<D>__{sorry. that was a very selfish thing to say.}
<C>__{yacco}
<D>__{this is your therapy. not mine. why was it therapeutic?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i slept last night. i can't remember the last time i slept so deep or so sound. i don't remember dreaming or anything.}
<C>__{yacco}
<D>__{why do you think that is?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{one of the last fires i ever fought was a brownstone, beautiful. the place was burned from roof to basement. whole family was wiped out. when i was upstairs, inspecting, i found a girl. she couldn't have been more than 12.}
<P>__{(more)}
<C>__{gus }
<D>__{the whole right side of her face was burnt off, but her eyes were open. she was alive. the pain must have been excruciating. she was begging for me to... kill her.}
<C>__{yacco}
<D>__{what did you do?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{exactly what she wanted. i placed my hand over her mouth and what was left of her nose, and i... i killed her. i told myself it was the right thing to do, but i've never been sure.}
<C>__{yacco}
<D>__{what does this have to do with malee?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{when i saw her last night, she had the same look on her face as that girl. she just wanted me to take away her pain.}
<A>__{yacco sits, pondering all of this.}
<C>__{gus }
<D>__{doctor?}
<C>__{yacco}
<D>__{would you mind if we... cut out early today? no charge.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i understand.}
<A>__{gus rises and exits. yacco sits alone and starts crying.}
