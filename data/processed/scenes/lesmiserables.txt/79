<A>__{through a crack in a door, we see marius sitting on a tatty mattress in a tiny hovel of a room. he is taking out a hunting rifle from under the mattress, wrapped in a rag. his eye is caught by the ring on his finger. close on a signet ring, a family crest. marius stares at the ring then takes it off his finger. we reveal eponine staring at him through the door.}
