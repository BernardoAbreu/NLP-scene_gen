<L>__{interior television mobile unit}
<A>__{at least eight monitors, reflecting the outputs of three cameras and two tape machines, as well as line, preview, and effects monitors. monitor: camera 1: holding on a group of happy citizen bathers as they unpack their gear, wave to camera, run into the water. monitor: camera 2: the repellent line, set in place by coast guardsmen in small boats, setting out floats, dumping repellent into the ocean. monitor: camera 3: close on the bandstand, where amity's band is playing lilting patriotic airs. after we've seen this activity, we can take a look at what's going on: the preparation of the tape segment for the six o'clock news.}
<C>__{tv director}
<D>__{put 1 on the line. in five. 4. 3. 2. 1. roll.}
<A>__{on the "tape 1" and "line" monitors, we see vaughn being interviewed by the announcer in the blazer.}
<C>__{announcer}
<D>__{...and with me is the mayor of amity, lawrence vaughn. mr. vaughn, how about those rumors?}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{how about them indeed. i'm pleased and happy to repeat the news that we have, in fact, caught and killed a large predator that supposedly injured some bathers here. as you can see, it's a beautiful day, the beaches are open, and the folks here are having a wonderful time. amity, y'know, means 'friendship.'}
<A>__{monitor: camera 1: as vaughn speaks to us on the monitors, the monitor for camera 1 pans over to show a sightseeing bus pull up in the parking area, and a horde of media vultures spilling out, carrying cameras with long lenses and tripods, telescopes, sunshades and parasols, all the equipment of the curious and none of the equipment of the holiday bather or swimmer. tape 1 and line monitors: close on the announcer, vaughn out of the picture.}
<C>__{announcer}
<D>__{also here today is a marine biologist and research fellow from the oceanographic institute, matthew hooper. mr. hooper, what've you heard?}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{what i've heard and what i've seen are two different things. i believe there is a large great white shark carcharodon cacharias in the waters off this very beach, that he has killed and that he will kill again...}
<A>__{hooper's voice fades off as someone at the mixer panel dials his mike off, and brings up the announcer's lavalier.}
<C>__{announcer}
<P>__{(moving into center frame)}
<D>__{and there you have it two different opinions, by men of good will. the holiday crowd here at amity seems to be making up its own mind...}
<A>__{the camera pans off him to a happy family headed for the beach. monitor: camera 3: zooms in on the puffing face of the tuba player. monitor: camera 2: brody and the announcer. monitor: tape 1 and line: back on the announcer, his lips moving, but his sound turned off. we hear, instead, the sound from monitor camera 2, brody and the same announcer.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i just don't have the time.}
<C>__{tv director}
<D>__{recue the machines. 2, pan off the chief and show me some tits and ass. 1, get me some cute kids. 3... see if you got a shot at the water.}
<A>__{monitors: cameras 1, 2 and 3: the cameras seek out the appropriate activity as the director calls for it.}
<C>__{assistant director}
<P>__{(holds up stopwatch)}
<D>__{mayor, 43 seconds, biologist 45 seconds. that's equal time, right?}
<C>__{director}
<D>__{right.}
<P>__{(he presses "talkback"}
<D>__{button to his}
<P>__{announcer)}
<D>__{jerry, come on in and look at this.}
<P>__{(to his headset)}
<D>__{roll 2. in five, 4. 3. 2. 1.}
<A>__{tape 2 monitor: starts showing us the assembled interview segment we've just seen, starting with the announcer's opening remarks.}
<C>__{announcer }
<D>__{amity island is famed for its clear air and white sand beaches. but a cloud appeared...}
<A>__{his voice is dialed under as the announcer himself appears in the control room to watch himself on the monitors.}
<C>__{announcer }
<D>__{look at that shine on my nose. it's a beacon.}
<C>__{director}
<D>__{close enough for remote.}
<A>__{as vaughn begins his spiel again, the other monitors show us the action on the beach.}
<C>__{vaughn }
<D>__{...i'm pleased and happy...}
<C>__{director}
<D>__{think we ought to stick around?}
<C>__{announcer}
<D>__{what else you got?}
<C>__{assistant director}
<D>__{teachers' strike downtown.}
<C>__{cameraman's voice }
<D>__{christenson, this is al. union says time for engineering five.}
<C>__{director}
<D>__{that's five minutes, guys. coffee.}
<B>__{angle on the beach}
<A>__{vaughn is in his shirtsleeves, having slipped out of his jacket. he mops his brow, and surveys the beachfront. at this moment, there's nobody swimming. he approaches a familiar selectman, nods hello, and squats beside him on the sand.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{why don't you get in the water?}
<C>__{selectman}
<D>__{i don't want to wash off my suntan lotion. i will get a burn...}
<C>__{vaughn}
<P>__{(some urgency)}
<D>__{nobody's going in!}
<A>__{on an adjoining blanket, a spirited ruth gordon type is sitting, watching brightly as her manservant, a polished eric harrison type, prepares some tea from a thermos.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{is there nobody going in? what a shame. arthur, should i be going in?}
<C>__{arthur }
<P>__{(pouring tea)}
<D>__{if you'd like.}
<A>__{he puts down the tea service, and leads her towards the water. at the edge of the sea, she stops, and he walks in.}
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(as he enters the waves)}
<D>__{it's very nice. not too cold... quite refreshing... very pleasant....}
<A>__{he ducks his head under for a final look around. his dripping head rises triumphantly from the surf.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{no sharks, m'lady.}
<A>__{she starts into the water, he takes her parasol, escorting her the rest of the way into the ocean.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{this is marvelous! arthur, i want to come back to this very spot. will you make a note of where we are?}
<A>__{wide on the beach encouraged by the sight of the woman and arthur, and vaughn's quiet urgings, people begin to wander into the surf, a few at first, and then a rush, as people plunge in and begin enjoying the pleasures of ocean bathing. the selectman goes in, his family follows, vaughn watches it all, beaming. boat #7 hendricks is on the radio while a coast guard spotter works the sonar.}
<C>__{hendricks}
<D>__{anything? thought i saw a shadow. over.}
<A>__{pan to the water.}
<B>__{underwater}
<A>__{as before, 400 pairs of enticing, yummy swimmers' legs, kicking like animated hors d'oeuvres.}
