<A>__{early is driving. brian riding shotgun, is making some notes in his manuscript. adele is teaching a reluctant carrie to play a card game called "snap."}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{...hey you're good. thought you said you never played before?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{i haven't... i'm a fast learner.}
<B>__{on early and brian}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{...they never caught that black dolya killer, huh?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{dahlia, no.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{now why is that?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{some people think it's because he never killed again. he just disappeared back into society.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{you don't sound too convinced 'bout that?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{i always thought it was the work of a serial killer. anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. and again. until someone stopped him.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{that your... "theory", ain't that what they call it?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{you wanna hear mine?}

<A>__{brian hands early the hand held tape recorder.}
<C>__{early}
<P>__{(into tape)}
<D>__{well i will just bet he's still alive. old, livin' in some trailer park or somethin' somewhere, but still alive. thinkin' every night 'bout what he done. goin' over and over it in his mind. how smart he was for getting away with it.}
<A>__{carrie is chilled by the intensity of early's remark. she watches him out of the corner of her eye. smack! adele's hand hits the pile of cards and she wins the game. startled, carrie turns back to adele.}
<C>__{adele}
<P>__{(to carrie)}
<D>__{you lose!}
<C>__{brian}
<P>__{(to early)}
<D>__{i suppose anything's possible.}
<A>__{brian puts one leg across the other and goes back to his notes. new angle: close up brian's shoe revealing... the blood encrusted toe of his shoe. new angle: cu on early}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{you ever play any pool bri'?}
