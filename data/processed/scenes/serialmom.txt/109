<A>__{mrs. ackerman and mrs. hinkle look up in amazement as they see the sutphins pull into church parking lot followed by string of police cars. the sutphins nervously get out of car and walk towards church as the good christian families glare at them and gossip with a vengeance. dad tries to be brave, misty hangs her head in mortification, chip is excited by all the attention and mom smiles happily to appalled worshippers. gus and sloppy, the two garbagemen, dressed in their shabby church clothes wave to mom in secret admiration. birdie's eyes light up at seeing chip but her suddenly forbidding parents hold her back when she tries to join him. she mouths "i love you" to him as chip looks back to her parents with hurt and confusion. as the sutphin family reaches the church door, a reporter runs towards them with his cameras drawn.}
