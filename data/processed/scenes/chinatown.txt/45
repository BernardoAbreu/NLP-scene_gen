<L>__{exterior avocado groves day}
<A>__{gittes is shocked. he looks behind him. riding on horseback down the field in the direction he had just driven is a red faced man in overalls. his hat blows off his head. he does not, however, lose the shotgun he has just used. gittes' lane of retreat is denied him. he guns the car, and takes off down one of the orchard lanes.}
<B>__{moving with gittes}
<A>__{the dirt lane is rough. as gittes nears the end of it, a younger man on a mule blocks the exit. gittes veers a sharp left, knocking a branch off one of the trees, heading down one of the cross lanes. here he's pursued by a scraggly dog that nips at the tires. gittes yells at it.}
<B>__{angle on grove}
<A>__{two farmers on foot, one using a crutch, run down the lanes toward a dust trail rising above the trees. they've spotted it. clearly it's from gittes' car. this hide and seek chase between one man on horseback, one on a mule and a couple on foot continues up and down and across the orchard lanes until gittes' front tire and radiator are ruptured by another shotgun blast. gittes' car veers off, scattering a stray gaggle of geese and smacks into an avocado tree, shaking loose a barrage of the heavy fruit onto gittes and the car. gittes immediately tries to get out through the branches over the back of his car, but he's pulled off it by one of the younger farmers, a huge brute who he begins to tussle with. the crippled farmer begins to bang gittes on the back with his crutch. the two of them manage to pound gittes to the ground within moments, where the crippled farmer continues to whack away at gittes with the crutch. the older red faced farmer with the shotgun and the man on a mule ride up.}
<C>__{red faced farmer}
<D>__{all right, quit it! quit now! search the man, see if he's armed.}
<A>__{gittes is hefted half off the ground and the two younger farmers spin him around, going through his clothes. gittes is badly banged up and half out on his feet. they toss his wallet, his silver cigarette case, etc. on the ground.}
<C>__{red faced farmer}
<D>__{i said see if he's armed, not empty his pockets.}
<C>__{big farmer}
<D>__{he ain't armed.}

<C>__{red faced farmer}
<D>__{all right, mister. who you with? water department or the real estate office?}
<A>__{gittes' back is to the red faced farmer. he has trouble catching his breath. the crippled farmer pokes him rudely in the back with his crutch. gittes turns sharply.}

<D>__{mrs. evelyn mulwray.}
<C>__{big farmer}
<D>__{mulwray? that's the son of a bitch who's done it to us.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{mulwray's dead. you don't know what you're talking about, you dumb oakie.}
<A>__{the big farmer takes a swing at gittes. gittes kicks him squarely in the nuts, knees him in the jaw after he's doubled up, and hits him solidly. the crippled farmer takes careful aim and brings his crutch down on the back of gittes' head. gittes is knocked to the ground and lies still beside the big farmer who is writhing in agony in the dirt.}
<C>__{red faced farmer}
<D>__{well, that's that.}
<B>__{black screen}
<A>__{there's a purling sound, which soon becomes defined into the sound of voices talking quietly about whether to move or not to move, doctors, etc.}

<D>__{you didn't look too good, so we thought we better call your employer.}
<A>__{gittes nods. he checks his watch. he looks out. it's almost evening. gittes says nothing. the wife of the red faced farmer (dubois) looks reproachfully at dubois. gittes feels the back of his head, it obviously hurts him.}
