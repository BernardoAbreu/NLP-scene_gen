<C>__{jo}
<D>__{yes sir... this past friday evening. two marines, corporal harold dawson and private louden downey, entered the barracks room of a pfc william santiago and assaulted him. santiago died at the base hospital approximately an hour later. the nis agent who took their statements maintains they were trying to prevent santiago from naming them in a fenceline shooting incident. they're scheduled to have a hearing down in cuba at 4:00 this afternoon.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{what's the problem?}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{dawson and downey are both recruiting poster marines and santiago was known to be a screw up. i was thinking that it sounded an awful lot like a code red.}
<A>__{jo lets this sink in a moment.}
<C>__{west}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{christ.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{i'd like them moved up to washington and assigned counsel. someone who can really look into this. someone who possesses not only the legal skill, but a familiarity with the inner workings of the military. in short, captain, i'd like to suggest that... i be the one who, that it be me who is assigned to represent them.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{myself.}
<A>__{jo looks around the room for a response.}
<C>__{west}

<C>__{jo}
<D>__{thank you, sir, i'm fine.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{joanne, i'd like you to leave the room so we can talk about you behind your back.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{certainly, sir.}
<A>__{jo gets up and walks out.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{i thought this code red shit wasn't going on anymore.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{with the marines at gitmo? who the hell knows what goes on down there.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{well lets find out before the rest of the world does, this thing could get messy. what about this woman?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{jo's been working a desk at internal affairs for what, almost a year now.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{and before that?}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{she disposed of three cases in two years.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{three cases in two years? who was she handling, the rosenbergs?}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{she's not cut out for litigation.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{she's a hall of an investigator, jerry }
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{in internal affairs, sure. she can crawl up a lawyer's ass with the best of 'em, but when it comes to trial work }
<C>__{west}

<D>__{and i will have division assign them counsel...}
<C>__{jo}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but... not me.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{from what i understand from your colleagues, you're much too valuable in your present assignment to be wasted on what i'm sure will boil down to a five minute plea bargain and a week's worth of paper work.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{sir }
<C>__{west}
<D>__{don't worry about it. i promise you, division'll assign the right man for the job.}
