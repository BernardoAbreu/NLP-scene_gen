"but i don't care man. i'm just doing this for the dough." we learn that harvey is a reluctant participant in a film being made about his life. suddenly, his third wife joyce brabner an intelligent control freak obsessed with all things negative joins in the conversation. pushing back her huge glasses, she reprimands harvey like he is an infant: "harvey you are talking too loud, harvey you are being difficult." harvey just rolls his eyes. joyce gets offended. it is clear they have had this argument a million times. as joyce storms off... harvey explains that his wife is trying to take over the movie. he laments that she is his third wife, and he has no luck with women. "man, chicks just don't dig me." that's why he marries anyone who will have him. "and i marry them fast before they get to know the real me..."}
