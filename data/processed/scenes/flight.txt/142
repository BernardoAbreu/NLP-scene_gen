<A>__{we pan across the concrete cell wall, looking at a small, personal photo collage. we see a photo of nicole and sheila and a few other aa folks surrounding whip who sits in front of a birthday cake in the common room of the prison. we see a photo of whip's dad as an airman. we ultimately land on a photo of nicole. we recognize it as the photo whip took on the porch of the whitaker farm. we pan down to find whip writing in a journal. a guard comes to the front of his cell.}
