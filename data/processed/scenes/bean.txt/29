<D>__{then we are agreed, gentlemen. he goes.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{only if we're positive that the new catalogue database will render mr. bean's hitherto 'talents' obsolete.}
<C>__{hubert}
<D>__{there's no question.}
<C>__{lord walton}
<D>__{very well. mr bean is.... art history. we can all stop taking the pills.}
<A>__{a reserved smatter of laughter, from relief more than anything. lord w. talks into an intercom on the table.}
<C>__{lord walton}
<D>__{miss hutchinson, would you send mr. bean up to the boardroom, please.}
<C>__{miss hutchinson}
<P>__{(v o )}
<D>__{yes sir. oh, and lord walton, the grierson gallery called again.}
<C>__{lord walton}
<D>__{thank you. (to the room) one final thing. once again we have been invited by the grierson gallery of southern california to second one of our staff for a short visit. the grierson has a fairly modest collection but it does include the most famous american painting of all, 'whistler's mother'. any thoughts?}
<A>__{cut to the trustees they shake their heads and wrinkle, their noses, not very interested. a 106 year old sir rupert puts up his hand.}
<C>__{lord walton}
<D>__{yes. sir rupert. and may i say sir, how honoured we are that you still grace us with all your time, wisdom, and infinite knowledge. your invaluable thoughts, sir?}
<C>__{sir rupert}
<D>__{could you speak up please. i didn't catch the question.}
