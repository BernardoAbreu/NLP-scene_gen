<A>__{the door opens. sam and charlie walk into the dark room.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{where are we going?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it's a surprise.}
<A>__{sam flips the switch, bathing the room in light. sam's room is so cool. a shrine to music. a xerox that says "the beatings will continue until morale improves." virgin mary icons. snow globes. kitsch.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{is this your room? it's so cool.}

<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you got me a present?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{with all that help on my penn state application? of course i did. open it.}
<A>__{charlie lifts up the box to reveal an old manual typewriter.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i don't know what to say.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you don't have to say anything.}
<A>__{sam goes over and types. "write about us sometime." he smiles and types back. "i will." they look at each other. we can hear a lovely ballad playing downstairs.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{i'm sorry we can't be here for your birthday.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{that's okay. i'm just sorry you have to go back and visit your dad.}
<C>__{sam}

<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you are.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{me? what about you? when i met you, you were this scared freshman. and look at you in that suit. you're like a sexy english school boy. i saw mary elizabeth checking you out.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(innocent laugh)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{innocent. worst kind of guys. never see you coming. and parents love you. that's like... extra danger.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{well, it hasn't worked so far.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{come on. you've never had a girlfriend? not even a 2nd grade valentine?}
<A>__{he shakes his head.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{have you ever kissed a girl?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{no. what about you?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{have i ever kissed a girl?}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{no! your first kiss...}
<A>__{sam gets this strange look in her eyes. a little haunted.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{my first kiss? i was 11. his name was robert. he would come over to the house all the time.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{was he your first boyfriend?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{he was my dad's boss.}
<A>__{charlie goes silent.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{you know charlie, i used to sleep with guys who treated me like shit. and get wasted all the time. but now... i feel like i have a chance. i could even get into a real college.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it's true. you can do it.}
<C>__{sam}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{my aunt... she had that same thing done to her, too. and she turned her life around.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{she must have been great.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{she was my favorite person in the world... until now.}
<A>__{sam smiles. she's very moved.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{charlie, i know that you know i like craig. but i want to forget that for a minute. okay? i just want to make sure that the first person who kisses you loves you. okay?}
<A>__{charlie nods. and with that, sam leans over and kisses him. it starts softly, then sam wraps her thin arms around him. holding on for lonely life. when the song crescendos, and they part, charlie and sam look at each other. finally...}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{i love you, charlie.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i love you, too.}
