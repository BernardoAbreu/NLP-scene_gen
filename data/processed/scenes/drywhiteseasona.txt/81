<L>__{exterior soweto cemetery morning}
<A>__{the large soweto cemetery has scores of graves ready for burials. the chief mourners, emily, robert, his sister, margaret, four relatives and stanley are standing on either side of the priest. gordon's coffin is in the grave; several wreaths are on the side of the grave. there are about fifteen hundred mourners, and half are youths. there are several local reporters and overseas television reporters. the police are in attendance in large numbers at the edge of the crowd, some in battle dress and some with dogs.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{before i conclude, i have to say we are tired of making this journey every day, sometimes twice in one day, burying our children, and those, like our departed brother, ngubene who were merely seeking the truth; and those who have been denounced by traitors amongst us; and those who have been brutally killed for no reason, yes i shall say it, by the police. let those who rule this land of ours listen to the word of god; let them listen to our peaceful and just demands; let them be humble and go down on their knees and seek forgiveness, then listen to god.}
<A>__{the crowd roars: "amanda! amanda!" the priest starts a short hymn and the crowd joins in. at the end of the hymn.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{we will have a few words from mr. pilani our father and leader.}
<A>__{the crowd starts singing a freedom song with arms raised. the funeral has now become a political demonstration. mr. pilani, who is a dignified, educated 70 years old, walks slowly and waits beside the chief mourners. he is handed a loudspeaker. a senior police officer threads his way through the crowd, a loud hailer in his hand. as he reaches the grave he turns. the crowd is quiet. he says something to the priest then addresses the crowd.}
<C>__{senior officer}
<D>__{the funeral is over. i order everyone to go home. this is not a political rally. i repeat, disperse.}
<A>__{as though by signal the police start attacking the mourners with truncheons and dogs. there is pandemon ium, women screaming, people falling into graves or covering in them. the priest and stanley lead emily and the family away in the opposite direction. the press and television are recording the scene. the police start throwing tear gas canisters. there is no confrontation, the crowd is fleeing in all directions. one television cameraman is purposely pushed into a grave by a very young policeman, his round recordist is pulled up into the adjourning grave by the connecting cord. melanie stands on a tombstone watching and making notes.}
