<L>__{exterior wall e's truck day}
<A>__{wall e rolls up to a nearby trash pile. scoops up trash. spits out a cube. eve hovers over to him. still in disbelief.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(somber)}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{wall e continues to stack his cubes. she stops him. lifts his head. stares into his eyes. nobody home. eve presses his "play" button. nothing but static. eve begins to panic. shakes him.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{wall e...wall e! wall e!}
<A>__{no response. he's gone. she hovers in silence next to him for a long time... finally, eve grasps wall e's hand. forces his fingers to interlace with hers. holds him close one last time. leans her head against his. hums softly.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{[hums iotam]}
<A>__{she touches her forehead to his. goodbye wall e. a tiny spark between them. eve turns to hover away. jerked back. her fingers caught between his. she checks his eyes again. nothing. but then... ...a tiny servo noise. she looks down at their hands. close on wall e's fingers they start to move. slowly close around eve's. she looks back at his face. wall e's eyes gradually come into focus. his brows raise...}
<D>__{wall e ee vah?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{wall e!}
<A>__{he notices their hands entwined. his dream come true.}
<D>__{wall e}

<D>__{ee vah!!}
<A>__{she giggles.}

<A>__{the "hello dolly" tape reaches the finale of iotam. "and that is all that love's about..."}
<B>__{back outside}
<A>__{eve and wall e stare into each other's eyes. m o and the rejects finally reach the truck. they begin to celebrate. wall e's alive! then m o realizes they need privacy. herds the rejects o.s.}
<D>__{m o go! go, go go!}
<A>__{wall e and eve's foreheads touch. together now and ever more. "...and we'll recall when time runs out..."}
