<L>__{interior hospital day}
<A>__{clough visits peter taylor in a large, crowded ward of old, infirm, dying people. it's a shock.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{heart attack, eh?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{had it three weeks ago, they reckon.}
<C>__{taylor }
<D>__{they ran all kinds of tests. asked me about my diet and my family history.}
<P>__{(mo re)}
<C>__{tay lor }
<D>__{i told them the only thing they needed to know was that i share my professional life with brian clough. that seemed to satisfy them.}
<A>__{clough manages a smile. moved.}
<C>__{taylor }
<D>__{i'm only half joking, you know. have we still got jobs?}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{we have. longson's tried to put a gagging order on me, of course.}
<P>__{(mimics)}
<D>__{"any further utterances in public or appearances in the media by brian clough will be met with instant dismissal."}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{well, i hope you take notice. and act accordingly.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{would you like to hear my contrite reply?}
<A>__{clough pulls out a letter..}
<C>__{clough }
<D>__{"due to the complete breakdown in communication with the chairman, peter taylor and i find it is impossible to continue our good work for derby county. we therefore wish to tender our resignations with immediate effect."}
<C>__{taylor}
<P>__{(horrified)}
<D>__{what??!?}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{i don't want to resign.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{no. nor do i. don't worry, they'll never let us. we just won them the championship. but it will strengthen our position and force them to get rid of longson.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{what? oh, no, brian. they'll never do that. he's chairman.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{i can't do it, pete. i can't work with my hands tied, a chairman telling me what i can or cannot do.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{you're picking the wrong enemy. the enemy's not longson. it's revie. and your obsession with leeds.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{don't be daft. we won the league, pete. we're top dogs in derby now. and longson can't stand it. that's the problem.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{no, it's not. it's you. this monster in you. this mad ambition. it comes and goes. sometimes it's good...a fire, that stirs everything up, and then there's this...this thing that takes you over...and destroys everything that is good in your life.}
<A>__{taylor's face...}
<C>__{taylor }
<D>__{please tell me this letter is just a draft. you haven't sent it. because i will be out in a couple of days...let me talk to them.}
