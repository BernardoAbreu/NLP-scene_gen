<ACTION_ALT>__{SCREEN IS BLACK}
<ACTION>__{In the darkness we hear dripping water, the echoing approach of two sets of footsteps. There is the sound of a sudden, quick scuffle, a heavy fall of bodies. THREE BOOMING GUNSHOTS. Two from one gun, one from another. So fast and close, they're barely distinguish- able. The sound of the SHOTS ECHOES against concrete walls and dies away. Silence. SLOW, SLOW, FADE IN:}

A gun drops heavily from  his hand. His life ebbs as he slides slowly down the car  door to his knees then falls forward, face down on the  cement floor. A SLOW PULL BACK reveals that FRANK is lying on top of KLINGMAN. Protectively pressed body to body on the filthy cement floor of the garage. Klingman, a handsome,}

<ACTION>__{Passing traffic reveals the storefront of a TV showroom. Inside, behind the reflections of the city lights, all the TV sets are showing the same picture, the glittering image of a woman singing. (We will recognize the woman as Rachel Marron.) We cut tighter and tighter on the image until it is almost broken up into its scanning lines. Through the city noise comes the sound of her song "I have Nothing."}
<LOC>__{INT. DAN'S APARTMENT - DESK TOP - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{A battered old desk.  Scattered across the top -- a pile of blank white paper, a jar of glue, a stack of magazines, a pair of scissors, a TV remote control, softly in the b.g., a TV is playing the same image we saw in the store window, the same song. Hands appear. Male hands. They open a drawer and remove a pair of translucent rubber gloves. Carefully they put the gloves on. The SNAPPING of the rubber is the only sound. The hands pick a magazine off the stack: Screen Stars. They put the magazine down and pick up the scissors. A headline on the cover reads: "RACHEL MARRON'S GREATEST TRIUMPH!" The scissors start to cut. Meticulously they excise the name "RACHEL MARRON" from the page. With the care of a surgeon.}
<LOC>__{EXT. HOLLYWOOD PREMIERE - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{A tumultuous crash of screaming, pushing bodies. Arms stretch out, cameras flash, sunguns flare, microphones are thrust forward. A deafening cacophony of "Rachel! Rachel! Rachel! Over here! Over here! This way, Rachel! Rachel! Rachel!" We cannot see the object of this frenzy. We catch a brief glimpse of an attractive, well-dressed young woman (NICKI), exiting with the other celebrities, as she is pushed and casually jostled aside by the mass of surging fans and media. Her face is calm and impassive as she watches from the sidelines.}

Hands of Rachel's entourage accept some of the proffered items. In CLOSEUP, we see Rachel's hands signing "Best wishes, Rachel Marron" on an out-stretched open palm. In the midst of the urgent forest of hands and paper, a be- ribboned black doll is thrust forward, bearing the legend "RACHEL, WE LOVE YOU."}

He looks at rampant foliage and overgrown grass. Supermarket circulars cover his doorstep. He picks up a few and fishes a bunch of keys from his pocket. A curious neighbor peers from behind a net curtain. As the door opens, we are aware of a further pile of mail inside. Frank's feet push the letters aside and go inside. The door shuts.}

At the stove he stirs and flavors a Boeuf Bourgignon and reads a Time magazine. He adds a splash of wine. He lifts the pot from the stove and tries a piece of meat. At the table, he looks at the place setting and absently eats another piece of meat. Finally he sets the pot on the plate and eats from it directly while glancing through the magazine.}

Through the blur and bustle, we glimpse the doll with its embroidered ribbon message "RACHEL, WE LOVE YOU." Hands casually move it to one side, among the flowers resting on the small portable TV set.

<LOC>__{EXT. MARRON ESTATE - WAVERLY LANE (BEL AIR) - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Frank stops his nondescript Chevy across the quiet street from the closed, unmanned gate at the bottom of the Marron driveway. FRANK'S POV as he looks over the gate, the wall, the heavy vegetation and the rising grounds beyond. (NOTE: The use of the term FRANK'S POV, is not to be taken simply as a camera direction. Rather, it re- presents a recurring attempt to make the audience see in the special way Frank sees. Frank lives by constant vigilance, heightened awareness. It is his genius and his burden. The audience must be put in the position of looking, searching, scanning with him.) He has a curious sense of being watched, a kind of prick- ling on the back of his neck. As he looks around, a black Toyota 4X4, parked some way down the road, drives rapidly off -- too fast to get a clear look. He watches it go. Frank pulls up   to the gate and gets out of his car. He grabs a bar of   the gate and pulls. The whole gate rattles. Frank    gets back in his car and pushes a button on the intercom   box at the side of the gate. A MAN'S VOICE CRACKLES   out of the BOX. Transmission is terrible.}

On the opposite wall are shelves containing the trophies of Rachel Marron's career: A Tony award, three Grammy's, gold and platinum records, other statuettes and plaques. Among the framed photo- graphs of Rachel accepting awards etc., is one of her and her small son, FLETCHER, dressed in a tuxedo. Both are goofing off for the camera with obvious affection. Frank looks down at the pool. FRANK'S POV Dwarfed by the pool, the only person in sight is seven- year old Fletcher, the little boy from the photograph, dark-haired and fragile. He is crouched at the side of the pool with the remote control unit for a foot-long speedboat which is cutting across the water. A nanny sits, some way off, embroidering. Frank's attention is distracted. A heavier BASS MUSICAL BEAT comes from somewhere nearby in the house, another Rachel Marron number, but this time up-tempo and bouncy. Frank follows the sound.}
<LOC>__{INT. FAMILY ROOM - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Frank walks into the rear of the room that the noise is coming from. It is large and comfortable with plenty of seating, a bar, a wall of stereo gear and a projection booth. It is packed with people, props and video equipment. There is lots of activity, a general air of barely-organized chaos. MUSIC BLARES out. A group of six dancers, is rehearsing an energetic dance number for a music video, directed by their choreographer RORY. Sunlight throws them in a silhouette against the glass wall at the end of the room. A video cameraman circles them, taping the rehearsal, which appears on a large-screen TV behind them. In one corner, a pretty black girl is being pinned into a proposed costume for the video. Several people are stand- ing around, tending to the video and playback gear. All the chairs face the far end of the room and it isn't immediately apparent how many more people are hidden among the big cushions. As Frank sits on the barstool at the back, a large swivel chair turns to reveal Devaney. He waves to Frank and makes his way over to him. On the other side of the room, a brawny, heavyset man in his late thirties rises to look at Frank. He has a twenty inch neck. Devaney signals to him  that everything is all right. The brawny man looks at Frank a moment more, then sits down. Frank looks around the room. A shelf laden with vitamins. Guitars of various makes. A flute. A gold record being used as a coaster. People smoking and chatting through the rehearsal. In one of the chairs, a pretty  woman in her  mid-thirties (NICKI, the woman we saw at the  premiere) is  knitting. She glances occasionally at the  dancers. A   man sits next to a phone busily discussing a  contract with  someone at the other end of the line. The music climaxes and abruptly stops. The dancers hold their dramatic final poses for a second, then relax again. APPLAUSE. The CLAPPING from the front sofa is loudest. Then LAUGHTER.
