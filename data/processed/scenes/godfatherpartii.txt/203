<L>__{interior new genco warehouse day}
<A>__{a newly acquired warehouse, stocked with cases of the new product "genco pura" olive oil. it is the beginning of a new business, in the american tradition. now they have one rattling old truck, and a few stock boys. genco has become the accountant business manager, based on the experience working with his father. but it is clear, that vito is the leader, and undisputed 'president' of the new enterprise. genco moves through the darkness of the warehouse, to the small divided area that vito uses as his office.}
<C>__{genco}
<P>__{(sicilian)}
<D>__{the 'patrone' is here.}
<C>__{vito}
<D>__{chi?}
<C>__{genco}
<D>__{roberto. who owns the 'rat holes.'}
<A>__{vito nods that he will see him; and soon roberto enters, on tiptoe, his hat in his hand, and in a apologetic voice.}
<C>__{roberto}
<D>__{excuse me, i hope i am not a disturbance, don corleone.}
<C>__{vito}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{roberto}
<D>__{what a terrible misunderstanding. of course, signora colombo can stay in the flat. who were those miserable tenants to complain about noise from a poor animal...when they pay such low rent.}
<A>__{then abruptly, he puts the roll of money on vito's table, and steps back a respectful distance.}
<C>__{roberto}
<D>__{your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and i want to show that i, too, have some christian charity. her rent will remain what it was.}
<C>__{vito}
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{roberto}
<D>__{in fact, reduced, bu five dollars!}
<A>__{vito embraces him warmly.}
<C>__{vito}
<D>__{i accept your generosity...}
<C>__{roberto}
<D>__{i won't keep you another minute...}
<A>__{he quickly takes his leave, bowing several times, and then makes it back to the safety of the warehouse; he sighs, deflates his lungs, and mops his brow; his bones have turned too jelly with fear at his narrow escape. he all but runs out of the warehouse. genco laughs as he watches.}
<C>__{genco}
<D>__{we won't see him for weeks! he'll stay in bed in the bronx!}
<A>__{clemenza has been waiting with his new mechanic. we notice the subtle difference in the way he treats vito. he is no longer a junior apprentice in their petty crimes; but an imposing leader.}
<C>__{clemenza}
<D>__{this kid is good with cars; he kiijed at the truck, and says he can keep it going.}
<A>__{vito looks over the lanky young man.}
<C>__{clemenza}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{hyman}
<D>__{suchowsky. hyman suchowsky.}
<C>__{clemenza}
<D>__{he's gonna dump that; i call him johnny lips.}
<C>__{vito}
<D>__{who is the greatest man you can think of?}
<C>__{clemenza}
<D>__{go on, answer him when he talks to you. tell him: columbus, marconi... garibaldi.}
<C>__{hyman}
<D>__{arnold rothstein.}
<C>__{vito}
<D>__{then take that as your name: hyman rothstein.}
<A>__{genco is out in the alley; he calls out with glee.}
<C>__{genco}
<D>__{vitone! look at this!}
<A>__{vito moves out to the smiling genco; clemenza and the newly christened hyman rothstein follow a distance behind.}
