<L>__{interior passenger cabin day}
<A>__{the passengers are pressed into their seats like blades of grass as the breeze of the plane's momentum moves them towards flight. the main lights in the cabin go out and the small glow of the aisle lights lead us back to the cockpit.}
<L>__{interior airplane cockpit day}
<A>__{whip mans the stick as he squints his eyes and tries to keep the nose between the lights of the runway.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{it's like a video game, right?}
<A>__{whip laughs and turns to his copilot. evans is visibly nervous as he begins the take off check...}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{airspeed's alive, both sides... engine instruments are in the green...100 knots crosscheck...}
<A>__{the jr 88 fishtails as the main gear begins to hydroplane.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{yep, nothing like a little 30 knot cross wind to exercise that sphincter muscle.}
<A>__{evans is jostled violently.}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{that's wind shear! a micro burst!}
<A>__{whip's eyes are focused on the end of the runway. the red threshold lights are approaching fast. the plane is not lifting off.}
<C>__{evans }
<D>__{less than a thousand feet to go!}
<A>__{whip snaps at him.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{just watch my airspeed!}
<A>__{c.u. the airspeed indicator reads 145...}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{v1...and...}
<A>__{now the air speed indicator climbs to 160...}
<C>__{evans }
<D>__{...rotate.}
<A>__{whip pulls back on the yoke, and... the plane jerks up and we can hear the fuselage flex as we leave the ground. the plane is immediately buffeted by severe turbulence.}
<C>__{evans }
<D>__{that's wind shear for sure!}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{yeehaw! ride `em cowboy.}
