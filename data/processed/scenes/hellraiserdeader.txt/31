<L>__{interior train station later}
<A>__{the train is still there, doors open. there are transit cops on the station, disgruntled passengers hanging out on the platform... track workers are poking around underneath it. amy is leaning against one of the metal pillars, staring at the empty bench at the place where the mysterious figure was sitting. she's looking grim. behind her, a track worker approaches the driver, who's standing with a pair of transit cops. he's shaking his head, shrugging. the driver curses, heads back toward the first car. one of the cops approaches amy.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{well, the men have looked.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{and there's nothing there?}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{you don't seem terribly surprised.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{hmm?}
<A>__{there's a sudden hiss. amy turns as the train doors close.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{i mean, you don't seem terribly surprised that there isn't somebody under the train. a}
<C>__{my}
<D>__{i don't know what to say. i saw him...}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{yeah. that's the thing. can you tell me again, just what it is that you saw?}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{um, i was standing on the platform...}
<A>__{the train starts to move out of the station. amy looks toward it. the train is moving on one of the center tracks, so that you can look through the windows of the cars and see through them to the platform on the far side.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{...and, um... i saw this man standing on the edge of the platform, facing away from it.}
<A>__{but now amy is seeing something through the windows of the moving train. on the platform on the far side, there is a lone figure, the man in the black trench coat. amy jumps, looks more closely.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{did he say anyth...}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{it's him.!}
<A>__{in an instant, amy is tearing down the platform, heading for the stairs that connect to the platform on the other side.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{hey...}
<A>__{amy is watching, staring through the moving train windows. the figures are still there. winter is staring at her }
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{hey, stop! tomislav! tomislav!}
<A>__{n the next instant, the cop is giving chase, and another cop, clearly, the "tomislav" called by the first cop, further down the station, is rushing in to head amy off.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{it's them! over there, over there!}
<A>__{n the next instant, tomislav tackles amy and she goes down on her face. even with the rather large cop on top of her, she's still struggling.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{god damn it, get off of me! get the hell off of me... get...}
<A>__{she keeps struggling as the first cop, and the others on the station, converge on her. she looks toward the far platform. the figure is still there, visible through the windows of the departing train. then, the last car of the train passes, leaving an unencumbered view of the far side. the platform is empty. no sign of winter. no sign of anybody. amy stop struggling, as the cops tug her arms back, handcuffing her. she hardly notices, but keep staring at the empty platform across the tracks. she glances up at the cops. panting tomislav looks down at her. then circles his finger around his ear to his comrades. they all understand.}
<C>__{tomislav }
<D>__{she's crazy.}
