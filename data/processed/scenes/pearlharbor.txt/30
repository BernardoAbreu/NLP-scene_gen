<A>__{rafe, in the middle of an aerial dogfight, throws his spitfire into a tight turn, swinging around to fire again into a squadron of messerschmidts; they outnumber the british planes, and they're tougher and faster. rafe darts through their line, machine guns blazing. one of the spitfires in rafe's squadron has taken hits in the engine compartment and is sputtering, losing power, its pilot, nigel, frantic as the german planes swarm into finish him.}
