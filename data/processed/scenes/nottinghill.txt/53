<A>__{a little later in the walk.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what's in there?}
<A>__{they are now walking by a five foot railing, with foliage behind it.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{gardens. all these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. they're like little villages.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{let's go in.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{ah no that's the point they're private villages only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you abide by rules like that?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{ahm...}
<A>__{her look makes it clear that she is waiting with interest on the answer to this.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{heck no other people do but not me i just do what i want.}
<A>__{he rattles the gate, then starts his climb but doesn't quite make it, and falls back onto the pavement...}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(casually)}
<D>__{whoopsidaisies.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{yes, you did.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{no, i didn't.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you said 'whoopsidaisies.'}
<A>__{tiny pause.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i don't think so. no one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they i mean unless they're...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{there's no 'unless.' no one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{exactly. here we go again.}
<A>__{he fails, and unfortunately, spontaneously...}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{whoopsidaisies.}
<A>__{they look at each other.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{it's a disease i've got it's a clinical thing. i'm taking pills and having injections it won't last long.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{step aside.}
<A>__{she starts to climb.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{actually be careful anna it's harder than it looks...}
<A>__{but she's already almost over.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{oh no it's not it's easy.}
<A>__{a few seconds later. anna jumps down into the garden.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{come on, flops.}
<A>__{william clambers over with terrible difficulty, dusts himself off, and heads towards where she stands.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{now seriously what in the world in this garden could make that ordeal worthwhile?}
<A>__{she leans forward and, for the firs time since the first time she kisses him. this time a proper kiss. a tiny pause.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{nice garden.}
