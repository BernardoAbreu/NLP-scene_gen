<A>__{khan closes his eyes in voluptuous satisfaction. joachim enters and khan looks at him.}
<C>__{khan}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{joachim}
<D>__{warp drive still inoperative. all other systems should be restored shortly.}
<A>__{khan sighs, contentedly.}
<C>__{khan}
<D>__{excellent. we have all the time in the world.}

<A>__{as before, saavik is on the communicator.}
<C>__{saavik}
<D>__{this is lt. saavik, calling enterprise...}
<A>__{she keeps trying. chekov stirs }
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{he's alive!}
<A>__{bones goes and tends chekov who moans, tries to sit up.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{pavel?}
<A>__{chekov tries to smile; kirk takes his hand }
<C>__{saavik}
<D>__{no use, admiral, they're still jamming all channels.}
<C>__{bones}
<P>__{(looks across chekov)}
<D>__{it wouldn't make any difference. if enterprise obeyed orders she's long since gone. and if she couldn't obey, she's finished.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{so are we, it looks like.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{i don't understand. who's responsible for all this? who is khan?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{it's a long story.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{we appear to have plenty of time.}
<C>__{bones}
<P>__{(dry)}
<D>__{you and your father can catch up on things.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(bitter)}
<D>__{my father. i hope you realize another man has just been killed because of...}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{because of you, son. you shouldn't have tried to rush someone holding a primed phaser. anyway it isn't one man dead, it's two, in case you've lost count.}
<A>__{david has been effectively spiked. long silence.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{do you have anything to eat? i don't know about anyone else, but i'm starved.}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{how can you think of food at a time like this?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{our first order of business is survival.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{there's food in the genesis cave, enough to last a lifetime should that be necessary.}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{we thought this was genesis.}
<A>__{carol laughs there's an edge of hysteria to it.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{this? it took the starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. what we did in there we did in a day. david, why don't you show dr. mccoy and the lieutenant our idea of food.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{but we can't just sit here !}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(unruffled)}
<D>__{oh, yes we can. is there really something to eat?}
<A>__{david looks at his father, who checks his watch, putting on his spectacles.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{david. please.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(to kirk)}
<D>__{this is just to give us something to do, isn't it?}
<P>__{(he shrugs)}
<D>__{come on.}
<A>__{saavik and bones make to follow. saavik turns to kirk }
<C>__{saavik}
<D>__{admiral?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{as your teacher mr. spock is fond of saying: i like to think there always are possibilities.}
