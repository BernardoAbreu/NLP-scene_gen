<P>__{(hissing)}
<D>__{where is it?}
<A>__{ainge unable to speak, gasping for air. step to his closet: shred hinges when i open it. rip the clothes rod down: nothing. pull shelves from the wall: a louisville slugger falls at my feet. i smile. ainge goes frightwig. step to him.}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{where?!}
<A>__{swing it into a wall. gaping holes in holster. bring it back like babe ruth over his head.}

<C>__{george ainge}
<D>__{nice!}
<A>__{roll to my knees: guttural groans i can't place because they're mine. junior rips a radio cord from the wall, wraps it around my neck, pulls my head back, feel his tears hit my shoulders. veins in his arms go pop. eyes in my head go pop.}

<A>__{ go black. then eyes open...out for hours days months...what? feel. hangman's bruise forming around my neck. junior and ainge gone. floorboards under ainge's bed pried up. crawl to the hole: a hiding spot, empty of whatever was in it.}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{call it: the knife was here. ainge was crawling under his bed not to escape me, but to hand it over. too hate wired to see it.}
<A>__{i check my watch: 11 pm.}
<D>__{me (v.o.) (cont'd) junior the player. junior the underestimated. junior the former evidence teacher: a murder weapon, a witness, a two hour head start.}
