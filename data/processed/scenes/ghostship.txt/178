<A>__{dodge quickly ties a loop in a coil of docking line as greer, epps, and murphy look on at the approaching buoy.}

<A>__{dodge finishes as epps ties the other end off to a cleat.}
<B>__{on the buoy}
<A>__{as it drifts along the side of the chimera. murphy drops the line down, the buoy bouncing on the swell.}

<A>__{murphy pulls the loop up as the buoy nears, aiming to hook it on its wind gauge.}
<B>__{on the buoy}
<A>__{the buoy approaches, rising and falling with the swell.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{murphy corrects.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{higher. you're gonna miss it.}
<A>__{murphy holds the loop steady.}
<B>__{on the buoy}
<A>__{the loop is too low. it's going to miss the mark as the buoy drifts toward it, when the swell drops and the buoy goes down.}

<A>__{murphy yanks on the line.}
<B>__{on the buoy}
<A>__{and the loop catches on the wind gauge.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{as the line goes taught he pulls his hands away just in time, the line snapping hard against the rail. below, the buoy heels over as it's pulled.}
<B>__{on the buoy}
<A>__{it drops with the swell, the line stretching, then swinging the giant concrete buoy float into the side of the hull with a huge booming clang.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{the line is smoking with the friction, the steel railing bowing a little with the weight as they look on.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{we're still drifting.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{the mooring hasn't come taught.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{it's not gonna hold us.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{doesn't matter.}
<B>__{on the buoy}
<A>__{as the buoy falls again with a swell and slams into the side of the ship. the water returns, lifting it high. the ship is dragging it back and it begins to rise up as its mooring comes taught. the line rises with it and soon the buoy is at a steep angle as it comes out of the water.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{the buoy is held fast between the docking line and its own mooring.}
<B>__{on the buoy}
<A>__{the buoy rises fully from the water, all three tons of it, and as it does, the wind gauge's steel mount begins to bend.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{as they watch the buoy suspended over the water between the creaking docking line and its own underwater mooring cable.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{no fucking way.}
<B>__{on the buoy}
<A>__{the gauge mount snaps and the docking line flails free, sending the buoy hurtling back into the water in a curtain of spray, whipping wildly from side to side.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{the buoy swings back and forth as it rights itself, rising on a swell, passing beyond the bow of the chimera.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{damn it.}
<A>__{they look on in silence, the buoy slowly receding as the ship drifts away.}
