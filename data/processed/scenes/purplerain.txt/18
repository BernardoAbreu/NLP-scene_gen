<A>__{as vanity watches prince leave. a profound sadness sweeps her face. suddenly susan is by her side, hugging and kissing her happily. brenda runs up, pouring champagne. morris, jerome and the time are at the end of the hallway and beckon her excitedly into the room. vanity forces a smile, goes down the hallway, casting another look at the exit door. (96) exterior back alley, the taste night morris and vanity stagger down the alley obviously very drunk. morris pulls from a flask. vanity is still in her lingerie, wears an open coat over it. her speech is slurred }

<P>__{(wails)}
<D>__{oh, no oh, god...no!}
<A>__{prince skids to a slick stop. vanity is transfixed. the entire episode took less than five seconds. he twists the throttle, blasts down upon her... she breaks in a panic! she runs clumsily down another alley, her coat flying. he whips after her like a madman. she flies around the corner a dead end! he fishtails to a slick stop }
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{get on!}

<A>__{she puts it to her lips }
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{please don't drink that. give it to me.}
<A>__{she holds the flask to her lips defiantly, then goes to drink. he lashes out suddenly, smashes it from her grip. she screams wildly, slaps him hard across the face. he stands shocked a moment, his rage surging within him, smashing through every safety valve he's acquired in his life. he backhands her savagely across the jaw. she hits the ground like a rag doll. he looks at her curiously, bends over her she sucker punches him with everything she's got! he screams in rage and grabs her hands as they flail about his face. he squeezes her fingers back while the tears stream down her cheeks and her mouth forms a silent "ow"! she bares her teeth angrily and he sucks at her mouth, biting and kissing her in a fever pitch. she kicks at him violently, hot tears streaming down her cheeks. he jams his leg between hers, rubs it firmly against her bottom. she struggles helplessly against him as he covers her breasts, her stomach, her thighs with his lips. quick breaths escape from her her breathing begins to race... he snaps her panties in two, pulls them from between her legs. she spreads herself as he releases his pants. she squeezes his buttocks, pulls him toward her but prince resists her coldly, regards her with contempt. suddenly he flips her onto her stomach, forces her to stand painfully on her knees. he rubs his hand between her buttocks, then thrusts into her painfully, driving himself to the very depths of her... ...but she stifles a cry, arches her back, and meets his thrusts fiercely, moving quicker and quicker, banging her buttocks against his thighs again and again. she's drawing from him now, turning the humiliation around, obtaining all that she needs and desires. he's powerless her thrusts set the pace. she rises, prince still inside her and tugs on him rapidly, causing him to ejaculate suddenly, drawing from him a sharp and sudden cry... she moves away, draws her coat tightly about her, fixes him with a contemptuous look }
<C>__{vanity}
<D>__{you're nothing, prince, absolutely nothing. you think you're so special but deep down you're just like all the rest.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{your whole life you've been hiding, hiding behind your music. but now you don't even have that, because last night...last night you used it to hurt someone, someone who really cares.}
<A>__{she runs up the embankment, wipes away her tears, faces him }
<C>__{vanity}
<D>__{if you put your hands on me like that ever again, i will be the last person you touch.}
<A>__{she pulls off his mother's earring, throws it at him. tears flowing, she streaks into the highway blindly, directly into the path of a speeding car }
<B>__{the driver}
<A>__{spots her in his headlights, slams on his brakes! he skids wildly across the road, comes to a screeching, burning stop inches from her thigh!}
<B>__{vanity}
<A>__{shoots a look at prince, her lips trembling, her love for him, written plainly on her face. but his eyes flash defiantly. she bites her lip sadly, then snaps a hot look at the driver }
<C>__{vanity}
<D>__{i need a ride.}
<A>__{she cuts around the car, hops in. the driver skids off into the night. prince stands there trembling, watches as it disappears into the distance.}
