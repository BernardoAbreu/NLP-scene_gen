<L>__{exterior converted town house day}
<A>__{joe and ratso peer down through a basement bay window, into the office of the perfect gentleman escort service endorsed by leading travel agencies and credit clubs offering discreet companionship and personal guided tours in any language. a large busted matron, on a french phone, fills out a memo and hands it to an immaculate young escort, who slips the memo into his topcoat pocket as he comes from the office and hails a cab. ratso darts forward, limping exaggeratedly, holding the door, lifting the memo as he brushes off the escort's topcoat. the young man waves him away with out a tip. ratso slams the door and bites his thumb after the cab, unfolding the memo as he joins joe on the sidewalk.}
