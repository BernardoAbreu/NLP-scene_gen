<L>__{interior set apt. day. b w}
<A>__{ws, the living room set. nick, wanda, the rest of the crew standing quietly. nicole glances over at cora and instantly something unspoken and unexplained passes between them. the run through begins. from the moment nicole opens her mouth it is obvious there has been a remarkable change in her. every word now has the stunning clarity of truth. cora is completely engulfed in the moment.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{dad hit me first and knocked me down. it didn't hurt that much but i started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone. he went over and started hitting danny.}
<C>__{cora}
<D>__{ellen, i have no memory of this whatsoever.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{you were just standing there looking at me.}
<A>__{as nicole continues, one by one the crew turn and watch this exquisite moment happening before them. nick's face is lit with rapture.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{roll camera... roll camera.}
<A>__{he glances over and to his horror sees that no one is behind the camera. he whispers frantically to the ac.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{where's wolf?}
<C>__{ac}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{in the bathroom... he doesn't feel good.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{get him! get him!}
<A>__{nick turns back to the scene, watching its beauty now in agony.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{then you pulled me up and said, "you're not hurt." like i was disgusting for faking, for doing the only thing i could think of to keep him from hitting me again.}
<C>__{cora}
<D>__{i was worried about danny.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{you do remember.}
<C>__{cora}
<D>__{he was smaller than you.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{you were so worried about danny. what about me, mom? why weren't you worried about me?}
<A>__{there is a heavy, stunned silence as the scene ends. nicole and cora are in each other's arms. pam and cybil share a piece of tissue. cut to: an extreme cu of nick.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{where the fuck is wolf?!!!}
