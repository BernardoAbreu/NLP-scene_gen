<D>__{this makes bennie a cut above anyone else.}
<A>__{bennie presses another button and the blades start spinning. bennie's mechanical arm is in effect now a buzz saw! the fight begins. bennie attacks quail with his buzz saw arm; quail dodges. bennie's arm shreds various articles in the cabin and keeps melina at bay with well timed swipes. finally bennie gets in a roundhouse punch to quail's jaw with his real hand. quail sprawls, dazed. now bennie goes for the kill. but melina leaps onto him. bennie grabs her by the hair and moves his spinning hand in for the quick kill. melina clutches the terrifying appendage with both hands, desperately keeping it at bay. but her strength is no match for bennie; the whirring blades are just about to bite into melina's neck when quail comes back, lands a ferocious rabbit punch to bennie's spine. quail lunges at him, grabs the blade weapon; he and bennie crash into the cabin wall and the blade rips clear through the mole's wall! alarms sound as a gaping hole is blown in the side of the cabin! all the air is sucked out by mars's external vacuum! now no one can breathe. they all claw for their masks, [still] in place. bennie is first; he recovers, lunges with his spinning arm for quail. quail barely dodges, grabs the arm, muscles it back toward bennie the spinning blades sever bennie's own oxygen line! gasp ing, he falters. quail aims a titanic blow, punches bennie out through the hole in the mole's wall! quail and melina, masks on, stare out as bennie claws desperately at his severed air line. the martian vacuum pulls the oxygen from bennie's lungs, he chokes, staggers }
