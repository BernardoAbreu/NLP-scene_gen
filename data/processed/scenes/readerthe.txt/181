<L>__{interior canteen. prison. day}
<A>__{ms brenner leads michael to the door of the canteen.}
<C>__{ms brenner}
<D>__{they're in the canteen. they're just finishing lunch.}
<A>__{michael sees an old woman who is sitting at a table. her blue dress is stretched too tight across her heavy body. her hair is grey. she has a book in her lap, but she's not reading it. a few prisoners are finishing their meal. it takes michael a moment to realise the old woman is hanna. then hanna becomes aware of being watched. she turns and looks round. at once her face lights up. michael smiles back, but as he approaches her, he fixes onto her inquiring look and sees the light go out of her eyes, as if she has looked at him and been disappointed. he sits down opposite her. she smiles, weary.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{you've grown up, kid.}
<A>__{she takes his hand. there is a long silence, michael unable to think of anything to say. he withdraws his hand.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i've got a friend who's a tailor, he makes my suits. he'll give you a job. and i've found you somewhere to live. it's a nice place. quite small but nice. i think you'll like it.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{there's a moment's silence.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{there are various social programmes, cultural stuff i can sign you up for. and there's a public library very close.}
<A>__{hanna nods slightly.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you read a lot?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{i prefer being read to.}
<A>__{there is a short silence.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{that's over now, isn't it?}
<A>__{michael doesn't answer.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{did you get married?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i did. yes i did. we have a daughter. i'm not seeing as much of her as i would like. i'd like to see a great deal more of her.}
<A>__{after a few moments, he concedes.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{the marriage didn't last.}
<A>__{there is a silence.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{have you spent a lot of time thinking about the past?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{you mean, with you?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{no. no, i didn't mean with me.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{before the trial i never thought about the past. i never had to.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{and now? what do you feel now?}
<A>__{hanna looks a moment, a haunting look, searching him.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{it doesn't matter what i think. it doesn't matter what i feel. the dead are still dead.}
<A>__{there's a silence.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i wasn't sure what you'd learnt.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{i have learnt, kid. i've learnt to read.}
<A>__{michael stares, devastated.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i will pick you up next week, ok?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{that sounds a good plan.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{good. quietly, or shall we make a big fuss?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{quietly.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{ok. quietly.}
<A>__{they look at each other. the other prisoners have already gone. they stand up. she scans his face again, searching for his thoughts. he takes her in his arms, a little awkward.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{take care, kid.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you too.}
<A>__{they walk side by side, back towards the door. then by way of saying goodbye, she takes his hand.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{see you next week.}
<A>__{she stretches her arm out before she lets go of his hand, then vanishes inside. michael walks on alone.}
