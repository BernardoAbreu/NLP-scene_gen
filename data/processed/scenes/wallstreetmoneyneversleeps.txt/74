<D>__{bretton, i have... what?... two hundred million with you.}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{and hopefully that's just a start. oleg, there are so many opportunities out there right now i feel like a kid in the candy store.}
<A>__{oleg waves him off.}
<C>__{oleg}
<D>__{you know i like to spread it around... i'm like my own fund of funds. i don't like to have too much with one manager.}
<A>__{as oleg shakes cocaine out of an envelope...}
<C>__{oleg }
<D>__{you never really know who to trust in this world.}

<A>__{and oleg regards jacob for a long moment, a jury determining the verdict... jacob holding on to that sly smile... bretton looking away... playing it cool.}
<C>__{jacob }
<D>__{it's complicated but like bretton said right now there are more opportunities than ever.}
<A>__{oleg simply nods... with a simple...}
