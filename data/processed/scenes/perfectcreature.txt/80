<A>__{liepsky hits a button and it floods edgar's cell with light. edgar is right there, staring at them, his hands plastered over the glass window. he is covered in blood. in the background a bloody corpse on the floor. edgar bangs his head against the glass, making liepsky flinch. on edgar's forehead we see scars from this kind of repeated banging.}

<D>__{we gassed him as usual. we waited 10 minutes. he must have held his breath.}
<A>__{the look on liepsky's face says it all. we see edgar. we had thought he was looking at the professor. but he's not, his gaze is focused past the professor to the dimly seen back wall of the control room. on it is a schematic, showing this room, other rooms on the level, the elevator shaft. edgar is talking it all in.}
