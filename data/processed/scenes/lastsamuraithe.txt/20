<L>__{exterior parade ground day}
<A>__{about a thousand japanese soldiers in baggy uniforms are milling around a large parade ground. each has an old single shot rifle. algren, gant, and yoshitaka look down on them from a reviewing stand.}
<C>__{gant}
<D>__{jesus....}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{ask the general what training they' ve had.}
<A>__{graham speaks to general yoshitaka, then translates his response.}
<D>__{yoshitaka graham he sa ys... we have trained them not to shoot their ...asses off.}
<A>__{algren glances to general yoshitaka, who looks back wr yl y.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{sergeant gant, have the men stand to attention.}
<C>__{gant}
<D>__{imperial army, atten tion!}
<A>__{graham translates, rather mildly.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{for god's sake, let's not keep it a secret who's in charge here ... mr. gant.}
<C>__{gant}
<P>__{(roars)}
<D>__{all right you slanty eyed little bastards stand up straight or i will shit kick every one of you cocksuckers!!}
<A>__{as the soldiers immediately stand to attention, we begin a montage of the training of the first imperial army: we see gant drilling the men. shouting at his translator. trying to get them to march in formation. algren is nearby, watching.}
<C>__{algren }
<D>__{august 4,1876. as i watch this new army train, i cannot help but think of those who rode with me in me 23rd cavalry.}
<A>__{algren sits in his tent, writing in his journal. outside, the japanese are being taught the basics of firing tactics.}
<C>__{algren }
<D>__{for four years they had survived, never once shrinking from the fire. and so, when given my order to charge the advancing rebel infantry, they never hesitated. ...and they all died.}
<A>__{we see algren showing the japanese how to fire in formation. the old single shot rifles they carry make reloading a painfully slow process.}
<C>__{algren }
<D>__{now i am training another army. in another civil war.}
<A>__{algren and gant spar with sabers algren's expertise far exceeds gant's, a fact which gant accepts with good humor.}
<C>__{algren }
<D>__{is this why i was spared? once again to lead men to their death?}
<A>__{it is sunset algren, graham, and general yoshitaka watch the training. general yoshitaka speaks.}
<D>__{yoshltaka graham ... the problem is they're peasants. they have never had this sort of responsibility or power.}
<A>__{algren watches gant march beside the japanese. they are illuminated by the majestic red sunset}
<C>__{algren}
<P>__{(to graham)}
<D>__{ask him if they have a flag.}
<A>__{graham translates. genera1 yoshitaka responds.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{no flag.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{they need a flag.}
