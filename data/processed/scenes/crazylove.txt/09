<L>__{interior restaurant night}
<A>__{tuxedoed waiters glide through the tony restaurant, where the patrons dare speak only in hushed tones. letty sits sipping wine with her mother, mrs. martha mayer, immaculate in a cream suit, young looking for her 50 odd years. letty's sister ruth early 20s and pretty, with flyaway hair and an ever present smile bounds into the restaurant, oozing happiness. letty discretely waves her over.}

<D>__{sorry i'm late.}
<A>__{letty pours her a glass of wine.}
<C>__{mrs. mayer}
<D>__{letty was just getting ready to tell me her good news.}

<D>__{tell, tell.}
<C>__{mrs. mayer}
<P>__{(leaning toward letty)}
<D>__{letty, dear, is that a cat hair on your blouse?}
<A>__{letty removes the nasty hair from her blouse.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{so, i got the district to approve my after school math program.}
<A>__{ruth smiles at her, but vacantly.}
<C>__{mrs. mayer}
<D>__{how wonderful, darling.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what does that mean for you?}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{i will be running it three days a week, and...}
<C>__{mrs. mayer}
<D>__{will you get time off to do that?}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.}
<A>__{ruth stares around the restaurant, a shit eating grin plastered across her face.}
<C>__{letty}
<P>__{(to ruth)}
<D>__{what's up with you?}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{me? nothing. tell me more about the job.}
<C>__{mrs. mayer}
<P>__{(to ruth)}
<D>__{not a job, a promotion.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{no, mom, it's more of a prestige thing.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{mmmmmmm.}
<A>__{letty passes her hand in front of ruth's eyes.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{ruth. calling ruth.}

<C>__{letty}
<D>__{come on.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{no, really. tell me about the promotion.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{well, my theory is that people can really enjoy math, but they lose interest...}
<A>__{ruth can't hold it a moment longer without bursting.}
<C>__{ruth}
<P>__{(almost screaming)}
<D>__{i'm getting married.}
<A>__{mrs. mayer's eyes immediately fill with tears. ruth leaps up and hugs her mother. other diners glance toward the table. one woman in the restaurant taps the side of her glass with her fork and raises a silent toast to ruth. other diners follow suit. ruth grins back and starts to giggle.}
<C>__{mrs. mayer}
<D>__{i'm so happy for you. it's just wonderful.}
<A>__{mrs. mayer dabs her eyes with her napkin.}
<C>__{mrs. mayer}
<D>__{my goodness. a wedding. my goodness.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{wow. congratulations.}
<A>__{ruth dashes around the table to embrace the stunned letty.}
<C>__{ruth}
<P>__{(to letty)}
<D>__{can you believe it?}
<A>__{ruth sits back down and pulls a gorgeous ring from her purse. she slips it on and wiggles her finger in front of letty and her mother, who peers at it with approval.}
<C>__{mrs. mayer}
<D>__{tell us every detail.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{you've only known jake a few months.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{three and a week.}
