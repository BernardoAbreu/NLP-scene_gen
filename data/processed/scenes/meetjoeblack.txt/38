<L>__{exterior 5th avenue, new york city day}
<A>__{parrish and joe striding downtown, joe's jacket fits per fectly, he blends right in and he clearly enjoys being part of the smart fifth avenue crowd on the way to work. parrish senses joe's pleasure, his slight preening, his eyes check ing out the good looking women headed for the offices at the top of corporate high rises.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{you know, i got to thinking last night with you here, and seem ingly occupied, how's your work going uh elsewhere?}
<A>__{a flicker from joe. he has heard what parrish has said, his eyes busy with the grift and the sparkle of the avenue, but he is concentrating on parrish's words.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{when you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i guess so.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{so you understand the concept then. when you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{so you've grasped the idea. con gratulations. now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you still will have barely a glimpse of what i am talking about.}
<A>__{parrish falls silent, chewing over joe's admonition.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{joe ?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yes, bill.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{how about giving a guy a break?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{make an exception?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{there's one to every rule.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{not this.}
<A>__{they stride on, cutting through the crowd, joe all at home in his new surrounding, but parrish just the opposite, un characteristically uncomfortable, phrases forming on his lips but unspoken, then suddenly he blurts out:}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{ i don't deserve this. i'm still young, this is not my time }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{that's what everybody says.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i'm not everybody.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{that's what everybody says.}
<A>__{parrish is trying to control himself, glances at joe.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i want to live.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i understand.}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{but you can't.}
<A>__{a sudden silence between them. parrish's shoulders appear to have stopped slightly, the courage he displayed at rais ing these issues has vanished.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{what's it like?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{what's it like where i'm going?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{can you keep a secret?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{so can i.}
<A>__{they turn into parrish's office building.}
