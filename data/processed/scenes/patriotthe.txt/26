<L>__{exterior field pond bluff day}
<A>__{marion plows a field. nathan leads the plowhorse. samuel follows, breaking up the clods of dirt. hard work. they stop to catch their breath. a soft wind blows. marion turns his head as if listening for a faint voice. he hears nothing. he snaps the reins and continues plowing.}
<L>__{interior marion's attic late afternoon}
<A>__{dark. thomas steps up into the attic. he finds a trunk and opens it. lifting out some blankets, he uncovers a trove of marion's old military gear a worn battle coat, a box of medals, a military sword, rusted into its scabbard. thomas puts on the coat, which hangs off his narrow shoulders. he stands in front of a dusty mirror, appraising himself, then stops as he hears footsteps coming up the stairs. it's marion, tired and dirty from his plowing. thomas grimaces, expecting him to be angry, but sees him shake his head gently.}

<A>__{thomas considers it, then nods.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{alright. seventeen.}
<A>__{marion offers his hand. they shake firmly, like adults. marion takes the coat off thomas and puts it back in the trunk. they walk down the stairs together.}
