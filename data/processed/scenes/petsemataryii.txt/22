<A>__{tiger sees the front door ajar. and as she approaches to explore what lies beyond the door swings open... zowie, a siberian husky is staring back at her. he's black and white with blue eyes, with a mask that is at once menacing and majestic. a pudgy thirteen year old boy, drew, has a hold of the dog's collar. zowie's bark sends tiger scrambling. drew loses his grip as zowie yanks free. a strong, paternal command calls after drew from outside.}
