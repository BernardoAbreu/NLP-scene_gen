<L>__{interior hall of the northwest coast indians night}
<A>__{pendergast and margo run down the long dark room, passing an enormous hollowed out canoe. as they exit the far end, the dark shape of mbwun emerges. it leaps forward, closing in fast.}
<L>__{interior hall of the asian peoples night}
<A>__{margo and pendergast enter a series of maze like room with hidden corners, nooks and crannies with cases full of esoteric buddhist and japanese art. they're running through the twists and turns as fast as they can.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{we're not going to make the storage room!}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{listen to me, pendergast. mbwun's dna is part homo sapien. in primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain! if you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it. shoot it in the eye!}
<A>__{at this they round a corner and mbwun leaps out! it circled ahead and was waiting in front of them! the animal swipes at margo and pendergast. the force of the monster's blow sends margo reeling and slams pendergast into the wall. he falls, crumples and drops his gun! the case beside him shatters spewing relics, as mbwun pushes past. pendergast groans and gets to his knees with difficulty. margo is frantically crawling away in the dark! the beast makes a low sound of pleasure and reaches out one claw, easily pins her down. pendergast looks frantically for any kind of weapon! on margo now pinned beneath the heaving body of the monster! powerless, she looks up into the horrible face of death as mbwun raises an enormous claw! pendergast, desperate, cries out }
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{please, no! don't hurt margo!}
<A>__{oddly enough, the beast pauses for once. talking to the damn thing is the one tactic no one has tried! the claw halts in mid air. the beast blinks once and looks from pendergast to margo. margo sees a flash of something unexpectedly human in its eyes! in astonishment, she whispers...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{my god. you understand.}
<A>__{as they stare, amazed, imperceptibly, the beast appears to narrow its eyes in response! margo controls her voice, keeps it even.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{please let me go. we won't hurt you.}
<A>__{a strange noise comes out of the monster. a low, confused growl. he doesn't loosen his grip on margo, but he leans down to look at her closer with one green, unblinking eye. she struggles not to turn away in revulsion. his enormous jaws are right near her throat. everything is very still. and then... a barrage of fire breaks out! the s.w.a.t. team is in the doorway, laying down everything they've got. the creature roars as if betrayed, leaves margo and leaps up. it barrels down on the s.w.a.t. team, picks up jennings and spikes him to the ground. jennings hits the floor with his neck at a crazy angle. it snaps like a twig. the other men drop back. mbwun follows, tearing through the men, cutting a deathly swath! pendergast moves to help the s.w.a.t. team. margo struggles to her feet and her hand touches the wall. beside her is a fire hose in a cabinet! in a split second margo hauls it out, throws a switch and gets a blast of water. she turns it on the beast as it grabs for pendergast. the force of the water is enormous. it pushes the monster out the end of the hall. pendergast runs towards her, takes the hose and holds it.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{run!}
<A>__{she takes off blindly in the maze like room. from somewhere behind her she hears a horrible howl. on margo... as she twists and turns through the rows of display cases, tearing blindly in the dark. ahead is a door. she dives through it and finds she's in...}
