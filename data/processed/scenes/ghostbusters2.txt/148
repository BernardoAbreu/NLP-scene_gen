<L>__{interior museum restoration studio night (same time)}
<A>__{moonlight streams through the skylight above, bathing the studio in eerie white light. oscar is lying safely on a table in front of the painting of vigo. dana enters cautiously and sees the baby. seeing no one else about, she quickly sneaks down to the table and picks up the baby, hugging hin tight, greatly relieved to find him unharmed and intact.}
<C>__{janosz }
<D>__{i knew you would come.}
<A>__{startled, dana turns at the sound of his voice as janosz steps out from behind the vigo painting.}
<C>__{dana}
<P>__{(defiantly)}
<D>__{what do you want with my baby?}
<C>__{janosz}
<D>__{no harm will come to the child. you might even say it's a privilege. he will be the vessel for the spirit of vigo. and you well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world. doesn't that sound nice?}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{if this is what the world will be like, i don't want to live in it.}
<C>__{janosz}
<P>__{(confidentially, indicating vigo)}
<D>__{i don't believe we have the luxury of choice.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{everybody has a choice.}
<C>__{janosz}
<D>__{not in this case, my dear. take a look. that's not gainsborough's blue boy up there. he's vigo!}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{i don't care who he is. he's not taking my baby.}
<A>__{dana walks quickly to the door but suddenly oscar flies out of her arms, floats across the room and lands lightly back in the cradle.}
<B>__{dana}
<A>__{she turns and looks at vigo, for the first time feeling his power.}
<C>__{janosz}
<D>__{you will see. it's all for the best.}
