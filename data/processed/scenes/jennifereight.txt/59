<L>__{59: exterior car park at beach. dusk.}
<A>__{darkness in about an hour. wide over the car park. sand dunes surround it. practically deserted of cars. headlights snap on focusing attention on a station wagon exchange of good byes.}
<C>__{helena }
<D>__{i really liked margie ..}
<A>__{silhouettes with exaggerated shadows walk across the car park.}
<D>__{what does she do?}
<C>__{berlin }
<D>__{she runs a kind of hair dress ing and you know, beauty salon ..}
<C>__{helena }
<D>__{have you known her long?}
<C>__{berlin }
<D>__{i was married to her sister ..}
<A>__{the angle changes and is closer now. helena has taken his arm.}
<D>__{you don't ask what i'm like?}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{i know what you're like ..}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{how d'you know what i'm like?}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{ross told me.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{really? what did he say?}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{he said you're quite chubby. and you have a nervous tick.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{he said that? what else did he say?}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{just your age.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{which is what?}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{fifty seven .. i don't mind ..}
<A>__{berlin is more amused than annoyed. they arrive at the car and his suggestion is met with an appropriate response from helena.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{you wanna drive? c'mon we're in a car park, miles from any where .. there's nothing arou nd but nothing and sand dunes ..}
<A>__{"i can't drive a car." doesn't like cars. but he's not hearing.}
<D>__{c'mon it'll be fun. you can drive me around in circles ..}
<A>__{no lady ever had a driving lesson like this before. berlin all but sits in her seat. arm on the back of it. hand on the wheel. for a split second they're doing 60. now they're doing about 4. the mercedes spirals in widening circles. instructions and enc ouragement from berlin .. ok. .. straight now .. the mercedes straightens and heads through the dunes. "it's a big car park?"}
<D>__{we're going along a little track.}
<A>__{helena may like driving but she doesn't like the sound of that.}
<D>__{it's ok. it's not a public road.}
<A>__{headlights behind them approach quickly. disappear and reappear as they follow the geography of the dunes. berlin only now bec omes aware of them. one more dip and they slam in. her anxiety is misinterpreted. he takes the wheel. no problem. let him pass. the vehicle is right up behind them. as it overtakes helena is scared. and still scared even though berlin has stopped the car.}
<D>__{it's alright, i'm sorry. it was my fault, it wasn't a good idea.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{that was the "hollow car," john.}
<A>__{just time to see tail lights of a van disappearing in the gloom.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{a volkswagen van? are you sure?}
