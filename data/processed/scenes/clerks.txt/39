<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{int: convenience store. day}
<A>__{a note on the counter next to a small pile of money reads:}
<B>__{please leave money on the counter. take change when applicable. be honest.}
<A>__{dante and veronica are slumped on the floor, behind the counter. veronica holds dante in her arms, his head on her chest. change is heard hitting the counter.}
<C>__{dante}
<P>__{(to o.c. customer)}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{the door is heard opening and closing a customer leaving.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{how much money did you leave up there?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. people only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{you're trusting.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{why do you say that?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{how do you know they're taking the right amount of change? or even paying for what they take?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{honesty through paranoia. why do you smell like shoe polish?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i had to use shoe polish to make that sign. the smell won't come off.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{do you think anyone can see us down here?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{why? you wanna have sex or something?}
<C>__{veronica}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{ooh! can we?!}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{i was kidding.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{yeah, right. you can't get enough of me.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{typically male point of view.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{how do you figure?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{you show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. what about what we do for you?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{women? women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{"be there?"}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{how flattering.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{now, making a woman cum...therein lies a challenge.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{oh, you think so?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{a girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. a guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{and i actually date you?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{something wrong?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{i'm insulted. believe me, don juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. just "being there" as you put it is not enough.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i touched a nerve.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{i'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{it wasn't directed at you. i was making a broad generalization.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{you were making a generalization about "broads!"}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{these are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{how many?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{how many what?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{how many girls have you slept with?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{how many different girls? didn't we already have this discussion once?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{we might have; i don't remember. how many?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{including you?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{it better be up to and including me.}
<C>__{dante}
<P>__{(pause to count)}
<D>__{twelve.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{you've slept with twelve different girls?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{including you; yes.}
<A>__{pause. she slaps him.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{what the hell was that for?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{you're a pig.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{why'd you hit me?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{do you know how many different men i've had sex with?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{do i get to hit you after you tell me?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{three.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{three?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{three including you.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{you've only had sex with three different people?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{i'm not the pig you are.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{you!}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{no; who were the three, besides me?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{john franson and rob stanslyk.}
<C>__{dante}
<P>__{(with true admiration)}
<D>__{wow. that's great. that's something to be proud of.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{i am. and that's why you should feel like a pig. you men make me sick. you'll sleep with anything that says yes.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{animal, vegetable, or mineral.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{vegetable meaning paraplegic.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{they put up the least amount of struggle.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{after dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. big.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{all right. name it.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{i want you to come with me on monday.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{to school. there's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{it's important to me, dante. you have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. i wish you'd go back to school.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{jesus, would you stop? you make my head hurt when you talk about this.}
<A>__{veronica stands, letting dante's head hit the floor.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{shit! why are we getting up?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{unlike you, i have a class in forty five minutes.}
<A>__{a handsome young man (willam) is standing at the counter. veronica reacts to him.}
<C>__{veronica}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{willam!}
<C>__{willam}
<D>__{ronnie! how are you? you work here now?}
<C>__{veronica}
<P>__{(locks arms with dante)}
<D>__{no, i'm just visiting my man.}
<P>__{(to dante)}
<D>__{dante, this is willam black.}
<P>__{(to willam)}
<D>__{this is dante hicks, my boyfriend.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{how are you? just the soda?}
<C>__{willam}
<D>__{and a pack of cigarettes.}
<P>__{(to veronica; paying)}
<D>__{are you still going to seton hall?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{no, i transferred into monmouth this year. i was tired of missing him.}
<P>__{(squeezes dante's arm)}
<C>__{willam}
<D>__{do you still talk to sylvan?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{i just talked to her on monday. we still hang out on weekends.}
<C>__{willam}
<P>__{(leaving)}
<D>__{that's cool. well you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{i will. take it easy.}
<C>__{willam}
<D>__{bye.}
<P>__{(exits)}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{bye}
<P>__{(to dante)}
<D>__{that was snowball.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{why do you call him that?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{sylvan made it up. it's a blow job thing.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{after he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. it's called snowballing.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{he requested this?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{he gets off on it.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{sylvan can be talked into anything.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{why do you say that?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{like you said she snowballed him.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{sylvan? no; i snowballed him.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{yeah, right.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{i'm serious...}
<A>__{a moment of silence as dante's chuckles fade to comprehension.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{you sucked that guy's dick?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{yeah. how do you think i know he liked...}
<C>__{dante}
<P>__{(panicky)}
<D>__{but...but you said you only had sex with three guys! you never mentioned him!}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{that's because i never had sex with him!}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{you sucked his dick!}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{we went out a few times. we didn't have sex, but we fooled around.}
<C>__{dante}
<P>__{(massive panic attack)}
<D>__{oh my god! why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{because i did only sleep with three guys! that doesn't mean i didn't just go with people.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{oh my god i feel so nauseous...}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{i'm sorry, dante. i thought you understood.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i did understand! i understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{please calm down.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{how many?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{dante...}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{how many dicks have you sucked?!}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{let it go...}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{how many?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{all right! shut up a second and i will tell you! jesus! i didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{this is different. this is important. how many?!}
<A>__{she counts silently, using fingers as marks. dante waits on a customer in the interim. veronica stops counting.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{well...?}
<C>__{veronica}
<P>__{(half mumbled)}
<D>__{something like thirty six.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{what? something like thirty six?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{lower your voice!}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{what the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty six?" does that include me?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{um. thirty seven.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i'm thirty seven?}
<C>__{veronica}
<P>__{(walking away)}
<D>__{i'm going to class.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{thirty seven?!}
<P>__{(to customer)}
<D>__{my girlfriend sucked thirty seven dicks!}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{in a row?}
<A>__{dante chases veronica down and grabs her by the door.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{hey! where are you going?!}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{hey listen, jerk! until today you never even knew how many guys i'd slept with, because you never even asked. and then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls. well, i never had sex with twelve different guys!}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{no, but you sucked enough dick!}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{yeah, i went down on a few guys...}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{a few?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{...and one of those guys was you! the last one, i might add, which if you're too stupid to comprehend means that i've been faithful to you since we met! all the other guys i went with before i met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead! but don't look at me like i'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me!}
<C>__{dante}
<P>__{(a bit more rational)}
<D>__{well...why did you have to suck their dicks? why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{because going down it's a big deal! i used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later i'd go down on him. but i only had sex with the guys i loved.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i feel sick.}
<C>__{veronica}
<P>__{(holds him)}
<D>__{i love you. don't feel sick.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{every time i kiss you now i'm going to taste thirty six other guys.}
<A>__{veronica violently lets go of him.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{i'm going to school. maybe later you'll be a bit more rational.}
<C>__{dante}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{thirty seven. i just can't...}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{goodbye, dante.}
<A>__{she exits in a huff. dante stands there in silence for a moment. then he swings the door open and yells out.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{try not to suck any more dicks on your way through the parking lot!}
<A>__{two men who were walking in the opposite direction outside double back and head in the direction. veronica went.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{hey! hey, you! get back here!}
