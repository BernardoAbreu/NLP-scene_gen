<A>__{sam, stands in the corner of a large, walk in closet, watching as molly goes through his effects. boxes, scattered underfoot, are filling up with his life's possessions. molly reaches for a shirt.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{wait, moll. not that one. that's my favorite...}
<A>__{she tosses it into a box and then takes down a sweater. it is obviously handmade, about four sizes too big. sam recognizes it. molly holds the sweater tenderly and presses it to her cheek. after a moment she puts it back. then, in a surprising outburst, she cries out and begins flailing at the shelves. everything comes flying off. sam reaches out to console her.}
