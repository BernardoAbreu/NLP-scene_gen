<A>__{close on: jack stirring, immediately hearing the scuttle of insects. he rolls over and see's huge spiders crawling into the pit. he staggers to his feet ... reaching into his pack and pulls from it a flare. throwing it at the spiders they crawl off. denham is lying nearby.}

<A>__{denham stirs, mumbling in pain but alive.}
<B>__{jack sees jimmy.}
<A>__{close on: jimmy is looking vacantly into space, jack kneels down.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{jimmy?}
<A>__{close on: jimmy looks up at jack, there are tears filling his eyes. he falls into jack's arms softly sobbing. angle on: denham sitting up... dawning realization in his eyes. lumpy, his back to choy ... he holds choy's hand ... but choy's fingers slide limply out of lumpy's hand ... lumpy turns to choy .. only to see that he has died. ngle on: hayes' eyes closed, his face peaceful, lying dead on the floor of the ravine. angle on: denham peering over a rock. the wreckage of the camera lies smashed and broken on the chasm floor ... a thin, shiny, thread of black film trailing from the smashed camera body like spilt innards. denham reaches out and touches the exposed film ... his dreams}
<B>__{destroyed.}
<A>__{wide on: the flare slowly dies. close on: jack cradling jimmy in his arms. he looks up as he sees the insects crawl back. angle on: a huge six foot carnivorous maggot thing squirms out! it crawls blindly towards lumpy and choy! angle on: lumpy pulling choy's body to safety, but both are attacked by large insects, the size of dogs! jack tries to pull the giant crab spider off lumpy, but instead it turns on him! more giant crab spiders jump at jack. lumpy and choy are consumed by the nightmarish bugs. angle on: denham is wielding a short stick like a club ... he smashes the huge bugs in a psychotic explosion of rage, pulverizing their bodies into the dirt! all around, monstrosities of nature emerge from dank burrows and crawl towards the jack, denham and jimmy ... these are huge insectile mutants combinations of spiders, crabs, mantises and centipedes! suddenly jimmy notices the tommy gun sticking out of jack's pack. grabbing it he aims at the insects on jack. bam! bam! bam! the giant insects are blown apart! jack looks wildly around for denham. they see that they're surrounded by spiders. angle on: jack desperately swings at the insects with a stick, whacking and stabbing them. bam! bam! bam! gunshots ring out. spiders swarm out of holes in the cliff and die. jack spins around ... confused. angle on: englehorn and a couple of sailors open fire from the lip of the chasm, shooting the spiders into smithereens! angle on: bruce swings down from above, clinging to a vine ... gun blazing! bruce proceeds to lay waste to the insects ... those not blasted apart, scurrying away, back in to the darkness.}
