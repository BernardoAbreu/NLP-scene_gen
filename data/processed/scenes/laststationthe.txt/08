<L>__{interior moscow. study. day.}
<A>__{a handsome study in the moscow townhouse of vladimir grigorevich chertkov, tolstoy's most articulate and dedicated disciple. he's interviewing tolstoy's newly appointed secretary, valentin bulgakov, the young man we met near the train, who, at the mention of sex, blushes a little.}
<C>__{chertkov}
<D>__{but sex... you are twenty three. not an easy age for abstinence, is it?}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{tolstoy does not approve of sexual relations. i know this.}
<C>__{chertkov}
<D>__{he despises them, in fact...}
<A>__{chertkov reaches for a small tin of moustache wax.}
<C>__{chertkov}
<D>__{i don't want to belabor the point, but i arranged for a manservant last year who proceeded to ruin two housemaids just like that. he was very upset.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{this would not be a problem. i'm celibate. i'm also a strict vegetarian.}
<A>__{chertkov nods his approval, begins to worry his moustache.}
<C>__{chertkov}
<D>__{yes, i've heard many good things about you. i've even read what you`ve written. so has he.}
<A>__{valentin's face flushes with pride. chertkov steals a glance at his reflection in the glass bookcase. one side of his moustache droops a little. he tugs awkwardly at it.}
<C>__{chertkov}
<D>__{my dear boy, if you were to become tolstoy's private secretary, you would be given a great gift. you'll be with him every day, eat together, walk in the forest by his side.}
<A>__{it's difficult to contain himself.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{believe me, since becoming a tolstoyan, i have become so eager}
<D>__{discussing ideas, improving my very soul.}
<C>__{chertkov}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{well, we have a lot to do if we are to get his work to the people.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{we?}
<A>__{they both laugh.}
<C>__{chertkov}
<D>__{yes, we. if we can encourage the spread of passive resistance...just think of it valentin thousands of ordinary russians casting off centuries of spiritual and political oppression }
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{in the name of truth and freedom.}
<C>__{chertkov}
<D>__{truth and freedom, yes but still, my boy, there are so many enemies }
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{enemies?}
<A>__{chertkov walks to the window, signals valentin to follow him. he points to two men in plainclothes standing in the street below.}
<C>__{chertkov}
<D>__{the czar's police...you'll be followed when you leave here...and the church will stop at nothing to bring him back into the fold. his children can't be trusted... only sasha... and then of course there is the countess...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{well, one doesn't like to come between married people whatever the circumstances, but her dogged attachment to private property, her public criticism of our movement...}
<C>__{chertkov }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the point is, he needs a man of your intellectual gifts around him. someone who can help him with the new work. someone who understands his goals.}
<A>__{chertkov returns to the desk.}
<C>__{chertkov}
<D>__{and although they've allowed me to return to russia, i can't see him. they keep me under house arrest... they might as well keep me in a cage.}
<A>__{clearly upset, chertkov pauses to get control of himself. he picks up a package, hands it to valentin.}
<C>__{chertkov}
<D>__{so, i need you to put these letters directly into his hands. one can't be sure what gets through to him.}
<A>__{valentin looks at him, quizzical.}
<C>__{chertkov}
<D>__{sofya andreyevna does not respect his privacy.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{she wouldn't open his private correspondence...}
<A>__{chertkov raises an eyebrow. an ominous silence.}
<C>__{chertkov}
<D>__{i have another task for you, my dear.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{please.}
<C>__{chertkov}
<D>__{you'll keep a diary for me.}
<A>__{he hands valentin a notebook.}
<C>__{chertkov}
<D>__{i need to know everything that goes on at yasnaya polyana. let me know who visits the house, any talk of the copyright to his work, any contact with the church, what letters come and go.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{anything sofya andreyevna says.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{anything?}
<C>__{chertkov}
<D>__{she's very, very dangerous.}
