<L>__{interior watson's bedroom day}
<A>__{there are two open valises on the bed. watson is moving around the room, collecting various odds and ends, while mrs. hudson packs his clothes.}
<C>__{mrs. hudson}
<D>__{it's so sad. you and mr. holmes after all these years }
<P>__{(she sobs)}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{please, mrs. hudson none of that.}
<A>__{mrs. hudson takes a clean handkerchief from the open valise, blows her nose.}
<C>__{mrs. hudson}
<D>__{i will wash this and send it on to you.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{i will be at brown's hotel.}
<C>__{mrs. hudson}
<P>__{(still sniffling)}
<D>__{i know how it feels i once went through a divorce myself.}
<C>__{watson}
<P>__{(removing diploma from wall)}
<D>__{actually, i'm rather looking forward to it. leading a normal life again. regular office hours nine to three and if occasionally there's an emergency call in the middle of the night, i know it's going be appendicitis and not an ax murder. let holmes go mucking about in the fog and the sleet, looking for a bloodstained collar button out on the moors, with some demented hound snapping at his behind }
<A>__{from the living room comes the sound of a revolver shot. mrs. hudson screams and watson looks off in alarm. then he races out of the room, diploma in hand, followed by mrs. hudson.}
