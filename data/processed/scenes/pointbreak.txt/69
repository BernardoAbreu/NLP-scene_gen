<A>__{long lens pov of razorheads house. through the windows we see the four moving inside. tone throws archbold and bunker a coors from the fridge. archbold shakes his and opens it in warchild's face. warchild, in no mood, slams him against the wall. we feel the revved up, chaotic energy of the group in silent pantomime. bunker is met by a girl coming from the back of the house. she is wearing only panties and a black leather vest. short black hair and tattoos stark on her white skin. bunker puts one arm around her neck in a head lock embrace and slides his other hand under her vest. tone pulls the curtains.}
