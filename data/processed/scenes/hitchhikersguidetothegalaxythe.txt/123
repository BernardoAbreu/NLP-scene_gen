<A>__{two missiles screech overhead and soar up toward... the vogon ships descending from space. the missiles each hit a ship. they explode. two more missiles fire, taking out two more ships. but several ships do land. marvin watches from within the stonehenge formation.}

<D>__{life. loathe it or ignore it, you can't like it.}

<L>__{interior corridor temple of deep thought day}
<B>__{close on zaphod}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{...and you're right, i shouldn't be so upset 'cause life goes on and i should just go on with it, right?}
<A>__{pull back to reveal ford is hesitantly aiming the gun at zaphod.}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{shoot him again.}
<A>__{ford reluctantly pulls the trigger. click.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{hitchhiking is good. towels are good, too.}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{brilliant.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{yeah. i kinda like this.}
<A>__{she take the gun from him.}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{a gun that makes people suddenly see things from your point of view. useful tool for the deranged evangelist trying to convert the masses, eh?}
<A>__{she starts walking.}
<C>__{trillian }
<D>__{we should get back. arthur's waiting.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{who cares?}
<C>__{trillian}
<P>__{(spinning on him; pointed)}
<D>__{i do especially since we're both somewhat of an endangered species now.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{why so edgy?}
<A>__{she can't believe he's asking this. she aims the gun, click!}
<C>__{zaphod }
<D>__{of course you're edgy, your planet's been blown up and you've been tooling around the galaxy with the guy who signed the order}
<A>__{click. she shoots him again.}
<C>__{zaphod }
<D>__{you actually wanted to know the question because you always thought there was more to life, and now you're crushed because you find out there really isn't.}
<A>__{she's getting angrier and more hurt. click.}
<C>__{zaphod }
<D>__{you've got no home, no family, no one to be with and you're stuck with me, another in a long line of men who doesn't appreciate you because he's too busy appreciating himself.}
<A>__{hearing this puts a lump in her throat, causes her eyes to well with tears. she lowers the gun. zaphod shakes his head the effect wearing off. but he realizes what he said and doesn't like it.}
<C>__{zaphod }
<D>__{give me that thing.}
<A>__{he grabs the gun, points it at her.}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{won't affect me. i'm already a woman.}
<A>__{before he can react, a bright light shines behind them. they turn, shielding their eyes.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{uh oh oh. it's okay, it's only a couple of...}
<A>__{flash! keeeooow! they are engulfed in white light.}
