<A>__{chris doesn't hear the trooper. behind him, a decomposed hand pokes out of a drainage ditch beneath the carpet. it gropes. finds purchase on the floor. chris is unaware of the danger. he hurls himself against the door. he can't break through. the thing that climbs out of the ditch was once a man, once a scientist. it's wearing a lab coat and a pair of thick eyeglasses. but it's long dead. it's... a zombie. as it pulls itself up, its eyeglasses strike the side of the ditch. they fall, clattering, the rims scraping the zombie's cheek, which peels away like onion skin. chris hears the noise. turns and sees... ...the dead man, reaching out hungrily. chris is trapped. he aims his winchester. click! he forgot. it's empty. the zombie pulls itself fully up onto the floor. chris digs in his shoulder bag. pulls out a handful of bullets and with them, accidentally, jill's beret. rising emotion stops him for a moment. the dead man crawls toward him. chris might not have time to load. as he tries to jam a bullet into his rifle, the zombie swats at him. catches the beret. looks at it. sniffs it. the bullet pops out of chris' nervous fingers. he tries to load another.}
