<L>__{91: interior bedroom. house. night.}
<A>__{moonlight through the windows. they are silhouettes. they want to embrace but in a situation like this a bedroom is the worst place to be. no sound except the music. and what's anyone supp osed to say? this atmosphere is about kissing and nothing more. christ hear this music. a sweet pulse of puccini. big close of lips meeting in moonlight. now in each other's arms. they kiss. and then they're kissing. and nothing else is happening in the whole fucking universe except a telephone just started to ring. still ringing. still kissing. somebody has got to give in. the phone finally gets answered. the voice at the end isn't expect ed. but berlin sounds pleased to hear it. it seems one problem got solved. "i gotta tell you, margie. you are mrs santa claus."}
