<L>__{interior mr. arkady's office day}
<A>__{it is the kind of cheesy, temporary office one would expect to find in a las vegas apartment building overlooking the downtown strip. mr. arkady, dressed in a silk suit with conspicuous jewelry, sits behind his desk eating lunch and cleaning his nails. sergei, his goon in a shiny polyester shirt, hovers over his boss helping feed and manicure him. these are the two men from bobby's earlier flashback. they are dangerous in an endearing way. sergei answers the phone. in the background is a very voluptuous female, obviously from the middle east. sofia.}
