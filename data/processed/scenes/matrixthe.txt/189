<A>__{gun report thunders through the underground, both men blasting, moving at impossible speed. for a blinking noment we enter bullet time. gun flash tongues curl from neols gun, bullets float forward like a plane noving across the sky, cartridges cartwheel into space. an instant later they are nearly on top of each other, rolling up out of a move that is almost a mirrored reflection of the other each jamming their gun tight to the other's head. they freeze in a kind of embrace; neo sweating, panting, agent smith machine calm. agent smith smiles.}

<C>__{neo}
<D>__{so are you.}
<A>__{the smile falls. agent smith yanks his trigger.}
<B>__{click.}
<A>__{agent smith's face warps with rage and he attacks, fist flying at furious speed, blows and counters, neo retreating as a knife hand opens his forearm, and a kick sends him slamming back against a steel column. stunned, he ducks just under a punch that crunches into the beam, steel chunks exploding like shrapnel. behind him, neo leaps into the air, delivering a neck snapping reverse round house. agent smith's glasses fly off and he glares at neo; his eyes, ice blue.}

<D>__{you can't win.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{i already have.}
<A>__{he attacks with a vicious series of blows but the agent seems to absorb them, waiting for his opening. and this time agent smith's attack is too much, an unrelenting fury, fists pounding like jackhammers.}
