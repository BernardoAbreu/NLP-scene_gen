<L>__{interior family room night}
<A>__{it has grown very dark in the family room. frank is sitting all alone, perfectly still, in one of the over stuffed chairs, the vodka bottle on a table next to him. he stares off into space. a small voice comes out of the darkness.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{you okay, frank?}
<A>__{frank acknowledges fletcher's small presence standing to the side of the big chair. he doesn't look at him directly.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yeah, fletcher, i'm okay. how 'bout you?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{i couldn't sleep... it was so scary, just thinking about it...}
<A>__{he looks at frank.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{do you feel scared, frank?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yeah, fletcher, i do.}
<A>__{frank puts his hand gently on fletcher's head, but he does not look at him.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{everybody's afraid of something, flethcer. that's how we know we care about something, when we're afraid we'll lose it.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{what are you afraid of?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i think you should try to go back to sleep now, pal.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{tell me, frank, please. is it the man who killed nicki? are you afraid of him?}
<A>__{finally, frank turns and looks at fletcher. frank is pretty far gone. he shakes his head "no." he realizes that that kind of fear had never occurred to him, and recognizing that fact sets him back into his thoughts.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{then what? what are you afraid of?}
<A>__{frank doesn't have the will to resist anymore. he lets his hand drop away from fletcher.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i'm afraid... of not being there...}
<A>__{fletcher stares at him, uncomprehending.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it's late. do you want me to take you back to your room?}
<A>__{fletcher shakes his head "no," just barely. then he disappears.}
