<L>__{exterior street near docks night}
<A>__{jetson, sykes, and wiltey move warily forward, their guns drawn. they reach the van and sykes takes wiltey's flashlight, shines it through the open back doors. the doors are bent outward, smashed half off their hinges. one of the body bags is ripped open, literally split from end to end. the blue and red lightbar on the other patrol car can be seen through the wagon's front windshield. jetson starts around the wagon toward the patrol car, sykes and wiltey follow. lights all ablaze, it too is abandoned. one door has been wrenched off its hinges and lays in the street, and the front windshield is smashed. our three cops approach the car, then wiltey spots something beyond the unit.}

<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{no he's not. not if he overdosed on the drug.}

<D>__{massive amounts trigger a... a change. your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation. when you emerge you're...}
