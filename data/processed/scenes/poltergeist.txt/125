<A>__{teague’s pov teague can see past steve and into the living room and staircase. all sorts of scientific equipment is strung around. the big console tv is tuned to a static channel, so is the kitchen portable, also visible from mr. teague’s vantage. teague looks over steve’s shoulder and steve tries to subtly block his view.}

<D>__{looks like your cable is out there.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{cable? yes, the cable. yes. we’ve had no tv for several days.}
<C>__{mr. teague}
<D>__{well, we should look into that. is the entire block dark?}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{uh, no, no... just us. just us.}
