<A>__{karen has straightened up the room, and is vacuuming the floor. something under the couch catches in the vacuum intake, jamming it. she turns off the vacuum and feels underneath, pulling out a crumpled photo ripped into pieces, compressed in a ball.}

<A>__{karen sits at the kitchen table, flattening and taping together the pieces of the photograph. she finishes. on the photo: a grinning japanese boy holds a cute black cat. his mother and father stand beside him. they're all beaming at the camera a perfect, happy family. but there's a piece missing. the mother's face. karen walks back into the living room. she looks underneath the couch for the missing piece. can't see anything. she lays down and sticks her arm under the couch, feeling around. nothing. karen sticks her arm in deeper, to the shoulder, straining... she suddenly jerks her arm back, wincing. she has a small cut on her finger. karen looks under the couch for what cut her a small furniture nail sticks out underneath.}
