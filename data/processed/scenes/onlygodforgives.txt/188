<A>__{two figures kneel on either side of the ring. julian and chang. both wearing mongkol. totally still. the ceremonial music begins... slowly julian and chang start to perform ram muay, the ancient, traditional dance which the rules of the game say must be carried out before a fight takes place. it is both strange and spiritual: julian and chang move their arms rhythmically, in time to the music, their hands describing shapes and outlining fighting positions. as the dance develops, so their positions become more combative; now crouching, now standing, hinting at the kicks and punches that they're about to perform... but all carried out with an almost beatific precision that is at odds with the violence that is about to follow...}
