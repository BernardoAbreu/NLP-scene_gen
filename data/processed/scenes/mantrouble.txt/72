<A>__{applause over. on a large tv screen, where a fervently solicitous host addresses the director. seated beside him is the actress previously seen on the billboard and in the movie trailer of blood and kisses.)}
<C>__{host }
<D>__{before we begin, why don't we show the audience a clip from the movie. do you want to set it up for us?}
<C>__{director }
<D>__{well, it's a bit... this scene involves... just go ahead and run it.}
<A>__{after clip:}
<C>__{host }
<P>__{(to the director)}
<D>__{i must say, this is a dazzling piece of work and you two are a dynamite wedding of talents...}
<A>__{joan hands helen one of the glasses, then sits down beside her. under the following, she picks up a pen and leans over the police document now resting on the coffee table.}
<C>__{host }
<D>__{but i hear you're a little sensitive about the criticism you've had about the amount of sexual violence and nudity you have in the picture...}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{'any scars, marks or tattoos.'}
<C>__{director }
<P>__{(overlapping her)}
<D>__{well it's absurd. in the first place, i didn't invent this genre. and it happens to be a tradition in this kind of film that women make more interesting and exciting victims than men do...}
<C>__{host }
<D>__{well, i understand...}
<A>__{she looks up from the document to the screen. then both women look at each other with their mouths open:}
<C>__{director }
<D>__{and secondly the violence directed at mimi's character is an essential component of the story, and is not in any sense of the word, gratuitous.}
<B>__{on tv screen}
<A>__{as the host turns to the actress:}
<C>__{host }
<D>__{but, mimi, now what about you. that scene where you run nude through times square with those multiple knife wounds all over your body. that must've been horrendous for you.}
<B>__{on joan}
<A>__{as she throws the pen down onto the coffee table:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{assholes.}
<C>__{actress }
<D>__{yes it was, very horrendous...}
<C>__{joan}
<P>__{(to helen)}
<D>__{come on, let me drive you home.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{wait.}
<C>__{actress }
<D>__{but what helped me enormously is that we shot the film in sequence...}
