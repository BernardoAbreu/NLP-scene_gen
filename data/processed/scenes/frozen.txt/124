<T>__{fade to black: fade in:}
<L>__{exterior chair lift the next morning}
<A>__{dawn is breaking over the trees. lynch and parker are still. their bodies are huddled together, but neither is moving. in fact, at a first glance, one might think they are both human popcycles. the dark splotches of frost bite on parker's nose and cheeks have now grown to what almost looks like patches of black fungus on her skin. lynch has the start of his own frost bite on his ears and nose. slowly, parker's eyes flutter and she awakens. her eyes search around as the realization that this was not all just a bad dream sinks in. she adjusts in her seat and feels something pull. she winces and looks down. slowly the camera follows her stare down to reveal her bare hand, gripping the icy safety bar. she pulls...but her skin is stuck to the frozen metal. beginning to panic, she jerks her hand hard, taking the bar up about half an inch with it.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{uhh...}
<A>__{painstakingly slow, she begins to peel her hand off of the bar. a sound that resembles `jeans slowly tearing' can be softly heard as she moves her arm forward and separates her hand from the skin that is attached to the metal. after what feels like an eternity, she gives her hand one last jerk, freeing it from the safety bar.}
<C>__{parker }
<D>__{ruuugh!}
<A>__{her movement startles lynch awake, and he bolts upright as if from a `falling nightmare'. discombobulated, lynch turns back and forth frantically trying to get his bearings. parker is crying and holding her bloody hand,}
<C>__{parker }
<D>__{shhhh.}
<A>__{lynch, bug eyed, takes in the world around him. a fresh coat of snow has covered everything in several inches of peaceful white bliss. below them, the snow has completely covered dan's remains. there is nothing left to show that there was ever even a struggle. parker hides her bloody hand back inside of her coat, away from lynch's eyes.}
<B>__{e}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{i...thought i was dreaming. this. i thought this was a dream.}
<A>__{he turns to look at parker. it takes everything he has to not jolt back in horror at how bad her face looks.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{your frost bite. it's getting...worse.}
<A>__{she starts to touch her face.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{really? how bad is it?}
<A>__{lynch stops her.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{don't. it's bad.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{it's not as itchy any more.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{just don't touch your face, ok? when we get out of here, we'll get you to a doctor right away and they'll fix it.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{you have some dark spots on your face, too.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{they'll fix me, too then. just don't touch it.}
<A>__{he looks around, front to back. in daylight it's easier to see the other chairs. his breath blows out of his body in huge plumes of mist.}
<C>__{lynch }
<D>__{well, it's morning. maybe someone will come up here now.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{for what?}
<B>__{e}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{i don't know. mountain maintenance. besides, when none of us show up for class people are going to start looking for us.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{no one's gonna look for me. i skip class all the time. by the time anyone notices i'm gone i will be dead.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{can you please just think one positive thing? please!}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{besides. no one knows we're here.}
<C>__{lynch}
<P>__{(to the sky)}
<D>__{hel lo!!! we need help!! help!!!}
<A>__{his voice echoes off of the frozen trees, almost as if taunting him. he turns around to look at the chairs behind him.}
<C>__{lynch }
<D>__{alright. look. if i can get to that chair...two back...i could make it to the ladder on that pole. i think i could make it down.}
<A>__{parker doesn't speak.}
<C>__{lynch }
<D>__{help me.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{are you sure you don't just wanna give it a few more hours? what if you're right? what if someone is going to come up here, even though they're not open today?}
<A>__{lynch doesn't respond. the look on his face says that "no one is coming" but he decides there's no harm in waiting just a little while longer. lynch tries to yell for help again, though his soar throat is making it almost impossible to scream.}
<B>__{e}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{up here! someone help us!}
<A>__{once again...only echoes. he re settles in his chair.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i just wish i could stand up. get out of this position for a minute.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{if you want, you can stand on the chair and i can hold onto you.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{no. i can't.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{well, if anything's gonna get you over your fear of heights, it's this.}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(quickly, sternly)}
<D>__{no. i'm fine.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{alright.}
