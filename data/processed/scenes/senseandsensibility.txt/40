<L>__{exterior road to and from barton cottage day}
<A>__{in comparison to norland, barton cottage has the air of a damp shoebox. it sits low and bleak in the grey lonely countryside. from one side we can see the dashwoods' carriage drawing up at the gate. from the other, a much grander vehicle, from which loud whooping can be heard, is approaching.}
<L>__{exterior barton cottage garden path day}
<A>__{as the exhausted dashwoods alight, they converge with a ruddy complexioned man in a redingote (sir john middleton) and a rotund, equally roseate lady (mrs jennings) who have fallen over each other in their haste to get out of their carriage.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{sir john!}
<A>__{sir john clasps her hands and starts to help her up the path, followed by elinor, marianne and margaret, who is clearly fascinated by his bouncy companion.}
<C>__{sir john}
<D>__{dear ladies, dear ladies, upon my word, here you are, here you are, here you are!}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{sir john, your extraordinary kindness }
<C>__{sir john}
<D>__{oh, none of that, hush, please, none of that, but here is my dear mamma in law mrs jennings.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{was the journey tolerable, you poor souls?}
<C>__{sir john}
<D>__{why did you not come up to the park first and take your ease? we saw you pass like many people who live rather lonely lives together.}
<A>__{sir john and mrs jennings talk incessantly, interrupt each other all the time and never listen.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{ but i would not wait for you to come to us, i made john call for the carriage }
<C>__{sir john}
<D>__{she would not wait, you know.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{ as we get so little company.}
<A>__{they reach the front door and betsy's smiling welcome. in the confusion of milling people and thomas carrying the lighter luggage, marianne contrives to slip into the house alone. we follow her but hear the conversation continuing in v.o. marianne looks about the parlour, where a dismal fire is smoking. she starts up the stairs, expressionless.}
<C>__{mrs jennings }
<D>__{but i feel as if i know you already delightful creatures!}
<C>__{sir john }
<D>__{delightful! and you know you are to dine at barton park every day.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood }
<D>__{oh, but dear sir john, we cannot }
<C>__{sir john }
<D>__{oh, no no no no no no no, i shall not brook refusals. i am quite deaf to 'em, you know }
<C>__{mrs jennings }
<D>__{ deaf }
<A>__{marianne enters a small bedroom. she sits on the bed. then she goes to the window and opens it. voices float up.}
<C>__{sir john }
<D>__{but i insist!}
<C>__{elinor }
<D>__{let us only settle in for a few days, sir john, and thank you }
<C>__{sir john }
<D>__{oh, no thankings, no, please, can't bear 'em, embarrassing, you know }
<A>__{marianne closes the window and crosses the corridor to another bed room similarly stark. she sighs and turns back down the stairs.}
<C>__{sir john }
<D>__{we will send game and fruit as a matter of course }
<C>__{mrs jennings }
<D>__{ fruit and game }
<C>__{sir john }
<D>__{ and the carriage is at your beck and call }
<A>__{marianne joins the group, who are now in the parlour.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{ call and here is miss marianne!}
<C>__{sir john}
<D>__{where did you disappear to?}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{i declare you are the loveliest girl i ever set eyes on! cannot you get them married, mrs dashwood? you must not leave it too long!}
<C>__{sir john}
<D>__{but, alas, there are no smart young men hereabouts to woo them }
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{ not a beau for miles!}
<A>__{the strain of exhibiting joy and gratitude is beginning to tell on mrs dashwood who is sagging visibly.}
<C>__{sir john}
<D>__{come, mother, let us leave them in peace.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{but there is colonel brandon!}
<A>__{sir john is dragging her down the path.}
<C>__{sir john}
<D>__{excellent fellow! we served in the east india regiment together.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{just wait till he sees you! if we can persuade him out to meet you!}
<C>__{sir john}
<D>__{reclusive individual. but you are fatigued. i can see that you are fatigued.}
<A>__{now he is pushing her into the carriage.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{of course she is fatigued!}
<C>__{sir john}
<D>__{come along, mother, we really must leave them to themselves.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{you must get your maidservant to make you up some camphor it is the best tonic for the staggers!}
<C>__{sir john}
<D>__{send thomas to us for the carriage when you are ready!}
<A>__{they take off, waving wildly. margaret goes down the path to watch them and turns back to her slightly stunned family.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{i like them.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{what generosity.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{indeed. i am surprised they did not offer us their clothing.}
