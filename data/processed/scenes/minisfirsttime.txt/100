<L>__{interior the hallway continuous}
<A>__{diane stumbles down the hallway, almost tripping on the steps down to the living room. she goes straight for the phone on the end table next to the couch. she picks it up.}
<C>__{recorded voice }
<D>__{please continue to hold, your call will be answered...}
<A>__{she hangs up the phone and looks back at the hallway, but as she does, she sees reflected in a wall mirror: another black clad figure outside the living room window, but this one holds a hand axe. she turns around to look out the window. the figure raises the axe slowly.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{no...no...help! help!}
<A>__{she heads towards the front door to scream for help, but the axe wielding figure moves swiftly towards the door, making it unsafe for her to even try. her face dissolves into utter despair, as she stumbles out of the room.}
