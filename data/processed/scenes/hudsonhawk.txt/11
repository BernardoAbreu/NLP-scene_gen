<L>__{exterior outside alex's bar night}
<A>__{the guys move through the personably jersey face of the bar. the empire state building beams in the background. sinatra cuts off.}
<L>__{interior alex's bar night}
<A>__{it's changed. hawk and alex enter into what has become the ultimate pseudo art deco fern littered nightmare, packed with noisy, insufferably self absorbed yups. a violently erotic and pretentious video plays upon elevated t.v. sets set up all around the place. hawk's mouth gapes as he drifts by a sickening couple toasting wine coolers, and two very young brokers high fiving each other after missing a dartboard.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i didn't know how to tell you. a couple brokers stopped in for stoley spritzers one night. next thing i know fast track digest votes us "watering hole of the month." now, i'm shopping for aqua salmon wallpaper.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{i read about these people in newsweek. where's all the regulars, crazy jeff cava, the todd sisters, indian joe? where's ed kranepool's autograph? captain bob's steering wheel?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{hey, get this irritable guy a cappuccino. i gotta go be a boss.}
<A>__{alex lifts a piece of the bar and moves behind it. snatching up a menu, hawk calls out...}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{this is pizza? reindeer goat cheese? i admit, i've been known to go wild and order a canadian bacon in my time, but..}
<A>__{hawk lights up a cigarette. a tortoise shell non smoker immediately turns to him wearing a "yes, i mind if you smoke" button.}
<D>__{tortoise shell non smoker can you read.... smoker?}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{can you take a sunrise and sprinkle it with dew? tortoise shell non smoker}
<P>__{(huh?)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{the candy man can, felix. you know, i thought this was a country where you could do any stupid thing you wanted; drive to work naked, make love to a v.c.r. guess i'm wrong. maybe that's why i became a serial arsonist. tortoise shell non smoker hey, it's okay, big guy. smoke all you want. have mine....}
<A>__{the non smoker fumbles out a pack of cigarettes and flees. a cappuccino in cup and saucer slides down the bar saloon style. a smiling hawk picks it up, turns away from the bar and closes his eyes, bringing the cup to his lips until a police badge swirls into frame and splashes into the cup, splattering coffee over hawk's blazer.}
<C>__{gates }
<D>__{you're under arrest...}
<A>__{hawk makes eye contact up to a crude, coarse, and cackling island of a man, officer gates, amid the sea of oblivious and self obsessed yuppitude, standing by a table.}
<C>__{gates}
<D>__{have a seat. good to see you, buddy ol' pal...}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{the pleasure's all yours, officer gates.}
<B>__{back of the bar}
<A>__{with concern, alex watches hawk sit at gates' table. gates' table gates pillages a plate of spaghetti and meatballs with terrifying precision. hawk tosses the badge onto the food. gates eats around it.}
<C>__{gates}
<D>__{why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? especially after i got you such a nice job.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{what job?}
<A>__{gates pulls up the black canvas bag and puts it on the table.}
<C>__{gates}
<D>__{the auction house, asshole. one night's work and you're free like no ex con's ever been. no checking in with a shrink, no community service teaching retards how to play air hockey. it's a great deal, i can't lie.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{the only thing you can't do is get sex for free. i know i was in prison for like basically the 80's, but, call me daffy, aren't you supposed to stop me from committing crimes. you know, book em dano, call for backup, give a hoot don't pollute.}
<A>__{gates thunders out of his chair and moves around to sneer down at hawk. behind gates, on the t.v. screens, are analogous images of disgusting animals and monsters.}
<C>__{gates}
<D>__{you wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me! i did dog and pony for you! you think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the three stooges...}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{how was i supposed to know they were women? besides one of them was bald and kept saying "soitinly."}
<A>__{gates simmers into his seat with a self control smile.}
<C>__{gates}
<D>__{remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself?}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{gates}
<D>__{remember that shoe you lost...}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{uh, yeah. cut to the chase.}
<A>__{gates pulls up a shoe and puts it on the table.}
<C>__{gates}
<D>__{one phone call and your shoe will become a piece of evidence and that suicide'll become a murder.}
<A>__{hawk bobs under the table and up.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{what else do you got under there ... i don't want to be rude, but this is all pretty lame.}
<C>__{gates}
<D>__{that's the beauty. it's bullshit, but i can make it stick because i'm a good guy parole officer and you re a bad guy who's about to find out that there's a thin line between ex con and escape con.}
<A>__{alex suddenly approaches the table.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{how is everything tonight, sir?}
<C>__{gates}
<D>__{beat it, alex. you're a dinosaur.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{alex, did you know this ape was going to be here...}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{sure. that's why his meatballs are made out of marinated chuck wagon.}
<C>__{gates}
<P>__{(mouthful)}
<D>__{you're full of shit.}
<A>__{as alex speaks, an eating dog is on the screens.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{no, man, actually you are. just add water and it makes its own gravy. keeps your teeth healthy and your coat shiny.}
<A>__{gates grabs the shoes and races off, gagging. hawk gets up to laugh next to alex. their laughter dies as they turn to look at the black canvas bag left on the table between them.}
