The BULLET, still in its crate, now basks in bright, tropical sunshine, surrounded by an azure sea. - The crate is removed by a pair of slim, dark hands, revealing a glimpse of the bustling, weathered port of Abidjan in the Ivory Coast.  The crate is one of dozens unloaded from the ship. - BULLET's POV from another open-air truck, now slogging through a mud-clogged road in lush rainforest. - The BULLET is unloaded from the truck in Freetown, Sierra Leone - immediately grabbed by the young HAND of a RUF soldier. - The BULLET is loaded into a 30-round magazine which is inserted into an AK-47 machine gun. - The BULLET waits - in the gloomy chamber.  Suddenly, from outside, the sound of raised voices and gunfire. - The BULLET and its neighbors start to rise quickly up the magazine towards the chamber as the Kalashnikov is fired. - Our hero BULLET is next.  Will it see action? - Smack.  The gun's bolt strieks the explosive cap, gunpowder ignited, the BULLET driven out of the barrel. - Shed of its casing - now only a slug - the BULLET emerges into bright sunshine.  It is flying down the main street in Freetown. - The BULLET gives us a perfect point-of-view of the bullet ahead of it.  They are both flying towards their intended target - a wild- eyed CHILD SOLDIER, a boy no more than twelve, firing an AK-47 almost as tall as he is. - The leading bullet narrowly misses, whistles past the boy's ear, striking the whitewashed wall behind - one more pock-mark in a building riddled with pock-marks. - Our BULLET, following close behind, finds its mark, slamming into the boy's forehead just above his left eye - his expression, oddly relieved. - The BULLET carves through the lobes of the boy's brain where it is enveloped in blood, finally plunged into darkness - the bullet's final resting place.}
