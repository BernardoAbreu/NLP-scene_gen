<L>__{exterior industrial area, junk yard night}
<A>__{mills follows doe past rusting collections of machines. we took this walk with doe before, through this metallic bone yard.}
<C>__{john doe}
<D>__{it's right this way.}
<A>__{mills is on edge. his eyes search the towering, twisted junk. sharp edges reach for the sky. glass breaks under their feet.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{so far, so good.}
<A>__{sounds of boats on the river can be heard. doe's heading for the alleyway created by two warehouses beyond the junk yard. doe nears the alleyway. it is pitch dark. doe stops before entering, turns to mills.}
<C>__{john doe}
<D>__{in here.}
<A>__{mills steps up, keeping his distance from doe. he can't see a thing in the blackness ahead.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{you go first.}
<A>__{doe faces the alley. he starts walking. we move with him as he goes. he's counting silently to himself, moving his lips. mills walks behind doe, keeping a sharp eye out in all directions. he's about ten feet behind doe, keeping his gun trained on the back of doe's skull.}
<C>__{mills }
<D>__{tell me where we're going.}
<A>__{doe continues walking, counting his steps, a bit quicker.}
