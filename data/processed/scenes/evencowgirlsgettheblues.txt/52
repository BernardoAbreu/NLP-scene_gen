<L>__{interior main house}
<A>__{the bare assed cowgirls storm into the beauty parlor and exercise rooms. sounds of breaking glass and wood splintering. the air is singing with cries of "wahoo," yippee," "let 'er buck" and "the vagina is a self cleaning organ."}

<A>__{sissy flees the house as she hunkers down out the back door.}
<L>__{exterior croquet court}
<A>__{sissy running across it. she passes the pool, and falls in. climbing out, wet, scared, she runs to the base of siwash ridge and southward along the mountain's foot. eventually sissy comes to a place where the juniper bushes are broken to reveal a crude path beginning a steep ascent. sissy decides to climb up it. she shoulders her way through low, slivery boughs. approximately halfway up the ridge she rests on a flat rock from which she can look down on the... burning rubber rose smoking away, distant yahoos and carryings on can be heard. horses whinney in the corral. a few gunshots are thrown into the soundtrack if things aren't lively enough. miss adrian's cadillac, on fire, roars out of the drive. sissy looks up to the quiet mountain. pauses. then she looks back to the chaos below. the cinematographers' rented convertible and their equipment van drive away. sissy sits and wonders. the sun is setting on the horizon, mixing well with the firelight that the rubber rose is giving off. but she is aware of something watching her. looking about she sees nothing. view of an empty trail. view of a quivering bush. sissy turns to the sound of the chink.}
<C>__{chink}
<D>__{ha ha ho ho hee hee.}
<A>__{and there he is. standing only ten yards away. the chink's problem is that he looks like he rolled out of a zen scroll, as if he says "presto" a lot, knows the meaning of lightning and the origin of dreams. he looks as if he drinks dew and fucks snakes. sissy and the chink scrutinize one another with mutual fascination.}
<C>__{chink}
<D>__{ha ha ho ho and hee hee.}
<A>__{sissy is just about to speak, but before she does the chink whirls, and scampers up the mountainside.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{wait!}
<A>__{warily he stops and turns, poised to flee again. sissy smiles. she raises her ripe right thumb. and jerking it and swooshing it, she hitchhikes the chink and his mountain. there he stands where sissy's thumbs have stopped him. the chink wears the wary look of a wild animal. he's not going to stay stopped long. it is sissy's move.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{well, aren't you going to shake your whanger at me?}
<A>__{the chink pauses for a moment, then he slaps his thighs and giggles hysterically. ha has, ho hos and hee hees squirt out of his nose and through the gaps in his teeth.}

<D>__{follow me. i will fix you supper.}
<A>__{the two doggedly walk up the steep trail.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{i'm a friend of bonanza jellybean's.}
<C>__{chink}
<D>__{i know who you are.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{oh? well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. i came up here to get out of the way. it's so dark now i doubt if i could find my way back down. if you could help...}
<C>__{chink}
<P>__{(voice that wears no pants)}
<D>__{save your breath for the climb.}
<A>__{sissy takes another look at the rubber rose, which is now quiet. we can hear faintly a distant popping of washcloths and girlish laughter. they make their way into a depression at the top of the mountain down a ladder of sticks. the chink lights a large fire in the middle of the depression. he puts a kettle of stew over the fire, and begins to roast yams. the chink's face as the fire dances off it. a can of chung king water chestnuts is opened.}
