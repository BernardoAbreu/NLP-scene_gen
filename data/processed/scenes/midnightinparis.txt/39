<C>__{hemingway}
<D>__{this month it's writing, last month it was something else. you're a writer you need time to write not all this playing around she's wasting you because she's really a competitor don't you agree?}

<C>__{hemingway}
<D>__{what the hell's a nostalgia shop?}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{where they sell old things memorabilia. does that sound terrible to you?}
<C>__{hemingway}
<D>__{no subject is terrible if the story is true. if the prose is clean and honest and if it affirms courage and grace under pressure.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{would you do me the biggest favor in the world i can't even ask}
<C>__{hemingway}

<C>__{gil}
<D>__{you do?}
<C>__{hemingway}

<C>__{gil}
<D>__{but there's no one i really trust to evaluate it }
<C>__{hemingway}
<D>__{writers are competitive.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{i could never compete with you }
<C>__{hemingway}
<D>__{you're too self effacing it's not manly. if you're a writer, declare yourself the best writer but you're not the best as long as i'm around. unless you want to put the gloves on and settle it.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{no no that's okay }
<C>__{hemingway}
