<L>__{interior john's lounge night}
<A>__{nadia sits alone at the dining room table. suddenly the lights go out. john enters, carrying a small birthday cake glowing with candles. the light throws huge shadows on the walls and flickers across their faces. he sets the cake down on the table and sits down opposite nadia}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{happy birthday to you. happy birthday to you. happy birthday dear nadia...}
<A>__{the front doorbell rings. a loud long burst. nadia's face transforms into a big grin. she hurries out into the hall, leaving john alone with the cake. nadia whooping and shouting excitedly. other voices. shouting. shouting in russian. a man bursts in carrying nadia in his arms. he spins her round in the candlelight, kisses her, puts her down and goes to the table where he blows out the candles. they are plunged into darkness. lots of whooping and laughing. a zippo flares up and illuminates some faces, all laughing.}
