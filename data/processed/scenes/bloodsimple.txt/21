<A>__{as ray's door flies open. he is bolting from the car. the camera, at waist level, tracks toward him as he races out into the field that abuts the highway. fifty yards in he finally stops, panting, framed from a low angle. his breath vaporizes in the crisp night air. we hear only his breath and the chirring of crickets. he is looking back toward the road. ray's pov long shot the car standing abandoned on the shoulder of the deserted highway. its headlights cast a lonely beam up the road. no movement.}
