<L>__{interior cathedral}
<A>__{close on an elderly, kind looking cardinal. he ascends the steps to the pulpit and looks out on his large congregation. we see that tv cameras are covering the sunday service. he gins his homily.}
<C>__{cardinal}
<D>__{in today's gospel, the lord tells us who we are to live if we wish to attain the splendor of heaven... or something like that. jesus sure says a lot of stuff in the bible. moses this. moses that. abraham hit me with a whiffle ball bat.}
<A>__{the crowd stares dumbfounded. we see that the cardinal is standing on a steaming hot pizza which is still in the box with the top open.}
<C>__{cardinal }
<D>__{yep, the lord sure did say a bunch of hibbity jibbity. but has he ever really done anything for us? has he ever put a jaguar xjr in my driveway? has he ever given any of my enemies the herpes? no. he hasn't done a damn thing for any of us.}
<A>__{a middle aged woman stands up.}
<D>__{middle aged woman the lord gave my son the strength to get off drugs.}
<C>__{cardinal}
<D>__{ma'am, i know your son, and believe me, he was better off on drugs. he's a bore. at least when he was smoking hashish, he made me laugh occasionally.}
<A>__{a young man and his pregnant wife stand up.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{after we tried for many years, the lord finally helped my wife conceive a baby.}
<C>__{cardinal}
<D>__{no, your best friend fitzie helped your wife conceive a baby. he helped her conceive it all night long.}
<A>__{fitzie, who's sitting on the other side of the wife, starts to "raise the roof." then thinks better of it. the cardinal points to a well dressed man in the front pew.}
<C>__{cardinal }
<D>__{how about you, mr. mayor? the lord ever do anything for you?}
<A>__{the mayor has tinfoil on his feet.}
<C>__{mayor}
<P>__{(standing)}
<D>__{well, i wish i could think of something, cardinal, but to be honest with you, i can't. kind of makes you wonder if there even is a lord. if there is any ultimate punishment for our so called "sins." maybe we should all just have fun and do whatever the hell we want.}
<A>__{a hubbub is raised by the crowd. fitzie raises the roof again, this time energetically.}
<C>__{cardinal}
<D>__{amen to that. let the sin begin!}
<A>__{the hubbub grows to a roar. several people start fighting over the money in the collection plate. the cardinal smiles knowingly at the mayor. we hear the cardinal's thoughts in adrian's voice.}
<C>__{adrian }
<D>__{oh, this is delicious.}
<B>__{on mayor}
<A>__{he's smirking. we hear his telepathic response.}
<C>__{cassius }
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{"let the sin begins" that was a good one.}
<C>__{adrian }
<D>__{well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our new hell. how are things going down at city hall?}
<C>__{cassius }
<D>__{i lowered the drinking age to ten.}
<C>__{adrian }
<D>__{brilliant. this is so much fun. i never want it to end.}
<C>__{cassius }
<D>__{why should it end? who's gonna stop us?}
<A>__{the mayor cassius laughs. as he does, his eyes slowly cross.}
