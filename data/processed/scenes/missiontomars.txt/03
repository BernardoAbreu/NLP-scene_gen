<L>__{exterior lawn party. luke graham's house. late afternoon}
<A>__{descending, we see phil ohlmyer, late 20's, kneeling, with a gaggle of eager children around him. phil, an astronaut, has got an impressive array of fireworks lined up, and is using an empty longneck as his launching tube.}
<C>__{children}
<P>__{(all at once)}
<D>__{my turn! my turn! no, i was next! no, me! uncle phil, uncle phil, can i do one? i want to do one!}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{guys, guys, please! this is risky stuff here. and i'm a highly trained professional.}
<A>__{derisive groans from the kids, more shouts. phil grins. there's little danger nasa will ever use him on a recruiting poster: he's messy, very hyper. phil waves his hands for silence.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{okay, okay! uncle phil will launch another booster...}
<A>__{another astronaut, renee cote, a tall, very fit french woman, is walking by with a fresh six pack. she tosses a beer and phil catches it.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{...just as soon as he completes his fuel intake.}
<B>__{angle follows cote}
<A>__{who grins, walking away from phil and the kids, as we begin to get a better sense of the scope of this party. we are in the big back yard of a middle class home in a houston suburb. dozens of people astronauts, nasa personnel, and their families are gathered around picnic tables or spread out blankets. lots of red, white and blue bunting, lots of balloons. we hear snatches of music, mostly country flavored, from dueling boomboxes. futuristic frisbees are being tossed about. a banner, strung between trees, reads "bon voyage, mars one!!!"}
<C>__{willis}
<D>__{it'll take us six months just to get to mars. another year on the surface, then six months back. that's two years...}
<A>__{passing the banner, cote lobs a beer to another astronaut, nicholas willis, who snags it neatly. he's got his other arm around the waist of a pretty girl. as cote moves out of frame, angle lingers on these two. willis, a very young astronaut, early 20s, is recruiting poster material, and knows it all too well.}
<C>__{willis}
<D>__{i guess what i'm trying to say is, since this is my last night on earth, it's gonna be a very precious memory to me. y'know?}
<C>__{pretty girl}
<D>__{nice try, nick.}
<A>__{as the pretty girl slips out of his grasp, laughing, and walks away, willis shrugs philosophically. he pops open his beer, swigs it. angle follows the pretty girl as she swerves around an open pit barbecue, where other astronauts are gathered. cote has paused here, too, distributing the last of her beers. sergei kirov, a russian cosmonaut, is watching some kids nearby as they play a game of wiffle ball. he turns, grinning beerily at the chef.}
<C>__{kirov}
<D>__{hey, woody, our mars one crew won't be heading back to earth till ten days after you guys land at our base camp with mars two. that's a pretty good long rendezvous.}
<A>__{woody blake, late 30s, is a big, rangy guy in a cowboy hat over a hawaiian shirt and a "kiss the chef" apron. an entire pig is turning on a spit over the flames, and woody is basting this as he smiles at malik.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{what are you suggesting, sergei?}
<C>__{kirov}
<D>__{maybe you should bring a baseball bat. yes? american baseball? our two crews could have ourselves a little solar system series.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{please. half you guys are foreigners. we'd crush you.}
<C>__{kirov}
<D>__{no, no, we have equal crews. three men, one woman. same handicap.}
<A>__{he grins teasingly at cote, who makes a face at him.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{easy now, you're talking about my wife.}
<P>__{(seeing her approach)}
<D>__{and terri just happens to be one helluva shortstop.}
<A>__{dr. terri fisher, early 30s, passes by with a platter of corn on the cob. short, sturdy body, a face made attractive by its alert, questing intelligence. she pauses to kiss woody's cheek; there's a wonderful, sexy spark between them. then she glances at kirov, all business now.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{fast pitch, no steals, batter calls his own strikes. thousand bucks make it interesting?}
<A>__{he's a bit rattled by her cockiness, and looks at cote, who smiles, nods her cool agreement.}
<C>__{cote}
<D>__{eh bien. winner take all.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{good.}
<P>__{(smiles sweetly at kirov)}
<D>__{bring some balls.}
<A>__{the other men ooooh at this, busting on kirov and cote, as terri moves on. woody, watching her go, has a thousand watt grin.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{you wanna know the sad part? technically i outrank her. but if we want any peace at all on mars two, i'm gonna be saying a lot of "yes, dears."}
<A>__{the others laugh. angle follows terri as she dodges a pack of kids they run by her, shrieking happily before she finally reaches a picnic table, where astronauts' wives are opening containers of baked beans, coleslaw, and potato salad.}
<D>__{1st wife ...just not sure how i feel about nasa allowing couples to go on this type of mission together.}
<A>__{one of the other women raises a warning eyebrow, and the 1st wife turns, sees terri setting down her platter.}
<D>__{1st wife}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{nothing personal, terri. it's just that, well, it's kind of a funny feeling for those of us staying behind.}
<C>__{terri}
<P>__{(carefully neutral)}
<D>__{all the research shows that marriage will provide stability on these long duration trips. 2nd wife then they haven't studied some of the couples i've known.}
<A>__{laughter at this. terri smiles politely she doesn't really have much in common with these women before moving on. angle lingers on the wives, who watch her go with a slight tinge of jealousy. one of them is looking around.}
<D>__{3rd wife anybody seen jim mcconnell? 4th wife i don't think he's coming. 1st wife god, that poor man. how's he doing? 2nd wife totally losing it, from what i hear. can't sleep, can't eat. visits her grave almost every day.}
<P>__{(lowers her voice)}
<D>__{they say he could lose mission status. 3rd wife oh, that's so sad. that is just so tragic. you go to a routine physical one day, and wham. 4th wife after all those years of training, too. it was their whole dream. 1st wife must be a pretty funny feeling for luke graham. y'know? now he's gonna be in the history books. first man on mars...}
<A>__{she shakes her head, awed by the thought. the others nod in agreement, following her glance... in the distance, a lone male figure stands by the garage, his back to them, facing the parked cars, vans, and suvs which stretch down the driveway and along the street. another figure, a woman, can be seen approaching him. closer angle follows the moving woman debra graham, early}
