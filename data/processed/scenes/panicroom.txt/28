<L>__{interior stairwell night}
<A>__{back in the stairwell, the exact reverse of the shot we saw earlier. we're drifting up, off the kitchen floor, through the entry floor, and as we rise we notice something all the way up on the roof that we couldn't see before, when we were looking down. a skylight. we continue to rise, drawn toward it. we move up, through the master bedroom floor, creeping up alongside the stair banister, now reaching the top floor of the house, and just as we near the skylight a figure appears, visible through it. the man in dark clothes, on the roof now. he stops, peers down through the skylight, looking at us without seeing us again. he steps across the skylight. this is not the way he intends to enter. we drift again, following his soft footsteps on the roof, which we can hear faintly through the ceiling. here in the hall, just outside sarah's bedroom, a closet door is ajar. we squeeze through the gap and into the closet. in the closet, it's completely dark. can't see a thing. but then a sliver of light appears, coming from above. we look up. there is a ladder that's bolted to the wall in this closet, it leads up to a square panel in the ceiling. roof access. and that roof access panel is moving, ever so slightly, moonlight spilling in as it twists in its setting. a shiny silver something slides through the crack along the edges of the portal. it slithers along the edge of the hatchway, searching for something. it finds a small round nub in the crack. the silver something stops. it hums with electricity for a moment, then there is a bright spark and a soft crack.}
