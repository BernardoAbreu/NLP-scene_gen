<D>__{shit...}
<L>__{exterior oklahoma highway 40 corey's chevrolet day}
<A>__{by the time they pull over on the side of the empty highway, steam billows out from under the hood. sam gets out of the car to check on it while corey remains behind the wheel. sam peeks under the hood, trying to clear the air of the steam. it sounds like someone is rhythmically tapping the inside of the engine with a hammer.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{turn it off.}
<C>__{corey}
<P>__{(poking her head out the window)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{turn off the car.}
<A>__{corey does so.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{doesn't look too good...}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it smells funny.}
<A>__{sam looks up when she hears a pick up truck coming toward them. corey watches as she steps out to wave it down... the pick up pulls over ahead of them. chris holt (24), a brawny, attractive young man, gets out. when corey sees him she gets out too.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{thanks for stopping. our car's messed up.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{my check engine light came on, then it just started smoking, and ticking and shit.}
<A>__{as chris pokes around under the hood, sam and corey exchange looks. chris pops opens the coolant cap and burns his hand on the steam explosion.}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(shaking it off)}
<D>__{blew your water pump. can't drive it.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{fuck me...}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{el reno's just a couple miles up ahead. can call for a tow there. c'mon, i will give you a lift.}
<A>__{i e. chris' truck el reno, various day all three crammed into the cab of the pick up, they drive through the center of el reno, oklahoma (population 16,000) and see some of the locals out and about [music montage fueled by early to mid 90s era grunge rock (suggestion: come as you are, by nirvana) reminiscent of the `middlesex middle school montage' in donnie darko]: agatha dowdy (54), an employee of the local diner, sits on a bench in front of the establishment smoking a cigarette. the manager, ted moncton (50), calls her back inside... randy evans (21), ruth gibbens (18) and jeff (21) and mike jimenez (20) loiter in the parking lot of a liquor store... trudy potter (39) flirts with father homeijer (54), a catholic priest, outside the bank. a bank sign shows the time 12:00 pm then flashes to the date june 18, 1995... officer ryan o'dell (31) has pulled over a pretty lady and uses his uniform to impress more than intimidate... they come up on vietnam tom (48), who ambles along the side of the road against traffic, and he waves to them as they pass. he wears old, weather beaten clothes and a multi colored ski mask over his head and face... [end montage] sam swivels her head to watch tom. another car passes and he waves to it as well. chris picks up on her curiosity.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{he waves to everybody... just kinda walks up and down.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{resident nutcase?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{people call him vietnam tom.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{he was in the war?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{he thinks he was... kind of a joke, ya know?}
<A>__{sam continues to stare until he disappears out of sight... pan down to a puddle by the side of the road. as a car tire splashes through it, pan up to find: i e. dusty's garage house afternoon dusty's auto repair shop, which is nothing more than a big garage attached to his old two story house. corey's car has been towed there, and dusty gibbens (37; father of ruth gibbens), the lone mechanic, tinkers around under the hood. sam and corey sit on the front steps of the house waiting, bored as hell. a pit bull laps at a nameless treat wedged into a crack in the walkway. the girls are forced to get up when ruth (from outside the liquor store) comes to the door.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{can i get out?}
<A>__{sam and corey move so that she can exit the house. ruth's look is hardened, rough around the edges she appears older than her 18 years. the girls watch as she enters the garage to see her father. she whispers something in his ear, and dusty hands her some cash, which she pockets then kisses him on the cheek. after this, dusty wipes his hands on his greasy jeans and comes outside to address corey and sam.}
<C>__{dusty}
<D>__{yeah... it's the water pump.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{so what do we do?}
<C>__{dusty}
<D>__{i can order you up a new one. probably be a couple days.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{great. this the only show in town?}
<C>__{dusty}
<D>__{cheapest and the best. but you want me to call the tow guy back here, no problem. probably charge you another hundred bucks, but he'll get ya wherever you wanna go.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{just go ahead and fix it.}
