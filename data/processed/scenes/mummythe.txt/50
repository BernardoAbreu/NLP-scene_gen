<L>__{interior imhotep's chamber night}
<A>__{evelyn's voice is overlaid as we start wide on imhotep's chamber and slowly push in on his sarcophagus. we push in over the lip of the coffin, then closer and closer towards imhotep's rotten, twisted head, until his putrid face fills frame, and then suddenly his crusty eyelids pop open! revealing empty sockets. big scary music sting.}
<L>__{exterior base camp night}
<A>__{the egyptologist sits bolt upright. quickly looks around, sees evelyn reading the book. he gets up and runs for her.}
<C>__{egyptologist}
<D>__{no! noooo! you must not!}
<A>__{he skids to a stop as a strange, piercing whine is heard, coming from out in the desert. o'connell and the others all leap to their feet. the americans run out of their tents. the sound gets louder and closer. and then from out of the darkness a huge wall of locusts swirls into camp and envelops everyone. o'connell grabs evelyn, and with jonathan at their side they race for the crevice, trying to fend off the horrid vermin as they go. beni and the americans run for the temple. the egyptologist is covered in locusts. he stares at the book of the dead, looking haunted.}
