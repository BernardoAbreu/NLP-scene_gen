<C>__{reting rinpoche}
<D>__{centuries ago, a young boy was born. his name was gedundrub. the night of his birth, robbers came to his home and his family fled hiding the baby in a cattle pen. when they returned the next day, the baby was safe. they found him guarded by a pair of black crows. he was the first dalai lama. the living buddha of compassion. now, you have chosen to come back to this life once again.}

(it is the master of the kitchen who stands directly behind the curtain.) the lord chamberlain is also there. he is a monk. a tall, angular man, with almost nordic features: large, round eyes, a yellowish mustache, sharp nose. all of these men will become quite familiar to us, as will the man standing, listening, behind the attendants. he is a sweeper, a man named norbu thundrup, age thirty. he is tall, and gangly, with a wispy beard and a pock marked face.}

<L>__{interior hallway day}
<A>__{the lord chamberlain touches the boy's shoulder and tenzin gyatso leaves his hiding place, as the speaker's voice fades away. as the two walk down the hallway, tenzin gyatso spots an unusual wooden door. he lets the lord chamberlain get a little bit ahead of him, and then the boy tries the door. it is heavy. it almost opens.}

<D>__{maybe in the next life, the world will not need a dalai lama. nornu thundrup i would not know. maybe.}
<A>__{the view travels and we see a prison yard. shackled men share the yard with hairy, fat dogs. one man looks up and sees that the yard is under surveillance. of course the men all know that this terrace belongs to the boy dalai lama. as the boy watches, first one poor, ragged man, then another prostrates. tenzin gyatso pulls away from the telescope. he waves to the prisoners.}

<A>__{the boy rides in his palanquin of yellow silk. he is older now, seven or eight. he peers through the curtain. a grand procession carries the dalai lama from the potala to his summer residence, the norbulinka. monks walk in procession, as do members of the aristocracy, wearing their finest gowns and jewelry, holding their finest parasols, and soldiers, wearing ancient uniforms. there are horses, banners and carriages. bodyguards carry the dalai lama's possessions wrapped in yellow silk. a band plays, "god save the king." it is a magnificent display, and along the side of the road, tibetans prostrate in the presence of the boy, not daring to look at him.}
