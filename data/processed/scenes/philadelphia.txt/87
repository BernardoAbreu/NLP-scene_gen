<A>__{courthouse men's room, five urinals, three sinks (interior day). the marine juror, the retired postal worker juror, and an uptight businessman juror stand at the urinals, with an empty urinal between each of them. the marine juror whistles while he pees (a classic rock tune, like "radar love.") the businessman sighs, "ahhhhhh." the retired postal worker juror jingles change. the rock musician juror enters, stepping up to the urinal between the businessman and the marine. he unzips, and it seems to take him an incredibly long time to extricate his urinary organ. this does not escape the marine's notice.}

<D>__{i have some gay friends. what's the biggie?}

<D>__{everybody has a couple of gay friends. don't you?}
<C>__{marine}
<D>__{no, sir. i do not.}
<A>__{the marine moves closer to the urinal, so that no one can see his private parts.}
<C>__{rock musician juror}
<D>__{you might have them, and just not know they're gay.}
<A>__{the marine shakes, zips, flushes, turns away. he pauses to look directly at the rock musician juror.}
<C>__{marine}
<D>__{i know.}
