<L>__{interior grant garage moments later}
<A>__{grant enters the garage through a door from the foyer. he flips the lights on with his shoulder. he looks around. grant spots an old file cabinet. he sets the tower of meat down on the oily floor and opens a drawer. it's filled with files. he closes that drawer, and opens another. it has manila file folders, but no files. grant takes out the folders. he uses a sharpie to write out "baloney" on a folder. then he stuffs all the baloney into the folder and files it away. he starts writing out "pastrami".}
