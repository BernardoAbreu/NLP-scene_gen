<L>__{exterior cukor house lawn day}
<A>__{a sunny patio with hedges and statues. wickets and stakes have been set up for a game of croquet, but only a handful of very tanned children strut around with mallets.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{what did i tell you? listen.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i don't hear anything.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{exactly. cukor was too cheap to hire music. there's nothing but chin wag. the cold dreary custard of english chin wag.}
<A>__{whale scans the crowd.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{slim pickings. well, it's early yet. perhaps this is a good time to pay our respects.}
<A>__{clay follows whale toward a trellis alcove covered in ivy. a handful of people grin at the mismatched couple who stand in the shade: a homely older man in glasses and a pretty woman in a white dress with polka dots. george cukor and}
<B>__{princess margaret.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{let's get this over with quickly.}
<A>__{whale forgets to remove his hat when he comes forward. before he can give cukor their names princess margaret's polite smile bursts open in a joyful display of teeth.}
<C>__{princess margaret}
<D>__{i had no idea you'd be here.}
<A>__{she seizes whale's hand in her little white gloves.}
<C>__{princess margaret}
<D>__{how are you?}
<C>__{whale}
<P>__{(taken aback)}
<D>__{fine. quite fine. and your royal highness?}
<C>__{princess margaret}
<D>__{splendid. now that i know you're around.}
<A>__{standing beside him, clay is clearly impressed that whale knows a princess.}
<C>__{princess margaret}
<D>__{can we get together while i'm in town? i so badly want to sit for you again.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{sit?}
<C>__{princess margaret}
<D>__{i've changed my hair, you see. since our last session. those old snaps look rather dowdy now.}
<A>__{whale realizes she's mistaken him for someone else. he tugs his sunglasses down his nose so she can see his eyes.}
<C>__{princess margaret}
<D>__{oh dear. have i made a blunder?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{ma'am, the pleasure is all mine. james whale.}
<C>__{princess margaret}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i am such a goose. i mistook you for cecil beaton. it's the hat. you're wearing one of cecil's hats, you know.}
<A>__{whale attempts to chuckle while he fights a feeling of humiliation. he turns to cukor for help.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{hello, george. james whale. david lewis's friend. i once made pictures myself, ma'am.}
<C>__{george cukor}
<D>__{yes. of course. one can't throw a rock in this town without hitting one of us old movie directors.}
<A>__{whale feels the sting. he turns to clay.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{ma'am, may i present mr. clayton boone?}
<A>__{clay steps forward to shake hands.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{my gardener, who insisted i bring him today. he so wanted to meet royalty.}
<A>__{cukor's face goes blank with indignation.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{pleased to meet you.}
<C>__{princess margaret}
<D>__{quite. i adore gardens.}
<A>__{whale narrows his eyes at cukor and sharpens his smile.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{he's never met a princess. only queens.}
<A>__{cukor puffs out his chest, quivers a bulbous lower lip at whale.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{george, ma'am, this has been an honor. an occasion to remember for the rest of my days.}
<A>__{he leads clay away and an american couple promptly crowd in to take their place. striding through the garden, whale is obviously pleased with himself.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{what was that about?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{nothing of importance. just two old men slapping each other with lilies. shall we have a drink?}
<A>__{whale leads clay to a tented bar. across the way, david lewis has come through the gate with a woman on his arm. people look discreetly, not at david but at the woman, lightly veiled in a scarf and sunglasses.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{who's that?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{david. the friend i thought was in new york.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{no. the girl.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{girl? oh. elizabeth taylor.}
<A>__{clay watches in amazement as elizabeth taylor waves to someone and pipes out a happy hello. she hurriedly unties her scarf, thrusts it at david and runs off on tiptoes to embrace a woman.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{is that really her?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{david produced her last picture.}
<A>__{david glances around while he slips the scarf into a coat pocket. he sees whale looking at him. he puts on a tight smile and strolls across the patio.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{just what i was about to ask you. i thought you were in new york.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i was, until last night. publicity asked me to fly miss taylor in for today's reception.}
<A>__{the waiter arrives with their drinks. only when clay takes his glass of beer does david see that whale is not alone.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{david lewis.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{clay boone.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{our yardman. who was kind enough to serve as my escort to george's little do.}
<A>__{david freezes. whale lifts his martini glass at clay and takes a sip.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{should you be drinking in your condition?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{oh, david, stop being a nanny.}
<A>__{clay clears his throat, eager to escape this domestic squabble.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i think i will go look at elizabeth taylor.}
<A>__{he hurries off.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you should have seen georgie's face when he met clayton.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you didn't, jimmy.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i did. but princess margaret was a doll. we're all equals in her eyes. as commoners, i presume.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you only embarrass yourself.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{oh dear. i will never work in this town again?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you know what i mean. your reputation.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{but i have no reputation. i'm as free as the air.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{well the rest of us aren't. can't you remember that?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{no. i never could. you must regret having had the invitation sent.}
<A>__{david is looking over whale's shoulder.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i didn't ask george to invite you.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{then who did?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{jimmy, there are people here i need to speak to. you'll be fine on your own?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{yes. perfectly.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{all right, then. i will come by tomorrow for breakfast.}
<A>__{whale nods, watches david stroll over to the pool and greet a gaggle of executives. whale drifts toward some deck chairs at the far end of the croquet lawn. he sits, takes a sip of his drink. suddenly a high pitched giggle pierces the air.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{mr. whale!}
<A>__{whale looks out to see edmund kay, his interviewer from several weeks ago, marching across the lawn.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{mr....kay?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{bet you thought you'd never see me again. i didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you didn't?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{i'm the one who got you on mr. cukor's guest list.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you, mr. kay? how do you know george cukor?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{i interviewed him after i met you. i'm his social secretary now. well, assistant to his secretary.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i commend you. if you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you. you waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{don't think that, mr. whale. i love your movies. that's why i wanted you to come to this. so i could see you with your monsters.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{my monsters?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{don't go away.}
<A>__{whale tries to do just that, but finds himself caught in the chair. he is stumbling to his feet when kay returns with elsa lanchester, 55, at his side.}
<C>__{elsa lanchester}
<D>__{jimmy. how are you?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{elsa?}
<A>__{she takes whale's hand, with a look of deep concern and sympathy. kay races off again.}
<C>__{elsa lanchester}
<D>__{i saw una o'conner a few weeks ago. she said you'd been under the weather.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{oh, nothing out of the ordinary. growing old.}
<C>__{elsa lanchester}
<D>__{we're all getting a bit long in the tooth.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{but you appear quite fresh, my dear.}
<A>__{she swats aside the compliment and gestures at the chair.}
<C>__{elsa lanchester}
<D>__{please. you shouldn't stand on my account.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{perfectly all right. but if you'd like to sit }
<C>__{elsa lanchester}
<D>__{i'm fine, jimmy. i can only stay a few minutes.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{elsa lanchester}
<D>__{what's our pesky friend up to now?}
<A>__{kay returns, accompanied by a stopped, gray haired man with a long rectangular face and wary, heavy lidded eyes.}
<C>__{elsa lanchester}
<D>__{is that boris? our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{oh dear.}
<A>__{karloff, age 70, comes reluctantly, followed by his niece alice, a bashful young woman who carried a blanket wrapped bundle.}
<C>__{elsa lanchester}
<D>__{boris, darling. i didn't know you were here. these public revels are hardly up your alley.}
<C>__{boris karloff}
<D>__{i came for the sake of my visiting niece. alice. and miranda, my great niece.}
<A>__{his huge hand lifts the blanket in alice's arms, revealing a bald infant with enormous blue eyes. karloff gurgles and coos at the child.}
<C>__{elsa lanchester}
<D>__{and what do you make of our royal visitant?}
<C>__{boris karloff}
<D>__{perfectly charming. a real lady.}
<C>__{elsa lanchester}
<D>__{of course she's a lady. what did you expect? a hussy in tennis shoes?}
<A>__{whale looks up and discovers clay standing a few feet behind karloff. he is ogling two bosomy actresses who are listening intently to the monocled british consul. whale's eyes try to focus karloff and clay together, his once and future monsters. kay shouts to a passing photographer carrying a bulky speed graphic.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{hey, you! with the camera! we got a historical moment here. come get a picture of it.}
<A>__{the man scans the scene for a famous face.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{this is mr. james whale, who made "frankenstein" and "bride of frankenstein." and this is the monster and his bride.}
<A>__{clay looks up when he hears kay identify karloff.}
<C>__{photographer}
<D>__{oh, karloff. right.}
<A>__{karloff and elsa drift into position next to whale. the flash goes off, a snap and a crunch of light. whale cringes in pain.}
<C>__{elsa lanchester}
<P>__{(through clenched teeth)}
<D>__{don't you just love being famous?}
<A>__{another flash. from whale's perspective, the bulb resembles nothing so much as the translucent tube of electrical current from dr. frankenstein's laboratory. whale concentrates on his smile as another snap of light stabs his brain. he clutches elsa lanchester's hand.}
<C>__{elsa lanchester}
<D>__{are you all right, jimmy?}
<A>__{a sharp nod from whale. the photographer motions to karloff's niece.}
<C>__{photographer}
<D>__{let me get one with frankenstein holding the kid.}
<A>__{alice hands over the baby. karloff gently cradles the child. whale stands on his left, elsa on his right. they all smile at the baby, who gurgles and points up. whale follows the baby's gaze to the sky, where a large kite rocks and strains in a furious electrical storm. the camera flashes once, then again.}
<C>__{photographer}
<D>__{got it!}
<A>__{whale glances up the kite is gone. thunder rumbles as the group starts to disperse. whale nods to the faces exchanging good byes.}
<C>__{boris karloff}
<D>__{so good to see you again, james.}
<A>__{he strolls off, clucking and cooing at his baby.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{catch you before you go, mr. whale. i will make sure everybody gets sent a printerior}
<A>__{he goes off with the photographer. elsa kisses whale on the cheek.}
<C>__{elsa lanchester}
<D>__{we'll be in touch, jimmy.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{good bye. so nice to see you...}
<A>__{finally whale is alone. he staggers to the deck chair and lowers himself sideways into the lawn chair.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{whale gazes up at clay.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{tired. a bit tired.}
<A>__{clay nods. whale smiles at him.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{are you enjoying yourself?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{actually, no. i feel a little out of place.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{neither of us really belongs here.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{must have been funny for you. seeing your monsters again.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{monsters? the only monsters...}
<P>__{(closes his eyes)}
<D>__{...are here.}
<A>__{across the lawn, conversation has stopped. birdlike shrieks come from all directions.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{oh fuck. and we left the top down. you want to run for it?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{run for what?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{can't you see? it's raining!}
<A>__{the rain is only a flickering of air, but people are jumping and shrieking, throwing coats over their heads as they dash toward the house.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{he takes whale under the arm, helps him up and escorts him to a small tent. on the patio, everyone shoves and squeezes to get through the one open door. whale stares out, hypnotized by the deluge. from his pov, we see a young man step into the rain. whale squints, is finally able to identify the man as leonard barnett. whale's eyes follow barnett as he emerges onto a new landscape, a scarred and barren battlefield. as the storm continues to rage:}
<C>__{clay }
<D>__{mr. whale?}
<A>__{whale shifts his gaze to clay. he takes a moment to orient himself.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{let's get out of this funk hole}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you don't want to wait it out? rain should let up soon.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{we're not sugar. we won't melt.}
<A>__{whale adjusts the brim of his hat and steps into the downpour. clay has no choice except to follow. they walk briskly, the minute splashes on whale's hat forming a ghostly aura of spray.}
