<A>__{watts slips inside and locks the door behind her. turns, holding her stomach. moves across the suite to the med pod. she thumbs the machine out of stand by mode. its screen fills with menu items. bewildering. watts finds and touches a red button labeled emergency. a new, simpler list. watts scans it frantically.}

<P>__{(under her breath)}
<D>__{come on...i need a caesarean.}
<A>__{a spasm of agony curls her into a ball on the carpet. she throttles her scream into a hiss of air. watts struggles up to her knees, drenched in sweat and shaking. one hand clamped over her mouth, elbow tucked against her ribs. with the other hand she taps options...}
<B>__{surgery ... exploratory ... abdominal ... penetrating injuries ... foreign body ... initiate}
<A>__{the med pod opens with a hiss. watts strips off her clothes. struggling with fastenings under a new wave of pain. her hands shaking. she's barely keeping her feet. she clutches the frame of the med pod in a death grip. it's happening. naked she staggers into the pod. hits initiate. the surgical apparatus swings into place. scalpels, forceps, scopes and suction tubes. a spraygun mists her torso with yellow antiseptic. the clear canopy descends over her. watts screams. a wail of indescribable agony. an armored parasite erupts from the deepening incision. its needle toothed maw snarls through a fountain of blood. arterial blood sprays the inside of the canopy. the parasite slithers out of her. drops to the floor of the pod: a pale serpent with a demon's skull. it has a hard brow, a horny hide. very different from the soft white worm that holloway gave birth to. it drops to the floor, thrashing and hissing in fury at its confinement. watts convulses. her eyes roll back. in shock. dying. the parasite tears through the grille of the drain. escapes out into vickers's cabin. in the pod, scanning beams and sensors probe watts's horrific wound. a nightmare list scrolls across the pod's screen:}
<B>__{collapsed left lung punctured right ventricle perforated stomach ruptured spleen gross muscular trauma...}
<A>__{manipulators plunge lines into her veins recharging her body with artificial blood. an oxygen tube slips down her throat. an epidural into her spine. watts moans around her tracheal tube. her eyes flutter open.}
<C>__{watts's pov}
<A>__{through the blood spattered glass, she sees the parasite slither across vickers's bed, tracking blood on the sheets.}
<C>__{on watts}
<A>__{as she slips into unconsciousness. head lolling. time passes. manipulators reach into her wound. re positioning organs. suturing ravaged flesh. a nozzle sprays antiseptic sealant. hours grind by in bloody labor. watts's eyes snap open.}
<C>__{watts's pov}
<A>__{vigoda breaks into the cabin, a gun in his hand. he scowls at the bloody track on the bed and then freezes, seeing watts inside the med pod, a vivisected woman. the autosurgeon hard at work. the parasite crawls into view behind vigoda. it has already trebled in size. he does not see it before it leaps at him. he dies in seconds. his throat ripped open. lies staring at nothing. his submachine gun lies beside him. watts's body jerks as manipulators tug and sew at her guts. she stares at the dead man in a fog of horror. the parasite's skin splits, spraying the carpet with acid. limbs erupt from its shoulders and haunches. spines from its back. metamorphosis. with a crack of carapace, its head swings down from its serpentine position. it becomes a devil with an lethal, elongated skull. an alien. the alien turns its head. looks at watts inside the med pod. her breath catches. she passes out.}
