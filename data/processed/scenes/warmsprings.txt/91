<A>__{franklin is in the pool with the new guests. they are all nervously waiting to test the water. from the looks on their faces it's clear they only want to take their cues from franklin. a mother carries her adorable 4 year old girl into the water.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{and who is this delightful child?}
<C>__{daisy}
<P>__{(giggling)}
<D>__{daisy.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{all right daisy, try and kick your legs.}
<A>__{daisy wiggles back and forth in her mother's arms giving it her very best effort.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{excellent, daisy!}
<A>__{jake perrini, 32, bronx born with an upper body of steel wheels over to roy who is fixing a wheelchair.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{jake perrini, bronx, new york.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{roy, sir.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{how you doin'?}
<A>__{jake reaches out his hand to shake. roy is unsure what to do.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{c'mon i won't bite.}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(shaking his hand)}
<D>__{mighty fine, sir. mighty fine.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{hey, would you mind pulling me outta this trap, roy? i wanna get airborne.}
<A>__{roy gently lifts jake up and out of his chair, into his arms like a child.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{do me one more favor? throw me in?}
<A>__{roy tosses jake to the heavens and he sails through the air emitting a jungle cry of pure emotional release before splashing down hard in the water. he bobs up to the surface. there is applause.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{now folks, these exercises are of my own devising so bear with me.}
<A>__{some laugh, some are confused. this is new territory for everyone.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{my hope is that in repeating these movements over and over in the water i'm in some way causing the muscles to regenerate themselves and repair the damage.}
<A>__{he swims to the edge of the pool.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{so everybody grab the edge of the pool and move what you can!}
<A>__{they disperse, eagerly ready to do what franklin tells them.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{go ahead now, do your best!}
<A>__{their legs barely rise up to splash the surface. undeterred, franklin leads them on, spiritedly. in the distance we see tom, leaning against a tree, watching everything.}
