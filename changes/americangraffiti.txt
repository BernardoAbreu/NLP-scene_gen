<ACTION>__{On a dark screen an immense amber light appears and an electric humming begins. The eerie light glows brighter and illuminates a single huge number--11. We hear static and a large vertical band of red floats mysteriously across the screen. Pulling back slowly, we watch the glowing band traverse back and forth over the amber light and past more numbers appearing--}
<LOC>__{70... 90... 110... 130. And we begin to hear voices--strange}
<ACTION>__{songs, fading conversations and snatches of music drifting with static. Pulling back further, we realize it is a car radio filling the screen and radio stations we're hearing, until the indicator stops. There's a pause...and suddenly we are hit by a blasting-out-of-the-past, Rocking and Rolling, turn-up- the-volume, pounding Intro to a Vintage 1962 Golden Week-End Radio Show--back when things were simpler and the music was better. And now a wolf howl shatters through time as the legendary Wolfman Jack hits the airwaves, his gravel voice shrieking and growling while the music pumps and grinds...}

<ACTION>__{The Wolfman howls like a soulful banshee as "Rock Around the Clock" blasts forth. MEL'S DRIVE-IN--DUSK A neon drive-in casts long shadows across a vast parking lot as the sun drops behind a distant hill. A large neon sign buzzes in the foreground... MEL'S DRIVE-IN, while in the background, "Rock Around The Clock" blares from the radio of a beautiful decked and channeled, white with red trim, tuck- and-rolled '58 Chevy Impala that glides into the drive-in. Main titles appear over action. Steve Bolander stops the elegant machine and gets out. He looks around, then walks to the front of the car and leans against the flame-covered hood. Steve is eighteen, good-looking in a conservative, button-down, short-sleeved shirt. Most likely to succeed, president of his graduating class. He looks around the empty drive-in, then hears a funny little horn. A Vespa scooter bumps into the lot. A young kid waves at him-- and suddenly grabs the handlebars again as the scooter nearly topples. Terry Fields ("The Toad") maneuvers the scooter next to Steve's Chevy but misjudges and ricochets off the trash can before stopping. Terry grins sheepishly. He's seventeen, short but plenty loud, both vocally and sartorically in his pink and black shirt, levis, and white bucks. He looks slightly ridiculous but always thinks he's projecting an air of supercool. Steve watches Terry smooth back his shiny ducktail and primp his waterfall to a perfect cascade over his forehead. He unbuttons his shirt one more button and lowers his pants to look tough. Terry walks over and leans against the flamed car, imitating Steve who pays him no mind. In the background, we hear the Wolfman howling with the music. The record ends and a barrage of humor begins from Wolfman Jack. The Wolfman is an unseen companion to all the kids. Witty and knowledgeable about the trivia that counts, he's their best friend, confidant, and guardian angel. Now, a grey, insect-like Citroen deux-chevaux putters into the parking lot and stops on the other side of the lot. Steve and Terry watch Curt Henderson get out. Curt stands by his little car. He's seventeen, a curly bespectacled, scraggly kid with a summer-grown moustache and a paperback stuck in his bermuda shorts. Curt thinks of himself as the town cynic. In reality, he's a hopeless romantic. He starts over to his buddies.}

<DIAL>__{Hey, whadaya say? Curt? Last night in town, you guys gonna have a little bash before you leave?}
<CHAR>__{STEVE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The Moose have been lookin' for you all day, man.}
<ACTION>__{Steve reaches into his pocket and hands Curt an envelope without saying anything. Curt opens it slowly and pulls out a check.}

<CHAR>__{STEVE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Mr. Jenning couldn't find you, so he gave it to me to give to you. He said he's sorry it's so late, but it's the first scholarship the Moose Lodge has given out. Oh yeah, he says they're all very proud of you.}

<DIAL>__{Steve... Ah, I think we'd better have a talk. I've gotten-}
<ACTION>__{Suddenly a horn honks and they all turn. Laurie Henderson pulls into the drive-in and waves to them. She is driving the family's '58 Edsel.}
<CHAR>__{STEVE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Your sister calls. I'll talk to you later.}
<CHAR>__{CURT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{What! Come on, what are you talking about?}
<CHAR>__{CURT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't know. I was thinking I might wait for a year... go to city--}
<ACTION>__{Laurie honks the horn a couple of times. Steve ignores her. There is a long moment and Curt looks uncomfortable.}
<CHAR>__{STEVE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You chicken fink.}
<CHAR>__{CURT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Wait, let me explain--}
<CHAR>__{STEVE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You can't back out now! After all we went through to get accepted. We're finally getting out of this turkey town and now you want to crawl back into your cell--look, I gotta talk to Laurie.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(he hands the check back to Curt)}
<DIAL>__{Now take it. We're leaving in the morning. Okay?}
<ACTION>__{Suddenly, there's an ear-splitting roar and they all turn as a yellow '32 Ford deuce coupe--chopped, lowered and sporting a Hemi-V8--bumps into the lot. The low slung classic rumbles and parks at the rear of the drive in. Big John Milner, twenty-two, sits in his Ford, tough and indifferent, puffing on a Camel. He wears a white T-shirt and a butch haircut molded on the sides into a ducktail. A cowboy in a deuce coupe--simple, sentimental and cocksure of himself.}
<CHAR>__{STEVE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You wanna end up like John? You can't stay seventeen forever.}
<CHAR>__{CURT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I just want some time to think. What's the rush? I'll go next year.}
<CHAR>__{STEVE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We'll talk later.}
<ACTION>__{Steve walks off toward Laurie's Edsel. Laurie gets out. She's wearing a letterman's sweater with a large "Class of '62" emblazoned on the shoulder. Steve goes to her and they hug. On the radio, the music ends, and the Wolfman's intro tune comes on.}

<ACTION>__{MEL'S DRIVE-IN--NIGHT As the radio blares "Sixteen Candles," we see that with the darkness Burger City has come alive. A continual line of hot rods pulls into the parking lot to check out the parked cars, then returns to the maindrag. Carhops glide by on roller skates. Curt and John are fooling around in front of the deuce coupe. A horn honks and they turn as a '60 Ford with three girls in it slows by them. A girl leans out the window and smiles.}
<CHAR>__{GIRL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hi John!}
<ACTION>__{The girls in the car all screech and giggle as they zoom off.}
<CHAR>__{JOHN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Not too good, huh?}
<CHAR>__{CURT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Why is it every girl that comes around here is ugly? Or has a boyfriend? Where is the dazzling beauty I've been searching for all my life?}
<ACTION>__{John watches the procession of gleaming cars traveling through the hot night.}
<CHAR>__{JOHN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I know what you mean. The pickin's are really gettin' slim. The whole strip is shrinking. Ah, you know, I remember about five years ago, take you a couple of hours and a tank full of gas just to make one circuit. It was really somethin.'}
<ACTION>__{Suddenly, in the distance, there's a blood-curdling scream from an incredible high-performance engine. The entire drive- in stops and listens.}
<CHAR>__{CURT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hey, John. Someone new in town.}
<CHAR>__{JOHN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Ahhh.}
<CHAR>__{CURT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You gonna go after him?}
<CHAR>__{JOHN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hey, listen, Professor, if he can't find me, then he ain't worth racin', right?}
<CHAR>__{CURT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The big shot!}
<ACTION>__{Across the swarming parking lot, Steve sits in the front seat of his chevy with Laurie. Budda Macrae, a car hop, leans down to attach a tray to Steve's window, showing off her tight blouse.}
<CHAR>__{BUDDA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{A cherry-vanilla coke and a chocolate mountain. Anything else you want, Steve?}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(Steve shakes his head.)}
<DIAL>__{If there is you let me know now. Just honk and I'm yours.}
<ACTION>__{She tucks in her blouse a little tighter, gives him a hot look and goes to get the other tray. Budda takes the other tray around the car, almost shoves it in the window where Laurie is sitting.}
<CHAR>__{BUDDA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{One fries--grab it before I drop it.}
<ACTION>__{She gives Laurie an antagonistic look and goes off. Steve laughs. Laurie smiles. She's seventeen, very pretty, with big doe-eyes, and a short bobbed hairdo. She pushes up the sleeves on Steve's letterman sweater, which is sizes too large for her. His class ring glints on a chain around her neck. Laurie is sweet, the image of vulnerability, but with a practical and self-preserving mind beneath.}
<CHAR>__{STEVE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Where was I?}
<CHAR>__{LAURIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Um, how you thought high school romances were goofy and we started going together just because you thought I was kinda cute and funny, but then you suddenly realized you were in love with me, it was serious... and ah... oh, you were leadin' up to somethin' kinda big.}
<CHAR>__{STEVE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You make it sound like I'm giving dictation. Well, seriously, what I meant was, that ah... since we do care for each other so much, and since we should really consider ourselves as adults. Now, I, ah... could I have a couple of those fries?}
<ACTION>__{Through the windshield of the Chevy, they see Terry run by in front of them, chasing Budda Macrae who's outdistancing him on her roller skates.}
<TRANS>__{TERRY:}
<DIAL>__{Come on, Budda. Come on...}
<ACTION>__{Steve watches them go by, then looks back at Laurie.}
<CHAR>__{STEVE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Ah, where was I?}
<CHAR>__{LAURIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{..."consider ourselves adults"...}
<ACTION>__{Laurie pretends to be interested in her french fries, but is obviously expecting something big.}
<CHAR>__{STEVE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Right... right... anyway, I thought maybe, before I leave, we could ah... agree that... that seeing other people while I'm away can't possibly hurt, you know?}
<ACTION>__{Laurie hasn't looked up but her mood has changed like a mask.}
<CHAR>__{LAURIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You mean dating other people?}
<CHAR>__{STEVE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I think it would strengthen our relationship. Then we'd know for sure that we're really in love. Not that there's any doubt.}
<ACTION>__{Steve smiles and then looks to her. He stops smiling. They listen to the radio for an awkward moment. Laurie struggles to hold back her tears. With obvious difficulty, she turns to him and smiles. He's expected something different and doesn't know what to do, so he smiles back.}
<CHAR>__{LAURIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I think you're right. I mean, we're not kids anymore, and it's silly to think that when we're three thousand miles apart we shouldn't be able to see other people and go out.}
<ACTION>__{Laurie takes his ring on the chain from around her neck and puts it in her purse.}
<CHAR>__{STEVE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Laurie, now, listen, I didn't ask for that back. I think that...}
<CHAR>__{LAURIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I know. I just sort of think it's juvenile now. I'll keep it at home. It's less conspicuous there.}
<CHAR>__{STEVE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You don't want to wear it?}
<CHAR>__{LAURIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I didn't say that. I understand and I'm not upset. I mean, I can't expect you to be a monk or something while you're away.}
<ACTION>__{Steve just looks at her and nods. The Wolfman howls an intro to "Gee" by the Crows. Outside, skooting around the drive-in after Budda, Terry is pleading with the sexy car hop as she delivers a tray to a car.}
<CHAR>__{TERRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{...and I have a really sharp record collection. I even have "Pledging My Love" by Johnny Ace. Anyway, how can you love Nelson when he's going out with Marilyn Gator. Since he dumped on you maybe we could--}
<CHAR>__{BUDDA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{He didn't dump on me, you little dip. Hi, Steve!}
<ACTION>__{Her tone changes immediately. Terry looks sour and turns around to Steve who's getting out of the chevy. Budda leaves, wiggling her butt for Steve.}
<CHAR>__{TERRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{She's a little conceited--just playing hard to get.}
<CHAR>__{STEVE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Listen, I came over here to talk to you about--}
<CHAR>__{TERRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Any time, buddy. I'm your man. Nothing I like better than chewing the rug with a pal. You talk, I'll listen. I'm all ears. Shoot.}
<CHAR>__{STEVE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Shut up.}
<CHAR>__{TERRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sure.}
<CHAR>__{STEVE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Terry, I'm going to let you take care of my car while we're away--at least until Christmas. I'm afraid if I leave it with my--}
<ACTION>__{Steve notices Terry isn't with him any more and turns. Terry is standing frozen to a spot.}
<CHAR>__{STEVE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What's wrong?}
<ACTION>__{Terry tries to talk, much like a shell-shocked war veteran. His mouth moves but only a gurgle comes out. Curt is standing by the Chevy, talking with his sister Laurie. She's still upset by what Steve said to her.}
<CHAR>__{CURT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hey, sis--what's wrong?}
<CHAR>__{LAURIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Nothing.}
<ACTION>__{Meanwhile, they watch Terry as Steve explains to him about the car.}
<CHAR>__{STEVE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Now listen, only 30 weight Castrol- R. I've written the tire pressure and stuff on a pad in the glove compartment. Are you listening?}
<ACTION>__{The others are watching now as Terry shakes his head mechanically.}
<CHAR>__{CURT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What's wrong, he's crying!}
<ACTION>__{There is indeed a tear rolling down Terry's cheek.}
<CHAR>__{TERRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I can't... believe... it.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(He starts toward the}
<DIAL>__{car and gently}
<DIAL_PAR>__{caresses its paint.)}
<DIAL>__{I don't know what to say. I'll... love and protect this car until death do us part.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(He circles the car.)}
<DIAL>__{This is a superfine machine. This may even be better than Daryl Starbird's superfleck moonbird. It is better than Daryl Starbird's.}
<ACTION>__{Laurie watches Terry, realizing that like the car, she'll be left behind as a fond memory. She turns and looks at Steve, who's been watching her. There's a moment between them... Budda comes by with an empty tray. Terry sees her and wipes his eyes. He walks up to her, a strange look on his face.}
<CHAR>__{TERRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Budda, how would you like to go to the drive-in movies with me?}
<ACTION>__{The idea is so preposterous that even Budda is speechless. She looks around at others.}
<CHAR>__{BUDDA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You've got to be kidding!}
<CHAR>__{TERRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Would I kid you about a thing like that? I want you to know that something has happened to me tonight that is going to change everything. I've got a new...}
<ACTION>__{John walks up quietly and casually pulls down hard on the back pockets of Terry's low riding levis. There is general hysteria as Terry quickly pulls up his pants.}
<CHAR>__{TERRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Car!! All right, who's the wise--}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(He turns and sees}
<DIAL>__{John and changes his}
<DIAL_PAR>__{tune.)}
<DIAL>__{Oh, John--verrry funny.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(He tries to laugh with the others.)}
<CHAR>__{JOHN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hey, did she do that to you?}
<CHAR>__{STEVE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Let's get going. It seems like we've spent most of our lives in this parking lot.}
<CHAR>__{TERRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hey, Curt, let's bomb around, I wanna try out my new wheels!}
<CHAR>__{CURT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'd like to, Toad, but I'm going with Steve and Laurie to the hop. I'd just slow you down anyway.}
<CHAR>__{TERRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, tonight things are going to be different.}
<CHAR>__{JOHN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hey, wait a minute, you're goin' to the Hop? The Freshman Hop?}

<DIAL>__{Yeah.}

<CHAR>__{JOHN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, yeah... Well, listen. You go. Go ahead, Curtsy, baby. You go on over there and you remember all the good times you won't be having. I ain't goin' off to some goddamned fancy college. I'm stayin' right here. Havin' fun, as usual.}
<ACTION>__{John walks angrily to his coupe, gets in and slams the door. Curt looks at the others and shrugs.}
<CHAR>__{TERRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Jesus, Milner, you're in a great mood tonight.}
<ACTION>__{Curt goes over and stands by the window of the yellow coupe.}

<ACTION>__{John roars his engine and pulls the yellow deuce coupe into a screeching take-off out of the drive-in. Terry and Curt watch him go off. MAIN STREET, MODESTO-NIGHT During the day, G street is a line of used car lots, small shops, tacky department stores and greasy spoons. At night, it is transformed into an endless parade of kids in flamed, lowered and customed machines who rumble down the one way street, through the seemingly adultless, heat-drugged little town. Police cars glide ominously with the flow of traffic. In parked cars, couples neck between flashing headlights. Guys looking cool in a '56 Chevy sit in the slouched position of the true Low Rider--and over it all the music and the Wolfman can be heard. Just now, it's "Runaway" by Del Shannon. John travels with the flow of traffic, watching some dopey guys shooting squirt guns from a moving car. John drives the deuce coupe effortlessly. He looks over at a car pacing alongside of his own.}

<ACTION>__{John nods and the two cars pull apart down the street. TRAVELING G STREET-STEVE'S WHITE '58 CHEVY The Rock and Roll blares as Terry the Toad cruises along the main drag, singing along with the music. Sitting low in his seat, he looks around, his face aglow, experiencing a new world from the inside of a really fine car. This is the greatest thing that has happened to Terry in seventeen long years of being a short loser. Terry turns a corner and another car pulls alongside. A guy looks out the window.}
<CHAR>__{GUY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(Terry nods modestly)}
<DIAL>__{Geez, what a waste of machinery.}
<ACTION>__{Terry's smile changes to a scowl as the car pulls away from him.. Terry accounts the slight to jealousy. Then he forgets it and enjoys driving the beautiful Chevy again. Another car pulls alongside of him as he cruises along slowly.}
<CHAR>__{GIRL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hey, kid.}
<ACTION>__{Terry looks over at the car cruising next to him. In the back seat, a guy has dropped his trousers and is pushing his bare buttocks against the side window--a classic BA complete with pressed ham. Terry looks away, wondering why this is still happening to him, even in his new car. TRAVELING G STREET-LAURIE'S '58 EDSEL Curt is in the back seat gazing out the window at the dark main street of the small farm community. Steve and Laurie are talking quietly in the front seat. Laurie is sitting near the window and it sounds like Steve is convincing her to move over. Laurie finally does. His arm goes around her and her head rests on his shoulder. Curt is laughing as the Wolfman harasses someone on the radio. The Wolfman is placing a call.}

In the cop car, Holstein thinks he hears something. He opens the door and gets out. Adjusting his billy club, he paces around the used car lot officiously, while Curt hides behind a Falcon and peeks out from behind a fender. He sees Holstein walking back toward the squad car. The cop opens the door again and climbs in. The echoing sound of the calls coming over the police radio blend with the Wolfman's howling as cars pass with their radios blaring. Curt is inching forward with the cable, toward the squad car. In the background, a slow freight train can be heard starting to move across the valley. Curt ties the cable to a post and then, looking scared, crawls under the police car with the cable. Underneath the car, Curt inches on his back and then reaches up and attaches the cable to the rear axle of the car.}

OUTSIDE RADIO STATION--CITROEN The little Citroen bumps along a lonely dirt road, winding its way through dark peach orchards and wizened grape vineyards. Curt watches the deserted landscape when suddenly, the radio increases in volume and he turns it down. Then it begins to roar and distort eerily as the signal becomes more powerful. Then Curt sees it. He stops the car and gets out. He stands looking at an isolated white frame house hitting in the moonlight. Curt looks up at a spidery radio antenna that rises toward the stars, its black wires humming in the stillness. Curt starts up the gravel walk to the door. Under the glare of a naked spotlight, he sees a small intercom which plays soft Rock and Roll. He hesitates, then pushes a buzzer. He pushes it again and finally a voice comes over the intercom.}

Curt goes through this other-worldly maze until he comes to a small, dimly lit control booth. A figure inside is barely visible through the reflections in the double glass windows. The figure turns and walks up to the window. Curt backs off a bit. A face stares at him--long hair greased in a ducktail, a short chinbeard. Then he speaks, his voice filtering strangely through a hidden speaker.}

And well--I'll tell you this much--the Wolfman does come in here now and then, with tapes, to check up on me, you know, and when I hear the stories he got about the places he goes. Hell, here I sit while there's a big beautiful world out there, don't ya know.

PARADISE ROAD--DAWN John's '32 yellow deuce coupe and Falfa's black '55 Chevy are waiting side by side on a long, straight country road, their front wheels resting on a weather-beaten starting line. The sky is getting lighter as the radio plays "Green Onions." There are about six to eight other cars parked off the road to watch the race. Everything is quiet now, only the crickets ignoring the solemnity of the scene, and still singing.

Both cars roar off the starting line, tires smoking and screaming. Terry has his hands over his head and is coughing in a cloud of smoke as they pass. John beats Falfa off the line. Out on the road, as they hit third gear, the cars are almost neck and neck. Inside Falfa's car, Laurie looks scared to death. Falfa looks insane as he tromps it. John hits fourth at about eighty-five. Falfa does likewise-- but starts to fish-tail. Laurie closes her eyes, almost crying-- Falfa regains control nervously. Falfa's engine is winding out incredibly and he begins to get the edge on John. The cars rocket through the dawn light along the flashing white line until suddenly Falfa's car blows a tire, his front wheel slips off and the car shoots off into a tomato field, hits an irrigation ditch and begins flipping over wildly in a horrifying cloud of dust and smoke-- John sees the Chevy leaving the road and screams to a halt, swimming through an unbelievable U-turn and high tailing it back to the crash site. He is out of the car like a bullet, running across the dirty cloddy field. The crash car is beginning to burn in the engine compartment and John is panicked. Meanwhile, the spectators have arrived, including Steve, who jumps from his car and is running across the field. Steve and John arrive at the fire at approximately the same time.

<DIAL>__{Who are you? How do you know me?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's not important.}
<CHAR>__{CURT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(excitedly)}
<DIAL>__{It's important to me. You're the most perfect, beautiful creature I've ever seen and I don't know anything about you. Could we meet someplace?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I cruise Third Street every night. Maybe I'll see you again tonight.}
<CHAR>__{CURT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No... I don't think so.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Why?}
<CHAR>__{CURT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm leaving... in a couple of hours. Where are you from?}

<DIAL>__{Curt...}
<CHAR>__{CURT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What's your name? At least tell me your name?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Goodbye, Curt.}
<CHAR>__{CURT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Wait a second! Wait a second!}
<ACTION>__{But there's a click as she hangs up. Curt looks at the phone a moment, then also hangs up. From the car radio, he hears the Wolfman making kissing noises.}
<CHAR>__{WOLFMAN } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{Little kiss on your ear. Good night, sweetheart. I'll see you later.}
<ACTION>__{And then the Spaniels duh-duh-duh-duh-duh into "Goodnight Sweetheart."}
<ACTION_ALT>__{AIRPORT DAY}
<ACTION>__{A DC-3 prop airliner is warming up its engines as it waits to take off from a small country airport. There aren't too many people around. Just Curt and his friends and family seeing him off. Curt stands with a kindly-looking couple in their fifties. He hugs his mother and shakes hands with his dad. Then, Curt moves to his friends. He shakes Steve's hand.}
<CHAR>__{STEVE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Good luck.}
<CHAR>__{CURT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, same to you. And I better see you there next year.}
<CHAR>__{STEVE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh yeah, I'll be there.}
<CHAR>__{CURT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sure.}
<ACTION>__{Curt hugs his sister. Laurie holds on to him for a moment.}
<CHAR>__{CURT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{See ya later.}
<CHAR>__{LAURIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{'Bye 'bye, Curt.}
<ACTION>__{Curt goes to Terry and John.}
<CHAR>__{CURT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{So long, guys.}
<CHAR>__{TERRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, stay cool, man.}
<CHAR>__{CURT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah.}
<CHAR>__{TERRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Ah--don't do anything I wouldn't do.}
<ACTION>__{Curt smiles at Terry, who has a bandage on his forehead. Curt looks at John and they don't seem to know what to say. Finally, John gives Curt a little slap on the cheek.}
<CHAR>__{CURT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'll see ya, buddy.}
<CHAR>__{JOHN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I know, you probably think you're a big shot, goin' off like this--but you're still a punk.}
<CHAR>__{CURT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Okay, John. So long.}
<ACTION>__{He walks toward the plane and they all wave. He looks around as he goes up the steps carrying a small bag and a portable radio. The stewardess smiles as he passes her. Above the door of the plane it reads RADAR EQUIPPED. Curt looks back again, then goes inside. The plane takes off down the runway and then climbs up into the sky.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{INSIDE THE PLANE}
<ACTION>__{Curt listens to the radio as the plane takes off. It's playing "Goodnight Sweetheart." As the plane climbs and banks over the valley, the music fades and the station drifts between static and other stations...and then it's gone. Curt turns off the radio and looks out the window. As the plane banks, through the window Curt sees the white Thunderbird crossing beneath on the small grey ribbon of highway. Curt watches it. Then the plane's shadow ripples over the car and it, too, is gone.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{THE BLUE SKY}
<ACTION>__{As the plane flies off against the blue sky we see cameos of Curt and his friends: John Milner was killed by a drunk driver in December 1964. Terry Fields was reported missing in action near An Loc in December 1965. Steve Bolander is an insurance agent in Modesto, California. Curt Henderson is a writer living in Canada.}
