<A>__{activity of cars and taxis arriving and discharging passengers with luggage, busy redcaps, etcetera. we focus on a taxi pulling up and stopping, the driver hands out modest looking luggage, including a bunch of tennis rackets in cases to a redcap. camera pans down as the passenger gets out of the taxi so that we see only his shoes and the lower part of his trousers. he is wearing dark colored brogues and a conservative suit apparently. the feet move toward, the entrance to the station and out of scene. immediately a chauffeur driven limousine drives up and an expensive place of airplane luggage is handed out of this, and the passenger alighting from the back is seen to be wearing black and white sport shoes which, as before, are all we see of him. the sport shoes start off in the wake of the brogues.}
