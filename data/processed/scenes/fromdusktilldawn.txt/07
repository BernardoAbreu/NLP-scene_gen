<A>__{the plymouth tears ass across texas plains. as titles play over, we see seth and richard enjoying their getaway road trip. seth behind the wheel, pops open a bottle of prescription pills, empties out four of the red capsules in his hand, pops them in his mouth, and washes it back with a slug of jack daniel's from a pint bottle. richard looks at seth through the hole in his hand. like a boxer, richard wraps his wounded hand with gaffer's tape. the camera leaves the boys, as they woosh down the street, and goes along the length of the car to the trunk. it hangs on the trunk. then we see through the trunk, like superman: an older woman tied up and helpless in the trunk. the rest of the titles play over black as the song continues.}
