<L>__{interior sam's flat night}
<A>__{sam enters, followed by jill. his breath immediately starts come out of his mouth like clouds of steam. the flat looks as though it has been disembowelled and then deep frozen. icicles are hanging down from everywhere. the flat looks like a scrap dump. every wall has spilled out its disgusting steel and rubber entrails, filling most of the available space and making progress through the flat difficult. half a dozen men are at work. they are impossible to identify because they wear arctic clothing and look more like spacemen. their voices however belong to spoor and dowser.}
