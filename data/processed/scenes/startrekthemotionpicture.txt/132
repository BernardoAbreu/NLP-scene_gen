<L>__{interior v'ger kirk maneuvering within the chamber}
<A>__{kirk but a small object, thruster jets occasionally spurting as he guides himself deeper into the trench as he continues forward progress in the direction he saw spock taking.}
<B>__{closer on kirk}
<A>__{so we can see his face (through the plate), as he looks ahead into the distance toward spock. kirk's pov (o) spock's strobe signal closer and spock's tiny space suited figure now becoming dimly visible as he moves steadily toward the glowing forcefields of the inner wall.}
<B>__{on kirk}
<A>__{his attention fixed on spock, he never notices until an instant too late an o.s. object; quickly he hits a thruster control, and we see the maneuvering jet turn him to the side as: wider angle kirk and the blob formation (o) a swarm of strange looking translucent crystal like forms on a collision course with kirk. (note: they were traveling randomly , and are not deliberate ob structions. however, kirk's nearness now has attracted them and the swarm of them heads in his direction. kirk tries to avoid them; he hits a second maneuvering jet but he overcompensates, and spins straight into the intercepting swarm of them. med. shot kirk (o) as the nearest crystal forms whip into shot, adhering to kirk's spacesuit. he hits full maneuvering jets now, seems to make some escape, but still more forms whip in, adhere.}
