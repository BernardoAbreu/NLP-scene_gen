<A>__{joni tiptoes up a dark staircase and enters an office off the mom's bedroom. she heads for the desk and stealthy opens a drawer. she rummages though with clear intention. she pulls out a folder and studies the cover. we see the words: "pacific cryo clinic: bringing your dreams to life."}
<L>__{interior bedroom moments later}
<A>__{angle on the bed we now only see nic. jules has slipped under the blanket, and is now between nic's legs. we see nic trying to get into it, but having a hard time.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{i don't like the guys in this one. they're too shaved.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{don't focus on it.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{how about the one with the biker gang?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{we left it in hawaii.}
<A>__{jules wrestles with the blankets. wants them out of her way.}
<C>__{nic}
<P>__{(pulling them back up)}
<D>__{i'm cold, honey.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{sorry. i couldn't breathe.}
<A>__{jules wrangles the blankets, trying to cover her partner. the transition is awkward and jules gets caught in the top sheet. as nic repositions herself, she leans on the volume control button and suddenly the porn is blasting at full volume.}
<C>__{man in movie}
<D>__{suck that fat cock mother fucker...}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{shit!! where's the remote?!}
<C>__{man in movie}
<D>__{i'm gonna fuck that tight ass!...}
<A>__{jules and nic both dive for the remote. it's lost under the mass of bedding. they struggle to find it as the grunting and 70's disco music blares.}
