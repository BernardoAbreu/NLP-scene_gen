<L>__{exterior biplane dunes day}
<A>__{the biplane smashes over a dune, rolls over and crashes upside down into another dune. the sand swirls as o'connell falls out of the gunner's compartment. the left wing is jammed into the dune, jonathan hangs upside down.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{excuse me... a little help would be useful... if it's not too much trouble!!}
<A>__{o'connell goes to help jonathan. ardeth ray stumbles over to the gunner's compartment and tears the lewis gun off it's mount. he throws the machine gun over one shoulder, a cartridge belt over the other and staggers away. o'connell and jonathan look into the cockpit. winston havlock is dead. a smile on his face. the plane suddenly starts to move, the sand sinks under their feet, they quickly high tail it away. o'connell, jonathan and ardeth ray make it to some rocks and look back. the biplane, with winston havlock inside, slides away over a dune. o'connell gives it a salute. the plane vanishes over the dune and into the swirling sand... hamunaptra day o'connell, jonathan and ardeth ray come down a ravine in the volcano and look out over the ruins of hamunaptra.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{okay, now what the hell does this horus guy look like?}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{he's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{got it.}
<A>__{hamunaptra stairway day carrying torches, o'connell, jonathan and ardeth ray make their way down a long, winding, narrow staircase. heading into the bowels of the necropolis. a passageway to hell. necropolis day evelyn follows imhotep into the underground cemetery. she stops at the sight of all the big hairy rats scurrying through the mausoleums and over the gravestones. beni shoves his rifle into her back and pushes her forward.}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{keep moving.}
<A>__{evelyn gives him a look.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{you know, nasty little fellows such as yourself, always get their comeuppance.}
<A>__{beni suddenly looks worried.}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{oh yes, always.}
<A>__{beni looks even more worried, he nervously starts chewing on his lip. all three of them walk over the bridge crossing the disgusting detritus moat. evelyn looks down at it, horrified.}
