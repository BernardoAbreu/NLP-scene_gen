<L>__{interior roy's rowhouse kitchen night}
<A>__{sara and patrick, post coital. she's in her robe. he's dressed but they're fooling around as they fix sandwiches. patrick drops down in a chair. sara drops down on his lap.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{what's your favorite flower?}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i don't have a favorite.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{yeah, but if you did...}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i dunno. maybe cymbidiums orchids. they're sort of show boaty but they're pretty.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{what's your favorite color?}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{agua.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{what's your second favorite color?}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{mmm. mauve.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{you're makin' this real hard, sara. those ain't exactly tuxedo colors.}
<A>__{sara swings her legs around, facing him, straddling him.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{nut. what are you talking about?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{i was tryin' to get around to askin' you somethin' but since i'm some sorta nut, you probably wouldn't wanna go to prom with me...}
<A>__{she throws her arms around his neck, kissing him. patrick slides his hands under her robe, cups her breasts. sara responds to him. they are too engrossed in this intimacy to hear the front door opening, to see roy until he walks in and sees them. sara leaps up, closes her robe. patrick doesn't know what to do. he's caught. straight up. red handed. roy's eyes dart between them, settle on and slice into patrick.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{patrick it is patrick, isn't it?}
<P>__{(a small awkward nod)}
<D>__{well, i think you were just leavin'.}
<A>__{patrick stands up. sara grabs his arm defiantly, holds him back.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{why does he have to leave? we're all adults. right?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{he either leaves or i throw his ass out. your call, sara.}
<A>__{patrick jerks his arm free from sara, grabs his jacket off the back of his chair. he back talks roy as he passes him.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{chill, man. i'm goin'. you don't have to come off with all 'at.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{who the hell are you to tell me how to come off? you're in my house alone with my daughter.}
<A>__{it takes everything patrick has to keep walking until he's out the door. it slams behind him. sara marches up to roy, furious.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i hate being your daughter. you ruin everything.}
<A>__{she tries to stomp off. roy kicks a chair in her path. snarls.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{siddown.}
<P>__{(not a request; an order; as she sits)}
<D>__{it's a free country, you can hate me. ain't like that's exactly news. but disrespectin' me, that's where the road ends, sara. i don't want him up here again. i mean it.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{you mean it because he's black.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{don't start that bullshit!}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{why's it bullshit? because you hang with black guys and play jazz and have the hots for angela bassett?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{because he was in my house with his hands all over my daughter!}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{keep telling yourself that. just don't expect me to believe it. i saw how you looked at him. but you didn't see him. well, for your information, he's a straight a student with more heart and guts than you'll ever have!}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{yeah? well, when are you gonna have the guts to say what you really want to say to me, sara?}
<C>__{sara}
<P>__{(screaming at him)}
<D>__{want me to say it? you were a piece of shit husband and you're a piece of shit father! you were never there for mom or for me. you took off and never looked back. so don't talk to me about guts.}
<A>__{not quite the truth, but near enough to sting. it quiets roy down. he regards her with regret and guilt.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{sounds like you have it all figured out.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i have you figured out. you think you can make up all the time you missed, all the things you didn't do? you can't! i'm here because i have to be and it's a goddamned nightmare.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{well, you might as well wake up and get used to it, sara, because that's the way things are sometimes, the way life is.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{how the hell would you know? you've been asleep for the past thirty seven years!}
<A>__{now she does storm off. this time roy lets her. he can't find the words to deny what she's said.}
