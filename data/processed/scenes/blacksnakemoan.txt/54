<A>__{his eyes open. they remain fixed beyond us. the pain in his face is replaced with grave confusion. rae lies on the side of the road. her t shirt and panties are damp from the early morning mist, her face caked with dried blood. her skin is deathly white, her mouth open, her eyes shut and swollen. lazarus carefully steps toward her. he leans down over her face.}
