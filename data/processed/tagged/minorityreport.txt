<C>__{officer}
<D>__{right here, sir.}
<A>__{the officer places the case beside the corpse, and opens the latches. inside the case is a large metallic apparatus: the "coroner." it comes to auto life, and begins to unfold itself it rises crab like, and steps out of its case. except for his mouth, the doctor doesn't move. his projected image stands beside the body, his arms folded behind his back. he is the interface, the way the humans communicate with the crab apparatus.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{hi doc.}
<C>__{holographic doctor}
<D>__{hello, director anderson.}
<A>__{the coroner crab begins to walk the body, which is face down on the floor. it moves slowly, hesitating as it crawls the body's back to insert various razor thin probes and core samplers through the shirt and into the spinal cord.}

<D>__{this a homicide, doc?}
<C>__{holographic doctor}

<A>__{the coroner crab steps away from the body.}
<C>__{holographic doctor}
<D>__{please rotate the corpse to the lateral supine position.}
<A>__{two officers turn the body face up. the crab inches close to probe the face. disconcertingly, it lifts the eyelids, and examines the interior of the mouth, so that for a moment the manipulation makes the corpse seem alive. then the crab moves down the trunk and the legs at last, it comes to a standstill. the holographic doctor closes his eyes as if in thought.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{can you imagine if this was a homicide? who even knows how to hunt down a killer any more?}

<A>__{anderson grips the wheel of his chevy, driving down 1 95. the fact that he can't control his car that the steering wheel has no function, his speed is predetermined, and his direction is guided by satellite is maddening now. from inside the cars that glide along beside him people turn and look curiously at the man who is actually gripping his steering wheel. anderson slams it with his fist. through his windshield anderson sees a four year old boy in the driver's seat of a passing red and black ford. his mother sits in the passenger's seat, blithely reading. the boy mimics anderson, gleefully slams his steering wheel too, then laughs. anderson turns and looks the other way, into the distance, at the "sprawl,' the vast unzoned city attached to washington d.c. you can see it in his face: a man could lose himself in there.}

<A>__{rose looks like she's on fire. anderson wets another towel, wrings it over the sink. lisa takes it, and wipes down rose's face and arms . rose's lips are moving soundlessly. her eyes are shut tight. she begins to writhe in bed.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{jesus christ.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{come on, rose.}
<B>__{anderson looks at his watch}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{one hour. we hold it together for an hour, witwer lives and i'm not a murderer.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{she won't last an hour.}
<A>__{it suddenly looks much worse than that. rose's body contorts horribly and she arches up off the bed. lisa can't control her. anderson reaches for her, wraps her in his arms, trying to hold and comfort her.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{rose!}
<A>__{she begins to wail as she thrashes in his arms.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{he's killed him, anderson!}
<A>__{rose stiffens into a seizure posture, then her body goes slack. anderson eases her back on the bed. he stares at her, stricken. her voice barely leaves her now}
<C>__{rose }
<D>__{you didn't save my brother.}
<A>__{anderson reels at her words.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{did he kill both of them, rose? rose!}
<A>__{rose manages to speak, one last time. her whispered words damn him.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{does it matter, anderson?}
<A>__{anderson rises. looks down at rose. it matters. he starts to move, quickly. lisa takes hold of his arm.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{if you leave this room...}
<A>__{anderson kisses her.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{then i'm a cop, just trying to do hisjob.}
<A>__{he reaches for his duffel bag. when the door closes behind him, rose turns her head slightly and looks. and then her eyes drift closed, as she goes to a place deep within her own mind.}
<L>__{exterior a street the sprawl moments later}
<A>__{he passes by several cars on the street. but they're all auto drive, they won't do him any good. so he smashes a store window within forty five seconds a city police transport zooms up, lights flashing. two city officers leap out of the transport. they approach the smashed in store window, weapons drawn. which is a mistake. anderson rises into view behind them, and sonically blasts a small crater in the sidewalk they are standing on. as they trip and fall, he is already spraying them down with bindfoam. their second mistake is they left the engine running to power the bank of nits tracker lights on the car's hood and roof. anderson screeches off through the choking predawn streets of the sprawl, a beacon of light in the darkness.}
<L>__{interior the lab}
<A>__{the digital clock races through time. witwer reaches his hand up and touches the vanishing numbers. the camera pulls back, and we see dr. resfield and the two technicians bound and gagged in a heap in the corner. and when we see the lab in its entirety, there sprawled on the floor in front of his chair is one of the precog brothers. a small rise of blood comes from a torn place in the back of his skull. the other precog sits very still in his chair. he is still connected to everything his helmet is in place, the tvs drip into him. his eyes are open, and when witwer moves, the precog's eyes follow him. witwer can feel them on him. he turns around.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{is he coming? no? yes? maybe?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i think yes.}
<A>__{the precog looks at him.}
<C>__{witwer }
<D>__{and you think yes.}
<A>__{witwer points to the tv screen, running anderson's murder of witwer. witwer smiles triumphantly.}
<C>__{witwer }
<D>__{infallibly, immutably yes.}
<A>__{the precog looks at him. witwer's smile vanishes, and suddenly strides across the room, and claps his hand over the precog's eyes. then he turns, and stares again at the clock.}
<L>__{exterior the precog engineering lab}
<A>__{three officers stand thirty feet apart in front of the building, facing outward toward the parking lot, weapons cradled in their arms. behind them is a line of yew bushes. as we watch, the officer on the left is yanked off his feet backward into the bushes. several moments pass, and the same thing happens to the officer on the right. the officer guarding the front entrance casually looks right. then he looks hard. he grips his weapon tight, and swings left. no one there, either. anderson drops him hard, from behind. the officer crumples onto the cement. but anderson's not done with him. anderson lifts him up, struggles to drag him forward toward the entrance. anderson holds him upright in place. the man's head lolls backward. which is. perfect for what anderson needs to do. anderson reaches his fingers towards the man's closed eyes. he pulls up on the eyelids. an identiscan over the entrance clicks on and reads the man's eyes. access granted, the doors hiss open. anderson enters the building, dragging the officer with him.}
<L>__{interior the lab}
<A>__{anderson enters the lab. the very building sickens him. what he sees sickens him even more. the remaining precog sits strapped into his chair. witwer sits beside him in the other precog chair, the dead brother at his feet. witwer wears the dead precog's helmet. his hand is in his lap, holding a gun. he grins when anderson appears. he takes off the helmet, drops it on the floor.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{i figured, since i can see the future, too, maybe i could get a little disc action going.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{just kidding.}
<A>__{anderson stares at his old partner. then he looks up at the digital clock. five seventeen am. witwer looks too, then turns back to anderson.}
<C>__{witwer }
<D>__{you find you been doing that a lot this week? looking at clocks?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{three minutes to go.}
<A>__{anderson turns to the tv.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{there's never anything good on, you know?}
<A>__{now witwer smiles.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{there. that's the old paul.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{you're not the old ed. you've lost it.}
<A>__{witwer rises from the chair, the gun in his hand.}
<D>__{witwer you lost it. you went weak in the knees, partner.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{i'm not your partner.}
<A>__{witwer looks at him sadly.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{the air went out of you when frank d'ignazio killed himself.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{he was guilty. i accepted that. witwer no you didn't. the doubts were creeping in on you. the lab trying to engineer more precogs ... malcolm pressuring you to expand ...}
<A>__{witwer reaches out and gently touches the remaining precog brother's cheek.}
<C>__{witwer }
<D>__{belief is the basis of the system. it was your job to be the ultimate believer.}
<A>__{witwer is breathing hard. he lifts a hand and wipes the sweat from his face.}
<C>__{witwer }
<D>__{and when frank died, you faltered. i'm a cop, i see into the hearts of men.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and the thing about you is, you wouldn't have just walked away.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{never been my style.}
<A>__{witwer gives him the flicker of a smile}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{precrime needs to grow. you would have stood in its way. the security panel wouldn't have understood that. what you're capable of. what a bulldog you are.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{look what you've been doing to us all week. amazing. you're the best.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{so you took matters into your own hands.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{i understood the threat. i understood you}
<A>__{anderson looks at the dead precog}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{you killed a precog. you ended the system you wanted to protect.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{wrong. this lab will make more. believe it, paul.}
<A>__{they look at the clock. five nineteen.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{knowing the exact moment of your death it's made you crazy, ed.}
<A>__{witwer looks at the tv. the tv reality is almost in synch with what is happening in the room. witwer lifts his gun and then realizes something is terribly wrong. anderson is standing there before him just as he is on the disc except there is a major difference.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{you sonofabitch!}
<A>__{anderson lifts up both hands}
<C>__{witwer }
<D>__{you didn't bring your gun!}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{that's right. no gun.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{you see?! that's exactly what i'm talking about. you don't believe!}
<A>__{anderson just looks at witwer, raging at him.}
<C>__{witwer }
<D>__{the system is infallible .}
<A>__{anderson doesn't seem to be witwer reaches behind him and pulls a second gun from out of his belt.}
<C>__{witwer }
<D>__{i guess that's why i've always carried two.}
<A>__{he tosses the gun to anderson. it clatters at anderson's feet.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{you can't have it both ways. you don't want to die. that's why you lured me here to kill me first.}
<C>__{anderson }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but it you don't diet the system is flawed, and you couldn't live with that.}
<A>__{witwer shoots him once, in the right thigh. anderson cries out, falls to the concrete floor.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{pick it up}
<A>__{anderson speaks through his teeth anderson it doesn't happen. witwer looks frantically at the tv, at the clock. he reaches over and opens the dripmeter on a piggy back iv feeding into the precog's main line. a thick, yellow fluid begins to flow toward the precog's jugular vein.}
<C>__{witwer }
<D>__{you're killing him, partner.}
<A>__{and what choice, finally, does anderson have? he reaches for the gun.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{let's not do this, ed witwer trains his gun on anderson. anderson trains his gun on witwer.}
<C>__{anderson }
<D>__{oh, ed ...}
<A>__{witwer lowers his gun. and stands there between anderson and the doomed precog. the yellow liquid has almost reached the precog's jugular. anderson shoots witwer, once in the heart. witwer is thrown back across the room, against a wall, beneath the clock. anderson drags himself to the precog, and rips the yellow iv out of the main line. the yellow drips onto the floor, mingling with witwer's red. anderson crawls to his friend, and cradles him. witwer whispers something, and anderson leans close to hear him.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{now do you believe?}
<A>__{anderson pulls away from witwer, and lets him take his last breaths alone.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<B>__{darkness}
<A>__{and then, slowly emerging from the mists of darkness, a pale, beautifully proportioned face. it is rose's face. the camera pulls back and we see that she is lying on a grassy hillside. her brother is lying beside her. they are looking up at the night sky, at a sky filled with stars. rose stares up into the sky, and speaks in a soft voice to her brother.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{james. can you guess what i'm thinking?}
<C>__{james}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{james smiles. and then, after a long moment, so does rose.}
<C>__{the end}
