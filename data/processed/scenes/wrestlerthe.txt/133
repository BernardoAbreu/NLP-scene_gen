<L>__{interior randy's trailer late night}
<A>__{randy, unable to sleep, sits shirtless on the couch, staring blankly at the tv.}
<T>__{on tv:}
<A>__{an nba highlight clip of a ferocious dunk. the crowd goes wild. the player roars as he runs back up court, full of macho swagger.}
<T>__{randy:}
<A>__{randy's eyes drift downward toward his chest. he gazes at the still fresh scar. touches it tenderly. he takes a big swig of wine, polishing off a bottle. he pops a cassette into the boombox on the floor. guns `n' roses }
<B>__{use your illusion ii.}
<A>__{randy cranks up the volume and hits play... music: guns `n' roses "get in the ring" the song begins with the sound of a roaring stadium crowd. a chant begins:}
<C>__{crowd }
<D>__{guns! and! roses!... guns! and! roses!...}
<A>__{randy starts to prowl the floor like it's a wrestling ring before a match. he waves his arms, exhorting the crowd on the song as if their cheers are for him.}
<C>__{randy}
<P>__{(cups hand to ear)}
<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{randy works the crowd. he points at a fan in the back row. flexes theatrically. bangs his head on pretend chairs. randy grabs the top rope and gives it a hard shake. loosening up with some neck rolls and trunk twists, he heads to the center of the ring.}
<C>__{randy }
<P>__{(announcer like)}
<D>__{folks, we are ready to rumble...}
<A>__{the song, which starts with a slow, bluesy guitar intro, kicks in. fast, raging hard rock. randy stares down his invisible opponent. the opponent sucker punches him. randy drops to the ground. randy lies on the floor getting kicked and punched. he knocks his opponent down with a leg sweep and pops up. randy hits his opponent with a flurry of backhand chops.}
<C>__{randy }
<D>__{i've never seen such determination!}
<A>__{randy immobilizes his opponent in some sort of headlock.}
<C>__{randy }
<D>__{sleeper claw!}
<A>__{randy flips his opponent upside down, his head between his knees. he drops him headfirst onto the bed mat.}
<C>__{randy }
<D>__{piledriver!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{just listen to this place!}
<A>__{randy scoops up his opponent again and slams him to the mat with another fancy move.}
<C>__{randy }
<D>__{powerbomb!}
<A>__{the song reaches its frenzied, chant like chorus:}
<D>__{guns `n' roses get in the ring! get in the ring! get in the ring! get in the ring!}
<A>__{randy joins in, pumping his fist.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{get in the ring! get in the ring! get in the ring! get in the ring!}
