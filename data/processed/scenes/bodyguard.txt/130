<L>__{interior service elevator day}
<A>__{frank's face shows the tension and the anger. the ele vator descends.}
<L>__{interior kitchen day}
<A>__{frank walks along the edge of the kitchen, looks over the workers. a kitchen worker is in frank's path. he looks up, sees frank's face and scurries out of his way.}
<L>__{interior basement service corridor day}
<A>__{frank walks along checking the corridor. at each door way, he stops, looks inside. one room is dark. he flicks on the light. near the door is a pile of wooden crates, placed unnaturally out from the wall. frank walks over and looks inside. they are discarded vegetable crates. frank goes back to the door and yells toward the kitchen.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{gomez! louis gomez!}
<A>__{he waits impatiently. no one comes. two quick steps and he is back at the crates, throwing them violently into the corner where they clatter loudly to the floor. frank walks on along the corridor. he stops, noticing something around the side. he investigates. an enormous cuban is sitting on some boxes in the shadows. he doesn't bat an eye when he sees frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{enormous cuban}
<D>__{is none of you fuckin' business.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{move it.}
<A>__{the enormous cuban gets slowly up from the boxes. he towers over frank.}
<C>__{enormous cuban}
<D>__{shove it up you ass, motherfucker.}
<A>__{frank has had enough for one afternoon. he hits the cuban low and hard. the man crumples forward, hurt, but manages to enfold frank in an awesome bear hug. his weight carries them backward in frank's direction. the cuban continues moving in that direction, but frank is no longer in his grasp. instead, incredibly, frank seems to have passed through the man's body and flicked him into the corner of the stairwell. the cuban hits the wall hard. jarred but not lost, he comes up and out wielding a long mop as if it were a baseball bat. frank steps in and under the man's long arms and hits him four times around the chest and jaw. each of frank's hands lands twice, their movement is barely visible. the solid thudding tells the story. frank strikes both the cuban's ears simultaneously with cupped hands. the cuban goes down, stunned. frank, his expression fierce, is upon him immediately. frank's arms entwine the cuban's and he begins to lift him roughly. at the end of the corridor, a woman screams.}
<C>__{cleaning woman }
<D>__{stop! please. don't hurt him. please stop!}
<A>__{frank looks up. a hotel cleaning woman, carrying her purse, is running towards them, tears already on her face.}
<C>__{cleaning woman}
<D>__{don't hurt my husband, mister. he not up to nothing.}
<A>__{frank lets the cuban down gently and stands up. dis gusted with himself. breathing hard, he leans back against the wall. the cleaning woman falls to her knees and hugs her husband protectively.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{frank steps away, rubs a hand through his hair, tries to collect himself. he's standing amidst dumpsters and discarded food boxes. he looks up and sees a marquee. rachel marron. tonite. benefit concert. 8 p.m.}
