<A>__{joe rips open the gift. it's a framed black and white of joe, sally and otis lying on the couch. it's clear which photos in the house are gina's. it's a breathtaking print, an amazing caught moment. all light and shadow. a touching study.}
<C>__{sally }
<P>__{(respectful of the talent)}
<D>__{it's beautiful, thank you so much.}
<A>__{joe, moved somehow, hugs gina to him. kisses her.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i love you, gina taylor.}
<A>__{sally's uncomfortable, a little jealous... feels intrusive. aware that gina got there first. knew him when. and always captures something naked and vulnerable in his face.}
