<L>__{interior diner day}
<A>__{bruce quickly walks to a back corner booth. the only other patron is an old man seated at the counter.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{it isn't real, it isn't real, it isn't real...}
<A>__{an older. sally kirkland type waitress, order pad in hand, stands listening to bruce with a raised eyebrow.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{oh hi, ah, coffee please.}
<A>__{the waitress pours him a cup.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{we've got a special on soup today.}

<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{it's tomato.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{alright, okay.}
<A>__{she heads off. bruce sits thinking. could it be real? he looks at the sugar down at the end of the table, holds out his hand and the sugar slides across the table right into his hand. the creamer slides into his other hand. bruce is half scared, half thrilled. he pours some cream and sugar into his cup, looks around the table.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{excuse me i need a spoooo...}
<A>__{bruce chokes up a spoon into his hands, wipes it off with his napkin.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{that's alright, i found one.}
<A>__{the old man eyes bruce suspiciously, gets up and moves further down the counter. the waitress sets down the soup, heads off, then turns back.}
<C>__{waitress}

<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{waitress}
<P>__{(sets the check down)}
<D>__{take care of that whenever you're ready.}
<A>__{bruce looks at the soup. his look grows intense. he slowly raises his hands over the soup bowl.... music up: the ten commandments theme the front door blows open, as a wind swirls through the diner and with all the flourish of moses at the red sea, bruce}
<B>__{parts his red soup.}
<A>__{a little cockroach scurries across the table, climbs up the edge of the bowl and walks through to the other side.}
<C>__{god }
<D>__{havin' fun?}
<A>__{bruce is startled and the soup splashes back to normal collapsing on the cockroach. he looks up at god standing beside the booth. bruce is now awestruck.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{you he thy...}
<C>__{god}
<D>__{let's take a walk.}
