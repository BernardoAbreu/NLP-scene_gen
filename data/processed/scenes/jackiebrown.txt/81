<D>__{you said it yourself. ray wants ordell, he don't give a shit about the money. money won't convict him, guns will. yeah, sure, if it falls in their lap, they take it. if they know they got it, they'll look for it... but if they don't...}
<B>__{back to max at mall}
<A>__{max watches the two cops turn their attention to the young girl eating in the food court. max watches her, too. the young girl continues to work her way through her mexican food, when she turns her head to an older black woman sitting at the next table. the older woman says something, and the younger woman hands her the ashtray jackie was using. max watches the young girl finish her food and get up from the table. she stoops down to get the broadway shopping bag and walks out of the food court. max watches nicolet and dargus let the young girl get a little ahead, then follow after her. they're gone. max turns back on the older woman all alone. she finishes the coffee she was drinking and stands up, carrying how about that? a broadway shopping bag. the woman heads out of the mall. max follows her. the older woman walks past us. she heads straight for the exit.}
