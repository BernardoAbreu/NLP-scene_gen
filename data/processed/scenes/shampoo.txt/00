<A>__{shampoo by robert towne and warren beatty dark screen november 4th, 1968 a darkness where even outlines are not discernible. there is a dim point of light coming from a dot on the hi fi which is playing the beach boys: "when we could say good night and still stay together... wouldn't it be niiiice?... we could be married, then we could be happy, wouldn't it be niiiiice?" through it there has been the sound of banging, distinct and rhythmic. it grows louder as the music ends. there are also whimpering sounds from a woman.}
<C>__{felicia's voice}
<D>__{oh, no.}
<C>__{george's voice}
<D>__{... what?...}
<C>__{felicia's voice}

<C>__{george's voice}
<D>__{nobody can hear it.}
<A>__{it bangs a couple of more times.}
<C>__{felicia's voice}
<D>__{i can. it makes me nervous.}
<A>__{it continues to bang until felicia screams, over the banging of the headboard. she follows the scream with a few yelps. silence. now the sound of the phone ringing.}
<C>__{felicia's voice }
<P>__{(complimentary)}

<D>__{what girl, she's not a girl, she's just a friend of mine.}
<A>__{felicia gives him a long hard look as he dresses.}
<C>__{felicia}
