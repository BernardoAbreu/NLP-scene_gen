<A>__{a moment of despondency, and then he hears a strange sound overhead and looks up... his pov as something suddenly flies across the star filled night sky above him... it is captain amazing, wearing a high tech rocket pack on his back...}

<D>__{where's he going?}
<P>__{(kicks his harley started)}
<A>__{series of shots with music as furious, following captain amazing, rides roughshod down the steep hill, skidding onto a road and then speeding through a residential area... he cuts onto some railroad tracks, hops his bike up on a rail, and rides smoothly along it, following amazing... he turns off the tracks, rides roughly through some woods, then emerges from the trees and sees.. a foreboding looking old mansion... captain amazing lands on the highest part of its roof... furious pulls up, gazes at the front gates of the mansion... his pov letters across the iron gates read... "frankenstein".}
