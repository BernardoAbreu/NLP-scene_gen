<D>__{miles hardin, mr. racine.}

<D>__{how are you?}

<D>__{i don't think you know mrs. kraft.}

<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{racine comes up to matty and takes her hand.}

<P>__{(to racine)}
<D>__{as i've told mrs. walker, i was more than a little surprised by the existence of this new will. edmund hadn't mentioned anything about it to me.}
<A>__{hardin looks at racine a beat, but racine has nothing to say.}
<C>__{hardin}
<D>__{mrs. walker explained to me that when she and her husband decided to make some minor changes, they just took care of it up here for simplicity's sake. and, indeed, as you know, the new will is almost identical to the old but for the disposition of a few items.}
<P>__{(to the group in general)}
<D>__{at the risk of oversimplifying, the thrust of the will is to divide the estate in almost equal parts between heather kraft and mrs. walker. would you agree with that assessment, mr. racine?}
<A>__{racine nods.}
<C>__{hardin}
<D>__{mmmm. and you witnessed the signing by edmund walker along with this miss }

<P>__{(to hardin)}
<D>__{pardon me. i'm sorry. i'm confused. is there some question about the authenticity of the will?}
<A>__{racine would like to kiss roz; instead he turns with a questioning look to hardin.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{i'm confused, too. do you have a problem with the witnessing or the signatures? what is it you're getting at?}
<C>__{hardin}
<P>__{(almost wistful)}
<D>__{no, there doesn't seem to be any problem here. this is edmund walker's last will and testament. i'm afraid the problem is elsewhere.}
<A>__{he reaches into his coat and brings out a gold cigar case.}
<C>__{hardin}
<D>__{would anyone mind if i smoked?}
<A>__{no one does. in fact, racine, matty and roz all immediately produce their own packs of cigarettes. the effect is comical and everyone in the room laughs at the group reflex. roz notices that lowenstein is not lighting up and offers him one of hers.}
