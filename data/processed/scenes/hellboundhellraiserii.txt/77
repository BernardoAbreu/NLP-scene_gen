<A>__{kirsty has found the black ring binder and laid it on the writing table. she has separated one of the photographs from the others and laid it out on the table beside the binder. it is the english officer from the opening sequence. kirsty has obviously recognized something familiar in it but she can't quite grasp it completely. she is still puzzling over it when she suddenly realises that several minutes have elapsed since kyle left her there. her head straightens up and her puzzled look is replaced by a slightly worried one.}

<D>__{kyle...?}
<A>__{she folds up the photograph and puts it in her pocket. she crosses to the door and opens it. she does not go through it immediately but stands in the doorway for a moment, her hand still on the door, cocking her head slightly as if listening.}

<P>__{(slightly louder)}
<D>__{kyle?}
<A>__{she can't hear anything, but she regards that as a bad sign, not a good one. she leaves the room.}
