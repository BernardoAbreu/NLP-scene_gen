<D>__{i've been branching out lately, reading native american stories about the character of the trickster. sometimes he shows up as a coyote, sometimes as a raven, but he always does the unexpected. the trickster breaks the rules. mark o'brien, whose life we're celebrating today, was very much the trickster anyone who knew him knew that.}
<C>__{father brendan }
<D>__{besides his irreverent humor and alarming honesty, he always did the unexpected. in nearly every aspect of his life, mark did the unexpected. his was a dynamic voice in a paralyzed body, a full life lived long after he should have been dead. he graduated from college, wrote and published articles and poems, and against all odds, by his own admission entered into the fully human experience of physical love. in this way, mark lived from day to day to day, from breath to breath to breath, for 49 years. he loved, and he was loved and in his quiet voice, he spoke loud truths.}
<A>__{we see rod, vera and laura the therapist in various rows. also amanda, holding a toddler in her arms and sitting next to a tall, boring looking husband.}

<C>__{susan}
<D>__{let me touch you with my words. for my hands lie limp as empty gloves. let my words stroke your hair, slide down your back and tickle your belly. for my hands, light and free flying as bricks, ignore my wishes and stubbornly refuse to carry out my quietest desires.}
<A>__{we see cheryl, as deeply touched by the words as she was the first time.}
<D>__{susan (v.o.) (cont'd) let my words enter your mind, bearing torches. admit them willingly into your being so they may caress you gently within.}
