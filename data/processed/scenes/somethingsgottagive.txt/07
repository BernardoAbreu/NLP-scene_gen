<L>__{interior living room}
<A>__{now wearing only his boxer shorts, harry crosses through the living room, singing 'livin' it up' to himself. he reaches into his bag and lifts out two bottles of crystal. he sees himself in the mirror, sucks in his gut.}
<L>__{interior kitchen}
<A>__{well stocked, the best of everything. harry opens the door to the fridge and just as he disappears behind it, the back door opens and two women enter from a beach walk, in the middle of a lively conversation. one of them is erica, marin's mother. the other is erica's younger sister, zoe. erica is in her mid fifties and is a poster girl for growing old. it's actually hard to imagine 55 looking any better. and not because she looks 35, but because she makes 55 look graceful and right. erica is the "girl most likely" who went beyond expectations but didn't realize until recently that being sure of herself was a handicap. she doesn't try to be intimidating, she just is. her sister, zoe is in her forties. zoe's the loose one. she wears draw string pants and a t shirt that says, "boys lie". the women stop mid sentence when they notice the refrigerator is wide open. then they see a pair of bare men's legs poking out from under the door. they don' t move.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{oh god. what is this?}
<A>__{erica nods to zoe, gesturing a nearby knife. zoe grabs the knife. harry pokes his head out from behind the fridge, equally confused.}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(in control)}
<D>__{okay, stay right where you are. we have a knife.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(eyeing the knife)}
<D>__{do you... live here?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{okay, mister, look, i'm gonna dial 911 and you're not gonna move. zoe, hand me the phone.}
<P>__{(reaches out to zoe without looking at her)}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you don't understand. i'm a friend of your daughter's.}
<A>__{with that, harry shuts the fridge door. the women see he's naked except for a pair of boxers. they both gasp. zoe fumbles the phone over to erica who dials quickly..}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{yeah? i don't think so. my daughter's in the city and you what, wandered in here,like high on ecstasy..?.}
<P>__{(looks at phone)}
<D>__{shit. i dialed 8 1 1.}
<P>__{(redials)}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(calmly starts to move)}
<D>__{honestly, if you just...}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{back off. she was in the israeli army. she can break you in half.}
<A>__{zoe can't believe she just said that no truth in it whatsoever.}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{yes. i have an intruder in my house. 29 daniels lane, sagaponack.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i'm dating your daughter marin. she invited me here for the weekend. she's in her room right now, changing.}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(gasps even louder, really scared now)}
<D>__{you're dating my daughter?}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{now who would've thought that would be worse news?}
<A>__{with that, marin enters, in a tiny bikini, sees harry in his shorts, zoe holding the knife and erica frozen, holding the phone.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{oh, fuck.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{oh, god.}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. false alarm. yeah, no, i'm sure. no, he's not a burglar}
<P>__{(with enormous difficulty)}
<D>__{he's dating my daughter.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{mom, i had no idea you were coming out this weekend, you said you had to write.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i do. i thought i'd do it out here.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{oh, man, this is really....}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{awkward.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{totally.. .but....}
<P>__{(starts laughing)}
<D>__{you gotta admit, sorta funny you thought he was a burglar? in his boxer shorts?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{yeah, well, the world's nuts, i don't know the man. . .}
<C>__{marin}
<P>__{(still laughing)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, it's not really funny. i'm an idiot. i should've told you i was bringing someone out.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{no, no, i should've told you we were coming. well. anyway, here we are.}
<P>__{(waves to harry)}
<D>__{hello. i'm the mother.}
<A>__{all three women turn to harry who now dangles a long lobster shaped oven mitt over his "privates"...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{harry langer. how are ya?}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{yes. sorry... mom, this is my friend, harry. harry, my mom, erica... my aunt, zoe.}
<P>__{(they all shake hands)}
<D>__{harry's sort of a new friend. i think i mentioned him in an e mail. we just, totally spur of the moment thought we'd get out of the city for a few days.}
<C>__{erica and zoe}
<D>__{of course...right...great...}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(can't look at him)}
<D>__{honey, does harry have a robe?}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(backing out)}
<D>__{you know what? actually, i think i should just take off. let you gals enjoy your weekend...}
<A>__{marin shoots her mom a look. help!}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{no, no, no. don't be silly. uh, look, here's what we'll do. zoe and i will leave. we took a great walk on the beach, we'll go into town for lunch. you two stay. harry, apologize about the near arrest.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{no, you were impressive. very strong, very... "macho".}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(a little thrown)}
<D>__{i don't think i was exactly "macho" ...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{trust me, if i ever catch a guy in his underwear in my refrigerator i hope i'm half the man you were, mrs uh...}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(already hating him)}
<D>__{yeah. okay. whatever...}
<A>__{marin watches. dying.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{all righty then...i'm definitely gonna hit the road.}
<P>__{(salutes erica and zoe)}
<D>__{ladies...sensational meeting you.}
<P>__{(then to marin)}
<D>__{doll, call me.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{hold on. hold on. let's not get so dramatic here. what are we four teenagers? we're all sophisticated people. why can't we all stay, for the weekend? your mother's got work to do i've got papers to grade. you'll do your thing, whatever that is and if we want to hang together, we'll hang together. if we don't, we don't. there's no reason why any of us should give up this spectacular weekend.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{seriously. i can handle it.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i can totally handle it.}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(on the spot)}
<D>__{i mean, well, i can "handle" it...}
<A>__{the women all look to harry. he looks at marin. she's hard to resist.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{it can only go up from here.}
