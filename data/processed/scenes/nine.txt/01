<A>__{departing, he closes the soundstage door. as the man crosses the shadowy stage, a dim shaft of light catches his face, weary, handsome, haggard. guido contini, the most famous film director in the world. in front of him: an enormous, dusty, multi level film set under construction. a complex maze of scaffolding, its unfinished, chaotic elements suggesting ancient ruins. cracked stone facades, broken columns, open platforming, the skeleton of a grand staircase. a lighting grid, not yet hung, and a camera crane surrounded by a forest of studio lights on stands. guido sits at the table, lights up a cigarette and puts on his glasses. he looks at the plans, looks up at the stage, puts his glasses down and stands up, stepping over to the crane. guido, alone, cigarette hanging from the corner of his mouth, contemplates the studio, its turbulent set, in every sense a jumble of ideas. guido looks at the set in despair. he sits in the bucket seat of the crane, buries his head in his hands, overwhelmed.}

<A>__{in the distance, a figure approaches out of the darkness, the darkness of guido's imagination. an escape from his tortured reality. the figure emerges gradually, like a goddess. she is gorgeous, imposing, and seductive. she is claudia, his film star, his muse. when claudia reaches guido, she stops in front of him, takes his hands from his face, and kisses him. and with that gesture, the music swells, the lighting grid rises majestically into the air, the gritty soundstage transforms into something beautiful, transforms into the interior world of guido's fantasy. as claudia moves away, more and more women slowly appear. they emerge from everywhere. these are the women from guido's life, past and present. women from his films, women he has loved, the sources of his inspiration and creative genius. a grand overture unfolds. the most significant women in guido's life are revealed, each with their own powerful entrance: luisa, his wife carla, his mistress lilli, his costume designer and accomplice guido's mamma, her spirit stephanie, a fashion journalist saraghina, a whore a dark and glamourous dream. the women surround guido and he loses himself and his anxiety in their collective embrace.}
