<L>__{interior morgue corridor day}
<A>__{the stretcher with the corpse on it is wheeled down a corridor in police headquarters. rosenberg's cat, still on his chest, meows curiously as the stretcher approaches two doors with "city morgue" written across them. the words split in half as the stretcher bangs through the doors.}
<L>__{interior morgue day}
<A>__{the city morgue is a crowded, brightly lit, tiled place with corpses parked left and right. busy day in the apple. the cop wheeling the stretcher calls out to the coroner, who's hunched over another body.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{where do you want contestant number three?}
<A>__{the coroner turns around. it's dr. laurel weaver, the woman who tried to speak to jay before. she sighs and waves a hand.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{by the wall, i guess.}
<P>__{(noticing)}
<D>__{what's with the cat?}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{oh, the cat. there's a problem with the cat. sign here.}
<A>__{laurel signs his clipboard.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{what's the problem with the cat?}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{your problem.}
<A>__{laurel gives him a dirty look, but he laughs and leaves. she goes over to the stretcher and bends down, petting rosenberg's cat gently.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{are you having a bad day, baby? cheer up.}
<P>__{(of rosenberg)}
<D>__{his is worse.}
<A>__{she sets the cat aside and wheels the stretcher under the lights.}
<C>__{laurel }
<D>__{okey dokey. shall we?}
