<L>__{interior reception hall}
<A>__{a scottish accordionist and a drummer play scotland the brave. some older scottish aunties are clapping and hooting loudly along with the tune. some young girl cousins in traditional scottish costume, dance the sword dance along to scotland}
<B>__{the brave.}
<A>__{we pass the buffet which we see is catered by "meats of the world." then we pass a very drunken stuart in a heated discussion with four other people.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{you know golden gate park was designed by a scotsman, macclaren, which is who macclaren park was named after.}
<A>__{the others agree heartily. may and tony are dancing. may is dancing uncomfortably close. she keeps sliding her hand down to his ass, which he then has to move back to his shoulder. then we come to william, who's reluctantly at the children's table. all his little cousins are queuing up for a chance to feel his head. we find charlie in a corner. one of the hooting scottish aunties is trying to get him to have another scotch.}
<C>__{auntie molly}
<P>__{(proffering the scotch)}
<D>__{charlie, get this down your neck.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{auntie molly if i have another one i will end up underneath the table with my kilt over my head.}
<A>__{tony joins them.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{where's harriet?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i don't know. oh, there she is.}
<A>__{she's in the corner by herself looking weird and ominous. she has enough food in front or her for three people. she eats ravenously and incessantly. charlie goes over to her.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{a little hungry, were you?}
<A>__{at that moment, a flash goes off. harriet looks up angrily.}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{what are you...!}
<A>__{then she realizes it's rose. she calms down and smiles. charlie looks at her, a little peculiarly, but harriet regains her composure.}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{sorry. the flash just...}
<A>__{the band kicks into a new dance. a young boy comes up to the bagpipe man with a shot of whiskey and whispers into his ear. the bagpipe man stops the song, downs the whiskey and then breaks into rod stewart's "if you think i'm sexy." from across the room we hear stuart singing.}
<C>__{stuart}
<P>__{(full volume; singing)}
<D>__{if you think i'm sexy... and you want my body... come on baby let me know.}
<A>__{stuart gives the bagpiper the thumbs up. the young people in the room start to jam, and then one by one the other guests start getting into the swing of things. the bagpipe man continues playing. it is clear that he is far too drunk to play. he slowly keels over, drunk. and as he falls over face first, he lands on his bagpipes. the bagpipes let out an atonal deflating sound like the last dying throes of a tortured animal. the bagpipe wail extends into the next scene.}
