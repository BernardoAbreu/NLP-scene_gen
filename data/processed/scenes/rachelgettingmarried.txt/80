<A>__{at the edge of the porch kym sees abby standing in the moonlight at the front of the driveway with andrew, waiting for their car. kym pauses. abby turns her head slightly in kym's direction. kym, in the half dark, watches her mother. abby does not move a muscle. kym steps off the porch. the valet pulls up in the car, jumps out. abby fixes her gaze on andrew as he opens the door for her. they drive off.}
