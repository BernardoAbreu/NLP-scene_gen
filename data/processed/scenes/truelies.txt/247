<L>__{exterior swamp night}
<A>__{harry takes her hand and they sprint for cover at the edge of the mangrove swamp. a light hits them. two terrorists, running around the corner, open fire with ak47s just as harry and helen reach a cluster of palm trees. the trunks explode with bullet hits as they run through the darkness. as the two terrorists move through the trees, harry lunges from the shadows and grabs one from behind. he wrests his rifle away and swings it at the other, knocking his ak down. the first terrorist draws a knife and slashes at him, but harry grabs his knife arm and swings the blade into his partner. then he elbow smashes the first guy and seizes him in a two hand neck breaker snap. two more run around the corner of a building. harry stomps his foot down on one of the aks, which is lying across a log. it flips into the air and he catches it in firing position . . . and takes them out with two well aimed bursts. helen comes out of the shadows staring at harry in amazement. his shirt is ripped, he is scratched and bleeding, holding an assault rifle expertly and scanning the brush like a feral animal.}
