<D>__{we appreciate your patience, bobby.}
<B>__{the face of spiro giavannis}
<A>__{as he looks into the camera. we can't yet tell where we are. he continues, backing up from us slowly, leading us somewhere not yet in focus:}
<C>__{spiro giavannis}
<D>__{the commissioner is here now, and he's ready to go.}
