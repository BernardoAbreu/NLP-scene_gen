<L>__{interior main room, joey's apt. night}
<A>__{this room too is empty. the music is louder and the soft warm pulse of the orange light is more distinct, bathing the walls and the furniture. various angles joey's pov as joey tries to locate the source of the music and the light; the sofa. the bookshelfs. the tv with the still and inactive box. the closed drapes over the big picture window. finally }
<B>__{angle on closet door}
<A>__{both the music and the light seem to be centered on the closet door across the room. they're both coming from behind it. joey approaches the closet, still tense, still careful. she opens the closet door and looks in. the closet is where joey has stored her past. but she's stored it neatly. boxed and piled on shelves are old magazines, old greetings cards, old photographs, old soft toys, college diplomas, clippings from small town newspapers ("death of a local hero: tommy summerskill lost in vietnam", "joanne summerskill class valedictorian: looks to career in media") etc etc. also in there, stuffed away at the top of the closet, is an old radio a big old wood and wire grille valve driven beauty from which the lilting music is coming. at some stage in its life, part of its casing was smashed away and the pulsing orange light is its flickering vacuum tubes. it's an old mains powered model and its mains cord dangles off the shelf of the closet. this radio isn't plugged into anything except the paranormal. close on joey; staring at this broadcast from the beyond.}

<D>__{how .... ?}
<A>__{joey reaches up and brings the radio down from the shelf and out into the main room. she sets it down on the coffee table in front of the sofa.}
<B>__{different angle}
<A>__{formal, classical framing from a low angle joey and radio in foreground, big picture window and its closed drapes in the background. joey kneels up in front of the table. she stares at the radio with the same kind of trapped fascination with which we have seen characters in the previous hellraiser movies stare at the box. her fingers are drawn to the tuning dial as if to a puzzle. she plays with the dial, moving through various "stations". joey's face is open with expectation as she moves through them, as if she is waiting for clues. or instructions. the music gives way to various voices; an indian voice giving some kind of commentary. the english words "bbc" and "world service" are heard amidst the punjabi. (joey turns the dial) a tired sad english voice;}

<A>__{(joey turns the dial) a resonant french voice;}
<C>__{french voice}
<D>__{l'oiseau chante avec ses doigts. deux fois.}
<A>__{(joey turns the dial) another burst of music, this time more raucous and syncopated. a ragtime tune from the birth of jazz. (joey turns the dial) dead air. an ominous pause. and elliott's voice.}
<C>__{elliott}
<D>__{joey. look out your window.}
<A>__{joey shrinks back in nervous shock at this direct address. the radio goes dead. the tubes stop glowing. the room is now a dimly lit place of shadow and suspense. joey glances back over her shoulder at her closed drapes and then at the silent radio. she stands up slowly and crosses to the drapes. the camera rises and tracks in as she walks, framing those drapes like curtains in a theater. with one strong gesture, joey sweeps the drapes open. and gasps. instead of neighboring roof tops and a view of the city, joey is looking directly into the interior of a quonset hut. it is the image from her tv set though full size, full color, and apparently real. at the far end, elliott sits cross legged on the floor. in front of him on the floor is the puzzle box. elsewhere in the hut; a camp bed on which lie a gun belt and an officer's peaked cap. and an old fashioned radio the same radio that is still in joey's room.}
<B>__{angle on joey}
<A>__{ as she stares beyond her window into this impossible scene.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{tell me ... tell me ... hello?}
<A>__{closer on the elements in the hut, as we (and joey) realize that everything in there is frozen in time. there is no movement, no sound. wonderingly (but carefully) joey stretches her arm out before her. when her arm reaches the threshold of the quonset hut, it disappears into the space once occupied by window glass. she pulls her arm back sharply with an intake of breath. maybe she even takes a half step backward.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{i'm seven floors up ... i'm seven floors up! i can't ...}
<A>__{but she can. she summons her courage, steps over the sill, and walks into the impossible.}
