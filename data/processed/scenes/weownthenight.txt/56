<L>__{interior cafe cappuccino brighton avenue night}
<A>__{across from the el caribe. it's like a scene out of balm in gilead here raucous clubgoers are eating burgers and drinking coffee after their nights on the town. bobby and rosario and louis sit at one of the tables. bobby kisses rosario on her forehead as she reaches into her purse. she looks through a small ziplock bag with a vial of cocaine. louis, meanwhile, is unaware of bobby's state of mind, and is busy putting on a show as usual:}
<C>__{louis falsetti}
<D>__{where'd you run off to, like a jew? you got outta there, it became like a real zoo. the spics }
<P>__{(looks to rosario)}
<D>__{`scuse me the p.r.s, they're goin' nuts for the money picka picka picka picka and the girls, they're screamin', and i'm keepin' everybody in line. i'm fuckin' bustin' heads, like bruce lee i'm fuckin' bustin' heads }
<A>__{he gets up and starts kicking and chopping in the air in the clumsiest manner possible. accidentally kicks the waitress, who's bringing the check.}
<C>__{louis falsetti }
<D>__{oh, `scuse me, sorry about that.}
<A>__{bobby picks up the check, hands louis some cash.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{hercules, do me a favor before you kill a waitress, go pay the check.}
<C>__{louis falsetti}
<D>__{arright. but i will tell you bobkes, nobody else could ever do for you what i did.}
<A>__{louis smiles, walks off. scoops up the tip from a nearby table.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{don't tell louis nothing about what happened. far as he knows, my family moved away, [a] long time ago.}
<C>__{rosario diaz}
<D>__{i ain't ever gonna say nothing! i just thought...maybe he could cheer you up a little.}
<A>__{bobby kisses her atop her head. just then: vadim and his gang enter the establishment. they create a ruckus. spotting bobby and rosario, vadim ambles toward them:}
<C>__{vadim nezhinski}
<D>__{hey, look who's here!}
<C>__{rosario diaz}
<D>__{hey vadim...}
<P>__{(as vadim approaches)}
<D>__{we were just gettin' something to eat.}
<C>__{vadim nezhinski}
<P>__{(nods; to bobby:)}
<D>__{you make it through that bust okay?}
<A>__{bobby gives a simple nod as well. inside, bobby is extremely uneasy, though outwardly he is quietly confident:}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{i didn't have nothing on me.}
<C>__{vadim nezhinski}
<D>__{glad to hear it.}
<A>__{without making eye contact, bobby shrugs; then:}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{your uncle's got some problems now, though.}
<C>__{vadim nezhinski}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{he does what he gotta do, i do what i gotta do. he don't own me.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<P>__{(to rosario)}
<D>__{baby why don't you go keep jumbo company, make sure he leaves a tip.}
<C>__{rosario diaz}
<D>__{`kay...}
<A>__{rosario leaves the table. two girls walk by:}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{hi, bobby!}
<A>__{bobby nods to them. vadim watches them walk away. then:}
<C>__{vadim nezhinski}
<D>__{you know }
<P>__{(moves closer; whispered:)}
<D>__{i still got my shit coming in. some of us think you could help get it out there.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{it's a little dangerous right now, don't you think?}
<C>__{vadim nezhinski}
<D>__{we got a lot of muscle behind us. lotta muscle.}
<A>__{the brazenness of the comment shocks bobby. he looks up, begins to focus. incredulous. softly, as the camera zooms}
