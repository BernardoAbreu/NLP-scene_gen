<A>__{cassandra is practically melting herself into sykes now. she takes his hand and guides his fingertips over her facial ridges. she shudders with pleasure. sykes begins to perspire.}

<D>__{there's lots of things i haven't done, but his ain't high on the list. don't take it personally.}
<C>__{cassandra}
<D>__{i think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out. a little scared... and a lot curious. maybe more than you want to admit. but doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?}
<P>__{(coos)}
<D>__{think of it as broadening your horizons.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{i like my horizons narrow.}

<D>__{your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.}
<A>__{he quickly disengages from her.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{my voice, body, and everything else is saying i will be back in two hours for strader, and he better damn well be here.}
