<L>__{interior guido's suite night}
<A>__{we seem to be looking at the set on stage 5. but suddenly a huge head dips into the shot and it's guido contemplating a model of the set. he places a figure on the top of the staircase. he moves round to the front of the model and places another figure on the top of the scaffold tower. he knocks it over. unconvinced, he sits down on the sofa. the coffee table is covered in head shots. he finds the one of claudia. guido looks at it. he lies back to write and finds himself in claudia's lap. she hands him a lipstick, smiles and strokes his hair. he starts to sign "to his excellency.... " then paints his lips and kisses the photo himself. claudia laughs.}
