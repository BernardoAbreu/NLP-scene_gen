<A>__{as lloyd's face drops, jack and frank step into the hallway and begin to walk slowly away, playing it cool, then glance at one another and begin to walk faster because they're about to burst out laughing.}
<B>__{following shot}
<A>__{by the time they reach the lobby, they are laughing, tripping across the carpet, out the front entrance and onto the sidewalk, where their voices explode in the night air and they begin to do a weird boyish waltz together, laughing giddily, until they see standing under an awning, lighting a cigarette susie, watching them with raised eyebrows. jack and frank, frozen in a clumsy embrace, quickly disengage and begin clearing their throats and squaring their cuffs. susie exhales a plume of smoke, studies them a moment, then smiles slightly.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{night, bakers.}
<A>__{as she turns away, jack glances up, watching her trim shadow disappear down the street.}
