<D>__{i'm sorry! i was caught up in the excitement of the moment. i should have checked. i made a mistake. i suppose that none of you have ever made a mistake before?}
<A>__{no one answers him. sami reaches inside the black canvas bag and removes the autographed baseball marcel took from zammito.}
<C>__{sami}
<D>__{this is great. after everything we've been through we've got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball.}
<C>__{marcel}
<D>__{the baseball is mine.}
<C>__{sami}

<D>__{raymond, don't you think they're over reacting a little?}
<C>__{raymond}

<P>__{(something in him snaps)}
<D>__{a fuckin' moron! how could you not check the money, you god damn stupid shit head!}

<D>__{give it to me, sami.}
<C>__{sami}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{marcel tries to take the ball out of the bag. sami pulls it away. marcel grabs the bag. both of them tug on it. marcel pulls hard and the bag rips down the seam. the baseball falls out and rolls off the bridge into the river.}
<C>__{sami}
<D>__{perfect.}
<A>__{marcel stands there holding the inside liner of the bag. sami throws the canvas bag to the ground in frustration. something catches daniel's attention. daniel's pov of the black canvas. the lining has been ripped away. a light breeze blows lifting the underside of the black canvas. there is a flash of color. another gust of wind turns the black canvas over. on the other side is van gogh's "vase with twelve sunflowers". daniel's jaw drops. the others notice his stunned expression and follow his stare. their pov of the priceless painting. they stand there, too shocked to move at first, then rush forward. they have almost reached the painting when a truck passes them. the wind kicks up the painting, blowing it over the railing. they reach out to grab it, but it is too far away. they stand there, watching as it slowly floats down to the river below.}
