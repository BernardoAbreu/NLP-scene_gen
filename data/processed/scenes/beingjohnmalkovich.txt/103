<D>__{tell me, craig, why do you love puppeteering?}
<P>__{(as craig)}
<D>__{well, maxine, i'm not sure exactly. perhaps it's the idea of becoming someone else for a little while. being inside another skin. moving differently, thinking differently, feeling differently.}
<P>__{(as maxine)}
<D>__{interesting. would you like to be inside my skin, craig? think what i think? feel what i feel?}
<P>__{(as craig)}
<D>__{more than anything. maxine.}
<P>__{(as maxine)}
<D>__{it's good in here, craig. better than your wildest dreams.}
