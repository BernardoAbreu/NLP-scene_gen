<D>__{can't you see anything except in terms of how it affects you?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{no! i can't! and neither can you, and neither can anybody else! only maybe i'm just a little more honest about it!}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{well, stop being so godamn honest, and start being a little generous! and start thinking about him for a while!}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i don't know what he expects from me. i never have known.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{well, i will tell you what he expects!}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{what? he wants me to throw my arms around him everytime he passes an exam? well, i can't do it! i cannot respond when someone says: "here, i just did this great thing. love me.". i can't!}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{all he wants... all he wants is to know you don't hate him. that's it.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{hate him? my god! how could i hate him? mothers don't hate their sons! is that what he told you? do you see how you accept what he says with no questions, and you can't do the same thing to me, can you?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i just try to keep this family together...}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(she shouts)}
<D>__{i don't know what everyone wants from me anymore!}
<C>__{audrey}

<C>__{ward}
<D>__{beth, listen. we all just want... cal, con, everybody, we just want you to be happy.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{happy?}
<C>__{ward}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{ward, you tell me the definition of happy, uh? but first, you better make sure that your kids are good and safe, that no one's fallen off a horse, or been hit by a car, or drowned in that swimming pool you're so proud of! and then you come to me and tell me how to be happy!}
<A>__{she leaves. calvin follows. ward and his wife just stand there.}
