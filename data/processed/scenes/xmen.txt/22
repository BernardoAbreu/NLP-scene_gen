<A>__{we hear an angry grunt as the thing starts to hunt for logan. it stalks across the ice, searching. we catch a glimpse of shoulder, a clawed foot, a mane of hair.}

<A>__{a violent yank. the ice gives way to the soaked and half frozen logan. the creature picks logan up by his face, cutting deeply into his cheek, and holds him up like a rag doll. the two are face to face. this is called sabretooth. the reasons are obvious. teeth like said animal and catis eyes to match. a mutant, certainly a member of a class remote in the extreme. and then it speaks.}

<D>__{itis not gonna be that easy.}
<A>__{logan, half drowned, opens his eyes and looks right at sabretooth as though heis going to say something. instead, a lung full of water comes shooting out. with that, sabretooth roars, as he hoists logan up and throws him. logan flies nearly ten yards. he lands head first. sabretooth skulks over to him. with the sound of sabretoothis breathing comes the rising of the wind... snow from the ground begins to swirl in the bitter cold air. sabretooth is nearly upon logan now and the wind rises further, until he must shield his eyes from the bitter icy air. as he approaches, we see a fresh cut on logan's face healing before our very eyes, leaving not so much as a scratch.}
