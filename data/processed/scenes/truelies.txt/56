<L>__{interior juno's offices day}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{ corporate art consulting company in san francisco. i have an appointment with ms. skinner }
<A>__{harry is extending his business card to the receptionist as juno breezes into the lobby from a corridor. she is dressed sharply and looks as stunning as harry remembers.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{harry! i thought i might see you again. i just didn't except you to call so soon.}
<A>__{juno lingers a second or so long on the handshake.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{well, what's the point of waiting?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i agree.}
<A>__{there is definitely unholy magnetism here. she indicates for harry to walk with her and leads him through the suite of offices. there are mounted fragments of ancient sculpture in niches on either side, and beautifully restored mosaics and tablets of hieroglyphics mounted on the walls.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{so your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{that's right. they want something... dramatic. i spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.}
<A>__{juno leads harry through a door into a large warehouse area. there is a bustle of activity as workmen unpack crates. an overhead crane is used to move huge stone pieces. there are massive columns, and statues two stories high. even the entire facade of a tomb.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{so what did these... people... say about me exactly?}
<A>__{they stroll amongst the statues, as coveralled workmen move around them with tools, scaffolding, pneumatic equipment. most of the workers are middle eastern.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{let's see... that you can read ancient sanskrit without having to sound out the words. and that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{those wimps. it's because i use my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.}
<P>__{(yelling in arabic to two workmen)}
<D>__{i told you to move those crates an hour ago. come on guys, let's get going.}
<A>__{we realize that a workman is watching them intently from nearby. he is an intense looking middle eastern man in his mid thirties.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{you see, a lot of these pieces are from ancient persia. unfortunately, ancient persia is twenty feet under the sand of iran, iraq and syria. not the most popular places lately. so i've had to become an expert in international diplomacy.}
<A>__{juno stops and looks at harry. her smile indicates the possibility of more than just business.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{well, do you see anything you like, mr. renquist?}
