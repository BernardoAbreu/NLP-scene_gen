<L>__{interior parlour, black cove farm. dusk}
<A>__{ada plays the piano. chopin's prelude in e minor. outside in the garden, monroe has adjourned to his striped campaign chair, and is hunched over his notes. the door of the parlour is open and the music floats over to him as he works. ada plays. a few spots of rain appear at the window. then the steady drumming of a summer shower.}

<D>__{daddy, bring the tablecloth in with you!}
<A>__{she plays some more. monroe hasn't come in. the rain splashes on to the window..}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{daddy, come inside before you drown!}
<A>__{after a few more bars, she stops playing and, curious, goes to the door. she stands at the doorway. monroe's sermon is caught in the wind and blows around him, the ink run to abstractions, his hand dropped and visible to ada as, with dread, she approaches. she catches the sodden papers, chasing after them, then reaches her dead father. he's like a fish, his face shining with the rain, and glass eyed. she leans in to him, her head to his heart, then runs, oblivious to the rain, her dress already drenched, runs down the lane.}
