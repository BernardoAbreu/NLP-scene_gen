<L>__{interior stu's private room night}
<A>__{the real julie awakens suddenly and lets out a scream of her own.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{stu!!!!}
<A>__{only now does she realize where she is. she's fallen asleep in the visitor's chair next to stu's bed. the clock on the wall reads 1:15 am. stu's readouts are spiking like crazy.}
<L>__{interior hyp's hideaway that moment night}
<A>__{stu is being dragged across the dance floor by the yeti and jumbo the elephant god. hand woman brings up the rear.}
<C>__{jumbo}
<D>__{who invited this schmuck, anyway?}
<C>__{hand woman}
<D>__{oh, it's my fault. i thought he was cooler than that.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{listen. please. it's my girlfriend. i've gotta get a message to her...}
<A>__{but just then a hush falls over the room, and someone screams...}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{hyp!!!}
<A>__{a wall panel does a 180 degree turn, and a circular bed rotates into the room. languishing atop it, garbed in a silk robe which exactly matches the black & white checkerboard pattern of the bedspread... ...is a chubby, grinning, sleepy eyed satyr, with horns and hooves. two wasp women are with him on the bed, brushing his furry goat legs and feeding him grapes. as stu fights his way over, he sees an odd lump wriggling under the bedcovers. out pops monkeybone, clutching a bottle of champagne!}
<C>__{monkeybone}
<D>__{i knew i left it in there somewhere.}
<A>__{he shakes the bottle, pops the cork, and sprays spurting bubbly at hypnos, the girls, and everyone else within firing range!}
<C>__{hypnos}
<D>__{haw! i like a monkey with vision!}
<C>__{monkeybone}
<D>__{you said it, partner!}
<A>__{hilarity all around. stu snatches monkeybone off the bed }
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{how'd you get in there?}
<C>__{monkeybone}
<D>__{stu... it's a party.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{mr. hypnos sir i needed to talk to you }
<C>__{hypnos}
<D>__{wait a minute. stu miley, right? boys and girls ...mr. stu miley, in the house!}
<P>__{(leading a round of applause)}
<D>__{this is an honor. we see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like caviar, man. you da shits!!}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{mr. hypnos, i saw a dream. my girlfriend was having it. she dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. she was watching me die.}
<C>__{hypnos}
<D>__{uh huh. and?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{well, i have to get a message to her. i have to let her know i'm okay. until i can get out of here...}
<A>__{a vaguely embarrassed look crosses hypnos's face. all the nearby darktowners stare at their shoes, clear their throats.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{...which is actually what i wanted to talk to you about. see, i've been here three months }
<A>__{with a brusque gesture, hypnos sends the party girls packing. he slings one arm around stu's shoulder and pulls him aside.}
<C>__{hypnos}
<D>__{kid didn't they tell you about this party?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{tell me what?}
<C>__{hypnos}
<D>__{it's a special kind of party. a farewell party. do you...get what i'm saying?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{farewell? you mean you mean i'm }
<A>__{stu explodes with joy. he practically dances a jig.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i'm going home! i'm waking up! hey, everybody! i'm outta here. i...}
<A>__{one by one, the celebrants turn their backs and slink discreetly away.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i think i...i'm about to... am i mistaken, or don't i get to... is there some...}
<C>__{hypnos}
<D>__{y'see, stu, as i understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support?}
<A>__{monkeybone's jaw drops. he slaps himself across the forehead.}
<C>__{monkeybone}
<D>__{pact? pact? no life support??}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{well yeah but that doesn't...apply. it was different then. i was depressed. my life is great now. i'm in love!}
<A>__{monkeybone marches back and forth across the bed, wearing a dimwit's expression as he mocks stu in a singsongy voice...}
<C>__{monkeybone}
<D>__{pull the plug! pull the plug! take my organs! i don't need 'em! i don't need no! life support! i'm an idiot! pull the pl }
<A>__{stu grabs the monkey and clamps a hand over his mouth.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{besides, julie wouldn't...she'd never...}
<C>__{hypnos}
<D>__{actually, stu, julie doesn't get to decide. that's why she was having the nightmare.}
<P>__{(an embarrassed shrug)}
<D>__{they're pulling the plug at nine am.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{nine am! but that's twelve hours.}
<A>__{in checking his watch, stu removes his hand from monkeybone's mouth. the singsong resumes...}
<C>__{monkeybone}
<D>__{i'm so dumb! i deserve to die }
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{mr. hypnos, you run this place. i'm begging you. there's gotta be something i can do.}
<C>__{hypnos}
<D>__{stu, i like you personally, i admire your work, but i'm just the god of sleep. this is death's bailiwick.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{maybe you could talk to death!}
<C>__{hypnos}
<D>__{me? me, go crawling to death? my friend, it will be a cold, cold day in las vegas, nevada, before i go crawling to that piece of }
<A>__{hyp shuts up. looks around the room, as if he's afraid of being overheard. then he gestures to the boys to join him on the bed. they climb aboard eagerly. hypnos hits his remote...}
