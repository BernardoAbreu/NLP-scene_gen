<L>__{exterior dirt road yei, sudan day}
<A>__{... sam, deng, and the others arriving at the source of the explosion. and we see green shorts laying on the side of the road... cut in half by a land mine... his dead eyes wide open with surprise... ... and sam drops to his knees... lifting what's left of the boy into his arms and rocking him back and forth... and we watch as a terrible sadness overtakes him... something happening here... a fierce and overwhelming burden dropping into this man as he holds this dead boy... in the dirt... in the middle of this savage world... ... and as sam puts it, his "life changed forever" in this moment... and we see him looking up to the heavens... tears streaming down his face... saying something we can't hear, but it's a promise... to god... to save the children of sudan.}
