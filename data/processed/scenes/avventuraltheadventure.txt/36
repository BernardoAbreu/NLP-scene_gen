<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{sandro comes out of his room and walks along through the corridors, heading towards the reception halls down at the other end. other persons are walking up and down the corridor in both directions. sandro's attention is attracted by the figure of a woman who is coming his way at a rather quick pace. she is wrapped in a tight fitting evening dress that emphasizes the various harmonious parts of her body. sandro looks at her. he seems to recognize her but isn't quite sure who it is. the girl passes alongside of him and apparently she too has the same impression, for she gives him a look that lasts much longer than it normally would between two complete strangers. she stops in front of a door but before entering, she casts another glance at sandro, who suddenly recalls that she is the same woman who had almost provoked a riot in the streets of messina and who was forced to take refuge in a men's shop. there is a moment of hesitation, then the girl opens the door and disappears into the room. sandro continues on ahead until he reaches the bar, which is still very crowded. evening clothes of all kinds. shiny silks. jewels dangling from wrists, necks and ears that are either white or bronzed by the sun. shoes of silver or lustrous black. headdresses of many women high, cropped or short and bobbed. men with hair well groomed but also frequently mussed. a vast, tumultuous wave of people, all wealthy and respectable, talking, laughing and carrying on as though the whole wide world was right there and everybody in it was like them. snatches of witticisms. faces of passing people. hands reaching out for glasses. the expressions on the face of the barman, smiling and indifferent. the sad, sullen face of the cloakroom attendant. the dumbfounded look on the face of a thirteen year old elevator boy. sandro feels very much at home in this milieu. one thinks so little, forgets so easily. and things are so conveniently ignored, beginning with one's own self. sandro moves through the crowd, here and there. standing next to the orchestra is a girl in black pants, singing strange songs in a soft, suggestive voice. sandro encounters ettore. as soon as he sees sandro, ettore comes over and places an arm around his shoulder, almost in the form of an embrace.}
<C>__{ettore}
<D>__{well, finally... come, i will introduce you to my friends.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{i want to take a look around first... i will join you later.}
<C>__{ettore}
<D>__{say, i hope it's understood that starting tomorrow morning, i will need to have you around. if you don't give me some figures to work with, how can i proceed?}
<A>__{sandro agrees with a nod of his head. but he is thoughtful and somewhat saddened. as ettore returns to his friends with whom he had been speaking and laughing, sandro looks at him almost with a sense of rage. then he goes back to the bar and orders something to drink. he is not aware that the girl from messina is just a few yards away and is watching him. she is extremely tanned, extremely voluptuous, and extremely beautiful. sandro moves away from the bar with the glass in his hand. he passes in front of a semi dark room and takes a peek inside: a television set is turned on but nobody is watching it. sandro is restless. he comes to a terrace and stops to look down at the illuminated docks below. the headlights of cars passing by fan out across the road that runs along the shore of the sea. with an angry gesture, sandro finishes his drink, gulping the whiskey down in one fast swallow. he squeezes the empty glass in his hand as though he had wanted to crush it.}
