<L>__{ext hammond's quarters afternoon}
<A>__{wu stands at the open sliding gate of the perimeter fence surrounding hammond's quarters.. next to him is ellie. behind both of them, launcher at the ready, is muldoon. watching from the window above, hammond waves. ellie and wu wear radio headsets.}
<C>__{muldoon}
<D>__{okay wu, i will have you covered at every moment. but this shell carries quite a punch, so if you're too close, it'll take a piece of you. ellie's on the headset with you. if another ones come at you, let her know. then ellie you start jumping and yelling. the buggers are easily distracted. they'll come running and let wu get that power on. then both of you, get behind this fence as quick as possible.}
<A>__{wu and ellie nod seriously and test radio contact. we starts his way across the lawn, muldoon limps behind with his launcher. ellie stands ready at the open gate. wu takes slow steps. muldoon follows. wu is just five feet away from the door to the generator building. close on wu's tense face. the attack is sudden and fierce. it comes from the brush. the raptor leaps onto wu in an instant. wu and the raptor roll on the ground. wu struggles for his life. muldoon can't get a safe shot. he scream:}
<C>__{muldoon}
<D>__{wu, get away. give me room to shoot.}
<A>__{ellie comes running away from the safety of the gate. she jumps up and down, waving her hands, and screams:}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{hey you cretaceous dromaeosaur, you can't catch me. hey, come and get me, you flat snouted mongolian beast. hey!}
<A>__{the raptor is distracted by this. he lets wu go for a moment, shaking him loose from his bloody jaws. instantly, wu rolls away. muldoon fires the rocket launcher. with a sizzle, the missile fires. boom! direct hit! the raptor is blown to tiny pieces. muldoon grabs wu and pulls the inju red man to safety.}
<C>__{muldoon}
<D>__{you ok?}
<A>__{in reply wu gets to his feet, looks where the raptor was.}
<C>__{wu}
<D>__{now, there's four.}
<A>__{muldoon helps wu back inside the fence. he waves for ellie to come in and join them. ellie takes off toward the generator building. she yells:}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{i'm going in. muldoon, cover the door after i go in. wu, guide me!}
<A>__{muldoon yells for her to wait but stops when he realizes that this may be their best plan. ellie races like a gazelle across the open lawn. she's very fast and graceful. she ducks into the generator building. above it all, hammond watches at the small viewing window. back on grant and kids at fence the three are at the top of the fence now. grant carefully lifts lex above the barbed wire and she grabs onto the other side of the fence to begin the climb down. grant grabs tim and lifts him nexterior tim's tense face is a river of sweat.}
