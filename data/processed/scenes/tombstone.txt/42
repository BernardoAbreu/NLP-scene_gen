<L>__{int oriental night}
<A>__{dark circles under his eyes, looking dreadful, doc is at the corner table with virgil, behan, ike clanton, and the mclaurys. josephine lounges by the piano, luscious in a white gown, singing "frankie and johnny" in a torchy voice. wyatt enters, blanching at the sight of josephine. joyce appears at his elbow:}

<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{nice voice.}
<C>__{behan}
<D>__{that's not what i meant.}
<A>__{behan gives him a wink. wyatt shifts uneasily in his seat. this hand is down to doc and ike and the pot is huge. doc shows his hand. ike throws his cards down in a drunken rage:}
<C>__{ike}
<D>__{son of a bitch! that's twelve straight hands! nobody's that lucky.}
<A>__{the earps stiffen as the cheshire cat smile comes over doc:}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{why, ike, whatever do you mean?}
<C>__{virgil}
<D>__{come on, boys, take it easy.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{maybe poker's not your game, ike. i know, let's have a spelling contest!}
<C>__{ike}
<P>__{(stands)}
<D>__{i will wring your scrawny neck for you!}
<C>__{virgil}
<P>__{(grabs him)}
<D>__{that's enough, clanton.}
<C>__{ike}
<D>__{you takin' his part? i'm the one was cheated. god damn pimps, you're all in it together.}
<C>__{virgil}
<D>__{nobody's in anything, clanton, you're drunk. go home and sleep it off.}
<C>__{ike}
<D>__{get your god damn hands off me! don't you ever put your hands on one of us! don't you ever try to man handle a cowboy! we'll out your god damn pimp's heart out! understand, pimp?}
<C>__{virgil}
<D>__{don't you threaten me, you little }
<A>__{violence seems imminent. wyatt jumps in, separating them. behan notices as josephine gasps, a look of alarm crossing her face.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{virgil, don't! take it easy! ike, just go home and forget it, will you?}
<C>__{ike}
<D>__{i ain't forgettin' nothin.}
<A>__{ike lurches to the bar. behan takes josephine aside, whispering:}
<C>__{behan}
<D>__{i saw that look on your face just now. what's between you and wyatt?}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{absolutely nothing.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{well that certainly was a bust. i want my money back. come, darling, let's seek our entertainment elsewhere.}
<A>__{doc stands up, taking kate's arm to leave. but he falls back down dizzily, suddenly breaking out in a sweat and coughing.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{what's wrong, doc?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{nothing. not a thing. i'm right as the mail.}
<A>__{again he tries to stand. this time he keels over onto the floor and starts coughing up blood. wyatt rushes to him.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{get a doctor! virgil, give me a hand.}
<A>__{they lift the unconscious doc off the floor. ike turns to joyce.}
<C>__{ike}
<D>__{what's wrong with him?}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{lunger.}
