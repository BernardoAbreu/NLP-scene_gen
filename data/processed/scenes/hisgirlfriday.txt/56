<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{what do you mean through?}
<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{i mean i'm scratching your name off the ticket tuesday and running czernecki in your place. it's nothing personal. and, pete it's the only way out. it's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make.}

<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{now, pete! please don't appeal to my sentimental side.}
<C>__{hartman}
<D>__{fred, i don't know what to say. a thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.}

<D>__{i wish you wouldn't talk like that, pete.}
<C>__{hartman}
<D>__{our families, fred. i've always looked on bessie as my own sister.}

<C>__{hartman}
<D>__{well, there's a lot of communistic sympathizers around }
<C>__{mayor}

<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{fishing! duckshooting! how do you like that. a guy does nothing more strenuous for forty years than play pinochle he gets elected governor and right away he thinks he's tarzan!}
<C>__{hartman}
<P>__{(thrusting the document at the mayor)}
<D>__{read it! insane, he says.}
<P>__{(shaking a finger in pinkus' face)}

<D>__{who? me?}
<C>__{mayor}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{who do you think!}
<A>__{pinkus is a little startled; the mayor hastens to adopt a milder manner.}

<C>__{pinkus}
<D>__{i couldn't work in the city. you see, i've got my family in the country.}
<C>__{mayor}

<D>__{but you could bring 'em in here! we'll pay all your expenses.}
<C>__{pinkus}
<P>__{(with vast thought)}
<D>__{no, i don't think so.}
<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{for heaven's sake, why not?}
<C>__{pinkus}
<D>__{i got two kids going to school there, and if i changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.}
<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{no, they wouldn't they'd gain one! and i guarantee that they'll graduate with highest honors!}

<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{hold your horses will you, olsen? hurry up, fred!}
<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{now what do you say?}
<C>__{pinkus}
<D>__{this puts me in a peculiar hole.}
<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{no, it doesn't.}
<P>__{(hands him the reprieve)}
<D>__{now, remember: you never delivered this.}
<P>__{(rushing him to the door)}

<D>__{go to this address. it's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care of you for the night. just tell 'em fred sent you. and here's fifty dollars on account.}
<A>__{he pushes money into pinkus's hand and pushes him through the door. pinkus goes.}
<C>__{hartman}
<P>__{(into phone, desperately)}
<D>__{will you wait, olsen? i will tell you in a minute!}
<A>__{the door opens again and pinkus comes back in.}
<C>__{pinkus}
<D>__{you forgot to tell me what a city sealer has to do.}
<C>__{mayor}
<P>__{(turning hastily toward pinkus)}
<D>__{i will explain it tomorrow!}
<C>__{pinkus}
<D>__{is it hard?}
<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{no! it's easy it's very easy!}
<C>__{hartman}
<P>__{(pleadingly, into phone)}
<D>__{just one second }
<C>__{pinkus}
<D>__{that's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.}
<C>__{mayor}
<P>__{(pushing him out the door)}
<D>__{we'll fix that, too.}
<P>__{(he closes the door after him)}
<C>__{hartman}
<P>__{(into phone one more plea)}
<D>__{just one second!}
<A>__{he turns to the mayor with a gesture of appeal. the mayor closes the door and turns to hartman.}
<C>__{mayor}
<P>__{(huskily)}
<D>__{all right. tell 'em to shoot to kill.}
<C>__{hartman}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{shoot to kill, i said.}
<C>__{hartman}
<D>__{i don't know, fred. there's that reprieve if they ever find out.}
<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. now, do as i tell you.}
<C>__{hartman}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{hello, olsen... listen...}

<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{now take that guilty look off your face, pete and stop trembling like a horse.}
<C>__{hartman}
