<D>__{mr. basquiat what a pleasure to see you again.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{hey george, what's up?}
<A>__{a huge table with nine white executives. waiters clear their lunch settings. as they spot jean and gina entering, they gawk and snicker. george leads them to their table. as they take their seats, jean notices the suppressed giggles coming from the executives' table. they try to ignore it. george disappears. jean seems self conscious about the sores on his face.}
