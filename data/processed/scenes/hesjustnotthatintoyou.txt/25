<L>__{interior gigi's apartment bedroom night}
<A>__{gigi lays in bed, her cell phone right next to her head. one eye pops open, checks the phone, and closes again.}
<L>__{interior mccormick spices corporate headquarters day}
<A>__{a typical, corporate style office. walled off cubicles for the junior execs, outer offices for management. gigi is in her cubicle. janine, her friend and, we now learn, co worker, sits on gigi's desk.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{so, this was at the end of the date, or at the beginning?}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{end. why does it matter?}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{yeah. "nice meeting you" at the beginning of the date is normal. "nice meeting you" at the end could be a blow off.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{maybe it was at the beginning.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{then that's fine. he's gonna call.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{or maybe it was at the end. or maybe it was nice to meet me.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{wait was it "nice meeting you" or "nice to meet you"?}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{shit. i can't remember.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{"nice to meet you" is ok. "nice meeting you" is like "do you want your receipt in the bag?"}
<A>__{the girls look up to find beth standing there, listening.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{remember the days when you guys at least pretended to be working when i came in?}
<A>__{beth heads to her office. janine and gigi follow.}
<C>__{beth }
<D>__{janine, how's the press release?}
<A>__{janine, clearly organized, flips open her notebook:}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{beckon the baking to begin! mccormick, the flavor expert, introduces five fun filled flavors that will definitely delight dessert divas!}
<A>__{gigi stifles a laugh.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{maybe a shade heavy on the alliteration but otherwise good.}
<P>__{(to gigi)}
<D>__{where are we with the company newsletter?}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{i am so almost done with that. it's just been a little hard to focus on my article about the two sets of twins in market research, when the guy who may or may not be the guy of my dreams refuses to call me.}
<A>__{beth looks at gigi, more sympathetic friend than boss.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{look, after my first date with neil, i called him. there are no rules anymore. why should you have to wait for him to get off his ass?}
