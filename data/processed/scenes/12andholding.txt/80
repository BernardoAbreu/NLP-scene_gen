<L>__{exterior junior high school auditorium days later night}
<A>__{parents and students file inside. a large sign above the door reads, jefferson junior high fall recital.}
<L>__{interior school auditorium continuous}
<A>__{a packed audience listens to a girl (12), standing center stage and singing "the rose". she is not nearly as good as she thinks she is, but she sings full throttle. we find malee, sitting in the flute section and playing along with the rest of the orchestra. she looks to the front row, but gus is no where to be found. the girl finishes her song, and the crowd politely applauds. mr. farmer crosses to the microphone.}
<C>__{mr. farmer}
<D>__{i'm sure bette midler would be most impressed with that rendition.}
<A>__{the crowd laughs. mr. farmer didn't mean for it to be a joke.}
<C>__{mr. farmer }
<D>__{anyway, our next soloist is malee chung. she will play the theme from "love story" on the flute.}
<A>__{the crowd applauds as malee rises and crosses to the microphone.}
<C>__{malee}
<D>__{thank you, mr. farmer.}
<A>__{malee spots gus, walking down the aisle. he scurries into the front row and sits. malee lights up.}
<C>__{malee }
<D>__{there's actually been a change. i'm not going to play the theme from "love story". um... this is a song...}
<A>__{mr. farmer, waves to malee from off stage. malee looks at him. mr. farmer mouths something to her.}
<D>__{malee (into microphone) (cont'd)}
<P>__{(to mr. farmer)}
<D>__{what? i can't hear you?}
<A>__{mr. farmer throws up his hands.}
<C>__{malee }
<D>__{anyway. this is a song by the doors.}
<A>__{at the mention of the doors, gus' smile instantly fades. the coincidence is just too great. malee starts to play "light my fire". she is good. mr. farmer and the audience seem pleased by her euphonious performance. even gus is won over. he appears entranced by the music.}
