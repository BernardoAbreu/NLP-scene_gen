<A>__{the side door opens with almost no sound. the hooded figure of david dunne steps into a narrow laundry room. the sound of a television is heard from another room. a very large pile of unopened mail sits in a mound on the clothes dryer. two or three days worth. david shuts the door very slowly.}

<B>__{the sounds of cheering from the television in the next room spill into the kitchen.}
<A>__{david stares out from under his hood at the mess. cabinets are left open. empty cans of food sit on the counter with a handful of unwashed dishes. the breakfast table is the eeriest thing in the room. it sits frozen with a plate of half eaten, now moldy eggs at one setting and two bowls of colorful cereal in another. the cereal has dissolved in the old milk. two cockroaches are crawling in the bowl. david moves slowly to a door in the kitchen. it's slightly open. as david gets closer, he shields his face from the strong smell. he pulls the door open quietly. a shaft of kitchen lights falls down the stairs into the basement. at the bottom of the stairs is a man's body. the same man who answered the door in the flashback lays partly in the shadow, partly in the light. his crumpled tie lies folded over itself on his still chest.}
