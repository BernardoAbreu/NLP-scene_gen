<A>__{chaotic shots: more nests explode into individual creatures, winged hatchlings moving like bats in a fire, talons hacking and slashing. his exit blocked, pilgrim #3 veers into... a dark supply room. he slams the door, mumbles a blessing and waits for the storm to pass. he's been cut but at least he's still alive.}

<A>__{hinges are blasted away. the door caves in. imam shoulders past johns to enter and find... the empty coring room.}
<C>__{imam}
<D>__{ali?}
<A>__{a noise from the supply room. is it ali? just too scared to come out? imam opens the door... and hatchlings pour out . moving with a gang intelligence, they circle the room in a wave, soar high into the rafters then plunge into the coring shaft, squeals vanishing to infinity. shocked silence, then... pilgrim #3 tumbles to the ground. he's been shredded into bloody kite tails. there was a nest inside the supply room. imam falls on him in grief. johns and fry inch forward to peer down... the coring shaft. it's littered with human bones. the skeletons of the settlers. scattered about and picked clean.}
