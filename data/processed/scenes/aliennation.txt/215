<L>__{exterior water and helicopter night}
<A>__{the helicopter moves down toward the turbulent water. jetson hangs in the doorway, watching sykes' head dunking under again. the helicopter's skids are three feet above the water.}

<P>__{(to pilot)}
<D>__{all the way!}

<D>__{i can't it'll ditch!}
<A>__{sykes' outreached hand stretches up from the water, but the skid is just too high. jetson has no alternative, and he does the bravest thing he has ever done. he moves out onto the narrow helicopter skid. hanging on, three feet above the water, he reaches down for sykes' up reaching hand. the fingertips of the two hands waver mere inches from each other... jetson stretches farther, farther... and the two hands meet! jetson winces from the pain of the seawater on sykes' hand. he starts pulling sykes up. when harcourt's head breaks the surface a foot from sykes' face. his eye sockets are empty and his skin is mostly gone. the nearly skeletal body heaves blindly onto sykes, breaking his grip from jetson's, and dragging him under again. jetson is frantic. he keeps waiting but this time sykes doesn't come up. jetson doesn't know what to do. finally he leans down as far as he can, his face a foot from the water, screams to block the pain, and plunges his own arm below the surface! he feels around, gets hold of something, and pulls. it is sykes' wrist. he pulls hard, bringing the sputtering sykes up out of the water.}
<C>__{jetson}
<P>__{(to pilot)}
<D>__{take it up!}
<A>__{the pilot does. sykes comes up out of the water. his feet are just clear of the surface when harcourt's hand and arm rocket out of the water, grabbing sykes' ankle. sykes looks down in horror. the helicopter keeps moving up, and before harcourt's body breaks the surface, the arm tears away from the torso at the shoulder. sykes wildly shakes the clinging severed arm from his ankle, and it falls back into the water below. jetson continues pulling him up into the helicopter as it moves off toward shore.}
