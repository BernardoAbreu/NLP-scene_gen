<L>__{interior the blood boudoir day}
<A>__{kirsty moves three or four steps into the room and then stops dead. the door swings shut behind her. kirsty's eyes flick left and right, taking in the sickening details of the room's contents, and then stare straight ahead, focusing on the figure in white which is turning around to face her. julia completes her turn and looks at kirsty completely impassively for a moment. then her mouth opens up into a smile of welcome but there is nothing but hate in her eyes.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{kirsty! how nice of you to drop in.}
<A>__{julia glances meaningfully at the dead thing that lies beside her feet and then back at kirsty.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{you have surprisingly good taste in men.}
<A>__{kirsty's fear and disgust are momentarily displaced by a furious rage as she realises what julia has done. her face erupts into anger and she screams out.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{kyle! no! i will kill you, you...}
<A>__{she flings herself across the room at julia even as she speaks. julia is completely unphased by this attack and simply raises one arm. she siezes the wrist of the arm that kirsty has raised into a clenched fist and effortlessly throws kirsty bodily back across the room. we realise for the first time the immense physical strength that julia now possesses. kirsty smashes into the door and falls to a sitting position against it. she is shaken and slightly hurt enough not to get to her feet immediately but she stares at julia with undimmed hatred. julia throws a look halfway between a smile and a sneer.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{oh, you can try it, you little bitch. i'd love you to try it. but i'm not just the woman i was.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{what, you mean you're something more than a whore with a vicious streak?}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{i mean i'm something more than human, you little shit!}
<A>__{julia snaps this first line but then holds her anger in check. she shakes her head and an amused smile plays across her lips.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{oh, kirsty. they didn't tell you, did they? i'm afraid they've changed the rules of the fairy tale; i'm no longer just the wicked step mother.}
<A>__{the smile disappears and she delivers the next line with an utterly straight face. it is, after all, the truth.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{now i'm the evil queen.}
<A>__{the hatred and the heat returns to her voice.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{so come on; take your best shot, snow white.}
<A>__{kirsty scrambles to her feet and again charges at julia. julia steps forward to meet her advance and delivers a single back handed swipe across kirsty's face with such force that not only is the girl knocked off her feet but is actually knocked unconscious. kirsty rolls onto her back and lies at julia's feet. julia stares down at the unconscious body. when it was awake, it was kirsty and her attitude to it was based on personal enmity. now, it is simply another body and she judges it differently; it is firm, full, healthy, and young. we see the expression on her face change from hatred and triumph to pure appetite. she licks her lips and her eyes glisten. she begins to bend slightly towards it.}
<C>__{malahide}
<P>__{(off camera)}
<D>__{julia!}
<A>__{the door to the room opens. julia straightens up and looks as malahide stands in the doorway. her eyebrows question this interruption. a second later, and it is explained. he leads tiffany into the room.}
