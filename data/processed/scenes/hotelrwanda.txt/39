<L>__{interior paul's living room. night}
<A>__{thomas and fedens wait, anxious, as paul appears.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you better stay the night, it is too dangerous to be on the streets.}
<A>__{tatiana hides her anger.}
<C>__{tatiana}
<D>__{i will fix a bed.}
<L>__{interior paul's bedroom. night}
<A>__{paul lies in bed unable to sleep. the clock reads 3:00 am.}
<C>__{tatiana}
<D>__{why didn't you call your contacts in the army?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i couldn't help.}
<C>__{tatiana}
<D>__{you could have asked for a favor.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no, i could not. what do you know about favors tatiana, about barter and deals? all day long i work to please this officer, that diplomat, this tourist. to store up favors so that if there is a time when my family need help i have powerful people i can call upon. now you would have me waste a precious favor on a stranger.}
<C>__{tatiana}
<D>__{victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{he was not family. family is all that matters. do you think if you or i were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?}
<C>__{tatiana}
<D>__{they do not have your connections.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{connections? i have no connections, only favors. if i call to help victor, a general will think "paul rusesabagina is a fool. he thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." then my hard work is doubly squandered. i insult the general and i do not get to use my favor at all. please leave these things to my good judgment.}
<A>__{his turn away indicates the discussion is over.}
