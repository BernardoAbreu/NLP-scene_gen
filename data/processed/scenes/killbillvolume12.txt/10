<A>__{the front door opens and an attractive black housewife the same age as the bride stands in the doorway. the housewife's face shows immediate recognition of the blonde on her doorstep. the bride on the porch; we do a quick shaw brothers style zoom into her eyes. flashback spaghetti western style (that means our heroine is remembering something, and we see it with an orange filter.) we're back inside the wedding chapel. the bride is taking the beating of her life by four people in black suits. a black woman punches her in the face... we see it's the black housewife, five years earlier. the bride on the porch we zoom quick out of her eyes to cu, a vengeance theme plays loud on the soundtrack. (whenever we hear this theme throughout the picture, we'll quickly learn what accompanies it is the bride goin krakatoa all over whoever's ass happens to be in front of her at that moment.) as the vengeance theme plays, a vein in the bride's forehead begins to pulsate. when the vengeance theme stops, the bride attacks the housewife.}
