<D>__{spending the night at your house. this very bad. very bad.}
<C>__{aokee }
<D>__{he should be done with the dishes by now. tell him we want to talk.}
<A>__{alex disappears back into the kitchen. aokee goes to an empty table under the one light on in the dining area and sits down. alex comes back and robbie follows.}
<C>__{robbie}

<D>__{robbie. she's still going out with cowboy. i saw them together at the movies two nights ago.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{maybe she's just letting him down easy.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{robbie...things...things are not always what they seem to be.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{aokee}
<D>__{in this case, she acts like she likes you when really she wants cowboy to win.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{naw. you guys are nuts. she's not like that.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{she is like that.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{look, i know what to believe and what not to. i'm not that easily fooled.}

<A>__{aokee's head is down in his hands. robbie looks stunned.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{manuel's family snuck across the border ten years ago through juarez, mexico.}
<C>__{aokee}

<C>__{aokee}
<P>__{(accent now mexican)}
<D>__{a name i picked up reading an obituary in the paper. i sent away to hawaii and got his birth records and social security number. this way, i never have to worry about immigration. i spent weeks watching tapes of hawaii five o just to get the accent right.
