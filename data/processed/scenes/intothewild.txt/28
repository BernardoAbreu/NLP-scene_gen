<L>__{interior datsun night}
<A>__{chris mccandless, in the same clothes he had been in back in the rooming house, sleeps in the back seat of the datsun. his head supported by his backpack. we begin to hear a rumble. but this rumble is not thunder. it rapidly builds into an alarming roar. the roar grows to a deafening level. chris awakens. as he peeks up from the backseat looking forward through the windshield, he just barely catches sight of the leading edge of a flash flood. a four foot high wall of water, mud and debris makes impact with the datsun, momentarily enveloping it in water. suddenly the car is slammed against the cliff. crack! chris sits upright, disoriented. pov: as far as the eye can see in the desert moonlight, water has taken over the desert with a flash flood. however, there's no panic in chris' face as we observe him past a new crack in the wet windshield. the water, while violent seems to have topped off just above the wheels. chris gets a slight smile on his face, as the car settles into its new position below the cliff. he returns to sleep.}
