<A>__{jeremy moves off, wide eyed and disturbed.}
<C>__{male sydney}
<D>__{that's why i became a woman in the first place. i couldn't handle it. figured if i was female, it was okay to like guys.}

<D>__{she's lyin'.}
<A>__{male sydney shakes his head 'no.'}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{you're tellin' me, 'cause you're straight as a girl and i'm straight as a guy, we can screw and switch, but...}

<C>__{luca}
<D>__{what about him?}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{don't you care about him at all?!}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{not like that: i'm straight! i'm attracted to you!}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{oh, who cares, you idiot! and sorry to break it to you, but i'm straight too.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{no. this'll sound crazy, but i'm not who you think i am }
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{oh, christ, luke, luca: i know who you are!}
<A>__{luca stares, stunned.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{you know i'm a zerophiliac?!}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{yes! so you can just go fuck yourself. literally!}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{does max know who i am?}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{what if he does? do you?}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{he's a guy!}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{and you're a girl!}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{i'm not!}
<A>__{michelle gestures "oh really?!"}
<C>__{luca }
<D>__{i'm not supposed to be!}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{there's no supposed to be anything, you just are!}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{is that what you think?! no!}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{well, then congratulations! you're a guy, just like every other guy i ever met! i can't believe you slept with him!}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{he was a woman! i was tricked. i didn't know i'd switch.}
<A>__{michelle stares, incredulous.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{you're gonna' tell me he's a z too?! both of you?!}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{yes!}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{well, that's just perfect. what, is there something in the water around here?!}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{she told me it would make it stop. that it would keep me from turning into a girl.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{so what?! why's that so important to you?! there's no way this was gonna' work.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{because i'm a zerophiliac.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{because you can't stand being one! bye, luca.}
<C>__{luca}
<P>__{(correcting her)}
<D>__{luke.}
<A>__{she glances back, sad and angry. luca watches her go, distraught, and then runs...}
<B>__{atop a grassy hillside}
<A>__{luca collapses on the ground, overlooking polly wog's. janine and keenan run up, a few yards behind. they sit nearby, catching their breath, unsure what to say. luca gazes up at the moon.}
<C>__{luca }
<D>__{what's it like? to really make love?}
<A>__{they all three gaze up at the moon. keenan steals a glance at janine.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{the best part's just lyin' there after. really close, really far away.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{like goin' to the moon, maybe.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{yeah. ...they should open a pizza joint up there.}
<A>__{janine glares at him, and keenan winces.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{what am i gonna' do?}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{maybe being a woman'll turn out okay. like being an elevated member of the male species.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{elevated "member?"}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{i just mean, maybe he'll learn to like it.}
<C>__{janine}
<P>__{(sarcastic, to keenan)}
<D>__{as hard as that is to conceive!}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{shut up! both of you! what, you want a written guarantee? you're so damn lucky! you're into him, he's into you. super glue! what the hell else do you need to know?}
<A>__{janine looks to keenan with a look of remorse, hopeful...}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{i think you're the female half of me.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{i think you're the macho half of me.}
<A>__{they kiss.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{and i don't know what half of who the hell i am.}
<A>__{they look to luca surprised,... then all three bust out laughing.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{what are you gonna' do?}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{i don't know. i prefer being a guy, but i'm a girl? i'm attracted to max, but i'm in love with michelle? it's like i'm s'posed to be both.}
<A>__{her own admission surprises her.}
<C>__{luca }
<D>__{not too practical. but at least now i know.}
<A>__{she almost laughs, sad, but relieved.}
