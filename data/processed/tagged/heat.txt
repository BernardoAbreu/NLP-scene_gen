<L>__{exterior cedars sinai wide day}
<A>__{a monolith with alienating foregrounds. a bus pulls in on beverly. neil mccauley and a nurse get off. neil carries a paper bag and wears white pants like a hospital attendant. neil is an ice cold professional: very big, very tough. at 42 his short black hair is graying. he spent eight years in mcneil and three in san quentin. he got out and hit the street in 1987. four of the mcneil years were spent in the hole. neil's voice is street, but his language is precise like an engineer's. he's very careful and very good. neil runs a professional crew that pulls down high line, high number scores and does it anyway the score has to be taken down: if on the prowl (a burglary), that's fine; if they have to go in strong (armed), that's fine too. and if you get in their way, that's got to be your problem. his lifestyle is obsessively functional. there's no steady woman or any encumbrance. neil mccauley keeps it so there's nothing he couldn't walk from in 30 seconds flat.}
