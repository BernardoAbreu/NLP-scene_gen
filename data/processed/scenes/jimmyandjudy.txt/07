<L>__{interior jimmy's house jimmy's bedroom night}
<A>__{jimmy's behind the camera interviewing the prostitute who sits up in his bed holding the sheets to cover herself. with the lights on, we can see that she's clearly unattractive. jimmy asks his questions with a gentle confidence.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{okay, so. what was going through your mind when i called you a nigger?}
<C>__{prostitute}
<D>__{this costs you an extra fifty.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{she pauses. you can tell she just wants to leave, but is toughing it out for the extra fifty bucks.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{well, what did it feel like?}
<A>__{long pause.}
<C>__{prostitute}
<D>__{it felt like nothing.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{prostitute}
<D>__{you ain't the first person to call me a nigger when we was fucking.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<P>__{(not surprised)}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{prostitute}
<D>__{johns call me nigger all the time. especially white guys. nothing new. just dirty talk.}
<A>__{long, awkward pause. jimmy doesn't know what to say.}
<C>__{prostitute}
<D>__{that it?}
<A>__{no reply from jimmy.}
<C>__{prostitute}
<D>__{what about you? you like calling me nigger? you get your nut off?}
<C>__{jimmy }
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{prostitute}
<D>__{then why'd ya call me that? jimmy (o.c.) (o.c.) have you ever wondered what it was like to treat someone so completely cruel that it was unthinkable?}
<A>__{no answer.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{i was trying to do the unthinkable and unimaginable when i called you that. i wanted to see if was even possible for me to do that.}
<A>__{they pause.}
<C>__{prostitute}
<D>__{yeah, so?}
<A>__{jimmy speaks softly and confidently.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{i think i want to die. like i don't deserve to live anymore. and that i will never want to do something like that to someone again.}
<A>__{the prostitute finds jimmy's answer endearing.}
<C>__{prostitute}
<D>__{why ya wanna die?}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{because everyone hates me.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{they hate me because i seek beauty and appreciate destruction. they hate my mind, my thoughts, my imagination. they hate everything about me. and i hate them.}
<C>__{prostitute}
<P>__{(trying not to care)}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{yep. everyone. everyone that knows or who has ever met me.}
<C>__{prostitute}
<D>__{your parents don't hate you. look at this room in this big 'ole house you got.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{my parents provide me with food and shelter because they have been conditioned by society into thinking it's the appropriate thing to do. in reality they can't stand to be in the same room with me. they're fascists, brainwashed, and unforgiving. jimmy (o.c.) (cont'd) they dismiss my feelings of ill regard towards them on simple rebelliousness of youth, but that's only because they are patently and intentionally unaware of their own hypocrisies.}
<A>__{prostitute looks bored frustrated again.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<P>__{(accidental condescension)}
<D>__{do you understand me?}
<C>__{prostitute}
<D>__{you wanna know what i think?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{yes, i really do.}
<C>__{prostitute}
<D>__{i think you're a spoiled ass white boy, thinks you everything, but you don't know shit. all you do is bullshit complain and there's folks out there that'd kill for all this.}
<A>__{jimmy doesn't react.}
<C>__{prostitute}
<D>__{i don't feel sorry for you.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{no one is asking you to. thank you for letting me film you.}
<A>__{camera turns off.}
