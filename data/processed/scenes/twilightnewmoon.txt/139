<A>__{beat, she looks at him, wary.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{why? out of guilt?}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{you... think i asked the volturi to kill me because i felt guilty?}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{didn't you?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i went to them because i thought i'd lost you.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{you didn't even want me.}
<A>__{now edward takes her by the shoulders.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{bella. the only reason i left was to protect you. i wanted you to have a chance at a normal, happy life.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{but it was so easy for you to leave.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i had to be convincing. but easy? in my hundred years, i've never had a harder time than what i just went through.}
<A>__{she's beginning to believe him.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{i kept seeing you. visions of you. always protecting me. i thought i was going crazy.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{your own instincts were speaking to you. i wish it had been me. but you're the heroic one. you saved me.}

<D>__{you alright? another nightmare?}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{i'm okay. you don't have to worry.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{last time you said that, you disappeared. you want to talk nightmares?}
<C>__{bella}
<P>__{(sincere)}
<D>__{i'm really sorry, dad.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{just... don't ever do that to me again. okay?}
<P>__{(off her nod)}

<A>__{he kisses her forehead. exits. a beat... she turns to find edward sitting on the bed.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{he won't forgive me easily.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{nope.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{will you? i don't deserve it but... i hope you will. because i honestly have no idea how to live without you.}

<C>__{bella}
<D>__{you won't be able to get rid of me once alice changes me.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{she won't have to. there are ways to keep the volturi in the dark.}
<C>__{bella}
<P>__{(pulling away)}
<D>__{they'll come after your whole family. you'd risk that just to keep me human?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{just? you really don't understand what you'd be giving up.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{i really do.}
<A>__{they look at each other; an impasse. she decides something, grabs her jeans, pulls them on }
<C>__{bella}
