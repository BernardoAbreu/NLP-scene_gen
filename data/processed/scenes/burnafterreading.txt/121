<L>__{interior cox townhouse kitchen day}
<A>__{harry pfarrer stands at the kitchen counter chopping carrots. he is intensely focused and chops very, very quickly, producing slices in high volume. reverse shows katie cox in a chair in the living room, frozen in a look up, a file of papers forgotten in one hand as she gazes over half glasses at harry. his chopping continues unabated. after a long look and much chopping:}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{you seem distracted.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(still chopping)}
<D>__{do i?}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{very distracted. the last two days.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{nn. work.}
<A>__{the chopping continues. katie's eyes shift down to the countertop, back up to harry. another beat.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{... that's enough carrots, don't you think?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{for the salad?}
<A>__{the chopping stops. harry slaps the knife down. he stares at katie, jaw grinding, for a beat.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you know: you're really a very negative person.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{... what?}
<A>__{through grit teeth:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i've tried. to ignore it. and stay upbeat.}
<A>__{katie, unused to backtalk from harry, is stunned. she returns in a manner as hard as his:}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{harry: stop the foolishness.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{stop the foolishness?}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{yes. and behave. you are not talking to one of your...}
<A>__{her fingers form quotes:}
<C>__{katie }
<D>__{... "shithole buddies."}
<A>__{harry glares at her, vibrating with rage. her look at him is equally hard. harry abruptly turns and stomps up the stairs. brief tromping on the second floor. katie sits in puzzled suspense. footfalls descend the staircase. harry reappears at the foot of the stairs with his wedge cushion tucked under an arm. he flings the front door open, goes out, slams it shut.}
