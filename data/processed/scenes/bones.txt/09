<A>__{they walk around the corner and enter a bleak block with at least half the lots burnt out.}
<C>__{palmer}
<D>__{is it too late for me to officially register my growing certainty that this is an extremely bad idea?}
<A>__{farther down, in the center of one side of the street, stands a particularly ominous abandoned building. bones' building. jason ignites a zippo, and they see one loose brick. jason pulls it out and behind it sees a glint of baggy.}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{easy as pie. and twice as tasty.}
<A>__{he opens the bag. it's filled with rock cocaine. angle across the street on the third floor, shotgun sits in his straight backed chair in front of the open center window drinking coffee, cradling his rifle on his lap. sees the frat boys picking up their shit. then he looks out at bone's 'tomb': dark blank windows staring back at him; the building's front door covered with broken vertical boards with jagged pieces missing, looking almost like a jack o lantern's grin. shotgun then looks back down at the boys below. from behind them they hear their car alarm go off.}
<C>__{palmer}
<D>__{someone's screwing with the car!}
<A>__{but from the other way come cops, in a plain wrap car, a hand reaching out and putting the spinning blue light on the roof. no place to run. no place to hide for the boys. they reach for the door of the shuttered building and it opens!}
<C>__{shotgun}
<D>__{yo. you two, get the hell away from there!}
<A>__{but they ignore him and disappear into the darkness inside the gaping maw of bones' building. shotgun shakes his head sitting back down, cradling his rifle.}

<D>__{fools. interior bones' building continuous}
<A>__{inside, the boys huddle in the darkness behind the door, waiting for the cops to pass. the boys look around the decayed gothic interior lit only by the eerie glow of the sodium vapor lights outside. what we last saw as the ornate 70's luxury lobby in bones' day, is now a horror show. walls torn and stained. mold grows in patches on the wall and ceiling. huge cobwebs hang. the furniture's all broken. a gnawing tearing sound makes palmer spin: a rat sticks its head up through the rotted cushions of the couch.}
<C>__{palmer}
<D>__{let's get the hell outta here.}
<A>__{jason shushes him as the room is filled with the flashing blue light of the cop car trawling slowly down the street. from inside they hear the sounds of a car door slamming and cop shoes walking.}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{oh fuck, c'mon...}
<A>__{he gropes his way in the darkness to a staircase. palmer is right behind him as they slip upstairs, deeper into the gaping darkness of the abandoned building. while below them the door opens and cop lights and cop voices penetrate the gloom.}
<C>__{older cop}
<D>__{...not going in there. waste o' time.}
<C>__{younger cop}
<D>__{i saw 'em go in.}
<A>__{and from the boys' high vantage point up the stairs we see the first cop walk in with flashlight drawn. while inside the cop car close angle all we see are two meaty hands unwrapping a wax paper covered pork chop sandwich. the cop, face in shadow, brings the drip ping sandwich up over his huge belly towards his face. inside bones' building the frat boys hold their breath while rats run across their feet. jason slamming his hand over palmer's mouth to keep him from screaming.}
<B>__{down below}
<A>__{the young plainsclothes cop steps deeper into the room, and shines his flashlight at the stairwell.}
<B>__{upstairs}
