<A>__{clicking off his walkie talkie as the crowd presses up to the barricade. officer gantz is in awe as maurice appears from the crowd looking like a ghost of war... a holy apparition. maurice works his way painfully to gantz. gantz looks into maurice's pleading eyes. maurice tries to say something, but nothing can come out... gantz turns away from maurice and picks up one of the barricades. he makes an opening about three feet wide. gantz turns back to maurice, stands at attention, and steps aside.}
