<L>__{interior hallway night}
<A>__{as meg nears the bottom of the stairs, she sees a horrifying sight. it's raoul, ski mask over his face, standing in the doorway of the master bedroom. she screams, he slams the door, she takes off down the hall, reaches the end, throws the door open }
<L>__{interior master bedroom night}
<A>__{ and races into the master bedroom, where raoul is motoring, fast, headed for the panic room, where she can already see burnham, standing in the middle of the open doorway, in front of sarah, wearing harris's shirt and a grim "tricked you" expression. meg hurls herself at raoul, lands clinging to his back. she claws and wrestles with him, gets one hand on his ski mask, tears it from his head. he reaches up to try to stop her from pulling it off his gun slips from his fingers, falls to the floor and caroms off his boot, spinning across the floor away from them. raoul flips her off his back violently, she crunches to the floor, clutching his mask and getting a good long look at his face. he makes a move toward his gun, but she's faster, she's already pawing herself frantically across the hardwood toward it. raoul measures the distance, knows he'll lose, and sprints for the panic room instead. meg turns, looks down at the medicine in her hands, then at the door to the panic room, where raoul is right now reaching up to push the button that controls the steel door. she makes a fast decision and lunges, hurling the plastic bottle of glucogen and the black leather pouch through the gap just before the spring loaded steel door slams shut with tremendous ferocity. and then it's silent. meg wails in agony, pounds on the door. she stands back, chest heaving, sobbing. a looooong moment goes by. finally, a voice comes over the house's intercom system.}
<C>__{raoul }
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{if you leave the house, we'll kill her.}
<A>__{meg sobs.}
<C>__{raoul }
<D>__{if i see a uniform in the house, we'll kill her.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{oh... oh...}
<C>__{raoul }
<D>__{you understand?}
<A>__{on the monitors, meg looks up at the camera in the master bedroom. she nods, terrified. in the panic room, burnham pushes past raoul, at the speaker button, and leans forward. he's approaching exhaustion.}
<C>__{burnham}
<P>__{(into speaker)}
<D>__{i just... i just need forty five minutes.}
<A>__{raoul stands behind him, muttering to himself.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{saw my face, man. saw my face.}
<A>__{on the monitors, we see meg's face, agonized, as she lunges toward the camera, screaming something up at it, the same thing, over and over. but in here her voice is nearly muted, what bleeds through the walls isn't enough to be heard. in the panic room, raoul looks at her image on the monitor, irritated.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{shut up.}
<A>__{in the master bedroom, we abruptly hear her voice, full throated.}
<C>__{meg}
<P>__{(shouting into the camera)}
<D>__{ cine, she needs the medicine! give her the }
<A>__{in the panic room, sarah shivers in a corner, knees pulled up to her chest, staring at the intruders, scared out of her wits, and looking very, very sick. burnham looks at her, musters the most reassuring face he can come up with under the circumstances.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{it's gonna be cool, kid. be outta here before you know it.}
<A>__{no response from sarah. burnham cocks a head, really looking at her.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{hurry up, for christ's sake!}
<A>__{burnham turns, grabs his satchel, and drops to his knees in the middle of the floor. over his shoulder, we can see the face of meg on one of the monitors, shouting into the camera, begging them to give sarah her medicine. using his hand, burnham measures six lengths in from the wall, then digs his fingernails into the weave of the carpet, looking for a seam. he finds one, gets hold of it on one edge, and runs his other hand along the seam till he finds a place where it seems to turn a corner. he stands, hovering over the carpet, and pulls back evenly with both hands. the concealed carpet flap pulls back neatly, with the soft sound of tearing velcro. underneath the flap is the smooth metal door of a floor safe. burnham unsnaps his satchel and gives it a shove. it rolls out and opens up onto the floor, revealing a neat array of safecracking tools. he begins his delicate work, but is suddenly jarred by a pounding on the metal door. he turns, annoyed. meg is still screaming outside the door.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{the hell does she want?}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{i don't know, she keeps screamin' the same thing over and over.}
<A>__{burnham turns, looks at the monitors. on the monitors, meg is staring up at the camera, miming the act of giving herself an injection in the arm. in the panic room, raoul laughs.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{drugs. she wants drugs. what the fuck?}
<A>__{but burnham thinks. his eyes fall on the bottle and the leather pouch she hurled through the door, then whip over to sarah, who sags over into a fetal position on the floor. her lips are moving.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{oh, man...}
<A>__{he crawls over to sarah, puts his ear down next to sarah's lips.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{sarah tries to summon enough strength to speak, but her breath comes hard.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i need...}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{... 'jection...}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{an injection?}
<A>__{sarah nods. burnham points to the pouch and the glucogen, on the floor nearby.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{that stuff?}
<A>__{sarah nods again.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{can you do it yourself?}
<A>__{sarah shakes her head no.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{well, i don't know how.}
<A>__{sarah looks at him, eyes pleading. raoul stands behind burnham.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{i don't fucking believe this.}
<P>__{(to sarah)}
<D>__{you gotta wait.}
<A>__{sarah just looks at burnham. please.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you. you can wait a half hour, can't you?}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{yeah. she can. she's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. you rest, kid. half an hour.}
<A>__{sarah looks terrified, shaking her head no.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{come on.}
<A>__{he starts to pull burnham away, but burnham shakes his hand off, violently. he bends down very close to sarah's lips.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{tell me the truth, okay? what's gonna happen if you don't get this?}
<A>__{sarah swallows, licks her cracking lips. when she speaks, it's breathy, almost inaudible. but the words are clear.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{coma. die.}
