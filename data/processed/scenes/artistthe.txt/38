<D>__{outside in the deserted courtyard, a feather eddies towards the ground, carried by the breeze. george is watching it drift to the ground when suddenly a gust of wind sends it soaring back into the sky. george follows it with his eyes and notices a man crossing between two sets. he looks like some kind of set hand or assistant; a working man in any case. george calls to him. the two men draw close and george asks him what's happening. the man takes the day's newspaper out of his pocket and hands it to george before walking off. george reads: kinograph studios stop all silent productions to work exclusively on talkies.}
