<C>__{jack jefferies}
<D>__{santos, apparently feeling the butterflies on his first professional outing. hailing all the way from the dominican republic, santos wowed the club with his power during spring training. but he's off to a rocky start tonight.}
<B>__{on the mound}
<A>__{jorge comes over from third base as the batter walks to first.}
<C>__{jorge}
<D>__{relax, sugar. it's the same game we played back home. that's all it is. just a game, man. so relax. let's have some fun. okay?}
<A>__{miguel nods. jorge points out the next batter. another dominican.}
<C>__{jorge}
<D>__{see? just like home.}
<A>__{jorge runs back to his position at third. miguel tucks his index finger into his knuckle curve grip. delivers...}
<C>__{umpire}
<D>__{strike!}
<C>__{jorge}
<D>__{that's it! there it is!}
<A>__{and the next pitch... ...is hit sharply to jorge at third, who fires it over to second for one, and on to first for a double play. the crowd goes wild and miguel finally exhales. one, two, three... he mows down the next batter on three consecutive strikes. more applause.}
<B>__{in the dugout}
<A>__{orlando hands him his first strikeout ball. miguel takes a seat, wipes the sweat from his head, then looks down at anne's address scribbled on his forearm. scoreboard later that night we pan right across six innings of zeroes. the swing are leading 4 to nothing in the top of the 7th.}
<B>__{on the field}
<A>__{thwack! the hitter smokes a double off the left center wall.}
