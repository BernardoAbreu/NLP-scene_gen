<L>__{interior chapel day}
<A>__{angle on a rope looped through a hook in the ceiling.}
<B>__{follow the rope down... pass a pair of bloody and bruised}
<A>__{hands, wrists... keep going... end on mike. mike's passed out. he dangles in the middle of the room. he wears an old, moth eaten sports jacket and slacks. a rope gags his mouth. angle on the sickle axe. as it moves towards mike... deacon, a black ring surrounds his injured eye, steps in front of mike, holds the blade centimeters from mike's eye. an eye for an eye? mike wakes and... immediately freaks out. he tries to shake loose, but can't. deacon stares at him, but...}
<C>__{clyde }
<D>__{deacon!}
<A>__{clyde enters. he wears a long garment around his neck, carries a bible.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{that's enough. get him ready.}
<A>__{deacon backs off. he undoes a slipknot on the far wall, which causes mike to come crashing to the floor. deacon lifts mike to his feet, positions him. it's only now mike gets a gander at the room. the fetus jars adorn the far wall. there's a giant wooden cross hanging over a makeshift altar. candles anywhere and everywhere. an old phonograph, one that you crank to play, rests in the corner. clyde places the needle down on a record, cranks the wheel. the music kicks in, classical religious... it's hollow, full of static and futz. mike watches... his eyes open wide, as... the iron door slowly creaks open. angle on a filthy pair of white dress shoes. ropes secure the ankles so movement's limited to inches at a time. shimmying into the room, wearing a dusty, old wedding dress and a flower wreath in her hair is sheryl. her wrists still bound. her mouth gagged. mike and sheryl take each other in. tears spring to sheryl's eyes. she takes another jerky step closer. ida is visible behind her, guides her towards mike. she positions her next to him so that both face the altar. clyde glances to ida who silences the music.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{and jesus answered and said unto them, "each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband. the husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband."}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{amen.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{and so, in the presence of our lord jesus christ, i ask you michael... and you sheryl, do you accept the sacred covenant of marriage?}
<A>__{mike and sheryl stare at clyde. neither flinch. clyde glances to deacon, who immediately steps forward, touches the sickle blade to sheryl's throat.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{i will ask again... do you accept this covenant of marriage?}
<A>__{sheryl nods immediately. mike nods too. clyde signals for deacon to step back. he obeys.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{then by the power vested in me, i pronounce you man and wife.}
<A>__{clyde signals to ida. ida removes sheryl's graduation ring from her finger. she then slides two tarnished gold bands, one on sheryl's finger, the other on mike's. clyde unties the rope securing mike's gag in his mouth, removes it.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{why are you doing this? we did nothing to you people. let us go!}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{you may kiss the bride.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{you fucking people are fucking sick!}
<A>__{clyde's temper flares...}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(stern and cold)}
<D>__{do not use that type of language in this house again. now... kiss the bride or...}
<P>__{(gestures to deacon)}
<D>__{... he'll cut off your lips.}
<A>__{mike stares in horror at clyde, turns to sheryl.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i love you.}
<A>__{mike kisses her briefly on the cheek. clyde smiles satisfied, nods to deacon. he immediately lifts sheryl up and throws her over his shoulder.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{deacon carries her from the room. sheryl cries.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{let her go! sheryl!}
<P>__{(to clyde)}
<D>__{let her go!...please, let her go!}
<A>__{clyde pulls the ropes, hoists mike back into a dangling position. he secures the knot before exiting the room.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{sheryl!}
<P>__{(to ida)}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{please. don't hurt her. whatever it is you want, i will give it to you.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{i know you will.}
<A>__{she stuffs the gag in, secures it in place with the rope. she ties the knot. perfect. ida exits the room. mike is alone. mike tries to yank his hands through the knot. his wrists and hands turn red, his face is flushed...the knot is too tight. he stops. mike takes a breath and tries again. his face and hands are beet red. he pulls and pulls...but the rope doesn't budge. mike exhales. it's no use. he dangles there, helpless.}
