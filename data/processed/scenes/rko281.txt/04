<L>__{int san simeon. dining hall evening}
<A>__{an explosion of color and an immediate swirl of sound we are in the grand refectory the mammoth dining room at san simeon. five long tables are placed end to end. there are about fifty sumptuously dressed guests. william randolph hearst and marion davies preside, side by side, at the center table. hearst is 76 years old. he is a fully commanding figure, towering in both height (six foot two) and personality. he is shaped rather like a pear and moves with a delicacy surprising for such a famously merciless man. although the word ruthless does not begin to do justice to the press baron's animus, hearst is endlessly polite and almost painfully soft spoken. marion is 43 years old, a shimmering and lively presence. in a word that might have been coined for her, she has moxie. while the ravages of alcoholism have left their subtle marks on the edges and attitudes of her face, she can still charm and captivate with almost effortless grace. around hearst's feet sit a collection of his beloved dachshunds. on the other side of the main table, and down a bit, sit welles and mank. we sweep around the table, hearing bits of overlapping dialogue and finally settle on marion and hearst. marion is charming carole lombard and clark gable, who sit beside her. she tenderly rests one hand on hearst's arm as she speaks. marion speaks with an occasionally pronounced stutter.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{and we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t t teeth and i'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place so we set t t traps everywhere. and every morning we would find the t t traps sprung but no mice!}
<C>__{carole lombard}
<D>__{houdini mice.}
<A>__{laughter}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{just wait. so one night i notice pops getting outta bed and sneaking away. and he's got this little p p paper bag with him, right? middle of the night. so i figure the old man's really up to no good this time and i follow him. well i will be g g goddamned if he's not springing all the traps and leaving cheese for the rats!}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{you and that freak disney, in love with the damn rats!}
<A>__{laughter, even from hearst}
<C>__{hearst}
<D>__{they really are sweet little things}
<A>__{meanwhile, across the table welles is rapaciously devouring his dinner as:}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{sigmund freud?}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{kid, you just got your ass kicked on joseph conrad and now you're gonna go to schaefer and tell him you wanna do the id and the superego? stop being so goddamn smart.}
<A>__{mank surreptitiously pours a huge shot of vodka from his flask into his glass as:}
<C>__{welles}
<P>__{(suddenly inspired)}
<D>__{manolete?!}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{who the hell's manolete?}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{the great spanish bullfighter}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{i don't wanna write about no spic.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{no, it's perfect! when in doubt, put on a cape! false noses and faux beards and flowing capes have been the life blood of the actor's craft since the days of lrving and booth. (he flourishes his napkin like a bullfighter's cape.) imagine me in a glittering suit of lights on the dusky andalusian plains }
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{why mr. welles is attempting semaphore}
<A>__{welles smiles across the table. laughter.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{bullfighting, miss davies!}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{and is dear mank your b b bull?}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{my factotum, ally and comrade in arms}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{writer, flunkie, pimp }
<C>__{carole lombard}
<P>__{(wry)}
<D>__{you fight many bulls there in new york, orson?}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{ever met walter winchell?}
<C>__{welles}
<P>__{(expansively, warming into a story)}
<D>__{no, when i was but a tender lad }
<C>__{carole lombard}
<D>__{last week would this be?}
<A>__{laughter. as welles speaks the whole table gradually stops eating and listens to his tale:}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{my father and i made a tour of the grand boulevards of antique europe. and when we were in iberia i had the chance to face the bulls. at the knee of the great manolete i took up the cape and sword }
<P>__{(he uses his napkin and knife to demonstrate)}
<D>__{ across from me stood a mammoth bull reputed to have gored a full seven men to a grisly demise! so with manolete shouting encouragement i flourished . . . i flourished again . . . and the bull charged! across the golden dust it came, thundering like the great minotaur of legend, closer, ever closer, its calamitous hooves pounding into the dirt, shaking the earth as i held the crimson eye of the bull with my own, defying it it was almost upon me and i flourished one last time! the monster swept past! }
<P>__{(he spins his napkin in the air and his knife is now gone, a magic trick)}
<D>__{ and my sword was gone buried in the bloody eye of the beast!}
<A>__{applause and laughter from around the table. then:}
<C>__{hearst}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{you are evidently a man who knows a great deal about bull.}
<A>__{some nervous titters. a beat as welles' smile fades and he stares at hearst.}
<C>__{hearst}
<D>__{of all man's malignity of all his sadism none is more depraved than cruelty to animals.}
<A>__{silence mank gives welles a desperate warning look to keep quiet welles cannot resist speaking:}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{in spain the cruelty would be in denying the beast a fighting end.}
<A>__{a beat as hearst rivets welles with a cold, bland stare deafening silence around the table. then:}
<C>__{hearst}
<D>__{who are you, sir?}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{my name is orson welles}
<C>__{hearst}
<D>__{the actor}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{and director.}
<C>__{hearst}
<D>__{i see. and you are in california for what reason?}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{to make pictures.}
<C>__{hearst}
<D>__{and what pictures have you made?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{none.}
<A>__{a beat. hearst smiles}
<C>__{hearst}
<D>__{well, i wish you luck. it is a treacherous business.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{so i've been told.}
<C>__{hearst}
<D>__{in hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{i will remember that.}
<A>__{a tense beat. marion quickly diffuses the situation;}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{enough hollywood talk! can't anyone talk about anything else?}
<C>__{manx}
<D>__{heard some juicy gossip from metro.}
<C>__{marion}
<P>__{(eagerly)}
<D>__{ooh, dish.}
<A>__{laughter. even from hearst. then the dinner chatter continues. welles cannot keep his eyes off hearst, the press baron draws welles in like a siren. marion gives hearst a little kiss and grabs carole lombard and they leave the table. hearst leans into clark gable to continue talking. welles sits back and reaches for a cigar. mank takes his arm and indicates he should stop, nodding his head in hearst's direction.}
<C>__{welles}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{the man doesn't allow drinking or cigars? this is monstrous.}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{the old man has his own way of doing things}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{he's nothing but a hypocrite. he preaches morality every day in his sordid little papers for everyone else in the world but he lives openly with his mistress.}
<A>__{mank sneaks another shot from his flask}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{buddy, when you own the largest publishing empire in the universe you can do whatever the hell you want. think about it, pal. every day one out of five americans picks up a hearst publication. 30 newspapers, a dozen magazines, a bunch of radio stations and the grand dragon of them all. little miss louella parsons. tends to give you some of that ol' noblesse oblige.}
<A>__{welles studies hearst across the table.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{look at those hands. those are the hands of an artist. a modern caravaggio.}
<C>__{mank}
<D>__{no, baby, those are the hands of a killer}
<A>__{hearst leans down and feeds his favorite pet dachshund, helen, table scraps. he talks to her gently.}
<C>__{hearst}
<D>__{there you are, honey. aren't you a wonderful girl?}
