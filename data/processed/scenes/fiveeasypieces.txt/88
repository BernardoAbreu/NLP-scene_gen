<L>__{interior dupea kitchen night}
<A>__{dinner has concluded and tita moves around the table, distributing cups and saucers. carl is remote and off his feed. spicer attends nicholas, and catherine looks across the table to bobby as he drinks from a bottle of beer. after a moment, a loud belch comes from nicholas and tita quickly requests:}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{don't laugh...}
<A>__{she attempts to stifle her own amusement, as do bobby and catherine, then changes the subject:}
<C>__{tita }
<D>__{what's wrong, carl, you hardly ate anything...}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.}
<A>__{catherine begins pouring the coffee.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{one thing that's hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music, and then just walk away from it, without a second thought...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i gave it a second thought.}
<A>__{tita seats herself at the table, addressing spicer:}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{he looks tired to me, spicer. i think you should put him to bed.}
<A>__{he nods, and as he gets up and wheels nicholas from the room:}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i mean, how could you not play anymore? that's so strange to me...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i have played a few times. here and there. as a matter of fact, i was once a rehearsal pianist for a las vegas musical revue.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{you don't call that music, though.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{of course i do. it's music. you know...}
<A>__{he places his hands on the table and simulates the playing of a rousing production type show stopper, simultaneously vocalizing as he does. though tita and catherine are amused, carl winces disapprovingly and breaks into bobby's act:}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{robert, do you mind?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{nothing. will you excuse us for a while?}
<A>__{he takes hold of catherine's hand and stands up.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{we really don't have to, carl, if you're not feeling good...}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(a bit martyred)}
<D>__{well, maybe if we put the thermaphore on me for a while, first...}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{oh, all right.}
<A>__{and as they move to the door, she glances apologetically back at bobby. deflated and embarrassed, he looks away from tita's sympathetic gaze. after a brief silence, she reaches to a platter on the table.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{do you want some gingerbread?}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(elsewhere)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{with applesauce?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{no, thanks...}
