<L>__{exterior west end cincinnati day}
<A>__{it's the bad part of urban cincinnati in the daylight: projects and blighted row houses. seth and caroline walk with a slouched, alert air. in their mind's eye they are prep school gangsters following a familiar route.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{you know my dad takes eight red cold pills every day? he and my mom have cocktail hour every night, from six to seven, set your clock, two bourbons }
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind }
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{have you done your homework, honey?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{yes, mom }
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{then here's a little bump.}
<A>__{they turn down a street with a lot of activity on it.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{drugs weren't even a problem until a hundred years ago when the white men in power declared them a problem. opiates. but, who was using 'em? chinese immigrants. slave labor. and the darkies up in the inner cities dancing to them evil rhythms of ju ju music. people on the fringe. artists. decadent rich people. and who got scared? white men in power. who's scared today? white men in power. if j.p. morgan and john d. rockefeller ever admitted using, it'd be a whole different story.}
<A>__{two young street dealers fall in step with them. one talks without moving his lips }
<C>__{street dealer}
<D>__{what you want?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{911, and the come down.}
<A>__{one dealer hurries ahead toward the doorway of a falling down building.}
<C>__{street dealer}
<D>__{how much?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{two hundred of c, hundred of the other.}
<A>__{the dealer looks them over. he looks behind them down the street.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{come on... we've been here before.}
<C>__{street dealer}
<D>__{then, let's see your money.}
<A>__{seth and caroline are suspicious. they carefully show money they both have in their front right pockets. the dealer feints like he might grab it.}
<C>__{street dealer}
<D>__{up the steps. you the experts. you know what to do.}
<A>__{they hurry up the steps into the dingy brownstone.}
