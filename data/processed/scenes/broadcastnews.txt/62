<L>__{interior newsroom night (late)}
<A>__{tom is on the phone.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{hi, dad...did you see it? great i will send you a tape...i'm sorry i haven't called. things were a little bumpy for a while. it's not important... i'm fine now.}
<P>__{(what he's been wanting to say aloud)}
<D>__{hey, dad i just may be able to do this job...well, i'm glad you were sure.}
<L>__{interior ernie marriman's virginia home day}
<A>__{ernie is hosting the news staff for sunday brunch they stand around drinking in small groups... aaron is standing with blair and a man in his fifties we have not seen before.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{i don't know why we have to feel defensive about it. newspapers are in business to make money why not us?}
<A>__{aaron looks at her in amazement.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{they criticize us for supposedly pandering while they run wingo games.}
<C>__{grey haired man}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{exactly right. excuse me. i'm paid to mix.}
<A>__{blair and aaron laugh appreciatively as he walks off to another group.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{goodbye, paul.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{take care, paul.}
<P>__{(back to blair)}
<D>__{it takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the president of the news division.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{you think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{no. i think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{my gosh, and for a while there, i was attracted to you.}
<A>__{she walks off.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{wait a minute that changes everything.}
<B>__{on jane}
<A>__{at the bar getting a drink. jennifer enters the scene... and leads jane down the hall until they are standing alone.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{this is very awkward.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{go ahead what?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{ummm it's dumb dorm stuff but i see tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and i'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case i just won't do anything.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{god almighty whew. do i mind? why do i mind? i do mind. what a shock i don't have a right to... i don't think i like him. i know i don't respect him...so what am i talking about what am i saying to you?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{you're saying stay away from him.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(stupefied)}
<D>__{i can't be.}
<A>__{she blinks in wonder.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{we don't have to settle this definitively right now.}
<A>__{jennifer moves toward the drinking table jane, unsteadied by the dose of self revelation, moves towards aaron's circle and scratches his back in friendship... tom approaches an she moves off not wanting to deal with him. she takes a few breaths as she keeps walking. we hear snatches of party conversations, i.e:}
<C>__{george weln}
<D>__{tell me one person who ever left television news to work on a newspaper.}
<A>__{she moves on; tom still following.}
<C>__{ernie's wife}
<P>__{(holding paul's arm)}
<D>__{i felt so proud when he turned down news vice president so we could stay here. suddenly, after all these years, we have a life.}
<A>__{jane turns sees that tom is still looking at her from a few feet away.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(badly)}
<D>__{hi, tom.}
<A>__{she stands there, genuinely frightened. she must deal with him now. he crosses to her.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{it's the firs time i've seen you dressed like this. you look so clean and pretty.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{what do you mean clean?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{at work there's always this sort of film over you.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you're great at taking the edge off a good time.}
<A>__{jane starts twitching. she pauses holds a hand lightly on his arm to steady herself.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{yes. just don't say anything mean for a while. thanks.}
<A>__{she meets his gaze for an instant and, in that instant, loses control for the first time in her memory. she looks strange as she retreats from this glimpse of upheaval.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i've got to find someone. it's important. excuse me.}
<A>__{she walks away.}
<B>__{on aaron and ernie}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{i had the strangest thing happen yesterday. anne and i have been married what? thirty six years... everything fine two days after the promotion came through, i was checking myself in the mirror and she was making a face at me behind my back. so yesterday i looked in the mirror and she was doing it again.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{you didn't say anything to her?}
<A>__{he shakes his head.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{my instincts tell me not to.}
<A>__{annie comes up.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{the office is phoning, honey.}
<A>__{he exits scene as anne watches him go.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{i hope he moves that fast when it's me on the line.}
<B>__{on jane}
<A>__{as she passes a chair with an afghan shawl on the back she picks it up and wraps it around herself, a bit chilled. she sees jennifer on the stairs and moves toward her calling in a too loud, anxiety ridden voice as she goes.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{jennifer. hey, jennifer.}
<B>__{on staircase}
<A>__{jennifer turning as jane whips up the stairs.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{forget what i said you do whatever you want to with him.}
<A>__{she pushes at jennifer a little.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{well, there's nothing i'm going to do right this second.}
<A>__{jane pushes her again.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{but it's a party, right?}
<A>__{jane smiles back feigning female bonding jennifer goes back down the steps and crosses to tom.}
<B>__{full scene}
<A>__{aaron takes in jane, who is taking in jennifer and tom then aaron begins to sense a new dynamic in the room as ernie re enters and huddles briefly with paul... the news president is intent... the two of them walk over to tom and jennifer. we pick up just a few words:}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{this would be a good time to tap that source of yours. he could have an angle or something.}
<A>__{aaron's p.o.v. tom is startled but cool nods his head jennifer is amazed looking at tom with new and even prettier eyes... paul and ernie now move toward jane, a whole flow of movement creating a new energy in the area. jane sheds her afghan as she rises to meet them.}
<C>__{ernie}
<P>__{(to jane)}
<D>__{we want you to exec produce a special report...}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{aaron has come over to join them now in time to hear.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{a libyan plane shot up one of our bases in egypt. it's all still happening.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{let's figure out the field.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{unfortunately, since paul's here, he's made out the assignments... jennifer at the white house... george at the pentagon...martin at state...and we need an anchor since rorish is in his boat, so we're gonna do the whole report this afternoon from here...with tom.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{that's it. i resign as of now.}
<C>__{ernie}
<P>__{(to aaron)}
<D>__{stop it.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{i will tell you what. i will stay if tom knows how to spell gaddafi.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{ernie, as much as i like you, i think i have to tell paul what i think, because this is really sort of obscenely stupid.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{jane, if you want to, go ahead. i don't disagree with you.}
<A>__{jane moves quickly off, awed at the prospect of taking on the big boss.}
<B>__{on jane}
<A>__{as she moves past tom who is talking on the phone, eventually catching up with paul. in the b.g. tom has just heard the "beep" of an answering machine.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{hello, buddy. it's 1:35 and this is tom. you can reach me at the office. it's important. i can use a little help.}
<A>__{jane, because of the proximity to tom is speaking in whispered intensity.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him. not near ready. not by the longest shot. aaron's spent six weeks in tripoli, he's interviewed gaddafi he reported on the eight one story. i think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and i think it's my responsibility to tell you that.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{okay, that's your opinion. i don't agree.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{it's not opinion.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you're just absolutely right and i'm absolutely wrong?}
<A>__{she nods.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it must be nice to always believe you know better. to think you're always the smartest person in the room.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(from her depths)}
<D>__{no, it's awful. oh my, it's awful.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(turning to leave)}
<D>__{we'd better get moving.}
<A>__{as they move out... jane goes to aaron... he moves with her towards the door.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i will tell you later where you going to watch from?}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{watch? }
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i will come by your place, right after...drink, take pills... love you.}
<A>__{she runs out the door. aaron turns mean and mocks jane's last words screwing up his face in a savage burlesque.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{yeah, love you, too.}
