<A>__{the van follows, now directly behind the mercedes, in a procession of vehicles going up the long, curved overpass arcing 100 feet above the 10, toward the 405.}

<A>__{as they approach the crest of the overpass, javal flips a switch on his radio control unit... close road surface of overpass six small semicircles, exact replicas of the stay alert bumps on the white lines of the overpass, explode. they spew hundreds of sharp, triangular nails across the roadway. immediately, scores of tires on passing cars blow out...}

<A>__{causing, 50 yards ahead of the mercedes and van, the most hellacious, gut wrenching, piss your pants, chain reaction pile up you can imagine. dozens of drivers lose control of their vehicles... sideswipe their neighbors... grind against the guard rails. some fishtail into 180's, smashing headlong into the traffic still coming onto the overpass. brakes squeal, people scream, metal crumples, airbags deploy, glass shatters. and then it gets really nasty... a honda gets jammed under a truck hauling cinder blocks. the truck jackknifes, tipping over like a drunken giant. it smashes through the concrete wall and guard rail... along with several cars and their screaming occupants, swept over the edge by the truck like discarded soda cans. they plummet through space, crashing onto the freeway below.}
