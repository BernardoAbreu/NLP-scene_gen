<L>__{exterior radio tower night}
<A>__{the mustang pulls up. will gets out and looks around the deserted place. he holds up the money bag.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i'm here!}
<A>__{in the shadow of the nearby shed, the minivan is revealed as its interior lights come on. the door opens and dwayne emerges, in his mask.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{how much time you got left?}
<A>__{will takes off the jacket and tosses it to the ground. he looks at the timer.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{ten minutes.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{damn. maybe we should just wait around for the money shot.}
<A>__{the guys meet in a clearing. dwayne nods at the bag.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{that the money?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{maybe. where's the girl?}
<A>__{dwayne grins.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{in the van. maybe.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{get her out here. you're wasting time.}
<A>__{will grips the bag close to him. dwayne whistles. the minivan door opens and jay steps out. strapped to his back is the frame pack we saw at his workshop. a long tube connects the pack to the handle of a metal pipe like device in his hand. jay helps kate, still bound and blindfolded, out of the van. they approach dwayne and take up position behind him.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{will, are you there?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i'm here. it's gonna be okay.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{this is a fucking tearjerker.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{just let her come over here.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{i will. but you should know, my associate over there is packing a flamethrower.}
<A>__{jay aims the metal device he has been holding. he hits a button and a pilot light comes on.}
<C>__{jay}
<P>__{(flat)}
<D>__{just do what we say. don't mess around or anything.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{unless either of you can outrun a 25 foot flame.}
<P>__{(gestures to gun in his belt)}
<D>__{or a bullet.}
<A>__{dwayne roughly pulls kate away from jay and shoves her forward. will grabs her, pulls her blindfold off and pushes her behind him.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{get back.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{i gave you the girl. now give me the money.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{how about we get the code out of the way first, since this bomb happens to be ticking so close to all of us.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{fair enough.}
<A>__{dwayne pulls a slip of paper from his pocket.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<P>__{(taunting)}
<D>__{you ready to be a free man?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{just give it to me!}
<C>__{dwayne}
<A>__{will keys in the numbers. the timer freezes and the lock at the hinge opens. will carefully extricates himself from the vest. he lays it down on the ground and steps away from it. his shirt is drenched in sweat from where the bomb sat. will takes a final look at the money bag, then throws it to dwayne. he looks inside, smiles. jay takes a peak.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{it's so fucking pretty, ain't it?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{yeah. it's awesome.}
<A>__{dwayne looks up at will.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{okay, you can get out of here now.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i actually have this sneaking suspicion that once we turn around, you're gonna put a bullet in both of our backs and this is just a guess burn our bodies.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{they say great minds think alike. and in this case, so do we.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i figured as much. that's why i got a gun pointed at you, too.}
<P>__{(loudly)}
<D>__{i got a sniper in the bushes locked on you right now.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{do i look that dumb?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i can't tell, you're wearing a mask.}
<A>__{before dwayne can react, he stops and blinks, something shining in his eyes.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{hey...on your forehead.}
<A>__{dwayne's eyes turn upward, just barely making out the red dot that dances on his forehead.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{son of a bitch. well played.}
<A>__{in the bushes, hidden from sight, chet carefully aims his laser pointer at dwayne's forehead. will grins at dwayne.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{we're gonna walk out of here now. if you shoot, my sniper shoots. i can't guarantee he'll get both of you. but he'll definitely get you.}
<A>__{as will turns away }
<C>__{vaughn }
<D>__{hold the fuck up.}
<A>__{vaughn emerges from the darkness. he looks at will.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{wasn't expecting to see you here.}
<A>__{without warning, vaughn cracks will over the head with the butt of his gun. he goes down hard. kate screams. vaughn points the gun at her and she shuts up. dwayne steps forward with the bag.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{it's all good. we got your money.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{nice mask, dwayne. now throw the money over here.}
<A>__{dwayne complies. as soon as the bag lands, vaughn aims the gun at him.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{hold up. you don't have to do this. i just paid you.}
<A>__{kate looks on, terrified, an unconscious will at her side. vaughn's eyes burn a hole through dwayne.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{i've been hit with a pipe, shot with a pen, and wasted my whole motherfucking day...all because of you and this job.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{i don't know what you're talking about. just take the money.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{i will. and then i'm gonna tie up the two loose ends in the gorilla masks.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{i'm not a loose end!}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{you're a fucking idiot. you are as loose as ends get.}
<A>__{panicked, dwayne's eyes flash over to jay, who tightens his grip on the flamethrower handle. jay catches dwayne's eye. dwayne nods. vaughn sees this.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{what the }
<A>__{jay rears up with the flamethrower. vaughn couldn't be more surprised to see the device jay is holding spit a massive ball of fire at him. vaughn dives to the ground, fires off two wild shots, one of}
<D>__{which }
<A>__{nails dwayne in the shoulder, spinning him backward and knocking him off his feet. kate recoils in horror as: vaughn scurries madly on the ground, intermittently firing, while jay screams and tries to torch him with the 25 foot flame. a hand touches kate's shoulder and she whirls around to find }
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{chet!? what are you doing here!?}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{not now. we gotta take off.}
<P>__{(looks around)}
<D>__{where's will?}
<A>__{kate looks to the empty spot beside her where will just was. flames inches from him, vaughn lines up a desperate shot good news: the bullet only grazes jay's side. bad news: it keeps going and punches through the flamethrower backpack, which happens to be filled with gasoline, which happens to have an incredibly low flash pointerior so the spark from, say, a bullet, would cause}
<B>__{an eruption of flames}
<A>__{meanwhile, will pops up behind chet and kate, clutching the garbage bag.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i got the money. let's get the fuck out of here.}
<A>__{they take off toward will's car. dwayne groggily comes to...no sound, just a ringing. the first thing he sees: vaughn storming toward him, god knows what spewing from his mouth. vaughn levels his gun it doesn't make a sound for two reasons. the second being that it's out of bullets. dwayne fumbles for his own hardware. muzzle flash. vaughn drops to his knees. pulse snatched from him. sound slams back to the tune of jay's screams. dwayne looks over to see his friend in flames, flailing his arms and shrieking. dwayne's head snaps to the other side, where he sees the mustang's tires peel. he tears off his mask, frantically looks around. the money is gone.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{no!!}
<A>__{jay disentangles himself from the backpack, the source of the flames, but his clothes are now ablaze. in his frenzy, he somehow manages to string together two coherent words }
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{dwayne! help!}
<A>__{dwayne gets to his feet as the mustang roars down the driveway. he looks to jay, then to his minivan. dwayne's face: two roads diverge in a wood. which to take?}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{goddamn it, jay!}
<A>__{dwayne sprints over to jay, rips off his jacket and uses it to beat the flames down.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{stop, drop and roll!}
<A>__{jay hits the deck. dwayne continues fighting the flames, finally falls on top of jay with the jacket spread and smothers the last of them out. jay looks up at dwayne with puppy dog eyes.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{you came back for me...you said you never would.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{you didn't hesitate back there, jay. you did good.}
<A>__{jay smiles. flames overtake the field all around them.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{i'm gonna go put a bullet in that motherfucker and get our money. think you can get outta here?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{yeah. go get him.}
<A>__{dwayne hurries toward the minivan. jay stumbles up to his feet and limps off toward the woods.}
