<L>__{exterior woods day}
<A>__{chuck runs through the woods, slipping and stumbling. vines grab at him. the rain is so thick he can hardly see.}
<L>__{exterior woods minutes later}
<A>__{chuck bursts out of the woods into the lava field. smoke pours out of the fedex box. the coals are about to burn through!}
<L>__{exterior lava field moments later}
<A>__{chuck stumbles up the slippery rocks, dragging the smoking box. his face is drenched, desperate.}
<L>__{exterior cave day minutes later}
<A>__{chuck tumbles into the cave just as the coals burn through the fedex box. using the remains of the box, he desperately tries to scoot the coals into a dry spot. one by one, the precious coals go out. dripping water off his hands and face, he pushes a few together with his fingers, ignoring the burns.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{please...please...please...}
<A>__{he stomps on the driftwood and saws at it with his knife. he places this kindling on the coals. they sputter and sizzle. barely catch. he fans them with the box. a tiny flicker catches, then starts to grow.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{firewood. i need firewood.}
<B>__{series of shots}
<A>__{on the beach, chuck desperately gathers more firewood in the driving monsoon. he can barely see. driven by the storm, the waves are licking at the palm grove. he runs through the woods. branches whip at his face. roots tear at his feet, tripping him. he stumbles up the lava field. sliding. struggling. barely able to breathe, the rain is so strong.}
