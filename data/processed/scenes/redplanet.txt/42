<L>__{interior ares kitchen dining sphere night}
<A>__{all six of them are gathered. first dinner in space.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{any space adaptation sickness? vertigo? no? liars. you'll wake up all night long thinking you're falling. promise. i will hear you scream. status?}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{garden's good.}
<C>__{chantilas}
<D>__{didn't lose a plant.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{anything else?}
<A>__{gallagher holds back here a little. not a scientist, not an astronaut. suddenly feels like the most junior member of the crew.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{ahh, commander...bunch of the hvacs jammed from the lift off. reset 'em. they're fine now.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{i will tell you what, unless we pass a recruiting station on an asteroid and you sign up for the military, you can call me kate for the next six months, okay?}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{okay.}
<P>__{(as she waits; he relents)}
<D>__{kate.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{why'd you come, gallagher?}
<A>__{not expecting this one. takes a sec }
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{i did two years as a mechanic at nascar. a year and a half at mcmurdo in the south pole. three years on subs. i had the highest military tech ratings you can get. and i went cross country once with my cousins in a motor home. this didn't seem so bad.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{that's why they called. why'd you come?}
<A>__{a beat, then }
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{you ever been to europe? europe's horrible. it's full of stodgy people whose ancestors didn't have the balls to go to america and try something new. earth is gonna be like europe. you might visit there and admire some old buildings and crap, but you wouldn't want to live there. this was like getting a call to go with columbus to america the first time. but harder. how could you not go?}
<A>__{damn. burchenal grins.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{i don't like europe much either, son. didn't quite figure it the same way, but damnation, you don't turn down a phone call like that, do ya?}
<P>__{(to kate)}
<D>__{you?}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{i spent my entire life training to fly the biggest, fastest thing you can fly. this is it. it's the best job in the world.}
<P>__{(points to santen)}
<D>__{he's going 'cause he got the second best job in space. he's a little pissed about it, but he still came.}
<A>__{she's nailed him so precisely, santen can only wince and look away. pettengill just pipes up. maybe no one's gonna ask and he wants to get it out in the open }
<C>__{pettengill}
<D>__{i was never supposed to come. i came 'cause my boss couldn't. he failed the medical. heart arrhythmia. so here i am. they tapped me on the shoulder, told me i was going to mars. i was supposed to be second in charge of the terraforming office till i died.}
<A>__{chantilas's the last. they turn to him. his reason's a little different.}
<C>__{chantilas}
<D>__{psalm 107, verse 23 they that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters, these see the works of the lord, and his wonders in the deep.' so i figured how much wonder for those in space?}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{santen}
<D>__{you're going to mars because of a poem??}
<A>__{chantilas thinks about it. he could go on about it, but...}
<C>__{chantilas}
<D>__{basically.}
