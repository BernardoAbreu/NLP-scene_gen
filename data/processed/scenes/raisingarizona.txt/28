<A>__{as hi bursts in. tracking on him as he runs down the broad front aisle, head whipping as he runs, looking up each perpendicular lane, searching for something. he turns up one of the last lanes, races along it and grabs a carton of huggies, still on the flat run. he emerges into the broad back aisle and runs along it, but at the first perpendicular lane he hits, we see officer steensma, gun leveled, at the other end. he fires. hi keeps running. the policeman is running along the front aisle, keeping pace with hi running along the back aisle. he squeezes off shots at hi as each lane gives him the opportunity. hi abruptly stops between lanes and doubles back, losing the policeman. he runs down the second lane he comes to toward the front of the store. the pack of dogs appears at the end of the lane and thunders up toward hi, braying at the top of their doggy lungs. the lead doberman holds in his teeth a paper 7 eleven cap. hi reverses again, and emerges into the back aisle. bang! a pyramid of cranberry juice explodes at his shoulder. the policeman has been waiting at the end of the back aisle; he aims once again. hi plunges down the next lane but is brought up short as ka boom! five jars of applesauce explode in front of him. hi looks. standing in the raised platform cubicle at the front of the store is the store manager, a fat man in a white short sleeved shirt with a lit cigarette dangling from his mouth. the manager cracks open his shotgun and inserts two more cartridges thoonk thoonk in the smoking chamber. hi doubles back once again toward the back aisle. he is still several paces from the end of the lane when the policeman appears there, squaring to face him. the policeman is in front of him. the manager is blowing out groceries on the shelves behind him.}

<A>__{as he coolly levels his police special and takes aim at hi . policeman's pov still on the dead run, hi is flinging the carton of huggies. the carton rockets straight at the camera.}
<B>__{back to policeman}
<A>__{futilely raising his gun to avoid impact: the huggies catch him square on the chest. the force makes him stumble one fatal step backwards into the back aisle where: crash he is hit broadside and bowled over by a rocketing shopping cart, propelled by an hysterically screaming shopper.}

<A>__{racing on down the back aisle, bellowing.}
<B>__{her feet}
<A>__{tracking from in front. beyond her we can see the pack of furiously barking dogs, nipping at her heels. they boil over the prostrate officer steensma, and this is the last we see of him in this movie.}
