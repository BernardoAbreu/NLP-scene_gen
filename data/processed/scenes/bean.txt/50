<A>__{mr. bean is ready to leave his room. battered old suitcase in hand, he checks the room from the doorway. every conceivable thing that can be opened cupboards, drawers, fridge sports an oversized padlock. even bean's old g.p.o. phone has one on its dial. bean looks across to his teddy, who is lounging on a miniature chair, inside an up sided cardboard box. the box is sits on an armchair. a hand written sign, taped to its roof reads: 'teddy hotel' followed by three stars. a smaller sign informs us that the hotel is: 'full'. bean is just about to leave but stops to consider. taking a felt tipped pen, he adds two more stars on the hotel hoarding, as a treat. he then, slightly, incomprehensibly, begins to tie string it around various objects in the flat. the fridge the corner of a chair, a couch leg.}
