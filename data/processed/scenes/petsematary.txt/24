<A>__{he's standing in the driveway by the front of the car, utterly forgotten in the heat of the moment. his diaper is sagging quite a bit; the boy needs a change. he stares toward the scene of the accident for a bit, then loses interest. camera follows as he walks down the side of the station wagon, little bare feet slapping on the asphalt. he stops for a moment at the back, looking at the cat carrier, which louis never got around to opening. church is staring hopefully out through the mesh.}
