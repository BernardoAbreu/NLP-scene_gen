<B>__{a grand marquis}
<A>__{squeals around the corner, lurches to a stop alongside the mercedes. four men get out flashing badges. in a moment they're hustling eighteen toward the car, stiff arming the chauffeur. as the girlfriend cries and the gossip among the parishioners begins... the grand marquis pulls away.}
<L>__{interior grand marquis day}
<A>__{they shove eighteen down to the floor of the backseat. these guys are not the police. a switchblade is flicked open. practiced hands slit the boy's sunday suit from the base of his neck to his heels. eighteen yelps as the blade draws blood across one calf. duct tape is wrapped around his hands, eyes, and head.}
