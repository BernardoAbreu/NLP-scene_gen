<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior a roadblock on the edge of sebaco day}
<A>__{price and alex are ordered out of their car by a very unfriendly guardia soldier. he is ordered to put down his camera bag. the hood and trunk are opened.}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{venga.}
<A>__{they are led to a shed by the roadside, a tire repair shop, where they sit down in an oily, dusty shack. they watch the soldiers: p.o.v. the soldiers tearing up the rental car, pulling off door panels, looking for weapons.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i bet you go through a few rental cars.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{don't worry. i put this in your name.}
<A>__{price and alex jerk to life at the sound of screaming in the distance. a volley of gunfire follows. price moves quickly into an adjoining shed and looks through a crack in the wall: p.o.v. an execution squad in a field as several bodies are being hauled away. two soldiers reload their guns. pan to a figure moving behind a wall oates.}
<B>__{price hurries through the shacks toward the execution wall}
<A>__{as alex calls to him and hurries after price is single minded. as he moves through the shacks we hear another volley of fire, and price bursts into a clearing to see:}
<B>__{two trucks being loaded with bodies as oates supervises.}
<A>__{price steps into the clearing face to face with oates. they look at each other for several beats before anyone speaks. oates is slightly embarrassed.}
<C>__{oates}
<D>__{no pictures, eh? might look bad.}
<A>__{oates smiles half way; price looks around at the bodies.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{you get paid by the body or by the hour?}
<C>__{oates}
<D>__{i get paid the same way you do. what the fuck you doin' in sebaco this place's about to blow... ain't it?}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{you didn't have to nail pedro.}
<C>__{oates}
<D>__{who's pedro?}
<A>__{alex arrives and tries to pull price back at the same time he sees the bodies and is sickened at the sight.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{oh my god...}
<A>__{a body is carried through and loaded on a truck. oates's tone is one of explanation rather than defense, very matter of fact.}
<C>__{oates}
<D>__{there's a motherfucking war goin' on, pal... lotta sad stories.}
<A>__{price mumbles and wanders to the next truck a few feet away, and as he sees it he stops short, speechless. he points: the bodies of the priest from leon and the businessman, figures we saw at rafael's camp, sit in the back of the truck. they are splattered with blood and lifeless. price is shaken.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{why them? why them?!}
<A>__{oates has to look to see who he's talking about, and price loses his cool.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{you're a cocksucker!}
<C>__{oates}
<D>__{i don't suck no dick, man...}
<A>__{price grabs oates and pushes him backwards but oates responds like an animal. the two men go down in a heap and lash out at each other in the dust. their fighting is largely ineffective, though very physical, until oates asserts himself and knocks price against a wall, breaking free to pick up his automatic rifle that he handles with one hand and shoves it into price's face.}
<C>__{oates}
<D>__{i'd prefer not splattering your brains in a dump like this i got priorities.}
<P>__{(to alex)}
<D>__{guy wants to be a hero, pops, get him outta here before he's a number.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{be a shitty little town to buy it in.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{russell, let's get outta here.}
<C>__{price}
<P>__{(to oates)}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<C>__{oates}
<D>__{guy's got a sense of humor, old man.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{got any dope? tough place to find decent dope?}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{why them?}
<C>__{oates}
<D>__{them? c'mere. you too.}
<A>__{he leads them under an awning nearby where a couple soldiers sit. a small table, some weapons, two shallow boxes, food, beer. oates rummages around to find what he wants, and pulls out: a handful of photographs, mostly snapshots, odd sizes, with names written on them. he sifts through them quickly and we see an assortment of photographs of nicaraguans. he finds what he's looking for and holds up: price's photograph of the priest and the businessman, the picture taken in rafael's camp, blown up, cropped, and identified. the faces are circled.}
<C>__{oates}
<D>__{if your mug shows up in this box... and ya try to make it through sebaco... i owe yer ass.}
<A>__{this information hits price in the gut, and he is seized with fear.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{who gives you the pictures?}
<C>__{oates}
<D>__{what's this, an interview? i ain't that dumb.}
<A>__{price turns, he doesn't want to face it.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{off the record.}
<C>__{oates}
<D>__{off the record... some pachuco gives 'em to me. ain't none of my business, but i heard he gets 'em from a frog.}
<A>__{oates pulls another picture from a different box and holds it up:}
<B>__{photograph of isela}
<C>__{oates}
<D>__{nice, eh?}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{she dead?}
<C>__{oates}
<D>__{not yet.}
<A>__{alex grabs price and heads back toward the roadblock.}
<C>__{oates}
<D>__{whatya' expect? we're the ones gettin' our butts kicked.}
