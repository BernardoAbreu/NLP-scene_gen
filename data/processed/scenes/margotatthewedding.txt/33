<L>__{exterior vogler house evening}
<A>__{margot's fist is raised about to knock on the front door. she stops herself. she puts the note on the welcome mat and holds it in place with the child's shoe. she wanders around to the back of the house. she looks into a lighted window: it's a white tiled bathroom. a wet brown animal body covered in clear plastic is balanced on the sink. mr. vogler tears into the plastic. the carcass is butterflied open exposing the innards and ribs. mrs. vogler runs the tub. she pours salt from a box in the water. the man slides his hand in her waist band. she rubs against him. margot chews her cuticle. the man saws the legs. his arm jerks back and forth, straining to cut through the bone. sweat pours down his temples. margot raises her hand to her face and presses against the window. she peers through her fingers. the blade pierces the bone with a violent release and the hoof falls to the floor. margot moves to another window. the pig's face now looks at her. blood drips and leaks into the crevices of the tile. the woman brandishes a syringe filled with an orange liquid. suddenly a face appears in the glass. margot leaps back. it's a thin boy. he says something. the family turns to the window. the father flicks off the bathroom light. from inside margot illuminates like an apparition. margot scampers into the trees. she pushes through branches, her shirt tears. she runs.}
