<L>__{interior school hall. day}
<D>__{jenny with cello sits in the string section. everyone is getting settled, tuning up, latecomers still arriving. along the row from jenny, tuning his violin, is a nice looking boy of her age, graham, and she waves at him. two 13 year old boys sitting between them wave too, parodically, and then blow kisses, much to graham's embarrassment and jenny's fury. the silly boys dissolve in fits of giggles: this is clearly one of the funniest moments of their lives until one of them farts noisily and, it would appear from all the frantic gesturing, pungently. the comic value of the fart tops even the comic value of the wave, and they are scarcely able to stay seated, such is their mirth.}
