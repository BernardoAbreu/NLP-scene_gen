<ACTION>__{Clock. It is twenty minutes to one -- and then moves slowly into the crowd of busy mid-day business jumble. CAMERA pushes through crowd and passes by the foot of the steps that lead up to the restaurant. In its journey, it passes Kringelein looking up. He is not pointed. THE CAMERA then saunters -- getting a slow profile movement across -- near Senf's desk. Senf is very busy. THE CAMERA now passes -- profile -- the desk of Senf. General action. Senf stands before his background of slots and keys. WE PROCEED until we are facing the elevator. At that moment the elevator is opening. Among the people who emerge is Suzette, who moves too quickly for us to distinguish who she is. THE CAMERA PANS quickly with her and in the distance we hear her saying to Senf:}

<DIAL>__{Cancel Madam Grusinskaya's car.}
<ACTION>__{The CAMERA now backs away from the scene into the BAR. (a section.) It backs to the back of the bar and proceeds -- in profile -- behind the backs of the barmen. A mixed crowd of people drinking before their lunch. We pick up the Doctor, leaning his head upon his hands, looking into space. The woman next to him, a noisy blonde, is laughing. The doctor glances up at her -- she glances at the doctor. She and the audience see the scarred side of his face -- the laugh dies on her lips and she turns suddenly to her companion, who is the Baron. We do not get much of a chance to see him because at that instant he is glancing at his watch, his shoulders are turning away from THE CAMERA and he moves out towards the lobby. BACK UP a few feet and LAP DISSOLVE : as you move into the main aisle of busy room in restaurant. Great activity of waiters. The bustle and activity of fashionable lunchtime. A string orchestra is playing. Among other things, we pick up the smiling face of the pompous Maitre d'hotel, he has apparently just shown someone important to a table. THE CAMERA watches his face and follows him. His face just as CAMERA reaches service table. The pompous Maitre d'hotel now becomes a thing of drama as he demands of a waiter:}

We see the soup fall and hear the scream of a woman before showing her agonized face -- She has been scalded. General steamy confusion. The chef has filled the plate. WE PROCEED the buss-boy out. Half way down the aisle, the waiter takes it from him. THE CAMERA follows the waiter who places the soup before Mr. Preysing. Preysing has been waiting, with his serviette carefully tucked in his collar. His spoon is in his hand. A horrible man, ready for action. The soup is in front of him, he tastes it, pushes it away, frowns, we feel he is going to tear the place down.}

Slowly and amusingly the chambermaid, tired and dragging, enters the room. He is looking for an opportunity to dash through the door. After all, this maid should be an easy person to get around. We have a feeling he wishes to dash through the door. The chambermaid might be singing the same tune that we hear from Preysing's radio. The telephone commences ringing. Chambermaid does not answer it but continues her duties. At last, because of the noise of the telephone, she picks it up and speaks.}

<ACTION>__{She is about to replace the receiver. She sits with it in her hand, unreplaced. The music has stopped. The room is strangely silent. Behind her the Baron peers from the closet. Her head sinks down upon her hands. A funny, singing noise comes from the telephone. She lifts the receiver to her ear. In a very strange voice, the voice of Opehlia, she speaks:}
<CHAR>__{GRUSINSKAYA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(with great humility)}
<DIAL>__{Oh -- I'm sorry, yes... I have finished.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(she replaces the receiver)}
<ACTION>__{The foregoing scene is much better played than described. It is in fact, ballet. Quite calmly, Grusinskaya finishes the notes on the table. She folds it up and places it in a prominent place on the table, or hangs it over the telephone. She crosses to the window pulls back the curtains -- the Baron has been hiding behind a few minutes before. We see the Baron watching. He glances at the door quickly. "No, there is not time." She is returning calmly. She crosses to the dressing table and takes the veronal out of a drawer. She looks at it thoughtfully, her lips are trembling a little. She moves to the radiator as if to seek warmth. She sinks into a chair and her head droops over her folded hands which contain the veronal, she seems to pray. The Baron comes from the closet -- now is his chance, he looks at the door but can't make it. Looks on the floor for the key which Grusinskaya has previously thrown there, his eyes fall upon the note on the telephone -- he reads it. It is a death farewell note to Suzette -- do not insert it. At this moment she has finished, the Baron returns to his hiding place. She makes the sign of a cross and goes to her bed. She looks around nervously, apprehensively -- like a deer who has heard something, then reassured. She places the veronal on the night table beside the glass of water. She is quiet and deliberate. She arranges the pillows under her head and lies down. She reaches for the bottle of veronal and empties it generously in her hand. She has to lean away upon one elbow, from the Baron's position, in order to balance herself. The Baron steps like a cat from his hiding place. He goes to the bedside noiselessly and stands there. She reaches for the glass-her hand stretches out for the glass. The Baron takes her wrist suddenly. She turns quickly looking at him. The glass falls to the floor with a crash and breaks. As she moves, the veronal falls out of her hands upon the bed. She struggles up to a sitting position.}
<CHAR>__{BARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Please, do not be alarmed, Madam.}
<ACTION>__{She glances up at him. She is bewildered. She seems to be coming out of a trance. Again she wants to jump from the bed.}
<CHAR>__{BARON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Careful -- there's broken glass on the floor.}
<ACTION>__{Now she becomes conscious of almost nakedness. She draws her kimono tightly around her, glances across the wide expanse of bed. We see her consider passing over that way, but she is now a woman again -- a woman of the earth -- it would be a silly movement.}

<ACTION>__{She gets up quickly and crosses, putting on her robe which was lying across the back of a chair. Her first movement is not one of alarm but of -- shame. She draws her robe more closely around her and looks at the Baron puzzled. She thinks, dreamily, "What is this?" She glances back at the veronal and the bed showing us plainly that this man must have watched her preparation for bed. We get a sense of relief with her. She is trembling. The Baron has controlled his nerves perfectly. He senses his danger. He is caught red-handed with five hundred thousand marks worth of pearls in his pocket. He is wondering if she will ring the bell. For an instant he thinks of escape. He could dash for the balcony. He could strike her dead or silence her with threats. There is in the room an intoxicating sense of romance and danger.

He is about to take it, he smells it, a sudden impulse of well-being surges over him. He flings the medicine away.

With a swift movement, Flaemmchen dashes towards the door. It is locked. She rushes back as if to cut through her own room.
