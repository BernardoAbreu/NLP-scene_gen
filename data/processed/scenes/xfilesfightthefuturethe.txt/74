<D>__{i'd been told as much.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{you're saying the bombing was a cover up. of what?}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{i don't know. but i have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm in serious violation of medical ethics.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{we're being blamed for these deaths. scully, i want to know what this man died of. don't you?}
