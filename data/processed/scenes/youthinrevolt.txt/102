<A>__{nick reaches the door and gently knocks. but it's sheeni's ogre of a father who answers the door and stares at nick sternly.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{uhm, hello. is sheeni available?}
<C>__{mr. saunders}
<D>__{she most certainly is not. as a matter of fact, we've banned you from her life, nick twisp.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{mr. saunders}
<D>__{trent preston informed us that not only were you moving here to pursue my daughter, but that you're not even mentally handicapped, and thus molested my wife in the shower of sound mind and body.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{that rat fink fuck!}
<C>__{mr. saunders}
<D>__{you watch your language. this is a christian home. we're sending sheeni to les ecole des arts and literatures in santa cruz.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{santa cruz! but she'll be miserable without me. we're in love.}
<A>__{the ogre snorts in condescending amusement.}
<C>__{mr. saunders}
<D>__{then i guess it's a good thing trent is going there too. she'll have someone to console her.}
<A>__{and with that, mr. saunders slams the door so hard in nick's face that the entire two story mobile home rocks back and forth.}
