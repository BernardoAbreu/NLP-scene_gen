<A>__{frank steps into the foyer with emma. she is a warm, matronly woman who does a fine job running the house without standing on custom.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{i will tell you quite honestly, mr. ford, i don't know where mr. devaney is. did he say he'd be here?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{then he probably is. let me look.}
<A>__{she leads frank into a large, unused formal parlor. there are dustsheets over the furniture and the walls are being repainted. on a number of tv screens scattered around, rachel's latest video (the one we saw in the opening titles) is continuously playing. the sound of the song itself "i have nothing" comes softly from concealed speakers.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{please make yourself at home. can i get you anything?}
<A>__{frank demurs and emma disappears back through the foyer. frank watches her go, then moves off into the house in the opposite direction. it's obviously undergoing a major redecoration. painters, decorators and designers come and go, oblivious to frank's presence.}
