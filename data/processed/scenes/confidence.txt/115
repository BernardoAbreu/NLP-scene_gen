<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior bulldog gym day}
<A>__{boxers at the bags, a jumping rope, etc... jake and lily stand in front of the king pin, who's dressed in shorts and a t shirt. he wears boxing gloves and headgear. lupus and harlin stand vigil by the sparring ring.}
<C>__{king pin}
<D>__{how much?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i think two million.}
<C>__{king pin}
<D>__{what do you need from me? permission? go! if you can fleece him for two million, then do it, kid.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i need you to stake me.}
<C>__{king pin}
<D>__{stake you?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i need you to stake me. i can't do it without it. it's just a couple hundred grand. taken out of our cut when we're done.}
<A>__{king pin eyes jake suspiciously for a second.}
<C>__{king pin}
<D>__{that's more than you already owe me. what happens if you fuck this up?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{nothing ventured, nothing gained.}
<C>__{king pin}
<D>__{hey skippy? do i have the word "chump" tattooed on my forehead?}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{mr . king, i think }
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(w a look)}
<D>__{hey, i got it! take some mental notes. you just might learn something here.}
<A>__{lily just shrugs and rolls her eyes.}
<C>__{king pin}
<D>__{listen, scooter }
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{no, you listen. we're partners now and even though i'm running the show for you, i'm still running the show. that means i get a little respect. so i don't want to hear anymore of this scooter, buddy, junior, skippy, tiger, bullshit. it's jake.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{and i gotta tell you, for a guy who spends all his time in a gym, you could be in better shape.}
<A>__{a few of the boxers training around stop and turn. the king pin lowers a glare at jake.}
<C>__{king pin}
<D>__{take off your shirt.}
<A>__{jake looks behind him to see harlin looming.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{king pin}
<D>__{i said take off your fucking shirt.}
<A>__{a few more boxers stop and turn. jake notices he's being watched. the king pin takes a step towards jake...}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{fine. you want me to take it off, i will take it off.}
<A>__{jake unbuttons his shirt and stands in front of the king pin, arms crossed. it's getting weird.}
<C>__{king pin}
<D>__{look at you, you skinny prick.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{you're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything, are you?}
<A>__{the king smiles and begins to take off his shirt. harlin and lupus share an uncomfortable glance. the king strips down to the waist and reveals an incredibly large, incredibly round stomach which he slaps loudly.}
<C>__{king pin}
<D>__{come here. feel this.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{no thanks. i'm good.}
<C>__{king pin}
<D>__{come here!}
<A>__{the king grabs jake's hand and puts it on his stomach. it just got weirder. now the whole gym has stopped, everyone focused on jake and the king pin.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{you guys are freaking me out.}
<C>__{king pin}
<D>__{shut up. feel that? that's solid muscle. not an ounce of fat. go ahead. punch it.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i am not going }
<A>__{the king starts to get that look again. jake winds up and punches the king in the stomach. he shakes his fist in pain.}
<C>__{king pin}
<D>__{come on. harder.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i think i just broke my hand.}
<C>__{king pin}
<D>__{harder. remember, i killed your buddy.}
<A>__{jake's demeanor changes as he winds up and hits the king as hard as he can. the king just smiles.}
<C>__{king pin }
<D>__{all muscle.}
<A>__{the king then hits jake back in the gut with surprising speed. jake falls to his knees, but the king's right there. with one arm he pulls jake up and starts to pummel him in the stomach with an unbridled visciousness. jake spits up blood as the king hurls him face first into the ring.}
<C>__{king pin}
<D>__{maybe it's true. maybe you can't cheat an honest man. me? i'm about as dishonest as they come and that's the truth. but if you even think about trying to con me they'll find fucking pieces of you in each of the five boroughs. pieces of you, pieces of her, pieces of your whole crew. can't be any mare honest than that. i will stake you, but that's three hundred fifty you're in the hole and consider the juice running. now go make me proud.}
<A>__{harlin and lupus lift jake up. lily looks at jake with a pained expression.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{you get all that?}
<A>__{everyone in the gym goes back to their workouts.}
