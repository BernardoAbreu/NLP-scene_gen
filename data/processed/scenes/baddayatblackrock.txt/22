<A>__{macreedy stops, as does smith. he looks keenly at smith as he takes from his inner jacket pocket a half dozen letters...}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{i wrote these letters to komako. they weren't forwarded. they were returned address unknown.}
<P>__{(he smiles grimly at smith)}
<D>__{so i guess there's nothing you can do for me, after all.}
<A>__{smith opens his mouth to reply when the noise of a jeep o.s. interrupts him. the jeep comes into shot. liz brooks, at the wheel, cuts the engine and jumps out. smith ambles silently to a wall and leans against it. liz reaches behind the driver's seat and hoists, with both hands and some effort, a five gallon drum of axle grease from the floor of the jeep. as she rests it on the rear fender...}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(going to her)}
<D>__{need a little help?}
<A>__{the girl looks at smith, who has made no attempt to help her.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{i can manage.}
<A>__{she lifts the drum to the ground.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{well, i need a little help.}
<P>__{(she looks at him questioningly)}
<D>__{i'd like to rent your jeep.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{it'll be two dollars an hour, gas extra, and ten dollars for my time.}
<C>__{smith}
<P>__{(to liz)}
<D>__{aren't you going to ask him where he wants to go?}
<A>__{liz looks from smith to macreedy, puzzled.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{he wants to go to adobe flat.}
<A>__{liz hesitates. macreedy notes her confusion as her eyes seek smith's for instructions. quickly he moves in...}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{the road's marked?}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{yeah. it's about six seven miles down...}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{then i won't need your time.}
<A>__{macreedy hands her a bill. she fumbles with it, not knowing what else to do. her eyes drift to macreedy's stiff arm...}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(uneasily)}
<D>__{i thought you might... need a little help.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{i can manage.}
<A>__{he steps toward the jeep as...}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{liz. do you have a license to rent cars? you could get into trouble.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{it's all right. i won't mention it to the sheriff.}
<A>__{he steps into jeep and, with one hand expertly manipulating the controls, drives off. med. shot smith and liz smith turns his attention to the girl...}
<C>__{smith}
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{you shouldn't have done that.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{i thought it would be better if he went out there and got done with it.}
<P>__{(smith looks at her sharply)}
<D>__{i mean, what could he find out?}
<A>__{for a moment smith doesn't answer. instead, with a half frown, he lifts the bill macreedy had given her from liz's hand.}
<C>__{smith}
<P>__{(as he studies it)}
<D>__{this is liable to be the hardest ten dollars you ever earned in your life.}
<A>__{he crumples it, pokes the wad in her hand and walks off down the street as...}
