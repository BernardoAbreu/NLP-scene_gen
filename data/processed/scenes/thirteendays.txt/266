<A>__{kenny walks down the sidewalk, drawn toward the ellipse. the sixth grade football players sweep forward with a running play. kenny scans them, searching, his breath coming hard.}
<L>__{exterior ellipse day}
<A>__{he reaches the edge of the open field. and then he spots the name on the jersey: o'donnell. it's kevin. the players relinquish the ball and the offense comes off the field. kevin sees his dad.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{hey! dad!}
<A>__{kenny manages a smile as kevin trots over. kevin pulls his helmet off. they stand there a long beat, kenny desperate to take him up, abandon his post... but he doesn't.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{hey, sport. you winning?}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{but kevin sees the turmoil in his father's face.}
<C>__{kevin }
<D>__{is everything going to be okay, dad?}
<A>__{kenny's forced smile is answer enough.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{yeah, kev. everything's gonna be fine.}
<A>__{but kevin knows. together they know. the end of the world is at hand.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{i guess you won't be coming home tonight.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{i, uh...}
<A>__{suddenly a car honks. kenny turns around. bobby is leaning out the rear passenger window of his limo. and he sees what kenny is doing. he doesn't want to cut in, but has to.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{kenny! we need to talk.}
<A>__{kenny looks back at his son.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{get back out there, kid. remember to hit 'em hard.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{what about you? where are you going?}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{back to work.}
<A>__{kevin puts his helmet back on his head. kenny watches as kevin jogs off to rejoin his team. kenny turns his back on his son, and strides for bobby's limo, dying inside.}
