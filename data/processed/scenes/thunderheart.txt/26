<L>__{ext maisy blue legs house black tail district day}
<A>__{a trailer sits off from the river in beaten solitude. there are two junked cars and one burned black. wind blows across deep bald tire tracks. ray walks slowly beside them, surveying, following them to a place where they become puckers and skids next to a dilapidated outhouse. there is a shotgun blast in the side of it. ray studies it, enters the outhouse. exits, and walks the rutted gumbo earth to where it meets rolling hills of golden grass. he stands here, mesmerized. chickens scratch around in the dirt. like so many far off res homesteads, this is a haunting place. made more so by a persistent squeaking, a rusty, metallic squeal coming from }
<B>__{a water pump}
<A>__{across the yard, where maisy blue legs, a sioux elder, works the handle. she wears thick bifocals and keeps her hair under a bandanna. no water comes forth from the pump, and she tries again and again until she breaks a sweat. and then she sees the waal'cu standing out there. urgently, she turns and starts back to her trailer with an empty coffee can. ray starts after her.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{mrs... blue legs? can i ask you a few questions }
<C>__{maisy}
<P>__{(1 3 res speed)}
<D>__{ go away. leave us alone...}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{ma'am, please }
<A>__{she mounts the metal steps. ray is losing her. he gets a foot on the bottom step, and attempts something he does not want to do.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{mrs. blue legs. i'm indian.}
<A>__{halfway through the screendoor, maisy turns and looks at the young man in suit and shades.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i'm sioux.}
<A>__{maisy lowers her bifocals, studies him. then walks in, slaps the door shut, and locks it. a towel hung as a shade folds down. ray lingers at the bottom of the steps.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{yeah, right.}
<A>__{and he walks around the side of the trailer, looking at the ground. in the gaping space between the trailer blocks, and the grass, there is much junk stored, and ray kneels to look. he is drawn to a pair of cowboy boots, caked with dried mud. he picks up a boot, looks at the sole, then touches the mud. his fingers break through the hardened crust and come back moist and blue. he looks at this sniffs it. there is a tense, water torture like tempo coming from the old pump where water barely drips onto a hub cap in the dirt. ray sets the boot down. goes to grab the other boot and a western diamond back rattler coils out from the shade of the boot, rattling and hissing from white mouth and three inch fangs, and ray has done a backflip and roll, slapping his shoulder holster and pulling lead and blam! blaaam! he unloads two, and the reptile is so dead, there's not even enough snake left to make a truck stop key chain. he kneels there, flushed in the face, holding his breath and double clutching his gun. the shots echo through the badlands like the aftermath of dynamite. from inside the trailer, he can hear crying. a low moaning. praying softly.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{shit. mrs. blue legs! it's okay!}
<A>__{then his radio cracks in.}

<D>__{meet me at base. over.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{cooch. you're my hero.}
<A>__{ray looks down at the dead snake, still rushed from it, and he hurries out of there.}
<B>__{in the shade of the trailer}
<A>__{the snake's rattle moves spasmodically, still kicking with reflex.}
