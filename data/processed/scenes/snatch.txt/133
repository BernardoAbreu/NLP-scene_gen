<A>__{there is a wake in motion. we cut to micky and turkish. it is obvious that a lot of hard core drinking has been going on, and there is an irish band playing. the is a coffin in the middle of a caravan that is closed for obvious reasons i t ' s surrounded by heavy looking lads. the is a man dancing on one of the tables.}
<B>__{this scene i shall be filling in shortly but i am afraid you have to wait till i have been to a irish wake. all as i know is that rather ironically they are fun. however i like juxtapositions of micky singing and crying simultaneously.}
