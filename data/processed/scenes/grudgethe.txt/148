<A>__{peter tears down the stairs and runs for the front door, passing a mirror he freezes. he saw something in the reflection as he passed. something wrong. he takes a step back and looks it's not his reflection in the mirror. it's kayako. peter stares at the image in disbelief. then he notices toshio standing next to kayako, looking up at her. as peter slowly turns to look down, a small pale hand slips into his own. peter jerks backward in shock as a series of images, the origin of "the grudge", flash by: takeo, looking down at the journal, reading his wife's words, his face contorted with rage... he turns to see kayako, home from work, standing in the doorway... kayako running down the steps, takeo chasing her, tackling her before she can reach the door... sitting on top of her, he wraps his hands around her neck... kayako seeing toshio, her son, watching through the bars of the second floor railing as... takeo snaps kayako's neck with an audible crack... kayako, not dead, but paralyzed, watching as... takeo drowns a flailing toshio in the bathroom tub... takeo tears apart toshio's cat, still alive, in the bathroom sink... kayako letting out a horrible croaking, the only sound her broken neck can emit, as takeo advances on her with a knife, his eyes filled with a manic madness... takeo in the attic, stuffing kayako and toshio, both very dead, wrapped in plastic sheeting, into a corner... kayako suddenly turning her head and grabbing takeo's arm... her lifeless eyes focusing on takeo's as she croaks... takeo's eyes go wide with fear... and toshio suddenly reaches from his plastic grave, grabbing takeo's other arm...}
