<A>__{the tusken raider approaches two large banthas standing tied to a rock. the monstrous, bear like creatures are as large as elephants, with huge red eyes, tremendous looped horns, and long, furry, dinosaur like tails. the tusken raiders mount saddles strapped to the huge creatures' shaggy backs and ride off down the rugged bluff.}

<A>__{the speeder is parked on the floor of a massive canyon. luke, with his long laser rifle slung over his shoulder, stands before little artoo.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?}
<A>__{the little droid whistles a feeble reply, as threepio poses menacingly behind the little runaway.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{master luke here is your rightful owner. we'll have no more of this obi wan kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me about your mission, either. you're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.}

<D>__{well, come on. it's getting late. i only hope we can get back before uncle owen really blows up.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{if you don't mind my saying so, sir, i think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no, he's not going to try anything.}
<A>__{suddenly the little robot jumps to life with a mass of frantic whistles and screams.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what's wrong with him now?}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.}
<A>__{luke swings his rifle into position and looks to the south.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{sandpeople! or worst! come on, let's have a look. come on.}
