<A>__{a french dst security man comes out of the apartment building first. he looks around the street and then nods. a second dst man comes out of the building and gets in a black renault after first checking underneath it to make sure there is no bomb and then popping the hood and examining the engine and then examining the ignition wires. satisfied, he takes a deep breath and starts the motor and then the first dst man nods inside the apartment building and another dst man comes out with agnieska next to him. he opens the door for her when two shots ring out, both of them hitting her in the forehead. the dst agents scatter for cover when suddenly the car parked in front of the renault explodes with tremendous force and the dst agents are all hit.}
