<L>__{interior honeymoon suite night}
<A>__{eva sits among pillows before the altar as ted stands in front of her. ted is trying his best to make poor eva smile. but no matter what his antics, she looks off sadly.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{help me out, lady. i gotta earn this fifty bucks!}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{oh look, they don't care if i smile or not! all they want is...}
<A>__{ted waits; she sighs and rest her chin in her hand.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{you won't understand, believe me.}
<A>__{she begins to cry tearfully again.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{try me. i've been around, y'know.}
<A>__{he postures proudly, all puffed out. eva looks at him helplessly. and he paternally encourages her to explain.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{well... okay. the five of us elspeth, jezebel, athena, raven and me are a coven.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{ha, like a coven of witches?}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{he looks around the room: quick cuts of candles, iconography, jars of lurid substances, unknown body parts of animals woven into the nature sculpture... and are those tongues in that can? ted's getting the creeps, but again puffs himself up.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i knew that!}
<C>__{eva}
<P>__{(getting calmer)}
<D>__{and you see, our coven has spent forty years trying to perfect a ritual to undo a wicked curse put on our goddess diana.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{gee, you don't look a day over twenty!}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{oh... ha ha... i mean the witches before us tried and failed. but athena, our high priestess, discovered a great potion to reverse the evil spell which turned our beautiful goddess into an old rock.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(looking at the rock)}
<D>__{yeah? is... is that her?}
<A>__{eva nods, looking lovingly at the stone.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{she was a beautiful virgin. an entertainer by trade, but a great sorceress by design. it was here in this very room, on her wedding night, a jealous rival placed the curse on diana.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{she turned to that here?}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{yes... and her young husband turned into a pink fish! they found him swimming in the pool in circles. while our dear goddess: a stone in her honeymoon bed.}
<A>__{ted frowns as he ponders all this. eva takes a photo from the altar and hands it to ted.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{this was diana.}
<A>__{close on photo: a blond bombshell in full on betty page attire, a bare tittied pinup girl, playfully spanking a girl in bondage with a spiked high heel.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{this girl here? this is the goddess diana?}
<A>__{the photograph slowly comes alive. diana stops spanking the girl and unties her. she pulls the girl (in the black satin mask) up off her lap and makes the girl stand. the women face each other and break into a cheek to cheek tango. close on ted as he shakes his head. are his eyes playing tricks on him?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i hate to tell you this, but i kinda doubt she was a virgin.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{oh, but she was! she had lovers, but she saved that for marriage. which is the example i've tried to follow: to do everything but that till i marry...}
<A>__{she begins to sob again. ted comforts her.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{hey, don't cry... a virgin is a rare and beautiful thing. if you say she was a virgin, i will believe it.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{well, it doesn't matter now... and she won't be resurrected tonight 'cause i failed her. i let my whole coven down!}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{wait a sec that rock was gonna turn back into this?}
<A>__{he holds up the photo. eva nods.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{now, that would be something worth seeing!}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{only, not now we were each supposed to bring something a life fluid.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(wincing in disgust)}
<D>__{if this is gonna be like one of those afterbirth conversations, i don't think i wanna hear this.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{only... i swallowed it...}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you swallowed what?}
<A>__{eva looks off. ted searches his brains, thoroughly sickened now.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you mean, you were supposed to bring... like... like a guy's... and you...?}
<A>__{she nods; he winces, queasy. eva looks at him, helpless.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{and now, you're my last chance!}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{yeah, sure.}
<P>__{(then panic)}
<D>__{whoa, what? you want my for the witchy poo ahh no no way nope. besides, it's against hotel policy. i was warned: "no sex with the clientele"!}
<A>__{eva sobs, pleading. she throws off her shawl, baring her lovely breasts, and reaches her arms around his neck. he keeps backing off. unbeknownst to him, he is already doing a ritualistic shuffle.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{ha, c'mon now, joke's over.}
<P>__{(seeing this is no joke)}
<D>__{hey, we're gonna step in the flea powder.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{that's not flea powder, that's sacred dust ground from the horns of albino goats.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{right! i knew that!}
<A>__{he is backing away, into the circle, as she comes for him, soft and sweet. her eyes are again putting the magic hex on him, as he tries to resist her gaze.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{what's a nice girl like you doing in a coven, anyway?}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{well, see, what i really want to do is be a midwife. i've attended four births already! i can prevent vaginal tears and everything.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(trying to dodge her hexing eyes)}
<D>__{well, that's a good thing! a guy doesn't like surprises down there.}
<A>__{all the while she is stepping toward him into the circle.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{i joined the coven to attain greater understanding of my feminine power so i could become a truly great midwife!}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(the hex working now)}
<D>__{oh, well, i see you've been gaining a lot of insight into your... girl powers...}
<A>__{eva sweetly takes his hand and places it on her breast.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{do you really think so?}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(buckling under the temptation)}
<D>__{well, yeah, i'd say that seems to be the case...}
<P>__{(she licks his neck;}
<D>__{his eyes roll back}
<P>__{heavenly)}
<D>__{ohhh, god! betty's gonna kill me!}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{who's betty your girlfriend?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{no. my boss.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{oh good!}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{oh no!}
<A>__{they fall into a kiss, as she begins to remove his cap. she moves him toward the jacuzzi, closer and closer.}
