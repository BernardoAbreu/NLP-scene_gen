<L>__{interior chhatrapati shivaji terminus. day.}
<A>__{the commuters have mostly gone. jamal is pacing the platform desperately. he stops, stares blankly at the statue in front of him a proud, rather pompous figure in a victorian frock coat. the plaque reads: frederick stevens.}
<L>__{interior inspector's office. night.}
<A>__{the inspector, srinivas and jamal are staring at the video recorder.}

<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{and did she come back?}
<A>__{jamal smiles sadly.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{i wouldn't be here if she had.}

<C>__{inspector }
<D>__{guess not.}
<A>__{right in the eyes.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{the most beautiful woman in the world.}
<A>__{constable srinivas snorts. suddenly, jamal is out of his chair and at srinivas' throat. the combined force of the inspector and srinivas force him roughly back down. he is again handcuffed to the chair.}
<C>__{inspector of police}
<D>__{well, well. the slum dog barks. money or women. the reason for most mistakes in life. looks like you got mixed up with both. srinivas, you need the exercise: a trip to vt station to check on the statue. and lock your bloody bike up.}
<A>__{constable srinivas swears under his breath but bumbles out.}
