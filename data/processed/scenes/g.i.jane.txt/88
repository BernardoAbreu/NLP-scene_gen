<D>__{i don't know if there's any single reason. but my father was navy. and he had this old time recruiting poster in his den. it showed a girl trying on a sailor's uniform while saying, "gee, i wish i were a man! i'd join the navy!" was maybe 10 years old when i first saw it, and even then it felt wrong. made me mad. and i don't think a month has gone by that i haven't thought about that poster. "gee, i wish i were a man."}

<D>__{i've been accused of that wish.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{the woman i saw you with...}
<C>__{blondell}
<D>__{just a friend. we have friends, too, you know.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{but are there... i mean, how many...}
<C>__{blondell}
<D>__{more than you'd guess. it's just that we don't hold coffee klatches. if more then three of us get together at any one time, the guys think it's some kind of uprising.}
<A>__{they laugh.}
<C>__{blondell}
<D>__{sounds funny now, but it's really not. we have to be careful. the navy still knows how to put on a witch hunt.}
<A>__{reaching the quarterdeck, they scan a message board. jordan finds a half dozen phone slips for her.}
