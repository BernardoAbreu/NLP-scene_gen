<L>__{exterior larry osterberg's home. day}
<A>__{phil arrives on his trike outside a small house.}
<L>__{interior larry osterberg's home. day}
<A>__{a man is sitting cross legged on the floor. a joss stick burns beside him, and sitar music plays in the background. this is larry osterberg, and he is meditating. there is a loud hammering on the door. larry shows no sign of having heard anything. more hammering at the door, but still no response. then the letter box creaks open and an eye appears in the slot. after a moment, the eye disappears and phil's face appears momentarily at the window. the window seems to be slightly higher than phil, so his face appears every time he jumps up to peer into the room.}
<C>__{phil}
<P>__{(o.s)}
<D>__{hello? anyone there?}
<A>__{then phil is gone. larry expels a big breath. the letterbox creaks opens again and the eye is back.}
<C>__{phil }
<P>__{(o.s)}
<D>__{there you are. i'm looking for larry osterberg.}
<A>__{larry sighs, and stretches. he gets up slowly, gently shakes himself to relax his muscles and walks to the door, which he opens.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{the door is unlocked.}
<A>__{phil barrels in and closes the door behind him. he turns to take a look around the room.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{you larry osterberg?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{yes. welcome to my house.}
<A>__{this might be sarcastic, but any nuance is lost on phil, who props the guitar up against the wall.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{very nice. what's that noise?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{manomanjari on the sitar by nikhil banerjee.}
<P>__{(nb. similar music may be used in this scene)}
<D>__{phil stares at him.}
