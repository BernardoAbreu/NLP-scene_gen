<C>__{amy}
<D>__{you're awful kind to yourself, norville barnes the fact is you've slowed down, sitting up here like a sultan, not doing a lick of work! why you know it's ideas that are the lifeblood of industry and you haven't come up with one since the hoop and the reason's plain to see! you've forgotten what made your ideas exciting for you in the first place it wasn't for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of would you get out of here?!}
