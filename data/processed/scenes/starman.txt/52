<L>__{exterior jenny's house dawnbreak}
<A>__{the mustang is backing out of the driveway with jenny behind the wheel and the star man perched nervously on the passenger seat.}
<L>__{interior mustang dawnbreak}
<A>__{wary of what will happen next, the star man watches jenny move the gear selector to the drive position. the car jerks forward and he grabs the dashboard to keep from toppling back in the seat. during the ride up the block, his head swivels from side to side trying to take in as much of the darkened urban landscape as he can. when the car stops at a 'stop' sign, he looks at jenny questioningly.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{please...}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{which way do you want to go?}
<A>__{she motions ahead and he turns to look at an inter section with streets running in three directions off of it. his eyes question jenny again.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you can go that way...}
<P>__{(points left)}
<D>__{that way...}
<P>__{(straight ahead)}
<D>__{that way...}
<A>__{she points right. after another look at jenny, the star man presses the palms of his hands together, concentrates briefly, then slowly draws them apart. the force field appears between them. on it the solarized view of the united states rotates until the red destination dot is on his right. he drops his hands and points to the right.}
<C>__{star man}
<P>__{(measured)}
<D>__{that way.}
<A>__{the satel compass continues to hover over the dashboard.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(staring incredulously at the compass)}
<D>__{god, what are you?}
<A>__{she starts her right turn without looking left and fails to see a little mg approaching from that direction. the wail of the air horn startles jenny and reflexively she slams on the brakes. the mustang stalls and the mg squeals around them. jenny checks the star man. he has pressed himself against the passenger door. the gun lies on the seat next to him. they both look at it. the star man recovers and picks it up.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(starting the engine)}
<D>__{i'm sorry...}
<A>__{this time when jenny puts the car into drive, the star man is ready for the acceleration. the car completes the turn and the compass rotates to its new heading. looking at it from this angle, jenny suddenly recognizes it for what it is: an aerial view of the united states.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{that green dot, that's us, isn't it... and the red's where you want to go?... you don't understand me, do you?}
<A>__{the star man looks at her uncomprehendingly.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{i gotta get out of here.}
