<A>__{sid is standing on the counter masking the top sill of the kitchen window. there's half a donut hanging from his mouth. beth comes through the swinging door.}

<D>__{you've lived here your whole life?}
<A>__{the half donut falls from the startled sid's mouth.}

<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(increduously)}
<D>__{you've never gone anywhere?}
<A>__{he picks up the half donut.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{travelling has no allure for me.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{none?}
<A>__{sid climbs down and sits on the counter, dropping the half donut back into the donut box.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{maybe through time.}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{that's not offered.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{so i stay here.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{sid}
<P>__{(the simple truth)}
<D>__{it's my home. i belong here.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i'm serious.}

<D>__{my father says if you stay in one place long enough your luck knows where to find you.}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(wryly)}
<D>__{maybe that's my problem.}

<D>__{he's lived here his whole life.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{has his luck found him?}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{not yet.}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{but it's probably very close.}
<A>__{beth smiles weakly. abruptly, she drops her donut back in the box.}
<C>__{sid}
<P>__{(cautiously)}
<D>__{are you all right?}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(apologetically)}
