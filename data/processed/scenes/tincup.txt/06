<L>__{exterior driving range night}
<A>__{the lesson begins. tin cup can be slightly condescending in these situations, though she's got him a little wary.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{the first thing you gotta learn about this game, doc, is it ain't about hitting a little white ball into some yonder hole. it's about inner demons and self doubt and human frailty and overcoming all that crap. so... what kinda doctor'd you say you were?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i'm a psychologist in layman's terms call me a neo jungian, post modern freudian, holistic secularist.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{damn.}
<A>__{she begins unpacking one of her bags, pulling out every golf gimmick on the market swing aid straps to pull your elbows together, a ball pendulum that hangs from your hat, a metal contraption for your feet, etc.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{inner demons and human frailty are my life's work. i used to practice in el paso but i've moved here now...}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{what're those?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i ordered these from the golf channel.}
<A>__{he stares in disbelief as she tries to wriggle into some of this stuff. he's enchanted and dismayed.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{that stuff's a waste of money.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i'm sure there are excesses and repetitions here, but i believe in the gathering of knowledge and i figured, well, there must be some truths about the golf swing illustrated by these devices and that you'd help me sort through it.}
<A>__{she stands there with contraptions coming from every limb.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i have dozens of golf videotapes, too... and a golf watch.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<P>__{(irritated, impatient)}
<D>__{take it off. all of it. now! you're a smart woman, for chrissakes don't you know the work of charlatans when you see it?}
<A>__{she deposits all the golf gimmick devices in a pile.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{no. i can always tell when someone is lying to himself, but i'm quite susceptible and frequently wrong when that person lies to me.}
<P>__{(pointing to the pile of devices)}
<D>__{that stuff cost me over 200 dollars }
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{then it's 200 dollars of shit...}
<A>__{he tees a ball, hands molly her driver and steps back.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{go ahead. take a swing.}
<A>__{molly takes a pitty pat swing and whiffs, and mutters under her breath with the ease of a longshoreman.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{aw, fuck...}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{well, you talk like a golfer }
<A>__{molly unloads a mighty second swing. the club head bounces off the mat. the ball sits untouched.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{shit.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{'fuck...' 'shit...' these are highly technical golf terms and you're using them on your first lesson this is promising.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{awright, wise ass, show me.}
<A>__{tin cup takes the club from molly, motions for her to step back, tees up a ball, and rockets a drive into the night.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{something like that.}
<A>__{he hands her back the club and tees up another ball. molly just looks at him.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{impressive. y'know, i tend to process things verbally. can you break down into words how you did that?}
<A>__{tin cup takes a deep breath this is his speech.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{'what is the golf swing?' by roy mcavoy.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the golf swing is a poem.}
<C>__{tin cup }
<D>__{sometimes a love sonnet and sometimes a homerian epic it is organic and of a piece, yet it breaks down into elegant stanzas and quatrains. the critical opening phrase of this song is the grip, in which the hands unite to form a single unit by the simple overlap of the smallest finger...}
<P>__{(displays grip)}
<D>__{... held lightly, a conductor's baton.}
<P>__{(starts swing)}
<D>__{lowly and slowly the clubhead is pulled back, led into position not by the hands but the body which turns away from the target, shifting to the right side without shifting balance. tempo is everything, perfection unobtainable, as the body coils, now to the top of the swing, in profound equilibrium. and then a slight hesitation, a nod to the gods...}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{a nod to the gods?}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{to the gods, yes... that he is fallible. as the weight shifts back to the left pulled now by powers inside the earth it's alive, this swing, a living sculpture and down through contact, always down, into terra firma, striking the ball crisply with character a tuning fork goes off in your heart, your balls such a pure feeling is the well struck golf shot and then the follow through to finish, always on line the reverse 'c' of the golden bear, the steelworker's power and brawn of carl sandburg's arnold palmer, the da vinci of hogan, the unfinished symphony of roy mcavoy.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{what? what's unfinished?}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{i have a short follow through my swing can look unfinished.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{some say it's because that's the best way to play through the winds of west texas... and some say it's because i never finish anything. you can decide. the point is every finishing position is unique as if that is the signature left to the artist, the warrior athlete who, finally and thereby, has asserted his oneness with and power over the universe by willing a golf ball to go where he wants and how and when, because that is what the golf swing is about...}
<P>__{(finally)}
<D>__{it is about gaining control of your life, and letting go at the same time.}
<A>__{molly stares back, exhausted and intrigued.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{jeez louise...}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{there is only one other acceptable theory of how to hit a golf ball.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i'm afraid to ask. what's the other theory?}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{grip it and rip it.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{while i appreciate your poetic sensibility, mr. mcavoy }
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{call me roy, molly...}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{call me dr. griswold...}
<C>__{molly }
<D>__{roy... but at this point i think i'm more of the 'grip it and rip it' school. hand me the driver.}
<A>__{tin cup does. she tees it up.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{waggle it, doc, don't forget to waggle.}
<P>__{(as she stares at him)}
<D>__{waggle... the club head...}
<P>__{(shows her)}
<D>__{... it's a little relaxing ritual...}
<A>__{she waggles the club head, then takes the club back.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{let the big dog eat!}
<A>__{she stops, lets the club fall.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{what big dog?}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{the driver, the number one wood }
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{it's metal.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{yeah, woods are metal don't worry about it and the driver's known as the big dog and i'm just saying to turn him loose, let 'er rip, let the big dog eat!}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{she swings. tops the ball. it goes ten feet.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{this is, without a doubt, the stupidest, silliest, most idiotic grotesquery masquerading as a game that has ever been invented.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<P>__{(cheerfully)}
<D>__{yes, ma'am, that's why i love it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and if you hit one good shot if that tuning fork rings in your loin you can't wait to get back.}
<A>__{she cracks one dead solid perfect out into the night. it felt great and she knows it.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i think the big dog ate something.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{did the tuning fork ring in your loin?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i wouldn't go that far.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{always quit on a good shot. we'll call that lesson number one...}
<P>__{(confidentially)}
<D>__{... and if ya wouldn't mind paying me in cash there's a little i.r.s. situation i'm dealing with }
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{if you're such a legendary striker of the golf ball as everyone says, then why are you, at your age, out here in the middle of nowhere operating a barely solvent establishment, ducking the i.r.s., collecting a few pathetic dollars to buy your next sixpack when you're capable of so much more?}
<A>__{her speech is delivered without judgement or rancor, so matter of factly that he's disarmed.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{perhaps i'm chocked full of inner demons?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{no, you're chocked full of bullshit }
<P>__{(cheerily)}
<D>__{same time next week?}
<A>__{she heads off to the parking lot. he stares.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{what did you mean i should try 'being saddled' sometime?}
<C>__{tin cup }
<D>__{were you being literal or was that some kind of freudian type deal? molly? doctor?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what kind of saddle?}
<B>__{close on molly}
<A>__{as she walks into the west texas night. she smiles, enjoying tin cup's confusion. tin cup just stares into the night, holding his cash, until jose's voice echoes down from the roof.}
<C>__{jose}
<D>__{i got it! esta bien! the flag is up!}
