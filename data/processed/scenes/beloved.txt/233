<L>__{interior ella's house day.}
<A>__{ella has gathered all the women of the town for a meeting including lady jones, janey wagon, m. lucille williams, grace;}
<C>__{grace}

<C>__{janey}
<D>__{that what she say.}
<C>__{m. lucille}
<C>__{williams}
<D>__{how they know it's her?}
<C>__{ella}
<D>__{it's sitting there. sleeps, eats and raises hell. whipping sethe every day.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i will be. a baby?}
<C>__{janey}
<D>__{no. grown now. the age it would have been had it lived.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{in the flesh. and whipping her.}
<C>__{m. lucille}
<C>__{williams}
<D>__{guess she had it coming a little.}
<C>__{ella}
<D>__{nobody got that coming.}
<C>__{m. lucille}
<C>__{williams}
<D>__{but ella you can't just up and kill your children.}
<C>__{ella}
<D>__{no, and the children can't just up and kill the mama. what's fair ain't necessarily right...}
<P>__{(the women listen)}
<D>__{now you all know how i felt about the whole thing. i know the rage sethe felt in that shed that day. we all do. but what i could not understand, and still don't, was her reaction to it. prideful. too damn complicated for a black woman in her position before god. but whatever she done, i don't like the idea of past errors taking possession of the present. i don't cotton to sin moving in on a house, unleashed and sassy. every day life takes enough, takes all a woman has. "sufficient unto the day is evil thereof" and nobody needs more. nobody needs a grown up evil sitting at a table with a grudge. as long as that ghost showed itself from a ghostly place, i respected it. but once it take on flesh and come into this world, well, the shoe's on the other foot now. i don't mind a little communication between worlds. but this here's an invasion.}
<A>__{the women agree.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{should we pray?}
<C>__{ella}
<D>__{uh huh. first. then we got to get down to business.}
