<A>__{travis stacks five crisp hundred dollar bills beside the letter, folds them up with the letter, and puts them into an envelope. timecut: a short while later. travis has cleaned up his apartment. everything is neat and orderly. camera pans across room. the mattress is bare and flattened out, the floor is spotless, the cans and bottles of food and pills put out of sight. the wall is still covered with palantine political paraphernalia, but when we reach the desk we see only four items there: an open diary and three loaded revolvers: .44, .38, .25. travis, freshly shaved and neatly dressed, stands in the middle of his clean room. the empty holster hangs on his shoulder. metal .25 gliders can be seen under the slit in his right sleeve. he turns toward table.}
