<A>__{jane is on her knees by a strange overhanging rock. the night sky is awesome; the universe is all around her. she is trying to calm herself with a prayer.}
<L>__{exterior day. the moor.}
<A>__{jane lies on a great rock, soaking up the heat of the sun. she is like someone numb with pain. she watches a lizard crawl over the rock. she is mesmerised.}
<L>__{exterior twilight. the moor.}
<A>__{jane squats in the heather and eats bilberries as the light fades. she hungrily licks the juice from her hand.}
<L>__{exterior dawn. the moor.}
<A>__{jane is asleep in the heather, her shawl wrapped around her. a red haired child in a white nightgown lies by her side, watching her. it is helen burns. helen reaches out. she touches jane's hand. jane wakes. she sits up. she is alone.}
