<L>__{interior orlean's apartment evening}
<A>__{orlean looks at a book called the native orchids of florida. she comes to a photo of the ghost orchid glowing white on the page. orlean's husband walks by with a cup of coffee, caresses her shoulder. she tenses slightly, smiles up at him apologetically. he smiles back sadly. she returns to the photo. a line of text catches her eye: "should one be lucky enough to see a flower all else will seem eclipsed." orlean closes the book, sits there. she dials the phone.}

<C>__{laroche }
<D>__{i'd love to, but, hey, i'm banned for the next six months. goddamn crucified me. get one of them monkey suited rangers to take you. 'course, they wouldn't be able to locate a ghost, if it climbed off a tree and shoved itself up their ass. hey, put that in the article.}
