<L>__{interior supermarket day}
<A>__{theme music continues as a grinning, deranged pitchman the joker pushes his shopping cart down the aisle. the shelves are filled with products bearing his trademark harlequin's face. he waves merrily in time to the music.}
<L>__{interior studio video control booth that moment}

<P>__{(a sweep of the hand)}
<D>__{let's go to our blind taste test.}
<A>__{tight on an anonymous man gagged and blindfolded, tied to his chair, squirming, struggling. on the table before him is a package labelled "brand x." a superimposed title reads: "not an actor."}
<C>__{joker }
<D>__{ooh. he's tense. irritable. out of sorts.}
<P>__{(wagging a finger)}
<D>__{he's been using brand x! but with new improved joker brand...}
<A>__{angle widens to include a blindfolded corpse, limp in his chair, grinning horrifically.}
<C>__{joker }
<D>__{... it's a smile every time!!}
