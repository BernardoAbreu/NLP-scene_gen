<L>__{interior bar later}
<A>__{tinny music plays. the place is almost empty. in the back of the bar the three sit in a corner drinking beer just young people, laughing, a little drunk. they could be students. rachel is reciting something from memory.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{uh, at ten study the mishnah, at fifteen study the talmud. by eighteen stand under the wedding canopy...}
<C>__{stephan}
<D>__{we're too late for all of those.}
<A>__{they laugh.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{uh...twenty. in your twenties you are to "pursue your life's goals."}
<C>__{stephan}
<P>__{(flirtatious)}
<D>__{what are you pursuing rachel?}
<A>__{rachel thinks about it, shrugs.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i don't know. i'm waiting to find out.}
<C>__{stephan}
<P>__{(smiles to himself)}
<D>__{youth...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{what about you, grandfather? have you got a goal?}
<C>__{stephan}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{oh yes. we believe in goals in my family. we're very driven men. my father was director of collections by the time he was fifty.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{so what's your goal?}
<C>__{stephan}
<D>__{director of collections by forty.}
<A>__{they laugh.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(to david)}
<D>__{what about you david. what "life goal" are you pursuing?}
<A>__{david smiles, stares at his drink.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{this is it.}
<A>__{rachel laughs, looks around at their less than glamorous surroundings.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{this is it? this is all you want?}
<A>__{david laughs. he would obviously rather change the subject but rachel is a little drunk, a little curious.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{seriously, what do you want out of life?}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(beat, shrugs)}
<D>__{i want this. i want to get vogel. i want him to be put on trial and i want the world to watch so everyone knows what he did. i want them all to know the truth.}
<A>__{he looks up at their faces, embarrassed at having darkened the atmosphere.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{and...i want another drink.}
<A>__{he gets up and walks off to the bar. rachel stares after him. stephan watches her.}
<C>__{stephan}
<D>__{forget about it.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{forget about what?}
<C>__{stephan}
<D>__{i've spent two years with him, and i don't know him. nobody knows him. he's alone.}
<A>__{rachel thinks this over.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{what about family?}
<A>__{stephan stares at her. she realises what this means.}
<C>__{rachel }
<D>__{all of them?}
<C>__{stephan }
<D>__{all of them.}
<A>__{he looks over at david standing at the bar.}
<C>__{stephan }
<D>__{maybe it's not always a blessing to survive.}
