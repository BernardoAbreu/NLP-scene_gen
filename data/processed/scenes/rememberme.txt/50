<L>__{exterior railroad flat rooftop day}
<A>__{sunshine beats down on a little make shift rooftop hideaway, a few old beach chairs, a stereo, a weight bench. aidan works out with an old set of dumb bells. tyler sits on a beach chair, trying again with the guitar.}
<C>__{aidan}
<D>__{...so? she just left? no good bye?}
<A>__{tyler nods, strumming like he's wearing boxing gloves. aidan finishes up a set.}
<C>__{aidan}
<D>__{maybe she heard you play the guitar.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{you were the one dumping jello shots down her throat. you almost killed her.}
<A>__{aidan lies down to do the bench press... there's a lot of weight on the bar.}
<C>__{aidan}
<D>__{there are sins of omission and sins of commission, my friend. i've dealt with mine and i've forgiven myself... you should do the same.}
<A>__{aidan lifts. it's too heavy and falls to his chest. tyler forgoes his spotting duty, lets him struggle. aidan strains.}
<C>__{aidan}
<D>__{...little help, t... little help, little help, lotta help... tyler?!}
<A>__{tyler blows three perfect smoke rings. finally he puts down the guitar and helps get the bar up. aidan panting, rubbing his chest.}
<C>__{aidan}
<D>__{what the hell was that?}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{penance. i have to get to work.}
