<L>__{interior basement}
<A>__{the music is off now. bobby comes down, burt follows. joseph is getting something whispered in his ear by another cop. a squat man with a bad toupee starts to speak: nypd deputy commissioner spiro giavannis.}
<C>__{spiro giavannis}
<D>__{everyone? everyone!}
<A>__{rosario is leaning up against a post, drinking, watching the party. she stares down a guy who ogles her lasciviously. with a sense of humor, she winks at him:}
<C>__{rosario diaz}
<D>__{you take a picture, it'll last longer.}
<A>__{bobby approaches rosario, grabs her hand:}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{c'mon, let's get outta here, [we'll] go party with jumbo.}
<A>__{he tugs her away. she stops him. with assurance:}
<C>__{rosario diaz}
<D>__{we could stay if you want, baby. they don't like me, i don't care you're better than them anyway }
<C>__{bobby green}
<P>__{(waves her off)}
<D>__{we're goin'. c'mon.}
<A>__{she hurriedly puts down her drink. joe stands near spiro, but his attention is on his brother:}
<C>__{spiro giavannis}
<D>__{i'm deputy commissioner spiro giavannis }
<A>__{applause. bobby, rosario move to the exit. simultaneous:}
<C>__{spiro giavannis }
<D>__{you know, we look around in these troubled times, and in moments like this we need leaders, men and women who can bring order back to our great communities. we're here this holiday season to give thanks for one of these men, our russian brother, joseph grusinsky.}
<A>__{cheers. joseph smiles, waves. filled with hubris.}
<C>__{spiro giavannis }
<D>__{...joseph, many of us've known your father, deputy chief burt grusinsky, for many years, and i know he wants to say a little something. chief?}
<A>__{applause for burt, who waves, steps up:}
<C>__{burt grusinsky}
<D>__{thank you. you know, i used to tell my kids, "work first, play later," and my son joseph really took it to heart. he's been a real fighter over the years... he overcome his mother's passing, and the dyslexia eventually wound up graduating john jay as salutatorian and distinguished himself many times.}
<P>__{(turns to joseph)}
<D>__{anyway, you've shown yourself to be very brave and selfless, and i'm just, i'm very proud here tonight.}
<A>__{big applause as joseph steps forward. bobby and rosario squeeze through the crowd, to the stairs.}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky}
<D>__{thank you everybody for coming happy thanksgiving. before i say anything else... we got some bad news this morning.}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky }
<D>__{one of our irish brothers was killed in the line of duty last night detective edward conlon was gunned down serving a warrant on northern boulevard. the clock's about to strike ten, so i thought we might give a moment of silence to remember.}
<A>__{bobby stops. instinctively, he turns back to the room, motions to rosario to stop. out of respect. she does. then: the church bell rings. ten times. silence. the bell gongs. the camera dollies past: joseph and his family, and jack, and michael, then past rosario, and burt, and bobby. the bell stops. the sea of blue, the police, genuflect. our characters do not. instead, bobby stares at joseph and burt across the crowded room. they return the glare, and bobby exits...}
