<L>__{interior church early morning}
<A>__{connor and murphy are at prayer in the back of the church. it is mostly empty because of the early hour. connor looks up and sees smecker and rocco way up in the front. his eyes are ablaze. he is up and walking and does not bother murphy, who remains penitent. there are two confessional booths with a priest booth in the middle. smecker goes in the booth on the far left. rocco tries the door, it's locked. a middle aged priest slips a key in the priests booth and opens the door. rocco shoves him in and goes in behind him. connor has quickened his pace. he tries both doors. they're locked. he goes into the confessional on the right.}
