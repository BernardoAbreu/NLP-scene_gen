<L>__{exterior okh headquarters day}
<A>__{est. an early morning fog blankets the ground, obscuring our view. eerie.}
<L>__{interior okh headquarters hallway day}
<A>__{footsteps echo through the cavernous hallways. tresckow marches with purpose through the numerous security checkpoints. it is a long, suspenseful walk. he is aware of someone walking up behind him, getting closer. we think he's done for, but a bespectacled, middle aged officer overtakes him and whispers:}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{what happened?}
<A>__{titles: general friedrich olbricht chief of general}
<B>__{army office in berlin.}
<C>__{tresckow}
<D>__{i can only guess the altitude caused the fuse to malfunction. first the beer hall, memorial day now this. someone is watching over that sonofabitch, i swear it.}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{we've been discovered.}
<A>__{tresckow halts and faces olbricht, expressionless.}
<C>__{tresckow}
<D>__{what makes you think }
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{oster's been arrested. the gestapo came for him last night.}
<A>__{tresckow thinks for a beat and resumes walking. olbricht hurries after him.}
<C>__{olbricht }
<D>__{did you hear what i said?}
<C>__{tresckow}
<D>__{the gestapo could have arrested him for anything. find a replacement.}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{there's no one we can trust. not in berlin.}
<C>__{tresckow}
<D>__{then stop looking in berlin.}
<A>__{just then, they approach the final threshold, a sentry guards an office marked:}
<B>__{colonel heinz brandt.}
<A>__{olbricht stops, regarding the door with dread. but tresckow presses on, reaching the door, about to enter when:}
<C>__{sentry}
<D>__{your pistol please.}
<A>__{oh shit. tresckow plays it cool, removing his pistol from its holster and handing it over. and with a nod to olbricht, tresckow squares his shoulders and enters brandt's office.}
