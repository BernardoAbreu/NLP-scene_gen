<L>__{exterior forest trail day fade in:}
<A>__{long shot angled west. the forest is fairly open, yellow pine, lodgepole and fir. to the west can be seen the bald red granite domes of the higher range. o.s. there is the sound of the cavalcade approaching. camera pans around and angles past. toward camera, comes the cavalcade, climbing slowly. far in the distance and down can be seen the waste of desert and the barren hills of nevada. clay, a rifle across his legs, is riding on one side of the wagon. steve rides beside mary, who is driving. the remuda trails behind. helen, lying in the wagon bed, cannot be seen.}
<B>__{med. trucking shot}
<A>__{angled past steve. steve has a copy of leslie's weekly open on the pommel. helen lies full length in the wagon bed, occupying herself by giving herself a manicure with an orange stick.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{it's a lot tougher than i figured. knowin' my letters is one thing. but makin' sense out of words is harder'n trackin' weasel after rain.}
<A>__{clay glances over at his brother. mary sees him watching. their eyes meet. she smiles. he doesn't return the smile.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{ and even if i do learn to read, what use'll it be? i'm goin' to live on a ranch!}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{there's plenty of use for reading you'll see.}
<A>__{he sighs and scowls down at the page. he puts his finger on a word and starts to spell it out.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{u n i c o r n ... what in heck's that?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{unicorn a kind of animal }
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{what do they look like?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{hmmm... sort of like a horse with a horn in the center of its forehead.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{horses with horns! huh! do we have 'em in nevada?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{how about california?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{would they be good to eat?}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(not too sure)}
<D>__{kind of tough, i guess... but you're not liable to hunt them i don't think there's any alive now, anyways and i'm not sure but i don't think there ever were...}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?...}
<A>__{mary starts to protest steve goes on.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{an' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough, what's the use of knowin' how to spell them?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you don't read to fill your stomach... poetry, for instance. all the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal but they make you feel good.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(stubbornly)}
<D>__{i feel good anyways.}
<B>__{reverse shot}
<A>__{angled past clay.}
<C>__{clay}
