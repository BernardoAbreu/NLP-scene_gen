<L>__{interior pyramid massive chamber}
<A>__{holloway leads the explorers deeper into the complex. the motors of the cargo rovers whine and growl. david trails the others, eyes raking the blank walls as if he sees something there. he reaches out. passes his hand through the air as if grasping a cobweb. a strange rumbling noise sounds down the corridor, freezing them. holloway sweeps his light that way. the sound comes again: a demonic voice speaking some unearthly language. watts looks at holloway but his eyes are focused on the dark ahead. he moves forward. a beat. the others follow. an apparition appears before them. a pale, luminous giant fifteen feet tall, with hollow eyes and a grotesque snout. it strides toward them. speaks in a sonorous voice. pandemonium. watts backpedals involuntarily. seeing holloway stand his ground, she reaches out to him in a panic.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{martin. martin!}
<A>__{but holloway doesn't budge. stares at the apparition in fascination. everyone else scatters except david, who stands stock still by the wall. watts watches as the apparition walks right up to holloway. disappears with a sizzle of static as holloway experiences the creature passing through him. silence. watts returns to holloway's side. stillwell and downs are huddled on the deck. milburn and fifield have fallen back down the passageway.}
<C>__{fifield}
<D>__{christ. christ!}
<C>__{ravel}
<D>__{it wasn't real.}
<C>__{milburn}
<D>__{we all saw it.}
<A>__{unseen by the others, david reaches out and repeats his gesture in the air. a rumbling sound down the corridor, as before. moments later, the apparition appears round the corner again. they stand their ground: the ghostly giant strides toward them, exactly as before, and disappears with a crackle.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{recording?}
<C>__{fifield}
<D>__{no more. i'm out.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{fifield. get a grip.}
<C>__{fifield}
<D>__{i'm a prospector. you find a load of bauxite, i'm your man. but not this.}
<C>__{milburn}
<D>__{i should go with him. buddy system.}
<C>__{holloway}
<P>__{(disgusted)}
<D>__{fine.}
<A>__{he hauls a heavy rolling case out of the cargo rover.}
<C>__{holloway }
<D>__{you can deploy the drones. drop them in the first or second nexus on your way back.}
<C>__{fifield}
<D>__{give us a rover.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{and half our gear? it's no more than a mile. you can walk it.}
<A>__{sulking, milburn takes the rolling case. the remaining explorers watch fifield and milburn backtrack into the dark.}
<B>__{core chamber door}
<A>__{holloway and watts lead their party up to a massive door, sealed tight. in design and scale, undeniably important. holloway glances at his map.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{this should lead to the core of the pyramid.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{jack it open? or cut through?}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{let's do as little damage as we can.}
<A>__{ravel waves a sensor over the wall.}
<C>__{ravel}
<D>__{there's power. current flowing in the wall.}
<A>__{chance begins to inspect the frame of the door.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{maybe we can hack it. has to be a mechanism...}
<A>__{david looks as if they fail to see something obvious. he points at a spot on the wall beside the massive slab.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{pull up a rover. i want to get up there.}
