<L>__{exterior. the ceremony later}
<A>__{the fire blazes across the face of a shaman. old, gnarled, and dry as the salt flats. with a sacred mutter, he slips a peyote button onto his tongue. then flings back his head, casting his eyes to the stars. when he lowers his head again, we see his pupils dilating. he rises, chanting, moving in ceremonial steps around the fire. tribespeople s i t in a ring, joining the chant. beyond the ring, others are dining at a roasting pit. roast rabbit. cornflour bread. the food is as it might been two thousand years ago. only the sight of plastic water gallons breaks the illusion. lincoln stands apart with grey dove, eating ravenously, gulping from a water gallon. he looks around }

<D>__{what is this place?}
<C>__{grey dove}
<D>__{it is a sacred place. my people come here to commune with their spirits.}
<A>__{lincoln looks at him, puzzled. grey dove smiles tolerantly.}
<C>__{grey dove}
<D>__{not easy to understand perhaps. for us, the spirit is like the shadow on the rock. sometimes close, sometimes far away, sometimes the sky clouds and the shadow fades. we come here to ask our spirits to return to us. the man...}
<P>__{(gestures to the shaman)}
<D>__{he speaks to the grandfather from whom all spirits are born. the great spirit who binds every living thing. he has no name. but he is everywhere. in the sun and the moon, the wind and the rain...}
<A>__{the shaman's chanting grows louder, more insistent. his circuit around the fire becoming faster, building in religious fervor.}
<C>__{grey dove}
<D>__{now he asks for the gift of vision that he may see through to the spirit shape of things. to find the spirits of the lost. to bring them into the light...}
<A>__{the shaman's chanting suddenly stops. he is looking directly at lincoln, pointing. his face, contorting with what might be anger or fear. he starts babbling in dialect, ardently. lincoln frowns in confusion. grey dove quietly draws him away from the mound.}
