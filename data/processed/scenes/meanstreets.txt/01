<A>__{charlie has been dreaming. the dream frightened him. a title appears on the bottom of the frame: charlie. he gets up to look at his face in the mirror. his room is lit by moonlight. it is a small tenement bedroom with a fire escape outside. he returns to bed and as his head hits the pillow, we hear the ronettes singing "be my baby."}
