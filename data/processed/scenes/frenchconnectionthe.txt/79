<L>__{exterior mutchie's bar day}
<A>__{close of doyle going to his car. he stops for a light. doyle is red eyed and in need of a shave. he fidgets through his pockets looking for a cigarette but doesn't find one. as he drives along a girl cyclist comes into view alongside. our view is doyle's view of her long, lean tapered legs. if he looks further, and doyle always looks further, he will see there is a bra band sweater covering her well formed breasts. the pendulous swing is there as she bends over the handlebars. close front view of doyle looking back to the light, then back to the legs. close outside view, the cyclist, of doyle leaning out the window with his badge in his hand.}
