<A>__{chuck carefully shaves some tinder. puts it under a piece of bamboo split lengthwise with a notch cut across it.}
<L>__{exterior beach later}
<A>__{chuck uses a bamboo stick to try to make friction in the split half of the bamboo. he saws back and forth with all his might, pressing it down in the groove.}

<A>__{chuck gives one last saw with his bamboo and stops, utterly defeated. it's all too much.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{sonofabitch!}
<A>__{he starts to rub again. he breathes hard, sweat pours off his face. he is really going for it, what the hell! a tiny wisp of smoke appears! chuck saws with even more energy.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{come on. come on.}
<A>__{the smoke increases. chuck rips away the bamboo, grabs the nest of shavings, and blows on it frantically. the smoke flickers and dies. chuck can't believe it.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{no. no. no.}
