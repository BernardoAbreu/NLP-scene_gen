<A>__{al ghazi keeps moving up and into what is definitely on fleury's top ten list of the most bizarre places he's ever been. fleury's pov: two rooms: first is some kind of snack smoke tv lounge. filipinos serve drinks. packs of young saudi men drink cokes, tea, coffee, and smoke. odd saudi talk shows mix with hip hop. behind, another room: bigger, overflowing with stacks of mis matched computers. dozens of them. dozens of saudi teenagers plugged in. head phoned and mic'd. all chain smoking, all fully plugged in to call of duty (an american war game) on line. these kids play with rabid intensity, smoking and screaming and killing. al ghazi moves through the crowd. a small middle aged saudi spots al ghazi. they exchange words. al ghazi waves fleury to follow. fleury does and follows al ghazi through the computer room, into a back office.}
