<L>__{interior bedroom}
<A>__{a large, master bedroom with glass doors that lead out onto a balcony. sid and billy stare at each other for a long moment. awkward.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{so...}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{so...i'm sorry. i've been a selfish shit and i'm sorry.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{no, billy. i'm the one who's been selfish and self absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{you lost your mom...}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{but you're right enough is enough. i can't wallow in the grief process forever and i can't keep lying to myself about who my mom was.}
<A>__{billy bows his head quietly, knowingly.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{i think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way i'm scared i'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? like the bad seed or something...}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{oh sidney...}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{everytime i get close to you i see my mom. i know it doesn't make sense.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{sure it does. it's like jodie foster in silence of the lambs when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{but this is life. this isn't a movie.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{sure it is, sid. it's all a movie. life's one great big movie. only you can't pick your genre.}
<A>__{billy moves to her. they embrace, tenderly.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{i wanna let go. i do...}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{ssshh...everything's gonna be okay. i promise.}
<A>__{sidney takes the initiative, acting on impulse, kissing him long and hard. she breaks away passionately, out of breath.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{why can't i be a meg ryan movie?}
<A>__{billy nibbles her neck.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{sshh..it's okay.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{or even a good porno.}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{she stares at him, her eyes sexually charged.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{you heard me.}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{are you serious?}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(surprising herself)}
<D>__{yeah...i think so.}
<A>__{they smile at each other.}
