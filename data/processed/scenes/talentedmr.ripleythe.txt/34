<L>__{exterior mongibello. late day.}
<A>__{marge and ripley are on a shopping expedition. they walk down the hill towards the grocery shop, next to the bar in the little square. ripley has asked marge how she and dickie met.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{oh i hated new york that park avenue crowd so i fled to paris to work on my book, and i was always going to this cafe with jean jacques, and dickie used to play his saxophone outside and i would see him and he would see me, and he would play my funny valentine. it was only later that i realised he only knows about six songs.}
<A>__{they've arrived at the grocery store. alessandra, the woman who owns the store greets them. silvana, who's her daughter, is also there, and less comfortable. she waits for marge's order.}
<C>__{marge }
<P>__{(to silvana, in italian)}
<D>__{buono sera, silvana. por favore: arance e pane, e del prosciutto.}
<C>__{silvana}
<D>__{e fichi? come sempre?}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{si. come sempre. grazie.}
<A>__{silvana goes inside for the meat and bread. marge frowns.}
<C>__{marge }
<P>__{(back to ripley)}
<D>__{anyway, then one day, we go in, i see dickie, he starts playing my funny valentine, and then all of a sudden he just walks into the cafe, right in front of jean jacques, and grabs me! now i had never spoken to him in my life he said i'm going to italy, tomorrow, and i want you to come with me. so i did.}
<A>__{at the edge of the square there's a bocce area, where men throw metal balls along a track, aiming to get closest to a small cue. dickie is there, playing intensely with fausto and two other guys, one of whom we've seen before with silvana. ripley and marge loop back towards home, taking in the bocce en route. dickie waves. they wave back. marge calls to him.}
<C>__{marge }
<D>__{if you're not at my place by 7.00, tom and i are running off together.}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{okay.}
