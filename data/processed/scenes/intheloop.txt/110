<D>__{sure. look, i will leave you to your thoughts.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i haven't got any thoughts. i'm just staring vacantly into space while a distant voice in the back of my head goes "oh shit" like a car alarm in the middle of the night.}
<A>__{simon eats another minterior sits there noisily sucking it. judy leaves.}
