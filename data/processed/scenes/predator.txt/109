<C>__{ramirez}
<P>__{(interpreting)}
<D>__{she says the same thing... it was the jungle...}
<A>__{ramirez looks up at billy who continues to stare into the jungle, aware, catlike, reacting to every sound, his nerves on edge, as if ready to snap. ramirez rises, moves alongside his friend, dillon watching closely. revised "hunter" 4 17 86}
<C>__{ramirez}
<P>__{(whispering; imploring)}

<C>__{ramirez}
<P>__{(shaken)}
<D>__{bullshit. you ain't afraid of no man.}
<A>__{billy looks deep into his eyes, chilling ramirez to the bone, looking at his with eyes which have seen on an instinctual level what the others have so far only begun to sense.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{there's something out there, waiting for us...it ain't no man.}
<A>__{billy turns away, moving a short distance away, taking up his position. dillon looks after him and then into the blackness of the jungle canopy. dillon speaks to ramirez.}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{he's losing his cool. there's nothing out there but a couple of men that we're going to have to take down.}
<A>__{despite his words, there is an edge of doubt in his voice. schaefer returns. he's overheard this exchange. he's holding the group of dog tags taken from davis' men. he holds them up for dillon to see.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{you still don't get it, do you dillon? he took davis... and now he wants us.}
