<L>__{exterior hospital roof day }
<A>__{close shot thompson. he is tilted back in a chair which seems to be, and is, leaning against a chimney. leland's voice is heard for a few moments before leland is seen.}
<C>__{leland's voice}
<D>__{when you get to my age, young man, you don't miss anything. unless maybe it's a good drink of bourbon. even that doesn't make much difference, if you remember there hasn't been any good bourbon in this country for twenty years.}
<A>__{camera has pulled back, during above speech, revealing that leland, wrapped in a blanket, is in a wheel chair, talking to thompson. they are on the flat roof of a hospital. other people in wheel chairs can be seen in the background, along with a nurse or two. they are all sunning themselves.}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{mr. leland, you were }
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{you don't happen to have a cigar, do you? i've got a young physician must remember to ask to see his license the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one who thinks i'm going to stop smoking... i changed the subject, didn't i? dear, dear! what a disagreeable old man i've become. you want to know what i think of charlie kane? well i suppose he has some private sort of greatness. but he kept it to himself.}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{he never gave himself away he never gave anything away. he just left you a tip. he had a generous mind. i don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions. that was because he had the power to express them, and charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it but he didn't believe in anything except charlie kane. he never had a conviction in his life. i guess he died without one that must have been pretty unpleasant. of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death. but we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something.}
<P>__{(looks sharply at thompson)}
<D>__{you're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{sorry, mr. leland.}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{never mind bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he? well, charlie was a bad newspaper man even then. he entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{maybe you could remember something that }
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{i can remember everything. that's my curse, young man. it's the greatest curse that's ever been inflicted on the human race. memory i was his oldest friend.}
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{as far as i was concerned, he behaved like swine. maybe i wasnt' his friend. if i wasn't, he never had one. maybe i was what nowadays you call a stooge }
