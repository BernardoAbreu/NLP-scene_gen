<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{int: very late night ariane's apartment}
<A>__{lt has been there for some time. they are alone. they've both been drinking and coking. lt is carrying on about the nun. as he speaks about various subjects, his tone changes radically. from contempt and cynicism to profound reverence. from decadence to awe. ariane, too, manages to switch from one attitude to the other.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{have you ever seen a naked nun? i tell you, man, i went to school with the nuns, i've seen hundreds since then and i've never even seen a nun's belly button, you understand? but this nun, let me tell you. what a beautiful lady...}
<P>__{(snaps out of his awe)}
<D>__{and where'd the church get the 50 g in the first place? the fucking church is the biggest scam going. you know what's the real killer? it costs $8,000 per kid for them to go to parochial school. i've got three kids in there already, with two on the way! christ. that fucking reward is my money, man! but that's church policy. the pope is the world's biggest bookie. makes people bet on their own salvation! double or nothing on heaven. you go to hell then go to hell. in the beginning was the word, and the word was bullshit.}
<A>__{ariane can't stop thinking about the rape.}
<C>__{ariane}
<D>__{i can't get over what those guys did to her. i just can't.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{they're alive, aren't they? come on, man! everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 g for the guys who dared to rape her. do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? of course not. or even for your little sister? the virgin? like shit they would.}
<C>__{ariane}
<D>__{susie's not a virgin anymore.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{she's fucking nine years old! jesus christ.}
<A>__{ariane suddenly starts up.}
<C>__{ariane}
<D>__{and the nun's not a virgin anymore, either. will they make her leave the convent?}
<A>__{lt thinks for a moment.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{who knows? who knows what their policy is.}
<P>__{(sudden dreamy reverence)}
<D>__{but i will tell you, man, that nun... she was beautiful. just beautiful... tall... real tall... i've never seen anything like it...}
<A>__{lt snaps out once again, grabs the telephone. he dials lite. he's not in. lt leaves ariane's number on limelite's beeper. hangs up.}
<C>__{lt}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{lite, man... where the fuck are you?}
<A>__{ariane can't get the image of the rape out of her mind.}
<C>__{ariane}
<D>__{it's horrible. they burned her breasts with cigarettes. christ.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{yeah? at least she's alive! i see people get killed every day! worse yet, tortured first and then killed! the nuns got off easy. jeez. cigarette burns. everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. i will show you cigarette burns!}
<A>__{lt stubs out his cigarette on the back of his hand. he does the move with intensity and bravado. ariane responds by calmly doing the same. but she does it entirely impassively, and rubs the cigarette into her flesh longer than lt did. ariane comes over to lt and starts kissing and licking his}
<B>__{chest.}
<C>__{ariane}
<D>__{do you believe in god? do you believe that jesus christ is the son of god?.}
<A>__{lt hesitates. ariane kneels down in front of lt. as if in prayer. she starts giving him head. before he can answer the question, he is saved by the bell. the phone rings. lt picks up immediately. it's lite. as lt speaks to lite, ariane continues to give him head.}
<C>__{lt}
<P>__{(to lite; over the phone)}
<D>__{yeah, i know, i know all about it. enough already about the fucking nuns. yeah. yeah. so just take the bet. don't give me any hassles, man. just put in my bet. 30 g's. yeah. and i got $900 from the cops on oakland. yeah. right. strawberry's gonna knock em dead. of course he is! you know that! yeah. yeah. have faith, man! ok. right.}
<A>__{lt hangs up, thinks ariane won't resurface the god question. ariane does, even as she gives him head. every time she speaks, she pulls away and it frustrates him. this dialectic continues throughout the scene.}
<C>__{ariane}
<D>__{do you believe in god?}
<A>__{lt thinks about it, even as ariane gets him hotter and hotter.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{the church is a fucking racket. i know how they operate. i've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. my aunt lu says i was crying all the way through. yeah, i know their game inside out. now i'm free of it and i'm gonna stay that way.}
<C>__{ariane}
<D>__{i'm not talking about the fucking church. fuck the church. but tell me. do you believe in god?}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{what's to believe?}
<C>__{ariane}
<D>__{that jesus christ was the son of god and he came to die for your sins.}
<A>__{lt can't respond. he's distracted by his own pleasure. ariane does something oc that causes lt sudden pain. lt cries out. snaps to attention. looks at ariane.}
<C>__{ariane}
<D>__{your sins, lieutenant!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and look around you! where do you think all this shit came from?}
<A>__{ariane gives him head again. lt is more excited now than before she hurt him.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{people.}
<C>__{ariane}
<D>__{you believe that man is the be all and end all?}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{ariane}
<D>__{ok. ok. fine. but do you believe in god?}
<A>__{as if in answer. lt begins to recite the act of contrition}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{i believe in god the father almighty, creator of heaven and earth...}
<A>__{this turns on ariane. she stops talking. writhes and grapples him. lt is reaching climax. when describing jesus rising again lt has an orgasm.}
