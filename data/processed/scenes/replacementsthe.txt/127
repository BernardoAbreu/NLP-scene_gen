<D>__{good evening from the big o here in washington d.c. where the mighty dallas cowboys take on the cinderella washington 'scabskins' as they have come to be known. hi, i'm al michaels and we are witnesses to a unique matchup tonight as shane falco and a contingent of strike players go up against the entire regular squad of the dallas cowboys. yes, you heard right: every cowboy has now crossed the picket line, some as late as this afternoon, and they will all play tonight. can a rag tag group of hasbeens and castoffs stand up to what was once called america's team? and what about the strike itself? it has been so ineffective that many predict it will be over before this game ends. stay tuned as boomer and dan join me for strike ball, d.c. style.}
