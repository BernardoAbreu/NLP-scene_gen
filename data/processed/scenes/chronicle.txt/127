<L>__{interior detmer residence andrew's room later}
<A>__{andrew is filming out his window, watching his father leave. his stereo plays david bowie. once his dad's car is gone, andrew sets down the camera on the dresser opposite the mirror, and leaves the room. time passes, and andrew reappears, now dragging a crate. he opens it, and pulls out his father's fireman's uniform. we do short space time cuts as he takes out the jacket, looks at it, and turns it inside out, so that the metallic fireproof inner lining is exposed. "ziggy stardust" comes on andrew's stereo. andrew, wearing the jacket, looks at himself in the mirror, his back to the camera. he reaches down, and picks something up, looking at it, then pulls it over his head. it's a gas mask. he stands there staring at the surreal, hard edged, faceless figure in the mirror. looks right. looks left. adjusts the mask. then turns and whips out his hand; the camera is abruptly yanked across the room.}
