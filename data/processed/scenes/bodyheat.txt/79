<D>__{i don't know why he's so crazy about her. maybe because he never had any of his own. she's a cute little girl, all right, but other than that... i know this, though, her mother has worked plenty hard to keep heather on edmund's mind, always bringing her around, reporting everything she does in school. that roz is a smart one. and you know that anything heather inherits goes straight to roz. heather won't even get a look at it. that's the part i can't stand. that's why it seems so wrong to have half of it go to her.}

<D>__{that's the way it is. there's nothing we can do about it.}

<D>__{are you sure, ned? i've been thinking about it. maybe there is. the will is with his lawyer in miami i know that. what if i could get him to bring it home? he did it once, he'd do it again. if i could swing it, couldn't we rewrite it? change it. then when he dies, i could find the new one. we could just change it a little. every little change would mean a lot to us, end. you're a lawyer. you know how to write it. it wouldn't seem so odd. i could say he brought it home and we talked about it and decided to make some changes up here. and i knew you already }

<D>__{listen to me, matty. nothing strange can happen in his life right now, not one thing out of the ordinary. that's vital, that's the main thing. if anything does, the chances double that we get caught. you and i are walking out there on the edge every second now. one false move and we're gonna fall off. it'll be all over. you've got to remember that all the time.}
<P>__{(he studies her face)}
<D>__{you'll get half of everything and it'll be plenty. no matter what it is, we're gonna be satisfied. we're not gonna get greedy. if we do, we'll get burned. you gotta believe me, baby, the odds that we'll get burned are good enough without looking for trouble.}
<A>__{she studies him with frightened eyes, then nods her agreement and lays her hand in his lap.}

<D>__{you're right, darling. i'm sorry. i know you're right.}
