<L>__{interior andy's bedroom morning woody's pov of the bedroom}
<B>__{from the toy box}
<A>__{all is clear no sign of andy. woody throws open the lid of the toy box.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{finally!}
<A>__{he takes a couple deep breaths of fresh air, then discovers that his hat is missing.}
<C>__{woody}
<P>__{(looking back into the toy box)}
<D>__{hey! who's got my hat?}
<A>__{the rubber shark pops up wearing woody's cowboy hat.}
<C>__{shark}
<D>__{look, i'm woody. howdy, howdy, howdy!}
<C>__{woody}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{ah hah! ah hah hah!}
<P>__{(grabs the hat)}
<D>__{give me that!}
<A>__{woody leaps out of the toy box.}
<C>__{buzz }
<D>__{say there, lizard and stretchy dog. let me show you something. it looks as though i've been accepted into your culture.}
<A>__{woody looks up to see buzz chatting with rex and slinky.}
<C>__{buzz}
<P>__{(continued)}
<D>__{your chief, andy, inscribed his name on me.}
<A>__{buzz puts his foot out so that slinky and rex can see the sole of his boot. the name "andy" is written on it in permanent marker.}
<D>__{slinky & rex wow!}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{with permanent ink, too!}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{well, i must get back to repairing my ship.}
<A>__{buzz walks away. woody looks at his foot "andy" is written on it also but in a much more childish scrawl, and is largely faded.}
<C>__{bo peep }
<D>__{don't let it get to you, woody.}
<A>__{hearing bo, woody puts his foot back down and quickly straightens up.}
<C>__{woody}
<P>__{(nonchalant)}
<D>__{uh, let what? i don't uh, what do you mean? who?}
<C>__{bo peep}
<D>__{i know andy's excited about buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.}
<C>__{mr. potato head}
<P>__{(walking past)}
<D>__{yeah. like the attic. heh, heh...}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{alright! that's it!}
<A>__{woody angrily marches across the room. across the room, buzz's cardboard ship is still up on the abc blocks. buzz lies down on a skateboard and slides under the ship like a mechanic. snake and robot stand by waiting for instructions. buzz's hand reaches out from under the ship.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{unidirectional bonding strip.}
<A>__{robot turns towards snake who stands in readiness by a tape dispenser.}
<C>__{robot}
<D>__{mr. lightyear wants more tape!}
<A>__{snake rips off a piece of tape with his mouth. woody approaches the skateboard, grabs hold of buzz's foot and rolls him out from under the ship.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{listen, lightsnack, you stay away from andy. he's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<P>__{(to robot)}
<D>__{where's that bonding strip?!}
<A>__{buzz rolls himself back under. woody rolls him out again.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{and another thing. stop with this spaceman thing. it's getting on my nerves.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with star command?}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?}
<A>__{buzz stands up, face to face with woody.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{don't even think about it, cowboy!}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{oh, yeah, tough guy?!}
<A>__{woody pushes buzz in the chest, accidentally activating a button that makes the spaceman's helmet open. buzz grabs his neck, gasping for air. he drops to his knees and begins to writhe on the ground, holding his breath. woody is unsure how to react. suddenly, buzz sniffs the air.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{the air isn't toxic.}
<A>__{buzz rises and points an accusing finger at woody.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{how dare you open a spaceman's helmet on an uncharted planet! my eyeballs could've been sucked from their sockets!}
<A>__{buzz closes his helmet.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{you actually think you're the "buzz lightyear?" oh, all this time i thought it was an act!}
<P>__{(to the room)}
<D>__{hey, guys! look! it's the real buzz lightyear!}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{you're mocking me, aren't you?}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{oh, no, no, no...}
<P>__{(pointing behind buzz)}
<D>__{buzz, look! an alien!}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{where?}
<A>__{buzz falls for the trick and turns around. woody kneels over with laughter. sfx: dog barking woody stops short. all the toys look to the bedroom window.}
<C>__{sid }
<D>__{yessss! ah, ha, ha, ha...}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{uh oh.}
<A>__{slinky hides under the bed.}
<C>__{slinky}
<D>__{it's sid!}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{i thought he was at summer camp!}
<C>__{hamm}
<D>__{they must have kicked him out early this year.}
<A>__{the toys rush over to the window.}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{oh, no! not sid!}
<C>__{sid }
<D>__{...incoming!}
<A>__{from out the window, sid phillips, a hyperactive ten year old, and his dog, scud, can be roughly made out jumping around in their backyard. a tiny figure stands isolated in the center of the yard. sid pummels the figure with rocks while scud strains at his leash, barking wildly.}
<C>__{mr. potato head}
<D>__{who is it this time?}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{i can't tell. hey, where's lenny?}
<C>__{lenny }
<D>__{right here, woody.}
<A>__{woody turns to see, lenny, a pair of wind up binoculars, approaching him from the other end of the desk. woody picks lenny up and looks through him to survey the scene.}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{oh, no. i can't bear to watch one of these again!}
<A>__{angle: binocular view of sid's backyard a full size toy soldier is posed in a running stance in the center of the backyard. a huge m 80 is strapped to the doll's back with masking tape.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{oh, no...it's a combat carl.}
<C>__{sid }
<P>__{(plays under the next 5 lines)}
<D>__{just stay where you are, corporal! don't move, carl. you'll blow up. i know you're tired! i know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. do you hear me?}
<A>__{buzz breaks through the crowd.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{nothing that concerns you spacemen. just us toys.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{i'd better take a look anyway.}
<A>__{buzz grabs lenny from woody and looks through him.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?}
<C>__{woody}
<P>__{(redirecting buzz's view)}
<D>__{that's why. sid.}
<A>__{angle: binocular view of the dog, scud}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{sure is a hairy fellah.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{no! no, that's scud, you idiot!}
<A>__{again, woody readjusts buzz's view. angle: binocular view of sid he is sporting a skull t shirt and laughing hideously.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{that is sid!}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{you mean that happy child?}
<C>__{mr. potato head}
<D>__{that ain't no happy child.}
<C>__{rex}
<D>__{he tortures toys just for fun.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{well, then we've got to do something!}
<A>__{buzz steps up onto the window ledge. the toys gasp in shock.}
<C>__{bo peep}
<D>__{what are you doing?!! get down from there!}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{i'm going to go teach that boy a lesson.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{yeah, sure. you go ahead. melt him with your scary laser.}
<A>__{woody presses buzz's laser button. it emits a wimpy electronic beep. buzz quickly pulls his arm away.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{be careful with that, it's extremely dangerous.}
<A>__{while woody and buzz banter, lenny witnesses sid lighting the fuse of the m80.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{he's lighting it! he's lighting it!}
<C>__{sid }
<D>__{no o o o o!!! ca a a a a arl!}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{hit the dirt!}
<A>__{the toys jump away from the window. sfx: explosion dirt clouds and toy shrapnel rain down along the side of andy's house.}
<C>__{sid }
<D>__{yes! he's gone! he's history!}
<A>__{andy's toys peek over the window sill. angle: sid's yard a large black scorch mark is all that remains where combat carl once stood. sid jumps up and down victoriously while scud resumes his barking.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{i could have stopped him.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{buzz, i would love to see you try.}
<P>__{(gesturing to sid's yard)}
<D>__{'course i'd love to see you as a crater.}
<A>__{sid cackles and dances around the crater.}
<C>__{bo peep}
<D>__{the sooner we move the better.}
