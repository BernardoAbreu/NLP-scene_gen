<L>__{interior campbell center laboratory day}
<A>__{as the agent brings the frightened animal into the monitoring area, catherine and valentine share a moment of "connection." slowly, confidently, she approaches the shepherd, kneels, and removes his leash and muzzle. she strokes him and the dog instantly warms up to her.}
<D>__{fbi k 9 agent sure wasn't like that with me.}
<A>__{novak signs a document and the k 9 agent exits.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{you're a good boy, aren't you, valentine?}
<A>__{the dog picks up a scent from the procedure room and moves it, catherine and novak following. in the procedure room, stargher lies face down on a gurney. now taped to the wall near stargher are pictures from the basement his dolls, the hoist, etc. miriam (in surgical mask and gloves) carefully re inserts the metal rings (taken from an fbi evidence bag) into the eight straps of flesh on his back. when he sees this, valentine whimpers and hides. catherine comforts him. miriam finishes her task and removes her mask.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{i hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i think that's the whole pointerior}
<A>__{valentine runs to his "sleeping" master and barks at catherine as if asking for help. she encourages the animal to lick and sniff stargher's face and hands.}
<D>__{henry (o.s.) (cont'd) that's interesting.}
<A>__{in the control room, he scrutinizes the monitor showing the detailed "map" of stargher's brain.}
<C>__{henry }
<D>__{increased neural activity in the frontal lobes. rising dopamine levels in the basal ganglia. ever since the dog walked in.}
<A>__{in the procedure room, catherine readies herself in the "receive" apparatus. as stargher is lifted off the pedestal, the doors hiss shut and valentine curls up on the floor beneath his master. as catherine is lifted, she smiles at the animal, then looks to stargher.}
<C>__{novak}
<P>__{(comforting and coaching her)}
<D>__{remember, julia hickson is priority number one. nothing else matters. find out where she is.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{okay, okay...}
<A>__{lights flicker. catherine's eyes shut. fade to black:}
<B>__{...}
<C>__{henry }
<D>__{uh oh...}
<A>__{lights flicker. we hear an electrical hum rise and fall. catherine opens her eyes and the lights blink on and off in a weird pattern, making it difficult to see clearly.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{don't kid around, henry...}
<A>__{her suspension apparatus descends on the floor.}
<C>__{henry }
<D>__{i'm not. it's a power problem. i need you to go to the circuit breaker and check switches six through twelve.}
<A>__{catherine moves toward the electrical panel.}
<D>__{henry (o.s.) (cont'd) try to stay awake, okay?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{yeah, yeah, yeah. i'm not sleepy.}
<A>__{as she moves toward the panel, everything becomes larger. by the time catherine reaches the circuit breaker, it is the size of a garage door. curiouser and curiouser... she turns around to see the laboratory is empty and dead quiet. and she sees herself catherine as small as a mouse trapped in a giant walled space. at the console, novak, miriam and henry observe the procedure room. and catherine. suspended in the apparatus. motionless...}
