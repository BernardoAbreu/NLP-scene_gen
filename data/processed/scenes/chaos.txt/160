<L>__{exterior dock night}
<A>__{a narrow wooden dock. there's a few small boats, a tug boat and at the end... a seaplane. dekker approaches the tug. each step slow and deliberate. eyes transfixed on the seaplane. as he nears the seaplane... a shadow rises from behind him. from on top of the tug boat! dekker turns just as... york throws a fishing net on top of dekker. as dekker struggles in the net, his gun discharges! york with a pike pole in hand, leaps down, clubbing dekker over the head with the weapon. dekker goes down! dekker's gun slides off the dock, into the water. york charges dekker with the pike pole, ready to stab, when... at the last second... dekker rolls away! the pike pole breaks a wooden plank to pieces, sticks into the ground beneath the water. dekker, still tangled in the net, kicks out york's legs. he falls to the planks. york quickly rebounds. he pounces on dekker, from behind he wraps his arm around dekker's throat, choking him. dekker struggles to breathe. york squeezes harder.}

<A>__{dekker fights, arms flailing. he reaches blindly behind york, grabs a hold of the pike pole. the pole snaps in two! dekker wildly swings at york who dodges easily. york slams dekker into the side of the tug. still choking. dekker, on his last gasp, pushes off the tug! york stumbles backwards, gets his foot caught in the hole! he twists, spinning around, falling down onto... ... the remaining pike spear! the pike punches through his chest... pops out his back! york, blood and life escaping him, his eyes find dekker. then go dead. dekker steps close. holds a cold, remorseless stare at york's body.}
