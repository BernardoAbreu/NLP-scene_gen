<A>__{a slight breeze gently sways the green and purple crop. the chirp of cicada is the only sound. superimpose: 1868 st. tammany parish, louisiana but suddenly the chirping gets louder and louder bzzzzz! until we realize it's not the cicadas, but a swooosh! a lethal, razor sharp disc buzzes up over the horizon, swoops toward the camera and out of frame! the camera spins around to see the disc flying away, chasing a man, thaddeus morton, wearing a strange metallic collar exhausted, horrified, about to die. new angle morton he looks over his shoulder, panting he's been running forever.}

<A>__{morton zig zags through a grove of trees, a desperate attempt to avoid the horrible serrated disc. but the ruse is futile. the disc goes straight through the trees, slicing a path straight as the crow flies. new angle old wagon dilapidated, broken down, weathering away in the field. morton runs around the wagon but the disc buzzes straight through the sideboards! wood shavings spit everywhere! there's no stopping this thing. new angle morton running for his life stops, turns. he turns, incomprehensibly mumbling, pleading for his life, cowering.}
