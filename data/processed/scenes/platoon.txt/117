<L>__{exterior elias' jungle day}
<A>__{elsewhere, elias stands silently, listens to the forest. in the distance the firefight can hardly be heard. his helmet gone, his hair hanging free, he is at his best now alone. he hears it. somebody running through the jungle, about 100 yards, boots on leaves, coming towards him. he begins to move lateral to the sound. his steps unheard, better at this than the enemy. three enemy figures now appear, crouched and moving very fast with light equipment through the mist. elias swerves up in immediate foreground, his back to us, firing. all three figures fall. a quick glimpse of elias, not bothering to stop, moving to his next position.}
