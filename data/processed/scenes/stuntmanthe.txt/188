<L>__{interior police station}
<A>__{as the three enter. the station is old with a high sergeant's desk and wooden benches against the walls. raymond, beyond tears, destroyed, sits among the other refuse of the night: derelicts, stoned kids, etc. on one bench is a sailor, with that adenoidal look that betrays the weakness he tries to hide with his "butch" arrogance. jake, in the doorway of his office, savors the fact that he has finally nailed eli cross. eli captures the setup in a glance...then, instant theater. he strides across the police station to raymond, takes his head in his hands and kisses him smack on the mouth.}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(vehemently)}
<D>__{who's better, booby...him or me?}
<A>__{gabe has come up behind a patrolman, grabs him by the hips and starts humping like a dog in heat. the policeman shrieks in dismay and tries to escape, but gabe trots along as if they were locked.}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{jake! throw some water on him, quick! only way to get 'em apart!}
<A>__{gabe is now distracted by the sight of the sailor, who is agape with growing disbelief. gabe ogles him.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{yummy...look at the seafood! you're a humpy little number.}
<P>__{(then to raymond, stamping his foot)}
<D>__{you nasty boy. you could've died of mercury poisoning.}
<A>__{the sailor leaps to his feet in horror, screaming.}
<C>__{sailor}
<D>__{jesus christ, they're all faggots!}
