<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior studio day}
<A>__{the assistant is leaning over the counter, listening intently. diane stands in front of the counter, receiving the attentions of the make up man. baden's voice is overlaid:}
<C>__{baden}
<D>__{i want some comedy in this scene...}
<B>__{camera pulls back}
<A>__{the unit is busy preparing for a retake. the studio camera (and its crew) are off camera, and we concentrate on baden briefing his artistes. he is clutching a script as if afraid that opening it might be indecent exposure.}
<C>__{baden}
<D>__{instead of taking the first trunk you see, i want you, darling... to ask for a blue trunk and when he brings it to you, to ask for a red one and when he brings that, to ask for a white one...}
<P>__{(turns to the assistant)}
<D>__{and you, michael... get the trunks one by one growing more and more fed up and we'll end on a gag which i will think of in a minute all right?}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{i don't feel it!}
<C>__{baden}
<D>__{don't feel it! do it!}
<C>__{assistant director}
<P>__{(hastily)}
<D>__{positions, everyone!}
<A>__{over mark's shoulder behind the camera we watch the unit taking up positions.}
<C>__{assistant director}
<D>__{anyone seen vivian?}
<C>__{baden}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{assistant director}
<D>__{the red headed bystander viv.}
<C>__{baden}
<P>__{(impatiently)}
<D>__{never mind i'm cutting her out of this scene... let's run it.}
<C>__{assistant director}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{quiet, everyone!}
<A>__{from mark's pov we watch the scene being rehearsed. diane approaches the trunk counter and the assistant smiles at her.}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{can i interest you in a trunk?}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{thank you...}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{i'd like to see that one...}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{certainly, madam...}
<A>__{he turns away. she pockets a small item from the counter. he heaves a trunk forward.}
<C>__{assistant director}
<D>__{it's beautifully fitted }
<P>__{(he opens it)}
<A>__{she takes a perfunctory glance }
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{i'd like to see one in red.}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{certainly, madam.}
<A>__{she pockets another item. he turns and wrestles with another trunk... brings it forward and opens it}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{... do you have one in white?}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{certainly, madam.}
<A>__{mark walks away quietly from the back of the camera crew. he hurries to the shelf where he keeps his cine camera and a lunch basket. he reaches for his camera. diane's voice is overlaid.}
<C>__{diane }
<D>__{do you have one in blue?}
<C>__{assistant }
<D>__{certainly, madam...}
<A>__{mark turns towards the rehearsal and raises his cine camera. we see the assistant try to lift a blue trunk and half collapse with the weight of it. close shot of baden beaming. the assistant manages to drag the trunk forward. he leans over it exhausted then starts to open it. mark moves round until diane's face is in the finder. as the lid of the trunk is opened we can see only her eyes above the rim of the lid... we hear her scream. close shot of baden freezing. there is the sound of a body falling to the ground.}
<C>__{baden}
<D>__{the silly bitch! she's fainted in the wrong scene...}
