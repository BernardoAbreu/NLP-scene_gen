<P>__{(defensive)}
<D>__{early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. i don't know why you're saying those things. you ain't my friend.}
<A>__{with that, adele stops her dancing and turns away from carrie... to see the male officer walking toward them.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{please don't say anything carrie.}
<A>__{the male officer continues toward them. it looks like he's talking to them... but his voice is inaudible under the deafening radio. new angle: favoring the two police officers the female officer sticks her head out of the police car and yells to her partner. he turns to listen.}
<C>__{female officer}
<D>__{we got a match, i will call for back up.}
<A>__{as the male officer turns back, he sees adele reach into the front seat of the lincoln. the male officer draws his revolver and levels it at adele. new angle: favoring adele and carrie click! adele shuts the radio off, total silence. as adele leans back out of the car, she turns, facing directly into the barrel of the male officer's gun.}
<C>__{male officer}
<D>__{all right ladies, i want both of you to slowly step away from the ca...}
<A>__{bang! a single gunshot rings out! the male officer jerks back and falls to the ground. adele screams! carrie whips a panicked glance around and sees... early running toward them. brian, bewildered, follows behind. brian's pov (running) ahead of him, he watches early race past the wounded male officer. he kicks the officer's revolver out of reach and rushes toward the police car. early fires his gun repeatedly as he charges the car! the female officer pulls her gun and starts to get out of the car, when... a shot shatters the windshield hitting her in the chest. she collapses back onto the seat.}
<B>__{on brian}
<A>__{he stops at the sight of the wounded male officer. shocked, he watches the man writhing in pain. his hands clutching his crotch. his blood oozes into the dirt. early approaches the police car. he sees the dead cop and hears the radio dispatcher.}
<C>__{police radio}
<D>__{officer needs help, shots fired, six adam five, one eighty seven, suspects wanted in multiple murders. location unknown, last seen...}
<A>__{brian is not sure what to do. he looks around... sees the officer's handgun lying in the dirt. he takes a step toward it, when... another gunshot rings out! brian stops. looks to the police car. he sees early standing there, smoke belching from the dashboard... the police radio is dead. early walks back toward brian and the others. he steps over to the injured male officer on the ground.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{tell me that don't hurt.}
<A>__{early picks up the wounded cop's gun. he hands it to brian as he trains the .45 automatic at brian's chest.}

<A>__{early cocks his pistol.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{...don't do it. early, look at him, look at his face. that's not your father.}
<A>__{early stares at the wounded cop's face.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{i know that. that there is a policeman in a world of pain. and this is what you call a mercy killin'.}
<A>__{early shoots the cop again. the cop lays still. early reaches down and takes the dead cop's handcuffs. he casually points the little camera at the dead cop. flash!!}
