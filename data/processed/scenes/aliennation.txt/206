<L>__{exterior dinghy night}
<A>__{the dinghy bangs along (at the end of the ten foot tie line) in the wake of the speeding fishing boat. harcourt claws his way toward sykes. water is already splashing in over the stern transom... the dinghy is sinking. harcourt grabs sykes' leg and pulls him toward him. sykes holds on to the stern cleats with all his might. harcourt yanks him free. sykes kicks wildly at the ratchet release, trying to free the remainder of the line. harcourt is coming in for the kill when sykes' foot connects with the ratchet lever. the rest of the tie line snakes through the ratchet, freeing the dinghy from the fishing boat! the dinghy is rocking wildly, sinking fast. a wave from the fishing boat's wake splashes in over the side. some of it hits harcourt he howls and falls away. sykes sees this, tries to clamber over the side, but harcourt is on him again. sykes' body weight at the side of the dinghy coupled with the rocking motion cause more water to wash in over the transom.}
