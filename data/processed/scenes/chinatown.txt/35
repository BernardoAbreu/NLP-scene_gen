<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(continuing)}

<D>__{is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{no!... yes, a little. you see hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{over the water department, or over you?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{not over me. why would they have a falling out over me?}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(noting her nervousness)}
<D>__{then it was over the water department.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{not exactly. well, i mean, yes. yes and no. hollis felt the public should own the water but i don't think my father felt that way. actually, it was over the van der lip. the dam that broke.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{oh, yeah?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{yes. he never forgave him for it.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{never forgave him for what?}

<D>__{for talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... they haven't spoken to this day.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(starts a little)}

<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{what about you? do you and your father get along?}

<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{sign here... the other copy's for you.}
<A>__{she signs it. when she looks back up, gittes is staring intently at her.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{what are you thinking?}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(picking up one of}
<D>__{copies, folding it, putting it in his}
<P>__{pocket)}
