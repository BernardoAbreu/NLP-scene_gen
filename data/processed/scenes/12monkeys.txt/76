<A>__{the three activists are tied tightly together in the middle of the floor in this dimly lit, windowless basement. they're very frightened, eager to cooperate.}

<D>__{tell me more about jeffrey.}
<C>__{fale}
<P>__{(a helpless shrug to his cohorts)}
<D>__{jeffrey started getting bored with the shit we do...picketing, leafleting, letter writing stuff. he said we were, "ineffectual liberal jerkoffs". he wanted to do guerrilla "actions" to "educate" the public.}

<C>__{fale}
<D>__{he goes on tv, gives a news conference, tells the whole world he just realized his daddy's experiments are vital for humanity and that the use of animals is absolutely necessary and that he, jeffrey mason, from now on, is going to personally supervise the labs to make sure all the little animals aren't going to suffer.}
