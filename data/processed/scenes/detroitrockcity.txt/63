<B>__{moments later}
<A>__{kenny, bobby, and barbara are now tied to the guardrail with jam's white corduroy pants, geeky belt, and plaid shirt. kenny and bobby rest their unconscious heads on each of barbara's shoulders. hawk, trip, lex, and jam look down at the two guidos and the stella, snickering.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{when they wake up, they're gonna come looking for you jerks. you best hope they don't find you, cause if they do, they're gonna kick your asses.}
<A>__{hawk grabs a cinderblock off the side of the road, walking up to the trans am.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{right, stella, and we'll deserve it. but let's really make it worth their while.}
<A>__{hawk puts the rock on the trans am's accelerator letting the engine whine in protest. (again we are cautious not to show the guidos' faces.)}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{by the way, when kenny wakes up could you give him a message for me. tell him, quote, kool and the gang bite my bag, motherfucker, unquote.}
<A>__{he throws the trans am into drive. all who are conscience listen to the brief screech, then watch the trans am as it barrels without a driver into the woods skirting the highway. it races into ditches, bounces off trees, and splashes through ponds, all smokey and the bandit like. the disco mobile ramps off the edge of an embankment, tumbles down a steep, rocky incline breaking apart along the way, and finally, boom! it explodes on final impact. the boys all look at each other and shrug. hawk walks back to the volvo and gets in. trip, lex, and jam follow suit and pile in as well. lex shouts back to barbara.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{oh, thanks for letting us draw from your ample make up supply. you must have the entire revlon factory in your purse!}
<A>__{angle on kenny, bobby, and barbara. we now see them from the front. lo and behold, kenny has been made up like gene simmons, bobby like paul stanley. whoever finds them is gonna get the wrong idea about their musical taste... and kick their asses all over again.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{very funny. i hope you choke!}
<C>__{stella on board}
