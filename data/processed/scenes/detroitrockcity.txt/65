<L>__{interior volvo day}
<A>__{christine sits between jam and lex in the back snapping gum. jam and lex stare at her like cats looking at a fish bowl. hawk looks in the rearview mirror at christine checking herself in a compact. she swathes on some 7 up flavored, bonnie bell lip gloss. trip meanwhile twirls the joint he's just finished rolling in his mouth, sealing it. he winks at her disgustingly.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{oh, great. i just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... i'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown detroit called disco inferno. mind droppin' me there?}
<C>__{trip}
<P>__{(smirks)}
<D>__{what's it worth to you?}
<C>__{christine}
<P>__{(grossed out)}
<D>__{what the hell is that supposed to mean?}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{it doesn't mean anything. don't pay attention to him.}
<C>__{hawk}
<P>__{(rolls his eyes)}
<D>__{disco inferno? disco's infernal morelike.}
<A>__{trying to be suave, lex moves in close, putting the make on her.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{your clothes may say disco, but your eyes say rock 'n' roll, baby.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{well, your tee shirt may say rock 'n' roll, but your breath says pepperoni, baby.}
<A>__{she pushes him away. jam laughs.}
<C>__{trip}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{so, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?}
<C>__{christine}
<P>__{(thoroughly offended)}
<D>__{what? that's disgusting!}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{trip! that's so fuckin' rude, man.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{oh, quit bein' the wussy, sensitive guy to impress her, jam. she's obviously not gonna put out. she's a fuckin' tease.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{tease? what the hell did i do to tease you mongoloids?}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{you got in the car, didn't you?}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{oh, god, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{whatever... stella.}
<A>__{trip lights the joint and takes a lungful of pot. he passes it to lex and the joint begins to make its rounds with the exception of christine. the car starts to fill with smoke.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{the name's christine, not stella. and there's no need to be such pigs just cause i prefer donna summer or kc and the sunshine boys or the village people over kiss?}
<C>__{hawk}
<P>__{(with disdain)}
<D>__{the village people? they're fags! you're a fag hag!}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{come on, hawk.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{i can take care of myself, but thanks anyway, germ.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{jam.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{whatever.}
<P>__{(to hawk)}
<D>__{okay, joe burnout, let's get one thing straight here. as far as i'm concerned good tunes is good tunes, be it disco or rock or polka or whatever have you, regardless of the category. true, if i had to choose, i'd pick the category labelled disco because i happen to enjoy dancing. disco is just easier to dance to.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{you call that john travolta denny terio shit dancing? i wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{disco blows dogs for quarters.}
<A>__{christine processes this remark.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{now there's an intelligently biting remark wrought with wit and irony.}
<A>__{trip looks confused, then smiles thinking she paid him a compliment.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{hey, if you don't like that one, maybe you'll think it's funny when we throw your ass out the goddamn car!}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{yeah, why don't you put your money where your mouth is?}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{why don't you kiss my hairy crack?}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{why don't you bend over, you're looking right at it!}
<A>__{all, christine included, pause to think about what that comment was supposed to mean. lex takes a hit off the jointerior}
<C>__{lex}
<P>__{(holding in smoke)}
<D>__{that last remark fell about 30 yards away from making any sense whatsoever.}
<A>__{hawk and trip immediately bust into the giggles and it doesn't take long for lex and jam to follow suit.}
<C>__{christine}
<P>__{(realization)}
<D>__{hey, you're right. "bend over you're looking right at it?!"}
<P>__{(starts to laugh)}
<D>__{what's that supposed to mean anyway?}
<A>__{christine succumbs to the contagious giggle epidemic and the whole car gets a great laugh for a while. they finally calm down again and wipe tears from their eyes. lex still has the joint now as christine looks at it.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{man, this is some kickass shit!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{gimme a hit off that jay will ya?}
<A>__{lex smiles despite himself and holds the weed out to her as we...}
