<C>__{tom}
<D>__{he's not there.}
<P>__{(crossing to helen)}
<D>__{but look what i found in his room}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(takes the stone and}

<P>__{by its size)}
<D>__{is it real?}

<C>__{helen}
<D>__{he gave these to you?}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(guilty for his own sharp dealing)}
<D>__{well, not exactly. i gave him two dollars.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{this doesn't make sense... i think the guy's a crook. i never did trust him.}
<A>__{helen tries to shush tom, not wanting to re stimulate bobby's imagination, but it's too late.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{gee, mom, do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?}

<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(seriously concerned)}
<D>__{you think it's all right for you to stay here?}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(nods reassuringly)}

<D>__{yes, dear. come on now.}
<P>__{(she happens to look}
<D>__{down at his feet. puzzled, and concerned, she feels}
<P>__{his shoes)}
<D>__{bobby, your shoes are soaking!}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(reluctantly, with childish guilt)}
<D>__{yeah the grass was kind of wet.}
<A>__{as the impact of this sinks in, helen and tom turn to stare at each other in questioning consternation.}
