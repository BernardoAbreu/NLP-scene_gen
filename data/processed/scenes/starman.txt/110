<L>__{exterior interstate 29 day}
<A>__{the mustang cruises along between fields of corn.}
<C>__{jenny }
<D>__{why did your ship land on this planet... on earth?}
<C>__{star man }
<D>__{it was a mistake.}
<L>__{interior exterior mustang day}
<A>__{the following conversation will be played over various views of americana: a station wagon load of kids, waving and laughing, lovers kissing at a bus stop, billboards, car lots, a dog taking a leak against a tree, cheerleaders practicing on a football field, a funeral cortege, a telephone repairman up on a pole.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you thought we were a different planet?!}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{no. my ship was doing a map of all the suns and...}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{stars... when a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{we were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. my... eh... we kidnapped it. on it there was a map that said how to come to earth. this was very important. before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you did? that's funny. so did we.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{we told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. just to look from up there. we came and... the driver of my ship...}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{the captain...}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{the captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from earth to take home. the police came and shot at us. one of the people from my ship was killed.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{oh, that's terrible. i'm sorry. was he a good friend?}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{i don't understand 'friend.'}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{a friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{he was a good friend... the captain took the ship away fast and i was not in the ship.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{the police shouldn't have started shooting. but you can hardly blame them. you surprised them. they didn't know you were up there. when they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{i understand.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{what is hell?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{it's bad.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{he will.}
<A>__{pause. jenny feels the star man staring at her. she turns to look at him. his gaze doesn't waver. she looks back at the road, then back at the star man.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{are you my friend?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{star man}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i am your friend.}
