<TRANS>__{TITLES OVER:}
<ACTION>__{A padded wall is papered with NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS that date back to the early 1900s: "LOCAL FOWLER BROTHERS LOSE $35 TICKETS TO BOARD TITANIC" appears over "FOWLER BROTHERS KILLED IN COAL MINE MISHAP." Another series of articles reads, "JEWISH PROFESSOR DENIED ADMITTANCE TO HINDENBURG" and "PROFESSOR RABINOWITZ KILLED IN AVALANCHE." Etc... Continuing along the wall, the newspaper articles all focus on the fates of the original SURVIVORS of the FLIGHT 180 CRASH. We DISSOLVE : between the various headlines depicting the gruesome deaths of Tod, Terry, Ms. Lewton, Billy Hitchcock, Carter and Alex Browning. Also in the mix are various CRIME SCENE PHOTOS of the deaths. Decapitated torsos, crushed, mangled bodies, the charred remains of another and the face- down body of Alex Browning. MAPS line the walls as well, pinpointing the locations of numerous deaths, perhaps seeking a pattern. Charts that timeline bizarre deaths, seating charts of downed aircraft, etc... LATEX -GLOVED HANDS tear out the last article, apply fun- tack to its corners and place it in the center of all the others: A REMEMBRANCE FOR THE VICTIMS OF FLIGHT 180 Friday marks one year anniversary.}

<ACTION_ALT>__{INSIDE NISSAN SUV}
<ACTION>__{Kimberly falls back into the right lane and looks uneasy as she sees a TRUCK DRIVER guzzling from a flask as it passes the SUV, revealing its side is an ad for FIRESTONE TIRES. It finally clears frame, revealing a highway billboard that reads, "DRUNK DRIVING KILLS." Kimberly reaches back and pulls on her seatbelt in spite of laughter from the back seat. Up ahead, the RUSTY CHAIN seems to have more give to it. LOGS STRAIN against it. Suddenly, a black cloud of exhaust from a blue '83 Chevette in front of them causes everyone to roll up their windows. OIL DRIPS from its rusty exhaust pipe. The thick exhaust BLINDS Kimberly.}
<CHAR>__{FRANKIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Gas it around these idiots. We do have 1200 miles to go, you know.}
<ACTION>__{Kimberly tires to enter the passing lane, but she's blocked by a SUBURU WAGON. In the front seat, a seven- year old kid is sadistically SMASHING two toy cars together. Kimberly passes the Suburu and pulls up to a PACER. The Harley roars by, startling her.}

<ACTION>__{Shaina smiles in understanding.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{INSIDE POLICE CRUISER}
<ACTION>__{Thomas bends to wipe up the mess. He only glances at the road as he tries to soak up the coffee. Suddenly up ahead, THE RUSTY CHAIN SNAPS! The logs roll off the side of the truck onto the highway. One bounces as it hits, and slams through Thomas' front winshield and out the back, taking Thomas' head with it. EUGENE slams on his brakes. His Harley slides out and he is SLAMMED to the ground, sliding at 60 miles per hour across the highway, right in front of the yellow mini-bus. The MINI- BUS DRIVER brakes to avoid Eugene. The FOOTBALL PLAYERS tumble forward and hit him in the head. He loses control and slides off the road onto the grass median. He blows a front tire and the mini-bus begins to flip, ROLLING several times int o the oncoming lanes of traffic, and is HIT by a}
<ACTION_ALT>__{MACK TRUCK.}
<ACTION>__{Eugene slides into a huge log, and hits it with a sickening crunch. Only to be HIT and CRUSHED by his sliding motorcycle. Rory looks up too late and REAR ENDS Thomas' car, EXPLODING the gas tank and HURLING Rory's dead body halfway through the windshield where it remains half in/half onto the hood. KAT, dialing, looks up, slams on her brakes, but SKIDS on oil from the Chevette. She swerves into Kimberly, SIDE SWIPES her, then swerves to miss a huge log -- only to run head on into two more, flipping the Expedition end over end right next to Kimberly. Kimberly swerves back from being hit by Kat, just in time to see a huge log ahead. She tries to turn hard to the right to avoid it, but hits it broadside -- Sending the SUV FLIPPING OVER the top of the log and SLIDING down the road. Inside, Shaina, Dano and Frankie are tossed around like rag dolls, shredded by glass and shrapnel -- Frankie is EJECTED out the side window. Kimberly's SUV slides to a stop on its side. She looks back to her mangled but still alive friends and up in time to see NORA'S PACER Nora sees the collisions ahead and slams on the brakes but the fallen Naya bottle prevents her from braking, and she SLAMS into the back of Kat's Expedition. The crash test dummy collision folds her Pacer and it EXPLODES into a huge fireball. EVAN, blinded by the smeared windshield, is too late. He swerves his Trans Am around the burning cars onto the wet grass. Kimberly sees the topless Trans Am slowly roll out of a huge WALL OF FIRE and coast to a stop. Evan comes up battered and bloody but still alive. He is trapped in his burning car, screaming and trying to release the seatbelt. Then, just when she thought it was over, a HUGE SEMI slides thro ugh the wall of fire, SMASHING the Trans Am out of the way, SPINNING it like a top. With the back sliding at 90 degrees it keeps on coming. KIMBERLY'S POV The semi's grill comes right at her!}
