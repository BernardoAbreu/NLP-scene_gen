<D>__{they're trapping us like ants in a log! once they have all the exits blocked, they'll come in through the last one!}
<A>__{they see a way out, head for that exit, only to find a spider coming through it. mike tosses one of his perfume grenades at the spider, covering their retreat. another spider comes after them through one of the tubes. mike chucks another perfume bottle. the spider cowers.}
