<L>__{interior other sewers night}
<A>__{the group wades through the water, single file. conan notices hieroglyphics and carvings on the wall of the catacomb. massive creatures of the sea, dark sorcery, ritual sacrifice.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{a warning. these catacombs are connected to the sea. it says that the beasts of acheron protect its secrets.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{not from me.}
<A>__{conan presses on, into the darkness.}
<L>__{interior cistern night}
<A>__{the catacomb widens out to a giant circular cistern, its walls rising up high into the darkness. as the torches bring light to the space, we see hundreds of dead, rotting bodies. as conan and tamara walk forward, the one eyed thief and the other stop at the entrance.}
<C>__{one eyed thief}
<D>__{sorry, friend. we stop here. we've heard too much about what lies within to go any further.}
<A>__{conan simply nods and the thieves depart. conan raises his torch, illuminating the near wall.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{where now?}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{around. up.}
<A>__{conan heads off one direction, leaving tamara to navigate the other half. her torch illuminates the grizzly path ahead. she inhales deeply and takes her first step.}
<B>__{conan}
<A>__{following the slick wall, he passes many dead bodies, but only one catches his eye. he stops before it.}
<B>__{dead warrior}
<A>__{nothing more than a skeleton, picked clean by the rats. but he still bears his leather armor, and a horned helmet that resembles his father's own. conan takes the helmet and places it on his head. it fits perfectly.}
<B>__{tamara}
<A>__{tamara is gingerly making her way through the knee high sewage water and the dead bodies submerged within.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{oh!!!}
<A>__{tamara leaps up, swinging the torch down towards the water. conan, nearby, unsheathes his sword.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{something touched me. something slimy.}
<A>__{conan walks over, the torchlight revealing something on tamara's leg. it's a slug, which he flicks off.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{crom! stop wasting time.}
<A>__{but when conan steps forward, something roils the water right before him. he spots a huge tentacle just before its submerges back into the water.}
<C>__{conan }
<D>__{crom indeed.}
<A>__{then tamara screams as another tentacle rises up from the water, wrapping around her waist. tamara grabs hold of the wall as the tentacle tries to pull her underwater. conan immediately slashes the tentacle, pulling tamara away. the squirming decapitated tentacle squirts black blood everywhere, the knee high water seems to come alive with roiling intensity. conan spins, finding a circular stone staircase tiled into the far cistern wall.}
<C>__{conan }
<D>__{let's go.}
