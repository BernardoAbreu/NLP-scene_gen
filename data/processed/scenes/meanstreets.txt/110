<A>__{a long haired rock group the lead guitarist holds his guitar out like a machine gun and strums frantically on it swinging it back and forth at the audience and then at the rest of the group. as he does so, the rest of the group falls "dead" over their instruments. the number is over and they all get up. the place is empty except for charlie, tony, and a few others, all of whom have been listening to the band. they applaude.}
