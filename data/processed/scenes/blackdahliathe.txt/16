<A>__{a bony old man sits in a broken chair, aiming a bb pistol at some balsa wood airplanes scattered in the yard. on bucky's face disgust and sadness. this is dolph bleichert, bucky's father. bucky approaches, pulling a chair up next to his father. up close it's even worse: white skin stretched tight over blue veins, yellow rimming his rheumy eyes. flecks of dirt and vomit on a filthy shirt.}
