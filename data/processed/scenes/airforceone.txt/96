<L>__{interior white house situation room day}
<A>__{a map of air force one's flight trajectory is displayed on the rear screen. moscow to berlin and back toward the black sea. the assembled brass listens as korshunov's voice slithers off the speaker phone.}
<C>__{korshunov }
<D>__{...the chief of staff, the first lady, and the first daughter. our demands are simple. arrange the release of ivan stravanvitch. once our leader is returned to turkuenistan soil, air force one and it's occupants will be allowed safe passage to switzerland. you have one hour before we start killing hostages.}
<A>__{the phone clicks off. a silent beat in the room.}
<C>__{v.p. chandler}

<C>__{v.p. chandler}
<D>__{but not the president. not the president.}
<A>__{a silent beat.}
<C>__{general northwood}
<D>__{he's dead then. they must have killed him.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{we don't know that.}
<C>__{general northwood}
<D>__{holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you're making demands.}
<C>__{v.p. chandler}
<D>__{and if he's dead? do you really think they'd risk telling us?}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{there is a possibility we're overlooking.}
<A>__{all eyes turn to dean.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{when i ran specops in `nam, i ordered the destruction of a v.c. munitions dump. during insertion, the plane was shot down and the entire team was killed, or so we thought. two days later the dump}
<A>__{blew and a week after that, this 19 year old kid, the pilot... he walks out of the jungle in pretty bad shape. he survived the crash and finished the mission... alone.}
<C>__{general northwood}

<C>__{dean}
<D>__{that kid's name was jim marshall.}
