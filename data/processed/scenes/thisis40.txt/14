<A>__{debbie is doing sit ups while talking to jason, who holds her feet down. in the background, barb stretches on a yoga ball.}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{so why on earth is pete taking viagra? what's going on?}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{i don't know. i think maybe he just isn't attracted to me anymore.}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{that is ridiculous. if you were my girlfriend, i would not need a viagra. i would need an anti viagra pill. to try not to get a boner.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{but everyone gives you a boner.}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{don't sell yourself short like that. you give me a boner.}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{barb doesn't give me a boner.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{maybe things are just getting stale. that's why maybe i work out really hard. maybe he'll be able to get a boner again.}
<C>__{barb}
<D>__{why do you need to have sex, deb? sex is the number one thing people fight about.}
<C>__{barb }
<D>__{you stop having sex, there will be no more fights. i am living proof. i have no sex, and i am the happiest i've ever been.}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{i knew it. i knew you were not having sex. i can see it on your face. it's all puckered and pained.}
<C>__{barb}
<D>__{i'm enjoying our non sex period, that's all i'm saying.}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{don't you miss it?}
<C>__{barb}
<D>__{well, i wouldn't know, because i don't have any feeling down there anymore. i have nerve damage from my c section so everything is just kinda }
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{she's numb down there.}
<C>__{barb}
<D>__{i could sit down hard on a fire hydrant, and i wouldn't even know that i was sitting. i could get stung by a hornet down there, and i would not feel it. you could put anything in there, and i would not know what the object was. i used to pee in a nice stream, and now it just kind of goes like a shower head.}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{that is the saddest thing i've ever heard.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{i think you need a family. don't you want a family?}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{no, i think i want to clooney it.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{clooney it?}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{yup.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{he doesn't seem happy.}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{yeah, he is.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{no. he's lonely.}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{no, he's not.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{see, i think he has sad eyes.}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{aw, you sweet little thing. he's doing sad, lonely eyes. to get the next lady. i can do it too, watch.}
<A>__{jason demonstrates.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{i bet george clooney is really lonely. just him and his pig.}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{you'd fuck him.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{i wouldn't.}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{so would you.}
<C>__{barb}
<D>__{i would. i wouldn't feel it but }
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{you'd fuck him with your numb vagina. yes, you would. ocean's thirteen inches, that's what you'd find out.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{do you think?}
