<L>__{exterior a deserted road dawn}
<A>__{charlie crawls on all fours through the gravel at the side of the road. a police car whizzes by, but we hear it slow down and pull over. as the car doors open, then slam shut, charlie looks up, only now aware of the cops. he collapses into the gravel.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior hospital room day}
<A>__{charlie lays in bed, casts on both arms and one of his legs. the right side of his face sags where his facial muscles were cut, giving him a particularly sinister look. gay tries to help him turn over on his side.}
<C>__{gay orlova}
<D>__{pull yourself toward me.}
<A>__{grimacing at the pain, charlie grabs the edge of the bed and pulls himself over on his right side, leaving his bare backside facing the door. gay uses a washcloth to wipe sweat from his forehead. charlie grabs it away from her and uses it to hide the tears of pain welling in his eyes.}
<C>__{gay orlova}
<D>__{i booked passage to london.}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{london?}
<C>__{gay orlova}

<C>__{lansky}
<D>__{you're getting' 10 cc's}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{i told you twenty!}
<A>__{paying him no mind, lansky pulls a vial and a hypodermic out of his pocket. filling the syringe, he leans over charlie's ass.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{relax, charlie.}
<A>__{charlie grasps gay's hand, then reacts to the needle.}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{you bastards, i said twenty!}
<C>__{lansky}
<D>__{it'll just be a few minutes.}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{i need the twenty!}
<A>__{but charlie realizes that his protests are to no avail.}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{fuck you all.}
<A>__{losing her composure, gay runs from the room. charlie, calls after her.}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{not you!}
<A>__{but she's gone. costello pushes the door shut behind her.}

<C>__{siegel}
<D>__{that's just what they're calling ya pal. lucky luciano.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{masseria's confused. he can't figure whether you're workin' for maranzano, or gettin' ready to kill the bastard. so he's spreadin' the word that you're goin' after profaci because it happened on his turf. i figure masseria's gonna try to rub out profaci, and pin it on us. then maranzano will have to kill ya.}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{you got men on profaci's place?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{we got our boys paintin' the house next door. around the clock. we're gonna keep old man profaci alive if it takes twenty coats.}
<C>__{lansky}
<D>__{tommy reina's gone over to maranzano, but so far masseria ain't lifted a finger,}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{the fat man's scared. scared of us, and scared without us. same with maranzano. we gotta get their minds back on each other. this fuckin' peace is killin' us.}
<C>__{lansky}
<D>__{we can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{lansky}
<D>__{tommy reina.}
<C>__{siegel}
<D>__{what you mean? tommy ain't done nothin'.}
<C>__{lansky}
<D>__{maranzano will think masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.}
<C>__{siegel}
<D>__{why's it gotta be tommy!}
<C>__{lansky}
<D>__{masseria won't have any choice but to trust you. and as long as we keep the boss alive, maranzano can't win without you.}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{don't touch tommy until masseria goes after profaci.}
<A>__{siegel explodes.}
<C>__{siegel}
<D>__{jesus christ will ya listen to me!}
<A>__{now he has their attention.}
<C>__{siegel}
<D>__{i'm a hard guy. i done more jobs than alla you combined. and i never said no. not once. but dammit i don't understand why the hell we gotta kill our friends!}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{because the world ain't big enough for the dons. so we gotta choose between our friends and ourselves. it ain't the way i'd make the world, but that's the way it is.}
<C>__{lansky}
<D>__{we're gonna change it, bugs. once we get rid of the dons, the commission's gonna rule. no more wars. no more vendettas. no more boss of all the bosses.}
<C>__{siegel}
