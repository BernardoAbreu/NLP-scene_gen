<A>__{duke enters old levis, grubby sneakers, 10 peso acapulco shirt coming apart at the seams, 3 day growth, eyes hidden behind mirror shades. he heads for the check in line.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{my arrival was badly timed.}
<A>__{the place is full of cops. 200 of them, on vacation, all dressed in cut price vegas casuals: plaid bermuda shorts, arnie palmer golf shirts, and rubberized beach sandals. ahead of duke a police chief argues with the desk clerk. the police chief's agnew style wife stands to the side, weeping. the police chief's friends stand uneasily around.}
<C>__{police chief}
<D>__{what do you mean i'm too late to register? i'm a police chief. from michigan. look, fella, i told you.}
<P>__{(waves a postcard)}
<D>__{i have a postcard here that says i have reservations in this hotel.}
<C>__{clerk}
<P>__{(prissily)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, sir. you're on the "late list." your reservations were transferred to the... ah... moonlight motel, which is out on paradise boulevard...}
<C>__{police chief}
<D>__{i've already paid for my goddamn room!}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{it's actually a very fine place of lodging and only sixteen blocks from here, with its own pool and...}
<C>__{police chief}
<D>__{you dirty little faggot! call the manager! i'm tired of listening to this dogshit!}
<A>__{friends restrain the police chief.}
<C>__{clerk}
<P>__{(solicitously)}
<D>__{i'm so sorry, sir. may i call you a cab?}
<A>__{the police chief's screamed insults fade away...}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{of course, i could hear what the clerk was really saying...}
<C>__{clerk}
<P>__{(in duke's imagination)}
<D>__{listen, you fuzzy little shithead i've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross section of mean tempered rule crazy cops and now it's my turn. "fuck you, officer, i'm in charge here, and i'm telling you we don't have room for you."}
<A>__{duke steps to the desk, around the raging police chief.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{say. i hate to interrupt, but i wonder if maybe i could just sort of slide through and get out of your way. name's raoul duke raoul duke. my attorney made the reservation.}
<A>__{duke snaps a credit card down onto the counter. everyone goes silent. the police chief group stares at him like he was some kid of water rat crawling up to the desk. the clerk hits the bell for the bellboy.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{certainly, mr. duke!}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{my bags are out there in that white cadillac convertible. can you have someone drive it around to the room?}
<A>__{all eyes turn to the gleaming white whale.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{oh, and could i get a quart of wild turkey, two fifths of baccardi, and a night's worth of ice delivered to my room, please?}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{don't worry about a thing, sir. just enjoy your stay.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{well, thank you.}
<A>__{duke gives the police chief a polite smile crosses to the elevator turns to face the gawping cops pops a can of beer and toasts them. the doors close.}
