<L>__{exterior concrete ditch day}
<A>__{the fence runs straight to the edge of the ditch, an eight foot wide gap yawning dead ahead. the creature churns like a locomotive from behind. they'll have to try to jump! they strain desperately for every last fraction of speed.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{we can do it, we can do it!}
<A>__{they leap and they don't do it!! they smack into the opposite side of the ditch, clawing frantically at the lip, only to tumble to its sloping bottom. a split second later the charging creature slams like a wrecking ball into the foot thick concrete wall! the wall cracks and bulges out! a hook tentacle flops out through one of the cracks! terrified val and earl scramble away. but the wall holds together. and the, strangely, all is quiet. the tentacle lays dead still. eventually, the cowering cowboys dare to creep back a little closer, still panting, exhausted, jumpy.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{stupid son of a bitch...knocked itself cold.}
<A>__{and now orange slime begins to ooze through the cracks in the concrete.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{cold, my ass! it's dead! we killed the bastard!}
<A>__{he suddenly shakes his fist at the dead beast.}
<C>__{val }
<D>__{you fucker!!}
<A>__{they allow themselves a small wheeze of nervous laughter, only to jump like rabbits as some pebbles rattle loudly down the concrete wall behind them. they whirl to see rhonda, up on the opposite side of the ditch, staring down at them. she's lugging a bunch of her equipment, including a small folding shovel.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{hi, guys, how're you doing? look, can i ask you something? did you just notice something weird? vibrations? you know, some kind of earth tremor?}
<A>__{val and earl look at each other, then burst out laughing. rhonda spots the cracked wall.}
<C>__{rhonda }
<D>__{what's that?}
