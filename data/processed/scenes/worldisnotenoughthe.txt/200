<A>__{bond sees zukovsky and christmas swimming to safety. the chopper bears down on him. he leaps back to what's left of the building, picks up a flare gun. he jumps down to a walkway at water level and cranks open a rusted gas jet...he then waits for the chopper to line up over it as it approaches bond for the kill.... bond fires the flare gun... the gas explodes! the chopper tries to pull away, but it's too late. the flames engulf it, igniting a fireball.}
