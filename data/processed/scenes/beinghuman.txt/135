<L>__{exterior forest day}
<A>__{they are on the valley floor now. the trees are more openly spaced and the grass is richer. they are moving quickly but they have a hard time keeping the horse on the trot. it hasn't seen grass this good in weeks.}
<L>__{exterior forest day}
<A>__{they are moving more slowly, the ground is rockier and the trees are thickening. they take the easy way up the hillside, a natural path made by deer or bear. it is difficult to know who is more shaken by their encounter, the indian or hector and bobby. the indian is sitting behind a tree as they pass, dozing or deep in reverie. they almost pass without noticing him, but hector gives a turn of his head and there is the indian four feet from him. at the same instant the indian comes to his senses and sits bolt upright. the encounter is high comedy but full of terror for all of them. the indian stands up. hector absurdly greets him.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{hi! hello!}
<A>__{the indian backs off from them, holding his hands up and smiling crazily, as if to say, "don't mind me, boys, i'm just leaving..." hector and bobby are equally silly in their response.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{hey, come back... we're just moving through... don't apologize... we all got a fright... goodbye...}
<A>__{the indian is in full retreat now, waving his hands about apologetically, but making good distance from them. suddenly, he is gone. it has happened so quickly that hector and bobby scarcely believe it has happened. then they realize that in their fright they have let go of the horse. it has headed back down to the tastier pastures in the valley. they see it disappearing into the trees below them.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{that was stupid...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{did you see him?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{sure i saw him.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{was he a delaware?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{how the fuck should i know? he was an indian... and indians don't come in ones...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{yeah... i think he was an indian too... what about the horse?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i'm not going back down there.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{don't panic, bobby...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{why not?}
<A>__{he runs off into the forest. then he turns and shouts to hector.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{come on!}
<A>__{hector follows him, a mad race through the forest.}
