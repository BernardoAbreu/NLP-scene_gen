<D>__{i don't know what i had envisaged it would be like, the first time i mean. but that wasn't the image i had. i thought there would be more to it. not that it was unpleasant. after all, i was in bed with a naked woman. she complimented me on my shirt and my hair. she held my penis. i haven't even seen my penis for over thirty years. anyway, onward. am i sharing too much?}
