<L>__{int: apartment building, another hall night}
<A>__{...to fall, a dead weight, crashing down onto the floor of the hall in a hail of debris. edgar is on top of silus and strangling him, and then he stops and turns. he moves just in time to avoid a bullet from jones' gun which glances edgar's cheek, sending off a wisp of burnt colored smoke. cut to jones. gun smoking, standing at the other end of the hall. edgar screams the scream of something from the animal kingdom. then turns and runs. cut to silus rising, pulling out his gun. jones points his gun, but silus is obscuring his view. cut to edgar runs away down the hall. then on silus. very still, very silent. close on his finger pressing the trigger. the camera zooms right into the interior of the gun to see the projectile entering the gun's chamber and the hammer igniting it. the projectile explodes out the end of the gun. high angle of the projectile flying towards its target, the ceiling lights above streaking past on its reflective surface, cruel mechanical claws suddenly slide out from the side of the capsule. then edgar, camera tracking back at high speed. slow move in on silus' cool gray eyes. then whack! the projectile stabs into edgar's back, the claws springing forward to hook onto edgar's flesh, we see the fluid within the transparent projectile flow into edgar, see edgar's eyes widen, see his pov of the approaching window then... crash. edgar's head implants itself in the wall below the window, the dust and debris from the wall board drifting over edgar's numb stare. in the background silus stands. motionless. we see jones walking forward, gun still pointing, heading towards edgar. silus turns and steps in front of him.}
