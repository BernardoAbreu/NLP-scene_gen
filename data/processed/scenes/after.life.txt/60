<L>__{interior funeral home. kitchen day}
<A>__{eliot turns on the taps. fills a copper kettle.}
<L>__{interior funeral home. prep room same time}
<A>__{silence. o.s. a shuddering pipe bangs ominously. anna opens her eyes abruptly as if waking from a deep sleep. she stares at us. numb.}
<L>__{interior funeral home. kitchen moments later}
<A>__{close on an exploding blue flame from a gas ring. we pull back. eliot places a kettle on the ring. then measures out exactly two spoons of tea from an ornate tin into a teapot. meticulous in everything he does.}
<L>__{interior funeral home. prep room same time}
<A>__{close on anna's hand. her fingers flex slightly. she pushes herself up awkwardly. suddenly realizes something. she touches her wrist. desperately searching for her pulse. then frantically checks her neck. panicking. she can't find her heartbeat. she stares at her hand. then abruptly slams it against the slab. hard. she feels no pain. she does it again. harder. still nothing.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i must be in shock. that's all. it's just shock.}
<A>__{she struggles to her feet. stumbles groggily to the door. tries the door handle. it's locked. she bangs on the door feebly. then she hears something. she cocks her head. follows the sound of eliot's footsteps upstairs.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(hoarse)}
<D>__{let me out!}
