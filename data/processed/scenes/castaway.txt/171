<A>__{he dumps the firewood on the floor of the cave. but where the fire had flickered, there is only a pile of wet black ashes.}
<B>__{the fire is out.}
<L>__{interior cave night}
<A>__{chuck lies on the floor of the cave, shivering in the darkness as the rain falls. his fire is out, his tooth is killing him, he can't escape.}
<L>__{exterior cave next day}
<A>__{chuck emerges from the cave. the rain has stopped. this is the absolute lowest. his face reflects his pain and despair. he's trapped. it's hopeless. everything he tried to build is gone.}
<L>__{exterior ledge day}
<A>__{chuck slowly walks out on the ledge. he stares down at the waves breaking on the jagged rocks far below. he lets go one hand. then lets go the other. he is barely balanced. it looks like a wisp of breeze would blow him right off. he slides one foot to the very lip of the precipice. suddenly his foot slips! instinctively he turns into the cliff, grabs for a hold! one hand reaches for a nubbing of rock, slips off! the other closes, his fingers straining to hold him. he breathes in deep gasps. he had wanted to end it, come so close.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{what the fuck are you doing?}
<A>__{his deepest instinct was to survive. and that is what he is going to do.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{hang on. just hang on.}
<A>__{slowly he pulls himself back from the edge.}
