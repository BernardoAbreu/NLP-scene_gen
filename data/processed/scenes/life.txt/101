<A>__{superintendent abernathy paces anxiously in front of a white curtain surrounding mae rose's bed. suddenly, mrs abernathy staggers out from behind the curtain with a stricken look on her face. she tries to speak, but words fail her. her legs go wobbly and she faints dead away.}

<D>__{uh, doctor...}
<A>__{the doctor steps from behind the curtain, drawing it behind him. he checks mrs. abernathy's pulse.}

<D>__{he's a big one.}

<D>__{it's a boy! well, let's get a look at him.}
<A>__{abernathy pushes past the doctor and yanks open the curtain. mae rose is propped up in bed, looking exhausted.}
<C>__{abernathy}
<D>__{well, where is he? where's my new grandson?}
<A>__{the nurse turns around, cradling the baby in her arms. abernathy gently pulls back the soft blanket. his eyes widen with horror upon discovering that the newest member of the abernathy family is black.}
