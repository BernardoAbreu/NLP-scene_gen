<L>__{interior tudor's apartment night}
<A>__{tudor lies on top of janine on their bed. over his shoulder, janine's face is visible, eyes wide open and full of tears. she tries to push tudor away, but he resists.}
<C>__{janine}
<P>__{(frantically)}
<D>__{no, no. nick, please. stop. let's stop. i... i want to put my contacts in... i can't see anything...}
<A>__{tudor pulls her back to him, and finally she is forced to batter him away with her fists and slip off the edge of the bed. tudor glares after her.}
<C>__{tudor}
<P>__{(in a mechanical whine)}
<D>__{make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me...}
<C>__{janine}
<P>__{(trying to buy time)}
<D>__{i want to be able to see us, nick. i... i'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, ok? is that ok?}
<P>__{(pleading with him to believe her)}
<D>__{i want to be able to see us when we make love, ok?}
<A>__{tudor's eyes are staring right out of his head and his mouth is wide open. he gasps for breath. he stares at janine for a second, then buries his face in the blankets, twisting them in his hands and moaning. janine bursts into tears and turns away from the bed, heading for the bathroom. in the bathroom, janine starts to shake, on the verge of hysteria. distractedly, she goes through the motions of putting her contact lenses in: opens the medicine cabinet door, takes out the lens container, takes out the bottles of wetting and soaking solutions, opens the lens container. suddenly, tudor wails terribly, like a hound, from the bedroom.}
<C>__{tudor}
<P>__{(heart rending wail)}
<D>__{ooooooooooooooooo!}
<A>__{janine turns to the door, turns back to the lenses, dumps both lenses out into her hand, begins to squirt solution on them. she has decided to try to ignore tudor.}
<C>__{tudor}
<P>__{(wailing)}
<D>__{janine, janine, janinnnnnneeee!}
<A>__{janine can no longer pretend that she doesn't hear him. closing her hand around the two lenses, she runs out of the bathroom. tudor lies outstretched on the bed in the darkness. his lips move silently, spasmically, as though in sleep, twitching in an abnormal, insect fashion. there is a swelling in his throat, almost as though he has developed a goiter, which swells and contracts rhythmically. janine appears in the doorway.}
<C>__{janine}
<P>__{(a strangled half whisper)}
<D>__{i'm here, nick. janine is here.}
<A>__{after a pause, she walks into the room. she climbs on to the bed and settles down. she puts her face very close to tudor's. for the moment, his face is expressionless, but his neck is swollen just under the jaw. janine sighs deeply, trying not to panic. her eyes narrow suddenly she hasn't got her lenses in and her gaze is myopic as she notices something odd. there is a bit of black something, a thread, in the corner of tudor's mouth. janine moves closer to it. the black thing, like the tip of an insect's leg, twitches. janine reaches out to brush the thing off tudor's lip. as her fingers brush by, the leg twitches back inside tudor's mouth. janine jerks back in horror, her hands, balled into fists, cover her own mouth as though to protect it from whatever occupies tudor's mouth. gradually the thread reappears. tudor's lips part slightly to allow the emergence of the dark, viscous tentacle to which the thread a hook used to hang on inside the body is attached. the tentacle of the blood parasite probes its way from between tudor's lips. janine is paralyzed with horror. the tentacle is now touching tudor's chin, his cheek, the tip of his nose. janine's fists tighten even more. a glassy snap breaks the silence. janine lowers her hands dumbly and opens them. in the right one, the one that held the contact lenses, are incised two bloody circles where her fingers pressed the lenses into her flesh until they snapped. the segmented lens fragments glint in the tiny pools of blood. she tries to control the hysteria welling up inside her. she eases herself carefully over the side of the bed as the first stubby tentacle is joined by another and another. she moves a fraction of an inch at a time, almost hypnotized by the movement of the tentacles. the hooks of the tentacles are now set into tudor's chin and cheeks, and the tentacles draw taut as something attempts to draw itself out of his body. his throat bulges, his cheeks swell as the tentacles contract. his lips are gradually forced apart as the quivering, moist shape emerges. his mouth is opened to jaw breaking width as the creature slowly exposes itself to the dim light of the bedroom. janine's eyes are wide with terror. she utters a gurgling cry and runs, stumbling, from the bedroom. she dashes through the living room and reaches the door to the hallway, whimpering in terror as she fumbles at the lock and the doorknob, finally managing to swing the door open.}
