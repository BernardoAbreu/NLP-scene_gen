<T>__{dissolve to:}
<B>__{closeup jackie}
<A>__{sitting in a chair facing the two offscreen detectives. jackie lights up a cigarette. we don't leave the closeup until noted.}
<L>__{interior dargus office day}
<C>__{dargus }
<D>__{hey, this is my office. there's no smoking.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{arrest me.}
<A>__{nicolet laughs o.s.}
<C>__{dargus }
<D>__{we could, smart ass... or we could work out what's known as a substantial assistance agreement. that is if you're willing to cooperate. tell us who gave you the money and who you're giving it to.}
<A>__{jackie doesn't sat anything... she just smokes.}
<C>__{nicolet }
<D>__{you got a good lawyer?}
<C>__{dargus }
<D>__{can she afford a good one is the question. otherwise she'll be in sybill brand three weeks easy before the public defender gets around to her.}
<C>__{nicolet }
<D>__{ever heard of a fella named beaumont livingston?}
<A>__{not a word.}
<D>__{nicolet (o.s.) (cont'd) don't know beaumont? that's funny 'cause beaumont knows you. well he did know you, beaumont was found in the trunk of a car dead. shot twice. once in the head and once in the chest.}
<A>__{jackie, she puts the "ool" in "cool."}
<D>__{nicolet (o.s.) (cont'd) i had the chance to talk to beaumont yesterday. you see, like you, beaumont found himself in some hot water. he was looking at ten years he was pretty sure he didn't want to do and was understandably concerned. now maybe you don't know beaumont, but beaumont knew you, and maybe so does the guy who blew beaumont's head off.}
<A>__{not a word.}
<C>__{dargus }
<D>__{if you don't want to talk to us, i guess we'll just have to hand you over to customs.}
<A>__{jackie puts out her cigarette.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{okay, let's go.}
<A>__{she stares down the cops.}
<B>__{dargus and nicolet}
<A>__{we cut to the detective and the special agent for the first time in the scene.}
<C>__{dargus}
<D>__{you know, miss brown, there's basically three types of people that we come along in the performance of our duty. one is, innocent people. victims, witnesses, innocent bystanders... you ain't any of these. then there's two; criminals. these sonabitches have dedicated their lives to a life outside the law. that ain't you either. where you belong is the third category. the category we refer to as losers.}
<A>__{jackie's eyes don't even narrow at the insult. she just says without expression;}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i'm not a loser.}
<C>__{dargus}
<D>__{oh, you're both? in 1985 you were flying for twa and got busted for carrying drugs. you were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours. he did time and you got off. but that ended your career with the big airlines. cut to thirteen years later. you're forty four years of age. you're flying for the shittiest little shuttle fucking piece of shit mexican airline that there is. where you make a whopping twelve thousand dollars a year. that ain't a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career. and to top it off, you're going to jail. now true, the judge, even with your prior, will probably only give you a year or two. but this doesn't seem like the time of life you got years to throw away.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{now, we don't like trying losers like they're criminals. but in the absence of a criminal, we will try you. now, wasn't this money given to you by an american living in mexico by the name of cedric walker?}
<A>__{jackie remains unmoved by this monologue. nicolet joins back in.}
<C>__{nicolet}
<D>__{you know, ol' beaumont wasn't much for talkin', either. yeah, he told us about you and mr. walker, but whoever the hell it was he worked for out here, he wouldn't say. could it be the same person you were supposed to deliver this money to?}
<A>__{jackie just stares at them, saying nothing. dargus sits behind his desk, with jackie's flight bag on it.}
<C>__{dargus}
<D>__{i'd like your permission to open this again. so we'll know exactly how much money we're talkin' about here.}
<A>__{jackie gets up from her chair, walks over to the desk, unzips the bag, takes out the manila envelope and drops it on the desk.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{help yourself.}
<C>__{dargus}
<D>__{while you're at it, let me see what else is in there. you mind?}
<A>__{she reaches in the bag and brings out a pocketbook.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{my pocketbook.}
<C>__{dargus}
<D>__{what's in it?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{beauty products.}
<A>__{nicolet takes the manila envelope.}
<C>__{nicolet}
<D>__{i will count the money.}
<A>__{dargus points at a clear plastic bag with pills and packets in it.}
<C>__{dargus}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{that's my diet shit.}
<A>__{nicolet takes out the bills from the envelope.}
<C>__{dargus}
<D>__{let's see what else is in there.}
<A>__{nicolet takes the bills and looks inside the envelope. his expression changes to a shit eating grin.}
<C>__{nicolet}
<D>__{oh, miss brown?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{yeah?}
<A>__{nicolet pulls out a clear cellophane sandwich bag with a half inch or so of white powder inside.}
<C>__{nicolet}
<D>__{and what would this be, sweet and low?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{what the fuck is that shit?}
<C>__{nicolet}
<D>__{i know what it looks like.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you planted that shit on me.}
<A>__{nicolet and dargus laugh at that.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{look, that shit ain't mine.}
<C>__{nicolet}
<P>__{(to dargus)}
<D>__{it isn't enough for trafficking, but how 'bout posession with the intent to distribute?}
<C>__{dargus}
<D>__{oh, i wouldn't be so sure. what with all the cash, i think i could go with conspiracy to traffic.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i'm tellin' you, i don't know nothin' about that fuckin' shit.}
<C>__{nicolet}
<D>__{well then, miss brown. why don't you have a seat and tell us who might know something about this fuckin' shit.}
<A>__{jackie just looks at the two grinning cheshire cats as the balance of power rolls over on her.}
