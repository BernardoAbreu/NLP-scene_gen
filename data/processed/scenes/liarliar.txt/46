<A>__{fletcher pulls over. a police officer strolls up.}
<C>__{police officer}
<D>__{do you know why i stopped you?}

<D>__{depends on how long you were following me.}
<C>__{police officer}
<D>__{why don't we take it from the top.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<P>__{(in agony)}
<D>__{here goes i didn't fasten my seatbelt, i didn't glance in my rearview mirror, i didn't signal when i pulled away from the curb, i sped, i followed too closely, i ran a stop sign, i almost hit :a chevy camaro, i almost hit a ge ezer, i sped some more, i failed to yield at a crosswalk, i changed lanes in the intersection, i changed lanes without signalling, and i changed lanes in the intersection without signalling while running a red light and speeding.}
<A>__{a long moment.}
<C>__{police officer}
<D>__{may i see your driver's license?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{police officer}
<D>__{and why is that?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{it's in my other pants.}
<C>__{police officer}
<D>__{i see. and where are your other pants?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{hanging from my boss's credenza.}
<C>__{police officer}
<D>__{do you expect me to believe that?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{police officer}
<D>__{do you think i'm an idiot?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{yes but that's beside the point! my license actually is in my other pants, and they actually were hanging from a credenzaj i wouldn't lie to you! i mean, i would if i could, but i can't!}
<C>__{police officer}
<D>__{i see. so you ..have no reason to try and hide your license from me?}
