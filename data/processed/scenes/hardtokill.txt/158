<D>__{let's see ... where could that bad boy be?}
<A>__{from the tragic violent rage to what almost seems like a kiddie game, we are not sure if: storm has gone mad or what. he approaches the master closet as he continues the taunting melody.}
<B>__{master closet}
<A>__{storm enters and begins pushing the clothes of the racks aside looking for something that's probably not there. trent is too smart for this shit ... he's probably on a jet to the bahamas by now. one more rack of clothes in the farthest back section. storm reaches to shove it aside when, with shocking and deafening suddenness: a shotgun blast erupts point blank ... shredding $10,000 worth of suit jackets and barely missing storm's head. instantly a figure leaps out. storm gently disarms him, and the two men are for a moment frozen eye to eye.}
<B>__{storm and trent}
<A>__{storm seems to drift off somewhere far away, and then violently slams trent up against the wall, pinning his chest with the left hand. storm takes the sawed off shotgun by the handle and punches the barrel straight into trent's mouth. the barrel simply goes through the teeth and in his mouth. it appears storm has made up his mind about what to do. trent's eyes bug out of his head. storm now takes trent by the hair and leads him through the house, shotgun still in his mouth.}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{you know, trent, i want to kill you so bad i can barely contain myself. but i keep thinking that death is far too merciful a fate for you, and that a nice petite white bread boy like you in a federal penitentiary ...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{ let me put it this way i doubt whether you could remain anal retentive for very long. yeah... i think that's best for you }
<A>__{trent is now so fucking scared he looks like he is about to go out of his mind. about this time in their journey through the house, storm has stopped before holland's mangled and lifeless body. if you think trent was scared before, you should see him now. storm curiously turns his back on trent for a moment, to pick up handcuffs off the floor. trent sees his last chance. trent seizes the poker and does his most mighty babe ruth impression. just as storm stands up, the poker comes flying. it looks like storm is dead but somehow he steps inside the arc and does shihonage, which disarms trent and flips him backwards head first into the fire. trent's neck is impaled by one of the decorative iron arrows of the fireplace. he is stuck struggling to free himself from the arrow as his head catches fire ... a fate somewhat worse than prison. storm turns away }
