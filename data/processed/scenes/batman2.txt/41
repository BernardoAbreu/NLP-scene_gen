<L>__{interior pub in the park night}
<A>__{bruce and vicki emerge from the restaurant. he hands his parking stub to a valet. a crowd's beginning to form in the lot outside... the red and blue bubble of a police car is flashing a short distance off, near the entrance to the park. two red berets, in full order of the bat regalia, look on as a recently mugged woman jogger gives her statement to the investigating cops. bruce and vicki, intrigued by the batman wannabes, move a little closer within eavesdropping range:}
<C>__{red beret i}
<D>__{we were on patrol. saw the whole thing.}
<C>__{jogger}
<D>__{i was attacked. three men in ski masks }
<C>__{cop i}
<P>__{(indicating the red berets)}
<D>__{and these two broke it up?}
<C>__{jogger}
<D>__{these two?? they ran like rabbits. i never saw anybody take off so }
<C>__{red beret ii}
<D>__{hey! somebody had to go for the cops.}
<C>__{cop ii}
<D>__{you. shut up, all right??}
<P>__{(to the jogger)}
<D>__{lady, who was it that bailed you out??}
<C>__{jogger}
<D>__{a kid. thirteen or fourteen tops. he just came out of nowhere and tore into 'em.}
<P>__{(shaking her head)}
<D>__{it was so quick i didn't even see his face.}
<A>__{nearby, vicki shoots a highly quizzical look at bruce, who responds with a mystified shrug. her professional curiosity piqued, she wanders over to introduce herself to the jogger. an exasperated cop leads the red berets away from the crime site:}
<C>__{red beret i}
<D>__{dumb shit. shouldn'ta been jogging in the park at night anyway.}
<P>__{(sullenly)}
<D>__{look around you. it's fulla bums.}
<A>__{bruce gestures at the red beret's batman sweatshirt as he passes.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{nice outfit.}
<C>__{red beret i}
<D>__{piss off, geek.}
