<L>__{interior bar morning}
<A>__{back at his old stomping ground, mark sits at the bar by himself drinking coffee and watching the tv. greg sits next to him, with two boxes of cookies and a liter of coke in front of him. different newspapers are spread out on the bar, all of them with similar headlines, "world rocked by new healthy products", "people everywhere line up for guilt free treats", "you can eat cake all the time!". angle on tv: a fat man is being interviewed in front of a super market, he holds a bag full of junk food in front of him.}
<C>__{fat man}
<D>__{thank the man in the sky for this. i've never been happier in my life. now i can eat whatever i want, whenever i want.}
<A>__{the man takes a bite of a twinkie and wavers a bit like he's going to pass out.}
<C>__{reporter}
<D>__{are you all right, sir?}
<A>__{the man steadies himself.}
<C>__{fat man}
<D>__{yeah. i must just be real happy. it says on the wrapper that they help boost your happiness.}
<A>__{the man smiles, but he's obviously not feeling well.}
<B>__{back on mark}
<A>__{he's watching the tv with a bit of worry on his face. he turns to greg who is eating a stack of cookies and washing it down by gulping from a liter of coke.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you should slow down there, greg.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{why's that?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{just because the package says it's not bad for you doesn't mean you have to gorge yourself on it.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{but it tastes so good.}
<A>__{greg shoves three more cookies into his mouth.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{that's just stupid.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{no it's not.}
<A>__{greg holds up the package of cookies and points to the disclaimer which reads, "these cookies make you smarter".}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{see?}
<A>__{mark sighs.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{you look sad. here, have a brownie. they'll cheer you up.}
<A>__{greg hands mark a brownie that, sure enough, says "they'll cheer you up!" right on the package.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i wish that worked for me, greg.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{nevermind. i will see you around.}
<A>__{mark gets up and leaves.}
