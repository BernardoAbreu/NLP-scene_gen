<L>__{interior corridors labyrinth}
<A>__{julia and malahide are seen in the corridors of the labyrinth. malahide's face is full of delight. he is absolutely the enchanted visitor. julia, on the other hand, walks with the brisk assurance of one on familiar territory. the corridors that malahide sees are different to kirsty's; they are grotto like, dotted with stalactites and stalagmites and not immediately unattractive. the walls contain portals of a glass like substance at random intervals that emit blooming lights of different colors and malahide peers eagerly into several of these. in one, the view is like an aquarium. an alien fish swims past his eyes. its body resembles a human brain but it has pincer like claws. malahide presses his hand against the glass as the thing comes nearer. suddenly, from within its body, the thing produces a perfect human forearm and hand and meets malahide's hand on the other side of the glass. malahide starts slightly but then keeps his hand there. he is turning his head to call julia's attention to this marvel when the thing suddenly forms a fist and begins to beat against the glass with tremendous force. malahide jumps back sharply, but the thing shatters the glass and leaps out at him. he gasps and runs up the corridor, the thing hopping after him on its one hand. as they pass julia, she tuts with the slightly exasperated but indulgent tone of a parent or a teacher. she steps on the thing, squashing it flat. it emits a horrible death cry.}
