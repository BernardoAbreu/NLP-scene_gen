<L>__{exterior road day}
<A>__{solomon is running flat out along the road. running as though his life depended on getting to his destination in beyond a timely manner.}
<L>__{exterior shaw's house day}
<A>__{still running, slick with sweat, solomon comes upon the}
<B>__{shaw house.}
<A>__{as solomon arrives:}
<C>__{master shaw}
<D>__{platt epps, good sunday morning.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{good morning, master shaw. i've been sent by master to retrieve patsey. may i approach?}
<C>__{master shaw}
<D>__{you may.}
<A>__{solomon makes his way over to the piazza.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{excuse me, mistress shaw.}
<C>__{mistress shaw}
<D>__{nigger platt.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{my apologies. patsey, master wishes you to return.}
<C>__{patsey}
<D>__{sabbath day. i's free ta roam.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{understood. but the master sent me running to fetch you, and said no time should be wasted.}
<C>__{mistress shaw}
<D>__{drink tea?}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{thank you, mistress, but i don't dare.}
<C>__{mistress shaw}
<D>__{would you knowed massa epps's consternation ta be any lessened wit your timely return? sit. sit and drink the tea that offered.}
<A>__{solomon knows better, but he sits and the mistress has tea poured for him.}
<C>__{mistress shaw }
<D>__{what'n was epps's concern?}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{...i'd rather not say...}
<C>__{mistress shaw}
<D>__{l'il gossip on the sabbath be fine. all things in moderation.}
<A>__{solomon is not sure what to say. he struggles to be as diplomatic as possible.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{as you are aware, master epps can be a man of a hard countenance. there are times when it is impossible to account for his logic. you know he has ill feelings toward your husband.}
<C>__{mistress shaw}
<D>__{he do.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{master epps has somehow come to believe, as incorrectly as it may be, that master shaw is... that he is something of a lothario and an unprincipled man. a misguided belief born out of their mutual competition as planters, no doubt.}
<C>__{mistress shaw}
<D>__{no doubt...if not born outta truth itself.}
<A>__{the mistress waves to shaw. shaw, unsuspecting of the conversation, waves back.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{i'm certain patsey's well being is master epps's only concern.}
<C>__{mistress shaw}
<D>__{nothin' epps desire come outta concern.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{i meant no disrespect.}
<C>__{mistress shaw}
<D>__{he ain't heard you.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{i meant no disrespect to you, mistress.}
<C>__{mistress shaw}
<D>__{ha! you worry for me? got no cause to worry for my sensibilities. i ain't felt the end of a lash in 'mo years than i cain recall. ain't worked a field, neither. where one time i served, now i got others servin' me. the cost to my current existence be massa shaw broadcasting his affections, 'n me enjoyin' his pantomime of fidelity. if that what keep me from the cotton pickin' niggers, that what it be. a small and reasonable price to be paid 'fo sure.}
<A>__{looking toward patsey, speaking with great empathy:}
<P>__{mistress shaw (contâ€™d)}
<D>__{i knowed what it like to be the object of massa's predilections and peculiarities. and i knowed they can get expressed with kindness or wit violence. a lusty visit in the night, or a visitation from the whip. and wit my experience, if'n i can give comfort, then comfort i give. and you take comfort, patsey; the good lord will manage epps. in his own time the good lord will manage dem all. yes, lordy, there's a day comin' that will burn as an oven. it comin' as sure as the lord is just. when his will be done...the curse on the pharos is a poor example of all that wait 'fo the plantation class.}
<A>__{mistress shaw turns her head to the side, catching a slave's attention. as she does so, the slave, a young woman, commences to pour tea. as if to punctuate her thought, the mistress takes a sip of her tea.}
