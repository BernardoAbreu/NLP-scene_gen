<L>__{exterior plaszow day}
<A>__{a dead chicken dangling from hujar's hand, evidence of some kind. goeth slowly pacing before a work detail of twenty or so men standing still, silent, in a row.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{nobody knows who stole the chicken. a man walks around with a chicken, nobody notices this.}
<A>__{no one confesses. goeth nods, all right, takes a rifle from a guard and shoots one of the workers at random. with this added incentive, he waits for someone to tell him who stole the chicken. no one does.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{still nobody knows.}
<A>__{he shrugs, okay, points the rifle at another worker and a boy of fourteen, shuddering and weeping, steps out of line.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{there we go.}
<A>__{goeth goes over to the boy, and, like a distant relative to a small child, tries to get him to look at his face.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{it was you? you committed this crime?}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{you know who, though.}
<A>__{the boy nods, weeps, screams }
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{him!}
<A>__{he's pointing at the dead man. and goeth astonishes the entire assembly of workers and guards by believing the boy. he returns the rifle to the guard and walks away. hujar stares after him, then knowingly at the boy.}
