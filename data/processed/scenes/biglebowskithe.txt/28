<D>__{get out of that fucking car, man!}
<A>__{the man nervously complies. the dude flinches at the man's movement as he gets out. the man cringes, reacting to the dude's flinch. he is wearing a cheap blue serge suit. he is bald with a short fringe and a mustache. the dude shouts to cover his fear:}

<A>__{the dude steps out to meet walter's car as it pulls up, its passenger window open and the pomeranian leaning out and yapping. denny's four people sit at a booth: dieter, kieffer, franz, all in black leather, and a young woman with long stringy blonde hair, wearing torn and patched jeans and a ribbed sleeveless tee shirt, worn thin with age. she is apparently braless, and is teutonically pale with birthmarks on her face and arms. notable is her camera side leg, which ends in a bandage swaddled foot. dried rust colored blood stains the tip of the bandage. the four are arguing, loudly, in german. they seem very unhappy. a waitress enters with a checkpad and pen.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{you folks ready?}

<C>__{dude}
<D>__{i mean we totally fucked it up, man. we fucked up his pay off. and got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything. huh?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{i'm saying if he knows i'm a fuck up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? because he fucking doesn't want her back, man! he's had enough! he no longer digs her! it's all a show! but then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks? i mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{what's your point, dude?}
