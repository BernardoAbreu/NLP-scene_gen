<L>__{interior freak house morning}
<A>__{rick awakens with a start and gets up. he approaches julieernie, the bearded lady, nosey and dog boy, who are idly playing a game of "wheel of fortune." the cubicles contain large blank blocks, like the "letters" on the game show. so far, there's a "d", two "s"s, and a "k" revealed. rosie the pinhead plays vanna white's role.}
<C>__{nosey}
<D>__{i'd like to buy a vowel.}
<A>__{the bearded lady yawns. rick edges towards them.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{hey. the wheel. mind if i sit in?}
<A>__{juan advances towards rick, sneering.}
<C>__{juan}
<D>__{so. now you don't mind mixing with us how did you say it sorry mutants?}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{look! i'm sorry for what happened at the show. can't you just forget it?}
<A>__{he shakes his finger at juan, and notices there's still a human nose stuck on his monster claw. he wipes it off, embarrassed. there's an awkward pause. ernie breaks the silence.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{hey, shouldn't you tell rick about your big escape plan?}
<A>__{juan gives ernie a nasty "shut up" look. he growls at him.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{well, excuse me for living.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{you have an escape plan?}
<C>__{juan}
<D>__{listen, beast boy, the games are a simple diversion.}
<C>__{juan}
<D>__{beneath our twisted flesh we freaks cry out for freedom! aooooooorrraaaagh!}
<A>__{juan howls lustily. he looks to rest of the freaks. they're a pathetic lot, and their half hearted howl proves it.}
<C>__{freaks}
<D>__{aoo...}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{juan's plan is really ingenious rick. see, he figured out that }
<C>__{juan}
<D>__{i figured out that our escape does not include the beast boy. no one may discuss the plan with him, understand?}
<A>__{juan gives the others a threatening look. they mumble agreement.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{what's the matter with all of you? you trust your lives to a guy just 'cause he can lick his own privates?}
<A>__{the freaks ponder this a second, then nod "yes".}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{you gotta admit, coog, it's a helluva trick.}
<C>__{rick}
<P>__{(resentful)}
<D>__{fine! i will just come up with an escape plan of my own then.}
<C>__{juan}
<D>__{haha! i have spent a year studying this hellhole, devising the perfect escape. you think you'll just tango right out the door!? ha! just try it, amigo.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{i will!}
<A>__{rick turns to go. julieernie rush over and try to reason with him quietly.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{rick, wait.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{yeah. don't go off half cocked. believe me, it ain't all it's cracked up to be.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{this isn't one of your dumb movies, coogan. look, juan's a good dog, a smart dog. i will talk to him. don't be stupid, rick. you can't do it without us.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{forget it! i don't need you, ees, or anybody else! i will get out of here all by myself, you... you.,. crud sucking pus monkeys!}
<A>__{ding ding ding! the letters in the wheel of fortune board light up, and rosie turns them over to reveal "crud sucking pus monkeys" as the secret phrase. everyone claps despite themselves. juan stares them down. they stop. rick storms off in a huff. juan takes julie's hand and gazes deep into her eyes. he kisses her passionately. julie is watching rick leave. juan nibbles her neck, which gets her attention. she scratches juan behind his ear. his leg instinctively kicks the air. ernie looks worried.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{i'm getting a bad feeling here.}
