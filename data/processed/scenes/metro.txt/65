<L>__{interior conference room day}
<A>__{roper and mccall are sitting in the dark watching a video tape. it's grainy footage of a hostage situation in a sporting goods store. a negotiator confronted with a gunman holding a ten year old girl hostage. the negotiator holds his hands out imploringly... carefully moves toward the gunman. the negotiator exchanges himself for the little girl. the gunman grabs the negotiator around the neck, holds the gun to his head. the little girl runs out of the picture to safety. roper remains dead silent during all this. mccall looks over at him. the blue light flickers over roper's motionless face.}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{was that your partner?}
<A>__{roper nods.}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{why did he do it?}
<C>__{roper}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{because he knew the little girl had zero chance of survival and his chances would be a little better... we had a plan, but swat opened up too early. he got caught in the crossfire.}
<P>__{(a sad beat)}
<D>__{let's move on... notice this. always use the eyes to keep the connection. it almost like hypnosis. that's the most important thing. create a connection. you're always on their side...}
<A>__{mccall watches him for a beat, then turns his attention back on the screen.}
