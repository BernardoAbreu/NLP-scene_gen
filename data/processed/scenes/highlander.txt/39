<L>__{1967.}
<A>__{brenna looks down the list to a william taupin of felton, delaware, who stopped filling for driver permits in 1967, the year richard started.}
<L>__{exterior gas station day}
<A>__{dropping a couple of quarters into a vending machine, brenna removes and opens up a map of the state of delaware.}
<L>__{exterior graveyard day}
<A>__{brenna steps out of her car at a small town cemetary. holding a slip of paper, she weaves her way through the shade covered tombs of revolutionary heroes and their descendants. on a small rise fresh dirt lies in careless piles around an open grave. richard taupin stands at the mouth of the pit. a coffin has been brutally pulled from the dirt and lies open and propped diagonally beside a marker that reads: "william michael taupin". the casket is empty.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{someone beat you.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, miss cartwright?}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{grave robbers?}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{probably.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{people like that rarely leave business cards.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{does carl smith?}
<A>__{a flash of interest, quickly suppressed.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{i don't know what you're talking about.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{i think you do. better yet, i don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. and i think mr. smith, whoever he is, now knows that.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{you have an active imagination.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{i've been to church hill.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{miss cartwright, you are involving yourself in matters that do not concern you. i strongly suggest you return to washington and stay out of small town cemetaries.}
<A>__{he starts for the gate.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{i could find him.}
<A>__{taupin stops.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{i have friends.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{i doubt that.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{good day, miss cartwright.}
<A>__{he walks on. after only a few paces taupin suddenly shudders to an abrupt stop.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<A>__{he holds up an open palm to silence her.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{your help may be unneccessary.}
<A>__{the air is still. taupin's face is expressionless. he listens intently. sensing. an unseen voice rides seemingly on the wind.}
<C>__{voice}
<P>__{(o.s.)}
<D>__{good afternoon, "mr. taupin".}
<A>__{taupin whirls around to see a large man standing with broad sword in hand. we have never seen the knight out of his armor before, but this man certainly seems to fit the bill. wearing levis and leather jacket in contrast to taupin's expensive business suit, he speaks with icy evenness from a face of stone. taupin, naked without his own sword, is trapped against a marble wall.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{long time.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{not so long.}
<A>__{the knight is closing in on him, sword gripped in both hands.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{you've been here from the start.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{my quarry grows clever with age. and the others, incompetent.}
<A>__{the knight throws brenna a glance.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{friend of yours?}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{of sorts.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{i do hope she enjoys a good show.}
<A>__{the knight leans his whole body into a two fisted swing, clanging out a chunk of marble as taupin ducks. a second swipe also imbeds itself in stone.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{so now it ends.}
<A>__{a thrust cuts only air.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{generation upon generation. tens of thousands of miles.}
<A>__{taupin leaps behind a tree. the knight cuts it nearly in half.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{you're the last, macleod. romirez, lacroux, neuvich, those fools that followed me, their heads all line my shelf. all but yours.}
<A>__{taupin drops to the ground in a shoulder roll to avoid a swipe.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{can you feel it, macleod? can you _feel_ it!}
<A>__{taupin grabs a tree branch and raps the knight on the knee, knocking him over. the knight quickly rights himself and cuts the branch from taupin.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{there can be but one.}
<A>__{he raises his blade. an elderly watchman, shotgun cradled in his arms, stands in the clearing.}
<C>__{watchman}
<D>__{hey! what's going on here?}
<A>__{the knight pauses a split second then with decision launches his sword spear style firmly into the watchman's chest. taupin pushes past him to brenna.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{run!}
<A>__{brenna is frozen in shock. taupin shoves her roughly toward the gate.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{run!}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{macleod!}
<A>__{the knight retrieves his sword from the watchman's body and lumbers after them. taupin and brenna bolt from the cemetary and into the surround ing residential area.}
