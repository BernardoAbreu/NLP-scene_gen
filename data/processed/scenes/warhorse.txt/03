<A>__{the farmers lead joey and his mother through the chaos of the market and into an auction pen. they find themselves amongst a hoard of pigs, sheep and cows. joey is agog at all of these creatures and all this life he had no idea existed. the farmers lead the horses into a stall to await the auction. joey is bewildered by all the noise buttressed against a couple of mules and a cow. he is uncomfortable in this tight space. an auction worker holds a clipboard out for the lead farmer.}
