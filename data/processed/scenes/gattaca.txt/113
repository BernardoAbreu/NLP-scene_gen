<L>__{interior gattaca corporation corridor. day.}
<A>__{a line of male gattaca employees snakes out the door and down the corridor. the investigator walks slowly down the line, trying to eyeball his suspect. concentrating on the shorter, dark haired men in the line, he looks straight past jerome. however, as the investigator ignores him and walks by, we see a haunted look in jerome's eyes.}
<L>__{interior gattaca testing lab. day.}
<A>__{every available technician is working to accommodate the testing of the thousand or so programmers. twelve testing stations operate simultaneously. a homicide detective supervises each station. jerome reaches the head of the line. he notes an exiting colleague holding a cotton ball to his arm. a nurse directs jerome to lamar's testing station. lamar deposits the previous patient's labeled vial into a blood carousel under the watchful eye of a large detective, clearly not relishing his assignment. jerome rolls up his sleeve.}
<C>__{jerome}
<P>__{(referring to the table lined with syringes)}
<D>__{what's with the plungers, lamar? what are you doing, opening a blood bank?}
<A>__{the syringes are clearly not lamar's idea.}
<C>__{lamar}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{the gentlemen of law enforcement are concerned that my testing methods may have been compromised.}
<A>__{lamar inserts a fresh syringe into jerome's arm. as lamar draws the blood, jerome suddenly flinches and flexes his arm violently, causing the needle to bend and buckle, exiting the skin from a second puncture pointerior}
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{damn!!}
<A>__{having pulled away from lamar's grasp, jerome withdraws the bent needle himself, blood still squirting from his vein.}
<C>__{lamar}
<P>__{(grabbing a nearby wad of gauze)}
<D>__{jesus i'm sorry, jerome.}
<A>__{the large homicide detective winces and turns away from the red arcing spray, a splash of blood spattering his shoes. in the midst of the commotion, with his practised sleight of hand, jerome removes the vial from the syringe and replaces it with another concealed vial.}
<C>__{jerome}
<P>__{(unfazed, putting lamar at his ease)}
<D>__{you must be out of practise, lamar.}
<A>__{lamar hurriedly takes the syringe from jerome.}
<C>__{lamar}
<P>__{(examining and removing the switched vial from the bent syringe)}
<D>__{i've got enough here.}
<C>__{jerome}
<P>__{(regarding the squimish detective, as he holds the gauze to his arm)}
<D>__{need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.}
<A>__{the detective notices the spatter of blood across his brogues and, with a look of disdain, wipes it clean. he tosses the incriminating tissue down a hygenically sealed garbage shoot. lamar places jerome's labelled vial in the carousel where it is immediately analyzed by the computer. jerome's "legitimate" employee id code appears on the screen "valid" . another employee enters the testing lab.}
