<A>__{bb and moe at the camera and tripod.}
<C>__{bb}
<P>__{(under his breath, to moe)}
<D>__{she's at the window.}
<C>__{moe}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{bb}
<P>__{(in a loud voice)}
<D>__{this is going to be terrific in life magazine.}
<P>__{(even louder)}
<D>__{terrific in life magazine!}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{come on outside, honey.}
<C>__{moe}
<P>__{(in loud voice)}
<D>__{this should be our single biggest issue of life magazine.}
<A>__{we see the housewife coming out of her front door.}
<C>__{bb}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{bingo!}
<A>__{the housewife approaches bb and moe suspiciously.}
<C>__{housewife}
<D>__{excuse me. what are you doing?}
<C>__{moe}
<D>__{oh, i hope we're not disturbing you, ma'am. we're with life magazine... we'll be out of here in just a minute.}
<C>__{bb}
<P>__{(still looking through camera; to moe)}
<D>__{move the tripod another foot... another foot.}
<A>__{moe moves the tripod.}
<C>__{housewife}
<D>__{what do you mean, life magazine?}
<C>__{bb}
<P>__{(looking up from camera)}
<D>__{two minutes, ma'am, and we'll be out of here. we just need the picture for life magazine, and we'll be out of here.}
<C>__{housewife}
<D>__{life magazine? i don't understand.}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{it's very simple. ya know, we're doing this layout about the benefits of aluminum siding a 'before' and 'after' kind of presentation.}
<C>__{housewife}
<D>__{a 'before' picture?}
<C>__{moe}
<D>__{so they see your house, and another one done with aluminum siding... the other house looking so much more beautiful.}
<C>__{housewife}
<D>__{in life magazine?}
<C>__{moe}
<D>__{it's a special issue on home improvements and ways to beautify your home.}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{a wonderful issue... it's one of the finest pictorial things we've done here at life... the ways you can improve your house.}
<P>__{(he adjusts the camera)}
<D>__{we're gonna be out of here in no time, ma'am.}
<C>__{moe}
<D>__{it's gonna look very good, bb.}
<C>__{housewife}
<D>__{my house is going to be the 'before'? can't mine be like the 'after'?}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{no, no... we've got a house that looked like yours and it's been done in aluminum... it's very nice.}
<C>__{moe}
<D>__{yeah... really shows the contrast of what a house can look like.}
<C>__{housewife}
<D>__{what does it cost?}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{what? the aluminum siding? oh... i don't know the figures offhand. do you have any idea, moe?}
<C>__{moe}
<D>__{i think it's fairly reasonable.}
<C>__{housewife}
<D>__{could my house be the 'after' in life magazine and you get another house for the 'before.'}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{you mean have your house as the 'after' and find another house that looks like your house for the 'before'?}
<C>__{housewife}
<D>__{is it possible?}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{what do ya think, moe? would that be ethical?}
<C>__{moe}
<D>__{well, we didn't sign any agreement with the 'after' house. we'd have to move very quickly, ma'am... you know what i mean?}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{you'd have to work out an arrangement with an aluminum siding company and they'd have to do the job very quickly for us to make our deadline... we've got a deadline, that's the problem.}
<C>__{housewife}
<D>__{how quickly?}
<C>__{moe}
<D>__{bb, what do you think? can we slide the deadline, or what? six or seven days?}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{pressing it. do you think we could manage it, moe?}
<C>__{moe}
<D>__{it's pushing it, bb.}
<P>__{(to housewife)}
<D>__{what time would your husband be home, 'cos he'd have to go over the figures with the salesman... that's if there's a salesman available this evening.}
<C>__{housewife}
<D>__{he'll be home at seven.}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{we might be able to work it.}
<C>__{housewife}
<D>__{that would be wonderful.}
