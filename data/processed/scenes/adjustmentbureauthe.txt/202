<L>__{exterior red hook docks night}
<A>__{david sits under the huge aluminum roof on one of the piers, holding a bottle of beer in a soaked paper bag. there are no walls to this structure so rainwater pours off the roof on all four sides forming virtual walls. a figure in a suit approaches david from behind. he turns to see the man.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{why are you here?}
<A>__{reverse to reveal harry, in a suit and raincoat.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i would have come earlier but i had to wait for the rain.}
<P>__{(off david's confusion)}
<D>__{water interferes with their ability to sense your decision tree. that's why we met on a boat last time.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i guess i'm here to set the record straight.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{about what? harry thompson was lying when he said they couldn't let you be with elise because it would bring out your reckless side.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{why, then? why do they care so much?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{because... she's enough, david. if you have her you might not need to fill the void inside you with votes and applause and dreams of one day becoming president...}
<A>__{it's harry has looked straight into david's soul.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i've watched you a long time. they're right to want you in the white house. it would be good for the world. that's important but it can't be the only thing that matters.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{why are you so different than they are?}
<A>__{a long beat, then:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you know, your dad was a smart man. he could have been a lot more and he wanted to be. so did your brother. but the plan didn't call for that.}
<A>__{this hits david hard.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{in my job, you implement the plan...}
<P>__{(emotional)}
<D>__{and most of the time.. .you don't even know why...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm sorry...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{my mom?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{that wasn't me... that wasn't us at all.}
<A>__{david takes all this in. after a long beat he takes a drink. then he offers the bottle to harry, who hesitates, then takes a drink as well.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{when thompson told me the choice as elise or the white house i barely hesitated.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{but the truth is after making that choice i went into a free fall... don't get me wrong, it killed me to see thompson hurt her... but i used it as an excuse. i think i left her more to save my career than hers.}
<P>__{(struggling)}
<D>__{thompson wasn't lying. the press is already talking about me as a future president. i'm phoning in my speeches and i'm still sixteen points up in the polls.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{the public loves you.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{before i met elise that was all that mattered. now i hardly notice. she's all i think about.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{do you know where she's getting married?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{front of a judge. tomorrow morning.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{is she happy with him? tell me she is and i will walk away.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{thompson won't let you get near that courthouse.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{harry... is she happy?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i have to get her back..}
<A>__{harry knows how unlikely that is.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{will you help me? just help me get to her...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{they'll sense you coming a mile away.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what if i could move as fast as you can?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{teach me about the doors.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{how do you know about that?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{the first day, after they caught me, they carried me through one.i thought it was a hallucination at first. eventually i realized it's how you move around so fast.}
<P>__{(off harry's reluctance)}
<D>__{if you don't want to help me because of what they'll do to you...okay, that's your choice. but if this is about protecting me then shouldn't the choice be mine?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{do you have any idea how complicated it is to navigate through those doors... how many thousands of permutations there are in even a simple several block journey?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you know, when i do town hall meetings i usually get introduced to forty or fifty people between when i walk, through' the door and when i start speaking. but when i'm done with the speech i can call on each one of them by game.}
<A>__{a beat...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i've seen you do that}
<P>__{(taking the leap )}
<D>__{the rain is supposed to stop in the next hour. we're going to need all night to do this. and we're going to need a place surrounded by water to do it.}
<B>__{moments later}
<A>__{harry and david stand outside a door to a dock office at the end of the pier. harry dons his hat.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{put your hand on my shoulder. and don't let go until we've crossed the threshold. david complies. harry opens the door.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{are they ever locked?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{maybe if you have a defective hat.}
<A>__{they step through the door and onto }
