<L>__{interior moving coach day}
<A>__{anna's hysteria has solidified into a blank despair. karenin seems to want to pretend that nothing important has happened.}
<C>__{karenin}
<D>__{you know . . . they say the emperor dis approves of the races . . . the danger of injury . . . but i . . .}
<A>__{anna looks at him contemptuously.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{karenin}
<D>__{i'm saying there is a value in manly sport, for the military }
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{karenin}
<D>__{in my opinion, it's not the sport itself that's wrong, it's the spectacle, it's making a cruel spectacle out of }
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<A>__{karenin changes tack.}
<C>__{karenin}
<D>__{i have to tell you }
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{karenin}
<D>__{i have to tell you, you behaved improperly today.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{and how was that?}
<A>__{she has raised her voice. he raises a warning finger, and reaches to close the communication window behind the coachman's box.}
<C>__{karenin}
<D>__{by making plain your feelings when one of the riders fell. your conduct was improper. it must not occur again. i have said it before.}
<A>__{anna smiles faintly. he is misled by that.}
<C>__{karenin }
<D>__{you are going to say my concern is unneces sary and ridiculous. you are my wife. i am wrong to think that . . . yes perhaps i was mistaken.}
<A>__{anna looks at him despairingly.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no, you were not mistaken. i love him. i am his mistress. i can't bear you, i'm afraid of you, i hate you. do what you like to me.}
<A>__{karenin is literally winded gasping for breath, slowly getting his breath ing under control. anna huddles away from him in her corner. karenin recovers himself only to the point of sitting stock still, looking at nothing, not moving. the coach lurches, unbalancing him so that he is pushed against anna. he recoils as if from a contamination. the coach slows. the coach stops. a servant comes to the coach door, opens the door.}
<C>__{karenin}
<D>__{wait, please. move away.}
<A>__{the servant backs off.}
<C>__{karenin }
<D>__{i will not have a scandal. therefore . . . you will not see . . . this man again. you will behave in such a way that nothing is known against you, by society or by the servants. in return, you will keep the privileges of a wife and the duties. tomorrow you will return home. that is all.}
<A>__{anna gets out of the coach and runs into the maze.}
