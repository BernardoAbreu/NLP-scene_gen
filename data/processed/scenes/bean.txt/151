<A>__{(about 5 p.m.) bean and david head for the parking lot. on the way, bean's interest is drawn to the mime artist we met before in his clinton mask, performing his heart out in front of the dead cars sculpture. bean lingers. the mime accosts a woman, pretending to brush dust from her clothes, comb her hair etc. the mime is a bit of a pain in the ass really. the woman quickly moves on. bean is intrigued. the mime mimes climbing a ladder. bean goes up next to him and looks up. there's nothing there. he decides the mime is a bit of a tricky. this is confirmed when the mime pretends he's locked behind a pane of glass. bean simply pokes his finger through the imaginary glass wall, and hits the mime's nose.}
