<D>__{bobby, let's relax now. louie may be a fool...}
<A>__{bobby grabs louie by the collar and throws him from the wheelchair. louis lands heavily on his crippled frame, dazed, the bowling ball bag dribbling onto the floor near sinjin. bobby grabs the wheelchair in both hands and begins smashing it against the wall and into the floor. as jimmy and sinjin watch, dumbfounded, the large clay lawn dwarf we saw earlier bursts trough the window and lands in the center of the room. everyone stops to stare at the lawn dwarf, including bobby.}
