<L>__{interior kitchen, black cove farm, easter. day}
<A>__{a girl, about five or six, with ada's curls, sits at the table cradling a tiny lamb, which won't feed from the nippled bottle she offers it. she tries again. ada comes in suddenly, takes a knife from the kitchen, and hurries out.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{you bring that lamb outside.}
<A>__{the girl gets up, carries the lamb out into the field.}
<L>__{exterior field, black cove farm. day}
<A>__{the sound of the fiddle continuing, joined by a banjo, it's a glorious spring morning, black cove farm at its most luxuriant, the path edged with brilliant flowers. there are more animals in evidence. the girl emerges from the house and sees ada in the field, surrounded by sheep. she hurries over. ada is expertly skinning a stillborn lamb. the little girl is horrified.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{what are you doing!}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{he came out dead, love.}
<A>__{she has the skin off the lamb, which lies like a little pink cat on the ground. she approaches grace, takes the live lamb from her arms, the girl resistant, frightened.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{don't kill him!}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{i'm not going to kill him. but we have to try something or else he's going to die.}
<A>__{she takes the skin and wraps it round grace's lamb. then puts the covered lamb into the pen with the dead lamb's mother. it goes to the sheep and, after a few false starts, starts to feed, accepted as a surrogate.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{isn't that a small mercy.}
<A>__{and a voice joins in with the fiddle and banjo.}
