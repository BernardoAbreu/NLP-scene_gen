<DIAL>__{Morning.}
<CHAR>__{ELLEN BLOCK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What was captured on that video is that the aircraft was in a relatively stable glide just prior to the moment of impact. However, according to the data we retrieved from the cockpit data recorders, at exactly 9:34, after flying 27 minutes without incident, the transponder recorded a loss in altitude in excess of 4800 feet per minute in what is considered a "full pitch nose down" attitude. Then at 9:42, according to the data recorders, a decision was made to invert the aircraft. The NTSB has created animated simulation that I would like to play at this point.}
<ACTION>__{ELLEN points to the screen... An NTSB animation shows the plane pitching down and we follow it through the inversion of the plane while listening to the real audio of the flight crew. The animation has a split screen that also shows the instruments and printed text of what's being said. We hear..."What's your son's name?" "Why?" "The black box" "I love you, Trevor. Be a good boy, Mommy loves you." "What are we doing?! Why would I trim down?!" "We're gonna roll it. Ready? Here we go. I've got control." That last statement seems to echo as the presentation stops and the lights come back up. We return to the hearing in progress.}
<CHAR>__{ELLEN BLOCK } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{That audio is tragic and compelling. I chose to play that part of the cockpit recording to highlight a key moment aboard flight 227, wherein you say "We're gonna roll it, here we go, I've got control." You made a very conscious decision to invert the airplane, to roll the plane upside down. Is that correct?}

<ACTION>__{Whip stops. His whole body trembles, his face tightens. He looks right at ELLEN...}
<CHAR>__{WHIP } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{...because I did. I drank the vodka.}
<ACTION>__{The crowd gasps, unsure of what they just heard... CHARLIE rockets out of his chair.}
<CHAR>__{CHARLIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{OBJECTION!!! NTSB OFFICER #2 Please be seated sir. This is not a court room.}
<ACTION>__{Now CHARLIE returns to his chair to find that HUGH is gone. CHARLIE looks around for HUGH, no sign. He's vanished. WHIP leans close to the microphone.}
<CHAR>__{WHIP} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I drank the vodka bottles on the plane.}
<CHAR>__{ELLEN BLOCK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Mr. Whitaker, in light of that remark, would you like to readdress...}
<CHAR>__{WHIP} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You don't have to readdress anything. I DRANK THE VODKA!}
<CHAR>__{ELLEN BLOCK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{On the three nights before the accident, October 11th-}
<CHAR>__{WHIP} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{On October 11th, 12th and 13th and 14th I was intoxicated. I drank alcohol on all of those days. I drank to excess.}
<ACTION>__{Chaos erupts further as REPORTERS outnumber SECURITY. Flash bulbs pop repeatedly and large lights are aimed at the fracas on stage as video is taken of the bizarre melee.}
<CHAR>__{ELLEN BLOCK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Mr. Whitaker, on the morning of OCTOBER-}
<CHAR>__{WHIP} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I was drunk. I'm drunk right now, Miss Block...I'm drunk right...}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(Whip finally breaks down)}
<DIAL>__{I'm drunk now, because... Because I'm an alcoholic.}
<ACTION>__{We have pushed into a tight shot on WHIP's face as the sound in the room fades away. We stay tight on WHIP's face as he lets the moments unfold. Suddenly the noise cuts to silence. WHIP is looking at the assembly. WHIP wipes tears from his eyes. We hear WHIP's voice as the dialogue pre-laps the image of his face.}
<CHAR>__{WHIP } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{That was it...I was done. It's as if I'd hit my life long limit for lies.}
<ACTION>__{A new angle shows WHIP speaking these words...}
<CHAR>__{WHIP} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I could not tell one more lie. And maybe I'm a sucker. Because if I had just told one more lie? I could have walked away from that whole mess and kept my wings and my false sense of pride and most importantly I would have avoided being locked up here with all of you nice folks for the last 13 months.}
<ACTION>__{We hear laughter as we pull out from WHIP to realize that he is in fact wearing a white penal jumpsuit and leading an AA meeting in a Federal Prison.}
<CHAR>__{WHIP } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{It looks like I will serve every day of the remaining 4 plus years of my sentence. And that's fair. I betrayed the public trust. I did. That's what the judge explained to me. I had betrayed the public trust. The FAA took my license. And that's fair. The chances of me flying again are slim to none. And I accept that.}
<LOC>__{INT. MCRAE FEDERAL PENITENTIARY -- GEORGIA -- DAY}
<ACTION>__{A large room houses an AA meeting for about 50 inmates wearing white jumpsuits. WHIP continues his story.}
<CHAR>__{WHIP} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I've had time to think about all of it. Doing a lot of writing. I've written letters to each of the families that lost loved ones on my flight. Some were able to hear my apology, some never will. I've also apologized to all the people who tried to help me along the way, but I couldn't or wouldn't listen, like my wife, I mean my ex wife...}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(he gets emotional)}
<DIAL>__{...and my son. Again, some were able to forgive me...some never will.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(COLLECTS HIMSELF)}
<DIAL>__{But at least I'm sober, and I'm grateful for that.}
<ACTION>__{Whip gives it to us straight...}
<CHAR>__{WHIP } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{And this is gonna sound really stupid coming from a man who's in prison...but for the first time in my life...I'm free.}
<ACTION>__{We hold close on WHIP's face as we hear the metallic clang of prison doors shutting. On the sound we cut to...}
<LOC>__{INT. FEDERAL PENITENTIARY -- CELL -- DAY}
<ACTION>__{We pan across the concrete cell wall, looking at a small, personal photo collage. We see a photo of NICOLE and SHEILA and a few other AA FOLKS surrounding WHIP who sits in front of a birthday cake in the common room of the prison. We see a photo of WHIP's DAD as an airman. We ultimately land on a photo of NICOLE. We recognize it as the photo WHIP took on the porch of the Whitaker Farm. We pan down to find WHIP writing in a journal. A GUARD comes to the front of his cell.}
<CHAR>__{GUARD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Whitaker, you got a visitor.}
<ACTION>__{WHIP looks at the GUARD and nods before taking a last glance at the photo of NICOLE.}
<LOC>__{EXT. FEDERAL PENITENTIARY -- GUEST YARD -- DAY}
<ACTION>__{WHIP sits at a lone picnic table in a fence-enclosed courtyard. He checks his watch and looks up. WHIP stands and walks towards us, towards his visitor. As he gets closer we see a smile break across his face. A smile we haven't seen since he first saw NICOLE. We reverse to see... WILL -- WHIP's 17 year old son stands next to a GUARD.}
<CHAR>__{GUARD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You have 40 minutes.}
<CHAR>__{WHIP} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Knuckles, you're looking good.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(BEAT)}
<DIAL>__{I sent you something for your birthday.}
<CHAR>__{WILL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah. I got it.}
<ACTION>__{Another beat as they can't find a way in to a conversation.}
<CHAR>__{WHIP} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{This is a real surprise; a great surprise. I haven't seen you-}
<ACTION>__{WHIP chokes up. WILL nods. It's intense. WHIP motions to the table and they both sit. WILL pulls out a notebook.}
<CHAR>__{WILL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{College counselor thought I should come and interview you.}
<CHAR>__{WHIP} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Great. An interview. Okay.}
<CHAR>__{WILL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm writing essays for college applications.}
<ACTION>__{WHIP studies him and laughs...WILL nods and tries to smile.}
<CHAR>__{WHIP} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Listen Will, it means everything to me that you came here. You are an amazing kid and you deserve great things...}
<ACTION>__{Again WHIP has to tamp down his emotions.}
<CHAR>__{WILL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{So can you help me with this essay?}
<CHAR>__{WHIP} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah. Of course.}
<ACTION>__{WILL pulls out a small voice recorder and clicks it on...}
<CHAR>__{WILL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{This essay. I have to do an essay called, "the most fascinating person I've never met."}
<ACTION>__{The two men just look at each other.}
<CHAR>__{WHIP} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And that's me?}
<ACTION>__{WILL nods, both men are struggling to keep it together.}
<CHAR>__{WILL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Can we pick up where we left off?}
<ACTION>__{WHIP nods, unsure as to where this is going.}
<CHAR>__{WHIP} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Okay.}
<CHAR>__{WILL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Who are you?}
<CHAR>__{WHIP} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Good question.}
<ACTION>__{WHIP smiles...a great, familiar question. He begins to alternately laugh and sob as there is great relief in the promise of a connection with his son.}
