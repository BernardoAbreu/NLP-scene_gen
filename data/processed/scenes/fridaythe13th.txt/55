<A>__{in the camper van are three young people. they are full of fun, fresh and expectant as they head towards crystal lake. they are instantly likeable. at the wheel is ned, a short 22 year old whose well developed upper body is a tribute to his weight lifting. he is nice looking, a joker who is always trying to get some attraction. he is funny and alert. next to him is jack, an athlete whose clean cut look is as american as popcorn. he is quieter, two years younger and not as smart as ned. he has to think things through. marcie is jack's girlfriend. she is leaning over the front passenger seat so she can messenger jack's shoulders. she is a funny girl, pretty, and always looking for fun. she enjoys every minute of every day. she hasn't been touched by tragedy.}
