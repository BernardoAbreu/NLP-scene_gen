<L>__{exterior roof on catwoman that moment}
<A>__{she's wrapped the handle end of the whip around an exposed pipe on the roof, anchoring batman in place. with a cheshire cat grin, she removes the raven from her knapsack and holds it on the edge of the cornice.}
<L>__{exterior facade that moment}
<A>__{batman hanging immobile. craning his neck, he can just see the raven statuette on the ledge above him bouncing slightly, and apparently talking to him...}
<C>__{catwoman }
<D>__{nevermore. nevermore!}
<A>__{now the catwoman appears beside it elbows on the cornice, chin propped up on her folded hands, like a chatty girl at a fern bar.}
<C>__{catwoman}
<D>__{cute, huh! i think it'll look nice over the fireplace. maybe you can drop by and see it sometime.}
<P>__{(demurely)}
<D>__{i hope you won't think i'm too... aggressive or anything, but i find you very attractive.}
<A>__{she toys aimlessly with the whipcord, batting at it like a cat with a piece of yarn. batman grimaces. she speaks in a low, soothing, seductive tone almost a purr. behind the bondage mask she bats her eyelashes.}
<C>__{catwoman }
<D>__{it's just so hard to meet interesting men these days. don't you think so?}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{i have trouble with relationships. men find me intimidating...kind of predatory, you know? really i'm not. really i'm just playful...}
<A>__{batman huffs and puffs, trying to bend at the waist so he can grab hold of the whip. she frowns and yanks on it. his foot flies free of the wall, and another loop of the whip uncoils before he can stabilize himself.}
<C>__{catwoman }
<D>__{don't laugh! i'm trying to open up to you!}
<A>__{angrily, she holds a steel claw to the whip ready to cut him loose.}
<B>__{angle on batman}
<A>__{he's palmed the grappling hook launcher from his belt. holding it close to his body, out of view, he works it around into firing position. he'll shoot it right through her if he has to...}
<C>__{catwoman }
<D>__{i always seem to fall for the wrong guys. you know...most men are rats.}
<B>__{angle on catwoman}
<A>__{she withdraws her hand from the whip, reverts to her philosphical mode.}
<C>__{catwoman}
<D>__{mice, really. it's disgusting they beg you to walk all over them and then they whine when you do it. once you've had your fun there's not much you can do but kill them.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but you seem different. i mean, you obviously understand about dressing up... that saves a lot of explaining. i think people should indulge their fantasies, don't you?}
<A>__{batman is sweating profusely. he can't hold his position much longer. and the catwoman is dragging this insane flirtation out endlessly...}
<C>__{catwoman}
<D>__{so i think i will let you live. cute boys like you are hard to find...}
<P>__{(standing up)}
<D>__{'bye, angel. i will be thinking about you.}
<A>__{and just like that, she vanishes moving silently off with her raven, leaving batman to dangle. he hangs there a moment, tries to twist himself around without moving his foot. he braces one hand against the wall; with the other, he lifts his grappling gun and fires. the hook snags somewhere on the roof. batman yanks the line taut and is laboriously trying to pull himself erect when the catwoman reappears over the edge of the cornice!}
<C>__{catwoman}
<D>__{gee...i'm so fickle.}
<A>__{a quick swipe of her steel talons, and the whipcord is neatly severed. batman's foot slips out from under him but he's still got hold of the grappling gun. he drops eight or ten feet...}
