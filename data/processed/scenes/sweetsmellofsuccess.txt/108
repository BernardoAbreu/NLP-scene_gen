(at this angle hunsecker's terrace will not be visible but its position is established in relationship to the budweiser sign.) camera pans down to pick up the figure of susan hunsecker as she pushes her way out of the brass doors onto broadway.}

<A>__{susan pauses on the sidewalk. she stays there for a moment. she breathes in the fresh morning air, looking around with the expression of someone who sees the world with new eyes. then she starts up broadway away from the times square area. the girl's step has a purpose in it; she has confidence and courage. music for the end titles is quiet, simple and lyrical.}
