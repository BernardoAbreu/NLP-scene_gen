<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior school library day}
<A>__{as carrie examines a shelf of books with titles like "cosmic consciousness" and r.d. ogilve's "hidden powers of the mind." she decides on the latter just as a voice startles her:}
<C>__{tommy's voice}
<D>__{carrie?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{ohuh?}
<A>__{she stares at him and quickly covers the binding of the book with her hand, covering the title. he looks as startled as she does.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{how're you doing?}
<C>__{carrie}
<P>__{(after a beat; almost inaudibly)}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{it's harder than he thought it would be; just trying to make small talk is agonizing. but try it, he does:}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{i thought you had gym this period.}
<A>__{all she can do is shake her head. and a young man not easily deterred, he tries again.}
<C>__{tommy}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{what're you reading?}
<C>__{carrie}
<P>__{(trying to cover, and not very well)}
<D>__{it's about... um.. sewing...}
<A>__{right. check and stalemate. which brings him to:}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{umm... if you don't have a date for the prom, would you want to go with me?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{the prom...}
<A>__{without saying a word, carrie walks down the aisle of book shelves. he follows her into the main room where students are reading, working.}
<C>__{tommy}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{...it's next friday, and i know this is later notice, but they stop selling tickets soon, and}
<A>__{the bell rings.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{i don't like to be tricked.}
<A>__{a couple of students stare at tommy talking to carrie as they start leaving the library.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{carrie...}
<A>__{but it's too late she's gone, already out the door.}
