<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{that seems like a good choice.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{i don't know whether i'm being sensible or hard on you.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{the two might go together.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{see. there's an example. i don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.}

<C>__{carol}
<D>__{you don't have to answer everything i say. just listen to me. okay?}
<A>__{he nods his head, "yes."}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{it's really something that you're looking after simon. and what i said on the street. that was a bad thing to say. and it made me sick to my stomach. it was a bad thing to say. and i'd be lying if i didn't say that i enjoyed your company... but the truth is you do bother me enormously and i know think that it's best for me to not have contact with you because you're just not ready and you're a pretty old guy to not be ready... and i'm too old to ignore that. but there were extraordinary kindnesses that did take place. so thanks for the trips...}
