<L>__{interior peterbilt cab day}
<A>__{jeff searches the cab for signs of amy. he tosses aside a jacket, rifles papers on the floor. there is nothing.}
<L>__{exterior cab day}
<A>__{sheriff boyd looks up sternly as jeff continues searching the cab. red watches calmly.}
<C>__{sheriff boyd}
<D>__{mr. taylor, either you come down from there or i'm going to have to arrest you.}
<A>__{jeff gives up reluctantly. he looks lame and desperate and he knows it. he steps down from the cab, gritting his teeth.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{it was him. it was this truck.}
<C>__{sheriff boyd}
<D>__{uh huh, i can see that. did you get a license plate?}
<A>__{jeff stares at him, knows where this is going.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{sheriff boyd}
<D>__{what about the information on the door panel. you recall any of that?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i wasn't paying attention.}
<A>__{the sheriff studies him a beat, nods.}
<C>__{sheriff boyd}
<D>__{mr. taylor, did you by any chance have a beef with your wife today?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{what does that have to do with anything?}
<C>__{sheriff boyd}
<D>__{well, for starters, maybe she left you.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i don't believe this...}
<C>__{sheriff boyd}
<D>__{i've seen it a hundred times. lovers, married couples, gay guys. you put two people in a car long enough, they'll go at it. hell, i've even seen men dump their women on the side of the road, and vice versa.}
<A>__{jeff stares at the cop. emphatic:}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{my wife did not leave me.}
<C>__{red}
<P>__{(cuts in)}
<D>__{officer, i'm sorry, i'd like to stay and help, but i really got to make it to fresno...}
<C>__{sheriff boyd}
<D>__{i understand. go ahead, sir. i appreciate your cooperation.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{this is insane. you're just going to let him go?}
<C>__{sheriff boyd}
<D>__{i've got his information. if we need to find him later, we'll know where to look.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{much obliged.}
<P>__{(to jeff)}
<D>__{good luck findin' your wife, mister. no hard feelings.}
<A>__{red climbs into the cab. jeff watches helplessly, resigned to the fact there's nothing more he can do. the sheriff goes to the cruiser and speaks on the radio. as the truck drives off, jeff goes over to the cruiser.}
<C>__{sheriff boyd}
<D>__{sir, i believe you that your wife is missing. maybe you got confused about what truck she got into, maybe you had a fight you don't have to tell me. the point is i'm trying to help.}
<A>__{he hands jeff a card with an address printed on it.}
<C>__{sheriff boyd}
<D>__{the town of brackett's 31 miles that way. my deputy's name is len carver. he's a good man. he'll help you fill out the necessary forms if you want to report your wife missing.}
<A>__{jeff clenches his jaw as the words sink in. the sheriff softens, his tone sympathetic.}
<C>__{sheriff boyd}
<D>__{if you want my opinion, your wife is probably around here. lost or plenty pissed off and giving you a scare. either way, she'll turn up.}
<A>__{as jeff stares at the sheriff, the police radio squawks.}
<C>__{dispatcher }
<P>__{(filtered)}
<D>__{sheriff, this is dispatch. mrs. gilbert's locked out of her trailer again. can you respond?}
<C>__{sheriff boyd}
<P>__{(into mike)}
<D>__{10 4, dispatch. tell her i'm on my way.}
<A>__{he racks the mike.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i want your name and badge number.}
<A>__{the sheriff looks up at jeff, sighs.}
<C>__{sheriff boyd}
<D>__{sheriff arthur boyd. 226 93. this really isn't necessary }
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{don't tell me what's necessary, goddamnit. i'm noting the exact time of this conversation. 10:52 a.m.}
<C>__{sheriff boyd}
<P>__{(exhaling)}
<D>__{suit yourself, mr. taylor.}
<A>__{the sheriff shifts into gear and drives away. jeff is left standing on the side of the road, desert in all directions.}
