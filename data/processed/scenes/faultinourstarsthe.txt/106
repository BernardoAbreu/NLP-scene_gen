<L>__{int church later}
<A>__{hazel enters the literal heart of jesus room which is now empty except for isaac, up on a dais, and gus, in his wheelchair. gus is thinner than we've ever seen him, thinner than any young man should be. but for now, he's happy.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{hazel grace, you look ravishing.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i know, right?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so, um, what's going on guys?}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{you're late.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{late for what exactly?}
<A>__{gus gestures for her to sit next to him and she does.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i wanted to attend my funeral. by the way, will you speak at my funeral?}
<A>__{hazel looks at him like "of course, silly" and then kisses him on the mouth.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{sweet. i'm hopeful i will get to attend as a ghost, but just to make sure, i thought i'd well, not to put you on the spot, but i thought i'd arrange a pre funeral.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{why now?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{no time like the present.}
<C>__{hazel}
<P>__{(looks around the room)}
<D>__{how did you even get in here?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{would you believe they leave the door open at night?}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{um, no.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{as well you shouldn't.}
<A>__{he smiles and for a brief moment it's old gus. hazel laughs. isaac clears his throat.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{"augustus waters was a self aggrandizing bastard. but we forgive him. we forgive him... not because he had a heart as figuratively good as his actual one sucked, or because he got 18 years when he should have gotten more."}
<C>__{gus}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{i'm assuming you've got some time, you interrupting bastard! i mean seriously...}
<P>__{(back to the speech)}
<D>__{"augustus waters talked so much that he'd interrupt you at his own funeral. and he was pretentious.}
<C>__{isaac }
<D>__{sweet jesus that kid never took a piss without pondering the resonances of human waste production. and he was vain. but that comes with superhuman handsomeness."}
<A>__{gus nods that part is true.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{"but i will say this: when the scientists of the future show up at my house with robot eyes and they tell me to try them on, i will tell the scientists to piss off, because i don't even want to see a world without augustus waters."}
<A>__{hazel smiles but it's one that triggers an immediate emotional waterfall.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{"and then, of course, having made my rhetorical point, i will put my robot eyes on because, i mean... robot eyes!"}
<A>__{gus has a big smile on his face.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{"so anyway, augustus, my friend... godspeed."}
<A>__{gus nods a couple times.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{thank you isaac.}
<A>__{this causes isaac to lose it. he clings to the lectern.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{goddamn it, gus.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{hey don't swear in the literal heart of jesus.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{shit! ass! balls!}
<A>__{isaac sighs. wipes away the tears. and another beat passes.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{can i get a hand here, hazel?}
<A>__{hazel remembers isaac can't see. she rises, goes up to get him, walks him back to her seat.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{hazel grace, it's down to you.}
<A>__{hazel takes out a piece of paper, walks up to the dais. takes a beat to ready herself.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{"augustus waters was the great star crossed love of my life. ours was an epic love story, and i won't be able to get more than a sentence into it without disappearing into a puddle of tears.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{like all real love stories ours will die with us, as it should. i'd hoped that he'd be eulogizing me, because there's no one i'd rather have..."}
<A>__{and that's all she can get out before falling apart. she lets it out for a couple beats and then pulls herself together.}
<C>__{hazel}
<P>__{(beat, composing herself)}
<D>__{"i can't talk about our love story so instead i will talk about math. i am not a mathematician, but i know this: there are infinite numbers between 0 and 1. there's .1 and .12 and .112 and an infinite collection of others. of course, there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between 0 and 2, or between 0 and a million. some infinities are bigger than other infinities. a writer we used to like taught us that. i want more numbers than i'm likely to get, and god, i want more numbers for augustus waters than he got. but, gus, my love, i cannot tell you how thankful i am for our little infinity. you gave me a forever within the numbered days, and for that i am eternally grateful. i love you."}
<A>__{gus smiles, nods, and closes his eyes. cut to:}
<C>__{black.}
<A>__{over which we hear a ringing telephone.}
