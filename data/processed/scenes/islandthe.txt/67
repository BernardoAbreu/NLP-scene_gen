<A>__{lincoln stares at his own mirror image. his eyes, fraught with revelation. his clothes, begrimed with dirt and blood. he rests his head against the etherscreen panel, shuddering, pressing his eyes tightly closed. as if he could ever forget what he's seen.}
<L>__{interior. centerville day}
<A>__{the routine flow of residents up the avenue. lincoln walks, head bowed, trying to look inconspicuous. showered, white shirt and blue slacks under his shearling, he looks a little too scrubbed, too clean. he spots a familiar figure up ahead. he catches up.}

<D>__{jonesy. . .}
<A>__{j o n e s lets him fall into step with a look of mild curiosity }
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{hey, champ. are you alright? i heard there was a contamination scare.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{i saw what happened to him.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{starkweather . . . what they did to him.}
<A>__{jones huffs, dismissively. lincoln grabs his shoulder, ardent }
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{they cut him open, jonesy. the y took him upstairs and they cut him open.}
<A>__{jones holds his gaze a moment, then shrugs off his grip.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{you caught that fucking p a t h o g e n , didn't you? you're contaminated.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{j o n e s y , listen to me...}
<A>__{but jones just backs away. lincoln makes to follow. then stops dead in his tracks. across the avenue, two censors are on patrol and his best friend is now heading towards them. with a barren, torn grimace, lincoln turns away and melts back into the crowd.}
