<D>__{we're not supposed }
<C>__{scagnetti}
<D>__{don't worry about it.}
<A>__{bingham and washington move outside. scagnetti takes out his gun and tosses it to washington. before they can protest, scagnetti closes the door. mallory stands in the middle of the cell, motionless, her back to him. scagnetti walks up behind her. mallory doesn't move.}
<C>__{scagnetti}
<D>__{want a smoke?}
<A>__{mallory's steel eyes glare at scagnetti.}
<C>__{scagnetti}
<D>__{c'mon, i already lit one for you. i know you smoke.}

<C>__{scagnetti}
<D>__{i was reading the file on you. you know what it said during your trial, whenever they put you on the stand, no matter what they asked, your answer was always the same...'i love mickey.' it also says that when they gave you a polygraph, 'i love mickey' was the only thing you said that registered as the truth.}
<A>__{scagnetti appears at the side of frame next to mallory.}
<C>__{scagnetti}
<D>__{who are you supposed to be? squeaky fromme? is that it? is mickey your charles manson? is mickey jesus? is that the attraction? or does he just got a big dick?}

<A>__{mallory spits the lit cigarette unto scagnetti's face. scagnetti spins her around and slaps her.}
<C>__{scagnetti}
<D>__{look. you're gonna sit here for a couple hours while i finish up the arrangements. the reason they picked me to be your chaperone is they know i won't hesitate to put a bullet in you.}
<A>__{scagnetti has mallory clutched tightly by her shoulders.}
<C>__{scagnetti}
<D>__{so, during our journey, if any wild hairs spring up on your ass, you'd better slap a muzzle on 'em! fuck with me, bitch, even a little bit, you're gonna get accidentally shot! comprehende?}
<A>__{mallory looks at him for a moment, then gives his a massive head butt. as we hear the cracking of his nose, scagnetti lets out a horrible scream.}
