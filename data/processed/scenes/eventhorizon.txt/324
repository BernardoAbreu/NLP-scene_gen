<L>__{interior event horizon corridor to bridge}
<A>__{starck and miller collapse against the door. a moment passes between them. just happy to be breathing... ...and then the airlock klaxon goes off.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{the forward airlock.}
<L>__{interior event horizon generic corridor}
<A>__{starck and miller race towards the forward airlock bay.}
<L>__{interior event horizon forward airlock bay no. 4}
<A>__{they enter, see a humanoid shape moving in the strobing light of the airlock.}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{weir can't be alive.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{whatever was on that bridge wasn't weir.}
<A>__{miller looks around for a weapon. pulls a zero g bolt cutter from the wall. wields it like a bat.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{stay behind me.}
<A>__{the inner airlock door releases with a hiss. swings open... cooper tumbles through, clawing at his helmet.}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{cooper!}
<A>__{starck rushes to him, takes his helmet off. he sucks air in, coughs it out.}
<C>__{cooper}
<D>__{let me breathe, let me breathe...}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{you're okay now, it's over...}
<C>__{miller}
<P>__{(sees something)}
<D>__{it's not over. it's just starting.}
<A>__{starck follows miller's gaze to a workstations's flashing display: gravity drive engaged. activation 00:06:43:01...}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{weir activated the drive. he's sending us to the other place.}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{we've got to shut it down, we've got to...}
<C>__{cooper}
<D>__{how? the bridge is gone.}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{there must be a way! what about engineering?}
<C>__{cooper}
<D>__{can you shut it down?}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{i don't know the process, dr. weir was the expert...}
<C>__{cooper}
<D>__{i don't want to go where the last crew went. i'd rather be dead.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{blow the fucker up.}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{blow it up?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{we blow the corridor. use the foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it from the rest of the ship. we stay put...}
<C>__{cooper}
<D>__{...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.}
