<A>__{close on black earth. a trowel digs into the soil. we pull back. jack's just finished digging a hole in the flower bed. a shoebox beside him. he takes off the lid. the chick trembles in the corner of the box. jack slowly replaces the lid. puts the box into the grave. he pushes the earth over it. the box jerks. we hear the faint rustling of the chick inside.}
