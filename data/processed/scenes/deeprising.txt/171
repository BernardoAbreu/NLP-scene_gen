<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior engine room night}
<A>__{the captain is stuck in a strange gelatinous spider web. struggling, frantic. but the more he struggles, the more enmeshed he gets. he holds his hands out beseechingly to canton, who stands looking at him in terror.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{help me!}
<A>__{but canton does not move. all of a sudden canton sees something deep in the web, behind the captain, which makes his blood freeze.}
<C>__{captain }
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{canton takes a few steps back.}
<C>__{captain }
<D>__{what?!... what?!}
<A>__{the captain tries to look over his shoulder to see what it is. there is a dark movement deep within the spider web.}
<C>__{captain }
<D>__{help me, canton! help meeeeeee!!}
<A>__{angle on: finnegan and trillian racing across a catwalk. below them, they can see canton backing away from the captain.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{grab his hands!!}
<A>__{canton looks up, stunned, as he sees finnegan and trillian rushing down from the catwalk.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{canton!! help!!}
<A>__{canton backs away from the captain, as the captain's struggle draws him further into the web. the captain's eyes bulge, horrified, as he feels something inside the spider web grab him from behind.}
<C>__{captain }
<D>__{it hurts!!!!! it hurrrrrtttttssss!!!}
<A>__{he struggles wildly. then starts to freeze up as the tentacles wrap around him. finnegan and trillian race across the floor as the captain is slowly sucked deeper into the spider web; his face and body bady constricting, paralyzed. his voice is choked off. hanover, chin, mamooli and pantucci burst out of another alleyway. finnegan and trillian reach the captain just as his face is sucked into the gelatinous web. they skid to a stop. everybody piles up. eyes wide. watching as the captain's body is pulled deeper into the dark web. tentacles enveloping him.}
<C>__{hanover}
<P>__{(to canton)}
<D>__{where is the closest hatch?}
<A>__{canton still pressed against the wall, staring at the spot the captain disappeared, talking to himself.}
<C>__{canton}
<D>__{i never meant for anyone to get hurt ...it was supposed to be clean...}
<A>__{hanover grabs canton by the front of his tattered tuxedo jacket.}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{you hypocritical bastard...all you gave a shit about was the money... where's the hatch!!}
<A>__{canton points down a darkened passageway.}
<C>__{hanover }
<D>__{alright let's move out...you two on pointerior..}
<A>__{he looks at an uneasy mamooli and chin.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{joey... which way's aft?}
<C>__{pantucci}
<D>__{that way.}
<A>__{he points in the opposite direction.}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{who gives a shit about aft?}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{that's where my boat's moored.}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{you trying to take over my show finnegan, that what you trying to do?}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{just trying to get to my boat...}
<A>__{finnegan takes off down a catwalk in the opposite direction that disappears in the dark. pantucci is right with him. trillian, a step behind.}
<C>__{hanover}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{you stay away from that vault! you hear me?}
<A>__{just before he steps into the darkness, finnegan calls over his shoulder...}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{they respond to sound...}
<A>__{he disappears into the dark. canton looks at hanover for a long moment, and then takes off after finnegan. the other two mercs look at hanover, wavering.}
<C>__{hanover}
<P>__{(tense)}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{the sound of his voice makes the two mercs look around nervously.}
<C>__{mamooli}
<P>__{(whispered)}
<D>__{he made sense.}
<C>__{hanover}
<P>__{(loud)}
<D>__{he's a bloody...}
<A>__{and then conscious of his voice reverberating...}
<C>__{hanover }
<P>__{(whispered)}
<D>__{...he's a bloody taxi driver!}
<A>__{chin breaks for the catwalk, hurrying after finnegan. hanover stands with a very antsy mamooli, steaming. after a long moment, he strides off after finnegan as well.}
