<A>__{mo runs down the hallway after tiny tim. the hammer turns towards the other direction to find... two elves on multi colored mopeds comin' right for him. the hammer stands motionless as the elves gain ground. right before they reach him, the hammer quickly pulls his talis off of his neck and holds it outstretched, clotheslining the two off of their mopeds. the elves are out cold. the hammer admires his work. santa, running for his life, rounds the corner. he stops dead in his tracks as he spots the hammer. the two look at one another for a brief moment, and then santa points at something behind the hammer.}
