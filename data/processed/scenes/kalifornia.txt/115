<L>__{exterior motel corridor}
<A>__{at the far end of a narrow hallway, carrie finds an ice machine rumbling away noisily. the only illumination, a single fluorescent light bulb, hangs suspended above it.}
<B>__{at the ice machine}
<A>__{with her arm buried inside the ice machine, carrie scavenges for what little ice there is... when, out of the corner of her eye, she notices... someone standing at the other end of the corridor. the silhouette of a man. carrie stops. her eyes scan the claustrophobic hallway for another way out. there is none. she tries to ignore the situation. grabs another handful of ice cubes. the man approaches. carrie stops again. her mind races. the man's face slowly becomes visible as he nears the fluorescent light. it's early.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{...brian hurt his foot.}
<A>__{early reaches past her into the ice machine and grabs a solitary cube. he puts it in his mouth, sucks on it. his torso is drenched in sweat. he catches carrie staring at him.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{sometimes... don't know why it is... i get so hot i can't stand it. i just start sweating like a dog. you ever get like that?}
<C>__{carrie}
<P>__{(tenuous)}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{early spits the ice cube back into his hand. he presses it against the back of his neck.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{i can feel it start to run down my neck...}
<P>__{(he turns his back to show her)}
<D>__{...and down my back... right into my pants.}
<A>__{carrie follows a bead of ice water as it slides down between his shoulder blades and along his back.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{...and everything starts stickin' together... keeps running down the back of my legs like two rivers racin' for my boots, see who gets there first.}
<A>__{he snaps a look back to carrie and finds her looking at his ass. she diverts her glance.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{you never get that hot, huh?}
<A>__{carrie shakes her head no. early looks in his hand to see that his ice cube has melted.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{i gotta get back before this ice melts.}
<A>__{carrie tries to slip past him. he reaches back into the machine, momentarily blocking her exit. he grabs another ice cube. his face only inches from hers.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{...never?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{no, never. excuse me.}
<A>__{he pops the ice cube in his mouth and lets her pass.}
<C>__{early}
<D>__{you like skynard?}
<A>__{no response, early chews up the ice cube.}
