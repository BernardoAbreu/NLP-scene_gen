<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior backstage, constitutional hall, washington, d.c. night}
<A>__{we are standing in the wings. through the curtains, we glimpse the eager, packed house in an auditorium. from the stage, a speaker drones, but backstage... ...george peeks out at the throng. when he looks back, we see amelia, her troubled face. the folded newspaper in her hand.}
<C>__{amelia }
<D>__{‘only an average flyer, she has pushed herself to the front by following the tactics of the feminists...}
<A>__{she looks up to him.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{well, i’m glad someone besides me finally noticed.}
<A>__{his smile is light. her eyes watching him. then...}
<C>__{amelia }
<D>__{‘using a man made perfect machine, tuned by men mechanics, trained by men flyers, on a course laid out by a man. by a lucky break she just managed to make the hop.’}
<A>__{she stares at the paper. his voice comes gently...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{why would you even read that garbage?}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{well, it reminds me how much i owe to the men of this world. keeps me humble.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{good. and remembering how little you owe me keeps me humble.}
<A>__{and softly...}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{he’s a crackpot. let it go.}
<A>__{he points to the packed hall...}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{cheer up. they're crazy about you.}
<C>__{amelia }
<D>__{well, they're crazy about something.}
<A>__{she looks down. self doubt flickers.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{what have we really done?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you've made them feel like this.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{that's not enough.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{most of them are women. and for them, it's very much enough.}
<A>__{she shakes her head.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{the world telegram said, ‘a magnificent display of useless courage.’}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{the question is. can any magnif icent display of courage be use less?}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{the point is. men do it every day. and no one throws a parade.}
<A>__{ah. well...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{one day closer, then. to the day when they won't think to throw one for you.}
<A>__{she doesn't turn. she doesn't smile.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{reasoning with me. a magnificent display of useless courage.}
<A>__{he nods to himself.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{and. it's fun.}
<A>__{from the stage...}
<C>__{announcer }
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen. the president of the united states.}
<A>__{hail to the chief strikes up. we hear the deep applause. george begins to straighten amelia's outfit, touching her hair, as he did long ago on the copley hotel roof.}
<C>__{president hoover }
<D>__{the gold medal of the national geo graphic society was last awarded five years ago to col. charles lindbergh.}
<A>__{george murmurs close to her ear...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{if a bomb goes off tonight, the whole government of the united states is out there...}
<C>__{president hoover }
<D>__{it has never been awarded to a woman...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{some dog catcher will have to become president.}
<A>__{she smiles. just for him.}
<C>__{president hoover }
<D>__{until tonight.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{boy. imagine if you'd actually done something.}
<C>__{amelia }
<D>__{imagine.}
<C>__{president hoover }
<D>__{it is my honor to welcome to consti tution hall, a role model for ladies everywhere...}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{ladies.}
<C>__{president hoover }
<D>__{miss amelia earhart.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{miss.}
<A>__{she's through the curtain, and the crowd crackles with applause as... ...george stands in the wings. proud. and concerned.}
