<A>__{tom is walking along when he turns the corner of hank's house and finds; annie sitting alone, staring up at the night. they see each other. from behind the house, no one else can see them. it is as if the fates brought them face to face and alone. without any will to stop it, they embrace and kiss passionately. but when they look into each other's eyes, there is no joy in the kiss. tom releases her and walks away, heading for the shed. annie quickly pulls herself together and enters the main house through the back door.}
