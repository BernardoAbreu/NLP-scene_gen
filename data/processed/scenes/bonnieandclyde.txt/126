<A>__{the barrow gang piles out of their car and walks over, having a merry time. they surround the car and press their faces against the window, flattening their features, making menacing gestures at the shaking pair inside. we see this from the point of view of the man and woman inside the car. clyde pulls out a gun, makes as if to shoot, but he is kidding. they all laugh uproariously, especially buck who is delighted with clyde's prank. all of this we see in pantomime from inside the trapped car.}
