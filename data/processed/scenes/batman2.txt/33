<D>__{guess what, alfred. i think i found a present for bruce.}
<A>__{she's got a long, skinny gift box propped up against the exterior wall. at first it doesn't want to fit through the door it must be eight feet long but with alfred's help she gets it inside. the faithful butler stares curiously at this odd shaped gift...}

<A>__{still in the clinch, bruce shoots a look at alfred. taking the hint, alfred clears his throat and bends to pick up one end of the ski box. he backs out of the entry hall, dragging the box before him...}
