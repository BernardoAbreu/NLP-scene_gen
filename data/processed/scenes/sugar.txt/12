<L>__{interior miguel's home night}
<A>__{miguel and erica enter the house, where their brother luis (7) watches an enormous television, which feels incongruous in the middle of the tiny, dilapidated home. the reception is still crappy, though. miguel's grandmother, abuela, sits upright on her mattress in the corner of the room.}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{hello, abuela. you're looking beautiful.}
<A>__{she smiles big at her oldest grandson, opens her arms for a hug. erica sits at the kitchen table, where her schoolbooks lay open.}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{what's up my people? how's the tv?}
<C>__{luis}
<D>__{erica won't let me watch baseball.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{not during american idol, anyway.}
<A>__{miguel's mother, carmen (late 30s) emerges from behind a hanging bed sheet, which acts as a "wall" separating two rooms.}
<C>__{carmen}
<D>__{buenas, miguelito! do you have any good news for your mother?}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{as a matter of fact, yes.}
<C>__{carmen}
<D>__{you're going to the united states?!}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{not yet, ma... but i learned how to throw a knuckle curve.}
<C>__{carmen}
<D>__{a knuckle curve? what's that?}
<A>__{a group of kids gather at the window.}
<C>__{kids}
<D>__{sugar, come out and play!}
