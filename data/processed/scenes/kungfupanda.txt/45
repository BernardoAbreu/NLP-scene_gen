<A>__{shifu snaps. monkey twirls a bamboo staff. he lunges at po who takes a comical beating. shifu snaps. po and crane prepare to spar atop the turtle bowl. crash. po falls in and is tossed around like a sack of soup. shifu snaps. we see a series of shots of po falling on his face at the hands of some invisible opponent, who turns out to be... mantis. shifu smiles. flat on his back, po manages a salute. shifu has had it.}
