<A>__{alike attacks her closet, ripping all the "girly" shirts from the hangers and hurling them toward a small vanity trashcan. she plunges back in and slams an armful of blouses to the floor. she launches a pair of pumps into the wall, followed by a chunky pair of timberlands. silent sobs rack her body as she tears off her own shirt and slings it at the mirror. she strips off her jeans and kicks them brutally into a corner. alike considers her unclothed form in the mirror before collapsing onto the bed. she writhes against the pillows and covers her eyes with her elbow as darts of grief twist through her body. blackout.}
