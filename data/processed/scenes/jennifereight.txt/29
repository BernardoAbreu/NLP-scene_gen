<A>__{mussorgsky is back on a shock cut. big music and a shattering landscape. juniper woods and mountains. sunlight on fresh fal len snow. somewhere a long way off a car crawls up the valley. ross's car bursts into frame and as quickly the bend snatches it away. an unexpected building in the distance. victorian at a glance but probably later. a clock tower and fifty lifeless windows. the chevy disappears towards its somber architecture.}
