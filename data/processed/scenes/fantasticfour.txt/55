<A>__{a view from brooklyn: manhattan glistens in the distance. camera moves down to a train yard, where we find empty cargo trains. we push in on the main track, where... a cargo train has just stopped. we hear a cargo door slide open, then whump! big feet hit the ground. someone, or something barrels into the night.}
