<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{look at me! i'm hurt now!}

<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{the longer this went on the worse it would have been. i guarantee it!}

<D>__{yes, i do, kirk! i know exactly what i'm talking about.}
<C>__{willy}

<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{two months into it, she dumps me. and i knew it was coming. a girl like that. sooner or later she was bound to get a better offer. but it kicked my ass, man. i was depressed for months.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{that's what that was? you said you had that fatigue syndrome thing.}
