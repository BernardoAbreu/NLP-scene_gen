<L>__{interior upper landing day}
<A>__{the door of the torture room creaks, as the wind blows it opens an inch. from downstairs, we hear julia's voice.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{it smells damp.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{it's just been empty a while.}
<L>__{interior hallway day}
<A>__{larry slams the front door.}
<L>__{interior upper landing day}
<A>__{the torture room door creaks closed again.}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(from below)}
<D>__{besides, it's an old house.}
<L>__{interior hallway day}
<A>__{he stands in the hallway, not certain which way to go from here.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{how long since you were here?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{the best part of ten years.}
<A>__{larry picks up some mail circulars mostly from behind the door, then leads julia through from the hallway to explore the ground floor.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i wanted to sell it off at one point, after the old lady died, but i couldn't get frank to agree.}
<A>__{he opens one of the doors, and looks inside.}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(with pleasure)}
<D>__{christ. it's not been touched.}
<A>__{he continues along the passageway. he opens another door, and steps into a large room. he opens one of the curtains. light pours in, dust laden shafts falling on the sheeted furniture.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{look at this.}
<A>__{julia lingers in the doorway.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{why didn't he want to sell it?}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(dismissively)}
<D>__{i don't know. probably wanted a hideaway.}
<A>__{he pulls a sheet off a chair.}
<D>__{look at this stuff.}
<A>__{the chair is ugly; old fashioned. julia is unimpressed.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{not exactly modern.}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{we'll sell it. sell everything.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{i thought half of it was your brother's?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{he won't complain. he can pay off some of his creditors.}
<A>__{larry is getting more enthusiastic about the place by the moment. he leaves the room, moving past julia to explore further.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{you know we have to let kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. she'll love it.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{you mean we're moving in?}
<A>__{larry pauses. looks at her.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{you don't like it?}
<A>__{julia shrugs.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{it's better than brooklyn.}
<A>__{she turns back down the hallway. he watches her, then follows.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{you're still blaming me.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{no. i'm not.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{you wanted to come back to london. we came back.}
<A>__{we are hearing the tip of a debate they've had dozens of times, which immediately annoys them both.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{all right.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{so what's the argument?}
<C>__{julia}
<P>__{(cold)}
<D>__{no argument.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{oh christ. julia ...}
<A>__{julia wanders back to the bottom of the stairs. then starts to climb.}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(exasperated, to himself)}
<D>__{shit.}
