<A>__{michael, the senator, neri and rocco make a group in the dark, large room.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{it was very kind of you to come to my home on this occasion, senator. my wife has been very concerned with making a good impression on the people who are our neighbors, and your appearance here has made her very happy. if i can ever perform a service for you, you only have to ask.}
<A>__{the door opens, and hagen sheepishly makes his way in.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{my lawyer, tom hagen. he arranged this all through your man turnbull.}
<C>__{senator geary}
<D>__{i thought we would meet alone.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i trust these men with my life. they are my right arms; i cannot insult them by sending them away.}
<C>__{senator geary}
<P>__{(taking out some medication)}
<D>__{some water.}
<A>__{he addresses that to neri, who resentfully goes to fetch the senator a glass of water.}
<C>__{senator geary}
<D>__{alright, corleone. i'm going to be very frank with you. maybe more frank than any man in my position has ever spoken to you before.}
<A>__{michael nods, indicating that he should do so.}
<C>__{senator geary}
<D>__{the corleone family controls two major hotels in vegas; one in reno. the licenses were grandfathered in, so you had no difficulties with the gaming commission. but i have the idea from sources...}
<P>__{(takes the water from neri and swallows his pills)}
<D>__{...that you're planning to move in on the tropicana. in another week or so you'll move klingman out, which leaves you with only one technicality. the license, which is now in klingman's name.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{turnbull is a good man.}
<C>__{senator geary}
<D>__{let's forget the bullshit, i don't want to stay here any longer than i have to. you can have the license for two hundred and fifty thousand in cash, plus a monthly fee equal to five percent of the gross...}
<A>__{michael is taken aback; he looks at hagen.}
<C>__{senator geary}
<D>__{...of all three corleone hotels.}
<A>__{hagen is frustrated; all his information was wrong.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{senator geary, i speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state. i have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here. the license fee from the gambling commission costs one thousand dollars; why would i ever consider paying more?}
<C>__{senator geary}
<D>__{i'm going to squeeze you, corleone, because i don't like you; i don't like the kind of man you are. i despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.}
<B>__{view on hagen}
<A>__{glances at michael.}
<B>__{view on michael}
<A>__{makes no outward reaction.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{we're all part of the same hypocrisy, senator. but never think it applies to my family.}
<C>__{senator geary}
<D>__{all right, then let me say you'll pay me because it's in your interests to pay me.}
<B>__{view on geary}
<A>__{rising.}
<C>__{senator geary}
<D>__{i will expect your answer, with payment, by tomorrow morning. only don't contact me...from now on, deal only through turnbull.}
<A>__{he is almost out the door.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{senator...}
<P>__{(cold and calm)}
<D>__{...you can have my answer now if you'd like.}
<A>__{geary turns back.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{my offer is this. nothing...not even the thousand dollars for the gaming commission, which i'd appreciate if you would put up personally.}
<A>__{geary returns michael's hard look; then laughs and leaves. slowly michael turns to hagen.}
<B>__{view on hagen}
<A>__{embarrassed at being so off the mark.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{it's all right, tom, we'll talk later. tell frankie pentangeli i'd like him to have dinner at my family table before we do business.}
