<L>__{interior children’s bedroom night}
<A>__{steven flops robbie onto his pillow just as a flash lights the room and the tree outside the window. carol anne lies awake, watching.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{i don’t like the tree, dad.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{it’s an old tree. it was here for a long time. long before my company built this neighborhood.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{i don’t like its arms. it knows i live here, doesn’t it?}
<C>__{steven}
<P>__{(not aware this scares robbie)}
<D>__{it knows everything about us. that’s why i built our home next to it. so it could protect you and carol anne, dana, your mom and me. it’s a wise old tree.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{it looks at me. it knows i live here.}
<A>__{robbie is visibly frightened now and steven realizes he’s scared him. just then a tremor of thunder rolls through the bedroom and robbie snuggles up to his dad.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{storm’s gonna miss us.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{because i can count.}
<A>__{then more thunder. robbie flinches, but tries to be brave.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{after you see the lightning, count until you hear the thunder. if you can count higher each time, that means the storm is moving away from you.}
<A>__{a flash of lightning is seen.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{now count with me. robbie steven carol anne one, two, three...}
<A>__{thunder is heard.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{next time you’ll be able to count to four or more. you try it, okay?}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{steven exits leaving the door open. lightning occurs. steven waits by the partially open door and listens as robbie counts.}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(very worried)}
<D>__{one... two... three... four... five...}
<A>__{distant thunder is heard. robbie is more relieved.}
