<A>__{as john starts cooking up a storm...there is some velocity to his cooking...he still seethes. then reacts as spanish music starts to play. he clears his throat as if he must make a speech. then does so again..some vocal spasm paying tribute to the increasingly intoxicating tension he feels.}
<L>__{interior restaurant dining area night...}
<A>__{flor is lighting the candle at each of the twenty tables.}
<L>__{interior restaurant kitchen night...}
<A>__{he is cooking..he is talking to himself.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{nothing to be nervous about. you are not on a date...}
<P>__{(calls out)}

<C>__{flor's voice }
<D>__{yes, john.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{she enters the room...dancing a bit..}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{just lighting candles and picking music.}
<P>__{(notices his cooking)}
<D>__{oooh.}
<A>__{she gets up on one of the counters and sits there, her feet dangling...sings along a bit in spanish. he is uncomfortable anew. the nervousness mounting.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you want a drink?}
<A>__{she considers the question totally..he is busy cooking..not realizing how weighty she considers his question...finally aware she has not answered and looks at her..}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{huh?}
<A>__{she regards him levelly..then makes her decision.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{he gets out a bottle of vodka.}
<C>__{flor }
<D>__{i, uh...don't think you should either.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{then excuse me, because if i had the equipment i'd inject the vodka.}
<A>__{he starts to pour.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{wait!}
<P>__{(he stops)}
<D>__{i think it is so important that we are each clear headed.}
<A>__{he looks at her..a beat...he puts the vodka away. flor beams..we have not seen her smile like this for quite some time.}
<C>__{flor }
<D>__{it is very good that you did not ask, "why?"}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(quietly)}
