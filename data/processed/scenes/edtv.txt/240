<L>__{interior network conference room day}
<A>__{big meeting. many honchos, including scharlach and cynthia. all but cynthia are focused. cynthia looks bored.}
<D>__{honcho #l i think this could be great. what if ed and shari decide to get married? a wedding? the cute, little half asian nephew in a tuxedo, carrying the ring on one of those big fluffy pillows we'11 kill. a sixty share.}
<A>__{a secretary (mildred) enters. she's a little flustered.}
<C>__{mildred}
<D>__{um... mr. scharlach, um you're not watching tv?}
<C>__{scharlach}
<D>__{no, mildred, we're working.}
<C>__{mildred}
<D>__{um... ed and shari are }
<C>__{seaver}
<D>__{engaged?}
<C>__{mildred}
<D>__{no. here. they're in the building. they're on their way up.}
<A>__{scharlach indicates that he wants someone to turn on the tv. someone does and they see ed and shari coming down the hall. they enter the conference room. the cameras, of course, are with them. ed is carrying a carton.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{hi, kids. busy?}
<B>__{much confusion}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{i just came up to pass out these ed tv hats.}
<A>__{he takes a lot of hats out of the carton and begins placing on the heads of the honchos.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{a guy made these up for me. he spelled ed with two d's. okay, listen. the real reason i came up here and then i'11 get out of your way is i've been thinking about what you said. about let's start having more fun with this show, you know? let's give it a big kick in the ass. honcho #1 well, we were thinking }
<C>__{ed}
<P>__{(cheerfully)}
<D>__{shut up.}
<A>__{he takes back that honcho's hat.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{let's have a contest. now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives. but anyone can join in.}
<C>__{shari}
<P>__{(rehearsed)}
<D>__{what do we have to do?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{my lovely assistant, shari. i'm glad you asked. the contest is who can dig up legally, of course i'm not suggesting that anyone break any laws the most embarrassing and humiliating facts about any of the executives here at the north american broadcasting system which owns real tv.}
<A>__{the honchos staring blankly.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{but facts! they have to be verified. anything from their past, their present, business, personal arrests, affairs ... and whoever comes up with the sleaziest, most degrading material i'11 give you ten thousand dollars. and you get to be on ed tv.}
<P>__{(to the honchos, excitedly)}
<D>__{hah?}
<C>__{shari}
<D>__{so act now. here's ed's home phone number.}
<A>__{she holds up a card.}
