<L>__{interior the blandings' bathroom night}
<A>__{jim, in his pajamas and overcoat is shaving. after a few moments muriel, in her nightgown and overcoat, enters the scene.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{excuse...}
<A>__{she takes her toothbrush and opens the cabinet, jim automatically moving around back of it in their previously established pattern. as muriel puts the paste on her brush, replaces the tube, shuts the cabinet and starts to brush her teeth, jim uncomfortably moves back to his original position.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{excuse...}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{muriel, do you have to do that now?!}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{there's no need to be so irritable just because you have to shave at night.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i'm not irritable!}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{well, you're certainly something! you haven't said a civil word all evening.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{sometimes a man doesn't feel like talking.}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(solicitously)}
<D>__{what is it, dear? something down at the office?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{have you got the new slogan for "wham"?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{it's not due yet!}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{well, it's something. you're certainly upset about something. i can always tell.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i'm not upset.}
<P>__{(going back to shaving; with studied unconcern)}
<D>__{it's just that i don't happen to approve of falsehood and deception. particularly in my own wife.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(same)}
<D>__{oh, nothing. it's just that i distinctly remember your telling me you gave back bill's fraternity pin fifteen years ago.}
<A>__{muriel looks at him, puzzled.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{well, did you or didn't you?}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{did i, or didn't i what?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{give it back to him.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{of course i did. if i said i did, i did.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(suddenly sam spade)}
<D>__{then perhaps you'd have the goodness to explain how this happened to fall out of your jewel box?}
<A>__{he takes the pin out of his pocket and hands it to her. muriel takes the pin, looks at it sentimentally. suddenly she looks at jim and bursts out laughing.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{what's so funny?}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{you! you're jealous! you're standing there with your face full of soap and you're jealous.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{if you were so crazy about the guy, why didn't you marry him?!}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(beginning to be a little angry)}
<D>__{because i wasn't in love with him!}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(vindictively)}
<D>__{that's not what you said in your diary!}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(now really angry)}
<D>__{oh, now you've been reading my diary!}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(a little guilty)}
<D>__{well it happened to fall open and... i... happened to look at it. it... just happened.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{i will just bet!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{it's all over the book so why don't you admit it? you were in love with bill cole!}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{don't be absurd! of course i was in love with bill. in those days i was in love with a new man every week.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{then why did you marry me?}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{i'm beginning to wonder!}
<P>__{(exploding)}
<D>__{maybe it was those big cow eyes of yours or that ridiculous hole in your chin! maybe i knew that some day you'd bring me out to this thirty eight thousand dollar icebox with a dried up trout stream and no windows! or maybe i just happened to fall in love with you but for heaven's sake, don't ask me why!}
<A>__{muriel stalks out of the bathroom. jim looks after her, thoughtfully starts to dry his face.}
