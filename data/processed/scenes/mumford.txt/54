<L>__{exterior mumford's porch, the duplex house night}
<A>__{this porch is directly above lily's porch. mumford and skip sit nursing beers. there's a cooler on the floor. mumford's legs are propped up on the porch railing}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{who else knows?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{just you.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{it's time you did some talkin', dr. mum wait a minute. that is your name, isn't it?}
<A>__{mumford takes a drink of beer.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{damn! what is your name?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{doesn't matter. you can call me doc.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{it matters to me.}
<A>__{mumford gestures: "sorry, no can do."}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{i've told you a lot of private stuff.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{i can tell you anything else.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{what about everything? how did this happen?}
<A>__{mumford looks at skip, considering. he takes a long pull from his beer, then looks at the frosty bottle.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{did you know that every species of mammal has found some way to drug, inebriate, or anestnetize itself? even if it's just banging its head against a rock. seems to be some natural urge... to get away for a while.}
<P>__{(one more look at skip)}
<D>__{i've had it for as long as i can remember. the first place i wanted out of was home...}
<A>__{as mumford talks we see images from his past, all from mumford's pov. we do not see him in the scenes. instead, everyone else in the scene relates to the camera as mumford, even if they're just ignoring him.}
