<L>__{exterior rooftop continuous}
<A>__{as julius' head appears, clawing his way onto the tar papered surface, running to the opposite side. a second later, jason hops up right behind him.}
<B>__{reverse angle}
<A>__{as julius soon learns the awful truth that the only way up is the only way down...with the exception of a head splitting freefall. no way is he gonna jump. julius turns back to jason, raising his fists, psyching himself up for the fight of his life. he whispers to himself:}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{use the combos and keep the feet light...}
<A>__{the fight begins, man against monster, each sizing the other up. jason takes the first swing, julius deftly dodging him and countering with left right left combination. they have absolutely no effect. julius follows up with a round of kidney punches. again, nothing. julius finds himself being forced back against the rings, which in this case is the edge of the roof. he risks a glance backwards and sees: julius' point of view it's a long, rough way down. it's do or die time.}
<B>__{return to scene}
<A>__{as julius slams punch after punch into jason, forcing him back to the center of the rooftop, spending every last ounce of his energy in doing so. he throws one more feeble punch, knowing it's his last.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{take your best shot, motherfucker...}
<A>__{jason gladly obliges, winding up and recoiling with a punch none of us expected... julius' head (efx) gets literally knocked off his shoulders, cascading off the edge of the rooftop, and: angle slanted lower roof the decapitated head lands on a sloped roof below, rolling down towards street level and falling into a garbage filled dumpster.}
