<L>__{exterior streets of london night}
<A>__{autumnal streets seen through the sooty glass of a street lamp. shadows within shadows. fog in the air. full moon.}
<C>__{watson }
<D>__{the year was 1891. london was the capital of the world the height of modernity, with the hiss of steam and smell of coal in the air. it was also the great cesspool into which all the sinners and criminals of the empire drained.}
<A>__{gas hisses audibly, the street lamp ignites, and casts a pool of light onto the street, silhouetting a man making his way through the fog and dark shadows with a lantern.}
<C>__{watson }
<D>__{i had come to london, ten years prior, to find a life after the afghan war. i had hoped to start a medical practice and settle into a nice, steady existence. the life i found was anything but nice and steady.}
<A>__{we can see that the man wears a cape. the distinctive silhouette of his deerstalker hat is unmistakable. a furious clatter of hooves approaches in the distance. the man tugs on a pipe and turns towards the growing stampede.}
<C>__{watson }
<D>__{and that had everything to do with one man. my friend, my partner, my burden...}
<A>__{the man exhales a plume of smoke calmly, giving us the impression that he knows something that we don't.}
<C>__{watson }
<D>__{... sherlock holmes.}
<A>__{wham! the man in the deerstalker hat is knocked flat by a running man who has vaulted over a wall, sending him, his pipe, and hat flying across the cobbles. the running man leans down as if to assist, but instead just picks up the smoker's broken umbrella and studies it. the man in the deerstalker hat's eyes widen as he recognizes his famous assailant.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{sherlock holmes?!}
<A>__{sherlock holmes offers the handle of the umbrella to the man, hauls him to his feet and hands back his broken umbrella.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{my apologies. send the bill to john watson, 221b baker street.}
<A>__{sherlock holmes sprints off down an alleyway. the man takes a step into the road to watch him go and is nearly flattened for good by the first of a number of police carriages, hurtling by on a serious pursuit, victorian style.}
