<L>__{interior kitchen night}
<A>__{curtis turns up a bottle of peroxide and swishes it in his mouth. it burns. he spits into the kitchen sink. samantha sits at the table watching him. concerned, scared. she holds a balled up tissue in her hand. curtis takes a seat across the table. she waits for him to say something.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{i haven't been honest with you. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{what's goin' on?}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{i've been havin' these dreams. i guess they're more like nightmares. it's why i've been actin' like this.}
<A>__{samantha listens with a furrowed brow.}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{they always start with a kind of storm. like a real powerful storm.}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{and there's always this dark, thick rain. like fresh motor oil. and then the things, people, it just makes `em crazy. they attack me. sometimes they go after hannah. first one i had red nearly chewed through my arm.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{that's why you put him out back?}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{what was the dream? tonight.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{it was dewart. we were at the job site. the storm started and somethin' happened. his face. his eyes were different. he came after me with a pick ax. and we fought. and he ran it through my leg.}
<A>__{curtis zones out for a moment. samantha says nothing.}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{it's hard to explain, because it's not just a dream. it's a feeling. i'm afraid something might be comin'. something that's...not right. i can not describe it. i just need you to believe me.}
<A>__{samantha's eyes are red. her nose. she nods slightly and dabs the tissue at the corner of her eye.}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{i've been to a counselor. i've seen her a few times.}
<A>__{this makes samantha look up.}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{you know what i come from. and i promised myself...i promised myself i would never leave. and i am doin' everything that i can to make that true.}
<A>__{the room is quiet. samantha watches her husband.}
