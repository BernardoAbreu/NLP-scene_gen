<A>__{mia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the bathroom sink. her head jerks up from the rush.}
<C>__{mia}
<P>__{(imitating steppenwolf)}
<D>__{i said goddamn!}
<L>__{interior jackrabbit slim's (dining area) night}
<A>__{vincent digs into his douglas sirk steak. as he chews, his eyes scan the hellsapopinish restaurant. mia comes back to the table.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{don't you love it when you go to the bathroom and you come back to find your food waiting for you?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{we're lucky we got it at all. buddy holly doesn't seem to be much of a waiter. we shoulda sat in marilyn monroe's section.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{which one, there's two marilyn monroes.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{no there's not.}
<A>__{pointing at marilyn in the white dress serving a table.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{that's marilyn monroe...}
<A>__{then, pointing at a blonde waitress in a tight sweater and capri pants, taking an order from a bunch of film geeks}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{... and that's mamie van doren. i don't see jayne mansfield, so it must be her night off.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{pretty smart.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i have moments.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{did ya think of something to say?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{actually, there's something i've wanted to ask you about, but you seem like a nice person, and i didn't want to offend you.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like mindless, boring, getting to know you chit chat. this sounds like you actually have something to say.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{only if you promise not to get offended.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{you can't promise something like that. i have no idea what you're gonna ask. you could ask me what you're gonna ask me, and my natural response could be to be offended. then, through no fault of my own, i woulda broken my promise.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{then let's just forget it.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{that is an impossibility. trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{is that a fact?}
<A>__{mia nods her head: "yes."}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{besides, it's more exciting when you don't have permission.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{what do you think about what happened to antwan?}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{who's antwan?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{tony rocky horror.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{he fell out of a window.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{that's one way to say it. another way is, he was thrown out. another was is, he was thrown out by marsellus. and even another way is, he was thrown out of a window by marsellus because of you.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{is that a fact?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{no it's not, it's just what i heard.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{who told you this?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{they.}
<A>__{mia and vincent smile.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{they talk a lot, don't they?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{they certainly do.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{well don't by shy vincent, what exactly did they say?}
<A>__{vincent is slow to answer.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{let me help you bashful, did it involve the f word?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{no. they just said rocky horror gave you a foot massage.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{and...?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{no and, that's it.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{you heard marsellus threw rocky horror out of a four story window because he massaged my feet?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{and you believed that?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{at the time i was told, it seemed reasonable.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{marsellus throwing tony out of a four story window for giving me a foot massage seemed reasonable?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{no, it seemed excessive. but that doesn't mean it didn't happen. i heard marsellus is very protective of you.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{a husband being protective of his wife is one thing. a husband almost killing another man for touching his wife's feet is something else.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{but did it happen?}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{the only thing antwan ever touched of mine was my hand, when he shook it. i met anwan once at my wedding then never again. the truth is, nobody knows why marsellus tossed tony rocky horror out of that window except marsellus and tony rocky horror. but when you scamps get together, you're worse than a sewing circle.}
