<D>__{where the hell did she go?}
<A>__{in the control booth ray and robbie share a look. the lights have been dimmed in jim's booth, and he's weaving back and forth a bottle of ripple in his hand as they kick in with the music. camera closing now on jim in the tender section, on the money.}
<D>__{jim & doors can you give me sanctuary i must find a place to hide a place for me to hide...}
<A>__{in the darkened booth, pam is on her knees his pants worked down around his ankles, caressing him, sucking him off.}

<P>__{(the monk bought lunch)}
<D>__{successful hills are here to stay everything must be this way gentle street where people play welcome to the soft parade}
<A>__{but jim's voice has now gone off key, floating carefree, drifting drifting away. rothchild chuckles, philosophically. the doors in control booth start leaving. robbie goes back out to get his personal items. but the overdub still plays over the booth as jim doesn't realize. we take liberties cutting around on the song.}
<D>__{jim & doors all our lives we sweat and save building for a shallow grave}

<C>__{jim song}
<P>__{(fiercely) calling on the dogs (5)}
<D>__{when all else fails you can whip the horses' eyes and make them sleep and cry.}
<A>__{the music stops. silence. inside the booth, two shadows breathe deep, huddled on the floor in each other's arms. a whisper out of the dark.}
<C>__{pam}
<D>__{i love you.}
