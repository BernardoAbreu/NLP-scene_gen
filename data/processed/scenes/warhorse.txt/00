<A>__{the bucolic magnificence of the devon countryside. we fly low over the high, thick hedges untouched for hundreds of years. the thick verdant countryside in all its splendor, ancient woodlands, fields of corn, and finally a paddock in a typical devonshire dale. we come to rest beside three farmers standing over a pregnant mare. the mare is in distress she is about to give birth. the farmers calm the mare and tend to her gently with assurance and authority. we pull back to see, albert, a fifteen year old farm boy, watching the whole drama with delight from the paddock gate.}

<D>__{there we go. who's a clever girl?}
<A>__{moments later the summer's sun glints off the wet, sticky hide of the foal (joey) red hide, four white socks and a distinctive white cross on its forehead. soon the creature is attempting its first clumsy steps. it is both awesome and comical to see the new born creature struggle to his feet, but eventually, he succeeds. title: war horse}
