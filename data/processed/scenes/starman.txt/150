<A>__{the star man moves jenny into a rectangle of moonlight shaped on the floor by a high, wide window and strips off her blouse. the cold light marbles jenny's skin and makes the blood from her wounds appear black. with her blouse, the star man wipes away the blood on the right side of her head and neck. he finds a deep glass cut on her cheek and two entry points in her neck. he concentrates on her cheek and we can see the glow of his brain through his human skin. a bit of the white light comes out of his forehead. it tumbles across to jenny's cheek and settles into the wound. the star man watches intently as one end of the wound flares brightly for an instant, then dies. the flesh left behind has been closed without a scar. a larger piece of light drops out of his forehead into what's left of the gash. with that area suffused in a healing glow, he shifts his focus to the pellet holes on her neck. he sends two pieces of light plunging into the wounds. immediately, they spread into halos which we can see radiating from under the skin. out of the night comes a long blast on the air horn and the star man has to steady jenny as the truck swerves around something in the highway. when it settles back into its ride, the star man wipes the blood off jenny's shoulder. the beams of the passing cars through the plastic catch the fatigue on the star man's face as he works over jenny.}
