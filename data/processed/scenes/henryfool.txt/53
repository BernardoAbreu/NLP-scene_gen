<L>__{interior the grim house kitchen day}
<A>__{the next day. fay is frying something on the stove, a cigarette hangs from her lip. a middle aged woman with a press id on her lapel appears at the kitchen door and taps.}
<C>__{edna}
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{fay}
<D>__{yeah, i'm listening.}
<C>__{edna}
<D>__{my name is edna rodriguez and i write the human interest column for the queens county examiner and i was just wondering if i could have a word with simon grim?}
<A>__{intrigued, fay steps over to the door with her spatula. she looks edna over, studies her id, then steps away and screams upstairs.}
<C>__{fay}
<D>__{simon!}
<C>__{edna}
<P>__{(startled)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{fay comes back over near the door, waving her spatula.}
<C>__{fay}
<D>__{you can't talk to him for, you know, too long or anything, 'cause he's gotta, you know... he writes all day. that's all he does. can you believe that?}
<A>__{no response.}
<C>__{fay}
<P>__{(calling again)}
<D>__{hey! simon! get down here!}
<A>__{simon finally shuffles into the kitchen.}
<C>__{fay}
<D>__{simon, this is edna. she's from the newspaper.}
<C>__{edna}
<P>__{(rapid fire)}
<D>__{simon, the parents' association at the local high school are calling your poem pornography. the teachers are defending the students' right to exercise their critical tastes and sensibilities. the county agrees with the church and considers the poem emblematic of modern society's moral disintegration. how do you feel about these controversial reactions to your poem?}
<A>__{simon says nothing. he just stares at her.}
<C>__{fay}
<P>__{(punching him)}
<D>__{simon, answer the woman.}
<A>__{simon just looks away, thinks, then wanders back upstairs. mary passes him on his way out of the kitchen and comes up to fay and edna at the door.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i need my prescription filled.}
<C>__{fay}
<D>__{mom, this is edna. edna, mom.}
<C>__{edna}
<D>__{mrs grim, what was simon like as a child?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{we all thought he was retarded.}
<C>__{fay}
<D>__{everyone did.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{never said a word.}
<C>__{fay}
<D>__{he masturbated constantly.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{had no friends.}
<C>__{fay}
<D>__{till he met henry.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{and that's when all the trouble really started.}
