<L>__{interior old farmhouse kitchen night}
<A>__{grace takes a glock from her pocket and sets it on the counter. she pours water into a kettle. puts the kettle on the stove. turns on the stove. grace notices water on the kitchen floor. wait. wet footprints. grace reacts. reaches for the glock. a hand lands on top of her hand. it's martin asher.}
<C>__{asher}
<D>__{hi, grace.}
<A>__{click! he snaps a handcuff around grace's wrist. asher has the upper hand, he spins her, pulls her down into a chair. she throws a punch. asher blocks it. asher yanks on her cuffed arm. smack! grace slaps him. asher pulls her into a chair. click! grace is now cuffed to the chair. she struggles futilely against the cuffs. asher catches his breath.}
<C>__{asher}
<D>__{knock it off. you're not going anywhere.}
<A>__{grace stop struggling. asher looking at her huge belly.}
<C>__{asher}
<D>__{i'm not going to hurt you.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you're so full of shit your eyes turned brown.}
<A>__{asher is happy to see her.}
<C>__{asher}
<D>__{they're contacts. you're glowing.}
<A>__{grace looking at him. still astonished to see him. her arms behind her back, her belly is so vulnerable.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{how the fuck did you find me?}
<C>__{asher}
<D>__{you told me everything i had to know.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{get it over with. just get it over with.}
<C>__{asher}
<D>__{ever since i met you, you're all i can think about. i had a way of life. and i can't go back to because of you. i want you in my life, grace. please listen to me, grace. i have a proposal.}
<A>__{asher takes out a couple passports, a pair of driver's licenses.}
<C>__{asher}
<D>__{you become her. i become him. we are married, see?}
<A>__{asher slides a woman's wedding ring across the table. already inscribed.}
<C>__{asher}
<D>__{we have the babies. we raise them. however you want. i just want to be with you.}
<A>__{grace looking at asher, not sure whether to laugh out loud or start crying. he seems edgy; he needs her decision quick.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{what happens if i don't want to assume this woman's identity and raise my babies with a serial killer?}
<C>__{asher}
<D>__{grace, don't be morbid. if anyone can deal with this, you can. i know you felt what i felt. it's real.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{answer my question.}
<C>__{asher}
<D>__{i will shoot you in the head and burn this place down.}
<A>__{grace reacts. she can respect that. grace looking at asher. he's scary, feeding off some fantasy about her.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you'll do what you have to do. i can respect that. how do you know it's still real? maybe it's gone. what we felt.}
<A>__{grace tilts her lips, looking in his eyes. asher leans over to kiss her. slow, delicate. asher kneels beside her, the kisses become hungry, desperate. grace's eyes are so open, so vulnerable.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{god, i missed you so much.}
<A>__{asher leans in to kiss her... grace head butts him. crunch! smashes his nose. she drives her feet down and her shoulder into his chest. asher, already on his knees, falls back. grace scrambles over him, gets out of the chair. she shoulders over the kitchen table... there is a holster mounted underneath the table. grace turns her back so she can grab the gun from it. grace reacts. there is no gun in the holster. asher looking at her, matter of fact:}
<C>__{asher}
<D>__{i searched everything.}
<A>__{asher stands, reaches for the glock on the counter. grace can't let him get it. she lunges at asher, collides into his knees, hurting him.}
<C>__{asher}
<D>__{damn you!}
<A>__{asher grabs a large knife from the butcher's block. thwack! plunges it into grace's belly. grace gasps, looking at the knife embedded in her stomach. a beat as grace and asher stare at the knife. grace uses the pause to kick away from asher. she gets on her feet and runs from the kitchen.}
