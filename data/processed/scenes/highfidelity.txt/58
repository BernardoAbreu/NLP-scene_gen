<L>__{exterior record store day}
<A>__{rob emerges behind them, vince's skateboard in hand. they have enough distance to bolt, but they can't leave that board behind.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{okay, fuckos. how much is this deck worth to you, and how many cd's did you rip off? can you do the math?}
<A>__{justin pulls two cd's out and slides them over to rob.}
<C>__{rob}
<P>__{(to vince)}
<D>__{and what about you, dork?}
<A>__{vince pulls about six, and puts them down in a neutral spot. rob picks all of them up and starts looking through them. dicks pokes his head out of the door.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{dick, call the police, please.}
<A>__{vince and justin look at each other.}
<C>__{rob}
<P>__{(looking through the cd's)}
<D>__{eno import. sigue sigue sputnik. break beats. serge gainsbourg. ryuchi sakamoto, syd barrett... what's going on here? are you guys stealing for other people now?}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{naw. those are for us.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{oh really. you two are slamming to nico now?}
<C>__{justin}
<D>__{you're, like, so bigoted to look at us and, like, think you know what we listen to.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{you got the cd's so can i have my board back?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i think you have more.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{well we don't.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i can't frisk you but the cops can.}
<A>__{justin reaches down again into his baggy shorts and comes up with a tattered old book, "how to make a record." he tosses it over.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{jesus. that thing's been in the bargain bin for six months! was it just your criminal nature or what? hell, i would've given it to you for free.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{no, we...}
<C>__{justin}
<D>__{we don't know how it works. nobody even knows, so we wanted to check it out in that mag.}
<A>__{rob snorts.}
<C>__{justin}
<D>__{like, do you know how to actually make a cd?}
<A>__{rob can't resist edifying them the curse of the underappreciated expert.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{uh, yes i, like, do... it's simple. you make the tracks recording studio deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. you press the cd's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{records are those big round black things, right?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{fuck off.}
<A>__{rob turns to go back in the store.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{hey, can i have my board?}
<A>__{rob drops it and enters the store.}
