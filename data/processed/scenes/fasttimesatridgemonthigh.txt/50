<A>__{he arrives back in his room and locks the door. he yanks the burger picture off his wall, dumps it into the trash. then he takes it back out of the trash and cracks the cardboard picture and plastic frame in half.}

<A>__{we are in the middle of a deep, dark void. after a moment, a pinprick of light appears in the distance. we head towards the light. we are being led somewhere important. as we draw still closer, curtains suddenly part to reveal a wildly cheering studio audience. we hear the voice of merv griffin.}

<D>__{will you please give a warm welcome to... jeff spicoli!}
<A>__{the merv griffin show band begins playing a merv griffin show version of ac dc's "highway to hell". someone hands jeff spicoli a microphone. he works the studio audience into a frenzy as he sings the words to "highway to hell": merv griffin show style.}

<D>__{'layin' ladies! drinkin' wine! you gotta dollar you're a friend of mine! gettin' loose! feelin' fine! you and me it's get down time! we're on the highway to hell! the highway to hell!'}
<A>__{spicoli finishes up with a spectular pump. the audience goes wild as merv griffin greets him warmly, and guides spicoli to his seat. spicoli motions for the cheers to die down. griffin is obviously happy to see him. he touches spicoli's arm lightly.}

<C>__{griffin}
<D>__{how often do you go?}
<C>__{spicoli}
<D>__{i don't go at all.}
