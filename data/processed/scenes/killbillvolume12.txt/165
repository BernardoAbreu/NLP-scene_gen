<L>__{interior motel room bathroom morning}
<A>__{the bride is on the floor of the motel room bathroom, crying her eyes out. she shoves a towel in her mouth so b.b. won't hear her. we wonder for a moment what's wrong... till we see her face in cu... her tears are tears of joy. she can't believe this is even happening. her daughter is alive. they're together. they get to begin again. she covers her mouth so b.b. won't hear her crying and get worried or confused. but as the deadliest woman on the planet, lies on the motel room bathroom floor, smile on her face, twinkle in her eyes, happier than she's ever been, she thinks one thought. over and over again.... thank you god...thank you god...thank you god...thank you god. she washes her face in the sink, when she's presentable, she walks out of the bathroom, jumps on the bed with her baby, hugs her from behind as the two watch saturday morning cartoons.}
