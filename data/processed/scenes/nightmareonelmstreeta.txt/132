<A>__{angle on marge as she checks the lock on the backdoor. firm. angle in the living room as she pads through the darkened house, feels her way to a wall of shelves and takes down a book. then another, and a third. then reaches in and fishes out a bottle of gin.}
<L>__{exterior nancy's house and elm street. night.}
<A>__{the sky has gathered in greater darkness. low, distant thunder rolls around the horizon like a great drum. angle on nancy's house from across the street. the moon glints off the barred windows. camera zooms to nancy's window. the imprisoned girl hovers in the darkness behind the grill like a ghost, her eyes turned towards glen's. then she switches to something much closer to camera angle, and she draws back. reverse on glen's father, standing on the front porch of his home, also in the shadows, looking straight across and up at nancy. he draws on his cigarette; his face glows red. nancy pulls down the shade. glen's father grinds the cigarette beneath his shoe.}
