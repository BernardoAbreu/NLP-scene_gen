<C>__{williamson}
<D>__{maybe they ate it.}
<A>__{the cops giggle at this.}
<C>__{williamson}

<A>__{with the detectives gone, speedy turns up his nose and waves the air, fanning away a bad smell.}
<C>__{speedy}
<D>__{whew. you know, it's not some old wives' tale about blind people having an acute sense of smell.}
