<L>__{exterior work area day}
<B>__{establishing shot of dark brown liquid being poured into a large pit.}
<A>__{drew is walking with li, having just dumped their buckets into a large hole.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{so what is this 'night soil' stuff anyway?}
<C>__{li}
<D>__{human waste.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{oh, man! you guys actually use this as fertilizer? that's disgusting!}
<A>__{they turn to go back, and there is gao, balancing a huge basket of night soil over his head, peasant style. he is on the same ridge that they are going to walk on.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{hi, gao. how you doing?}
<C>__{gao}
<P>__{(a little worried)}
<D>__{let me pass.}
<A>__{he reaches down and plucks a stick out of the earth at his feet, and then closes on gao a little bit.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{there's something on the bottom of your basket.}
<A>__{drew pokes at the basket for a moment, right over gao's head. then, he jams the stick in, and holds it there.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{oops! i think i found the problem.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{a hole.}
<A>__{drew pulls the stick out and watches as the night soil cascades down onto gao's head. they back away as gao goes running towards the pit where the night soil is deposited.}
<C>__{drew }
<P>__{(to li)}
<D>__{well, somebody sure smells!}
