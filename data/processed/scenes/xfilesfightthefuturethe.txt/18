<L>__{interior snack area and soda vending machine room day}
<A>__{mulder takes a few steps down into the windowless room. moving past the snack machines to a lighted soda machine. finding the correct change and plunking it in. hitting a button, but... nothing comes out.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{oh, come on.}
<A>__{he beats his fist a couple of times on the front of the machine. nothing. he finds more change. plunking it in. hits the button. nothing. he stares at the machine a minute, then beats it hard with his fist. nothing. moving around to the back of the machine, looking for:}
<B>__{angle across back of machine}
<A>__{mulder's face peering in on the slim space between the machine and the wall. reaching down and lifting the plug on the end of the electrical cord. it isn't plugged in. realizing now why the machine hasn't spit out his sodas.}
<B>__{resume front angle on machine}
<A>__{as mulder appears, stepping very lightly in front of the machine that he was just pounding away on. looking at it, then moving quickly to the door he entered through. grasping the knob, but finding it... locked. he jiggles the knob, pulls on it. but there's no two ways about it, he's locked in.}
