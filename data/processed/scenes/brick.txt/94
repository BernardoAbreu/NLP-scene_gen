<L>__{exterior locker cage morning}
<A>__{the class bell rings, and the cage quickly empties. brendan limps in, opens his locker. a note falls to his feet. it is folded into a star. he pulls it open. "twelve thirty pico & alexander". he fishes the old note out and compares them different handwriting. the locker cage is now empty and silent, except for the steady sound of heavy footfalls. brendan looks up from the notes. a lug with a lumpish face is coming towards him. he wears a black trenchcoat over bulbous shoulders, and his black hair comes down over his eyes like a sheepdog's.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{you the pin's?}
<A>__{no answer. the lug keeps coming.}
<C>__{brendan }
<D>__{so what's his answer?}
<A>__{closer, not slowing. brendan tightens his hand into a fist. then click! and a long slender switchblade gleams in the lug's right paw. brendan jumps back as the lug swipes the blade at his torso. before the lug winds up for another slash brendan is running.}
