<L>__{exterior studio lot day}
<A>__{elaine and viktor talk in the shadow of an enormous soundstage. they speak more freely in each other's company.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{god, viktor. why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{difficult. i'm difficult.}
<A>__{he produces a handful of candy from his pocket.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(referring to the candy)}
<D>__{ do you know what these are, elaine?}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(talking a piece of candy and eating it)}
<D>__{hmm... mike and ike's.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{not just any mike & ike's cherry mike & ike's. do you know why i, viktor taransky, two time academy award nominated director }
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{ viktor, that was short subject.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{ overseeing the most cherished movie project of my career, am walking around with a pocketful of cherry mike & ike's?}
<A>__{elaine takes a seat in a nearby studio cart as viktor paces.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{ i have a feeling you're going to tell me.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{ i will tell you why. it is because miss nicola anders, supermodel with a sag card god's gift to cinema, has it written into her contract that all cherry mike & ike's be removed from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into should have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three of them opened, that there be a personal jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room, and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first class.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{ what's wrong with that?}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{elaine, she doesn't have any children!}
<P>__{(grabbing her arm)}
<D>__{don't you see? we're being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone somewhere has decreed are the a list.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{the public decides who's on that list.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{please.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{it's the truth. those 17 superstars are our insurance policy. we can't open can't make a profit without them.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{we can hardly make a profit with them. up front salary, back end deal, perks, per diem, percentages they're mocking us, elaine. we're at their mercy.}
<P>__{(staring wistful, into space)}
<D>__{we always had movie stars but they used to be our stars. we used to decide who would play what role. we told them what to wear, what to say, who to date. when they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to more than once!}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(regarding him as if he's insane)}
<D>__{you realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(irritated at her infuriating logic)}
<D>__{well, i do remember why i started out in this business you seem to have forgotten working in new york with cassevetes we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema }
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(rolling her eyes)}
<D>__{ it's called a projector.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(ignoring her)}
<D>__{ illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{listen, viktor, i have good memories of those days too but this isn't about that or you or me or some high minded ideal. this is business.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{spare me.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(gesturing at the studio lot)}
<D>__{ christ, viktor, look around. what do you think pays for all this? this is about investment and return. those days in new york... that's... it's over.}
<A>__{a pause. viktor reads elaine's face.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{you're not renewing my contract.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{how can i? your last three pictures tanked. the board is giving me hell. no bankable star will work with you after this. if you just compromised... a little.}
<A>__{viktor eats some of the candy in his hand as he takes in the news.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(rueful smile)}
<D>__{ well, it's not every day you're fired by the mother of your own child.}
<A>__{elaine also eats some more candy a curiously intimate moment between them.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(softening, a heart to heart)}
<D>__{i'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal. you and i both know, after the divorce i kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of lainey. i called what's his name at warner's. he said he'd take a meeting in july. i've fought for you viktor...}
<P>__{(voice trails off)}
<D>__{you want to talk severance?}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(staring off into the distance, face hardening)}
<D>__{you can have everything office, car, assistants all i want is the picture.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{the picture's dead.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{so there's no problem i can have the rights, the negative too?}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(believing she's getting off lightly)}
<D>__{they're yours. but how are you going to finish it? without a star there's no movie.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{i don't need a star. all i need is an actor i will reshoot the part, cut out nicola and replace her with a real actor. a real leading lady.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{even if you find her, you know the problem with unknowns, viktor. if they're good, they get known. and then you're back to sorting their candy... and worse.}
<P>__{(kissing him on the cheek}
<D>__{as she departs in her}
<P>__{studio golf cart)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, viktor.}
<A>__{viktor watches her depart down the canyon of stages, left alone on the deserted lot.}
