<A>__{travelling a narrow path. along the side of a steep mountain. the tank moves upward. toward the mountain top. the tank jerks. wobbles. it's as if the driver were having trouble with the controls.}
<L>__{interior tank}
<A>__{indiana drives. unfamiliar with the controls. the tank is crowded with everyone. betsy and clare sit beside indy. gutterbuhg is directly behind him. kezure teaches a game to scraggy. tyki, the pirates and the various crew members watch. the game appears to be a bizarre version of chess. only the tokens are dried insects and lizards. kezure explains.}

<D>__{this is called "taskipi". only the bravest play.}
<A>__{upon hearing this, scraggy is even more excited to play. the game}

<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{since when did you become the female sigmund freud?}

<D>__{since i received a masters degree in psychology.}
<A>__{indy rolls his eyes. meanwhile, kezure has taken all of scraggy's tokens. he's obviously won the game. a carefree scraggy throws up his hands.}
<C>__{scraggy}
<D>__{we play again?}
<C>__{kezure}
<P>__{(pause, serious)}
<D>__{the game is not yet over, my friend.}

<A>__{scraggy gulps. kezure pauses. rubbing his jaw. thinking. meanwhile, betsy explains to indians.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{dr. clarke says that you're not really in love with me. you're just trying to prove that you can still attract younger women. you're terrified of getting old.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{that's crazy.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{that's what i told her. i told her that you really did love me.}
<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(fumbling)}
<D>__{well...that's...ah...well...}

<C>__{betsy}
<P>__{(tears fill her eyes)}
<D>__{that's the first time you ever said it!}
<A>__{betsy begins crying. into clare's arms. indiana shakes his head. clare comforts betsy.}
<C>__{clare}
<D>__{there. there. he's a very disturbed man.}
<A>__{indiana sighs. he turns. face to face with a grinning and nodding gutterbuhg. kezure has made his decision. scraggy waits. terrified. kezure raises his knife. toward scraggy's face.}
<C>__{kezure}
<D>__{your eyes. they are a striking deep blue.}
<A>__{scraggy covers his face. kezure attacks him. trying to cut out: scraggy's eyes. a fight begins. the crew members vs. the pirates. indiana turns, away from the controls. he breaks up the fight.}
<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{enough. we're in this together. if we start fighting among ourselves... we'll never get out alive.}
<A>__{the men calm down. catching their breath. kezure puts away his knife. he glares at scraggy.}
<C>__{kezure}
<D>__{you owe me, old man.}
