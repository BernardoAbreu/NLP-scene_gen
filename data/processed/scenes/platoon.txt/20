<A>__{a piece of an old buddhist temple, under a sulky moonlight now in a state of decay, the jungle surging to engulf it. the men are setting up quickly and relatively quietly in the ruins alongside a miniscule trail. the rain is coming down harder than ever. chris and tex setting out their claymore mines, raveling back their detonating cords to their position, drenched. in the far distance, an illumination round brightens the sky for a brief moment. various ad lib curses and directions are lost in the sound of the rain.}
