<L>__{interior car late afternoon}
<A>__{jacob is hustled to a waiting car and shoved inside, in between two officious looking men. the doors lock from the driver's command.}
<D>__{army official #1 mr. singer. what an appropriate name for a man who can't keep his mouth shut.}
<A>__{the car drives off.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{who are you? what do you want? army official #2 we've been watching you for a long time. you and your friends. you've been exhibiting some very odd behavior. frightening people with foolish talk about demons and experiments.}
<A>__{jacob tries to speak but the other man grabs his mouth.}
<D>__{army official #1 you're in over your head, mr. singer. men drown that way. the army was another part of your life. forget it. it is dead and buried. let it lie. army official #2 i hope we have made our point, mr. singer.}
<A>__{jacob stares at the men for a moment and then goes totally berserk. letting out a howl, he begins pounding and thrashing like a madman. he is totally out of control. with a wild leap, he grabs for the door handle. the door flies open. it flaps back and forth, slamming into parked cars. jacob tries to jump out, but the men yank him back in. one of them pulls out a gun. jacob sees it and goes crazy. his feet kick in all directions, slamming the driver's nose into the steering wheel and shattering the side window. the car careens around a corner sending the gun flying to the floor. the men dive for it. it lodges beneath the seat. in the mayhem, jacob throws himself out of the flapping door and sprawls onto the pavement. people look down at him as the car speeds away.}
