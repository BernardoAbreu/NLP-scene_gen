<L>__{exterior meadow night}
<A>__{full shot. the three men ride along the trail toward the camp. through the trees the campfire flickers.}
<L>__{exterior fowler's camp night}
<A>__{med. shot. fowler is putting the supper dishes up on the shelves beside the fireplace. the camp is cleaner than it was earlier in the day. it is evident that he has gone to great pains to make his visitor comfortable. a mirror has been tacked up on a tree, and under it is a wash basin. fowler's rifle and shotgun are in a rack near the fireplace. helen's trunk stands open near the lean to. helen, wearing a robe, takes some clothing from it, closes the trunk.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{you can put this out of the way, jed. it's empty.}
<A>__{fowler turns and smiles. helen pushes through the curtains into the lean to. fowler puts the last of the dishes on the shelf, crosses to the trunk and moves it over to the side of the lean to. turning to go back to the fireplace, he stops.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{fowler in the f.g. lednov, rifle in hand, stands just inside the camp on the meadow side.}
<C>__{fowler}
<P>__{(turning slowly)}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<A>__{lednov moves slowly forward to stand near the table. he looks around him. fowler starts slowly toward the fireplace.}
<C>__{lednov}
<D>__{i saw your fire and dropped by to say hello.}
<C>__{fowler}
<D>__{well, say it.}
<A>__{trying to be casual, fowler moves closer to where the guns are racked.}
<C>__{lednov}
<D>__{what's the matter restless?}
<C>__{fowler}
<D>__{yes, people make me restless.}
<C>__{lednov}
<D>__{even women?}
<C>__{fowler}
<D>__{there aren't any women here.}
<C>__{lednov}
<D>__{i suppose that's your wagon in the river.}
<C>__{fowler}
<D>__{some people who went by this way lost it.}
<P>__{(nervously)}
<D>__{two men and some women. they packed their stuff on horses and went on.}
<C>__{lednov}
<D>__{and you're all alone.}
<C>__{fowler}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{he has edged closer to the gun rack. lednov seems unaware that he is near the guns. his interest is centered on the lean to. he moves to the entrance, stands with his hand on the canvas.}
<C>__{lednov}
<D>__{suppose i take a look.}
<C>__{fowler}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<A>__{lednov pulls back the flap. his back is to fowler, who starts quickly for the tree, only to stop as mccall comes out from behind it.}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{looking for something?}
<A>__{fowler drops his hands to his side. lednov turns, grins at fowler, and enters the lean to.}
