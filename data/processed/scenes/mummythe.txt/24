<L>__{exterior giant sand dune endless horizon day}
<A>__{the dawning sun hasn't yet crested the distant horizon as jonathan and the warden ride alongside a giant sand dune.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{and you snore!}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{i do not snore!}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{all night you snored!}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{i have never snored!}
<A>__{up in front of them, o'connell looks at evelyn.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{we're almost there.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{are you sure?}
<A>__{o'connell looks down at the ground.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{pretty sure.}
<A>__{the others look down and see dozens of skeletons sticking out of the ground. bleached and eaten away. some of the skeletons look like they're trying to crawl up out of the desert floor.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{what in bloody hell is this?}
<A>__{the warden shivers in fear.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{other seekers of hamunaptra.}
<A>__{the american expedition rides out from behind the far end of the dune. the americans are accompanied by two dozen native diggers and an arab egyptologist. beni rides lead on a camel, the rest ride horses.}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{good morning, my friend!}
<A>__{o'connell just nods. the two parties come to a stop a hundred feet apart. o'connell turns and stares out across the endless horizon. beni does likewise. the americans look puzzled.}
<C>__{daniels}
<D>__{well, what the hell we doin'?}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{patience, my good sahib, patience.}
<A>__{henderson looks over at o'connell.}
<C>__{henderson}
<D>__{first one to the city, o'connell! five hundred! cash bucks!}
<A>__{o'connell and beni just stare out at the flat nothingness. evelyn and jonathan share a look. and then, the sun starts to rise in the distance, breaking the flat horizon.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{get ready.}
<A>__{evelyn can feel the suspense and the majesty of the moment.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{we're about to be shown the way.}
<A>__{far off to the right, a huge shape begins to rise with the sun. a volcano. o'connell and beni watch it, expressionless. daniels, henderson and burns share a look, and then }
<D>__{daniels henderson burns heya!}
<A>__{the americans take off. racing towards the rising volcano.}
<C>__{daniels}
<D>__{see ya there, o'connell!}
<A>__{evelyn and jonathan give o'connell anxious, sarcastic looks.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{after all, you rode us night and day to win that bet.}
<A>__{o'connell doesn't say a word, staring hard. beni watches the americans and spits into the sand.}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{fools.}
<A>__{and then suddenly, the volcano shifts across the horizon. passing across the sun as it goes. it's a mirage. the americans crash their horses to a stop and race the other way, after the volcano. evelyn and jonathan smile, amazed. the volcano shifts again, floating across the watery horizon. the americans crash to a stop again and chase after the volcano. all three of them confused and cursing. o'connell and beni just stare, waiting. the volcano shifts again. and the americans crash to a stop again. burns is thrown from his horse. henderson angrily rips his hat off and chucks it to the ground. daniels just curses as they give up the chase. the volcano comes to a stop on the far left of the horizon. the americans are on the far right. nothing moves. a beat. and then o'connell grins. so does beni. they share a look. and then swat their camels and race away. everybody else hauls ass after them. o'connell and beni are neck and neck. and then evelyn comes galloping up, hair flying in the wind. beni takes out his camel whip and starts whipping o'connell. trying to knock him off his camel. once. crack! twice. crack! but on the third try o'connell grabs the whip and jerks beni off his camel. beni slams to the ground and tumbles. evelyn and o'connell race across the desert. evelyn has never felt so alive. she laughs. o'connell grins; he likes this girl. beni stumbles to his feet, then quickly dances out of the way as jonathan and all the other riders stampede past him. evelyn beats o'connell to the stone ramp, racing hard.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{evelyn! slow down!}
<A>__{evelyn ignores him as she races up the ramp towards the gate.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{slow down, evelyn! slow down! there's a really big }
