<D>__{what can we do, richie? you don't want to do this. for old times sake, what can we do? who do you want? who can i give you? you want big sal's bookie? you want his accountant? i will give him to you.}
<A>__{richie regards him a moment. a policy ring's accountant wouldn't be bad. he glances back to his paramedic dabbing at his bloody hand, and notices she's not bad looking. she smiles back.}
