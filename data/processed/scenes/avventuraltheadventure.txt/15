<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{the first shadows of evening begin to fall over the island of lisca bianca. the sky is now even gloomier, streaked with flashes of lightning. rumbling sounds of thunder are heard in the distance. the entire group is once again reunited on the beach, and the impending storm has heightened their fears and anxiety. they are cold, restless, and exhausted, but profoundly moved and shaken by the reality of anna's strange disappearance.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{let's try to be practical about this. the best thing to do is for all of you to go to the closest island that has a police station, or something, and report the disappearance. i will remain here... because... well, i don't know, but it seems to me that something may turn up. anyway, i just don't feel like leaving.}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{then let's get started... it's senseless to waste any more time.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<P>__{(to the sailor)}
<D>__{how long will it take to go there and come back?}
<C>__{sailor}
<D>__{if there's a police station at panarea, it should take us a couple of hours. but if we have to go to lipari, it will take much longer. then it also depends on how rough the sea is.}
<A>__{giulia is about to get on her way but she stops and turns around to look for corrado, who notices her looking at him.}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{i will stay here also.}
<C>__{giulia}
<P>__{(alarmed)}
<D>__{but why?... what if it starts to rain?}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{if it rains, i will buy myself an umbrella.}
<A>__{claudia, who has remained to one side, wrapped up in her own thoughts, doesn't make a move to leave. sandro and corrado look at her in surprise.}
<C>__{corrado}
<P>__{(to claudia, understandingly)}
<D>__{claudia, i know how you feel, but there are already two of us staying...}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{i will go even further and say that her presence here i don't want to sound offensive could be a great hindrance.}
<A>__{ignoring sandro's remark, claudia turns and determinedly heads towards the interior of the island. meanwhile, patrizia and giulia have gone aboard the yacht.}
<C>__{giulia}
<P>__{(calling to corrado from the boat)}
<D>__{do you want some blankets? ... and something to eat?}
<A>__{corrado makes an irritated gesture signifying no, then together with sandro starts climbing up the rocky slope towards the stone hut. as they meet up with claudia midway, the first drops of rain start to fall and it is clear that the storm is on the verge of breaking. the three of them reach the door of the hut and corrado tries to pull it open, but the lock resists. then sandro comes to his aid, and placing their shoulders up against the wooden door, they finally manage to force it open.}
