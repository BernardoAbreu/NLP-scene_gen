<A>__{on a back route to north l.a. a handful of local truckers hunch over chili sizes, cat hats pushed back on their heads. three bikers are playing a game of pool in the back, their miller empties lining the table's rail. the dive's owner, lloyd, a fat, aging biker type in a soiled apron, stands behind the bar. nothing much going on... then the front door opens and a big naked guy strolls in that doesn't happen every night. all eyes simultaneously swivel toward terminator. its emotionless gaze passes over the customers as it walks calmly through the room. everyone frozen, not sure how to react.}
