<A>__{rose walks through the shadows of the deck machinery. her nightgown blows in the wind. her feet are bare. her hands are clutched at her chest, almost as if she is praying. on lovett and lizzy running down the stairs from the top deck, hauling ass. rose reaches the sern rail. her gnarled fingers wrap over the rail. her ancient foot steps up on the gunwale. she pushes herself up, leaning forward. over her shoulder, we see the black water glinting far below. lovett and lizzy run up behind her.}

<A>__{grandma, wait!! don't rose turns her head, looking at them. she turns further, and we see she has something in her hand, something she was about to drop overboard. it is the "heart of the ocean". lovett sees his holy grail in her hand and his eyes go wide. rose keeps it over the railing where she can drop it anytime.}
