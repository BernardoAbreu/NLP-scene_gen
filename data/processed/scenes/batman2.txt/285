<A>__{the penguin and vicki are on a catwalk just below the rock formation. a stone outcropping extends toward the catwalk, and he forces her to jump for it. now he has to follow; the prospect makes him nervous, but it's a short hop, and he clears it okay finding his footing on the rocky slope. they're cautiously making their way up toward the rock formation when batman appears suddenly at the far end of the catwalk sizes up the situation and freezes in his tracks.}

<D>__{you've been an exceptionally congenial host but i must ask you to back off.}

<D>__{no sudden moves. it's a long way down.}
<A>__{gun at her head, he peers into the grotto... his pov inside the grotto a vast fortune in gold and silver bullion, undisturbed in all these years. glinting in the darkness. hanging upside down, above it, like silent guardians, are bats dozens of them their tiny wet red eyes glimmering at the penguin... he dislodges a rock. it tumbles into the grotto... ...and a startled bat comes screeching out of the gap in the rocks flying directly at his face. angle on rocks penguin and vicki he backs away in horror as the bat streaks past him. he fires his gun wildly. the sound of it rouses more bats, and they come flying out of the hole a vast, chittering swarm. vicki shrieks; the penguin stumbles and the two of them fall back onto the rocks, hanging on for dear life.}

<A>__{an instant later batman lets fly with the batarang. clean hit; the penguin staggers back, and his gun skitters down across the rocks. with bats screaming all around her, vicki takes a deep breath and vaults toward the catwalk. she's a foot short; she grabs hold of the railing and hangs there, over the abyss, trying to pull herself up. batman races toward her but the penguin, clambering down across the rocky outcropping, has managed to grab hold of his gun. the bats have begun to swirl up toward the higher recesses of the cavern, and he's able to draw a clean bead on batman. thunderous echoes reverberate through the cave as the first shot strikes batman and knocks him backward. as the second spins him around. as the third sends him toppling over the}

<A>__{vicki screams. batman manages to grab the rail with one hand. now two of them are hanging from the catwalk sitting ducks and the penguin is determined to empty the clip. the echoes are cacophanous. ancient stalactites drop from the vaulted roof of the cavern, plummeting downward like deadly projectiles, shattering agaist the cave floor. and then batman pulls a tiny device from his utility belt and flings it. it lands in the rocks at the penguin's feet. he stares down at it, and two beats later it begins to emit an eerie electronic whine. within moments, every bat in the cave is in a frenzy homing in on the signal. the penguin looks up sees them coming. a choked wail emits from his throat as he drops the gun and stands there, paralyzed. he's just been beaten at his own game. he lets out a last awful howl as hundreds of bats engulf him and he plunges down into the pit his hideous scream dwindling to a faint echo, then vanishing altogether... batman manages to drag himself up onto the catwalk. he rushes over to vicki, pulls her up, drapes his cape around her protectively. gradually, as the bats recede to their distant perches, he stands and helps vicki to her feet. they embrace on the edge of the abyss. on the far plateau, dick has hooked up with alfred. the butler is slumped against a lab table, weary and exhausted, clutching his wounded arm. dick slings an arm around him and helps him to the stairway.}
