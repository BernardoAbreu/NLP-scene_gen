<A>__{wind blows fiercely as pellets of hail bounce off the ground. rain cuts at a sharp angle. the tornado sirens continue. curtis, hannah in his arms and samantha close behind, exits the back of the house and heads to the storm shelter. he passes hannah to samantha and fumbles with the padlock keys. at the doors to the shelter, samantha holds her robe up to shield hannah from the hail. curtis gets the lock and opens the door. they go inside.}
