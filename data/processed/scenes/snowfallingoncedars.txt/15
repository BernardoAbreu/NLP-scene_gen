<D>__{...so when the sheriff returned, you showed him the injury to the deceased's head.}
<C>__{whaley}
<D>__{he said, 'could it be somebody hit him?' and i said, 'you want to play sherlock holmes, here?'}

<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{did you say more?}
<C>__{whaley}
<D>__{i said that if i was playing sherlock holmes...i'd maybe look for a... japanese person. with a bloody gun butt. a right handed fella, to be precise.}

<A>__{slight shrug.}
<C>__{whaley}
<D>__{well, i was a doctor in the jap theater, in the war. i saw those kendo wounds, many times. looked exactly like this one.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{could you tell me what 'kendo' is?}
<C>__{whaley}
<D>__{japanese stick fighting. they're trained as kids, y'know. to kill with sticks.}
