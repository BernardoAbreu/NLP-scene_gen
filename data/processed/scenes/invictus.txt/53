<A>__{a huge, raucous crowd, almost entirely white and male. many wearing the springbok green and gold. widespread evidence of drinking. lots of old south african flags the blue, white and orange apartheid flag make a defiant statement against the new south african flags ringing the stadium. on the field, the rugby teams assemble and face each other in two lines. the british lions in their white on white with black and red trim, the springboks in their green and gold. like their supporters, the springboks are all white, but for one man, who is "colored" (mixed race). big, tough, brutal looking men. scary. (we may or may not notice francois pienaar, standing at the head of the line of springboks.)}
