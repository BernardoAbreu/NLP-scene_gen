<A>__{austin is reading a schematic diagram as he sits in front of the exposed chassis of a complicated futuristic electronic contraption, twice his size. there are strange tools all over the floor. putting down the diagram, he opens one of the metal cases and takes out a sophisticated looking glass sphere with electronic receptacles mounted in the sides. he places this sphere in a space in the middle of the contraption, clamps it down, and plugs some wires into the globe's receptacles. then he opens the second box. inside is a glowing green ball. using a pair of special tongs, austin carefully lifts the ball out, and inserts it into an opening at the base of the machine, in the back. as soon as the ball is inside, the machine hums to life. the glass sphere sparkles, and a holographic picture of a green planet in space appears inside it.}
