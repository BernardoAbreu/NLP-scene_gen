<L>__{exterior courthouse parking lot day}
<A>__{the cruiser pulls into a fenced and gated parking lot. gordon, castro and ruiz, walking with a limp, cross to the building entrance. as they push inside, francisco flores, in a conservative grey suit passes them going outside. the parking lot is empty of people. the guards at the gate talk about something distracting. francisco passes by the cruiser and drops his keys. kneeling down he extracts a small, powerful, magnetized bomb from his jacket. he attaches it to the underside of the vehicle, stands and walks toward the guard gate.}
