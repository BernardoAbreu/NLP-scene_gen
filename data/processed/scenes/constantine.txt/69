<L>__{exterior los angeles night}
<A>__{various of the city the contrasts between the bright and cheerful and the dark and mysterious. that abandoned mission behind bob's big boy, the islamic temple wedged between competing banks. come to rest on the towering statue of the good shepherd. his hands are welcoming us into the "holy cross cemetery." right across the street is the 20 lanes bowling alley.}
<L>__{interior 20 lanes the bar}
<A>__{john drinks alone. pissed at life. at death. that small black box of his lies on the table unopened. spider runs across the table. john flips an empty glass, traps it underneath. he takes a drag on his cigarette, tips the glass and blows smoke inside. spider can't escape the poison air, bumps the glass. trapped. dying.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{welcome to my life.}
<C>__{angela }
<D>__{mr. constantine?}
<A>__{john looks up, spots angela. those eyes again.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{i saw you at }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{ i remember.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{and }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{she did make an impression.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{i'd like to ask you a few questions.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i'm not really in the talking mood right now.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{could you just listen then?}
<A>__{angela sets her lapd detective badge on the table.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{please?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{always a catch...}
<A>__{angela sits across from him, puts the badge away.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{my sister was murdered last week.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{sorry to hear...}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{her name was isabel. isabel dodson?}
<A>__{she looks for a reaction. none.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{you don't remember her?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{never met her.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{you sure?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{she look anything like you?}
<P>__{(as angela nods)}
<D>__{i would've remembered.}
<A>__{another beat as their eyes meet. john looks away.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{she was a patient at ravenscar. then last tuesday she just decided to step off the roof.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i thought you said she was murdered?}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{isabel would never take her own life.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you'd be surprised at what people will do.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{look, i know i'm not making much sense hell i'm not really sure what i'm doing here... i just feel the circles you travel in the occult, demonology, exorcisms...}
<A>__{john just stares at that spider in the glass. trapped.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{i believe someone got to her, mr. constantine, brainwashed her into stepping off that roof. some kind of legion or cult.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{sounds like a theory. good luck.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{well i thought with your background and experience, you could at least point me in the right direction.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{yeah, okay. sure.}
<A>__{john points toward the exit. angela is not amused. but she's not giving up.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{my sister always talked about a world better than this. heaven as some call it. she wasn't afraid of dying because she knew it was waiting for her. what everyone fails to grasp is that if she had really taken her own life }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{ she would have committed a mortal sin and her soul would have gone straight to hell where it would never feel love or compassion or anything but pain again as the master himself rips her apart over and over for the rest of eternity.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that about right?}
<A>__{the words have hit so hard that angela is speechless. john sees the hurt in her eyes, would like to take it back but it's too late. she turns and starts out, slows }
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{you're not the only one afraid of hell.}
<A>__{john tries not to let that get to him. she leaves. he glances out the window, watches her pass by. so long. good riddance. but something's not right. those deep shadows on the buildings seem to be moving. john watches, confused, realizes they're heading in angela's direction.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{oh shit...}
<A>__{he stands, gains his bearings. as he walks out he flicks the glass over. spider runs free.}
