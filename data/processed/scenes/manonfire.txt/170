<A>__{handball court. intense game with big money stakes. a sea of criminal faces cheer on the gladiators from the bleachers. it's a close match. a 200 pound guardian removes his t shirt before serving. turns to reveal a huge tattoo across two thirds of his back. creasy registers his prey.}

<A>__{a small russian taurus crests a hill and descends into hell. a frightening looking barrio. burnt out cars and dead dogs line the sidewalks. creasy tails the guardian on his moped into the center of a trash dump. the focal point being a semi derelict church within a gated compound. our 'tattooed handball genius' exits the taurus. reaches in back for the groceries.}
