<L>__{interior sub basement day}
<A>__{black as night. the only light comes from the men's flashlights. they're at a crossroads. crooked corridors, with arched ceilings barely the height of a man stretch in several directions. jonathan is crouched down, resting with the panting dogs. the deputies are having a smoke. they all look both uneasy and exhausted except for pendergast. he stares at the blueprints.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{hard to read in this light. the ink is so faded.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{the dogs have lost the scent, mr. pendergast. maybe we should head back.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{not yet. let's try the fork to the left.}
<A>__{the men reluctantly shoulder their shotguns and push on. the hounds walk ahead, carelessly nosing the ground. the flashlight beams illuminate lime encrusted, cave like walls.}
<C>__{deputy two}
<D>__{this place gives me the creeps.}
<A>__{at this the dogs begin to whine. the hair on their backs rises in a ridge. pendergast turns as a breeze stirs his clothes.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{they've got something.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{keep the light up. i can't see.}
<A>__{the dogs strain and pull forward, sniffing the air ahead. the deputies raise up their shotguns as they all move deeper into the darkness. the flashlight beams streak crazily in all directions, barely penetrating the gloom. suddenly the dogs break into a terrifying baying which bounces off the walls.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{shut them up!}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{heel argo! hobbes! heel!}
<A>__{the dogs drag jonathan forward, paying no attention, foaming at the mouth. jonathan is now frightened.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{they're going crazy! i need help!}
<A>__{too late. as jonathan tries to grab the collars, one of the dogs leaps forward, and the leash slips through jonathan's hands.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{he's loose! argo!}
<A>__{argo bolts into the darkness. the men start after the dog, following the frantic barking which echoes farther and farther in the distance. pendergast is in the lead. suddenly he throws out his arms, halts.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{stop!}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{holy mother, what is that?}
<A>__{a goatish odor envelops them all.}
<C>__{deputy one}
<D>__{smells god awful. like rotten meat.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{argo! come!}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{quiet!}
<A>__{a scuffling sound of claws dragging on brick is heard followed by a roar. the men all freeze. the other dog leaps and twists with excitement. in the confusion it also breaks free! it tears after the first dog, disappearing into the darkness. now jonathan is wild eyed.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{no! hobbes!}
<A>__{the deputies are terrified, retreat. the darkness is stifling, claustrophobic. the flashlights are small help. pendergast alone remains dead calm. his voice is cool and commanding.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{forget the dogs. you two, get back here. don't point that gun at me.}
<A>__{the deputies regain control and follow pendergast's orders. they fall into position, pump their shotguns and aim them down the hall. in the echoing darkness ahead of them, the barking falters and stops. there is a moment of silence, then a terrible, unearthly shriek. the deputies quail, frozen in their tracks. jonathan leaps forward.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{argo! hobbes!}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{get back! now!}
<A>__{at that moment a shape hurtles at them from the darkness! the men yell in terror. there are two stunning blasts from the shotguns, two flashes of light accompanied by a deafening roar. the rumble echoes and dies and there's an intense silence, followed by a sob.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{you shot my dog!}
<A>__{hobbes lies five feet from them, a black shadow of death. jonathan kneels by the dog, tears in his eyes. down the animals side is a gash.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{my dog...}
<C>__{deputy one}
<P>__{(stammers)}
<D>__{he was coming right at me...}
<A>__{in the distance they can hear a terrified howl. it's the second dog, hurt or frightened. it's a pitiful sound.}
<C>__{deputy two}
<D>__{let's get out of here!}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{i'm not going anywhere! not without my dog!}
<A>__{pendergast grabs at jonathan who slips from his grasp. jonathan inches back down the hallway calling desperately.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{hobbes!}
<C>__{deputy one}
<D>__{get back!}
<A>__{jonathan shakes his head no.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{there's something out there! let's go get it now! that's why we came down here, isn't it?}
<C>__{pendergast}
<P>__{(to the deputies)}
<D>__{he's right. follow me.}
<A>__{but the two deputies are terrified. they cling to the wall, inching backwards, sheer horror in their eyes.}
<C>__{deputy one}
<D>__{no way. i say we get help. a lot more guns.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{i'm ordering you! cover me!}
<C>__{deputy two}
<D>__{we'll cover you from here!}
<A>__{jonathan is disappearing in front of them. pendergast has no choice. grim faced, he pulls his colt .45 anaconda from a shoulder harness. it's a narrow and evil looking gun. from a pocket comes a handful of}
