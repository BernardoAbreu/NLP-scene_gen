<B>__{conference room}
<A>__{we must have the feeling that these men have been arguing all day. cognac bottles, cigar ends, selzer water, remains of some sandwiches. in other words it is a business battlefield. preysing is drawn and tired. zinnowitz is on his feet. flaemmchen is fast asleep in her chair, making a pretty picture.}

<D>__{...and let me say again for the tenth time...}
<P>__{(he is hoarse and tired)}

<C>__{gerstenkorn}
<D>__{you've talked enough today, you're hoarse now.}

<P>__{(he develops almost a passion)}
<D>__{you don't suppose for one moment that i'm such a fool as not to have something that i could say definitely about manchester.}
<P>__{(he is generating almost a passion)}
<C>__{gerstenkorn}

<P>__{pocket)}
<D>__{i thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.}
<C>__{gerstenkorn}
<D>__{under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.}
<C>__{preysing}
<D>__{under these circumstances we might refuse to sign.}
<A>__{by this time, waitz and zinnowitz have the articles out upon the table. preysing is perspiring. gerstenkorn puts his arms around preysing's shoulders.}

<C>__{zinnowitz}
<D>__{you let me talk till i'm hoarse and you had manchester sewed up all the time. why?}

<C>__{preysing}
<D>__{yes, it has been put through it has been put through.}
<A>__{during this scene, flaemmchen has risen, piled up her papers, glanced at her watch. during this action flaemmchen motions to zinnowitz that she is going down to dance, etc., preysing is unaware of this action. flaemmchen leaves the room trying not to attract attention.}
