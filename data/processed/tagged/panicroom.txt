<L>__{exterior manhattan day}
<A>__{the whole island, from the south. for a second. literally.}
<L>__{exterior new york skyline day}
<A>__{closer, just the skyline. for another second.}
<L>__{exterior upper west side day}
<A>__{closer still, the upper west side. for another second. no time to waste admiring the scenery.}
<L>__{exterior west 83rd street day}
<A>__{race across a field of pedestrians to pick up three women hurrying down the sidewalk. lydia lynch, a real estate broker, vaults down the sidewalk, she's got a hell of a stride. meg altman, thirtyish, struggles to keep up with her, she's tall, wafer thin, pale as a ghost. sarah, a nine year old girl, flat out runs to keep up, dribbling a basketball as she goes. the kid's athletic, much tougher than meg, who she resembles. lydia reads from a sheet she carries in her bouncing hands.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{ seventeen feet wide, fifty five feet deep, forty two hundred square feet, four floors with a rentable basement apartment, so five altogether, courtyard in back }
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{could you slow down a little?}
<P>__{(looking back over her shoulder)}
<D>__{or we could wait for the car...}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{no cars. feet are faster.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{how many more do we have after this?}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{none, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{this is it? i told you on the phone, i have to be moved in in two weeks. sarah, please don't bounce that here.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{mom, it's the sidewalk.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{oh, that miserable little prick is already leaving.}
<A>__{they approach a row of brownstones, narrow four story townhouses, nice looking buildings, a hundred years old or more. evan, a sour looking man, has just locked the front door of number 26 and is coming down the steps. he sees them coming.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{one day you will learn to respect other people's time, lydia, one day you }
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{evan, i am so sorry, you were a saint to wait for us!}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior townhouse foyer day}
<A>__{evan throws open the front door, revealing the airy foyer of the townhouse. the place is completely empty. he talks fast, races through the tour. the three of them come in, sarah still bouncing her basketball.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{this is the middle of the house, the entry floor, living room's over there. the kitchen floor's below us and there's two bedroom floors above.}
<A>__{the front door closes behind them, with a thud so authoritative it seems to say no one's ever getting out. meg tries to get her daughter's attention, to tell her to stop bouncing the ball in the house.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{it's an enormous amount of space for the money and i will be perfectly honest, the family is in no hurry whatsoever.}
<A>__{meg whispers sarah's name, but sarah still ignores her, goes on bouncing the ball.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{no ball, kid.}
<A>__{sarah immediately stops bouncing. she wanders into the living room, peers through the big french doors, which look out over the courtyard area. there's another row of brownstones on the next block, and all the patios back up to one another. it looks tranquil out there, oasis in the city. sarah leans up against the door, sighs, her breath fogs the window. there is a profound melancholy about her. meg watches her, tries to catch eyes with her in the reflection. can't. evan flings open the door of an old fashioned cage style elevator.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{working elevator. mr. pearlstine, the previous owner, was disabled the last ten years of his life. highly unusual, the elevator, you will not find this in ninety percent of brownstones.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{will they take asking price? i need a two week escrow and i'm already approved for the loan.}
<A>__{lydia turns, gives meg an "are you insane?" look.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{what say we see the house before we dicker, hmm?}
<P>__{(starting up the stairs)}
<D>__{i have to warn you, this is exactly the response we expected to get. it's a very emotional property.}
<A>__{as he disappears upstairs, lydia turns to meg, lowers her voice.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{who taught you to negotiate?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{it's not like saks', mom, you don't have to pay the price on the tag.}
<A>__{she gets in the elevator and rattles the door shut with a bang. that kid's got an attitude. meg takes a deep breath, turns to lydia. she brushes her hair behind an ear, we notice her thin hand is shaking.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{i'm sorry. apartments, and... money, and... this is more my husband's area.}
<A>__{she digs in her purse for a prescription pill bottle and some water.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{was. his area. i'm not very good at...}
<A>__{lydia watches as she swallows a pill, waiting for meg to finish her sentence. not very good at what?}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{things, and if i can't prove to my soon to be ex husband that i can provide a suitable place for our daughter to live in the next fourteen days, it's going to get ugly between us. uglier.}
<A>__{lydia just looks at her, no idea what to say. these two are from different places.}
<C>__{evan }
<P>__{(from upstairs)}
<D>__{it would be so lovely if i could shot the property before i leave!}

<L>__{interior top floor bedroom day}
<A>__{evan, lydia, and meg poke their heads in a series of rooms, one after the other, the tour flying by quickly. first, an upstairs bedroom. nice, roomy, looks out on the courtyard.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{top floor. two bedrooms, one bathroom.}
<L>__{interior den day}
<A>__{another floor, another empty room. the trio passes through.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{third floor, spare bedroom, den, what have you. mr. pearlstine used it as an office.}
<C>__{lydia}
<P>__{(low voice, to meg)}
<D>__{he's talking about bernard pearlstine.}
<A>__{meg shrugs, who's that?}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(moving, through a bathroom)}
<D>__{master bath.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{the hotel guy? it's been in the papers lately. his kids are all suing each other over his estate. he was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.}
<P>__{(singsong)}
<D>__{somebody took something didn't belong to them!}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.}
<C>__{lydia}
<P>__{(low, to meg)}
<D>__{stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(through a closet)}
<D>__{master closet.}
<A>__{from the hallway, there is a groaning metallic sound, the elevator, and the happy laughter of the little girl as she puts it through its paces. evan winces, speaks as if his mouth hurts when he moves it.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{could the child please stop that?}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{kid! no elevator!}
<A>__{she looks at meg and winks.}
<L>__{interior master bedroom day}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{and we emerge in the master bedroom.}
<A>__{he checks his watch. meg looks around, studying the dimensions of the room. she looks at the far wall, the one that borders the house next door. she looks at the wall that corners it, opposite the window wall. she takes two steps back from it.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{something's weird.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{i don't know, doesn't that corner seem funny to you?}
<A>__{she points to the far end of the wall, near the entrance to the closet. there is a mirrored door that leads to the closet, and a mirror on the wall alongside it. if you look closely, you'll see that the mirrors are raked slightly toward one another, which causes an optical illusion in which the corner of the room appears much closer to the door than it is.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i was waiting to see if you'd notice! on caravan, no one from our office had the slightest idea.}
<A>__{he pushes on the top of the mirror on the wall. it makes a faint click, then glides open a few inches off the wall. he pulls it toward him, opens it all the way, a hundred eighty degrees, and it fastens magnetically to the back of the closed door. there is smooth wall behind it, but if you look closely, there is a faint vertical crack in the wall. meg looks at him what in the world? even pushes again, twice this time, first at the top, then at the bottom, and the smooth wall clicks ajar. he pulls it wide open. meg and lydia step forward, fascinated.}
<L>__{interior panic room day}
<A>__{from the opposite end of a lone, narrow, windowless space, we see the three of them standing in the open doorway, silhouetted by the sunlight streaming through the bedroom windows behind them.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{it's called a panic room.}
<A>__{he hits a switch and a row of bulbs flick on overhead.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{a what?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{a safe room. an inner sanctum. a castle keep, in medieval times.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{oh, i've seen these...}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{it's quite in vogue in high end construction right now. one really can't be too careful about home invasion.}
<A>__{the other two walk inside, but meg lingers near the door, looking around, studying the neatly arrayed survival supplies water, food packs, batteries, flashlights, tools, rope, clothes, blankets you get the idea.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{hey, this is perfect for you...}
<P>__{(meg scoffs)}
<D>__{absolutely! you're a woman, you're living alone now. your alarm goes off, or you head glass break, or for whatever reason you think someone's broken into your home in the middle of the night. what are you going to do? call the police and wait until they get here on tuesday? traipse downstairs in your sexy little underthings and check it out? i think not!}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{reinforced steel core walls. buried phone line, completely separate, not connected to the house's main line and never exposed throughout the house's infrastructure or outside the house you can call the police; nobody can cut you off. your own ventilation system, complete with oxygen scrubber, so you've got plenty of fresh air for as long as you like. and a bank of video monitors }
<A>__{he hits a switch next to a dozen tiny video monitors, revealing a dozen different views of the house.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{ covering almost every corner of the house.}
<A>__{meg nods, starting to sweat.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{makes me nervous.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{ever read any poe?}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{i don't think so, but i love her album.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{no, edgar allen.}
<C>__{lydia}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{the furniture guy?}
<C>__{meg}
<P>__{(giving up)}
<D>__{what's to keep them from prying open the door?}
<A>__{evan reaches past meg and pushes a red button on the wall behind her. with a sudden whang of steel, a heavy metal door leaps out of a slot in the wall and slams shut, like a submarine hatch. a series of metal latches click into place inside it, from top to bottom, securing it into place.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{steel, four inches thick.}
<A>__{meg takes a step back. they're now enclosed in the room.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{everything's spring loaded, even if the power's out it's fully functional.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{open it.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{old bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{open the door.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{and with kids like he's got, no wonder he wanted a place to hide.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{that's highly inappropriate.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{i said open the door.}
<A>__{evan hits a green button and the door groans slowly open, recoiling its massive spring, and revealing sarah, the little girl, standing in the entryway, grinning widely.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{my room. definitely my room.}
<A>__{she bolts in, just as her mother bolts out.}
<L>__{interior master bedroom day}
<A>__{meg stands just outside the door to the panic room, regaining her composure. not crazy about tight spaces. which we already knew.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{that door is a safely hazard.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{not at all.}
<A>__{he points. there's a tiny red beam that shines across the doorway, one at shoulder height }
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{infrared. like the beam in an elevator doorway. won't let the door close if something's blocking it.}
<A>__{ and one at shin height. even bend down, blocks the one at shin height with his hand.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{watch.}
<A>__{he reaches up, to push the close button, but with one hand anchored at the floor, he can't quite reach it.}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(to lydia)}
<D>__{push that button for me, will you?}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{don't!}
<A>__{lydia pushes the close button, nothing happens. evan pulls his hand put of the beam, takes a step back. lydia pushes the button again. whang! the metal door rockets shut, the metallic slang reverberating in the room. almost immediately, the fake piece of wall hums shut, of its own accord, followed a moment later by the mirror, which detaches itself from the back of the closet door and hums silently back into place, closing over the hidden door, making the corner of the room look like a corner again. as the mirrored door closes, it shows meg her own reflection. she looks at herself, still rattled. she wipes a trickle of sweat from the side of her face.}

<L>__{interior townhouse foyer day}
<A>__{the same house, two weeks later. the entry floor is piled high with moving boxes. sarah and meg lie sprawled out in the middle of the black and white tile, arms and legs splayed wide, exhausted. they stare up at the ceiling, beat.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{too many stairs.}
<C>__{meg}

<D>__{"tom's throat felt so dry and tight that it was a moment before he could make any sound come out. "dad!" he croaked. "i'm inside the machine!"

"the durafoam hardened, dad. get a solvent, quick you know the formula!"}

<A>__{meg, dressed in an old knicks t shirt and boxer shorts, stands next to the alarm panel in the master bedroom, reading from an instruction manual. she's frustrated. she mutters, slurring, a bit drunk.}

<D>__{bypass non ready zones... shunt, enter, zone number...}
<A>__{she tries it, pushing a few buttons, but the alarm panel beeps at her disapprovingly. she's doing something wrong. she sighs, sits on the floor, gets serious about figuring out the instructions.}

<A>__{ the darkened panic room, where the dozen small video screens all suddenly wink to life, showing a dozen views of the house. whatever she pushed turned these on too, probably not what she meant to do, but at least she got the alarm on for the night. the door that leads from the panic room to the master bedroom hangs open. in the middle of the floor in here, somebody has made a small tent of blankets and couch cushions. sarah must have been playing here before bed.}

<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior master bedroom night}
<A>__{ 2:26. meg is in a hard, boozy sleep. we drift out the door of the master bedroom, into the third floor hallway, and down the open stairwell. we glide through the entry floor, still gently falling through the stairwell's airway, dropping even further, all the way down to the kitchen floor, the ground floor. we drift across the darkened kitchen, serpentine through the canyon of moving boxes, approach the window that looks out on the street. we move right up against the window, peer through the glass just as a van pulls up across the street and stops. can't see through its windows. no movement for a moment, then the driver's door opens and a man climbs out. he wears dark clothes. the man closes the door, looks both ways, and starts across the street towards us. he's carrying a bag of some kind. he goes to the door, and we drift down toward the doorknob. we hear a key slide into the door, rattle. but the lock doesn't turn. the key slides out, back in again, jiggles. still won't open the door. the man steps away from the door, goes to the kitchen window, which is heavily barred, and peers inside, right at us. can't see anything, it's darker in here than it is out there. he turns, looks both ways on the street again, then steps up, onto the window ledge. now we can only see his legs, can't tell what he's doing. he's reaching up, stretching for something. it drops into view with a metallic scrape. the fire escape. the man climbs, his feet disappearing from our field of vision. we turn around, facing the other way in the kitchen. we start back the way we came, through the canyon of boxes in the kitchen, toward the stairwell.}
<L>__{interior stairwell night}
<A>__{back in the stairwell, the exact reverse of the shot we saw earlier. we're drifting up, off the kitchen floor, through the entry floor, and as we rise we notice something all the way up on the roof that we couldn't see before, when we were looking down. a skylight. we continue to rise, drawn toward it. we move up, through the master bedroom floor, creeping up alongside the stair banister, now reaching the top floor of the house, and just as we near the skylight a figure appears, visible through it. the man in dark clothes, on the roof now. he stops, peers down through the skylight, looking at us without seeing us again. he steps across the skylight. this is not the way he intends to enter. we drift again, following his soft footsteps on the roof, which we can hear faintly through the ceiling. here in the hall, just outside sarah's bedroom, a closet door is ajar. we squeeze through the gap and into the closet. in the closet, it's completely dark. can't see a thing. but then a sliver of light appears, coming from above. we look up. there is a ladder that's bolted to the wall in this closet, it leads up to a square panel in the ceiling. roof access. and that roof access panel is moving, ever so slightly, moonlight spilling in as it twists in its setting. a shiny silver something slides through the crack along the edges of the portal. it slithers along the edge of the hatchway, searching for something. it finds a small round nub in the crack. the silver something stops. it hums with electricity for a moment, then there is a bright spark and a soft crack.}

<A>__{in the master bedroom, a message appears on the alarm panel: zone 19 disabled}
<L>__{interior closet night}
<A>__{in the closet, the silver something withdraws and the roof access panel is removed. a million stars are visible in the night sky above. but we're inside. and in a moment, so is this intruder. the man peers down, through the open hatchway, then slips through the opening and climbs silently down the ladder.}

<A>__{one floor up, the man steps into the hallway and starts for the stairs, moving quickly and confidently. knows where he's going, knows what he wants. he starts down the stairs, happens to glance to the side as he does so. he freezes. he's looking in the open doorway of the top floor bathroom, staring hard at something that clearly disturbs him. a nightlight. plugged into an outlet in the baseboard in the bathroom. (for the record, it's the power puff girls.) the man climbs the stairs again, concerned, goes to the door of the bathroom. he looks from the nightlight to the countertop. there's a moving box on the countertop. his eyes widen. this is news to him, bad news. he takes a step back and a breath. he turns, looks to the end of the hall. his eyes now adjusted to the darkness, he notices something he didn't see before, something coming from under the door to the fourth floor bedroom. light. from inside. from another nightlight.}
<L>__{interior sarah's bedroom night}
<A>__{in the top floor bedroom, a nightlight burns in another outlet. nearby, sarah is asleep in bed, the covers kicked off. the door to sarah's bedroom glides open, terribly slowly. the man stands in the doorway, staring, aghast, at the mountain of moving boxes piled in the room. his gaze falls on sarah in the bed. the man just stares, beside himself. his lips mouth a word, soundlessly. doesn't take a lip reader to guess it.}
<L>__{interior master bedroom night}
<A>__{in the master bedroom, meg flops over in bed, facing away from the doorway, really having a rough go of it. she slept too hard before, now she's awake, her head is killing her, she's really paying the price of four glasses of wine. she lies still, on her side, facing us. behind her, the bedroom door moves, silently. opening. the man stands there, one finger still on the door he's just pushed open. he stares at the sleeping form of meg on the bed, whose back is to him. he has no idea she's awake. meg lies in bed, eyes wide open, no idea a man is standing in the doorway to her bedroom. noiselessly, the man moves away, down the hall. the moment his head disappears down the stairwell meg flops over again, facing the doorway. she closes her eyes, gives sleep another try.}

<C>__{junior}

<L>__{interior panic room night}
<A>__{she walks into the bathroom and feels around for a light switch, but can't find it. she blinks, squints, tries to get her bearings. the only light is a harsh white glow that comes from along one wall, from a bank of tiny video monitors. she finds the light switch, flicks it on, it nearly blinds her. she's not in the bathroom. she's wandered into the panic room by mistake. she turns around, walks out, leaving the lights on behind her. we linger for a look at the video screens. if only she'd done the same, she'd see what we see. on the monitors, we see the three men, still in the kitchen, huddled in a group, silently debating what to do.}

<C>__{raoul}
<P>__{(whispers)}

<L>__{interior panic room night}
<A>__{meg steps into the panic room, raises her hand to the light switch and stops, her hand frozen in mid air. she cocks her head, looking at something she can't understand. she blinks. takes a step, further into the room. she stares at the video monitors at the three men in dark clothes, stealing silently across the foyer. this can't be. these are just pictures, they have no relation to reality. she drops to her knees, her face inches from the screens, and reaches out to touch them, as if trying to make sure they're really there.}
<L>__{interior stairwell night}
<A>__{they reach the base of the stairs, junior in the lead. as he reaches a bend at the base of the stairs, he places one foot short on an angled step and it slips off. he trips, falls forward.}

<L>__{interior elevator night}
<A>__{meg stands frozen, terrified, staring at junior as they move past him. junior has another go at the door, pulling as hard as he can, actually bending the door, but the elevator is still moving, the catch holds fast and the door won't open. as they pass, his face suddenly disappears, he takes off.}

<L>__{interior master bedroom night}
<A>__{meg and sarah run through the master bedroom. as she passes the night table, sarah swings an open hand to grab her cell phone from its cradle. but in her haste she starts to pull it out at an angle and the prongs at the bottom stick in the charger. the phone slips from her fingers, bounces off the corner of the table, caroms off her foot, and skitters under the bed. sarah turns, looks to the head of the stairs just as junior turns the corner and raoul thunders down the steps from four. she abandons the phone, grabs sarah, and they lunge through the open doorway to the panic room. junior and raoul burst through the doorway to the bedroom, just a few steps away.}
<L>__{interior panic room night}
<A>__{meg and sarah trip over each other coming through the doorway, they tumble to the floor of the panic room, the door wide open behind them. meg spins around, hurls herself at the red button on the wall junior leaps, sailing through the air toward them meg slams her open palm on the red button, the massive coiled spring that holds the metal door open is released, the steel barrier leaps forward out of the wall and whangs shut in a split second.}
<L>__{interior master bedroom night}
<A>__{junior slams into the closing metal door, banging his shoulder into it, and slithers to the ground, too late.}
<L>__{interior panic room night}
<A>__{meg rolls over and pulls sarah into her arms, both of them breathing hard, asking each other if they're okay, scared out of their minds. but safe. she spots the telephone, the one with the special buried phone line. she lunges for it, snatches it from its cradle, listens for a dial tone. nothing there either.}

<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{tell me... tell me they're not in there...}
<A>__{we rise up, above them, above the room, looking down on them, the rats in a maze shot. we rise up further still, above where the ceiling ought to be, to look down on this room and the one beside it, the room behind the four inches of reinforced steel, the panic room in which meg and sarah kneel in the middle of the floor, holding each other tight. standoff.}

<D>__{don't worry about me.}
<A>__{the implications being, worry about yourself. sarah crawls over to the bank of video monitors, studies them. meg crawls over to join her. they scan the screens. on the monitors, there are a dozen different views of the house. front stoop. kitchen. dining room. entry floor. living room. master bedroom. den. top floor bedrooms, both of them. top two floor hallways. even one with a shot of the inside of the elevator. the three intruders are gathered in the living room, standing in a tight circle, having a hell of an argument. lots of gesturing, fingers jabbing in chests, but we can't hear a word. in the panic room, meg furrows her brow, noticing something interesting to the right of the video monitors. she slides over, studies a panel there with sixteen different buttons and a small grilled area.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{hey...}
<A>__{sarah joins her, looks at the buttons. each one is labeled with a different room name den, kitchen, master bedroom, etc. up in the corner there is a button that says "all page," down in the opposite corner there's a button marked "talk." meg looks at sarah.}

<C>__{meg }
<D>__{the police are on their way.}
<A>__{only burnham has remained relatively calm. after he gets over the initial shock, he walks toward the tiny camera that's hidden in an upper corner of the living room wall and stares up at it. raoul, who has taken off his ski mask, is careful to move out of the camera's range, and turn his back to it.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{i suggest you leave.}
<A>__{on the monitors, burnham looks up at the camera and shakes his head, wagging a finger from side to side. he raises a hand, makes a gesture like a telephone, then wags his finger again. the message is clear you don't have a phone. in the panic room, meg is puzzled.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{how'd he know that?}
<A>__{she presses the talk button again.}
<C>__{meg}
<P>__{(into speaker)}
<D>__{take what you want and get out.}
<A>__{that sounded fairly tough. she looks at the monitor again. on the monitors, the three of them have an urgent, whispered conference, then they all start patting their pockets for some reason, turning in circles, looking for something. in the panic room, meg and sarah watch them, confused. on the monitors, burnham holds up a finger to the camera wait a second while raoul and junior rush off screen, looking for something. junior returns a moment later holding something and the three of them hunch over a box, working on something. after a moment, they break apart and junior steps up to the camera holding a pad of paper. he shows it to the camera. on the top page, in big block letters, they've written.}
<B>__{what we want}

<P>__{(into speaker)}
<D>__{what do you know about this room?}
<A>__{on the monitors, there is more frenzied writing, more arguing, and a first draft of a response torn up. finally, junior steps forward with another sign:}
<B>__{more than you.}

<A>__{meg and sarah are down on the floor, rags covering their mouths, trying like crazy to filter the air, but it's not working. sarah is crawling around the base of the wall, near to where she was before, clawing at the strange portal thing again. finally, she finds a small metal handle, folded back into the clover leaf seal on the portal. she unfolds it, twists it. the portal cranks open, revealing it to be at the end of a tube, about a foot long, an emergency ventilation source directly through to the exterior of the house. she bends down and looks through it. it's covered by a metal mesh at the opposite end, but she can see and smell the outside through it. she sits up, gestures to her mother to bend down next to her. she does, and they both jam their mouths up near the end of the tube, gulping fresh air greedily. meg looks at sarah, good job, and they both drop to the floor at the portal and suck air. it's temporary, but it works.}
<L>__{interior master bedroom night}
<A>__{in the master bedroom, the debate has turned physical. burnham lunges across the room at raoul, to get his hands on the valve, to turn off the gas. but raoul catches him and hurls him aside. burnham slams into the wall, bounces off and screams at raoul, who screams right back. junior leaps into the middle, trying to break it up, to get them to shut up, keep their voices down. it's bedlam.}
<L>__{interior panic room night}
<A>__{in the panic room, meg knows this can't go on forever. she turns away from the portal, looks up at the vent, where the streamers still stream. she looks to the other side of the room, to where sarah found the waterproof matches and lighters. she thinks. takes a deep lungful of fresh air from the tube and crawls over to the lighters. she selects one, snatches up a screwdriver. sarah looks at her, has a vague idea of what she's thinking, but can't believe it. she shakes her head vehemently. in response, meg picks up two or three of the fireproof blankets and piles them over sarah, right up to her disbelieving eyes. she bends down, takes another gulp of air. but she's getting woozy. this can't go on much longer. she staggers across the room, hoists herself back up onto the shelf she stood on before, and gets right up next to the vent. holding her breath to avoid breathing the toxic gas, she unscrews the vent cover. the duct is wide enough to put your arm in. she reaches in, past a bundle of multicolored wires that run down through the wall. she reaches all the way in, lighter in hand. inside the duct, we see her hand crawl in, lighter clenched between her fingers. she raises a thumb to the flint wheel, cranks it once. too slow. not even a spark. her hand shakes. she tries again. still no spark. but with the effort and the angle, when she thumbs the lighter it makes her hand twitch, banging up against the sides of the duct with a hollow boom.}
<L>__{interior master bedroom night}

<A>__{he arches an eyebrow. inside the duct, meg's hand is trembling, tiring. she tries again, thumbs the flint wheel. it scratches as it rolls, her hand twitches, booms against the side of the duct. still, the gas hisses through. in the panic room, meg's face is turning color, she's running out of air. her feet tremble on the shelf, she's about to lose her footing. inside the duct, she tries again. scratch. boom. in the bedroom, burnham's eyes suddenly pop wide as he identifies the sound.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{he tears himself away from the wall inside the duct, meg's thumb tenses for one good hard turn in the bedroom, burnham leaps through the air, hurling himself toward the propane tank inside the duct, meg cranks the wheel, a spark sparks, a flame flames, and a hot blue cloud shoots out in two directions, one toward the panic room, the other toward the bedroom. in the panic room, meg jumps off the shelf, throwing herself as far away from the vent as she can, her arm engulfed by licking blue flame. she drops to the floor of the room, covering her daughter's body just as the entire ceiling of the panic room turns into a lake of fire with a deafening whoomp. the fluorescent light tubes explode, showering glass everywhere. in the bedroom, the blue flame shoots out of the wall, into the hose, through the hose, backing up toward the tank. burnham crunches to the floor next to the tank, knocking the other end of the hose away from the spigot just as the blue flame erupts from the end of the hose. the flame engulfs his entire body, his hair starts on fire, his chest, his arms. raoul lunges forward, junior tears the blankets from the bed and throws them over him, burnham howls and rolls on the floor in pain. in the panic room, the blue cloud on the ceiling suddenly evaporates with another angry whoomp, leaving a few little pockets of flame that meg extinguishes by swatting with a blanket. only one of the fluorescent lights is left intact; it casts a flickering, uneven light on the room. she stands in the middle of the still smoky panic room, breathing hard. she shouts, screams incomprehensibly, making no sense whatsoever. she stops, noticing the look sarah is giving her. wide eyed admiring, frightened, you are an insane woman. meg looks to herself. her arm is signed, the hair burned off. the sleeve of her t shirt is burned back to the shoulder. her face is sooty, blackened. meg grunts, half frightened by herself.}

<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{neighbor!}
<A>__{meg and sarah leap as one, facing the common wall, shouting at the tops of their lungs get help, call the police, please, call the police, that sort of thing. they shout and shout, but the soft pounding continues, and if their voices are as soft on the other side as the complaining voice is on this side, they have no hope. their voices crack and they begin to cough, too irritated by the gas to shout for very long. long after they stop, the soft pounding from next door continues. their pleas are not heard.}
<L>__{interior master bedroom night}
<A>__{the intruders have stopped their racket too, and are listening carefully at the common wall. eventually, the soft pounding stops, the complaining voice complains no more. burnham stands there, in pain. things are falling apart. raoul stands in the doorway, silhouetted by the hallway light. he draws himself up to his full, bulky height. he's big.}

<A>__{ and slams it shut. he puts his back to it, thinking, terrified, things are spinning out of control, fast. raoul, in the middle of the kitchen floor, is venting some more of his rage on harris, whom he has hurled to the floor. he lands a solid boot in the side of harris's head, leaving him groaning in pain, completely disoriented. harris rolls groggily into the spreading pool of blood coming from underneath junior.}

<A>__{ and races into the master bedroom, where raoul is motoring, fast, headed for the panic room, where she can already see burnham, standing in the middle of the open doorway, in front of sarah, wearing harris's shirt and a grim "tricked you" expression. meg hurls herself at raoul, lands clinging to his back. she claws and wrestles with him, gets one hand on his ski mask, tears it from his head. he reaches up to try to stop her from pulling it off his gun slips from his fingers, falls to the floor and caroms off his boot, spinning across the floor away from them. raoul flips her off his back violently, she crunches to the floor, clutching his mask and getting a good long look at his face. he makes a move toward his gun, but she's faster, she's already pawing herself frantically across the hardwood toward it. raoul measures the distance, knows he'll lose, and sprints for the panic room instead. meg turns, looks down at the medicine in her hands, then at the door to the panic room, where raoul is right now reaching up to push the button that controls the steel door. she makes a fast decision and lunges, hurling the plastic bottle of glucogen and the black leather pouch through the gap just before the spring loaded steel door slams shut with tremendous ferocity. and then it's silent. meg wails in agony, pounds on the door. she stands back, chest heaving, sobbing. a looooong moment goes by. finally, a voice comes over the house's intercom system.}

<C>__{raoul }
<D>__{you understand?}
<A>__{on the monitors, meg looks up at the camera in the master bedroom. she nods, terrified. in the panic room, burnham pushes past raoul, at the speaker button, and leans forward. he's approaching exhaustion.}

<D>__{i just... i just need forty five minutes.}
<A>__{raoul stands behind him, muttering to himself.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{saw my face, man. saw my face.}
<A>__{on the monitors, we see meg's face, agonized, as she lunges toward the camera, screaming something up at it, the same thing, over and over. but in here her voice is nearly muted, what bleeds through the walls isn't enough to be heard. in the panic room, raoul looks at her image on the monitor, irritated.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{shut up.}
<A>__{in the master bedroom, we abruptly hear her voice, full throated.}
<C>__{meg}

<D>__{ cine, she needs the medicine! give her the }
<A>__{in the panic room, sarah shivers in a corner, knees pulled up to her chest, staring at the intruders, scared out of her wits, and looking very, very sick. burnham looks at her, musters the most reassuring face he can come up with under the circumstances.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{it's gonna be cool, kid. be outta here before you know it.}
<A>__{no response from sarah. burnham cocks a head, really looking at her.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{hurry up, for christ's sake!}
<A>__{burnham turns, grabs his satchel, and drops to his knees in the middle of the floor. over his shoulder, we can see the face of meg on one of the monitors, shouting into the camera, begging them to give sarah her medicine. using his hand, burnham measures six lengths in from the wall, then digs his fingernails into the weave of the carpet, looking for a seam. he finds one, gets hold of it on one edge, and runs his other hand along the seam till he finds a place where it seems to turn a corner. he stands, hovering over the carpet, and pulls back evenly with both hands. the concealed carpet flap pulls back neatly, with the soft sound of tearing velcro. underneath the flap is the smooth metal door of a floor safe. burnham unsnaps his satchel and gives it a shove. it rolls out and opens up onto the floor, revealing a neat array of safecracking tools. he begins his delicate work, but is suddenly jarred by a pounding on the metal door. he turns, annoyed. meg is still screaming outside the door.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{the hell does she want?}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{i don't know, she keeps screamin' the same thing over and over.}

<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{drugs. she wants drugs. what the fuck?}
<A>__{but burnham thinks. his eyes fall on the bottle and the leather pouch she hurled through the door, then whip over to sarah, who sags over into a fetal position on the floor. her lips are moving.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{oh, man...}
<A>__{he crawls over to sarah, puts his ear down next to sarah's lips.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{what is it?}

<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{... 'jection...}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{an injection?}

<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{that stuff?}
<A>__{sarah nods again.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{can you do it yourself?}

<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{come on.}
<A>__{he starts to pull burnham away, but burnham shakes his hand off, violently. he bends down very close to sarah's lips.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{tell me the truth, okay? what's gonna happen if you don't get this?}
<A>__{sarah swallows, licks her cracking lips. when she speaks, it's breathy, almost inaudible. but the words are clear.}

<D>__{coma. die.}
<L>__{interior master bedroom night}
<A>__{seen from overhead, meg paces in the master bedroom, out of her mind with worry, no idea how to communicate to the people in the room the desperate situation. suddenly, a voice comes over the intercom speaker.}
<C>__{burnham }
<D>__{i understand. i will give her the shot.}
<L>__{interior panic room night}
<A>__{a hand comes down into frame and picks up the glucogen and the leather pouch. burnham stands, looking down at them. raoul grabs him, pulls him to the far end of the room.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{you're wasting your fucking time, man, you're wasting my time. you don't know how to do this, and the longer we stay in here, the more likely she's gonna lose it and call the cops!}

<A>__{raoul looks at him.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{then shut up and get out of my way.}
<A>__{as burnham crosses the room, raoul makes eye contact with sarah, who is staring at him.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{don't look at me.}
<A>__{across the room, burnham drops to his knees next to sarah and unzips the pouch.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{okay, kid, all i know about this is what i've seen on tv, you gotta talk me through it.}
<A>__{sarah tries to form words, but she's too weak. burnham swallows.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{okay. no talking. no problem. tv don't lie, right?}
<A>__{he reaches into the pouch, take out a syringe, a sterile pad, and a length of rubber tubing. he takes sarah's arm, stretches it out, exposing the underside of her forearm.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{you seem like a good kid. your mom... only saw her for a second, but, woah. beautiful, huh?}
<A>__{no answer. burnham ties the rubber tubing around sarah's arm, pulls it tight.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{hey, nod or something, show me you're still alive, will ya?}
<A>__{sarah nods.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{attagirl. that too tight?}
<A>__{sarah shakes her head no. burnham takes the syringe, starts to fill it from the glucogen bottle.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{you guys are pretty rich, huh?}
<A>__{sarah shrugs. while burnham goes through the process of finding an exposed vein and giving the injection itself, he goes on, as much to comfort sarah as to comfort himself:}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{yeah, you don't think about that stuff. good for you.}
<A>__{he looks at her, sees her looking at him. thinking about him.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{i know, i know. i really screwed the pooch this time. i never did anything like this before. break into somebody's house? not even close. bad cards, kid. i swear to god, i been on the wrong end of maybe six straight years of bad cards. house. car. wife.}
<P>__{(snaps his fingers gone)}
<D>__{those are some seriously bad cards. and still, every time i pick up a fresh hand i swear to god, the rush comes so hot and prickly i feel it right down to my toes because this time, this one time, it might be there, this time it might be that hand, that perfect hand, that monster hand.}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{and you thought you were sick.}
<A>__{the shot successfully given, he pulls sarah's sleeve back down.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{feel better?}

<C>__{raoul }
<D>__{she's okay. now sit down and wait.}
<A>__{he clicks off. meg is hugely relieved. and extremely pissed off. she goes to the corner of the room and picks up the gun, the one that raoul dropped. she heads downstairs.}

<A>__{shit. this is exactly what she prayed for him to do, now it's the worst thing that could happen. she stands, thinking, desperate. she walks toward the door, stops, thinks some more. the doorbell rings again. she comes up with a plan. she goes back to where harris is in the chair, pulls the chair back a few feet, out of view of the door. she puts the gun in his lap, puts his hand over it to steady it. she leans down, whispers to him.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{don't. say. a word.}
<A>__{he nods. meg takes a breath, walks across the foyer, tousling her hair as she goes. in the panic room, raoul is staring at the monitors, aghast.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{holy shit... holy shit...}
<A>__{burnham races over, looks over his shoulder. one monitor covers the front stoop, and on that monitor they can clearly see two uniformed cops.}

<D>__{she's fuckin' crazy, she killed the kid! she just killed her own kid!}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{it's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them. look, look, look, she's telling us.}

<C>__{meg}
<D>__{okay, look. my husband and i just broke up. it's my first night in the new house, and i was feeling a little lonely and a little drunk. the sentence, if you insist on knowing, was going to be "there are three things i will do for you if you come over right now and get in bed with me."}
<A>__{cop 2 stifles a laugh.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{but thank god i came to my senses before i said all that and hung up instead, so nobody would ever know what i was thinking, unless, of course, two policemen showed up in the middle of the night to interrogate me about it.}

<A>__{meg is back in the library, hurriedly unscrewing the window. she gets the last screw out, shoves the window up. the wind blasts in, it's a hell of a spooky night out there. she leans out the window. we lean with her. the sidewalk is empty (we see it only from our vantage point inside the house). she's one floor up. to her right is the house's front stoop. she tosses the sledgehammer over, onto the stoop. climbs up onto the window ledge, and slithers out herself. we lean further, watch her as she edges along the ledge, hops down onto the stoop, and freezes, staring in horror at the video camera that covers the front stoop. on the monitors, we see her staring straight up at the camera, clearly standing on the front stoop, outside the house, where she was specifically told not to go. in the panic room, sarah sees the image of her on the stoop. raoul happens to be looking away at the moment, at the safe, but he starts to turn around, to look at the monitors again and sarah kicks him, hard, in the ass.}

<A>__{finally, the door to the safe crunches in on one side, yielding to the drilling at the very moment that the head of a sledgehammer crashes through the wall of the panic room. raoul grabs hold of sarah, burnham maintains his focus, throwing open the safe, revealing nothing. crunch! the sledgehammer head strikes again, opening up a hole about a foot across. light spills through from the other side, as well as the voice of the hysterical neighbor. raoul hurls sarah against the far wall, leaps over to the side of the hole, and waits, poised above it. at the safe, burnham doesn't lose his cool, just opens a false bottom in the safe, revealing a manila envelope. he snatches it up, rips it open, and his eyes dance as he holds up fourteen individual one million dollar u,s, treasury bearer bonds. he fans them out, eyes drinking from his grail. bang! a gunshot whizzes right through one of the bonds, setting it aflame before it slams into the far wall, sending up a little cloud of plaster dust.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{jesus!}
<A>__{he whirls, sees an arm poking through the hole in the wall, gun extended. but raoul is standing just above the hole, and already has his boot raised, over the hand. he brings it down, a crunching blow that stomps right on meg's wrist. meg screams, loses her grip on the gun, and it clatters into the space between the houses. between the walls, the gun falls into oblivion, the space between the walls, where no one can get to it. in the panic room, burnham shoves the loose bonds into his jacket.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{i got the money, let's go!!!}
<A>__{raoul grabs sarah and turns, jabs the green button to open the door. behind them, meg screams in anger and wriggles through the opening. before she's even all the way through, she gets hold of raoul's leg and pulls herself into the panic room, scraping and bloodying herself on the edges of the too small hole.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{go, let's go, outta here!!}
<A>__{but raoul is deep in a violent rage. still holding sarah with one hand, he bends down, grabs meg by the hair, and drags her toward the doorway.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{you know how this is gonna go!}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{fuck you, i'm gone!}
<A>__{he bolts out of the room, through the metal door, which is just finishing its slow crank open, its heavy spring coiling in the wall. raoul drag meg across the floor by the hair, right into the track of the open steel door. she looks up, sees the infrared safety beam over her head, and realizes with horror what his intention is. still with one arm holding sarah, who is kicking and struggling viciously, raoul holds meg's head down on the floor, below the safety beam that would prevent the door from closing. he reaches for the "close" button. sarah raises her arm, stuffed with three syringes, and jabs them into raoul's neck. raoul screams in pain. meg manages to raise her head, breaking the beam.}
<L>__{interior hallway night}
<A>__{on the stairwell, burnham, stops, frozen, his face twitching with indecision. he hears the murder taking place just above him. he runs down three steps. stops again. runs down the rest of the stairs.}
<L>__{interior master bedroom night}
<A>__{raoul stretches to push the red "close" button for the door, but he has to hold meg's head down, out of the lower beam with one hand, all with sarah savagely attacking him at the same time, and three syringes hanging out of his neck. finally, he gets meg's head all the way down, onto the floor. looking up, meg sees the red beam become complete again. raoul jabs the button just as sarah throws her hand into the upper beam, the one at shoulder level. sarah's hand turns red, the beam is broken, the door will not close. raoul roars in anger and twists violently, sending sarah flying across the room. meg strains, gets her head off the floor again, breaking the beam. raoul starts jamming the close button, over and over again, the beam completes, then breaks, completes, then breaks, never the button and the beam at the same time. but it can't go on forever. meg's tiring, she can't keep it up, her head trembles and collapses onto the floor. the beam completes raoul smacks the red button and burnham appears on the other side of the door. he reaches in, grabs hold of raoul, to pull him off her, but raoul loses his balance, falls forward into the gap and his head is crushed by the spring loaded steel door that slams forward just as meg draws herself back. meg falls across the panic room, grabs sarah, and holds on tight. the door detects the obstruction and opens again, slowly. raoul's body slumps to the floor, dead. burnham stands there, looking down at meg and sarah. they stare at each other, wordless, their first face to face contact. she sees the bonds protruding from his jacket. she just looks at him. there will be no understanding here. he zips his jacket, turns, and hurries away.}
<L>__{interior entry floor night}
<A>__{burnham races down the steps, hurries to the entry door, throws it open and finds a gun barrel pointed directly into his nose. he blinks, tries to focus on whoever's on the other end of that gun. it's the cop, the first cop, the one who came to the door and was so suspicious of meg. the cop looks down, sees blood smeared all over burnham's jacket, sees more than enough to know his suspicions were correct.}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{put your hands up.}
<A>__{burnham freezes, silhouetted in the doorway. wind and leaves blow into the house, a real gale outside. from behind cop 1, more cops shout, all at once, must be a half dozen of 'em there, but burnham can't see anything in the stinging light, and can't hear much either, over the roaring wind. burnham moves suddenly, flinging the door shut right in the cop's face. the door slams hard, burnham turns to run but doesn't get more than a few paces before three sharp gunshots crack through the door behind him. brilliant white light spills through the bulletholes in the door, but it's not the light that gets you, it's the chunks of lead. they rip through burnham's back and come out his chest, a triangle pattern. burnham stops, sags to his knees. he reaches into his jacket, pulls out the loose stack of bonds. he fans them out, stares down at them, holds them like playing cards.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{monster hand.}
<A>__{behind him, the front door cracks open, half a dozen cops appear and start shouting, all at once. burnham tosses the bonds to the floor, the same gesture as folding a hand of poker. he groans and collapses, slowly, falling through the bonds, twisting as he goes down. he slaps onto his back in the foyer as the wind gusts through the open door, scoops the bonds up off the floor, and blows them back into the house, as if they were never meant to leave. burnham lies there on the floor, eyes open, staring up at the ceiling, looking at the bonds that swirl in the blast of air, suspended there, twisting and bucking and diving just over his head as he dies.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior central park great lawn day}
<A>__{the swirling bonds melt into swirling leaves, blowing in the air over central park on a crisp fall day. the leaves float down, over the great lawn, that massive expanse of grass we saw in meg's hallucination. but on a day like this the great lawn's full of people, throwing frisbees, playing football, lying there doing nothing. the leaves land on the grass next to meg and sarah, stretched out on a blanket, a newspaper spread in front of them, open to the ads. meg is on her back, arms folded behind her head, staring up at the clouds. sarah is intent on the paper, circling the occasional ad.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i mean, uptown is close to dad's place, but somebody at school said the village is really cool, so... i don't know, it's so great to be close to the park and everything... what do you think, i mean, give me a clue, here, where are we gonna live?}
<A>__{meg rolls over, props herself up on one elbow. she seems years younger. she looks at sarah, reaches out, brushes her daughter's hair behind one ear. she smiles. she is calm. behind her, a flock of pigeons takes off, leaping into the clear autumn sky.}
