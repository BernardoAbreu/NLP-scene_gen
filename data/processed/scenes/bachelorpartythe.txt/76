<A>__{long shot looking down the wide courtyard of stuyvesant town, its endless little pathways winding from the various apartment house doors to the central pathway which leads to a stairway to the street. it is half past five in the morning. the sky is gray and desolate. the courtyard and any other street we see is absolutely empty. the camera pans over this empty expanse to the stairway where charlie appears now, coming quickly up the steps. he moves down the central sidewalk, a little faster than he would usually walk; you have the feeling he is exerting an effort to keep from running. camera pans with him as he hurries to one of the winding side lanes leading to a particular apartment house.}
