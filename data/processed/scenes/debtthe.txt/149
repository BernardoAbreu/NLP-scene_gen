<L>__{interior auditorium later}
<A>__{the place is empty now, only david and rachel sitting in the seats. david looks like a man who's been up on speed for too long, eyes strangely bright in his exhausted face. neither of them seems to be able to bridge the divide}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you look well.}
<A>__{rachel ignores this. she's waiting for an explanation.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{does stephan know you're here?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i expect so. (beat) i read about him. how is he?}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{the same. different. resigned to life at a desk. he likes to play the tragic hero...}
<A>__{she stops herself, ashamed.}
<C>__{rachel }
<D>__{things became...very bad between us. we try to stay civil for sarah.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{have you met anyone else?}
<A>__{rachel stares at him. how can he even ask this?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{no. thank you for asking. there was someone...but he left. and i never heard from him again.}
<P>__{(beat, hard)}
<D>__{what are you doing here, david?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i wrote you letters.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{pity you didn't send any of them}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{rachel...}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{what is it? thirty years...?}
<A>__{she's suddenly so angry, she starts to gather her things to go.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i wanted to see you...}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{all that time...not a single word?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{don't go.}
<A>__{she stops.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i was ill for a while, rachel.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{i spent some time in ... in a kind of hospital}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{mexico}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{what were you doing in mexico?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{different jobs. some teaching. whatever i could get.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i travelled a lot. the states. most of south america. north africa.... i kept moving}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{looking for him}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{who..?}
<A>__{he doesn't answer and she looks up, suddenly realising who he means. she feels a sudden, instinctive rush of fear.}
<C>__{rachel }
<D>__{why?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what would you have done if you had found him..?}
<A>__{he's watching her intently}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i would have told the truth. i would have gone to the newspaper, and said "this is the surgeon of birkenau." i could have finally seen him face trial.}
<A>__{rachel listens to this, mesmerised.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{and what would have happened to us?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{we'd be free. whatever happened to us, it seemed to me we'd be free.}
<A>__{rachel stares at him without answering}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{don't you agree? aren't you tired of lying? isn't that what you would have done if you'd found him?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{but it isn't just us. (beat) it's sarah...}
<A>__{beat. something changes in david's face, something fading away. he sits slowly back}
<C>__{rachel }
<D>__{she hasn't done anything wrong.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{if the truth had come out she}
<P>__{would be destroyed. (beat)}
<D>__{so...no, i wouldn't have told the truth.}
<P>__{(a long beat)}
<D>__{but you never found him}
<A>__{she looks at him, waiting for him to contradict this.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{no i never did.}
<A>__{the lecturer appears at the doors to the auditorium.}
<C>__{lecturer}
<D>__{ms singer?}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(relieved)}
<D>__{yes. thank you...}
<A>__{she stands up again, the spell is broken.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{there's a car for me....(putting on her coat) did you hear about sarah's book...?}
<A>__{after a moment, david nods.}
<C>__{rachel}
<A>__{the launch is tomorrow. perhaps you could come? i don't know if stephan will be there or not, but...}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(suddenly)}
<A>__{if we could go back... if i'd waited for you...if you'd come...would it have been different...?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{we can't go back.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{come tomorrow. we'll talk then?}
<A>__{david gives a smile that might be an assent. or might not. rachel nods, walks quickly out of the auditorium. david sits as the light banks above switch off one at a time, watches the line of shadow moving towards him.}
