<L>__{interior lambeau's office day}
<A>__{will is in lambeau's office. lambeau is at the board, working on a diagram as tom takes notes. will seems disinterested.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{this rectangle is subdivided into rectangles. one edge of an inner rectangle is an integer. can you prove that one edge of the larger rectangle is an integer?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{okay. how?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{it's an integer proof.}
<A>__{lambeau smiles.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{what? hey, look buddy my time's almost up. you want me to sit here for an hour and write it out?}
<A>__{lambeau says nothing. will gets up and goes to the board.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{look, i will give you the key steps to it but i'm not gonna do the whole thing.}
<A>__{lambeau keeps smiling.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{that would be a monumental waste of time, wouldn't it, will?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i think so.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{i happen to know so.}
<A>__{lambeau rises and goes to the board.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{you're thinking too hard. what if i did this?}
<A>__{he draws a vertical line through the diagram.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{now, what if i do this?}
<A>__{he draws a horizontal line through the diagram. he hands will the chalk.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{have you ever played checkers?}
<A>__{will realizes what lambeau is getting at. in a flash he starts drawing lines through the diagram, energized.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you color code it. half red, half black. if that's an integer }
<A>__{lambeau steps in, writing with him [will].}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{half red, half black }
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{ that? }
<C>__{will}
<D>__{ half red, half black }
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{ that edge!}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{an integer.}
<A>__{the two stop. they are silent for a moment. like two gunfighters after a duel, they put down the chalk.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<P>__{(checks his watch)}
<D>__{it would appear we got that proof in under the wire after all. it's not how hard you look at things, young man, it's the way you look at them. if you take aim before you fire, you will find the most difficult problems become, quite literally, child's play.}
<A>__{will gets his coat.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{will, you've managed to offend four of my colleagues so much that they refused to come back. you're meeting with the leading hypnotist in the country next week and tom and i plan to sit in on the sessions, so i expect you to behave appropriately.}
