<A>__{an el train rages against its metal rails.}
<L>__{interior train}
<A>__{it is three a.m., and the train carries the usual urban night crawlers. neo sits alone, eyes shifting, watching everything nervously. there is a metal bang and train clatter fills the car as the door is opened. neo turns and sees a large man enter. he is wearing sunglasses and a black leather jacket. his name is apoc and he walks straight at neo.}
<C>__{apoc}
<D>__{come with me.}
<A>__{neo stands just as the door at the opposite end opens and two police officers rush in, drawing their guns. apoc grabs neo, muscling him to the nearest exit. there is no upcoming station. apoc yanks the emergency brake and the train buckles against its own speed. the cops are thrown back. neo slams against the metal rail. the doors open onto nothing and just when neo regains his balance, apoc shoves him backwards he flies out from the train, arms windrilling as he falls from, the raised tracks hurtling towards a busy city street when, out of nowhere, a truck races under him and he crashes into a large dumpster bed filled with empty boxes.}
