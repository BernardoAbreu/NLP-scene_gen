<T>__{fade in:}
<A>__{inside a closet. it is a large closet with double doors, a crisp line of light cutting down through the center of the darkness. as we begin to descend, voices echo in our head.}
<C>__{violet }
<D>__{i had this image of you, inside of me, like a part of me.}
<A>__{we move past a shelf filled with hatboxes and handbags. it is a woman's closet.}
<C>__{corky }
<D>__{you planned this whole thing, didn't you?}
<C>__{caesar }
<D>__{where's the fucking money?}
<A>__{we glide over the tightly packed hangers, close enough to feel the different fabrics and descend past the dresses to the racks of high heels.}
<C>__{violet }
<D>__{we make our own choices, we pay our own prices.}
<C>__{caesar }
<D>__{all part of the business.}
<C>__{violet }
<D>__{all part of the business.}
<C>__{corky }
<D>__{what choice?}
<A>__{we slide along the delicate taper of a stiletto heel and reach the bottom of the closet, where we find a pair of black dr. martens boots that are tied together with a white rope.}
<C>__{violet }
<D>__{i want out.}
<A>__{we move up the boots and we see it is a woman who is bound, lying motionless on the floor of the closet, the rope coiling tightly around her wrists. the crack at the bottom of the door lights her face. she is gagged and unconscious, a trickle of blood running down her forehead. her name is corky.}
<C>__{violet }
<D>__{like a part of me.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior elevator day}
<A>__{leaning against the back of the elevator is corky, a very butch looking woman with short hair and a black leather jacket. she is a lesbian and wants people to know it. as the doors begin to slide shut, a woman yells.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{wait! hold the elevator.}
<A>__{corky pushes the "open" button. a couple steps into the elevator. his name is caesar, a middle aged italian, wearing an expensive suit and sunglasses. she is violet; a piece of sexual candy that would melt in your mouth. she hears it again, a guttural sound.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{thanks again for this opportunity, mr. bianchinni. goodbye.}
<A>__{she hangs up the phone and walks toward the wall. as she gets closer, we hear a bed rocking, tapping against the wall. the man's breathing grows more and more labored until finally it swells }
<T>__{dissolving into:}
<L>__{interior bathroom morning}
<A>__{the whining motor of a high powered drain rod. the spiral cable whips wildly, spiraling deeper into the tub drain, black goo splattering everywhere. the machine is so loud corky almost cannot hear someone pounding on the apartment door. killing the motor, she stands and goes to the door. behind the door is violet, wearing jeans, a white t shirt and cowboy boots.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{hi. my name is violet. we sort of met in the elevator }
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{yeah, sure. i'm corky.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i heard you working in here and i just wondered if you'd like a cup of coffee?}
<A>__{she is holding two cups of coffee: one black, one with cream.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{sure. come on in. give me a minute.}
<A>__{violet steps inside as corky goes back to the bathroom to wash off the drain dreck.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{what happened to rajeev?}
<A>__{corky calls from the bathroom, scrubbing her hands vigorously.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{oh, he went home to india, but as far as i know he'll be back.}
<A>__{she wipes her hands on her overalls, returning to the main room.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{so this is temporary for you?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{pretty much. one day at a time.}
<A>__{violet hands her the cup of black coffee.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i guessed you were straight black.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{good guess.}
<A>__{they both sip from the piping hot mugs.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{mmmm ... thanks, i needed this.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{my pleasure ... but to be honest, i did have a slightly ulterior motive here. i was wondering if i could ask a small favor?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{a favor?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{yeah, see, i'm kind of a night person, so i was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{oh, i'm sorry }
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{no, it isn't your fault. the walls here are just so thin.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{are they really?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{yes, it really causes problems. sometimes it's like you're in the same room. but if it's too much trouble, i understand ...}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{no, no trouble. there's other work to do.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you're doing everything yourself?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{that is so amazing. i'm in awe of people who can fix things. my dad was like that. we never had anything new. whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work. his hands were magic.}
<A>__{she looks at corky's hands cupped around the mug.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{yeah ... i bet your car is twenty years old.}
<A>__{corky smiles.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{truck.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{truck. of course.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{'63 chevy.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i knew it.}
<B>__{violet sips}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{so, how do you know the owner, mr. bianchinni?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i don't, really. i was referred to him.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{oh, really.}
<A>__{corky suddenly feels she has revealed something.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{do you know him?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{no, but caesar does. he likes him. says he's a good italian.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{caesar is your husband?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{oh no, no. i'm not the marrying kind.}
<A>__{smiling, she says nothing else.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i should be going. you can drop the cup off anytime.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{my pleasure.}
<A>__{corky watches her leave.}
<L>__{exterior the watering hole night}
<A>__{a dirty bar hidden away on a dark street, its cracked, moon white sign the only evidence it exists. corky's truck swings into a space in front of a couple of large motorcycles. she flips her collar and heads for the door.}
<L>__{interior the watering hole night}
<A>__{the smell of leather and cigarette smoke fills corky's nose as she crosses to the bar.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{well, well ...}
<A>__{corky sits as the fat bartender waddles over.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{been awhile, cork.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{five years, two months, sixteen days. how you doing, sue?}
<A>__{corky puts a cigarette in her mouth and lights it.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{like shit. now that we're all caught up, how about a drink?}
<A>__{sue opens the refrigerator and pulls out two old styles.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{they click the bottles together and drink.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{you got a job yet?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{yeah. some plumbing, painting and shit.}
<A>__{sue laughs.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{i mean a j o b. a real job.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{not for me, sue. i'm straight and narrow. i'm just here to get laid or drunk and hopefully both.}
<A>__{corky gets off the stool.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{thanks for the beer.}
<A>__{looking around, she sees a woman alone at one of the back tables. through the smoky din, she bears a slight resemblance to violet. the woman is dressed all in black, including a leather jacket. smiling, corky slides into the chair beside her. there is no one smoother.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{you know ... that outfit would look great on my bedroom floor.}
<A>__{the woman smiles just as someone taps corky on the shoulder. she turns and is face to face with a large bull of a woman in a heavy leather chicago police jacket. she is more wide than fat.}
<C>__{woman cop}
<D>__{hey, jesse. what's happening here?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{nothing ... yet.}
<C>__{woman cop}
<D>__{who's this?}
<A>__{her coat opens as she puts her hands on her hips. a service revolver is clipped to her belt. she squints at corky, her head nodding in recognition.}
<C>__{woman cop}
<D>__{wait, i know you.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{woman cop}
<D>__{i didn't know you were out.}
<A>__{corky smiles at the woman in black.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{when you get tired of cagney and lacey, come find me.}
<A>__{she heads for the exit.}
<L>__{exterior city street night}
<A>__{the neighborhood would be politely described as "rough." corky's truck does not stand out parked alone on the littered street.}
<L>__{interior corky's apartment night}
<A>__{it is a hole but it is home. corky is lying on her futon staring up at the ceiling, a beer resting on her stomach; a folk singer quietly croons from the radio. we see the ceiling, a circle of light hovering over the small desk lamp. we move in on the spot, which slowly fills up the screen until there is nothing but the white light. suddenly a wet paint roller loaded with white paint cuts a swath across the ceiling.}
<T>__{match cut to:}
<L>__{interior empty apartment day}
<A>__{corky is painting the ceiling. the folk ballad has become an angry riot grrrl anthem. she is working hard, the roller sucking back and forth. sweat covers her face. dropping the roller down, she reloads it in the tray when the phone rings. she stops and answers it.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{hello? oh, hi, mr. bianchinni ... yes, everything is going fine. i got the tub drain all cleaned out.}
<A>__{she listens for a moment.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{what apartment?}
<A>__{she glances at the main wall.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{all right, all right, i guess i could take a look. yeah, you're welcome, goodbye.}
<A>__{she hangs up and looks again at the wall, feeling... curious.}
<L>__{interior hall night}
<A>__{corky knocks and after a moment violet opens the door. she seems surprised.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{oh no. shit. i didn't know he would call you. god, you must think |i'm a total nuisance.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{not exactly.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i usually would call rajeev, but i didn't know what to do so i called mr. bianchinni.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{he said you lost something.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{yeah, come on in.}
<A>__{she steps back and corky walks inside.}
<L>__{interior caesar's apartment night}
<A>__{violet leads her through the apartment. it is expensively furnished with very masculine tastes; a lot of gray and black leather.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i was doing some dishes and just as i pulled the stopper my earring fell in.}
<A>__{corky looks at her blankly.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{it's one of my favorites. that's why i got upset. i know it probably seems ridiculous to you.}
<A>__{an eyebrow goes up.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i'm sorry, look, forget it. i shouldn't have called...}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i told bianchinni i would take a look. is it that sink?}
<A>__{violet nods. she opens the sink cabinet and pulls out a pair of channel locks from her back pocket. the teeth of the channel locks open and bite onto the pressure nut.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{do you have a pot or a bucket?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{she hands one down to her. corky slides it under the curved pipe. as she works, corky feels herself staring at violet, at the hem of her dress curving tightly around her thighs. water begins to trickle into the pan. the nut slides loose and corky tips the trap. water splashes into the pan with a soft metal "tink."}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{did you find it?}
<A>__{corky fishes into gray water and pulls out the earring. violet screams, a huge smile on her face, half falling as she tries to hug corky.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i can't believe it! you did it!}
<A>__{corky leans back under and replaces the trap.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{thank you so much. you have to let me pay you something }
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{no. mr. bianchinni asked me to do it. i did it.}
<A>__{corky checks the drain by running the water.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{if you won't take money, how about a drink? it's getting late. you can't work all night.}
<A>__{corky eyes her for a moment.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{okay, one drink.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{a beer?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{a beer. of course.}
<A>__{she smiles and turns to the bar.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{sit down.}
<A>__{corky sits on the black leather couch and violet returns with two bottles of heineken. corky sneers.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{thanks again.}
<A>__{they clink the bottles and swig.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you seem uncomfortable. do i make you nervous, corky?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{she looks at violet, then takes another long pull on the bottle.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{thirsty, maybe.}
<A>__{violet smiles, her eyes again talking for her.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{curious, maybe.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{curious? that's funny, i'm feeling a bit curious myself right now.}
<A>__{violet notices the tattoo on corky's arm.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{that's a great tattoo.}
<A>__{she reaches over and touches it.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{beautiful labrys.}
<A>__{corky is a bit suprised that she knows what it is. she nods, rubbing it as if trying to hide it.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{are you surprised that i know what it is?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{maybe.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i have a tattoo, would you like to see it?}
<A>__{she moves closer, sliding over the leather cushions as she opens the front of her dress.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{a woman in upstate new york did it for me.}
<A>__{she is not wearing a bra.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{here. do you like it?}
<A>__{set against the soft white skin of her breast is a bright green stemmed violet.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{it took her all day to do it. she promised me it wouldn't hurt, but it was sore for a long time after. i couldn't even touch it.}
<A>__{corky looks up from violet's breast to her dark eyes.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{but now i love the way it feels.}
<A>__{she runs her fingers softly over the slightly scarred skin.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{here, touch it.}
<A>__{corky feels the blood pounding in her ears as violet takes her hand and places it on her breast.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{violet looks at her.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{isn't it obvious? i'm trying to seduce you.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{because i want to. i've wanted to since i first saw you in the elevator.}
<A>__{corky watches her, trying to figure her out even as her thumb presses into violet's nipple. inhaling sharply, violet closes her eyes; she can feel corky staring at her.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you don't believe me. but i can prove it to you.}
<A>__{she takes corky's wrist and begins pulling her hand down her body.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you can't believe me because of what you see ...}
<A>__{she forces corky's hand between her legs, up under her dress.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{but you can believe what you feel.}
<A>__{violet opens her eyes, a wanton smile on her lips.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you see ... i've been thinking about you all day.}
<A>__{corky's forearm flexes and violet moans. with both hands, violet takes hold of corky's forearm.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{you planned this whole thing?}
<A>__{violet's head swims; she is unable to breathe.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{you dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{if i say yes, will you take your hand away?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{... yes.}
<A>__{now it is corky who smiles. violet shivers, her thighs rubbing, her hips thrusting against corky's hand.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{please, corky ... please ...}
<A>__{her eyes barely open.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{... kiss me.}
<A>__{in a single motion, corky takes hold of the back of her neck and covers violet's open mouth with her own. with her hand still stuffed between violet's legs, corky lays her back onto the couch as the kiss becomes more more desperate, more hungry until we hear the front door unlock and open.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{violet?}
<A>__{violet's eyes pop open and she pushes corky back.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{violet, you home?}
<A>__{they scramble to compose themselves.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{yeah. in here, c.}
<A>__{he comes around the corner and in the dim light sees the two figures sitting close on the couch.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{what's this?}
<A>__{he mistakes corky for a man.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{what the fuck is this?}
<A>__{violet stands as caesar barrels toward the couch.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i didn't expect }
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{what the fuck is going on?}
<A>__{corky stands and turns, caesar suddenly realizing that she is a woman.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{oh, shit ...}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{caesar, this is corky. corky, caesar.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{i'm sorry, christ, i thought ... it's fucking dark in here.}
<A>__{he reaches to the wall for the lights.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{she is working for bianchinni.}
<A>__{caesar extends his hand.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{oh, right, right. don mentioned that to me. hi, welcome to the family.}
<A>__{corky shakes his hand.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{you're helping rajeev?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{no. rajeev's in india.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{she's doing the work herself.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{no shit. bianchinni hired you? you know he's a good friend of mine. |family, really.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{that's what violet said.}
<A>__{he looks at her as if he knows something.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{so, you just got out?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{jesus, caesar!}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{what? it ain't no big fuckin' deal. i know who don hires. did you know he did time himself?}
<A>__{corky shakes her head.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{thirteen fucking years. see, there ain't no secrets here.}
<A>__{corky doesn't like this man.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{how many'd you do?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{five.}
<A>__{he whistles.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{not bad. what for?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{that's none of your goddamn business, caesar.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{you're right. you don't have to tell me, if you don't want to. i just hope you understand you're among good people here.}
<A>__{he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a thick fold of money and peels several hundreds. corky stares at it.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{come on, come on. if you understand what i'm talking about you're going to take the money. if you don't, i'm going to have to worry about you.}
<A>__{corky takes it. caesar smiles.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{good. i hate to worry. i got ulcers.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i should be going.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{what? how about a drink?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{my brushes, i have to clean my brushes. thanks, though.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{another time.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{sure.}
<L>__{interior empty apartment night}
<A>__{close on the paintbrush, corky's fingers pushing through and separating the black bristles under the running water. when the brush is clean, she flicks it dry and resets the edge. she goes to the sink to wash her hands when she stops, noticing her left hand. it is the hand that was between violet's legs. she is about to smell her finger when she sees herself in the mirror.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{she drops her hand.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{what am i doing? i'm fucking up, that's what i'm doing.}
<A>__{she scrubs her hands clean.}
<L>__{exterior parking lot night}
<A>__{it is late, the area burnished with amber street light. corky walks from the building to her truck. she climbs inside and slides the key into the ignition, when suddenly the passenger door opens and violet gets in. stunned, corky stares at her.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i had to see you.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{look, i don't think this is a good idea.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i wanted to apologize.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{don't apologize, please. i can't stand women who apologize for wanting sex.}
<A>__{violet smiles.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i'm not apologizing for what i did }
<A>__{she slides across the seat.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i'm apologizing for what i didn't do.}
<A>__{she kisses corky, and if corky is trying to resist, we can't tell. the windshield is beginning to steam when violet, panting, breaks the kiss.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{do you have a bed somewhere?}
<A>__{unable to speak, corky reaches over and starts the engine.}
<L>__{interior corky's apartment night}
<A>__{the sex. there is nothing flower scented or out of focus about it. it is sweaty, slippery, body grinding, bed squeaking lesbian sex pungent and potent and when it is over, neither woman can move. finally, corky's eyes flutter open.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i can see again.}
<A>__{violet smiles. slowly, corky gets up and goes to the fridge. she grabs a beer and presses it to her sweating forebead. after a moment, she lowers it, gently pressing the cold can elsewhere. eyes closed, she lets out a long "ahh." violet hears the sizzle pop of the beer as corky returns to the bed. she holds the beer to violet's lips and tilts the can, watching violet's throat as she drinks. violet's eyes open.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{... i needed that.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{tell me about it.}
<A>__{corky hands her the beer as violet sits up a bit.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{caesar's mafia, isn't he?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you have to ask?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{funny, nobody calls it that anymore. caesar calls it "the |business."}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{how did you meet him?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{they took over a club i was working at. caesar started managing it.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{he's a launderer?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{basically.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{how long have you been with him?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{almost five years.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{five years is a long time.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{yes, it is.}
<A>__{corky stares at her beer. she knows what violet is thinking.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{the redistribution of wealth.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{isn't that what you wanted to know? what i did time for?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{the redistribution of wealth?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{that's what i tell someone when i'm trying to get them in my bed.}
<C>__{violet}

<D>__{my cellmate would say she did her time for getting caught. she was always more honest than me.}
<A>__{corky sips her beer.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i started stealing when i was little. we were piss poor, which is not an excuse, just a fact.}
<A>__{it isn't like her to talk about this, especially with someone she just met.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{the first time i remember so vividly. a bunch of us kids were at waxman's drugstore, when mr. waxman, who was a mean old prick, always worrying about us robbing him, dropped a roll of quarters.}
<A>__{we can almost hear the coins tinkling on the tile floor.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i can still hear that sound, those quarters, because right then something clicked inside of me. some instinct took over and as everyone, including waxman, dove down, i reached up and emptied the cash register.}
<A>__{violet smiles. she likes this woman.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i gave most of the money to my mom. i told her i found it at the trainyard. she was so happy she cried, calling me her lucky charm. fifteen years later, i guess my luck ran out.}
<A>__{sbe swallows that with beer.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{sometimes i tell myself that i didn't have a choice, that stealing was surviving. usually i can admit that's bullshit. i did it because it was a way out. it was easy and i was good at it, real good.}
<A>__{she glances at violet.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i don't usually talk this much. i guess i have been rehabilitated.}
<A>__{violet laughs.}

<A>__{fiddling with her keys, corky recognizes the voice that answers him.}

<A>__{shelly glances over his shoulder at corky, answering in a hushed voice.}
<B>__{shelly}
<A>__{i have to leave. tonight. for a moment the intercom is silent. then the door buzzes and shelly pushes inside. corky follows him to the elevator.}

<D>__{you are so beautiful.}

<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{nothing.}

<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you didn't want to see me, did you?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{if there is one thing i can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading.}

<D>__{i'm not afraid of anything.}

<D>__{i don't understand ?}
<C>__{corky}

<D>__{we're not that different, corky.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{how can you sit in that bed and say that?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{because it's the truth.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{let me guess. this is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside. that inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{oh no, she's nothing like you. she's a lot smarter than you.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{is that what her daddy tells her?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i know what i am. i don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.}

<D>__{i don't.}

<C>__{violet}
<D>__{what you heard wasn't sex.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{what the fuck was it?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{all my life, everyone has been telling me that when i have sex, i'm not really having sex. not real sex. but they're wrong. i know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.}

<D>__{what was it then?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{work.}
<A>__{that knocks corky back.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you made certain choices in your life that you paid for. you said you made them because you were good at something and it was easy. do you think you're the only one that's good at something?}
<A>__{violet stare pins corky to the wall.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{we make our own choices and we pay our own prices. i think we're more alike than you want to admit.}

<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you mean shelly?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{don't tell me, you're a workaholic.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{no. shelly knows what i am. he saw me in a bar with another woman.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i suppose he just wants to watch.}
<A>__{that's all violet can take.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{fuck it! i think you better leave.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i think so, too.}
<A>__{violet turns away.}

<L>__{interior bathroom day}
<A>__{corky's legs jut out from the old wicker vanity as she finishes detaching its anchors and pipe work. she stands, giving it a yank and pulling it away from the wall, when voices begin to filter in from the next door apartment. she listens a rising string of warbling sobs drowned out by an angry voice.}

<C>__{angry voice}
<D>__{did that hurt? news flash, fucko: i'm just getting started.}
<A>__{the angry voice belongs to johnnie marzzone. shelly is kneeling in front of the toilet, hands tied behind his back with electrical wire. johnnie marzzone is a flashy young man in armani slacks, silk shirt and silver tipped cowboy boots. his tie is tucked in, as if torture were a fine dining experience. caesar and two other men are crammed in the small bathroom.}

<C>__{johnnie}

<C>__{corky}
<D>__{violet? are you all right?}
<A>__{almost unnoticeably, violet shakes her bead. corky puts her arm around her.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{come on. let's go.}
<L>__{interior bar day}
<A>__{it is the kind of bar businessmen drink at in the afternoon. dark wood and padded leather. the bartender, joking with a cluster of men, does not notice corky as she moves up to the bar.}

<C>__{violet}
<D>__{shelly was skimming from the business. he came to see me yesterday because he was afraid caesar figured it out. he wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him.}

<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{he was in love with you, right?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{that's what he told himself. but it wasn't even about me, it was about caesar. he wanted what caesar had. that's how they are. i understand them.}
<A>__{she glances around the room; a man at the bar smiles at her.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{for shelly, taking the money was a way to take from caesar. he could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{sounds like he wanted to get caught.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{maybe he did. he would brag to me all the time. he was never afraid of caesar because he didn't know him. not like i do.}
<A>__{two men sit down near them, laughing.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{caesar lives for these moments. he tells me it's just the business, but i know it's more than that. he likes it. the violence. i will catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars. he says they remind him who he his. they're all like that. except maybe mickey.}

<D>__{mickey?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{he's the part of the business that the rest of them pretend to be. |but mickey doesn't like it like they do. i suppose that's why he's good at it.}

<A>__{violet nods.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{these people are serious, violet. if you want to know how serious, ask shelly. they're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules. you fuck them, you've got to do it right.}

<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you think i'm lying?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i didn't say that, but since you did, let's say that you are. it would have been easy to set shelly up. you could have got him killed knowing that caesar would bring the money to the apartment.}

<C>__{corky}
<D>__{for me, stealing is a lot like sex. two people that want the same thing sit in a room and they talk, they start to plan and it's like flirting, a kind of foreplay, because the more they talk about it, the wetter they get.}
<A>__{she stops.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{the difference is, i can have sex with someone i just met, someone i hardly know, but to steal i need to know someone like i know myself.}

<C>__{violet}
<D>__{in his office. i saw it this morning.}
<L>__{interior office day}
<A>__{violet cautiously enters the office with a cup of coffee. working furiously at the computer, caesar jumps when he sees her, bloodshot eyes animal wide. he checks his watch as she sets the coffee in front of him.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i need to go to the store.}
<A>__{he nods automatically, back in his work, as she sees the briefcase filled with perfect rows of hundreds.}
<C>__{violet }
<D>__{it's in a case, on his desk.}
<C>__{corky }
<D>__{does the case lock?}
<A>__{we see the open top with its silver flip over locks.}
<L>__{interior corky's apartment day}

<D>__{johnnie?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{it sounded like he and caesar don't like each other.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{like each other? they hate each other.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{it started way before i was around. i think basically it's because he thinks johnnie is a complete idiot. but johnnie runs chicago because gino is his father.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{who is gino?}
<A>__{violet suddenly feels that she has made a mistake.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{gino marzzone.}

<C>__{corky}
<D>__{gino marzzone is coming to your apartment. it's a big deal, isn't it? that means caesar will be ready. he doesn't want to look like an idiot. gino has been there before?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{yeah, twice.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{not much, really. caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment. |the first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.}

<D>__{it's getting better and better. keep going.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{gino doesn't know english, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much. he gets right to the pointerior both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.}

<C>__{violet}
<D>__{scotch, glenlivet. i remember that caesar made a huge deal about it.}

<D>__{the more attractive you are, the more believable it will be.}
<L>__{interior corky's apartment day}
<A>__{corky breaks her thought train.}

<C>__{violet}

<D>__{any bodyguards?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{gino travels with a big man named roy. caesar calls him the driver.}

<C>__{violet }
<D>__{waiting for what?}
<A>__{through the wall we can hear the shower.}
<C>__{corky }
<D>__{for the shower. that will be our signal.}
<A>__{corky opens a thin box filled with needle thin lock picks. she selects several and slips them into her multi pierced ears like earrings.}
<C>__{corky }
<D>__{when he's done with his shower, you will go to the bar.}
<L>__{interior bathroom night}
<A>__{in slow motion, caesar drops the shower plunger and water chokes from the faucet.}
<L>__{interior living room night}
<A>__{behind the bar, violet pulls out the bottle of glenlivet.}
<C>__{corky }
<D>__{you'll get out the scotch that gino drinks.}
<A>__{violet steps out from the bar, her eyes on the bedroom, when the bottle slips from her hands. we watch it slowly fall }
<C>__{corky }
<D>__{and as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands. and shatter against the hardwood floor.}
<C>__{corky }
<D>__{an accident.}
<C>__{violet}

<A>__{caesar yells from the bathroom.}
<C>__{caesar }
<D>__{what happened?!}
<L>__{interior empty apartment night}
<A>__{hearing caesar, corky gets up, moving quietly toward the door.}

<D>__{v! what the fuck was it?! violet?}
<L>__{interior living room night}
<A>__{caesar enters, a towel wrapped around him, hair still dripping.}

<D>__{caesar, it slipped ... i was trying to get ready ...}

<C>__{violet }
<D>__{what if he sees you?}
<C>__{corky }
<D>__{he won't.}
<L>__{interior bathroom night}
<A>__{caesar is working intensely on his fingernails. we glide over a set of gleaming metal manicure tools. we see his hand as he delicately applies a coat of clear polish to a nail. through the open door, we see corky moving almost casually across the living room.}
<L>__{interior corky's apartment day}
<A>__{corky is looking for something.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you can't know for certain that he won't see you.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{trust me, violet.}
<A>__{she finds a black duffel bag from one of her tool buckets.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i'm just asking, what if?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{if he does ...}
<A>__{corky slips her hand in between the mattress and box spring, pulling out a gun.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{then i won't have a choice, will i?}
<A>__{she tosses the gun on the bed.}
<L>__{interior office night}
<A>__{the black case is lying on the desk, locked shut. corky moves around the desk, dropping down behind it.}
<C>__{corky }
<D>__{when i'm inside, i will get the money.}
<A>__{from her earlobe, she chooses the right pick, sliding out the silver tool. it takes only a second and the first lock pops open. she is working on the other lock when the door is pushed open and caesar walks in. corky drops down, grasping for her gun as caesar, wearing only underwear, enters. he blows on the drying polish on his fingernails before delicately selecting a suit from his closet. the gun ready, corky, pressed against the desk, waits until he leaves. she lets her breath out, then pops the second lock, unzips the black duffel bag and quickly empties the case, filling the bag with fat money bricks.}
<C>__{corky }
<D>__{i'm going to need something ...}
<A>__{finished, she zips up the bag and looks about.}
<C>__{corky }
<D>__{... to fill the case.}
<A>__{sbe sees a stack of newspapers hidden near the desk.}
<C>__{corky }
<D>__{yeah, you should hide it near the desk before you leave.}
<A>__{she fills the case, then closes it.}
<C>__{corky }
<D>__{at that point }
<A>__{she thumbs the locks shut and they snap, unnaturally loud, into place.}
<L>__{interior corky's apartment day}
<A>__{they are both on the bed.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{there is no going back.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{when i get the scotch, how do i know you won't take off?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{the same way i will know that you went to scotch. trust.}
<A>__{their faces are close, eyes still trying to read each other.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i still don't see how i'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment. everyone will think i did it.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{not caesar.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{because of what you are going to tell him. you have to make it as real as you can. the moment you open the door with the scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan.}
<L>__{interior caesar's apartment night}
<A>__{the door bursts open. violet enters quickly, carrying a bottle in a thin brown bag.}
<C>__{corky }
<D>__{if it's real enough, he'll believe it, because deep down he'll want to.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{c! shit, i'm sorry!}
<A>__{caesar wanders out, tightening his tie. she looks at her watch.}
<C>__{violet}

<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{they just left, didn't they?}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{what are you, drunk?}
<A>__{he smiles, grabbing the bottle from her.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you mean they weren't up here?}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{no! they're still on their way.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{that doesn't make any sense.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{because i just saw johnnie downstairs.}
<A>__{caesar turns.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i was getting out of the car when i saw him in the mercedes.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{it couldn't have been.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{it was him. i'm positive.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{it's impossible!}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{caesar, i know johnnie. it was him. i screamed when i saw him. i couldn't believe i missed them. i knew you were going to be upset so i thought i'd apologize and give gino the scotch. i honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.}
<A>__{she watches him, her words caving in around him.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{but gino's plane doesn't get in for another half hour.}
<A>__{violet thinks.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{actually, i didn't see gino in the car.}
<A>__{his eyes dart. his forehead beads with sweat. he turns toward the office.}
<L>__{interior corky's apartment day}
<A>__{violet is staring at corky's mouth.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{if caesar hates johnnie like you say, then the second he opens the case he'll know, in his gut, that johnnie just fucked him. he'll realize that he has no choice. he can't touch gino or johnnie. there's only one way out.}
<A>__{she pauses.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{he'll have to run.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{if he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{you'll be clean and we'll be rich.}
<L>__{interior office night}

<D>__{thank you.}

<D>__{if you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. it's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart.}

<D>__{i had a partner and she fucked me.}

<D>__{no no no no ...}
<A>__{she moves around the side of the desk and sees the newspaper.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{oh god ...}
<A>__{he slams the case shut, his head hanging down. after a moment he looks at her, like a little boy about to cry.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{... i've been set up.}
<A>__{he seems ready to scream but can't say anything.}

<D>__{that fuck! that rat fuck! little shit rat fuck!}

<D>__{what happened?}

<D>__{that means he probably will kill johnnie.}
<C>__{violet }
<D>__{oh, christ, i got to get out of here!}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it. you're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.}

<D>__{no.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{see, right now he doesn't know that i know, that's why he put the paper in the case. he wants me to hand the case to gino. then there is no doubt it was me. gino will put a bullet in me himself. but it ain't going to happen. i won't let it! johnnie ain't going to fuck me! not like this! no way!}

<L>__{interior caesar's apartment night}
<A>__{caesar drags himself in. violet closes the door behind them. caesar moves into the room where it happened. he is dizzy and confused and does not want to be here. violet turns him around.}

<A>__{she turns him toward the bathroom. he nods.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{i can use johnnie's car, dump it in lake michigan ... i need plastic bags ... tape and rope ...}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{just hurry.}
<A>__{nodding, he heads for the kitchen.}
<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{violet enters and goes straight for the phone. she looks at the blank wall as she dials.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{please, corky ...}
<A>__{the phone rings. when corky answers, violet almost collapses with relief.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{oh, thank god.}

<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i was so afraid you ...}

<D>__{you don't quit on me, violet, and i won't quit on you.}
<L>__{interior kitchen night}
<A>__{a box of hefty bags tucked under his arm, a coil of clothesline in his hand, caesar searches through several cabinets.}
<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{violet glances at the door.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{corky, it worked! he's going to run. he needs to take care of the bodies to buy himself time, but as soon as he leaves, it's over.}
<L>__{interior empty apartment night}
<A>__{corky falls against the wall.}
<C>__{violet }
<D>__{just a little longer and it's ours.}
<L>__{interior kitchen night}
<A>__{mumbling to himself, caesar walks out of the kitchen, heading for the bedroom.}
<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{violet reaches out and touches the wall, as if she were touching corky.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{corky, i have to tell you something ...}
<L>__{interior empty apartment night}
<A>__{corky turns to the wall.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i know, violet. i know.}
<A>__{her fingers gently touch the wall as we travel up and over, where we see they are actually touching the wall in the exact same place.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{it's why i'm still here.}
<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{suddenly, violet hears caesar.}
<C>__{caesar }
<D>__{violet?}
<A>__{as he opens the door, she slams down the phone.}
<L>__{interior empty apartment night}
<A>__{the line cuts off.}
<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{fear and panic paralyze violet as caesar drops everything, grabbing for his gun.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{who was that?}
<A>__{he levels the gun at her.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{who the fuck was that?}
<A>__{she stands and be rushes at her, grabbing her by the throat.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{was that mickey? did you call mickey? did you?!}
<A>__{she shakes her head and he throws her on the bed. the gun aimed at her, he picks up the phone and hits the redial.}
<L>__{interior empty apartment night}
<A>__{unsure of what happened, corky hears the phone ring and answers it on reflex. listening, she waits.}
<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{caesar listens, waiting as long as he can.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{mickey? is that you?}
<L>__{interior empty apartment night}
<A>__{corky hangs up, jumping away from the wall.}
<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{caesar hits the redial again.}
<L>__{interior empty apartment night}
<A>__{panicking, corkydoesn't answer it, but as it rings very loud in the empty apartment, she realizes her mistake.}
<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{turning slowly toward the wall, caesar hears the phone ringing in the empty apartment.}
<L>__{interior empty apartment night}
<A>__{corky rips the plug out of the wall.}
<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{the line goes dead.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{who is that? who is over there?! tell me!}
<A>__{she tries to get away, but he grabs her and slaps her to the ground.}
<L>__{interior empty apartment}
<A>__{corky hears violet scream and that does it. gun in hand, she flies at the door.}
<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{the door to the empty apartment slams shut and caesar, hearing it, starts to run but violet reaches out, catching his ankle, sending him crashing to the dresser.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{run! just run!}
<L>__{int hall night}
<A>__{the door to caesar's apartment is locked. corky falls to one knee, whipping two lock picks from her earlobe.}
<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{caesar raises the gun to pistol whip violet and she screams.}
<L>__{interior hall night}
<A>__{working the lock, corky hears violet's scream cut off. she feels the tumblers click, and rotates the cylinder. a shadow stirs under the crack of the door as she hears something that sounds like footsteps. corky freezes. corky presses down low against the door beneath the peephole. she can almost feel caesar beyond the door, but grits her teeth and turns the doorknob.}
<L>__{interior apartment night}
<A>__{the door cracks open and corky slips in, gun first. as she moves into the room, we see caesar behind her. he puts his gun to her head.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{drop the fucking gun or die!}
<A>__{corky hesitates.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{drop it!}
<A>__{she does.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{turn around.}
<A>__{rising from her crouch, she turns and he recognizes her.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{you!? holy fucking christ! you gotta be kidding me!}
<A>__{he starts to laugh when she strikes knocking the gun, she punches him, slamming him back against the door as she twists, diving, grabbing her gun, just as he steps and kicks her full in the face.}
<L>__{interior closet night}
<A>__{still unconscious, corky's head jerks, reacting to the kick. we see the dried blood caked to her check where his kick split the skin. she is again swimming toward consciousness. we hear water splash, her face flinching as we move closer, the sounds and voices echoing.}
<C>__{cesar }
<D>__{wake up! come on, you fucking dyke!}
<A>__{we hear caesar slapping her.}
<C>__{caesar }
<D>__{wake up!}
<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{corky's face is dripping with water as her eyes slowly blink open. coming into focus is caesar, standing over her with an empty glass in one hand.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{except for the gag, she is bound as we have seen her bound in the closet. caesar yanks out his gun and puts it to her head.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{i know everything now so i don't want to hear any "i don't know" bullshit, you understand?}
<A>__{she sees violet on the bed, also bound hand and foot.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{god, i should have seen this coming! the second i met you, i knew it. everyone knows your kind can't be trusted! fucking queers make me sick.}
<A>__{the gun digs into her cheek.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{but you tried to fuck the wrong guy. and i swear to you that i'm going to kill you for it.}
<A>__{he thumbs back the hammer.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{where is the money?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{don't tell him }
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{shut up, violet!}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{he can't kill you }
<A>__{he aims the gun at violet.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{violet!}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{not until he has the money!}
<A>__{he fires and she jumps as the bullet punches through the wall behind her. his point made, he puts the gun back to corky's head.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{now, where the fuck is my money?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{lick me.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{where is it?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face.}
<A>__{blood temperature rising again, caesar pulls the gun back and slaps her with it.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{stupid cunt!}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think }
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{don't try to tell me what to do.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you need the money just like we do.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{shut up, violet.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{let us go and we'll make a deal.}
<A>__{he rushes at her, grabbing a fistful of her hair.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{shut the fuck up!}
<A>__{he looks at corky.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{what did you do to her?! this isn't my violet!}
<A>__{he looks at her as if unable to recognize her}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{what did she do to you?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{everything you couldn't.}
<A>__{he shoves her down.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{you ungrateful bitch! you had nothing before i met you. you were nothing!}
<A>__{he stomps around the room.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{who gave you this place? this apartment?}
<A>__{he throws open the closet.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{who gave us all of this? i did! i gave you everything! i gave you this life! i made you, violet. i saved you.}
<A>__{he seems to believe what he is saying.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{i saved you.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{ha! what a load of crap. look at yourself, caesar. you're a thug. |you launder money for the mob. you rent women like you rented this apartment.}
<A>__{he doesn't want to hear this.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{saved me? you don't even know me. you used me, caesar, just like i used you. all part of the business.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{you betrayed me!}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you murdered gino!}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{i had to. you made me.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{bullshit, you killed him. not me. you did it because you couldn't stand the thought of johnnie fucking you.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{shut up!}
<A>__{he slaps her.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{okay, you want business, i will give you the fucking business.}
<A>__{he leans closer.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{i'm going to make you beg just like shelly did. just like shelly!}
<A>__{he storms out of the room. corky looks up at violet.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i'm sorry, corky ...}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{don't be sorry. help me.}
<A>__{she pulls at the ropes as violet slides off the bed.}
<L>__{interior kitchen night}
<A>__{caesar throws open the broom closet and grabs the clippers that mickey used to cut off shelly's finger.}
<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{the two women are back to back, fingers working at each other's knots when caesar bursts into the room.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{oh, no no no.}
<A>__{grabbing corky by the boots, he drags her and flips her so that she can now see violet. he drops down onto violet putting the clippers in front of her face.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{hey, violet, you remember these?}
<A>__{her eyes widen with terror. she starts to scream when he stuffs a towel in her mouth. laying against violet, he turns to corky.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{i'm going to start with her so you'll get a good idea what's coming.}
<A>__{he takes hold of violet's pinky finger, stretching it out.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{i'm going to ask you where the money is. every time you don't give me an answer, i'm going to cut off one finger.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{when i reach ten, then i will start with you.}
<A>__{he puts the finger between the blades.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{where is the money?}
<A>__{corky sees violet thrashing helplessly. she has no choice. her mouth opens as the door buzzer rings. caesar is distracted, trying to think who it could be.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{... mickey.}
<A>__{he sees the phone, where he dropped it, lying off the hook. the door buzzer rings again, more insistently. corky sees him momentarily unnerved. he looks back at her.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{i said where }
<A>__{he starts to cut and corky screams }
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{no! i will tell you!}
<A>__{he stops, the door buzzing continuously.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{it's over there in the empty apartment.}
<A>__{as she speaks, the sound of the door buzzer changes.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i put it inside one of the paint drums.}
<A>__{he is not looking at her; listening, he realizes that mickey is buzzing the other apartments. caesar stands as the buzzing stops. he pulls out his gun and aims it at corky.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{i promised i would kill you.}
<A>__{he cocks it.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{you can't kill me yet.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i could be lying.}
<A>__{his hand start to shake with ftustration. he is beginning to hate this woman more than he ever hated johnnie. taking a deep breath, he eases back the hammer.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{you're going to wish to god you hadn't done that.}
<A>__{he kicks her again, snapping her head back. after he leaves, violet looks over and sees corky lying unconscious.}
<L>__{interior hall night}
<A>__{caesar tries to open the door to the empty apartment but it is locked.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{fuck.}
<A>__{at the end of the hall, the elevator "dings." just as the door opens, caesar jumps back into his apartment.}
<L>__{interior caesar's apartment night}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{son of a bitch ...}
<A>__{his mind a racing blur, he locks the door and runs back to the bedroom.}
<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{with another towel, he gags corky and drags her into the closet. in her pocket, he finds the key. he closes the doors, then hangs up the phone. grunting, he hauls violet up over his shoulder when there is a knock on the door.}
<L>__{interior living room night}
<A>__{carrying violet, he hurries to the kitchen, where he throws corky's gun into the freezer. mickey is banging on the door as caesar heads for the bathroom.}
<L>__{interior bathroom}
<A>__{dropping violet onto the floor, he reaches behind the curtain and turns on the shower.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{mickey will get in. i know he will.}
<A>__{we hear the water hitting the bodies while caesar starts tearing off his clothes.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{violet. i can kill you right now if that's what you want. if you want to live, then you have to help me. i need you to make mickey believe that everything is normal.}
<A>__{he picks up his gun.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{tell me, do you want to live?}
<A>__{she stares hard at him and his gun, then nods.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{good girl.}
<L>__{interior living room night}
<A>__{we move toward the door as the lock clicks open.}
<L>__{interior bathroom night}
<A>__{violet's hands are untied. she pulls off the gag and the ropes at her feet. naked, caesar sticks his head under the shower spray, wetting everything.}
<L>__{interior living room}
<A>__{still dripping, caesar walks into the room, a towel wrapped around his waist, another towel in his hand. mickey and lou are standing in the middle of the room. caesar jumps.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{jesus christ!}
<A>__{caesar holds his chest, laying it on a bit thick.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{holy fuck, mickey! you scared the shit outta me.}
<A>__{he sees they both are holding their guns.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{what is this? what are you two doing, sneaking in here with your peckers in your hands? you gonna do me, mick? is that it?}
<A>__{mickey smiles, putting his gun away.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{no, cease. there was no answer.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{i thought i heard someone knocking.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{i was buzzing, i was knocking, but i guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{yeah, it was violet's idea. i was so wound up about gino, she was trying to help me relax.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{that violet is one nice lady. wish someone would help me relax.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{shit, mick, come on in, let me get you a drink. sit down, lou.}
<A>__{behind the bar, he sets down the towel be was holding and we see the gun hidden inside it.}
<L>__{interior bathroom night}
<A>__{violet watches through a sliver of open door, her mind already working.}
<L>__{interior living room night}
<A>__{caesar is making the drinks.}

<D>__{we was worried about you, cease.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{me? why?}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{we went over to johnnie's place just to check it out and it was busted up, bad.}
<A>__{caesar hands him a drink.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{i started thinking maybe it's about the money so i call you, but all i get is the busy signal. i figure the phone is off the hook, that's why i come rushing over here.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{oh christ, the phone ... that was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{hey, if violet was helping me relax, i'd probably do the same thing.}
<A>__{mickey smiles as he sips his drink.}
<L>__{interior bathroom night}
<A>__{violet stands and goes to the shower curtain. she reaches in and turns off the water. steadying herself, she pulls back the curtain, exposing the wet, bloody bodies.}
<L>__{interior living room night}
<A>__{mickey is looking at the furniture.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{cease, can i ask you something?}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{why'd you move all the furniture around?}
<A>__{the knot in caesar's stomach tightens.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{let me guess. that was violet's idea, too.}
<A>__{he laughs, and lou laughs with him.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{actually, yeah, she was nervous about gino coming, wanted everything to look right. you know women, mick.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{sure, cease. they make us do stupid things, don't they.}
<A>__{caesar smiles feebly.}
<L>__{interior bathroom night}
<A>__{violet has pulled up johnnie's body and is digging through his coat pockets, searching for something.}

<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{yeah, that's it.}
<A>__{caesar puts his hand inside the towel as mickey walks across the rug.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{that fucking shelly. i gotta hand it to the guy, but jesus, if i were him i would have bailed a long time ago. i mean, how much money does a man need?}
<A>__{talking to lou, be picks up the case and walks back, somehwo moving right between the wet spots.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{i remember i was just staring at all this goddamn money, shelly down on his knees, and the next thing i know, johnnie just blows his head off.}
<A>__{he slaps the case up onto the bar.}

<A>__{caesar takes the smallest breath.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{i didn't need a key to get in here, did i?}
<A>__{he pulls out a lock pick and starts working the lock. the muscles in caesar's forearm bulge as he tightly squeezes his gun. he is slipping toward that same desperate choice. he is going to attack when across the room, the phone rings. everyone looks at it.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{who the hell could that be?}
<A>__{the phone is near the couch. caesar doesn't want to let go of the gun. the phone continues to ring.}

<D>__{come on. come on, please.}

<L>__{interior hall night}
<A>__{caesar half falls out of the stair door, drenched with sweat.}
<L>__{interior empty apartment}
<A>__{gun ready, caesar throws open the door. spread out like a pond of milk is the spilled paint, but the money is gone. leading away from the white pool are boot prints and the drip trail of the plastic bag. the tracks lead to the bathroom. caesar kicks open the bathroom door and finds the bag of money next to corky's empty boots. over his shoulder we see corky already swinging a massive pipe wrench. at the last second he is able to duck, falling to the ground as the doorjamb splinters with a terrible metal crunch. before he can recover and shoot, she brings the wrench down on his arm. he screams as the gun hits the floor. she kicks it, sending it skidding, hydroplaning across the paint pool to the other side, leaving a jet trail of white swirls and spirals on the wood floor. they fight, corky raining blows onto his back and flailing arm until he catches her foot, flipping her as he clambers up. scrambling across the paint, slipping, crawling for the gun when violet bursts in, pointing the gun from the freezer.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{stop!}
<A>__{caesar, on hands and knees, looks at her, then at his gun still out of reach.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{it's over, caesar. i called mickey. he's on his way.}
<A>__{violet stands for long time, the gun trained carefully on him as he rises from the floor. panting, caesar watches her like a mad dog.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{get out of here, caesar. if you want to live you had better start running.}
<A>__{he smiles.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{all these years and you still don't know me, violet.}
<A>__{she glances down and sees the paint covered gun.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{but i know you.}
<A>__{he turns to the gun.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{caesar, don't.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{what are you going to do, v? shoot me? kill me in cold blood? i don't think so. i will tell you why. if you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago. if i was you, i would have killed me the minute i brought the money home. but you didn't and i know why, because you don't want to kill me. do you, v? do you? no, i know you don't.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{caesar, you don't know shit.}
<A>__{violet fires the bullet hits caesar in the shoulder, knocking him off balance. another doubles him over as blood speckles the pool of painterior she empties the gun into him. his body arcs back, falling, splashing into the painterior caesar's blood bubbles out bright red against the glistening white.}
