<L>__{interior. crowne's office sanger industries tower}
<A>__{silence . crowne sits at her desk. merrick sits across from her. waiting. the air stirs as the secretary ushers dr. sanger into the office. no greetings are exchanged. sanger just lowers into a chair, a little unsettled to find merrick has preceded him.}
<C>__{crowne}
<D>__{i take it you've heard the news.}
<C>__{dr. sanger}
<D>__{the bond agents. yes. unfortunate.}
<C>__{crowne}
<D>__{unfortunate?}
<P>__{(pauses, lights a cigarette)}
<D>__{we're way past unfortunate, henry.}
<C>__{dr. sanger}
<D>__{i thought we'd covered ourselves.}
<C>__{crowne}
<D>__{the police won't connect the bond agents to us. but that's not the problem. it's the sponsor.}
<C>__{dr. sanger}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{the male agnate tracked him down.}
<C>__{crowne}
<D>__{his name's thomas lincoln. it seems they had a genetic reunion. not a h a p p y one. it was all i could do to stop him going to the authorities.}
<C>__{dr. sanger}
<D>__{i still don't see the problem.}
<C>__{crowne}
<D>__{he may not want a police involvement but he's already threatened to file suit. and he's one of the biggest litigation attorneys in the city.}
<C>__{dr. sanger}
<D>__{that's why we have you, ellen.}
<C>__{crowne}
<D>__{that's why i asked bernard to come out here. to find out how it happened.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{i told her, henry. about synesthesia.}
<A>__{s a n g e r casts a betrayed look at merrick. then returns to crowne }
<C>__{dr. sanger}
<D>__{i t was a marginal problem. and it was under control according to bernard.}
<C>__{crowne}
<D>__{that's not the pointerior whether or not it's a factor in this instance, it puts us in breach of the clone laws.}
<C>__{dr. sanger}
<D>__{i t doesn't even touch their genetics.}
<C>__{crowne}
<D>__{i'm talking about self awareness. the virtual humanity statutes require us t o give them consciousness to the l e v e l of functionality. but not beyond.}
<A>__{this gives sanger pause. crowne drags her cigarette acutely.}
<C>__{crowne}
<D>__{l e g a l l y , we are naked on every level. federal legislature, state licensing, sponsorship contract... but even if we did manage to weather the legal storm, we'd never survive the public scrutiny.}
<A>__{s a n g e r absorbs this, calmly shaking a pill from his pill bottle.}
<C>__{dr. sanger}
<D>__{i've spent my entire career facing down naysayers, ellen. don't think for a second i'm afraid of facing them now.}
<C>__{crowne}
<D>__{you remember cryogenics? at the outset, people dismissed it as a rich man's folly. eccentric millionaires freezing their brains, hoping to wake up in a new body.}
<C>__{crowne }
<D>__{e v e n when cloning showed signs of m a k i n g it feasible, it wasn't moral a f f r o n t that caused the backlash. it w a s the scope. the scope, henry. when t h e size of the customer base was e x p o s e d , it screamed inequality one m e d i c i n e for the rich and one for the p o o r . the pressure for accessible cryo genics a s good as buried the industry.}
<P>__{( a pause for emphasis)}
<D>__{o u r graves are being dug as we speak, g e n t l e m e n . every passing second, they g e t deeper. if we're going to survive, w e have to act swiftly and decisively.}
<C>__{dr. sanger}
<D>__{a l r i g h t . what do you suggest?}
<A>__{s a n g e r dry swallows the pill. ellen opens a contract folder.}
<C>__{crowne}
<D>__{o u r security chief i've been looking at his file. ex marine, served in south china do we think he still has it in him?}
<C>__{dr. sanger}
<P>__{( r e a l i z i n g , suddenly harsh)}
<D>__{a r e you insane?}
<A>__{the i r eyes deadlock. crowne gives merrick a sideways glance.}
<C>__{crowne}
<D>__{` you ever wondered why henry takes those pills, bernard? why he doesn't avail himself of his own technology?}
<C>__{dr. sanger}
<D>__{an agnate could give me a new heart but to get it to function mentally...}
<C>__{crowne}
<D>__{b u l l s h i t , henry. bullshit. you don't want to deal with reality. only with concept. i may not have been there at the start but i heard the stories. you wanted in on every aspect of construction, from environmental design right down to the classical playlists. i t wasn't enough just to make it work, was it? no, you wanted your own little utopia.}
<C>__{crowne }
<D>__{swanning a r o u n d in your mountain r e t r e a t like some self appointed d e i t y . but when it comes to getting y o u r hands dirty...}
<C>__{dr. sanger}
<D>__{a r e you quite finished?}
<C>__{crowne}
<D>__{e v e n god has blood on his hands, henry. are you going to watch it all go up in flames or are you going to deal with it?}
<A>__{s a n g e r crosses to the window, looking down onto the city.}
<C>__{dr. sanger}
<D>__{you see that street down there...? running east from the stadium. my father used to take me to church on that street. an old spanish church.}
<C>__{crowne}
<D>__{what's your point?}
<C>__{dr. sanger}
<D>__{i didn't know they'd torn it down.}
