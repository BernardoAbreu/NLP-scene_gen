<L>__{exterior main street day}
<A>__{mariachi is walking around downtown acuna. he notices a bar across the street and, liking the way it looks, he puts on his jacket and crosses over to it. he stops to read a sign on the building that says "members and non members only". he prays silently to himself before confidently walking inside.}
<L>__{interior corona club day}
<A>__{mariachi enters the club, greeting the patrons as ge makes his way to the bar. no one seems to greet him back. he sits on a barstool near some other drinkers, laying his guitar case down lovingly beneath his stool. he looks around the place, as if sizing it up.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{what do you want to drink?}
<C>__{mariachi}
<D>__{refresco.}
<A>__{the other drinkers stare at him. glancing around the room, mariachi notices a small, table shaped object draped with a cloth in one corner of the room. sitting directly behind him are four mean looking dudes. mariachi is served his drink.}
<C>__{mariachi }
<D>__{no hay musica?}
<C>__{bartender}
<P>__{(cleaning a glass)}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{mariachi}
<D>__{i'm a mariachi. a good one. i play beautiful ballads, old classic ballads, on an old fashioned guitar.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{so what?}
<C>__{mariachi}
<D>__{i could add a little class to this place. i work for fairly cheap, i live mostly off tips. but i need steady work, and i can guarantee bringing in more customers.}
<C>__{bartender}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{tell me, why would i need one little guitar player when i've already got a full band?}
<A>__{mariachi gives him a silent "what" look. the bartender motions to a young man sitting near the small draped table. the young man removes the drape revealing a keyboard. puts on his mariachi hat, dips his fingers into his shot glass and rubs his fingers together (as if warming up for the big show). he hits a few switches in extreme closeup as... ... mariachi adjusts himself to the seat. the young men gently taps one switch and the keyboard sounds like an accordion, pulsing out a beat. he then presses another switch and a horn section swells to a crescendo and waltzes the familiar riffs. he adds the string and horns accents by banging on the keys. he sounds awful. mariachi grimaces slightly then turns back to the bartender who seems to enjoy it. the keyboard mariachi finishes his song, sits back down.}
<C>__{bartender }
<P>__{(nodding with satisfaction)}
<D>__{there you see? either i can pay one guy to sound like a full mariachi band...}
<A>__{mariachi picks up his guitar and lays some money next to his full drink. he looks disappointed.}
<C>__{bartender }
<D>__{... or i could spend the same money only get one little guitar player... understand?}
<C>__{mariachi}
<P>__{(walking away)}
<D>__{thank you, sir.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{you want to earn a living? get a real musical instrument.}
<A>__{the bartender picks up the bottle of soda pop mariachis left behind and offers it to the other men on the table. they say no, pay, and leave. the bartender offers it to the mean dudes at the table. they all shake their heads no. the bartender shrugs and dumps it.}
