<L>__{interior encom corporation sinclair's office day}
<A>__{sinclair and meg hang on the broken transmission:}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{rush?}
<A>__{words appear: end of line.}
<C>__{sinclair}
<D>__{he'd better not fail.}
<L>__{exterior ancient computer system i o port}
<A>__{d rezz screams like a modem, hurls romball mega and krod dive clear romball misses them, but blazes down two more i o ports. d rezz retrieves romball, bears down on mega and krod.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{hey! double points if you nail me! bring it on!}
<A>__{d rezz turns his ugly sights on rush, baited away from mega and krod. d rezz flexes and roars, revealing an x net logo on his chest.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{stop! end your routine!}
<A>__{d rezz corners rush, hurls his romball ball fires every circuit in its path, bleaching away data energy. rush dodges }
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{cease! desist! we're on the same team!}
<A>__{mega throws her disk, plings d rezz on the skull. d rezz turns on her rush runs, leaps on d rezz's back. like riding a gorilla d rezz flips rush to the ground, pins him with one mighty hand, raises his romball for the kill.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{i'm x net too!}
<A>__{data flows from rush's body, up d rezz's clamping arm. radiant energy between predator and prey. digits race in d rezz's eyes. a code unlocks. he looks down, finally registering the x net markings on rush's outfit. d rezz lets go of rush, slumps back on his haunches. lowers his head in shame.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{no, hey, hey big guy, don't take it so hard. we all have bad days.}
<A>__{rush rolls the big romball over: a peace offering. mega and krod cautiously approach.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{he was carrying out his programming. all i o ports are scheduled for de rezz.}
<A>__{d rezz hears this, happy to be understood. (he never talks.)}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{easy, big guy. no harm, no foul.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{d rezz, we can use a guy with your raw power. you ready to be a hero for x net?}
<A>__{d rezz stands, clutches his romball. reporting for duty.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{cool. now i've got somebody i can boss around.}
<A>__{d rezz modem growls at krod.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{or not.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{let's get to the game grid.}
<A>__{rush leads them up an incline.}
<C>__{mega}
<P>__{(grudgingly, to rush)}
<D>__{you have a skill for manipulating other programs.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{when do i get a shot at hacking your code?}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{never. our operating systems are incompatible.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{you act like i've got a virus.}
<A>__{they come to a spectacular vista of the old game grid. low resolution, uncool, largely forgotten.}
<C>__{krod}
<D>__{there it is.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{the place we nail tron.}
