<L>__{interior jerry maguire's office day}
<A>__{jerry enters his corner office overlooking both the shiny waters of newport beach and a large mall parking lot. already standing, reading the mail on his desk is lively marcee tidwell, 25. african american, gorgeous, a heat seeking smartbomb. she is also five months pregnant.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{marcee. how's my favorite player's wife?}
<C>__{marcee}
<D>__{jerry, rod is very very upset. tyson, no!}
<A>__{across the room, 4 year old menace tyson ceases trying to pry a plexiglass case off the wall.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{tyson, hello.}
<A>__{tyson just stares at jerry. jerry has little luck with kids. he gives marcee a quick peck and heads for the fridge. he grabs a two pint bottle of orange gatorade another habit and sits down at his desk. he slips into crisis mode like an old shirt.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{how can i make your life better?}
<C>__{marcee}
<D>__{i know you say to take the arizona offer, but my husband needs more recognition.}
<P>__{(more)}
<C>__{marcee }
<D>__{he is the biggest, fastest, raddest wide receiver in the league. now i don't know what you do for your four percent}
<A>__{ the door opens, bob sugar pokes his head in.}
<C>__{sugar}
<D>__{cronin's okay for lunch?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{marcee this is one of our agents. this is bob sugar, who needs to learn to knock.}
<C>__{sugar}
<D>__{pleasure.}
<C>__{marcee}
<D>__{you've called our house, right?}
<C>__{sugar}
<D>__{sorry to interrupt you guys.}
<A>__{sugar exits. marcee resumes at the exact point, at the exact level of intensity.}
<C>__{marcee}
<D>__{now i don't know what you do for your five percent, but this man, my husband has a whole plan, an image... we majored in marketing, jerry, and when you put him in a waterbed warehouse commercial, excuse me, you are making him common. he is pure gold and you're giving him "waterbed warehouse" when he deserves the big four shoe, car, clothing line, soft drink. the four jewels of the celebrity endorsement dollar.}
<A>__{jerry finds himself admiring her drive, and she commands the best in him. the desk buzzes, and jerry ignores it.}
<C>__{marcee}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you gonna get that }
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{not a chance.}
<A>__{she smiles.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{marcee, things are changing around here. you and rod will have my total personal attention.}
<C>__{marcee}
<P>__{(upping the ante)}
<D>__{damn right, and you can start by taking rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(it's infectious)}
<D>__{damn right.}
<A>__{he climbs up on the edge of his sofa, and reaches for the poster with his hanging device. true to marcee's complaint, the poster hangs in the upper siberian region of his wall.}
<C>__{marcee}
<D>__{look at that handsome man, trying to build a life up there by the air conditioner. we're coming to get ya, darlin! we are so close to having it all!}
<A>__{on the poster close it is the kind of poster that is strictly the domain of second tier players. commanding wide receiver rod tidwell,}
