<A>__{sam holds the now sleeping baby to his chest. next to him is the plastic bag from the hospital containing diapers, two cans of formula and a half empty bottle of milk. sam is surrounded by passengers, the eerie world of the underground at night. instinctively, sam holds her even tighter, two against the world.}
<L>__{interior sam's apartment dawn}
<A>__{a marvel of organization. a closet reveals clothes on hangers exactly equidistant from each other; precisely folded t shirts, underwear and socks organized by color. a carefully systemized record collection fills makeshift bookshelves. beatles posters from every era decorate the walls. becca's things sit in one corner. an island of chaos in an "hold everything" showroom. the kitchen counter has been transformed into a changing table. bottles and pacifiers lined up next to a stack of cloth diapers. underneath, a clothes line of baby clothes. the sound of a crying baby breaks the silence. the camera follows and finds the cradle: a drawer tucked snugly into a blanket hanging like a hammock between two chairs. an exhausted sam pops up from his bed, behind the hammock. he swings the hammock, hoping against hope the baby will go back to sleep.}

<D>__{didn't you just fall asleep, little girl?}
<P>__{(lucy cries harder)}
<D>__{okay, if you say it's time to get up, then it's time to get up, time to get up.}
<P>__{(sam sniffs the air)}
<D>__{oh my, oh my, oh my. quite a bit of business.}
<A>__{he rushes over to the kitchen counter and unsnaps the baby's pajamas, revealing a cloth diaper held together with promotional buttons: one says "hertz, #1 for car rentals", the other a picture of magic johnson and reads "go, lakers, go!" sam undoes it.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. let me see let me see let me see.}
<A>__{sam attempts to clean and diaper her. he finally manages to pin the buttons so that it at least stays on.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{you look very beautiful this morning, very beautiful.}
<A>__{he holds her up, and the diaper falls down around her ankles.}
