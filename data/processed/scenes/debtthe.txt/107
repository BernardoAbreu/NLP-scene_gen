<L>__{interior living room day}
<A>__{stephan knows he's watched and avoids vogel's gaze until he can stand it no longer and looks...}
<B>__{kitchen}
<A>__{david is the first to break through the blocks his fist stopping inches from stephen's face. the two men freeze, staring at each other, breathing hard. the music crashes to a halt.}
<B>__{living room}
<A>__{stephan is staring at vogel. he begins to play the anthem more discordantly, hitting the keys more violently, as if the music is possessing him. then suddenly he stops, stands up and walks away from the keyboard. stares at vogel. vogel is very aware of the sudden change in atmosphere, a sense of impending violence. stephan doesn't move. the moment hangs.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{david is taking over the shift from stephan. they pass each other in the doorway without a word. david stops, staring... vogel lies in his usual place. a sack has been placed over his head, hooding him. the effect is deeply sinister. kitchen moments later stephan sits eating with rachel. david walks in and throws the sack on the table. stephan glances at it, continues eating.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{stephan}
<D>__{it's your shift.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(to rachel)}
<D>__{did you know about this?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(to stephan)}
<D>__{his mouth's taped. you want him to suffocate?}
<C>__{stephan}
<D>__{i was sick of seeing his face. go back in.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{don't do that again.}
<A>__{stephan gets up and walks calmly towards david as if shooing him back out the room.}
<C>__{stephan}
<D>__{you don't give orders david. it's your shift now so you can go back in there...}
<A>__{he has his hands on david's chest, gently pushing him back. david takes his hold of the hands, pulling them free and suddenly there's a flurry of violent movement as stephan yanks his arms free of david and the two men shove at each other.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{stop it!}
<A>__{they stop, breathing hard.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{we're not animals. just remember what we are. remember what we're not.}
<A>__{he walks back out. stephan sits back at the table, starts eating again. he glances at rachel, but she won't look at him. after a moment she gets up and walks out.}
