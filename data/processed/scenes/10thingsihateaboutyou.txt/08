<D>__{the vintage look is over, kat. haven't you been reading your sassy?}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{yeah, and i noticed the only part of you featured in your big kmart spread was your elbow. tough break.}
<C>__{joey}
<P>__{(practically spitting)}
<D>__{they're running the rest of me next month.}
<A>__{he zooms away as kat yanks open the door of her dart. mandella ties a silk scarf around her head, as if they're in a convertible.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{the people at this school are so incredibly foul.}
<C>__{mandella}
<D>__{you could always go with me. i'm sure william has some friends.}
<A>__{they watch joey's car as he slows next to bianca and chastity as they walk toward the school bus.}

<A>__{mandella lowers her sunglasses to watch.}
<C>__{mandella}
<D>__{that's a charming new development}
<A>__{kat doesn't answer, but reaches over and puts a tape in the tape deck. the sounds of joyful punk rock fill the car. as they pull out, michael crosses in front of them on his moped. kat has to slam the brakes to keep from hitting him}
<C>__{kat}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{remove head from sphincter! then pedal!}
<A>__{michael begins fearfully, pedaling as kat peels out, angry at the delay. cameron rushes over}

<D>__{you all right?}
<A>__{he slows to a stop}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{that's her? bianca's sister?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{the mewling, rampalian wretch herself.}
<A>__{michael putters off, leaving cameron dodging patrick's grimy, grey jeep a vehicle several years and many paint jobs away from its former glory as a regulation mail truck as he sideswipes several cars on his way out of the lot.}
