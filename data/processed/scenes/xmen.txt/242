<L>__{interior mansion day}
<A>__{the celebration continues unabated. the newscaster on the defeat of the mutant registration act muted, in the background storm, jean, and cyclops all sit around a table chatting. rogue sits on the couch with other students, trying on a new pair of leather gloves.}
<C>__{xavier }
<D>__{excuse me.}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{xavier is in the doorway.}
<C>__{xavier }
<D>__{everyone, logan would like to say...}
<A>__{logan steps into the doorway. everyone can see him now. before xavier can finish his sentence he is interrupted by applause simple, genuine, applause. students slowly stand up. proud of logan. for he is one of them. he is a mutant. and he is a hero. as the unconditional applause echoes around him, logan seems sincerely touched by their spontaneous outpouring. he is almost choked up almost. the applause quiet.}
<C>__{xavier }
<D>__{well, logan.}
<A>__{all eyes are on logan. logan pauses. he looks to xavier, then back to the room.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{whatis a guy gotta do to get a beer around here?}
<A>__{logan puts his duffle bag down. he walks over to the table with storm, cyclops and jean. jean smiles at him, so does cyclops his arm around the back of her chair. logan sees them together, they are happy, and finally he offers a smile. xavier holds for a moment at the door. a look of pride on his face, the pride a father has for his children.}
