<A>__{bob and charlotte go up to a cab, but the driver refuses them. they don't know why, but just make their way down an empty side street. little plastic cherry blossom decorations hang above them.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{where's your husband?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<P>__{(like she's said it a million times)}
<D>__{working.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{do you ever see him?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<P>__{(sorta)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{do you know where we are?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{she puts a coin in a vending machine and takes a cold sake "one cup". a tiny brad pitt head smiles at her next to an iced coffee.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{isn't it weird there are no street names in tokyo... you'd think a city like this would have street names... you need a map to get anywhere... look, there are no signs...}
