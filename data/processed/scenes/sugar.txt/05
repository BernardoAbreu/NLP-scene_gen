<L>__{exterior academy field day}
<A>__{the kansas city director of minor league operations, rudy hubbard (white, 40s), watches a tryout session, where two skinny teens in worn street clothes pitch to uniformed catchers. their agent talks on a cell phone nearby. alvarez, the academy director, approaches one of the kids, whispers in his ear. the kid smiles tentatively. alvarez joins rudy and they speak in english.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{what'd you tell him?}
<C>__{alvarez}
<D>__{i told him to grip the ball more gently. like a tit.}
<A>__{they both crack up. from the tryout mound. the kid looks over to the two men pow wowing about him. he breathes in, nervous... batting cage minutes later pedro, sweating hard, takes a few cuts, but only seems to be hitting weak ground balls and foul tips.}
<C>__{alvarez}
<D>__{pedro berroa. third year. hasn't developed like we hoped.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{how much he sign for?}
<C>__{alvarez}
<D>__{forty five.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{jesus. these kids keep getting more expensive. how much did you sign for back in the day?}
<C>__{alvarez}
<D>__{3000. when i was fifteen.}
<A>__{rudy smiles and moves on. alvarez follows. pedro watches the men as they walk away. bull pen mounds minutes later alvarez and rudy approach a pitching coach instructing salvador. miguel warms up next to him.}
<C>__{alvarez}
<D>__{salvador torres. been practicing with the team for almost a week. still raw, but he's got a lot of potential.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{we gonna sign him?}
<C>__{alvarez}
<D>__{soon. soon. we want to play it low key, see what his agent says.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{how much you think?}
<C>__{alvarez}
<D>__{they've gotten two offers from other clubs. agent says they were around a hundred.}
<A>__{rudy raises his eyebrows.}
<C>__{alvarez}
<P>__{(firm)}
<D>__{he's good.}
<A>__{rudy looks over to miguel.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{what about him?}
<C>__{alvarez}
<D>__{miguel santos. great arm. we signed him two years ago for fifteen.}
<A>__{miguel fires in a pitch. rudy nods, impressed.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{good deal. he throw any junk?}
<C>__{alvarez}
<P>__{(in spanish)}
<D>__{sugar!}
<A>__{miguel looks over, sees the american with alvarez.}
<C>__{alvarez}
<D>__{show us your curve.}
<A>__{miguel nods, nervous, focuses. he pitches. the ball curves very subtly over the plate for a strike.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{not bad. mind if i try something?}
<A>__{miguel looks back to the men.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{hey, kid, do you mind? may i?}
<A>__{miguel stares blankly at rudy, not understanding.}
<C>__{alvarez}
<P>__{(in spanish)}
<D>__{give him the ball.}
<A>__{miguel hands rudy the ball, and rudy demonstrates how to handle a knuckle curve ball, which looks strangely unorthodox, with the index finger tucked against the baseball.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{spike curve. gives you more rotation, more movement.}
<P>__{(hands miguel the ball)}
<D>__{you try.}
<A>__{miguel struggles to emulate rudy's grip, so rudy maneuvers his fingers into the correct position. alvarez laughs.}
<C>__{alvarez}
<D>__{vamos! let's go! pitch it!}
<A>__{miguel looks over to his catcher, jose. winds up the next pitch, and soars it 5 feet wide of the mark. rudy and alvarez laugh. miguel looks back over his shoulder.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{it's okay, son, these things take time. you'll figure it out.}
<A>__{rudy pats miguel on the back and walks off with alvarez. miguel stares at them hard as they go. he turns back to his catcher, determined, squeezes the ball in spike curve formation. delivers. misses badly again. jump cuts take us through a half dozen more bad curve attempts, as other players take notice and gather around, some laughing, until... ...finally a perfect curve twists dramatically through the air, landing centered in jose's mitt. the other players erupt in amazement, while miguel stares straight ahead. after a beat, he smiles wide.}
