<L>__{interior national gallery. cartoon room entrance day}
<A>__{bean is passing the very special room where leonardo da vinci's cartoon, 'the virgin and child', hangs, preserved by a very dim artificial light. there are silhouettes of a few tourists in the room reverently studying the work, listening to a female gallery guide. bean dips into his pocket for his identity badge and in so doing brings out a coin. the coin drops and rolls into the special room. bean follows it into the darkness.}

<D>__{... by leonardo da vinci. as you can see, the special light in here goes some way to protect the drawing from photodisintegration caused by gamma ...}
<A>__{the camera stays outside the room with the picture in view. we hear the squeak of a tiny door open, then a click. the room is suddenly flooded in blazing white light. the onlookers gasp in horror. bean re emerges from the room with his precious coin. as an afterthought he pops his hand round the doorway and turns off the light. he scuttles away. the gallery guide shakes her head in total exasperation.}
