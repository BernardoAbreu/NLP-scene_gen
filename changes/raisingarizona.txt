Faraway lightning flickers and we hear the rumble of more thunder approaching, then suddenly: THWACK - A head pops up out of the mud. It is Gale, the con we saw in group therapy. He bellows as lightning and thunder flash and crack nearby. His head is covered with mud, although the driving rain is already starting to wash it away. We are beginning to track in an arc around Gale's head, who is now struggling, working to get his shoulders and arms up out of the mud. The end of the 180-degree arc and a flash of lightning reveal, way in the distance, the wire-topped walls of a penitentiary. Still bellowing, as if in some primal rage, Gale has gotten his muck-covered arms up out of the earth and is now pushing down to haul up the rest of his body. It comes with much effort, and with the loud sucking-popping sounds of the fiercely clinging mud. Finally he is free. With a great cry, the mud-covered man plunges his right arm straight back down into the earth, all the way up to his shoulder. He gropes intently and then, apparently having grabbed hold of something underground, he starts pulling. His arm comes slowly back up out of the mud. Clasped in his hand is - a human foot. Bellowing with effort he continues to pull, liberating the foot... leg... torso of his companion, and finally his head. As the rain starts to wash the mud off his companion's head we see that it is his friend Evelle. Both are bellowing. Mud sucks and pops. Thunder crashes.}

One cop in front of him is pointing a direction. The Biker is shaking his head; he doesn't think they went that way. Suddenly, with a loud whipcrack effect, the Biker's head snaps to profile.

Hi grabs at his knuckles in pain. Gale lunges with a mid- body tackle that sends Hi crashing into the wall. Gale, still on top of him, reaches back to throw a punch.

Hi's head bobs sideways just in time and Gale's fist goes through the wall. It is momentarily stuck there. Hi uses the opportunity to grab Gale's one free arm with both of his.

He grabs a lath exposed by the hole and pulls; it tears out of the wall and snaps free, giving him a length of about two feet. Gale is rampaging around like a grizzly bear hemmed in a too- small space.
