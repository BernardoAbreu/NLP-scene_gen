<A>__{a popular song rocks the gymnasium. cheerleaders dance on the sidelines. students and parents cheer wildly from the packed stands. julie gabs with a group of teachers. on one end of the court, the falcons run a pass and shoot drill. on the opposite end, a team in blue shoots around. mike sees scarlet and maggie enter. he smiles apologetically to them. both turn away, climb the bleachers, join nicole and the wonder bras.}

<D>__{let's go! remember, boys, winners get the girls. losers please themselves!}
<A>__{mike and the falcons jog onto the court. mike takes his place for the jump ball. the crowd stomps, cheers loudly. mike looks around the gymnasium... it almost seems to slow up... the sound deafening. he finds alex on the bench... his hopeful face. mike looks into the stands... maggie and scarlet. scarlet abruptly stands, climbs back down the bleachers and exits the gym. the ref readies to toss the ball. mike takes a deep breath... and walks off the court.}
