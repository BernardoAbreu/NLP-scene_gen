<L>__{interior suburban house day}
<A>__{a distraught middle aged couple, mr. and mrs. hickson, sit on the couch of their living room. family photos show them with julia, whose fiancee, john, does his best to comfort the mother. novak and ramsey have the unfortunate task of interviewing them about their daughter's disappearance.}
<C>__{ramsey}
<D>__{she was still living at home?}
<C>__{mr. hickson}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{we were looking at apartments.}
<C>__{mr. hickson}
<P>__{(important they know)}
<D>__{but nobody was moving in together 'til after the wedding.}
<A>__{novak hasn't said much. instead, he looks at something in his hands a plastic evidence bag containing the toy doll.}
<C>__{ramsey}
<D>__{john, you came to pick her up when?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{eight o'clock. we were going out for my birthday.}
<C>__{mr. hickson}
<D>__{maybe you made a mistake. maybe she... she...}
<A>__{novak hides the doll.}
<C>__{ramsey}
<D>__{no sir. i'm sorry.}
<A>__{ramsey's cell phone rings and he excuses himself to a corner of the room, leaving novak alone to deal with this uncomfortable, sad situation, no one saying a word until an emotionally shattered mrs. hickson, fingering a rosary, feels compelled to tell him.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{after three years she remembers what the guy drove?}
<C>__{ramsey}
<D>__{she remembers because it was her "dream truck." wanted one just like it.}
