<L>__{interior church day}
<A>__{a month later. mr deng and bunuel drag henry, kicking and screaming, into the church foyer. once inside, he shakes them off and they stand back. he huffs and puffs and tosses the hair back out of his eyes. he paces back and forth like a caged animal, then stops, sees... fay, at the altar, waiting with simon. she is beautiful. henry calms down, deeply affected. fay smiles down the aisle at him. henry throws back his shoulders, straightens his tie and strides up the aisle. also present at the ceremony are vicky and warren. gnoc is maid of honor.}
