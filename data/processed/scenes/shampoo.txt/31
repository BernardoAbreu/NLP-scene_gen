<L>__{exterior lester's house in bel air day}
<A>__{george pulls into the circular driveway. covered by a few bars of the mama's and the papa's "california dreamin." there's only one car. george gets off the bike and goes to the door. nobody answers. he hears the sound of a ball banging. he looks toward the tennis court. on the court lorna is banging away on the backboard. there's a basket of balls nearby. she hits with considerable skill and power until she misses the backboard and the ball lodges in the steel mesh surrounding the court. george is standing there. lorna looks at him.}
