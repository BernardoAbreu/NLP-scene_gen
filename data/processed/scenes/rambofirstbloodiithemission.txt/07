<L>__{interior cell}
<A>__{tight on a hand, dimly outlined, as it twists a light bulb a half turn in its socket. in the sudden light the mps face an imposing figure. john rambo, wearing only a pair of filthy jeans, stands "ready" before them. the single light bulb on the low ceiling sends glistening highlights over his taught body. a nasty piece of machinery. long, matted hair coils onto his shoulders, and an unkempt beard heightens the cheekbones beneath eyes which are deep, reptilian. intense. his position, though not overtly threatening, suggests a willingness to strike without warning which gives the m.p.'s pause. trautman steps forward between the mps.}
<C>__{trautman}
<D>__{at ease, rambo.}
<B>__{med. on rambo}
<A>__{rising from his slight crouch to stand composed, balanced... parade rest.}
<C>__{trautman}
<P>__{(continuing to mps)}
<D>__{wait outside.}
<A>__{he closes the door until it latches.}
<C>__{trautman}
<D>__{hello, john.}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{colonel.}
<C>__{trautman}
<D>__{mind if i sit down?}
<A>__{rambo motions to the narrow bunk, dropping into an oriental squat himself as the colonel sits. trautman's manner with rambo is familiar, somehow paternal. a bit of an ironic grin twitches briefly.}
<C>__{trautman}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i hear you're not enjoying it here.}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{i could take it or leave it.}
<A>__{trautman sighs and leans back.}
<C>__{trautman}
<D>__{seems like i'm always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other, doesn't it?}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{am i out of here?}
<C>__{trautman}
<D>__{that depends on you.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{christ, look at you. i give you this easy duty until i can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it rambo's last stand.}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{there were treating me like a headcase.}
<C>__{trautman}
<D>__{hard to believe. you shoot up one little town in oregon with a fifty caliber machine gun... one little dogpatch town... and everybody figures your wrapper's broken. no sense of humor.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{what did you expect? an engraved plague from the chamber of commerce?}
<A>__{rambo looks at his hands. when he finally speaks his voice seems distant, disembodied.}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{in 'nam i flew gunships. million dollar equipment. back here nobody trusts me to park cars. i keep thinking it's going to be okay... but i've been out six years and it's not okay. sometimes i feel like i'm coming right out of my skin.}
<A>__{the colonel nods slowly. he notices a battered shoebox on the floor beside the bed. the cell is absolutely devoid of personal articles otherwise.}
<C>__{trautman}
<D>__{this your stuff?}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{that's it. my life.}
<B>__{tight on shoebox}
<A>__{as trautman flips through a number of worn snapshots of the men in rambo's special forces unit. they are horsing around, in and out of uniform. a younger, cleanshaven rambo is among them. he is grinning broadly in one shot. it seems uncharacteristic of the hardened man we see now.}
<C>__{trautman}
<D>__{hardcore outfit. the best i ever trained.}
<C>__{rambo}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{those men are all dead.}
<C>__{trautman}
<P>__{(glancing up)}
<D>__{you're not.}
<A>__{he fishes something from among the pathetic debris of rambo's life.}
<C>__{trautman}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{congressional medal of honor.}
<C>__{rambo}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{yeah. big time.}
<C>__{trautman}
<D>__{plus, what else? two silver stars, four bronze stars, two soldier's medals, four vietnamese crosses of gallantry and... uh, a handful of purple hearts.}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{five. i never wanted that stuff.}
<C>__{trautman}
<D>__{what did you want?}
<C>__{rambo}
<P>__{(haltingly)}
<D>__{i just wanted... i don't know... after all that... i just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, john." and mean it. that's all.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{after all that.}
<C>__{trautman}
<D>__{you just picked that wrong war to be a hero in.}
<A>__{the colonel studies rambo a moment, then stands abruptly.}
<C>__{trautman}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{let's take a walk.}
