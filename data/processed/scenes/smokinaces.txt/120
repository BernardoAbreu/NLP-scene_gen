<A>__{watters puts her eye to the scope, scans, finds sykes in the crosshairs across the way, adjusting her outfit. watters settles on her, watches...something vaguely creepy about this bit of voyeurism. she nuzzles the barrett close.}
<C>__{watters}
<D>__{mmmm. i tell you, i snuggle up with big girl here and my pussy start t'drip.}
