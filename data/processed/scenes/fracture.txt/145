<T>__{intercut quick flashbacks:}
<A>__{crawford fires at jennifer }
<C>__{willy }
<D>__{then three more out the front of the house, to get some attention.}
<A>__{ and fires three times at the transom.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{then while you're waiting for the show to begin you have to reload nunally's gun.}
<A>__{crawford pushes new bullets into the clip }
<C>__{willy }
<D>__{i mean, you don't want him wondering where the hell four bullets went, considering he never fired his gun that night.}
<A>__{ and slides the clip back into the gun, pleased. willy nods, thinking it out. sure of himself. he sets the ball bearing into the slot at the top of the machine }
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{and i'm betting you didn't worry about fingerprints.}
<A>__{crawford reacts. close: crawford's fingers, putting the bullets in the clip. willy lets the ball go watching it begin rolling down the ornate tracks.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i mean, why would you? nobody's going to be looking at his gun.}
<A>__{the ball tumbles and clatters flipping and clicking through the ingenious, precise, heartless machinery }
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{and sooner or later, life goes on, those four incriminating bullets would get used, and be gone forever.}
<A>__{ and crawford is recognizing, slowly, his one mistake. the gun in nunally's limp dead fingers, glimpsed on the marble courthouse floor, through the crowd.}
<C>__{willy }
<D>__{except nunally only fired one of those bullets. into himself.}
<A>__{willy turns from the machine which continues clattering and working, beside him.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{which means there are still three left with your fingerprints on them tom. in this clip.}
<A>__{he holds the gun up. savoring crawford's growing fear. they can hear a car rolling up the driveway. red and blue lights sweep the frosted glass by the front door.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{everybody has a weak spot, right? some place they break.}
<A>__{without looking, willy gently pushes the machine, moving it a fraction of an inch on the floor as the ball catapults out sailing across the living room in a perfect, graceful arc that misses the bowl. outside, the police car doors open and then slam. crawford, going pale, watches the metal ball roll off the coffee table and across the floor toward him. crawford doesn't move. trying to focus. his mind working. the ball comes to rest against crawford's shoe. the doorbell rings. crawford looks up. meeting willy's eyes. smiling slightly, willy tucks nunally's gun into his belt and puts his hands in the air. and gives crawford a wink. crawford is staring at willy, frozen panic and hatred and fear curdling in his eyes as behind him, the police begin pounding on the front door.}
