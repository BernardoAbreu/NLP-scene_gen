<L>__{interior henry's apartment day}
<A>__{henry is shaving. simon sits in the kitchen, sorting through rejection letters...}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{dear mr grim, we here at the magazine consider ourselves and the publication open minded and cutting edge and have consistently printed the work of the most brilliant and farseeing young talent of the day. every week we are forced to return writing which we can not for one reason or another publish and include a brief but polite refusal. but this tract you've sent us demands a response as violent as the effect your words have had upon us. drop dead. keep your day job. sincerely, the editors.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{de gustibus non disputandum est.}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{you can't argue with taste?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{about taste. you can't argue about taste. god, simon.}
<A>__{simon gives up and pushes the letters away, beaten.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{the other twenty five are almost as bad. i don't know why i bother.}
<A>__{henry drops his razor and stomps out into the hall.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{what do you mean you don't know why you bother? you bother because you know the poem is excellent!}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{do i?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{of course you do!}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i'm not so sure sometimes.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{can you sit there, look me straight in the eye, and tell me you don't think this poem is great? that it is not at once a work of great lyrical beauty and ethical depth? that it is not a genuine, highly individual, and profound meditation on the miracle of existence?}
<A>__{simon holds the stare, overwhelmed.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i, ah...}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{can you?}
<A>__{simon looks away, thinks a moment, then looks back at henry.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{no. i can't.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{so, you see, you have no choice!}
<A>__{he goes back into the bathroom. simon thinks a while, then...}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{can you recommend it to your friend, the publisher?}
<A>__{no response.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{henry? can you recommend the poem to him?}
<A>__{still no response. simon gets up and stands in the bathroom doorway. henry is shaving.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i mean, i think it's finished and, for better or worse, it is book length.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{that might not be as easy as it seems.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{well, it's been a long time. my name might not carry as much weight as it once did with angus.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{but he's your friend, right?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{we were close at one time.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{you said he respected your opinion.}
<A>__{henry puts down his razor and looks at simon in the mirror.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{look, simon, opinions come and go.}
<A>__{he sees simon looks worried.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{to be honest; my ideas, my writing, they haven't always been received well or even calmly. they're upsetting. i'm a controversial man.}
<A>__{he walks around the bathroom, gesticulating.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{you see, what i'm doing is too radical. too uncompromising. it'll take time for people to see its value. it's ahead of its time, perhaps, or maybe just...}
<P>__{(stops)}
<D>__{a recommendation from me might do you as much harm as it does good.}
<A>__{simon patiently absorbs all this, then walks through the kitchen and looks across at the 'confession' notebooks.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{henry, why can't i read the 'confession'?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{because certain work needs to be experienced all at once in order for one to appreciate the full force of its character.}
