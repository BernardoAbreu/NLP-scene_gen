<A>__{still, bond climbs. huffing, sweating, he goes up, and up, until another angle he's 25 feet from the top. he drives a first ice pick in. gets a toehold. but when he slams the second pick in the ice wall shatters, falling away in front of him. in the shock bond loses his grip on the first ice pick and 007 is now dangling, 575 feet in the air, staring at a torrent of water hanging only by the leather thread around his wrist, attached to the first ice pick, still embedded in the wall. bond pauses. thinks. and coolly begins to swing himself back and forth, in widening arcs, like a clock's pendulum. at the high point of his swing, bond reaches back to smash his other pick into the ice but misses. he looks up at: the first ice pick, still embedded in the wall beginning to work its way out. the tether, fraying. return on bond cautiously, 007 begins to swing a second time. once. twice. and on the third arc, he swings the ice pick viciously but misses again. angle on the first ice pick, still embedded in the wall now jutting downward, barely holding. the tether is almost totally frayed through. return on bond one last chance. bond swings. once. twice. he reaches back, hurls himself at the wall, lunging and smashes the second pick into the ice... just as the tether finally snaps on the first one. still, he's all but home: he reaches over, grabs the first pick (barely holding in the ice,) jabs it in, and continues upward.}

<L>__{interior press room }
<A>__{bond and sidney enter at the top of the metal stairs bond came down earlier to meet harmsway. the presses are running full blast; the noise is deafening. at the "start" end of the presses where the paper is fed in bond sees a giant roll of newsprint on a crane, about to be loaded. directly beyond this is the door to the elevator wash up room where bond and harmsway exited earlier. coming out of that door, bond sees three guards in harmsway blazers carrying guns. bond shoots the hook on the crane carrying the newsprint roll. it crashes to the ground, rolling backwards on the guards. as they start scrambling around it bond and sidney race down the stairs, turning in the opposite direc tion (toward the finishing end of the press, near the garage...) they encounter a gorilla sized pressman, with an oversized crowbar. bond and the pressman square off. bond tries to get around him. the man lifts his crowbar to smash bond with it. bond tries to block the descending crowbar with his gun but the crowbar snaps it in half. bond and the pressman engage in a short, furious fight throwing each other against the side of the press... which ends when bond finally gets the upper hand for a second, and pushes the man back, into a pile of ink drums. momentarily stunned, bond forces the man's head into an open ink drum and as he comes up, covered with ink, gasping for air, sidney bops him on the head with the crowbar. now, bond and sidney take off, toward the garage exit but one of the guards (from the crashing roll of newsprint) darts out from between the banks of the printing press, tripping bond. bond stumbles, face down then spins over, kicking up at the guard as he comes to finish bond off. the guard stumbles backward crashing against a newspaper baling machine. (a large machine that wraps steel or plastic bands around bundles of papers for delivery.) rushing the man, bond struggles with him and manages to flip the baling switch literally tying the man up. the only problem is that as bond turns the last guard has sidney in a choke hold; he's aiming a gun at bond. seemingly at once, (1) sidney bites the guard's forearm, (2) bond ducks, (3) the guard shoots wildly, (4) the gun drops, and (5) bond rushes the man, knocking him backwards into the printing press, pulling sidney away at the last moment. the guard is sucked up in the press rollers, and... the pages running through the newsprint web suddenly turn bright red.}
