<L>__{interior nix's house meditation room night}
<A>__{harry is staring up at dorothea as he very gingerly crosses the still sticky ground. he's a yard from the edge of the pit now. nix swings round.}
<C>__{nix}
<D>__{you're not swann. who are you?}
<P>__{(a beat) )}
<D>__{oh... i know what you want. he lets dorothea slip from his arms.}
<A>__{harry flings himself towards the hole and catches hold of dorothea's arm before she falls away into the abyss. his gun goes spinning across the ground, back towards the door leading to the passageway.}
<C>__{dorothea}
<D>__{oh god!}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{hang on!}
<A>__{nix reaches down to torment harry. but before he can make contact}
<C>__{swann }
<D>__{nix!}
<A>__{nix looks up.}
<C>__{nix}
<D>__{there you are.}
<A>__{suddenly, nix isn't interested in harry and dorothea. he steps onto solid ground, and walks towards swann, his tone suddenly conversational.}
<C>__{nix}
<D>__{i've had a lot of time to think about you. where i went wrong...}
<A>__{with nix's back turned, harry pulls dorothea back out of the chasm.}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{and?}
<C>__{nix}
<D>__{i should have been honest with you, right from the start. i wasn't born to show people the error of their ways. i was born to murder the world.}
<A>__{on harry, as he leads dorothea to the door. harry glances back into the room.}
<C>__{nix}
<D>__{you could still help me do that.}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{why would i want to?}
<C>__{nix}
<D>__{because you've got nothing else to live for.}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{not true.}
<C>__{nix}
<D>__{the woman has a new love in her life. your friends are dead. nobody's left to save you, but me}
<A>__{he lays his hands on swann. draws him into an embrace. on harry and dorothea.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(to dorothea)}
<D>__{i've got to help him.}
<C>__{dorothea}
<D>__{you can't.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{nix has got to have a weak spot. everybody's got a fucking weak spot.}
<A>__{a noise. he turns, and suddenly butterfield is there! his face is horribly burned, but he's still very much alive.}
<C>__{butterfield}
<D>__{bastard!}
<A>__{he launches himself at harry, driving them both back into the broken glass. a fight ensues, carrying them out into the passageway. nix has swann in a bear hug.}
<C>__{nix}
<D>__{will you help me?}
<A>__{a beat. then swann nods.}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{nix lets him go.}
<C>__{nix}
<D>__{you know i will kill you when we're done. i have to.}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{nix}
<D>__{but until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{dorothea, at the doorway, watches this bizarre exchange. swann's eyes flicker towards her. nix turns.}
<C>__{nix}
<D>__{wait... you still feel something for that bitch?}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{nix}
<D>__{liar!}
<A>__{nix makes a gesture, and swann is flung against the wall, pinned there like a fly, legs off the ground.}
<C>__{nix}
<D>__{will! you! never! learn!?}
<A>__{with each word, nix almost casually throws a gesture in swann's direction, and though there is six feet between them, they have the force of terrible blows. one to the ribs. they crack. one to the face. it bleeds. one to the legs, one to the arms. they all break. then nix turns towards dorothea.}
<C>__{nix}
<D>__{she's just flesh, swannnie boy. i will show you!}
<A>__{he moves towards dorothea. swann falls to the ground, broken.}
<C>__{swann}
<D>__{harry!}
