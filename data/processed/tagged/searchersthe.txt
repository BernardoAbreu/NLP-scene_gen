<A>__{level a study of hoofprints late afternoon the hoofprints are deeply etched in the ground, picking their way through scrubby desert growth. an occasional tumbleweed drifts with the light breeze across the pattern of prints; and lightly blown soil and sand begin the work of erasing them. the camera following the hoofprints}
<T>__{raises slowly to:}
<L>__{exterior plains country long shot late afternoon}
<A>__{we see the rider now. back to camera, jogging slowly along heading down a long valley toward a still distant ranch house with its outlying barn and corrals.}
<L>__{exterior plains country med. shot moving late afternoon}
<A>__{the camera frames and moves with the lone horseman. he is ethan edwards, a man as hard as the country he is crossing. ethan is in his forties, with a three day stubble of beard. dust is caked in the lines of his face and powders his clothing. he wears a long confederate overcoat, torn at one pocket, patched and clumsily stitched at the elbows. his trousers are a faded blue with an off color stripe down the legs where once there had been the yellow stripes of the yankee cavalry. his saddle is mexican and across it he carries a folded serape in place of the texas poncho... rider and horse have come a long way. the camera holds and pans the rider past and we see another detail; strapped onto his saddle roll is a sabre and scabbard with a gray silk sash wrapped around it... horse and rider pass, moving closer to the ranch as a little girl and a small dog come tearing around the corner of the house.}

<B>__{late afternoon}
<A>__{she is staring wide eyed at the distant horseman o.s. her little dog has seen him too and is barking excitedly. debbie quickly reaches to grab the dog by the scruff of the neck, crouching over him. debbie is 11 years old with a piquant, memorable face.}
<L>__{exterior the yard close shot debbie}
<A>__{here we must establish and dramatize what it is about her face that is memorable, so that if we were to see her again five or six years later, we would know it is she perhaps the eye color or the slant of eyebrow, or a trick of scratching bridge of nose with crooked forefinger.}
<L>__{exterior the edwards house med. shot aaron late afternoon}
<A>__{the ranch house is of adobe, solidly built, with a sod and cross timbered roof, deep windows. a small gallery or porch extends across the front. aaron edwards comes through the door, attracted by the dog's barking and then he, too, sees the approaching horseman and comes farther out curious but not at all apprehensive. aaron is a lean, weathered and tired man, with a down swept mustache; a gentler looking man than ethan and possibly a few years older. as he squints off, studying the rider, his older daughter, lucy, comes out to stand behind him. lucy is from 16 to 18 a pleasant, feminine girl. she is carrying a mixing bowl with some sort of batter in it, which she now completely forgets to whip in her interest in the approaching stranger. in the next instant martha edwards follows the daughter onto the porch. martha is a still lovely woman, although the years have etched fine wrinkles about her eyes and mouth, and work has worn and coarsened her hands. those hands will never be idle when martha is on scene... and now, while she shares the family's interest in the approaching horseman, she automatically notes that lucy has forgotten her task and she takes the mixing bowl from her and stirs the batter.}
<L>__{exterior yard of the edwards house full shot late afternoon}
<A>__{along the side of the house comes ben edwards, 14, with a man sized armload of chunkwood clutched to his chest. he, too, has spotted the stranger and is all attention. so much so that he trips, but recovers his footing. he pauses to dump the wood into a woodbox by the door his eyes always riveted on the oncoming rider and then he moves toward the others, biting a splinter out of a finger. beyond ben, martin pauley emerges from the barn and crosses the open ground heading toward camera. martin is somewhat under 20, a lithe, perfectly coordinated male animal, with indian straight hair and a white man's eyes. he is carrying bridle or other horse gear. he looks to the family on the porch to see if they recognize the stranger then out again. he continues, followed by ben, toward where debbie crouches over her dog.}

<A>__{the family is finishing dinner and the scene is not quite, but almost, a still life. loud in the room is the pendulum tick of a seth thomas clock on the mantel above the fireplace in which logs are burning briskly. ben crouches near the fireplace, fascinatedly examining the scabbard and sabre ethan has brought home from the wars. he tries to ease the blade just a bit out of its scabbard. aaron sits at one end of the hand hewn table, martha at the other. at her right is ethan, his fork scraping the last crumb off his plate. lucy sits at her father's right and martin at his left. next to martin is debbie. in the center of the table is the sorry remnant of what was once a meal. lucy and martin have finished eating. aaron is sipping his coffee, and martha her own plate largely untasted is watching ethan. ethan has shaved, changed his shirt. he straightens contentedly and every eye is on him, expectantly.}

<A>__{he glances questioningly at ethan.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{so?}
<A>__{aaron shrugs and crosses to a barrel chair. he raises the seat and lifts out a pair of old boots, some rags of clothing and then raises a false bottom lid and drops pouch and money belt into it. carefully he replaces everything. during this ethan's attention has gone to martha's hand, to one cut finger, its wound barely healed. he takes the hand gently.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{cut yourself?}
<A>__{she nods and withdraws the hand.}
<C>__{ethan}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{you were always hurting about your hands.}
<A>__{she looks quickly at him and self consciously tries to hide her hands, conscious of their work worn appearance. then for a moment their eyes meet and hold and a world of sadness and hopelessness is in the look. aaron closes the seat of the barrel chair.}

<A>__{he picks up one of the lamps and starts away toward their bedroom door. martha looks at ethan again. his expression is bitter.}

<A>__{she turns obediently and follows aaron. ethan looks after them and waits as aaron opens the bedroom door. martha goes into it and aaron follows and closes the door. ethan crosses to the lamp on the mantel, blows it out. only the firelight strikes his face as he stares broodingly at the closed bedroom door.}

<A>__{captain, the reverend sam clayton, a big man with frosty blue eyes, graying hair, a bristly full mustache and the air of grave and resolute authority. he is a minister of the gospel with a .44 on his hip. lars jorgensen, the edwards' neighbor, is a harried little man, scandinavian. as we shall find out soon, he has a brisk and buxom wife and a rather astonishing brood of children. brad jorgensen is one of these: sandy haired, brash, amiable, impulsive. he is in his early twenties. charlie maccorry, slightly older than brad, is sergeant of company a of the rangers. (he is also company a.) charlie is a taciturn, gently spoken, competent man, clearly patterned by his association with captain, the rev. sam. mose harper is an old scout a walking bone rack, yet capable of tireless feats of endurance. some think him "tetched" yet he has managed to endure to his age during a time and in a region where few men lived to see their grandchildren. he wears a ragged dark overcoat in all weather, a narrow brimmed hat with a feather in its band. ed nesby is a rancher and homesteader in his mid thirties; resolute, honest, self effacing; nothing picturesque or dramatic about him; just a solid citizen and a realist.}
