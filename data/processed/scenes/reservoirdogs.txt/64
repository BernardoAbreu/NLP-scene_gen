<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(looking through the case)}
<D>__{you know, all things considered, this was pretty successful.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{i don't believe you just said that.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{no, it was messy as hell, but do you realize how much you got away with? there's over two million dollars worth of diamonds here.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{i love this guy.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{hey, what's done is done. we can all sit around and have a big cry about it or we can deal with the situation at hand.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{the situation as hand isn't that fuckin satchel. you and joe have a responsibility to your men.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{hey, it's the best i could do.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{the man is fucking dying.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{and i'm telling you, bonnie'll take care of him.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{he needs a doctor, not a fuckin nurse.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{ask me how many doctors i called. you wanna embarrass yourself, ask me how many doctors i called.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{obviously not enough.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{fuck you! you gotta little black book, then whip is out. if not, listen how it is. i called three doctors and couldn't get through to shit. now, time being a factor, i called bonnie. sweet broad, helluva broad, and a registered nurse. told her a bullshit story, upside: she said bring him to her apartment.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{if he dies i'm holding you personally responsible.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{fuck you buddy boy! okay, you wanna play that way. i am personally leaving myself vulnerable with this bonnie situation. i don't think she'll call the cops, but i don't know for sure. but me being too nice a fuckin guy was willin to risk it. but no fuckin more.}
<P>__{(he grabs his portable phone)}
<D>__{i'm callin bonnie back and tellin her to forget it. you take care of your friend, you know so much about it.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{goddamnit, will you guys grow up!}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i don't need to grow up, my friend. i am a grown up. i'm being responsible, i'm taking care of business.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{cut the shit! i don't think you called anybody except some cooze you once fucked, who happens to wear orthopedic shoes. and i don't think that's good enough care for a gut shot man.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{yeah, well i don't give a flying fuck what you think!}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<P>__{(to mr. white)}
<D>__{look, he's not sayin this bitch is gonna operate on him. she's gonna give him better attention than we can until we can get a doctor. nobody's forgotten about doctors. joe'll get one in a snap. this is something we're doing in the meantime. i think both of you are actin like a couple of assholes.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{yeah, right. i arrange a nurse, i leave myself wide open, and i'm an asshole.}
