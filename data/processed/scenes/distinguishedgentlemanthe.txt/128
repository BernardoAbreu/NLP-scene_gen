<L>__{exterior grant's statue night}
<A>__{a man waits, alone, in the shadow of a large statue. it's homer. in a jacket and tie, his stubble shaved off, he looks like a plausible government worker. tommy and reinhardt approach.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{mr. yancey?}
<C>__{homer}
<P>__{(cold)}
<D>__{i thought you'd be alone.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{he's my aa. he goes where i go. if you can trust me, you can trust him.}
<A>__{homer eyes reinhardt a moment, then continues.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{congressman, i have information i think you may want. it's about something going on at the epa.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{what have you got?}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{i got a wife and three kids, and a note on my house, that's what i got.}
<C>__{tommy}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{nothin' comes for nothin' in this town, do it?}
<P>__{(to reinhardt)}
<D>__{you got any cash on you? i'm kind of light.}
<C>__{reinhardt}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{you can't do that!}
<C>__{tommy}
<P>__{(to homer)}
<D>__{this stuff's pretty good?}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{in the right hands, it could mean a great deal.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{okay. sunday. fifth race at del mar. blueboy is running twenty to one. i'd take a major position.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{you have to be shitting me.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{no, not at all my cousin henry spends his days pumping water into horses' stomachs and stuffing percodan up their butts. trust me.}
<A>__{reinhardt is interested in this. and he admires tommy's m.o.}
<C>__{homer}
<P>__{(after a moment)}
<D>__{alright. the white house is putting heat on the epa. they want us to announce a major investigation of the relation between power lines and cancer clusters.}
<C>__{reinhardt}
<D>__{but didn't the epa already do a study?}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{yeah, but when the draft got to the white house, they didn't like it. so they brought their own scientists in to kill it.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{why did the white house change its mind?}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{who knows?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{is there new evidence?}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{yeah their polls have dropped like a rock. they need an issue. this one makes them look good on the environment, and they don't have to spend a penny.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{and what good is this to me?}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{come on, congressman, in this town, information is currency. and advance information is gold.}
<A>__{reinhardt nods in agreement.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{but you've got to move fast. once the white house goes public with this, they can't turn back. if your friends at the power company want to kill this investigation, they'd better do it now. evening, gentlemen.}
<A>__{after homer leaves:}
<C>__{reinhardt}
<D>__{blueboy. twenty to one. is your cousin henry always right?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{i ain't got no cousin henry.}
