<A>__{the headlight on the gueuse illuminates only a few feet around jacques, as if he were standing in a circle of light. he stays there, patiently floating around and around his cable... as if he were waiting for something. a long form circles the border between the darkness and the light. jacques holds out his hand. a dolphin comes and presses its body against it. two other dolphins come out of the night. jacques watches in amazement. a dolphin lays his muzzle in jacques' hand, ready to lead him off. jacques hesitates. jacques lets go of the cable and lets himself be led away. their silhouettes disappear in the deep blue night.}
