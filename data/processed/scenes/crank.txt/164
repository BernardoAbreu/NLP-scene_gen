<A>__{the camera follows chev through the room, along the humming rows of sewing machines. he crosses from one side of the room to another, where a single open window leading out to the fire escape streams sunlight. a supervisor, korean, skinny, mid thirties, stringy mustache, is dozed off in a chair by the window. chev walks right by, out the window and onto the fire escape. the camera stays with him.}
