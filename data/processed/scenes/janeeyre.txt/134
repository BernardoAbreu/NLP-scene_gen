<L>__{interior night. moor house jane's bedroom.}
<A>__{jane closes the door. she puts her hand across her lips. the icy kiss has agonised her with the full force of her loneliness. she curls up in a ball, desperate.}
<L>__{exterior evening. moor house the garden.}
<A>__{a glorious summer sunset. jane is digging at a flower bed, putting all her passion into the task. she is flushed with exertion. st john watches.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{you are wasted here.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{am i not being useful?}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{you should look beyond moor house, beyond the selfish calm and comfort of affluence.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{beyond to what?}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{i go to india in six weeks.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{so soon? }
<A>__{st john draws jane away from her work.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{i can see what your gifts are and why they were given. come with me.}
<A>__{jane is utterly crestfallen.}
<C>__{st john }
<D>__{god and nature intended you for a missionary's wife. you are formed for labour not for love. i want to claim you not for my pleasure but for god's service.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i'm not fit for it. i have no vocation.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{you're far too humble.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{st john have mercy. i feel my mind shrinking }
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{don't be afraid. you are diligent, faithful, docile, courageous, gentle and heroic. cease to mistrust yourself. i trust you unreservedly. let me give you time to think. but know this; in you, i recognise a fellow soul, a soul that would revel in the flame and excitement of sacrifice.}
<A>__{jane is chilled to the bone by his words. st john leaves the garden and walks away over the moors.}
