<A>__{rachel silently waggles her fingers. kym glances back at her magazine to discover one of the stylists standing close by, gazing at her face. kym does a little double take.}
<C>__{stylist}
<D>__{you don't remember me, do you?}

<C>__{stylist}
<D>__{i got yours.}
<A>__{kym gives him a quizzical look.}
<C>__{stylist}
<D>__{you drew poodles in the margins. i know it's supposed to be anonymous and everything, but you were so brave. the way your uncle abused you and your sister, and how it led to your sister's anorexia, and how you stayed up nights when she was down to fifty pounds holding a mirror to her face to make sure she was breathing. i will never forget reading that, i swear to god.}
<A>__{rachel's stylist is removing her foils while rachel chokes on her diet pepsi and it comes out her nose. kym looks nervous.}

<C>__{stylist}
<P>__{(to kym)}
<D>__{i found it so profoundly inspirational that you could be there for her during your own incredible ordeal. i thank god that you came in here today. i never thought i'd ever have the chance to thank you. it was your strength that gave me the courage to confront my own abuse and help me turn my life around.}
<A>__{rachel slams down her magazine and leaves the salon. kym runs after her. both girls have foils in their hair.}
