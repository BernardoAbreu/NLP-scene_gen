<L>__{interior rwhs trevor's classroom continuous action}
<A>__{walls are covered with assorted science posters. styrofoam nuclei dangle from the ceiling. trevor unstraps the fat briefcase from his bicycle and sets it on a metal stool next to his desk...}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(enthusiastically)}
<D>__{let's get started. august and tywan, you pass out the books. thank you, gentlemen.}
<A>__{auggie and tywan don't budge.}
<C>__{tywan}
<D>__{whas up wit' your car, g? yer pinto blow up?}
<A>__{the majority of students aren't even paying attention. a group in the back is already starting a card game.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(good natured smile)}
<D>__{no, i don't own a pinto, tywan.}
<P>__{(addressing the class)}
<D>__{okay, can i have everyone's attention?}
<A>__{no response, but it doesn't phase trevor. he removes the front wheels from his bike.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{the purpose of the bicycle is to demonstrate the principle of centripetal force. that's the opposite of the force we studied yesterday, which was...}
<C>__{voice in the crowd}
<D>__{magnum force.}
<A>__{hoots and laughter.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{centrifugal force... centripetal force is where the acceleration of a body moving in circular motion is directed toward its center by an opposing force, thus creating momentum that constrains the body to its circular path. like a gyroscope.}
<P>__{(sees nothing but yawns)}
<D>__{it's better if i show you. here, tywan, you be my helper.}
<A>__{tywan and auggie are busy talking in the corner. they still haven't passed out the books.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{tywan? come on.}
<A>__{tywan, solidly built like a rodin bronze, saunters over.}
<C>__{tywan}
<D>__{whad up, g?}
<P>__{(to rest of class)}
<D>__{hey, shut up! y'all too damn loud, man!}
<A>__{class quiets but only marginally.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{i need you to demonstrate centripetal force.}
<P>__{(removes briefcase from stool)}
<D>__{here, have a seat.}
<A>__{tywan sits and trevor hands him the upside down bicycle.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{okay, hold the bike steady with your knees. that's it. seat positioned against your chest.}
<A>__{tywan glances over at auggie and starts to laugh.}
<C>__{tywan}
<P>__{(to auggie)}
<D>__{shut up, foo.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{okay, now crank the pedals and get that back wheel spinning about 180 r.p.m.}
<C>__{tywan}
<D>__{whas up wit' dat?}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(coaxing him along)}
<D>__{you'll see. be patient.}
<A>__{a skeptical tywan starts to crank the pedals, but he's not pedaling hard enough.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{... put some muscle into it.}
<A>__{tywan cranks the pedals harder now. trevor back pedals over to the textbook shelf and randomly selects a physical science book (but doesn't open it).}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{... keep pedaling. harder.}
<A>__{a paper airplane sails past an oblivious tywan. he cranks harder and harder until he's sweating ham juice. now, he impales trevor with a befuddled squinterior}
<C>__{tywan}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{whas up? i tol' you you was crazy, man.}
<A>__{a thin smile of confidence from trevor now...}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{now tilt the wheel to your right.}
<A>__{tywan does and immediately the wheel pulls him to the right, causing the stool to slowly spin on its axis.}
<C>__{tywan}
<P>__{(eyes wide like a little kid)}
<D>__{aw, damn. i'm spinnin'. lookit me, auggie!}
<A>__{trevor flickers a smile as tywan's spinning starts to draw the attention of the rest of the class. now trevor refers to the physical science book in his hand. smile on his face immediately fades. insert: physical science textbook. in magic marker. the large number 187 has been scrawled across every page. trevor flips through the book. he checks the front page to see who it belongs to. juxtaposed to trevor's distracted state, the class is now focused on tywan's achievement...}
