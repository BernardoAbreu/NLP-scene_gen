<L>__{exterior carson's house night}
<A>__{carson comes around to the driveway, which is illuminated by the streetlight where two 20 ish assholes are sitting in his 1965 mustang convertible, their presence courtesy of a huge cut they've made in the otherwise perfect ragtop. car theft tools in a leather case between them, they're prying the ignition switch out of the dashboard. asshole #1 spots carson. he gets out of the car, wielding a crowbar. his partner keeps working.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{asshole #1 lunges viciously, swiping at carson with the crowbar, taking a piece out of his side. carson starts bleeding profusely, but he's too pissed to notice. carson uses his bat to take the offensive. they go at each other like combatants in a swordfight, the clanking of metal echoing through the neighborhood along with the screaming house and car alarms, and frantic neighborhood dogs. surprised at carson's fury and strength, asshole #1 backs onto the lawn, oblivious to the running sprinklers. as he backs away, his shoe catches on one of the sprinkler heads. it breaks off, and a huge geyser of water sprays out. carson holds his bat in both hands and jams the front of it into asshole #1's breadbasket. he doubles over. carson grabs asshole #1's arm, and pulls it quickly against his raised knee. there is a snap and a loud howl as the arm breaks, and carson tosses him aside. seeing this, asshole #2 gives up on the car. he takes off toward the street. carson runs to head him off, but he's a lot faster in his air jordans than carson is in his bare feet.}
<B>__{wider}
<A>__{carson grabs the metal lid from a garbage can at the curb and flings it like a huge frisbee. it sails across the street and nails asshole #2's head. he kisses the pavement, stunned. carson runs up and grabs him, but he pulls out a long, sharp screwdriver and jabs at carson with it. then, blue flashing lights appear from around the corner: a westec chevy blazer. two uniformed guards get out, and fumble with their sidearms.}
<C>__{westec guard}
<D>__{everybody... chill! bikini boy! on the ground!}
<A>__{asshole #2 is still trying to gouge carson with the screwdriver. carson glares at the dopey guards.}
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{asshole was trying to boost my car!}
<B>__{angle across street}
<A>__{carson's fiftyish, black, next door neighbor, wearing pajamas and a robe, comes out of his house. carson sees him.}
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{mike call 911!}
<C>__{neighbor}
<D>__{been trying...}
<P>__{(has a cordless phone)}
<D>__{it's busy.}
<P>__{(to guards; re carson)}
<D>__{he's the good guy, you schumcks.}
<A>__{the guards seem to get it. without warning, one takes out a taser and zaps asshole #2. carson lets go just in time.}
<B>__{closer}
<A>__{holding his bleeding side, carson walks back to his house. he notices the "neighborhood watch" sign has graffiti spray painted on it. he touches it the paint is still wet. his neighbor shrugs whatta ya gonna do? the paper guy drives by... and tosses carson's newspaper right under the gushing sprinkler.}
