<A>__{darkness. the soft sound of moving water can be heard in the background. from the top of the screen a tiny, floating light moves its way downwards across the screen. as it passes, we see just under the water part of a young mans face. his eyes are closed. the light disappears, and across the darkness appears the title s a w. the title fades away. the tiny light appears again, this time floating down at the end of a tub of water, just near someones bare foot. the camera cuts again to the face of the young man underwater. this is adam. suddenly, his eyes fly open and he comes to life, opening his mouth and gasping for air. as he wakes up and struggles within the bathtub, we see his foot catch on a drain plug, unplugging it. the water starts to drain, and we see go with the water the tiny light, which we can also see has some kind of key attached to it. the room itself is pitch black, but we can still just barely make him out in the dark. adam lifts himself out of the tub and falls onto the floor, coughing and gasping from the shock. he manages to get to his feet, but as he moves forward he realizes that his ankle is chained to something. he feels his way over to a pipe in the corner, reaching down and pulling at his chain that is attached to it. he cries out, his voice frantic, frightened, and a bit hysterical.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{help! someone help me! (he stops when he hears a loud dragging sound somewhere in the room. he looks out into the darkness and calls out.) is someone there? hey!}
<P>__{(he turns back to the corner to which}
<D>__{he is chained, says in a slightly softer but still panicked voice) shit, im probably dead.}
<A>__{suddenly, from out within the darkness comes a mans low, raspy voice. it startles adam. the voice, we will soon learn, belongs to lawrence.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{youre not dead.}
<A>__{adam quickly turns in the direction of the voice. holding his arms out for balance, he tries to look across the room to whoever is speaking, but still cannot see a thing.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{whos that? whos that?!}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(his voice strangely a bit on the calm}
<D>__{side, and almost irritated with adams reaction to the situation. this shall}
<P>__{be his tone for many scenes to come.)}
<D>__{theres no point in yelling, i already tried it.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{turn on the lights!}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{would if i could.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{what the fuck is going on? where am i? (he turns into his corner, touching}
<P>__{the wall.)}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{i dont know yet.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(smelling something; in disgust) what}
<D>__{is that smell?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{shh! hang on a second, i think i found something.}
<A>__{with a loud click and an even louder buzzing sound, the very bright fluorescent lights come to life, lighting up in rows, starting from lawrences end and moving towards adam. as they come on, adam is nearly blinded by the sudden change from pitch black to bright white and squints in pain, holding up his arms to cover his face. in the light we now see that he is in his mid twenties, with short brown hair, wearing a dark blue striped shirt over a white tee shirt and jeans, looking like a drowned rat from the tub. it takes him a moment but his eyes finally start to adjust, and he looks around the room. he and we see lawrence, who also winces from the glare of the lights, standing by the light switch and the door. he is on the opposite end of the room, also chained to a pipe in the corner by his foot. he wears a blue button down dress shirt, now soaked with sweat stains. he is middle aged, mid to late forties, with pale blonde hair and even paler skin. dark circles are under his eyes. both men are barefoot. lawrences eyes adjust to the light and he sees across the room. then, his gaze starts towards the center of the room, as does adams, who steps forward as much as he can, a look of horror on his face. we see lying face down the body of a man who has blown his brains out, lying in a pool of blood, clad in only boxer shorts and a tee shirt. in his left hand is a gun, in his right hand is a micro cassette recorder. a gunshot and a scream are heard as the camera moves up and in a fast 360 angle above and circling the man, ending in a full overhead view of him. the shot cuts to adam, who reels in shock and disgust.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{holy shit!}
<A>__{he turns towards the tub and leans over, gagging and coughing. lawrence in the meantime hops forward the best he can, studying the body with a look of fear and concern. adam stops coughing and turns back around, takes another look at the body and around the room. he looks down at his chain then starts to completely freak out, grabbing and pulling at his chain.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(screaming) help!!! (he falls back onto}
<D>__{his bottom on the floor as he yanks at the chain as hard as he can.) help!!! help!}
<A>__{lawrence just stands and watches him with an almost embarrassed, appalled look at his behaviour. it seems that lawrence, despite being in the situation hes in, is above that kind of uncontrolled reaction. he speaks a bit coldly.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{no one can hear you.}
<A>__{adam stops pulling at the chain, stands up and looks to lawrence, his breathing fast and heavy. his voice is not yelling anymore but still just as hysterical.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{what the fuck is this?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{calm down, just calm down. (he knows that to remain calm is to remain in control, something he must be no matter what the situation.) are you hurt?}
<A>__{adam looks down at himself, shrugging slightly.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i dont know...yeah!}
<A>__{lawrence moves over to the pipe in the corner, leaning against it for support.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(calmly) whats your name?}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(sarcastic) my name is very fucking}
<D>__{confused! (demanding) whats your name? whats going on here?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(internal eye roll; hes getting more and more aggravated with adams behaviour)}
<D>__{my name is lawrence gordon, im a doctor. i just woke up here, just like you.}
<P>__{(he reaches up, wipes his face with his sleeve)}
<A>__{adam kneels back down facing the pipe, pulling at his chains once more, but not with his prior panic. he winces at the metal biting into his skin.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(in pain) ah!}
<A>__{lawrence looks at adam with a look that seems to say im stuck in here with this guy? he then glances down at the body.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{recognize him?}
<A>__{adam continues to pull at his chains, does not and will not look at the body, just shakes his head.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(sharply) no.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(trying to get something out of this}
<D>__{kid) well, do you have any idea how you got here?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{whats the last thing you remember?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{nothing. (he sits back onto the floor,}
<P>__{stops pulling at his chains for a moment.)}
<D>__{i went to bed in my shithole apartment, and woke up in an actual shithole. (he raises his left leg slightly, starts trying to pull his foot out of the iron cuff. he glances to lawrence, who has moved over to the wall to his left, bent over slightly and resting a hand against a pipe.) so what about you, huh?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(he shrugs slightly, shaking his head.)}
<D>__{well theres...theres not much to tell, really. (across the room, adam gives up with the chain for the time being but remains sitting on the floor.) i was on my way home from work and uh, i dont remember anything else.}
<A>__{adam just sits there, glancing over to the body and then focusing on it much more. the initial panic has worn off for now, replaced simply with fear and shock. his voice is a bit softer.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{first dead body ive ever seen. look different in real life. they dont move.}
<A>__{lawrence slowly lowers himself into a sitting position against the wall. he pokes slightly at the iron cuff around his foot.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{from the looks of these chains, someone didnt want us to go very far either.}
<A>__{suddenly, adam leaps up, lifting up his shirt and exposing his abdomen. his panic is back, but not at full force like before. he studies himself then glances to lawrence.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{can you see any scars?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(looking at him strangely) what?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{huh? this is what they do man, (he gestures to his stomach, where there are in fact no scars.) they kidnap you and drug you and before you know it, youre in a bathtub and your kidneys are on ebay.}
<P>__{(a ridiculous theory to us and to lawrence, but adam states it with conviction.)}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(a scoffing tone in his voice) no one}
<D>__{has taken your kidneys.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(disbelief) how can you tell from way}
<D>__{over there?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(matter of fact) because youd either}
<D>__{be in terrible agony, or youd be dead by now. trust me.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{what are you, a surgeon? (he lowers his shirt and turns and bends down to}
<P>__{prod at the chain around the pipe again.)}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{yeah. (he sighs. hes getting tired}
<P>__{of adam already. he speaks sharply.)}
<D>__{so, you gonna tell me your name, or what?}
<A>__{adam stands back up, turns to lawrence, his voice once again calm.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{adam.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(getting to his feet, his voice a bit}
<D>__{calmer) well adam, what we need to do}
<P>__{(he leans with one hand outstretched}
<D>__{against the pipe to his right. adam watches him, scared but calm) is start thinking about why were here. whoever brought us there couldve killed us by now. but they didnt. they must want something from us. (he looks up and around the room) question is what. (he sees something up on the wall, moves forwards a bit towards it. we see that it is a brand new clock on the wall, ticking away. it reads currently at 10:22.) that clock.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{what about it?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{its brand new. (squints, studying it)}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(not getting what hes implying) so?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(sighs; its quite simple, why cant}
<D>__{adam see it?) so, someone obviously wanted us to know the time. (adam looks a bit confused still, mulls over that}
<P>__{information. lawrence thinks for a moment.)}
<D>__{wait, i think i may be able to reach that door.}
<A>__{lawrence moves over as far as the chain will allow him to the giant, wooden sliding door, pushing against it as hard as he can. in the meantime, we see adam thinking. he pauses, then reaches down and starts going through his pockets. there is nothing in the front two, but in his back left pocket he pulls out a plastic baggie with a white envelope in it. he unfolds the baggie; the envelope says adam. he stares at it in his hands, wondering what it is. lawrence continues struggling with the door, quickly glances over his shoulder to see what adam is doing. he sees adam holding the baggie. adam reaches into the envelope, pulls out a micro cassette tape. a close up shows the words play me written on the tape label. adam holds it in his hand, studying it. lawrence turns away from the door, looking over and trying to see what adam has in his hand.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{what is that? (adam doesnt answer, continues looking at the tape. lawrences voice grows impatient.) excuse me.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(glances up briefly at lawrence, then}
<D>__{back down at the tape. his voice sounds slightly surprised.) its a tape.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{where did you find it?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{it was in my pocket.}
<A>__{lawrence thinks about that briefly then starts digging through his own pockets, finds within them a white envelope with lawrence written across it in the same black lettering as adams.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(regarding his tape) it says play me.}
<A>__{lawrence tears into his envelope, empties the contents into the palm of his hand. first, he holds up a similar tape to adams. it also says play me. then he holds up a single bullet, studying it, not sure what its there for yet. then, he holds up a tiny key. he bends over, gets down on the floor and starts to try to unlock his chains with the key. it doesnt seem to be working.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(frustrated, mumbling to himself and}
<D>__{to the key) come on, come on, come on....}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(seeing that it doesnt seem to be working}
<D>__{on lawrences lock) throw it over here.}
<A>__{lawrence gives him a slightly mistrustful look, but then holds up the key and throws it. adam misses the key at first as it hits the floor in front of the dirty toilet near his corner.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{fuck. (he leans over and picks up the key, then bends down and tries the key on the lock on his ankle, which doesnt work. he tries the lock on the chains around the pipe. it isnt working there}
<P>__{either.)}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(watching him) no?}
<A>__{adam gives up, drops the key onto the floor frustratedly, shaking his head. thats when he looks over to the body again, and the shot closes up on the hand holding the tape recorder. a small loop handle juts out of the hands grip. adam stands up, then bends down and picks up the tape on the floor, looking at it. he puts it back down then stretches himself flat out on the floor, trying to reach. unfortunately, there is still a good three to four feet between him and the body.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{use your shirt.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(gets back up to his knees) what?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{your shirt.}
<A>__{adam looks down at himself, then takes off the long sleeved blue shirt. he lays back down, holding the shirt by the ends of each sleeve, and throws it, trying to catch it on the tape recorder. it misses. he tries a second time; same result.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{come on...}
<A>__{adam tries again; it misses. it is just barely reaching. he pulls the shirt back, gets back up on his knees, aggravated.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{it wont work.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(trying to get him to not give up yet)}
<D>__{well, look around, there must be something else you can use.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(stands, ready to give up, skeptical)}
<D>__{theres nothing.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(insistent) well there must be something!}
<A>__{adam looks around his area, then into the bathtub. he sees something, bends over, takes out the tub plug, which is attached to a long cord. he ties the cord around the sleeve of his shirt. he kneels down, holding out the shirt, aiming.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{come on, you can do it.}
<A>__{adam throws it, attempting to get the plug through the loop at the end of the tape recorder. he misses.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{come on, come on, again.}
<A>__{he tries again and misses. on the third try, however, he gets the plug right through the loop. lawrence smiles in relief. adam very slowly pulls it back, dragging the tape recorder along the floor towards him. he picks it up, getting rid of the plug and dropping it and the shirt on the floor. he picks up the tape, pops it in and presses play, holding the tape recorder out a bit so that they can both hear, but keeping his head tilted so he can hear better. a chilling deep, raspy, sinister male voice the jigsaw killer comes from the tape. as it speaks, adams expression is fearful, but the thought how does he know? can be detected.}
<C>__{jigsaw}
<P>__{(on tape) rise and shine, adam. youre}
<D>__{probably wondering where you are. ill tell you where you might be. you might be in the room that you die in. up until now, you simply sat in the shadows, watching others live out their lives. but what do voyeurs see when they look into the mirror? now, i see you as a strange mix of someone angry and yet apathetic. but mostly just pathetic. so are you going to watch yourself die today, adam? or do something about it?}
<P>__{(end)}
<A>__{adam looks frightened but not sure of the entire meaning of the message.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i dont get it. (he presses the stop}
<P>__{button on the tape.)}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(eagerly, gestures.) throw me the player.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(pauses, thinks) no, you throw me your}
<D>__{tape.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(a heavy sigh. he looks at adam as a}
<D>__{slow minded fool who simply doesnt understand the full capacity of the situation that theyre in, and speaks to him as such.) look, were going to have to work together if we want to get out of here. now just throw it to me.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(picks up on the tone, speaks defensively)}
<D>__{im not going to risk breaking it! you throw me your tape!}
<A>__{lawrence pauses, looking at adam as though hed like to smack him, then holds up and tosses the tape. it hits the floor behind adam, who kneels down and picks it up, pops it in, presses play. its the same chilling voice as on adams tape. as the tape plays, adam stares at lawrence, and lawrence at the tape recorder.}
<C>__{jigsaw}
<P>__{(on tape) dr. gordon, this is your wake}
<D>__{up call. every day of your working life, you have given people the news that they are going to die soon. now you will be the cause of death. your aim in this game is to kill adam. (adam glances down at the tape recorder wide eyed, then back up at lawrence) you have until six on the clock to do it. there sa man in the room with you. when theres that much poison in your blood (another view of the body from lawrences pov), the only thing left to do is shoot yourself.}
<P>__{(jigsaw coughs) there are ways to win}
<D>__{this hidden all around you. just remember: x marks the spot for the treasure. if you do not kill adam by 6:00, then alison and diana will die, dr. gordon. and ill leave you in this room to rot.}
<P>__{let the game begin. (end)}
<A>__{the looks on each mans face clearly say oh shit. the tape ends. lawrence stands up.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(firmly) give me that. now. (adam tosses}
<D>__{him the tape. he catches it, rewinds, plays back. adam stands up from his}
<P>__{spot on the floor.)}
<C>__{jigsaw}
<P>__{(on tape)...then alison and diana will}
<D>__{die, dr. gordon. and ill leave you in this room to rot.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(thinking, trying to figure this out)}
<D>__{any idea who that is?}
<C>__{jigsaw}
<P>__{(on tape) let the game begin.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{he knows us.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{wait a minute. (rewinds more)}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(false hope) what do you think? probably}
<D>__{a joke, right?}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{shh, shh! (presses play)}
<C>__{jigsaw}
<P>__{(on tape) let the game begin.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(softly) listen...}
<C>__{jigsaw}
<P>__{(on tape, in a very hushed tone after}
<D>__{a brief silence)...follow your heart.}
<A>__{lawrence stops the tape.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{what the hell does follow your heart mean?}
<A>__{lawrence is looking around, on the walls and everywhere else in the bathroom for a heart. he spots a small one drawn in brown on the toilet next to adam and points.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{there! right next to you, on the toilet.}
<A>__{adam looks, sees the toilet. slowly, he bends down, resting his hands on the seat, looking down into the bowl of liquid shit, not really sure what hes looking for.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(impatient, gesturing) come on, come}
<D>__{on.}
<A>__{adam glances up at lawrence with a look of youve got to be kidding me, but lawrence watches him expectantly. adam sighs, then reaches in with his right hand, fishing around in the mess.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{oh man...(he gasps, making gagging sounds, his face turned away from the bowl. he coughs, fishes around for another brief moment, then quickly pulls back, trying to shake some of the shit off of his hand, spitting.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(expectantly) anything?}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(disgusted) no solids.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{take off the lid. (he points to the lid. adam looks to it, slowly stands up, reaches for it. lawrence has no patience.) come on!}
<A>__{adam takes off the lid, places it down on the toilet seat. the water is clearer inside, and he reaches in and pulls out something wrapped up in a black garbage bag. he holds it up for lawrence to see, turns to him.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i really wish i had checked in there first.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{huh. (he smiles slightly) what is it?}
<A>__{adam tears into the bag, reaches in and pulls out two hacksaws. he drops the bag on the floor, bends down and takes up his chain, holding one of the hacksaws and beginning to saw at the chain with it. lawrence watches him for a moment.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{hey! (adam turns and looks. lawrence speaks in an irritated voice) mind passing me the other one?}
<A>__{adam reaches over and picks up the other hacksaw, then carefully throws it across the room. it hits the pipe to lawrences left. lawrence reaches down and picks it up, then sits down on the floor. quick shot back to adam, who, while lawrence is preoccupied with picking up the hacksaw, quickly picks up the garbage bag and tosses it into the bathtub. both men start to saw away at their chains furiously, but neither are making any progress. suddenly, adams saw snaps in the middle, and his temper flares.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(enraged) fuck! fuck! (he reacts violently,}
<D>__{hitting the broken saw twice against the iron pipe then turns and hums it across the room, right into a mirror. a small piece of the mirror breaks off}
<P>__{and flies to the floor.)}
<A>__{lawrence glances over at what adam has done, then goes back to sawing for another moment. adam sits back down, breathing heavily, leaning against the pipe in his corner. finally, lawrence gives up, turning and sitting with his back against the pipe, also breathing heavily for a moment. he sits there, when a look of realization comes across his face. he holds up the saw, looking at it, understanding. he lowers it to the floor, shaking his head slightly.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(everything is becoming more clear now)}
<D>__{he doesnt want us to cut through our chains. he wants us to cut through our feet. (adam looks up at him, eyebrows raised.) i think i may know whos done this to us.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{what did you say? (he stands up; is}
<P>__{lawrence hiding something from him?)}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{its not someone i know personally. its...just someone i know of.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(getting slightly frantic again) jesus}
<D>__{christ! tell me, who is it?!}
<A>__{the camera closes up on lawrences face. to the right of it, the screen is fading into a flashback of a crime scene. as lawrence speaks, his face fades and the flashback scene grows clearer, until it is only the crime scene, with three detectives walking down a flight of stairs.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{the last i heard...the police still hadnt caught him.}
<A>__{we now see the three figures descending through a trap door down a flight of stairs. the lighting is a bright lime green that is strangely dark at the same time. the trio enters a small, cell like room with a low ceiling. they are tapp, sing, and kerry. tapp is a tall black man in his late forties early fifties. sing is an asian man in his mid to late thirties, and kerry is a caucasian woman in her mid to late thirties with long, curly brown hair that is tied back in a ponytail. all are well dressed, sing and tapp in suits, the woman in a jacket and dress slacks. they are the detectives working on this case. as they move into the room, sing sees something that brings a look of shock to his face, shining a flashlight on it. we cannot see it yet.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(vo) and the only reason i know that}
<D>__{is because i was a suspect.}
<A>__{tapp comes into the room last, ducking slightly from his height, and comes up alongside sing, looking at the same thing.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(vo) ill start from the beginning.}
<C>__{kerry}
<D>__{this ones not fresh anymore. at least three weeks out. (detective tapp squints}
<P>__{as he peers in and studies the body)}
<D>__{victims a 46 year old male. (quick flash of a crime scene photo, a closeup of behind the mans head and upper back. there are deep cuts all over. the camera cuts upwards to the detectives.) died of massive blood loss. mostly through the femoral artery. (the camera pans around to detective tapp, who moves around the side fo the cage to get a better look inside, shining his flashlight in.) he started at the back of the cage and tunneled his way through the razor wire so fast its amazing he got as far as he did. cut himself so deep, we found traces of stomach acid on the floor. (another more gruesome crime scene photo shot of the body from the side; we can see the razor wire digging in under his arm. also, a close up shot}
<P>__{of some of his wounds; long, deep cuts.)}
<D>__{we also found this. (she holds up an evidence baggie with a micro cassette tape recorder, just like the one adam and lawrence found in their cell. she presses the play button, and tapp and sing listen. its the same chilling}
<P>__{voice from adam and lawrences tapes.)}
<C>__{jigsaw}
<P>__{(on tape) hello paul. you are a perfectly}
<D>__{healthy, sane, middle class male. yet last month, you ran a straight razor across your wrists. did you cut yourself because you truly wanted to die, or did you just want some attention? tonight, youll show me. the irony is that if you want to die, you just have to stay where you are. but if you want to live, youll have to cut yourself again. (flashback shot of paul waking up in the cage, looking around, scared and confused. the shots go back and forth between the detectives and the paul flashback, with him grabbing and shaking the razor wire, screaming. his screams sound distant under jigsaws voice.) find the path through the razor wire to the door. but hurry. at 3:00 that door will lock and then this room becomes your tomb. how much blood will you shed to stay}
<P>__{alive, paul? (end)}
<C>__{kerry}
<P>__{(stopping the tape) the door was on}
<D>__{a timer. it was unlocked until 3:00. then it slammed shut. he was given two hours.}
<A>__{cut back to detective tapp, who notices something and shines his light on it. we see a strange wound on pauls body, a piece of flesh carved out into the shape of a jigsaw piece.}
<C>__{tapp}
<D>__{jigsaw piece. (sing looks in as well, see it. there is a quick flash of crime scene photos showing a close up of the wound. tapp sighs.) i think were gonna be here for a while, sing. (sing looks to him. we get another quick crime scene}

<C>__{lawrence}
<P>__{(vo) the newspapers started calling}
<D>__{him the jigsaw killer.}
<A>__{cut back to lawrence in the bathroom. for his next two spoken lines, the shot switches back and forth between him and the detectives in the razor wire room.}
<C>__{lawrence}
<D>__{actually, technically speaking, hes not really a murderer. he never killed anyone.}
<A>__{sing, wearing gloves, gets in the cage and examines pauls body a bit. a flash of another crime scene photo of the wound with a ruler held up to it is shown. more gruesome crime scene photos of that and other wounds are flashed across the screen.}

<P>__{(vo, on tape) hello mark. if youre}
<D>__{so sick, then why do i have so many photos of you up and about? (there is a quick montage of a camera snapping several black and white shots of mark up and about, looking around and getting into a car.) lets put your so called illness to the test. (flashback image of mark waking up. he is a younger man in his mid to late twenties, with dark brown hair. he is completely nude, smeared in some kind of vaseline like ointment. in front of him is a small, square glass plate held up by some chains. on the plate is a micro cassette player, a lit votive candle, and a box of matches. he gets up, looking around confusedly and scared.) right now, there is a slow acting poison in your veins. the antidote is in the safe. (black and white crime scene shot of the safe, then a shot of mark standing over it, screaming, his screams distant under jigsaws voice, as with paul.) the combination to the safe (quick montage of several black and white crime scene photos of numbers written all over the walls) is written on the wall. hurry up and program it in. but watch your step (marks bare foot steps on the broken glass scattered all across the floor). and by the way, thats a flammable substance smeared on your body (shot of mark looking at the ointment on his hand, up his arm, everywhere), so i would be careful with that candle, if i were you...}

<P>__{(huddled over the safe; screams, but}
<D>__{it is still distant sounding) help!!!!!}
<C>__{jigsaw}
<P>__{(vo ctd)....or all the people youve}
<D>__{burned with your act (mark starts to turn the lock on the safe) just might have their revenge.}
<A>__{we see mark desperately going around the room, holding the candle, looking at the walls, trying to find a combination. the camera goes back and forth a few times in a sped up shot to him doing this and turning a the lock on the safe, trying to program the combination into the safe. he moves in a circle, clockwise to us. when he gets to facing right in front of us, the flame from the candle flares up and engulfs the shot, flaring into a close up crime scene photo of marks charred face. the shot moves back to the trio of detectives, with sing holding the tape recorder.}

<D>__{i found something else. well, two things, actually. (she moves past them and we go with her over to a wall where there is a small hole cut, about an inch or two in diameter. the light from the outside shines in.) there was someone standing outside here watching through this peephole. looks like our friend jigsaw likes to book himself front row seats to his own sick little games. he was there at the last one as well.}
<P>__{(she walks over to sing and tapp) only}
<D>__{this time, he left us his penlight.}
<P>__{(she holds up the penlight in an evidence}
