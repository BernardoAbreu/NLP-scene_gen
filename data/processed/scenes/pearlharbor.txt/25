<L>__{exterior bassingborne airfield britain dusk}
<A>__{in the eternal dusk of england, everything is cold and gray. british fighter planes spitfires and hurricanes are surrounded by mechanics hurriedly ripping off bullet riddled fuselage panels and digging into overworked aircraft engines. rafe walks across the tarmac, still carrying his duffel bag. he moves up behind a slim, pale british air commander who is surveying engine damage on one of the spitfires.}

<D>__{rafe mccawley, sir.}
<A>__{rafe salutes as the air commander turns and then returns the salute, with his left arm his right arm is gone. rafe freezes at the sight, reminded of danny's father.}
<C>__{british air commander}
<D>__{on loan from colonel doolittle, is it?}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{that's me, sir.}
<C>__{british air commander}
<D>__{good on you, then, rafe mccawley. we'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{if you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.}
<C>__{british air commander}
<D>__{are all the yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, lieutenant?}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{not anxious to die, sir, anxious to matter.}
