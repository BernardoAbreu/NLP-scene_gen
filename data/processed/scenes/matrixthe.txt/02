<A>__{the hotel was abandoned after a fire licked its way across the polyester carpeting, destroying several rooms as it spooled soot up the walls and ceiling leaving patterns of permanent shadow. we follow four armed police officers using flashlights as they creep down the blackened hall and ready themselves on either side of room 303. the biggest of them violently kicks in the door the other cops pour in behind him, guns thrust before them.}

<D>__{police! freeze!}
<A>__{the room is almost devoid of furniture. there is a fold up table and chair with a phone, a modern, and a powerbook computer. the only light in the room is the glow of the computer. sitting there, her hands still on the keyboard, is trinity; a woman in black leather.}
