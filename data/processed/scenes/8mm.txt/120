<D>__{you've got penthouse, playboy, hustler, etc. nobody even considers them pornography anymore. then, there's mainstream hardcore. triple x. the difference is penetration. that's hardcore. that whole industry's up in the valley. writers, directors, porn stars. they're celebrities, or they think they are. they pump out 150 videos a week. a week. they've even got a porno academy awards. america loves pornography. anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying. somebody's buying those videos. somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex. know what else? it's only gonna get worse. more and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution. desensitization. oh my god, elvis presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive! nowadays, mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out. know what i mean? for the porn addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while. they have to be the biggest tits ever. some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally. soon, playboy is gonna be penthouse, penthouse'll be hustler, hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. people'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. there's nowhere else for it to go.}

<D>__{what you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend. we're talking about stuff where people get hurt. specialty product.}

<D>__{child pornography.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{there's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal. foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal. this is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love. now, with some of the s+m and bondage films, they straddle the line. how are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not? step over that line, you're into kiddie porn. rape films, but there aren't many. i've never seen one.}

<D>__{i heard you asking. that guy wasn't yanking you around. there's no such thing.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{what other ways are there to get illegal films? who do you see?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{first of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer. it's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet. anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants. it's heaven for those degenerate chicken hawks. they're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em. but, there's still some weird shit under the counter where i work sometimes. no one knows where it comes from. that's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth. those are zombies, hardcore junkies. their hands are permanently pruned. they go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister. other than that, all i know about is the mail. classified ads in the paper with hidden codes. secret couriers. credit card orders to dummy corporations. interstate wire transfers. revolving p.o. boxes. but, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows? that's the whole point the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal. there's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is.}
