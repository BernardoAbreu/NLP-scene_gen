<L>__{interior conference hall day}
<A>__{as the applause finally begins to diminish, the nsc firebrand turns and nods to a church choir director, off to the side. the choir director brings his choir onto the stage.}
<C>__{nsc firebrand}
<D>__{brothers, sisters ... join us in our anthem.}
<A>__{anyone not standing, stands. the choir director raises his hands. the choir inhales. go.}
<C>__{choir}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{nkosi sikelel' iafrica etc (god bless africa) }
<A>__{but before the first line is fully sung, an assistant rushes out, whispers urgently into the nsc firebrand's ear. the firebrand's eyes bug out in surprise. he crosses to the choir director, says something quickly. the choir director stops the choir in mid chorus. consternation everywhere. what's going on?}
<C>__{nsc firebrand}
<D>__{brothers, sisters, members of the choir we would only interrupt such beautiful music for something truly important. in this case, for someone truly important.}
<P>__{(beat, milking it)}
<D>__{please welcome president mandela!}
<A>__{the place goes berserk as mandela enters, with linga at his back, and surprise, surprise hendrick booyens leading the way. face stern and unsmiling, mandela walks the length of the hall towards the podium. the delegates press in towards them. another angle jason coordinates security inside and out. lifts his radio to his mouth.}
<C>__{jason}
<P>__{(into radio)}
<D>__{smile.}
<A>__{on hendrick, as his standard bad bastard scowl suddenly becomes a smile which scares the throng more than the scowl did. on linga, the same. another angle barbara enters at the back of the hall, accompanied by kwezi. mandela reaches the podium, turns looks out over the crowd, face thunderous. when they see his anger, the crowd quietens down quickly.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{brothers, sisters, comrades, i am here because i feel strongly that you made a decision today without sufficient information or foresight.}
<A>__{he lectures them like a headmaster. they don't like it.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{i am aware of your earlier vote. i am aware that it was unanimous.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{nonetheless, i propose that we restore the springboks. restore their name, their emblem and their colors, immediately.}
<A>__{instant and complete silence in the hall. this is utterly unpopular. shocked faces, especially from the executive and the nsc firebrand. on barbara, as she sees her worst political nightmare playing out in front of her.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{let me tell you why ...}
<A>__{murmurs of disapproval and disagreement begin to rise. mandela's going to have to row upstream on this one.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{... on robben island, in pollsmoor prison, my jailers were all afrikaners.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{for twenty seven years, i studied them. i learned their language, i read their history, i read their poetry. i had to know my enemy, in order to prevail against him.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and we prevailed, did we not? all of us here ... we prevailed.}
<A>__{for the first time, mandela says something the crowd likes.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{our enemy is no longer the afrikaner. they are our fellow south africans, our partners in democracy.}
<A>__{just as quickly, mandela loses them again.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{and they treasure springbok rugby. if we take that away, we lose them. we prove that we are what they feared we would be.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we have to be better than that.}
<C>__{mandela }
<D>__{we have to surprise them with compassion, with restraint, and generosity.}
<A>__{the grumbling and disagreement becomes noticeably louder.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{yes, i know. all the things they denied us.}
<A>__{on hendrick, totally engrossed in his job, eyes sweeping across the crowd, feeling the tension.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{but this is not the time to enjoy a moment's petty revenge. this is the time to build our nation using every single brick available to us even if that brick comes clothed in green and gold.}
<A>__{the crowd is growing more restless and rebellious by the moment. linga is as alert as hendrick, tuned in to the jumpy vibe.}
<C>__{mandela}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{you elected me.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you elected me to be your leader. let me lead you now.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{who is with me on this?}
<A>__{it's almost as if he's daring them to go against him.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{who is with me?}
<A>__{the murmuring becomes a dull roar of argument and disagreement. on barbara as she closes her eyes and lowers her head: this is a fiasco.}
