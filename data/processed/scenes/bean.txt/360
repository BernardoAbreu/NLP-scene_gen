<L>__{exterior the grierson gallery day.}
<A>__{half an hour later. police cars draw up. bernie is shoved in the back seat of one. grierson, bean & david watch.}
<C>__{grierson}
<P>__{(to uniformed cop)}
<D>__{i don't know what your methods are these days, officer, but i'd also ask him a few questions about the destruction of the whistler copy.}
<A>__{bean nods his head firmly. the car pulls away. then breaks and reverses. the side kick gets out.}
<C>__{side kick}
<D>__{oh, yeah i forgot.}
<A>__{side kick opens the back of the car. he takes out a huge bunch of flowers.}
<D>__{the chief said i was to give you these.}
<A>__{bean is delighted. then sniffs the flowers. what a nasty stink. not his sort of thing at all. side kick drives away. grierson turns to david.}
<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{i owe you a very serious apology, young man. it wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this. i sincerely hope that you do not.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{very accommodating well, no, sir, i'm sure ...}
<A>__{he looks sideways to bean, who is frantically pointing to his spine. david gets the message, and changes his tune..}
<D>__{let me think about that, thomas. we'd have to talk quite a salary hike.}
<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{and a car.}
<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{mmmmm...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{maybe two cars.}
<C>__{grierson}
<D>__{a car sounds sensible.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{and i need fridays off, to spend more time with my family. speaking of which if you'll excuse me .... i've got a lot of time to make up.}
<A>__{david heads off. bean wants to follow, but needs to get rid of the stinky flowers. he turns to annie and gives them to her to be rid of them. she beams with delight: after all, he did love her. bean heads off with david to the parking lot. as they go, david puts an arm round bean. who shoos him away instantly. no sloppiness for him.}
