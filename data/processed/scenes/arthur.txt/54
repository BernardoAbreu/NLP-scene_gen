<L>__{exterior balcony night}
<A>__{the live version of simon and garfunkel's `the 59th street bridge song (feelin' groovy') is playing on speakers. arthur and naomi look out over the view, the park, dark and empty in contrast to the cheering and clapping on the recording. naomi sips her wine. arthur throws back a whisky.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{your kids' book. what was it about?}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{`vlad the inhaler'. about an asthmatic boy detective.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{be serious.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{oh, it was dumb. `the boy whose heart escaped'. it was about this kid who wakes up to find his heart has climbed out and is shinning down the drainpipe to freedom.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i love it.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{rainbow press said it was too disturbing. but it wasn't literal there wasn't a kid lying there with a gaping hole in his chest. it was just this cute little heart bouncing up and down shouting `you can't catch me, mofo!'. i'm paraphrasing.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{did he catch the heart?}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{never got that far.}
<A>__{arthur wobbles a little more.}
<C>__{naomi }
<D>__{you like the hooch, don't you?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{only if i'm sad, happy or bored. there's this bit in a book hobson used to read me as a kid that says it all: `we must stop eating cookies, frog!' cried toad, as he ate another.'}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{frog and toad! i loved frog and toad!}
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(from memory)}
<D>__{`frog put the cookies in a box. `there' he said. now we will not eat any more cookies.' `but we can open the box.' frog tied some string around the box. `there' he said, `now we will not eat any more cookies'. `but we can cut the string and open the box'.}
<A>__{naomi lays her head on arthur's shoulder.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{so frog took the box outside. he shouted in a loud voice, `hey birds, here are cookies!' birds came from everywhere. they picked up all the cookies in their beaks and flew away. `}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{now we have no more cookies to eat' `excellent!' said toad, `i am going home now to bake a cake.'}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{classic addict.}
<A>__{they might be about to kiss. but arthur holds back.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{that was beautiful. it's like you read it yesterday.}
