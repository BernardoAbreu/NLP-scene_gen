<L>__{interior foods and nutrition room next period}
<A>__{students file into the home economics room. the blackboard reads, today: tiramisu. the ingredients are listed below. seth is talking to the cooking teacher.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{mrs. grier, i joined this class because i thought i'd be cooking with a partner. it's not fair. she's never here. i don't get twice the marks for doing all the work.}
<C>__{mrs. greir}
<D>__{i didn't invent odd numbers, seth.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{look at evan.}
<A>__{evan is playfully throwing flour at a tiny japanese boy. they both laugh hard.}
<C>__{seth }
<D>__{while i'm over in my unit, isolated and alone, eating my terrible tasting food because i can't even properly mix ingredients by myself, i gotta look over at that.}
<A>__{the japanese boy ties evan's apron. evan then turns around and ties the boy's apron. they both look happy.}
<C>__{seth }
<D>__{i wash and dry. and that is b.s. i'm like a single mother.}
<C>__{mrs. greir}
<D>__{well, save it for next week. today jules' partner isn't here either. pair up with her. station four.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{jules?}
<A>__{the teacher walks away. seth looks over to station four, nervous as hell. angle on: jules, well dressed and "popular" looking. she stands alone at station four, laying out utensils. seth musters his courage and walks towards jules. he stops, unsure of what to say.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{hey seth, your partner didn't come again?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{that's kind of a personal question.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(nervous)}
<D>__{nothing. it was my attempt at humour.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{well, uh, maybe i kidnapped her so you'd be forced to work with me. there's my attempt at humour.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{well, i would call that a success.}
<P>__{(reading recipe sheet)}
<D>__{marscampone... scamponee cheese? is that some kind of new cheese or something?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{all cheese tastes the same to me anyway.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{except blue cheese. that stuff is sick.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{thank you! yes! my older brother always eats blue cheese. you know that stuff is actually moldy. like, they tell you it's moldy, then they tell you to eat it anyway.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{well whoever "they" are, they can eat my dick.}
