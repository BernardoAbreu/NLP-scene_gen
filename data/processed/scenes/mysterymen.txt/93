<L>__{interior v.i.p. lounge in frankenstein tower continuous}
<A>__{a sumptuous, hotel like lounge. anabel is holding court with all of top crooks from the luncheon, charrning the pants off them... casanova slithers up behind her.}
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{fellas, this is woman without whom i would have gone sane.}

<L>__{exterior front gate of the frankenstein center continuous}
<A>__{a pair of security guards (the same two who got gassed by the spleen) are on duty, when they see... a strange looking vehicle chugging up the hill straight for them.}
<C>__{guard 1}
<D>__{what the hell is that?}
<C>__{guard 2}
<D>__{looks like... a ford dumpster.}
<A>__{they have a good laugh at it, then hold up their hands for it to stop... but the herkimer just rolls past them, hitting the iron gates and snapping them open as if they were made of match sticks.}
<C>__{guards}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{they open fire. inside the herkimer continuous bullets are heard pinging off the herk as through the windshield just ahead we see the long stairway heading up to the front door of the art center.}
<C>__{shoveler}
<D>__{hang on!}
