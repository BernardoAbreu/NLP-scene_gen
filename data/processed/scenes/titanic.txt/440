<A>__{it is a thundering black hell. men scream as monstrous machinery comes apart around them, steel frames twisting like taffy. their torches illuminate the roaring, foaming demon of water as it races at the through the manchines. trying to climb they are overtaken in seconds.}

<L>__{exterior titanic night}
<A>__{the stern alf of the ship, almost four hundred feet long, falls back toward the water. on the poop deck everyone screams as they feel themselves plummeting. the sound goes up like the roar of fans at a baseball stadium when a run is scored. swimming in the water directly under the stern a few unfortunates shriek as they see the keel coming down on them like god's bootheel. the massive stern section falls back almost level, thundering down into the sea and pushing out a mighty wave of displaced water. jack and rose struggle to hole onto the stern rail. they feel the ship seemingly right itself. some of those praying think it is salvation.}
<C>__{several people}
<A>__{we're saved! jack looks at rose and shakes his head, grimly. now the horrible mechanics play out. pulled down by the awesome weight of the flooded bow, the buoyant stern tilts up rapidly. they feel the rush of ascent as the fantail angles up again. everyone is clinging to benches, railings, ventilators... anything to keep from sliding as the stern lifts. the stern goes up and up, past 45 degrees, then past sixty. people start to fall, sliding and tumbling. they skid down the deck, screaming and flailing to grab onto somehting. they wrench other people loose and pull them down as well. there is a pile up of bodies at the forward rail. the dahl family falls one by one.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{we have to move! he climbs over the stern rail and reaches back for rose. she is terrified to move. he grabs her hand.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{come on! i've got you! jack pulls her over the rail. it is the same place he pulled her over the rail two nights earlier, going the other direction. she gets over just as the railing is going horizontal, and the deck veritcal. jack grips her fiercely. the stern is now straight up in the air... a rumbling black monolith standing against the stars. it hangs there like that for a long grace note, its buoyancy stable. rose lies on the railing, looking down fifteen stories to the boiling sea at the base of the stern section. people near them, who didn't climb over, hang from the railing, their legs dangling over the long drop. they fall one by one, plummeting down the vertical face of the poop deck. some of them bounce horribly off deck benches and ventilators. jack and rose lie side by side on what was the vertical face of the hull, gripping the railing, which is now horizontal. just beneath their feet are the gold letters titanic emblazoned across the stern. rose stares down terrified at the black ocean waiting below to claim them. jack looks to his left and sees baker joughin, crouching on the hull, holding onto the railing. it is a surreal moment.}

<P>__{(nodding a greeting)}
<A>__{helluva night. the final relentless plunge begins as the stern section floods. looking down a hundred feet to the water, we drop like an elevator with jack and rose.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(talking fast)}
<A>__{take a deep breath and hold it right before we go into the water. the ship will suck us down. kick for the surface and keep kicking. don't let go of my hand. we're gonna make it rose. trust me. she stares at the water coming up at them, and grips his hand harder.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{i trust you. below them the poop deck is disappearing. the plunge gathers speed... the boiling surface engulfs the docking bridge and then rushes up the last thirty feet.}
