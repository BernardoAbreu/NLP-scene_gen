<L>__{interior front hall}
<A>__{jill reaches the front door. carefully, quietly, she turns the bolt. then o.s. she hears a creak. she turns and looks up the staircase. at the top, a door is opening. someone is coming out! a mumbling sound is heard on the sound track. jill whirls around back to the door and yanks at it. it opens, but only an inch. the chain is still across it! she frantically works to get the chain free. after agonizing seconds, the chain falls clear and the door swings open. standing there on the other side of the door, is a police detective, john clifford. (we have cut ahead in time some twenty or thirty minutes.) behind him on the street, several patrol cars and an ambulance are pulled up at the curb, their domelights silently flashing.}

<D>__{are the parents here yet?}
<C>__{cop's voice }
<D>__{yeah, they arrived about ten minutes ago.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{christ!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what a homecoming!}
<C>__{cop's voice }
<D>__{they wanted to talk to someone. i asked them to wait until you got here. come on in.}
<A>__{clifford sighs and steps into the front hall. the door is closed by the uniformed cop with whom clifford has been speaking. the cop is a man in his thirties. his name is charles garber. garber and clifford stand in the front hall and talk as policemen and ambulance attendants move around them. in the living room beyond can be seen several other policemen, dr. mandrakis and his wife.}
<C>__{garber}
<D>__{we were only a block away when the call went out. when we got here, the guy was still waiting upstairs in the children's bedroom. he was covered with blood.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{blood?}
<C>__{garber}
<D>__{not his own. the children had been dead for several hours.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{jesus...}
<C>__{garber}
<D>__{he'd been using an old phone in their bedroom that the parents had never had disconnected.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{who is he?}
<C>__{garber}
<D>__{we found a merchant seaman's card on him. he's english. entered the country less than a week ago.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{how about the babysitter?}
<C>__{garber}
<D>__{she's going to be all right.}
<A>__{as garber delivers his final line, we see ambulance attendants dressed in white, taking a sheet covered stretcher out the front door.}
