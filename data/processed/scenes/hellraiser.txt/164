<L>__{interior corridor to hell night}
<A>__{she steps into the corridor. the walls rise into darkness on either side of her, their surfaces like the interior of a pyramid, pitted with age, and rotting away. she starts towards the sobbing child, bare feet on the impacted earth of the passageway. the sobbing gets louder as she advances, her form disappearing entirely as she passes through the intermittent darkness. once, she glances back towards the hospital room, to reassure herself that it's still there. it is, though it's no more than a sliver of light at the far end of the passageway. she advances a few more paces. the atmosphere is growing denser; smoke thickens the air. then, a light glows at the other end of the corridor. the sound of the sobbing child ceases. she stops walking. ahead, the smoke clears and the light brightens, and we see a creature the engineer hanging in the space between the walls. it is in silhouette against the light, but we can see enough to know that it resembles no earthly animal. its vast black limbs hold it suspended above the corridor, clinging to the stone. its front limbs, vestigial by comparison, hang down from beneath its vast head. its tail is curled over its back. kirsty's expression registers this horror. the engineer moves into the light. its irises narrow to slits. from the tail a vast sting, oozing pus like venom, glides into view. and then it comes at her, advancing along the corridor by bracing its legs against the walls. its breath is a growl in its belly, until it moves into darkness, when all sound from it ceases, only to erupt again as it finds the light. kirsty turns, and starts to run. it comes after her at speed. darkness, light, darkness, light; roars and silence its jaws spill its thick saliva; its eyes gleam. kirsty runs blindly down the corridor, back towards the safety of the hospital room. but it's very close on her heels, lingering as she comes within a few yards of the room it closes on her.}
