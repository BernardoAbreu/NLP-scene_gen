<L>__{107 exterior thames outside parliament}
<A>__{splash! holmes dives into the river handcuffed. he disappears for a moment then surfaces, looks about in the water. a moment of concern until we hear the familiar "chug" of a struggling engine. holmes looks in the water and sees a rope trailing on the surface. he grabs it with his hands. and... it pulls him closer to the rickety boat of captain tanner. watson stands on the rear deck, pulling holmes in on the rope. irene is also present. when holmes is level, watson leans over and clips off his cuffs using bolt cutters. clearly the whole escape has been planned. holmes is pulled up into the boat.}
<C>__{tanner}
<P>__{(to watson)}
<D>__{i told you he'd be coming out the top window, soldier boy. no way he'd be coming over the terrace.}
<A>__{watson hands over the change from the engagement ring. tanner takes it happily.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{how was lestrade?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{performed his role perfectly. a little too perfectly, come to think of it.}
<A>__{watson has the paper that holmes gave him in the attic.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{well, your instructions were fairly precise... about everything except the window.}
<A>__{tanner smiles, still pleased with himself.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{where to, sherlock?}
<A>__{holmes points to a dark recess in the embankment.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{port side, captain tanner, into the sewers.}
<A>__{tanner turns the boat. irene looks out, her eyes narrow.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{watson, did you bring my clothes?}
<A>__{watson hands over a pile of clothes and holmes' pistol. holmes opens the drum, checks the load, grimaces, pockets it. he's never going to like guns. then holmes reaches inside a pocket of clothes he is still wearing, and pulls out the hip flask that he took from the men at the slaughterhouse. he takes a shot.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{starting early, aren't we?}
<A>__{he offers the flask to her.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{trust me, have a drink.}
<A>__{she can see this is more than a social invitation, she takes a hit, pulls a face. holmes nods towards watson, irene passes him the bottle. he drinks, grimaces, hands it on to tanner, who swallows it without flinching, wipes his mouth, smiles. the boat is almost at the sewers.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{what are we doing in the sewers?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{patience, doctor. i am about to show you...}
<A>__{as they head toward the sewers, holmes glances up toward big ben, the time moving toward noon.}
