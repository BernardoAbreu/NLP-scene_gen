<L>__{interior caroline and toby's room afternoon}
<A>__{the place is pretty bleak: a room and a half, murphy beds, linoleum floors, and a bath down the hall. caroline and toby enter. she pulls down the murphy bed and falls onto it fully dressed, saying:}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{my head is killing me.}
<A>__{toby heads for his room. same scene dusk caroline wakes up with a start, then sees toby sitting in a chair, watching her.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{what time is it?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{seven. almost.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{why didn't you wake me?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i started dinner. the potatoes are frying, and i'm heating up the hot dogs.}
<A>__{caroline sees that he's trying to make it up to her, and pats the bed for him to sit down next to her. he moves to sit beside her.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{hold your mother's hand.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i know you are, honey. ah, well it wasn't fire, and nobody bled, so i guess we're okay.}
<A>__{the telephone rings and she answers it. when she hears the voice on the other end she once again touches her right cheekbone with a finger the spot where the bruise had been. she sags back against a wall.}

<D>__{yes...}
<P>__{(listens)}
<D>__{yes...}

<A>__{caroline hangs up.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{who was that?}
<A>__{she closes her eyes.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{who was that?}
<A>__{caroline laughs aloud, then slides down the wall until she's on the floor still laughing.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{we've got a guest for dinner: it's roy. he tracked us down.}
<A>__{toby groans and falls full length onto the sofa.}
