<A>__{two huge stacks of goods are ablaze and the nazis are having trouble getting water to them. the nazis main concern at this point is an enormous, neat stack of wooden cartridge boxes which are piled down the wall from one of the already blazing, and now teetering, stacks of general goods. nervous nazis are moving the heavy cartridge boxes as fast as they can, but it's slow work and the threatening fire is close. indy and marion make their way along the side of the center court, indy grimacing with the strain of pulling the ark. one nazi stops directly in front of them, looking at them queerly. indy knocks him out with the butt of his luger just as marion is about to fire. out in the court, shliemann has regained his eyesight. now he crouches, scanning the scene desperately for indy. he looks into the remains of the tabernacle and spots the empty altar. beyond it, the unoccupied posts where marion was bound. at the entrance to the second train tunnel, indy and marion struggle to lift the ark into a mine car. marion has the submachine gun slung over her back. the ark drops heavily into the bottom of the car. the noise attracts the attention of five water carrying nazis. they see what's going on and reach for their side arms. indy grabs marion, pulls her in front of him as though to use her as a shield and flips the submachine gun, still on her back, toward the nazis. he opens fire, turning marion's body so he can mow all five down. shliemann spins around and looks at the tunnel entrance. he points at indy and marion, who have just hopped into the mine car with the ark.}

<A>__{a dozen nazis spin and look at the mine car. marion is just leveling the submachine gun. indy pushes forward the throttle and the mine car moves toward the tunnel, picking up speed. as the nazis raise their guns to fire, marion and indy both open up, peppering the area with lead. as the mine car is about to disappear into the tunnel }

<A>__{as the car disappears, bullets pock the entrance of the tunnel. shliemann runs up with three nazis. they jump into the next mine car and take off, disappearing into the tunnel. over at the burning stack of goods, some terrified fire fighters scurry away as the burning pile of general goods falls over onto the stack of cartridge boxes. the wooden boxes immediately start burning. many of the nazis just want to get out of there, but a couple of disciplined officers are trying to salvage the situation. they point to the far side of the court, the walls are lines with oil and gas drums.}
