<A>__{bunker's eyes bug out as he sees pappas coming through the door. he snaps the assault rifle to his shoulder. suddenly johnny is behind him half in the bathroom window, pistol gripped double handed like they taught him in quantico.}

<D>__{fbi!! drop it!}
<A>__{bunker whips around. squeezing off a wild burst! b b b blam! it rips the plaster next to johnny's shoulder. shatters the shower door behind him. the black haired girl screams. johnny flinches, firing rapidly. wild. bunker drops, hit. warchild lets go with the 12 gauge. kaboom! takes a chunk like a shark bite out of the doorframe by johnny's head. deafening in the confined space. johnny flattens himself behind the doorframe. tone just splits. down the hall like a greyhound. pappas is on one knee, his piece drawn fast, holding fiberglass in a neck lock with one massive arm. bunker, wild eyed and bleeding, is on his knees in the bathroom doorway. he raises the steyr. mistake. angelo fires. 30 years in the field tends to show. three rounds. chest. chest. head. bunker is off the planet. munoz kicks the backdoor in like they do in the movies. he and cole charge into the rancid kitchen. badass fbi agents. johnny, hotwired and hyperventilating, pops out for a shot around the doorframe. he gets a glimpse of warchild's back disappearing into the hallway. fires. his shot is wasted, punching plaster. suddenly a pink freight train hits him. he forgot about the girl in the shower. naked except for her tattoos, she bodyslams him face first into the wall. as he tries to turn she grabs his hair in both hands and hammers his head into the medicine cabinet crash shattering the mirror. then she knees him in the balls as he ricochets off the wall into her. she drives her elbow into his back as he drops. "freight train" lands knee first on his gun hand, and viciously kicks the pistol away with one bloody foot. it skitters under the bed. she's cut up from flying glass. demon eyed and wired, her body lithe and muscular under white skin. she sprints across the bedroom, leaving utah slumped, heaving for breath. in the hallway, tone is hidden behind a doorway. white knuckling the forty five. a wild eyed kid with a big gun and not the slightest idea how to use it. he hears footsteps pounding behind him and spins. it's warchild, running with the shot gun.}

<D>__{move it, man. let's get the fuck out of here!}
<A>__{off guard, tone is slammed by the door as munoz drives into it with his shoulder. pounded between the door and wall, tone is wired so tight he pulls the trigger and blows a hole through his own right foot. he screams and drops to the floor. munoz sandwiches him with the door and draws down on warchild, who dives into a doorway. cole drives past munoz, who has tone pinned, and pounds down the corridor. cole reaches the doorway and goes for the shot on warchild. "freight train" appears behind him from another door. she raises a pair of scissors and drives them into his back up to the hilt. pulls them out, going for another stab, when pappas spins her around and slams her face first into the wall. utah, in the bedroom, sees warchild blur across his field of vision. on pure instinct, he kicks into overdrive. johnny leaps the bed and goes ballistic. his flying tackle catches warchild at the window.}
