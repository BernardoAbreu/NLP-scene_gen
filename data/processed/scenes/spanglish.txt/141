<A>__{deborah and cristina standing in a grass bordered parking lot...deborah, feigning upset, tearing into her bag but her focus is elsewhere as she periodically looks off. she is clearly stalling.}
<C>__{deborah }
<D>__{can't find my keys..}

<P>__{(barbara boxer couldn't do it better)}
<D>__{hello..a pleasure to meet you, ms. folsom. i couldn't believe how beautiful the grounds were as we drove in. i just think the balance of the buildings to open ground is so wonderful and must have been very difficult to achieve.}
<A>__{deborah smiles with pride at the elegant first impression cristina is making..all are grinning...the two adults suspiciously so...sharing their delight.}
<C>__{arlene}
<D>__{would you like a little tour?}

<C>__{narrator}
<D>__{the experience was literally mind boggling. my mind did boggle. my cranial cells stunned. even if i had enough sense of wonder to imagine such a school existed; my sense of fairness made it unthinkable that any school could offer this much more than my own..}
