<A>__{his eyes on a little boy who's walking into the party, sitting down with the others, ignored, isolated, a birthday cap on his head. clothes belong to the 1940's and the face seems familiar. jim is not sure, woozy from the cognac. as he fades. we saw the boy many years ago in the backseat of the car in the arizona desert. jim's head falling gently into his folded arms on the table, the cognac bottle at his elbow, merlin hat on, beard, the kids laughing, pulling his ears and nose he doesn't wake up.}
