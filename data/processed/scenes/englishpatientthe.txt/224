<D>__{i looked up to you, uncle. my brother always said i was a fool. never trust the british, he said: the deal makers, the map makers; never shake hands with them.}
<C>__{the patient}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{what have i been doing all this time? do you know how many mines i've seen? more mines than there are soldiers, more how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky. and now this.}
<A>__{he approaches the bed. caravaggio tries to intervene.}
<C>__{caravaggio}

<A>__{kip sings the rifle at him, knocking him to the floor.}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{i said keep out of this!}
<A>__{he pulls of his earphones and rams them around the patient's head, dropping the set onto the bed. the patient listens, coughing.}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{can you hear? can you hear what they're celebrating? i listened to you, uncle. sitting at your feet always sitting at somebody's feet trying to learn. the right way to hold a teacup, otherwise you're out, the pukkah knot in your tie as if everything can be explained in terms of a cricket bat and an accent.}
<C>__{caravaggio}
<D>__{kip }
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{kip! it's not even my name because you can't say it. kirpal singh bhuller is my name.}

<C>__{caravaggio}
<D>__{kip, listen, he lost everything because he wasn't english jesus! shoot me, i'm more english than he is!}
<A>__{kip levels the gun at the patient. then breaks it open, throws it down on the bed, next to the earphones, from which the news continues to leak, some words audible eunola gay... hiroshima... and from different voices it was beautiful! just beautiful! bang! the biggest bang you ever saw!}
