<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{no. i can't back that up. i was just grasping at straws. i had nothing. but isn't it interesting, mr. powers, you really have become a product of the nineties.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{how so?}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{you're more interested in your job as glorified policeman than you are in love. you won the battle, but i won the war. love means nothing, you've proved it.}

<D>__{what a cowardly response. i'm disappointed really. you have the power to go back in time and save her, but it means letting me go.}
<A>__{austin looks over and sees a time portal. through it he can glimpse the lair, and felicity.}
