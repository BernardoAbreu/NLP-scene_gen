<A>__{a police officer has three marines in dress blues and one zoot suiter cornered in a center walkway. the marines swipe clumsily at the officer with their two by fours as he bobs back and forth on the balls of his feet, dodging the blows like the ex fighter he is.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{i already knew him by reputation, had our respective records down pat: lee blanchard, 43 4 2 as a heavyweight, formerly a regular attraction at the hollywood legion stadium.}
<A>__{the terrified mexican stands frozen on one side of blanchard, trying to avoid the entire mess as the policeman parries the marines' blows with his own truncheon.}
<C>__{lee blanchard}
<D>__{code three, bleichert!}
<A>__{bucky runs into the courtyard and immediately wades in, fending off the marines' blows to jab at them with his stick.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{and he knew me, bucky bleichert, light heavy, 36 0 0, ranked tenth by ring magazine in 1937 fighting no name opponents in no man's land division.}
<A>__{on instinct, bucky drops his baton and begins wailing on the marines with his fists, connecting hard punches with soft midsections.}
<C>__{voice over }
<D>__{in our first year at central we'd never spoke but people spoke of us. opinions about a fantasy bleichert blanchard fight, and who would win.}
<A>__{and now blanchard moves in, lashing vicious truncheon blows to the shoulders of the marines, sending them one by one into a heap.}
<C>__{voice over }
<D>__{i'd heard almost all of 'em: blanchard by early ko; bleichert by decision; blanchard stopped on cuts everything but bleichert by knockout.}
<A>__{the marines reduced to rubble, lee blanchard turns his attention to the zooter: he slaps handcuffs on him and leads him away. he motions for bucky to follow. lee turns back to the marines:}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{to the halls of tripoli, shitbirds.}
<A>__{one of them flips lee off. the zooter kicks him in the chest as lee pulls him away from them, laughing. the three men start back toward the riots. gunshots can be heard. palm trees blaze up into the night.}
