<L>__{interior precinct house, captain's office day}
<A>__{mills and somerset stand together. the captain is behind his desk with the d.a., martin talbot, seated in front of him. mark swarr addresses them all, seems nervous, but in control.}
<C>__{swarr}
<D>__{my client says there are two more bodies... two more dead, hidden away. he will take detective mills to these bodies, but only detective mills. only at six o'clock, today.}
<A>__{swarr wipes his brow with a handkerchief.}
<C>__{talbot}
<D>__{oh, christ.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{why me?}
<C>__{swarr}
<D>__{he says he admires you.}
<C>__{somerset}
<P>__{(to captain)}
<D>__{this is all part of his game plan.}
<C>__{swarr}
<D>__{mr. doe claims that if the detective does not accept this offer, the bodies will never be found.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{frankly, counselor, i'm inclined to let them rot.}
<A>__{mills walks up into swarr's face.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{you like what you do for a living?}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{back off, mills.}
<C>__{swarr}
<D>__{i'm required by law to serve my clients to the best of my ability, and to serve their interests.}
<A>__{mills eases off. talbot is agitated, tapping a finger on the gold tooth in his mouth. he looks at swarr.}
<C>__{talbot}
<D>__{we don't make deals like this.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{we're going to have to pass.}
<C>__{swarr}
<D>__{my client... he also wishes that i inform you, if you do not accept, he will plead insanity, across the board.}
<C>__{talbot}
<D>__{let him try. i'd like to see him try!}
<C>__{swarr}
<D>__{come now, martin. even he knows, with the nature of these crimes, i could get him off with such a plea.}
<A>__{talbot stands, wringing his hands. mills and somerset are looking at each other, thinking it over.}
<C>__{talbot}
<D>__{i'm not letting this conviction slide. i can tell you that, right here and right now!}
<C>__{swarr}
<D>__{he says, if you accept, under his specific conditions, he will sign a full confession and plead guilty... right here, and right now.}
<A>__{talbot looks at swarr with hatred.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{i will do it.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{hold on... just a minute.}
<A>__{somerset turns to talbot.}
<C>__{somerset }
<D>__{if he were to plead insanity... this conversation is admissible. the fact that he's blackmailing us with his plea...}
<C>__{swarr}
<D>__{and, my client reminds you, two more people are dead. the press would have a field day if they found out the police didn't seem too concerned about finding them... giving them proper burial.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{i will do it. i want to finish it.}
<A>__{somerset is thinking it through. he looks at mills.}
<C>__{somerset}
<P>__{(to captain)}
<D>__{well... let's get the fucking lawyer out of the room, and we can talk about how this whole thing's going to go down.}
