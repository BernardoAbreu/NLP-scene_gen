<A>__{kale reclines in his chair, now furiously swatting the racketball against the wall with a racket. we pull back to reveal scuff marks on the walls and ceiling where kale has figured out the exact points to hit it allowing him to bounce the ball off multiple walls and return it perfectly to his hand. he swats it... and swats it...}

<A>__{kale's passed out in his chair, the racket still in his hand. he's about to fall out of the chair when a loud bang o.s. jolts him awake.}
<L>__{interior 2nd floor hallway window day seconds later}
<A>__{kale goes to the window, tilts his head, trying to see where the noise is coming from. kale's pov he's able to make out some bits of movement next door, but his view is obstructed by the architecture of his house. kale steps back from the window, studies it a beat then opens it, slowly sticks his head out. his pov a u haul truck comes into view. it's backed into the driveway next door. alan norris, 43, appears from inside the truck's cab, carrying a moving box. he hands it down to his wife, bonnie, 42, who walks back in the house. kale's about to pull his head in when another person comes out of the moving truck. she's carrying a box that's obscuring her face as she carefully negotiates the incline of the moving truck's ramp. but her blonde hair and perfect legs look to be about 17. we'll soon know her as ashley, the norris' daughter. she reaches the end of the ramp. bends over to retrieve another smaller box, her back and ass to kale who stares in utter disbelief. ashley stacks the boxes, picks them up and heads into the house, her face still a mystery. kale watches her go. mesmerized. suddenly, the doorbell rings o.s. kale snaps to, yanks his head back in and kerbongs it on the underside of the window. he drops to the floor.}
