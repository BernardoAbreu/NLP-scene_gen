<A>__{vosen's sitting.}
<C>__{vosen}
<P>__{(to waiter)}
<D>__{sparkling. and a "heart healthy" omelet with goat cheese and peppers.}
<A>__{landy arrives.}
<C>__{vosen}
<D>__{you're late. traffic?}
<C>__{waiter}
<P>__{(handing her the menu)}
<D>__{ma'am?}
<C>__{landy}
<D>__{nothing for me.}
<A>__{vosen looks at her, surprised.}
<C>__{vosen}
<D>__{i'm buying.}
<A>__{she shakes her head, no. she sits, without taking her coat off. she's not staying long.}
<C>__{vosen}
<D>__{when the director called, it was suggested we bring you on }
<C>__{landy}
<D>__{suggested?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{are you sure it was just a suggestion?}
<C>__{vosen}
<D>__{funny how different things look depending on where you sit. i look at this as doing a favor for you. giving you an opportunity to complete some unfinished business.}
<C>__{landy}
<D>__{meaning?}
<C>__{vosen}
<D>__{jason bourne.}
<C>__{landy}
<D>__{bourne's finished.}
<C>__{vosen}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{landy}
<D>__{it was finished the moment i realized i was chasing him for something he didn't do. the case is closed.}
<C>__{vosen}
<D>__{so what do you make of this?}
<P>__{(handing her}
<D>__{surveillance photos of}
<P>__{bourne in paris)}
<D>__{french intel picked up bourne meeting pierre elattrache on tuesday. he threatened to burn our house down if you didn't tell him who started treadstone. that's a big problem, wouldn't you agree?}
<C>__{landy}
<D>__{this doesn't feel like bourne to me.}
<C>__{vosen}
<D>__{why's it so hard for you to believe?}
<C>__{landy}
<D>__{probably because it's coming from you, noah.}
<C>__{vosen}
<D>__{lets try and be adults okay? we all thought he was done, off the grid. but bourne's back. maybe he's a threat. we both want the same thing here.}
<C>__{landy}
<D>__{so what happened at waterloo?}
<C>__{vosen}
<D>__{we have a leak. bourne showed up in our surveillance. we had very little time to react.}
<C>__{landy}
<D>__{and the reporter ended up dead?}
<C>__{vosen}
<D>__{bourne saw us coming.}
<A>__{landy looks at him, suspicious.}
<C>__{landy}
<D>__{so what was he doing? vosen? we don't know. but just the fact that he was there means he's up to something, don't you think? maybe he's the source?}
<C>__{landy}
<D>__{the real question is how you managed to get in a fire fight in the middle of a public train station.}
<C>__{vosen}
<D>__{don't second guess an operation from an armchair, pam. it's not fair.}
<C>__{landy}
<D>__{i'm going to the office now. i will make my own introductions.}
<A>__{off vosen...}
