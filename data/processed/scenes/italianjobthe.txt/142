<A>__{they get out of their cars and start yelling at each other.}
<C>__{handsome rob}
<D>__{never seen 'em before in my life.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior yevhen's coin & bullion store night}
<A>__{steve bangs a fist against the steel security door that covers the closed store. the steel door rises up and once again yevhen unlocks another door.}
<C>__{yevhen}
<D>__{you're early.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{and i'm in a hurry, okay?}
<L>__{interior yevhen's coins & bullion store night}
<A>__{it doesn't seem to matter if steve's in a hurry or not, yevhen still runs at the mouth while heading into the back room.}
<C>__{yevhen}
<D>__{of course the florida vote rigging was a cia and mob operation.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(with total disinterest)}
<D>__{that a fact?}
<C>__{yevhen}
<D>__{you want facts? fact: cia officials were allowed free and illegal access to official election material.}
<A>__{steve puts his duffel bag down on the table. it thuds. once again, he pulls out three gold bricks that each weigh 25 pounds.}
<C>__{yevhen}
<D>__{now given the sordid history in miami of joint ventures between central intelligence and the mob, which led to the unsuccessful attempts to kill fidel castro and the successful assassination of your president john f. kennedy, this conjunction raises numerous red flags.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{and i'd love to hear more about it, but like i said...}
<C>__{yevhen}
<D>__{don't worry, we'll have you out in no time. the cash is on its way.}
<A>__{steve cocks his head, as if he could not have heard right.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{on its way?}
<C>__{yevhen}
<D>__{my cousin is bringing it over.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{your cousin?}
<C>__{yevhen}
<D>__{yes. cousin mashkov.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{he's on his way?}
<C>__{yevhen}
<D>__{don't worry, he will be here any minute.}
<A>__{steve looks up to the security camera.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{the tape's off?}
<C>__{yevhen}
<D>__{of course. believe me, he doesn't want to be on video, either.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{yevhen. didn't i tell you, many times, that i never wanted to meet with anyone but you?}
<A>__{yevhen sweats a bit.}
<C>__{yevhen}
<D>__{i know. but it's his cash. he uses me to launder money. i'm just a middleman.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{and a middleman is supposed to stay in the middle.}
<C>__{yevhen}
<D>__{but you were early. please. don't worry. it will be fine. my cousin's a cool guy. like i am.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{what you are, is a dixie cup.}
<A>__{yevhen smiles quizzically, not sure if he's being complimented or insulted.}
<C>__{yevhen}
<D>__{dixie cup?}
<A>__{before the words are out of yevhen's mouth, steve grabs one of the 25 pound gold bricks and slaps it across yevhen's face, shattering his jaw. yevhen's falls to the floor and steve lifts the brick again and rams it down onto his head with an ugly thud. and again. and again. he then takes the gold brick slathered in blood and places it back in his duffle bag.}
