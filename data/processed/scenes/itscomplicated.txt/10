<A>__{jane flies into the elevator, out of breath and a little nauseous. she taps on the lobby button. the elevator moves down. ping. the doors open and jane looks into an empty hallway, facing a sign that reads, santa barbara fertility center. helping couples become parents. jane hears someone is about to get on the elevator, steps back toward the corner. a messy looking 5 year old boy dashes in. jane recognizes him. she looks up and jake and his wife, agness, in oversized dark shades and a long black dress (very angelina jolie) get on the elevator, obviously mid argument. agness' mood seems very dark today. they instantly shut up when they realize jane is in the elevator.}

<C>__{jane}
<D>__{uh, no... changed.}
<A>__{jane looks at the fertility literature in jake's hand just as jake slips it behind his back. an awful two seconds of silence, then jane notices a tattoo of a tiger on agness' back. it creeps her out. jake catches jane's reaction, then thank god the doors open. jake leans down and picks up pedro who instantly climbs up his back.}
