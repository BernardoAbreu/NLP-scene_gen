<LOC>__{1:  INT.  COMMUNITY HALL.   DAY.}
<ACTION>__{The Church of St. Peter Los Angeles. "WHOEVER YOU SEE HERE - WHATEVER YOU HEAR HERE - STAYS HERE." That's a notice on a wall. Here's another notice "NO SMOKING." Everyone is smok- ing. This is an AA meeting. There's a lot of Faces to look at. I don't know when we'll get to the one that's talking, but when we do it's like this. Eyes like glue. 50 years old with a face the color of a snuff-users hanky. He says this:}
<CHAR>__{BENNY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{.. after my third recovery my wife made me swear I'd never bring another bottle into the house.  And I never did. I bur- ied it under the lawn.  Cut out a turf & stood it upright with a piece of tin- foil instead of a cork. So here we are out in the yard, and she's happy because I'm getting healthy in a pair of swim- ing shorts & no way near no booze. She decides to prune the roses. Meanwhile, I'm laying there with a straw stuck in- to the fucken lawn doing a quart of red ..}
<ACTION>__{Curious thing about drunks. Their disease often amuses them.}
<DIAL>__{That's how crazy I was - I was sick for half a life till I finally found my san- ity again in these rooms. Don't take that drink - And for the one or two new faces I see here, I say this: just do it by the day. You gotta do it by the day - Don't take that drink. And keep coming to these meetings. Because here is where it works ..}
<CHAR>__{CHAIR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thank you, Benny .. We have a few more minutes .. Anyone else like to share? ..}
<ACTION>__{Ash into an ashtray and now a face. He's around 40 years old. Intense eyes & dark hair. Probably good looking when the ang- le's right. But this is a bad angle. His name is JOHN BERLIN.}

<DIAL>__{Hi, John.}
<CHAR>__{BERLIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I didn't intend to speak today.  Matter of fact, I wasn't gonna come to the meeting .. But I wanna say a couple of things I hope may be of use, particularly as Benny says, to the new faces here. I first came into this fellowship ten months ago. I came to a meeting I was convinced was gonna be my last - how could a buncha drunks help me? - Then someone got up, I think it was Micky, and described himself as "the shit around which the universe revolved." I don't know if that was original to him - it doesn't matter, it was the first time I'd heard it, and I still can't think of a better way to describe how I felt - We all have our own place in the darkness, and I was in such a mess I could hardly fucken see - I'd lost someone very dear to me - she hadn't died - I had - I don't know whether she left coza the drinking, or whether I drank coz I knew she was gonna leave - either way, the booze won - I replaced her with alcohol & anger - I was angry with her, myself, everyone and everything - Where I was I wanted to be someplace else - any place but here - any moment but now - But here I am, and it is now, and there's a big change about to hap- pen in my life - and I'm going for it coz this time I know I'm not running away - I'm actually two miles into a 600 mile journey, and I feel good about myself going there - So I stopped off to share that with you - and to thank everyone of you, and everyone in this fellowship for letting me walk out of here, free ..}

<ACTION>__{High above the Golden Gate. Too high for specifics. But there is something down there of interest to the Camera. Descending with the Music it seems to isolate a particular car. Too many and too distant to know which it is. But the Camera is follow- ing and already a mile up the 101 Interstate travelling north. Maybe via a dissolve. And maybe not. But red and white either way as the headlights are coming on. The Camera is closing on the highway. And a car has definitely been selected. There is nothing much of interest about it. It's a blue Mercedes sedan. Mussorgsky will choreograph the pace of these cuts. The first puts the frame directly in front of the car. In a few moments its brights snap up. And Titles continue in a dazzle of light.}
<LOC>__{3:  INT.  MERCEDES SEDAN.  101.  DUSK.}
<ACTION>__{Nobody in the car except BERLIN. And a lot of cigarette smoke. Just time to wedge in a P.O.V. There's an intersection coming up. He hits the indicators and crosses lanes winding his wind- ow down. Takes a last hit at his cigarette and exits the butt.}
<LOC>__{4:  EXT.  FREEWAY INTERSECTION.  DUSK.}
<ACTION>__{An instant of red as the cigarette shatters up the highway. A heavy sky of red and black cloud. The Mercedes turns off head- ing east. This time the Camera doesn't follow. Remains static over the intersection until the tail lights finally disappear.}
<LOC>__{5:  INT.  LIVING ROOM.  HOUSE.  DAWN.}
<ACTION>__{Bare wooden boards and the sound of singing birds. This house hasn't been lived in for years. No furniture other than a new mattress in the middle of the floor. Still in polythene wraps. BERLIN just about awake on top of it. Ten seconds of disorien- tation while he puts this together. A stone fireplace. Stairs leading to what's got to be a tiny room above. With enough ef- fort this place could be charming. But right now it's a wreck.}
<LOC>__{6:  INT.  KITCHEN.  HOUSE.  DAWN.}
<ACTION>__{This kitchen was out of date by 1963. A huge china sink and a fat fridge. But the cooker works and a battered old kettle is already on the gas. T-shirt and instant coffee. BERLIN checks cupboards out. Crockery includes a cup and that'll do for now. His lips articulate a silent expletive. The gas has just gone out. Tries to relight it without success. On hands & knees he explores a rubber supply pipe that snakes under the back door.}
<LOC>__{7:  EXT.  OPEN END GARAGE AND YARD.  HOUSE.  DAWN.}
<ACTION>__{In the garage he finds the gas cylinder.  Empty and so is the bastard with it. He drags fingers through hair in frustration. Looks around at the heaps of crap that need clearing out. The view beyond he hardly cares to look at.  But if he does it is as follows.  Clouds massing on the horizon. Fields getting re- ady for rain.  His nearest neighbor is around 200 yards away. His nearest Cow about 50. This house is remote and rural look- ing with a veranda out back. But BERLIN has no inclination for sight-seeing. As he walks away a dreary female Voice seeps in.}
<LOC>__{8:  INT.  LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN.  HOUSE.  DAWN.}
<ACTION>__{The Voice comes via a police scanner. Most of this dialogue's bullshit. Illegally parked autos and a few drunks still about. BERLIN sits on the mattress eating a breakfast of chewing gum and milk. He unwraps another Juicy Fruit and regrets it. Goes round his mouth like a shoe in a washing machine. A reluctant decision is taken. Spits gum at the sink as he arrives in the kitchen. Starts unloading his leather bag. A flotsam of stuff is excavated including a 9mm Beretta and a pack of cigarettes. He lights up and takes a cruel hit full of nicotine and guilt. Wouldn't need a clairvoyant to realize he's trying to give up. Something on the scanner interests him and he wanders back to the living room. There's a call going out for "David 72 Sam 3." David 72 acknowledges and BERLIN clearly recognizes the voice. "We have a 927D/ Springfield Street/ City Dump." But David 72 is already hired. "I'm outside Emersons/ I wanna be the first horrible face of her day." BERLIN exhales through a smile. The Controller needs an E.T.A. for the 927? David 72 doesn't know. Advises her to roll a couple of cars and "Secure the location."}

<ACTION>__{A Chevrolet zig-zags up a shabby canyon. It's the road to the city dump. Its final bend reveals a line of bellowing garbage trucks. Everything is backed up. Nothing moves except the car. The cause of the hold-up is explained at the top. A Sheriff's car blocks the road. A Uniform moves to wave the Chevrolet in.}
<LOC>__{10:  EXT.  ENTRANCE/TRACK/INFILL.  CITY DUMP.  EUREKA.  DAY.}
<ACTION>__{The car parks at a weigh-house and a man in his 50's gets out. Looks like he hasn't slept in a while. And got the mood to go with it. Sports jacket and cowboy boots. A lot of laugh lines around the eyes. But you wouldn't want to get arrested by him. And especially not this morning. His name is FREDERICK T ROSS.}

Screeches out onto the highway and the Camera begins to ascend. The Camera climbs higher revealing somber mountains. Plus mile upon mile of road he has yet to travel. Still it ascends until the Chevrolet is reduced to an insignificance by the landscape.}

She's already at the swing doors and he's virtually running to stay with her. She bursts through the doors and rushes downstairs. He follows only seconds behind. The wind groans down as they descend. HEL- ENA turns a corner of the stairwell and momentarily disappears. For a moment he loses her! Which way did she go? Downstairs or along the corridor? His anxiety is immediately assuaged. Spots what already looks like a ghost fleeing into shadows. He takes off along the corridor. Getting breathless. But getting closer. Near enough now to sense her fear. Near enough now to grab her.}

And for an in- stant neither does MARGIE. Their surprise is mutually stunning. How can it be him? How can it be her? TAYLOR's still trying to work out how they made the switch when the first bullet smacks into his chest. Gets another as he goes down. He crumples in a deadly heap and revenge is completed with two more in the back.}

<ACTION>__{MARGIE barges through the doors. The MYOPIC Janitor is halfway up adjacent stairs peering down. No time for introductions and no time for explanations. "Call the Police. Do it. Now." Shout- ing up at him she's already descending. "Tell em the gymnasium."}

<ACTION>__{MARGIE patrols plate glass windows. Where are the fucking cops? She's shocked and looks strange indeed. Wig off but hair grips all over her head. An overcoat and shoes but still wearing the nightgown underneath. A couple of dreary lights in the ceiling. HELENA sits numb under one of them all but hidden in a blanket. MARGIE can't stand waiting any longer. "I'm gonna call them my- self." HELENA nods and sure she's Ok. to stay here. The doors settle and she is alone. Headlights cross the windows shifting the shadows of everything. Swooping the walls they move attent- ion back to the door. TAYLOR stares in and then pushes through. Worse for wear but very much alive. Discarded his leather jack- et revealing the bullet proof vest. Blood all over his T-shirt. Looks like he caught one in the shoulder. A bad burn and blood runs from his left hand. In his right hand he clasps the knife. He cracks it open like a whip. HELENA hears it and stands. Ter- ror as the footsteps approach. "Margie. Margie." But Margie is- n't around. He's less than 30 feet away. She tries to back off but is hindered by the blanket. Tries to scream but is stifled with fear. Maybe six seconds to live but this refers to Taylor. "Taylor" He swings around but this time he doesn't get time to look surprised. BERLIN blows the fucker across the room. Solid load slugs weighing an ounce each crash into him. BERLIN keeps pumping the Remington and doesn't stop firing until the magaz- ine is over. No conjecture now. This bastard is very much dead. BERLIN throws the 12 gauge aside. And maybe it means something. Maybe at last he accepts he's stopped living in that world and ready to give himself a chance in this. HELENA in his arms and this is his new world. Flashing lights and headlights flood in- to the darkness. Their embrace goes on. And this story is told.}
