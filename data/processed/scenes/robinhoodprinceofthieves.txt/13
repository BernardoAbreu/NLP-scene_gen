<L>__{exterior english shore day}
<A>__{a twelfth century french sailboat at anchor. a cross on its sail. a longboat rows to shore. robin stands in the prow, in a pilgrim's hooded robe. he gazes at the approaching land. unable to wait, he leaps into the surf and wades to the beach. he kneels, pressing his hands and face into the soil.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{home. thank you, lord.}
<A>__{aslan steps from the boat, sniffing the air. the french sailors keep their distance from him. robin takes his hand.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{my friend, you have escorted me home. i beg you to free yourself of your vow. return with the boat. i know how heavy your heart must be, this far from your family and native land...}
<C>__{aslan }
<D>__{because i love them so dearly, i cannot dishonor them.}
<A>__{a sailor creeps up behind aslan, club in hand.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i thought you'd say that.}
<A>__{he nods to the sailor, who swings the club down. the saracen sidesteps, grabs the man's arm and flips him into the surf. he turns a cold stare on robin.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{no man controls my destiny. especially not one who attacks downwind and stinks of garlic.}
<A>__{robin laughs. the saracen remains intense.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{if our positions were reversed, i would have done the same. only i would have succeeded.}
<A>__{he smiles broadly. robin claps him on the shoulder.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{come, aslan. by nightfall we will celebrate your honor when we dine with my father.}
