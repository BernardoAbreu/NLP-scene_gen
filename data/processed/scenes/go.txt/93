<L>__{interior private room night}
<A>__{a mirrored ball spins overhead, stars racing across the black paneling. holly nudges simon into his chair. he and marcus sit back to back. as the champage pops, we move into a series of overlapping shots: noelle licks the foam from holly's fingers. holly rubs the bottle against herself, pours. noelle and holly dance together, a tinsel ribbon around them. simon adjusts himself in the crotch. noelle lights a cigar for marcus as holly dances alone. holly lifts her miniskirt to reveal a g string. simon cranes his neck back, banging heads with marcus. noelle takes a puff off the cigar. holly straddles simon, rubs against him. he shudders. his hands start to rise. she gently pushes them back down. marcus whispers something to noelle. noelle comes up behind holly, moving with her as she rubs against simon. marcus turns to watch. enraptured, simon watches the four armed woman on top of him. his fingers start to twitch. noelle kisses the edge of holly's neck. simon's hands rise, reach... holly moans... and suddenly... simon grabs noelle's ass. it's heaven.}

<A>__{for a beat, no one's sure what happened. we look around to marcus. vic jr. holly. noelle. then finally simon. he just fired. the gun is steady in his hand. marcus checks his shirt. a spray of blood. vic jr. checks his arm. it's bleeding. we hold for a moment, the mirrored ball still spinning overhead.}

<D>__{behind you.}
<A>__{a fire escape door. simon motions for marcus to come. pushing the bar, no alarm sounds. they back out, into the night. the door swings shut. a beat. suddenly, an man charges in with a silver .45. he is vic sr.,}
