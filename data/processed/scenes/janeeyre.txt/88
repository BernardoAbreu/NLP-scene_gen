<L>__{interior night. thornfield the third floor.}
<A>__{rochester stops by a low door. he puts a key in the lock.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{be steady. i need you.}
<A>__{he unlocks it. a room hung with tapestries; a four poster bed with its curtains half drawn. one part of the tapestry is hooked up over a hidden door which lies open to an inner chamber. a dull, sickly light shines out.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{wait.}
<A>__{he goes to the inner chamber. a grim laugh greets him.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{thank you, mrs poole.}
<A>__{he locks the door. jane shudders. he goes to the bed.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{here. bring the candle.}
<A>__{jane obeys. richard mason is lying, one arm and all the linen soaked in blood. jane controls her reaction and makes herself useful. rochester is cleaning the wound.}
<C>__{mason}
<D>__{am i dying?}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{mason}
<D>__{she bit me while the knife was in bit me }
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{it was folly to attempt the interview tonight and alone.}
<C>__{mason}
<D>__{i thought i might have done some good.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{it makes me impatient to hear you.}
<C>__{mason}
<D>__{she sucked the blood. said she'd drain me like a vampire }
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{think of her as dead, dead and buried. say nothing!}
<A>__{mason is silenced. rochester puts the bloody sponge into jane's hand.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{i am going for a doctor. i must leave you here with him. sponge the blood away when it returns. give him water if he wants it. do not speak to him for any reason. and richard on pain of death do not speak to her.}
<A>__{rochester takes the candelabra. he is gone. mason is staring at jane. there is something about the pupils in his eyes that she finds deadly, chilling. she dips the sponge in the bloody water and wipes away the trickling gore. she hears a low moan. she looks over at the door to the inner chamber, aching to know the mystery behind it. mason makes her start by taking her wrist. he is trying to say something. jane puts her finger to her lips. she is begging him not to speak.}
