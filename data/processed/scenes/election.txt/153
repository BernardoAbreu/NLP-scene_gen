<D>__{dear god, thank you for all your blessings. you have given me so many things, like good health, nice parents, a nice truck, and what i've been told is a large penis, and i'm very grateful. but i sure am worried about tammy. in my heart i still can't believe she tore down my posters, but sometimes she does get so weird and angry. please help her be a happier person, because she's so smart and sensitive, and i love her. also, i'm nervous about the election tomorrow, and i guess i want to win and all, but i know that's totally up to you. you'll decide who the best person is, and i will accept it. and forgive my sins, whatever they may be. amen.}
