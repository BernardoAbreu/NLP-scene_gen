<D>__{let's change topics for a moment. does anybody have a viewpoint on something going on now called "ed tv". panel member #1 this, i believe, is a new low point in american culture. panel member #2 i agree. what it reveals is the absolute creative bankruptcy in the television business. what they're saying, basically, is "we're giving up. we have no ideas." panel member #3 it's worse than that! they don't select someone with any talent, or with something to say they seem to celebrate the fact that this guy is a boob. it's a joyous celebration of boobery. panel member #4 i think we've already spent far too much time discussing this.}
