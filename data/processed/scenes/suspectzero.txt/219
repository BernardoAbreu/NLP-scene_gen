<A>__{ interior morgue same fran is at a phone, in the morgue. the logan utah body lies on the table.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{it's not a burn. it's a freezer burn.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{you're sure.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{there's crystallization in the blood stream. the blood never clotted in the wound. it's a freezer burn... i'm having the other body shipped out the guy from trenton. we'll see if he's got the same thing.}
<A>__{mackelway pauses, thinking...}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{so... he keeps the bodies in a freezer, then buries them...?}
<A>__{that was a question. he can't do any better.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{i dunno. if he kept them in a freezer they'd have marks like this all over. wouldn't they?}
<A>__{mackelway nods that made sense. shit. the noise of the interstate doesn't make things any easier. a huge truck rumbles by. 18 wheels. mackelway eyes it, absently. then a bolt hits him: on the side of the truck is a trademark: "ever frost." this truck is hauling ice cream. things just began to click.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{thanks, fran.}
<A>__{he has hit "end" before she can reply. heads to his yukon. fran eyes the phone: that was odd...}
