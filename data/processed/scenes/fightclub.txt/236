<C>__{marla}
<D>__{you are the worst thing that ever happened to me.}
<A>__{doors hiss shut. the bus leaves, heading away. jack seems relieved. then, a scream is heard from marla... jack turns, looks... through the bus windows: the bus is filled with bald men in black: space monkeys. jack sprints after the bus... the bus speeds away. onboard, space monkeys subdue marla. jack falls to the asphalt, rolls, files flying.}
