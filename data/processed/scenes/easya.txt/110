<L>__{interior olive's bedroom night}
<A>__{olive cries on her bed, clutching her teddy bear. rosemary listens, as a good mother does.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{so, now everyone who knows the truth is either gone or won't fess up. the cross your legs club is demanding my head. and the messed up thing is that i wouldn't put it past gibbons to expel me.}
<C>__{rosemary}
<D>__{i had a similar situation when i was your age.}
<C>__{olive}
<P>__{(in disbelief)}
<D>__{everyone called you a whore?}
<C>__{rosemary}
<D>__{yes. i had a horrible reputation and people said awful things about me. but it was true. i was a slut.}
<A>__{olive gives her a suspicious look.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{i'm waiting for you to say}
<P>__{(imitating her mother)}
<D>__{`just kidding!'}
<C>__{rosemary}
<P>__{(earnestly)}
<D>__{no, it's true. i slept with a whole bunch of people.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{mom!}
<C>__{rosemary}
<D>__{well! it was a different time.}
<C>__{olive}
<A>__{ewwww!}
<C>__{rosemary}
<A>__{i did. i got around. before i met your father, i was a garden variety floozy.}
<C>__{olive}
<A>__{why are you telling me this?}
<C>__{rosemary}
<A>__{because i endured a similar lynching because of a certain dalliance.}
<C>__{olive}
<A>__{i promise that it was no worse than marianne bryant's attack on me.}
<C>__{rosemary}
<A>__{wanna bet? it was her mother.}
<C>__{olive}
<A>__{wait, what?}
<C>__{rosemary}
<A>__{yep. don bryant and i got caught in a very compromising position in the locker room during a basketball game.}
<C>__{olive}
<A>__{that's disgusting! he's disgusting!}
<C>__{rosemary}
<A>__{he wasn't back then. he was actually pretty handsome. all i'm saying is that maybe the reason that bryant girl is going after you is because her mother told her about me.}
<C>__{olive}
<A>__{so, the sins of the mother are revisited on the daughter.}
<C>__{rosemary}
<A>__{there's something else you should know. this is hard to say but don bryant is your father. marianne is your sister. olive turns white.}
<C>__{rosemary }
<D>__{kidding!! well, about the sister thing, but not about the don thing. that happened. actually that happened a couple of times before we got caught.}
<A>__{olive punches her mother on the arm, who's laughing hysterically.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{i hate you so much right now. can't you see i'm a mess!}
<C>__{rosemary}
<D>__{no, you're not, olive. you're wonderful. and you're going to handle this the same way that i did. with an incontrovertible sense of humor.}
<A>__{they embrace and olive gets an idea.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{thanks for the pep talk, mom. now get out. i need to make some phone calls.}
<A>__{rosemary looks slightly concerned by the grin on olive's face.}
