<L>__{interior parlor car (process)}
<A>__{the brogues come to rest before a chair as the owner sits down. a moment later the sport shoes come to rest. before in adjoining chair. the legs belonging to the sport shoes stretch out, and one of the shoes touches one of the brogues.}
<C>__{man's voice }
<D>__{oh, excuse me!}
<A>__{camera pulls back and up to show two young men seated in two parlor car chairs. brun0 anthony, the wearer of the sport shoes, is about twenty five. he wears his expensive clothes with the tweedy nonchalance of a young man who has always had the best. the wearer of the brogues is a fine looking but, at the moment, a somewhat troubled young man. this is guy haines. he, too, is in his middle twenties and is well dressed because he can now afford to be. he nods politely, acknowledging bruno's apology, then turns away with the gesture implying he wants privacy.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(smiling with sudden recognition)}
<D>__{i beg your pardon, but aren't you guy haines.}
<A>__{guy nods with a polite half smile. being a well known tournament tennis player, he has had this sort of experience before.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(snapping his finger)}
<D>__{sure! i saw you blast faraday right off the court in south orange last season. what a backhand! made the semi finals, didn't you?}
<A>__{guy acknowledges this with a modest nod and turns to his magazine rolled up in is fist.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(with open admiration)}
<D>__{i certainly admire people who do things.}
<P>__{(smiling and introducing himself)}
<D>__{i'm bruno anthony. bruno. see guy looks up. bruno indicates his gold tie pin which bears his name in cut out letters. guy looks at it with the faintest expression of disdain. i suppose you think it's corny. but my mother gave it to me so of course i wear it to please her.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(patiently)(a faint smile)}
<D>__{how do you do.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(with an apologetic grin)}
<D>__{i don't usually talk so much. go ahead and read.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(wryly)}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{guy tries to read but is uneasily aware of bruno's open appraisal.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{it must be pretty exciting to be so important.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(fidgeting slightly)}
<D>__{a tennis player isn't so important.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{people who do things are important. i never seem to do anything.}
<A>__{not knowing how to answer this, guy looks a little embarrassed.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(still insistent on being friendly)}
<D>__{i suppose you're going to southampton for the doubles.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(politely)}
<D>__{you are a tennis fan.}
<A>__{bruno is inordinately pleased by this small tribute.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{wish i could see you play. but i've got to be back in washington tomorrow. i live in arlington, you know.}
<A>__{he has taken out a cigarette case. holds it out to guy.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{cigarette?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{not now, thanks. i don't smoke much.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{i smoke too much.}
<A>__{he fumbles for a match. guy brings out a lighter and hands it to bruno.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{thanks.}
<P>__{(he stares at the lighter, impressed)}
<D>__{elegant.}
<B>__{close shot of the lighter}
<A>__{showing that it has the insignia of crossed rackets embossed on it, and underneath is engraved the inscription: "to g from a".}
<C>__{bruno's voice}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{to g from a. bet i can guess who a is.}
<B>__{wider shot}
<A>__{guy reacts sharply.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{anne burton. sometimes i turn the sport page and look at the society news. and the pictures. she's very beautiful, senator burton's daughter.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{you're quite a reader, mr. anthony.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{yes, i am. ask me anything, from today's stock reports to li'l abner, and i got the answer.}
<C>__{bruno }
<D>__{even news about people i don't know. like who'd like to marry whom when his wife gets her divorce.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{perhaps you read too much.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(contritely)}
<D>__{there i go again. too friendly. i meet someone i' like and open my yap too wide. i'm sorry...}
<A>__{at the appeal on bruno's face, guy slowly relents.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{that's all right. forget it. i guess i'm pretty jumpy.}
<A>__{bruno smiles with and signals a waiter.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{there's a new cure for that.}
<P>__{(to waiter)}
<D>__{scotch and plain water. a pair. double.}
<P>__{(to guy with a chuckle)}
<D>__{only kind of doubles i play.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{you'll have to drink both of them.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{and i can do it.}
<P>__{(moving in)}
<D>__{when's the wedding?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{the wedding. you and anne burton.}
<P>__{(a gesture of explanation)}
<D>__{it was in the papers.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{it shouldn't have been. unless they've legalized bigamy overnight.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{i have a theory about that. i'd like to tell you about it some time. but right now i suppose divorce is still the simplest operation.}
<A>__{the waiter has brought the drinks. bruno slips the lighter into hip pocket to free his hands for the bills which he gives to the waiter, waving away the change. he offers a glass to guy. guy takes it.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(as if he needs it)}
<D>__{i guess i will.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(happily)}
<D>__{this is wonderful having your company all the way to new york.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(forced to explain)}
<D>__{as a matter of fact, i'm not going direct. i'm stopping off. at metcalf.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{metcalf? what would anybody want to go there for?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{it's my home town.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{oh, i get it! a little talk with your wife to about the divorce! i suppose she was the girl next door. held her hand in high school and before you knew it hooked!}
<P>__{(proud of his perspicacity)}
<D>__{am i right?}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(laconically)}
<D>__{close enough.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(raises his glass)}
<D>__{well, here's luck, guy. drink up then we'll have some lunch sent to my compartment.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{thanks very much. but i think i will go to the dining car.}
<P>__{(he hails a waiter}
<D>__{who is passing through with a food laden}
<P>__{tray)}
<D>__{do you know if there are any vacant seats in the dining car now?}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{not for about twenty minutes i'm afraid, sir.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(pleased)}
<D>__{see? you'll have to lunch with me.}
<P>__{(motions the waiter back)}
<D>__{say, waiter, bring me some lamb chops and french fries and chocolate ice cream, compartment d, car 121.}
<P>__{(turns to guy)}
<D>__{what'll you have, guy?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{thanks just the same, but i really don't think }
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{oh, go on and order.}
<A>__{the waiter is hovering impatiently. guy gives in out of embarrassment.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{well, i will just have a hamburger and a cup of coffee.}

<P>__{(delighted, lifts his}
<D>__{glass in another}
