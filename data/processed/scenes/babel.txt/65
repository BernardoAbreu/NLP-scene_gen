<D>__{here... here...}
<L>__{interior room, anwar's house day}
<D>__{an old woman (87), anwar's grandmother, who has centuries of desert in her expression, lets them in and points at a rug on the floor.}
<C>__{anwar's grandmother}
<P>__{(in arabic)}
<D>__{put her there... richard understands and softly lays susan on the rug. susan looks around horrified: adobe walls, dirt floor: the epitome of the third world.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{i need to call an ambulance and contact my embassy.}
<C>__{anwar}
<D>__{if you have the number of the embassy, i can go call. obviously, richard does not have it.}

<D>__{don't leave me here alone...}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{don't worry, i will be right back. susan looks desperate. to set richard somewhat at ease, anwar points at his grandmother.}
<C>__{anwar}
<D>__{she can take care of her. richard leans over susan.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{you're going to be ok. anwar kneels down next to her, takes a cloth and improvises a tourniquet that he adjusts near her shoulder. he turns towards the grandmother.}
<C>__{anwar}
<P>__{(in arabic)}
<D>__{hold and release the tourniquet every once in a while. the grandmother nods. she sees the swarm of kids looking into the place and she shoos them away.}
<C>__{anwar's grandmother}
<P>__{(in arabic)}
<D>__{get out of here... out... the kids obey, except for one or two who take one last look before they go. susan's terrified eyes watch anwar and richard leave the room.}
