<D>__{hello, ned. can we talk?}
<A>__{racine swivels in his chair so that he can see beverly in the reception room. beverly is just replacing the receiver on the hook and for a moment, she gives racine a strange, ambivalent look. racine watches her as she goes back to work and speaks quietly into the phone. converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
