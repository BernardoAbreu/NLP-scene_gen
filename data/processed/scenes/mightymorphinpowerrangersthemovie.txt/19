<L>__{exterior inner city construction site night}
<A>__{barricades and police tape surround the egg. a security guard passes his sleeping co worker, drops into a chair, sips his coffee. bzzwapp zedd, rita, goldar and a short, fat, furry creature named mordant appear.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{another saturday night and i'm traipsing around the galaxy with the three little pigs! my mother warned me this would happen! rita, she said, after 89 marriages you might wanna think about throwing in the towel. why didn't i listen to her?!}
<A>__{zedd grumbles to himself.}

<A>__{kurt looks up groggily.}
<C>__{zedd}
<D>__{no need to wake him. in fact, why don't you take a little nap yourself.}
<A>__{zedd zaps the guys with a bolt from his staff they are knocked out. goldar steps back from the blast and accidentally steps or mordant's foot. mordant knocks on goldar's metallic leg.}
<C>__{mordant}
<D>__{hey bonehead, get off my hoof!}
<A>__{goldar is oblivious. zedd, stands reverently before the glowing egg shape.}

<D>__{mordant's my second cousin three times removed on my mother's side. he`s just visiting for the summer.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{well put a muzzle on him!}
<A>__{mordant grumbles under his breath. meanwhile, zedd aims is staff at the chamber and bursts a blast of energy. the egg opens up with a whoosh of decompressing air. webs of electricity branch out, followed by a swirl of black smoke. when the smoke clears we see a bubbling, purple, phosphoscent ooze. the group gathers around rita sticks a finger in o the sticky substance.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{what... you spent two thousand years looking for this tub of snot!}
<A>__{as if in response, the ooze boils and froths. zedd and rita are too busy arguing to notice this.}
<C>__{zedd}
<D>__{don't you ever have anything nice to say?!}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{well, if i did i certainly wouldn't say it to you!}
<A>__{we hear a slithering slurping sound as the substance rises up and takes on the ghastly shape of ivan ooze. mordant tugs at zedd.}
<C>__{mordant}
<D>__{boss.}
<C>__{zedd}
<D>__{for your information this is not just your average, run of the mill tub of snot !}

<C>__{mordant}
<D>__{boss.}
<C>__{zedd}
<D>__{what!}
<A>__{zedd and rita finally notice ivan, standing with his lips apart, revealing jagged teeth, one of which is made of}
<B>__{glistening silver.}
<A>__{he stretches his sinewy arms, releases an enormous yawn, puts his hands on his head, cracks it.}
<C>__{ivan}
<D>__{ahhhhhhhh.}
<A>__{now he smacks his lips together, opens his arms theatrically and gives his trademark stance.}
<C>__{ivan}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen... the ooze is back!!}
<A>__{rita blushes.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{he's so cute.}
<A>__{zedd flashes her an angry look, turns back to ivan.}
<C>__{zedd}

<A>__{ivan gives a slight bow.}
<C>__{ivan}
<D>__{how can i ever repay you?}
<C>__{zedd}
<D>__{do you recall the name... zordon of eltare?}
<A>__{ivan's face goes dark, thunder rumbles and the site lights up with a flash of lightning. mordant turns to goldar.}
<C>__{mordant}
<D>__{seems to ring a bell.}
<C>__{zedd}
<D>__{i want you to destroy zordon, so that my evil may once again reign supreme.}
<C>__{ivan }
<D>__{i will not only destroy him, i will obliterate his entire being. it will be like zordon of eltare never existed!}

<C>__{ivan }
<D>__{"... left off interstate 12?!"}
