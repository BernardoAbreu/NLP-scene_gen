<L>__{interior cell}
<A>__{sarah looks up as the cell door opens. douglas walks in slowly, idly tapping his police baton against the door in a ominous rhythm. the other two orderlies ease in behind him. one of them carries a stun baton (like a sawed off cattle prod). the other has a tray with cups of red liquid thorazine.}
<C>__{douglas}
<D>__{time to take you meds, connor.}
<A>__{sarah faces him, weight centered. feral eyes darting from one to the other.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{you take it.}
<A>__{douglas grins, casual }
<C>__{douglas}
<D>__{now you know you got to be good 'cause you up for review this afternoon...}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i'm not taking it. now i don't want any trouble...}
<C>__{douglas}
<D>__{ain't no trouble at all }
<A>__{he whips the baton in a whistling backhand, which whap! takes her square in the stomach. she doubles over and drops to her knees, unable to breathe. douglas tips the bed and it slams down with a crash, right new to her. he takes her stun wand from the other attendant and walks forward. tight on sarah, grimacing and struggling to breathe.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{you... son of a... aaarrgh!!}
<A>__{the stun wand hits her between shoulder blades as she tries to rise. it drives her to the floor, pinning her like a bug. little electric arcs crackle as the baton makes her writhe in pain. douglas grabs her by the hair and jerks her up to her knees. holds the cup of thorazine in front of her lips.}
<C>__{douglas}
<D>__{last call, sugar.}
<A>__{gasping, she chokes the zombie juice down.}
