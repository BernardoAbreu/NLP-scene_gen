<D>__{our first annual report, must be thirty five years ago now, i owned two stations, i wrote down a state ment of purpose, that one day you would wake up to a parrish radio station, read a parrish paper at breakfast, catch our news on tele vision during the day, and go to bed with one of our books or magazines and you would always be told the truth and in the bargain, have a good time.}
