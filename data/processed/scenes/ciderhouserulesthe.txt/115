<L>__{interior bunkhouse late at night}
<A>__{homer lies awake in bed; everyone else is asleep. homer pulls the package out from under his bed, opening it just enough to see what it is; then he shoves it back under his bed.}
<L>__{exterior ocean beach dusk}
<A>__{the beach at sunset. candy and homer, dressed for cooler weather, are alone at the water's edge. from a paper bag, candy is scattering some small, brightly colored pieces of broken glass.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{nobody will swim here until next summer. by then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand there won't be any sharp edges.}
<A>__{she finds and old piece of glass among the stones and shells at the high tide mark.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{see? that's last year's glass, or from some year before. i put glass here every year. the ocean makes it beautiful.}
<A>__{candy holds up a piece of glass to the sun for homer to look at. the ocean is a gray green color, the glass a paler shade of green.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{give me your hand.}
<A>__{she rubs the smooth piece of glass against his hand, then throws it toward the water. it falls short. homer retrieves it. candy splashes him playfully. he chases her away from the beach, into the pine trees. homer locks his arms around her, from behind. he can't let go. she lets him hold her, then breaks his grip. she turns to face him. she is taller then he is, older, obviously more experienced. she initiates the kiss. they drop to the ground right there; they make love by the roots of the tree, candy guiding him.}
