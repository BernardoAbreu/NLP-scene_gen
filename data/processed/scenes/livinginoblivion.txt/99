<L>__{interior the set. day}
<A>__{nick paces tensely in front of nicole and tito.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{look, tito. it's not that big a deal. it's a dream, alright. strange things happen in a dream. all you have to do is laugh. why is that such a problem?}
<C>__{tito}
<D>__{why does it have to be a dwarf?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{tito}
<D>__{why does my character have to be a dwarf?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{he doesn't have to be a dwarf.}
<C>__{tito}
<D>__{then why is he?! is that the only way you can make this a dream; put a dwarf in it?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{no, tito; that's not }
<C>__{tito}
<D>__{have you ever had a dream with a dwarf in it?! do you know anyone who's had a dream with a dwarf in it? no! i don't even have dreams with dwarves in them! the only place i've seen dwarves in dreams is in stupid movies like this! make it weird; put a dwarf in it. everyone will go "whoa whoa whoa, must be a dream, there's a fucking dwarf in it!" well, i'm sick of it. you can take this dream sequence and shove it up your ass!}
<A>__{tito hurls his top hat and gloves to the floor and walks out. everyone stares at nick who is frozen in stunned silence. finally wanda approaches him hesitantly.}
<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{nick?}
<P>__{(no response)}
<D>__{i can get right on the phone. we'll try to get another... small person here as soon as possible.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{no. he's absolutely right.}
<A>__{nick sighs heavily and sinks to sit on the dolly in silence. wolf appears behind him, still wiping his eyes.}
<C>__{wolf}
<D>__{you want to just shoot ellen, nick? she could be in the dream by herself.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{no. we're not going to shoot anything. i'm sorry. thanks for all your help, but it's over. i can't take it anymore. i tried to roll with it but it's time to face the music; i can't do this. i am not a director. the shoot is over. i give up.}
<A>__{nick's speech has the simple eloquence of truth; he is not bitter or self pitying. he seems unaware of how disturbing this is to the crew. they all stand around him in shock, afraid to move or speak. finally wolf turns to the ac and puts his hand on his shoulder, like a father to his young son.}
<C>__{wolf}
<D>__{take the camera off the dolly. start putting it away.}
<A>__{everyone watches the ac unfasten the camera in silence. nicole stands alone on the set in her wedding dress, still holding the golden apple. her face is frozen in dismay. suddenly cora comes through the set door and marches up to nicole.}
<C>__{cora}
<D>__{give me that apple!}
<A>__{at the sound of his mother's voice, nick looks up. he sees her snatch the apple from nicole's hand and march back out the door, closing it behind her.}
<C>__{cora}
<P>__{(behind the door)}
<D>__{i'm ready, nick!}
