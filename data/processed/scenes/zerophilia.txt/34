<L>__{exterior road rage garage late afternoon}
<A>__{max slides out from under an old car. seeing luca, he hardens, wiping his greasy hands on a rag.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{i know she doesn't want to talk to me. but do you know where i can find her?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{new york. left two days ago.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{oh, man. ...you're staying?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{just 'til friday.}
<A>__{max returns to his work.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{i wanted to apologize to her. forget it, i don't know,... obviously, nothing's gonna' ever be with me and her, but i just wish she knew how much i, and that i wasn't cheating, i was just trying to be a man for her.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{she'd have a field day with that one, huh?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{true.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{if you talk to her, please just tell her, i'm sorry, and i wish her the best,... everything.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{luca 'nods', not fully understanding max's response.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{i'm sorry. to you too.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{mixed signals, i guess.}
<A>__{max walks toward the back, then yelps, wincing.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{ow! son of a bitch!}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{you all right?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{stepped on a nail. damn it!}
<A>__{max sits on a crate, starts untying his boot.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{so, you gettin' used to this at all?}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{i wish.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you definitely had me confused.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{for whatever it's worth. i think you're a pretty hot guy.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{thanks. but you're not interested?}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{truth is, i am. and i guess it sounds crazy, but i couldn't do that to michelle.}
<A>__{luca moves off, as max removes his boot, and his sock.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{for whatever it's worth, i think you're pretty hot too.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{too bad you're a moron.}
<C>__{luca}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i have incontrovertible proof.}
<A>__{luca stares at max, and then down at his ankle, at the tattoo}
<B>__{of a green bird.}
<A>__{max meets her eyes, and it finally dawns on luca, standing, in shock, and now putting it all together, she lunges for him, nailing him to the ground, kissing him. she rips max's t shirt as they fall to the asphalt, knocking over oil cans. passion. unbridled.}
<B>__{in the parts yard}
<A>__{luca manhandles max, shoving him against a pile of huge tires, as max's face transforms...}
<B>__{by old radiators}
<A>__{michelle slams back onto the crabgrass. she pulls luca toward her as luca's face transforms into luke.}
<B>__{by discarded truck chassis}
<A>__{luke and michelle roll on the crabgrass, kissing, transforming as they roll, into luca and max and michelle and luke and luca or was that max?}
