<L>__{interior close on storm}
<A>__{doesn't need to see to recognize that sound. he gropes at once for the wall corner, trying to propel his litter back through the swinging doors and out of sight. storm strains for it, his limbs maddeningly uncooperative ... stretching, pawing ... until he claws far enough to reach where the janitor's mop rests against the wall. coma ward hallway ford steps into the hallway, peering up and down just as storm slides out of view. the killer grabs danny's body by the ankles, to drag it back out of sight. just then:}
<B>__{andy}
<A>__{backs through the double doors at the other end of the hall, trying to balance an overloaded tray of supplies she's carrying. she and ford are momentarily in full view of each other ... but backs turned. suddenly ford hears andy! he spins ... gun ready. andy carefully heads that way the two corpses visible ahead and the killer poised to waste her. but she's concentrating on the overloaded tray, traveling closer ... closer ... until she turns off into the medicine room. ford swiftly hauls both corpses out of sight.}
<B>__{at elevators}
<A>__{storm weakly, awkwardly "rows" himself toward the elevators with the mop handle. then using his hands, trying to grasp the wall and push himself along. he makes it within reach of the call button and stabs at it with the mop handle. misses. again. then: bull's eye! the light comes on!}
