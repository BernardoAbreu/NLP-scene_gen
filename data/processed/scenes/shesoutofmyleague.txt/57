<L>__{exterior kirk's parents' home evening}
<A>__{molly drives up and stops in front of a small home on a quaint residential street. she climbs out of her car, checking the address on a small sheet of paper. she sees kirk sitting on the front porch.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{you found it!}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i had good directions!}
<A>__{she steps up the front walk toward kirk, who points to a little yellow note taped to the front door.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i'm sorry. my folks aren't back yet. we're locked out.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{you don't have a key?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{no. my dad's kind of obsessed with home security. like someone's going to break in and steal his reader's digest collection.}
<A>__{a very old man wobbles out of the house next door with a beagle on a leash. the man struggles a bit with the dog.}
<C>__{kirk }
<D>__{hi, mr. riley!}
<C>__{mr. riley}
<D>__{well, howdy kirk!}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{hey, what do say you take the night off and i will take noodle around the block for you? (to molly) are you up for a walk?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{that sounds great.}
<C>__{mr. riley}
<D>__{geeze kirk, that's mighty nice.}
<A>__{kirk jogs over to take the leash. noodle jumps up on kirk. he and molly pet the excited dog.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(baby talk)}
<D>__{yes! always happy to see you, pretty girl! yes you are a pretty girl! yes you are!}
<A>__{molly takes note animal lover big points.}
<C>__{mr. riley}
<D>__{you're a good boy, kirk.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{it's no trouble at all.}
<A>__{molly and kirk start down the sidewalk with noodle. an old woman comes out of the next house with her dog on a leash.}
<C>__{old woman}
<D>__{honey!? are you back in business!?}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(to molly)}
<D>__{i had a little neighborhood dog walking service when i was a kid .}
<P>__{(to the woman) no problem, mrs. d,}
<D>__{we can take norton along too!}
<A>__{several soft faded cuts as kirk and molly move through the neighborhood. soon they have a third dog. kirk points out landmarks as they talk and laugh. now they have a fourth dog. molly takes his arm. the evening light is a bit dimmer as they give noodle back to mr. riley. kirk turns toward his parents' house. now there's a car parked in the driveway and a jacked up, knobby tired pick up parked out front. the truck has two bumper stickers ("one nation under god!" and "no fat chicks!") flanking a vanity license plate that reads, "erix toy." kirk's shoulders slump at the sight of it.}
<C>__{kirk }
<D>__{hey, you know what i'm thinking, let's go get chinese.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{what are you talking about? i want to meet your family.}

<C>__{molly }
