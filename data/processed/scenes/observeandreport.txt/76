<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{i can see that. listen, i don't really know how to say this, but we're not going to be able to let you join the academy.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{what?! why not?}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{it seems you had a little trouble passing the minimum requirements.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{did i fail one of the tests?}

<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{we sure do. look, i tried to talk to them, but there's no way they're gonna let you in. i'm sorry, but your dreams of becoming a police officer just aren't going to happen.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i understand. thanks for believing in me, detective. and just for the record, i'm not crazy.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{take care, ronnie.}
<A>__{detective harrison goes inside and closes the doors on ronnie. ronnie stands outside of the closed academy by himself. the camera pushes into ronnie and spins upside down.}
