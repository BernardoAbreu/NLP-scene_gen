<L>__{exterior science center night}
<A>__{the big beams start cutting out one by one. the center begins to pitch and yaw. the choppers are getting closer.}
<L>__{interior control room night}
<A>__{the countdown clock reads, "00:00:15" as spidey and liz continue to pull wires and cables. two waldos erupt through the floor and grab spidey. they pull spidey to the floor. entangled in these molybdimum pythons, spidey struggles valiantly. liz leaps to his aid.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{oh my god...}
<A>__{a third waldo, a broken one, snakes up from the hole and begins feeling blindly around on the console for the power}
<B>__{throttle.}
<D>__{spider man the power!}
<A>__{liz sees the damaged waldos heading for the red throttle. the countdown clock is at "00:00:10". liz leaps and tries to wrestle it away. it whips in her arms and she holds on tight. it bangs her against the wall and then the console. she holds on. "00:00:03". the waldo crashes liz against the wall which erupts in sparks. she lets go of it. it heads for the power throttle! "00:00:01!" spider man can't break the grip of the waldos, but he can pull with super human strength. he yanks ock up through the stone floor. ock hits the ceiling of the control room. one waldo grabs on. the other one throws the red power throttle!}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{spider man. you're end is coming. life in its present form is ending... new dimensions, new horizons...}
<A>__{the universal bullet begins to glow. the glow sharpens to a point of light. spider man holds on tight against a rushing energy flow that's pulling everything in the room towards the point of light.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(bracing against the storm)}
<D>__{what is happening? spider man}
<P>__{(similarly braced)}
<D>__{i don't know!!!}
<A>__{liz starts to slip away into the flow. she struggles against it.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{i can't... hold on!}
<A>__{spidey thwips her and she grabs onto the web.}
<D>__{spider man hold tight, liz, hold tight!}
<A>__{ock drops calmly, beatifically, to the floor of the room. he moves slowly, under his own power, into the light.}
<C>__{ock}
<P>__{(spaced out)}
<D>__{you cut my power... there's too little power... it's so tiny... so tiny... there's only space... for me. but i've done it, spider man. i have broken through... i've broken through!}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{don't do it, dr. octavius!}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{okey... dokey... now that's what i call an experiment!!!}
<A>__{as he nears the light he actually becomes a part of it. he radiates light. he shimmers and shines. he fills the room with blinding light. spidey and liz shield their eyes, and as the light diminishes, the storm subsides. they're safe. except for the fact that they're in a floating building, 10,000 feet above the city!}
