<L>__{interior millard gymnasium day}
<A>__{the entire student body is assembled on the bleachers. there is a palpable mood of boredom and apathy. jerry slavin, a handicapped kid in a wheelchair, is at the microphone. his head lists to one side, and he takes long breaths as he speaks.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{i love millard high, and i will be a dedicated vice president. a vote for jerry slavin is a vote for good government. and even if i can't really stand up for you, i will.}
<P>__{(cracks himself up)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{jerry motors away amid scattered applause and coughs. jim steps forward, clapping, and raises the mike.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{thank you, jerry, and good luck. again, jerry is running unopposed for vice president. so we'll move on now to the presidential race with three candidates running. the first in alphabetical order is tracy flick.}
<A>__{tracy steps forward with a small stack of index cards. during her speech she flips the cards over one by one but rarely looks at them.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{poet henry david thoreau once wrote, "i cannot make my days longer, so i strive to make them better." with this election, we here at millard also have an opportunity to make our high school days better. during this campaign i have had the opportunity to speak with many of you about your concerns. i spoke with freshman eliza ramirez, who told me how alienated she feels from her own homeroom. i spoke with sophomore reggie banks, who said his mother works in a cafeteria and can't afford to buy him enough spiral notebooks for his classes. i won't bore you with long winded promises about all the new and innovative things i will definitely achieve during the year in which it will be my honor and privilege to represent each and every one of you, but i can say that my years of experience on the student council have taught me the three most important attributes the president needs to possess; commitment }
<C>__{doug schenken}
<D>__{eat me}
<C>__{doug's buddy}
<D>__{eat me raw!}
<A>__{there is scattered laughter. tracy pauses, wait hendricks bounds up and grabs the mike.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{if you can't be adults and give these candidates the courtesy they deserve, then you don't deserve to be called adults but children because that's what children are. and you'll be treated like children. so let's all listen up.}
<A>__{walt backs away to his seat. tracy resumes}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{the three most important attributes the president needs to possess are: commitment, qualifications, and experience. i will add one more; caring. i care about millard, and i care about each and every one of you, and together we can all make a difference. one of the things i would like to establish is a regular open forum where any student can come and voice their concern about issues we face here at millard. i and the rest of the student council would then interface with the faculty and staff, so a continuous dialogue would exist.}
<A>__{walt whispers to jim.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{i'd say she knows a thing or two about student faculty dialogue.}
<A>__{jim nods solemnly}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{when you cast your vote for tracy flick next week, you won't just be voting for me. you'll be voting for yourself and for every other student our days won't be any longer, but they can sure be better. thank you.}
<A>__{tracy smiles and walks back to her folding chair. there is polite applause and a few whistles. jjjb comes back to the microphone. tracy takes her seat next to paul and glances at him. paul scares straight ahead, a fat bead of sweat on his forehead. one of his legs is jiggling.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{the next candidate for student body president is paul metzier. paul?}
<A>__{paul awkwardly makes his way to the mike. though by no means thunderous, his applause clearly exceeds tracy's. a small cluster of jocks "woof" for him, shaking their fists in the air. paul manages a weak grin for his buddies. tracy shifts in her chair, her smile stiff and forced lisa smiles and nods at paul from the bleachers, giving him encouragement and a silent reminder to remember what they talked about. tammy's eyes dart between lisa and paul. she shows no emotion, reveals nothing. the applause quickly dies, and after a moment paul remembers to look at the white paper in his hand. he speaks in a barely audible monotone, never once glancing up.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{as many of you know i broke my leg pretty bad thi3 year and the experience has made me reevaluate what i want to do with my life and that is help people when you think about it a school is more than a school it's our second home where we spend all cur time and grow as individuals and a community but is our school everything it could be i want our school to reach its true potential that is why i am running for president.}
<A>__{jim pinches the bridge of his nose, clearly pained a few loud sound effect snores saw through the air, and walt points a stern finger at you guessed it doug schenken.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i know what it is to fight hard and win like when we almost went to state last fall and i threw that fourth quarter pass against westside for the touchdown that won the game by three points i won't let you down like i didn't then i promise we can all score a winning}
<P>__{(big breath)}
<D>__{touchdown together. vote paul metzier for president thank you.}
<A>__{paul now gets considerably less applause, but his jock friends remain loyal.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{okay, paul. now our final candidate for president another one of the metzier clan sophomore tammy metzier.}
<A>__{tammy approaches the mike. there are scattered mocking whistles and catcalls. tammy calmly looks over the crowd, waiting for the jeers to subside. she makes eye contact with lisa, who stares back.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{people. people i}
<A>__{the room quiets down. tammy puts her lips close to the mike,}
<C>__{tammy}
<D>__{who cares about this stupid election?}
<A>__{now there's something worth listening to.}
<C>__{tammy }
<D>__{we all know it doesn't matter who gets elected president of millard. you think it's going to change anything around here, make one single person happier or smarter or nicer? the only person it matters to is the one who gets elected. the same pathetic charade happens every year, and everyone makes the same pathetic promises just so they can put it on their transcripts to get into college. so vote for me, because i don't even want to go to college, and i don't care, and as president i won't do anything. the only promise i make is that if elected i will immediately dismantle the student government, so that none of us will ever have to sit through one of these stupid assemblies again!}
<A>__{there is a sudden huge cathartic eruption of cheers and applause. tammy has set them free. even cynical old doug schenken and his buddies join in.}
<C>__{students}
<D>__{tammy! tammy! tammy!}
<A>__{in total control, she steps back from the mike and curtsies. walt shoots an angry, confused look at jim, who shrugs. tracy is clearly upset, but her smile remains eerily fixed paul just looks confused and ashamed. jerry slavin is convulsed in laughter and chants along with the multitude. tammy quickly grabs the mike for one final exhortation.}
<C>__{tammy}
<D>__{0h don't vote for me i who cares? don't vote at all!}
<A>__{the students go nuts.}
