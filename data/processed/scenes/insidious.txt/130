<L>__{interior ballroom, the further continuous}
<A>__{from darkness into baroque extravagance. josh finds himself in a gilded chamber of long neglected opulence...as if a palace had been stormed, the occupants murdered and the place left to rot. mold caked pillars support a ceiling of gold flakes, the rest having rotted way. mirrors line the walls, their surface too clouded to see into.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{dalton...?}
<A>__{he weaves between pillars, finally coming across a figure, slumped on the floor in the corner like a dog. it is dalton. josh runs to him. his foot is chained to a pipe behind him, the clamp binding his right ankle. he looks pale and sick. he looks like one of them.}
<C>__{josh }
<D>__{i'm taking you back.}
<A>__{he sees that dalton is terrified. looking over josh's shoulder.}
<C>__{josh }
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{he glances back, spotting an open door at the end of the ballroom, light spilling from within it. there is somebody inside.}
