<L>__{interior munson house living room night}
<A>__{the room is filled with smoke. othar, slightly askew over the mantel, looks a little huffy. we hear clomping and screaming on the cellar stairs. lump bursts out, shrieking:}
<C>__{lump}
<D>__{blood, professor! oh my god! blood!}
<A>__{the general comes bounding up the stairs like a panther, a cigarette burning in his lips. he lands catlike in the living room, glides to the blubbering lump, grabs one shoulder firmly with one hand, and with the other slaps him sharply, once forehand, once backhand. lump stares at him, shocked, his blubbering cut short. more noise is coming from the stairs:}

<D>__{i gather there was a premature detonation }
<C>__{gawain}

<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{of course. simplest thing in the world. microsurgery }
<C>__{gawain}
<D>__{saw that motherfucker in a porno! thing still works!}
<A>__{pancake is pale from loss of blood and his pontifications lack full conviction:}
<C>__{pancake}
