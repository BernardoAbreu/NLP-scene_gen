<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior great hall and throne room day}
<A>__{pandemonium reigns. rochefort instructs his guards to close the huge door to the great hall. the members of the king's royal court run in panicked circles, convinced the palace is under seige. constance pauses amid the riot, seeks the queen. but richelieu has found her first. he steps to anne, assumes an air of priestly innocence.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{your majesty...}
<A>__{but louis steps into view, puts a protecting arm around his wife, speaks stern command:}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{leave us... alone.}
<A>__{that's when a loud boom rocks the room.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{the great door shudders under the impact of a terrific blow. another boom and the great hall is plunged into further chaos. the regiment of guards rush forward, press their bodies against the door to secure it. boom the great door threatens to split in half. richelieu huddles with rochefort amid the rising panic. his eyes narrow to mean slits, he gestures toward louis and anne across the room.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<P>__{(a cold whisper)}
<D>__{kill him. kill her, too.}
<A>__{rochefort draws d'artagnan's sword from its sheath. he advances on louis and anne. louis has witnessed the latter, treason confirmed. he raises his own sword, prepared to protect his queen. to die for her if necessary.}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(to anne)}
<D>__{get behind me.}
<A>__{rochefort takes confident steps toward the king. but one last boom and the great door comes crashing down on the guards, revealing a tide of musketeers on the other side. athos, porthos, and aramis at the lead. louis breaks into a wide grin. the musketeers wade into the guards, and the great hall is transformed into a battlefield. rochefort turns, sees athos charging at him.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{greetings, monsieur cyclops. are we interrupting?}
<C>__{rochefort}
<D>__{not for long.}
<A>__{athos and rochefort lock swords and duel.}
<B>__{battle}
<A>__{musketeers surround louis and anne to ward off attack. but the young king has no intention of being protected. he wades to the fore, fights side by side with his musketeers. anne watches him with a host of emotions. respect, admiration... love. louis pauses to return her gaze, then returns to battle. constance dashes through the fray. she sees a guard slip behind a curtain, approach the queen. she grabs a heavy goblet, shouts:}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{look out!}
<A>__{anne looks up. constance tosses the goblet to her. anne catches it neatly, brings it down on the head of the hapless guard. constance smiles, leaps forward. aramis cuts down a guard. as another man comes at him from behind, porthos intervenes, runs the man through. the two musketeers pause to exchange deadpan thanks, and continue. athos and rochefort slash at each other. it is a mighty confrontation. but athos soon gains the upper hand. rochefort shouts to a nearby guard for help. now it's two on one. athos receives a wound in the shoulder, he staggers... and the treaty falls from his tunic to the floor. rochefort reacts with a start, he grabs the treaty, stuffs it into his doublet. athos shakes off the sudden pain, disposes of the guard. rochefort and athos face each other a second time. athos wounded, rochefort confident he can finish the injured musketeer. but athos merely changes sword hands. rochefort reacts. their sabers clash as they draw together. rochefort grabs a dagger from his belt with his free hand. but athos sees it coming, and smashes rochefort across the face with his fist. rochefort goes sprawling. he loses his sword, it slides across the floor until someone's foot stops it. rochefort looks up... and sees d'artagnan standing on the blade.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{this sword belongs to me.}
<A>__{d'artagnan stoops to pick up his long lost sword. he tosses his other saber to rochefort, who catches it neatly. athos watches from a short distance, knows this moment belongs to d'artagnan. he will not intervene. but he shouts:}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{d'artagnan. kill him where he stands.}
<A>__{these are d'artagnan's words. a son vowing to avenge the death of his father. d'artagnan wonders. rochefort confirms.}
<C>__{rochefort}
<D>__{by all means. let's discover if you are as brave a man as your father was. and as foolish.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<P>__{(stunned by the}
<D>__{revelation as it}
<P>__{unfolds)}
<D>__{what...?}
<C>__{rochefort}
<D>__{he died for his king and for france. but most of all... he died on the end of my sword.}
<P>__{(the final curse)}
<D>__{as will you.}
<A>__{rochefort smiles a taunt. d'artagnan raises his sword, whispers to heaven.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{this is for you, father.}
<A>__{then, eyes blazing, d'artagnan attacks rochefort with everything he's got, driving him into an adjoining chamber.}
<B>__{angle to include chamber}
<A>__{a fire roars in a great stone hearth. its light projects giant shadows on the wall as d'artagnan and rochefort duel, slashing at each other.}
<B>__{great hall}
<A>__{athos, porthos, and aramis take the fight to the cardinal's guards. each with his by now familiar tradmarks. king louis fighting beside them. d'artagnan and rochefort they battle before the blazing fire, sweat covers their faces. rochefort wears a wolfish grin. but d'artagnan has learned his lessons well. he attacks with gusto. rochefort's grin soon turns toward desperation. he cannot match the boy's vengeful steel. so he drives a knee into d'artagnan's groin. d'artagnan falls to the floor. rochefort means to finish him there. but d'artagnan rolls away from the blade, leaps back to his feet. undaunted, he hurls himself at his hated opponent. rochefort sidesteps, throws d'artagnan against a wall. he pins him there, stunning the youth. and hisses with superior disdain:}
<C>__{rochefort}
<D>__{one thing's certain. you're no musketeer.}
<A>__{but d'artagnan remembers athos' advice. "always find your enemy's weakness." he shoves a thumb into rochefort's good eye. rochefort stumbles backward. d'artagnan plunges his sword into monsieur cyclops's heart.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{take it back...?}
<C>__{rochefort}
<D>__{i might... have been... mistaken.}
<A>__{rochefort crumples to the floor, dead. d'artagnan looks at rochefort's blood on his sword. his father's death finally avenged. that's when he hears the rustle of a silken robe. d'artagnan pivots, sees richelieu kneeling at rochefort's body... extracting the treaty from his doublet.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{no!!}
<A>__{richelieu smiles, hurls the treaty into the blazing fireplace. as the flames begin to lick at the parchment paper, d'artagnan flies past the cardinal, and dives after to retrieve it. athos, porthos, and aramis enter the room. d'artagnan stumbles out of the fireplace, covered with soot, clutching the treaty. he grins. on d'artagnan's look of triumph...}
