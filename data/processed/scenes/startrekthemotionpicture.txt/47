<L>__{interior bridge}
<A>__{kirk in the center seat, intently studying the naviga tion console in front of him (at the navigator's station, which is unoccupied.) other bridge personnel are busy with their pre launch duties.}
<C>__{uhura}
<D>__{transporters room and chief engineer scott report trans porter system fully repaired and now functioning normally, sir.}
<C>__{sulu}
<D>__{dock signals clear, captain.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{rely we are holding position awaiting final crew replacements.}
<C>__{uhura}
<D>__{captain, transporter personnel reports the navigator...}
<P>__{(consults console)}
<D>__{... lieutenant junior grade ilia}
<P>__{(eye lee ah) is already aboard,}
<D>__{and en route to the bridge.}
<A>__{angle on decker at the science station as decker (now wearing commander stripes) reacts, almost startled, and uhura continues:}
<C>__{uhura}
<D>__{she's a deltan.}
<A>__{uhura's tone and expression convey "deltan" in a certain, special manner.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(reprovingly)}
<D>__{and there are no finer navigators in starfleet, commander.}
<A>__{the last is interrupted by:}
<B>__{angle on the elevator doors}
<A>__{as they snap open, and there emerges a breathtakingly beautiful young woman (uniformed as a navigator lieu tenant) who strides purposefully onto the bridge. a stunning figure, but hairless, entirely bald but or delicate eyebrows and eyelashes. her bald head is not at all unattractive, in fact exudes an aura of sensual nudity. indeed, her whole being exudes sensuality. (this is a racial characteristic, not a deliberate presence.) she approaches kirk (note: throughout this sequence, sulu eyes ilia with unrestrained admiration.)}
<C>__{ilia}
<D>__{lieutenant ilia reporting for duty, sir.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(formally; rising)}
<D>__{welcome aboard, lieutenant.}
<B>__{across ilia to decker}
<A>__{as ilia starts to speak, suddenly stops: she has just then noticed decker, who has stepped from his station to face her. for an electronic moment their eyes meet, hold in unquestioned recognition.}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{hello, ilia.}
<C>__{ilia}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{decker....!}
<A>__{kirk has observed this with surprise and some concern (it presages possible complications). decker turns to kirk, slightly uncomfortable at this.}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{i was stationed on the lieutenant's home planet some years ago...}
<A>__{ilia looks from kirk back to decker, puzzled at his sleeve stripes.}
<C>__{ilia}
<P>__{(eyes his rank stripes)}
<D>__{'commander' decker?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{our exec and science officer...}
<C>__{decker}
<P>__{(bitingly)}
<D>__{captain kirk has the utmost confidence in me.}
<A>__{kirk flashes a hard glance at decker, then toward ilia too.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(pointedly)}
<D>__{and in you, too, lieutenant.}
<C>__{ilia}
<D>__{my oath of celibacy is on record captain. may i assume my duties?}
<A>__{while respectful, her tone of voice has been just as firm as kirk's.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{by all means.}
<B>__{across kirk to uhura}
<A>__{receiving a message, now relaying it.}
<C>__{uhura}
<D>__{captain, starfleet reports our last six crew members ready to beam up...}
<P>__{(puzzled)}
<D>__{... but one of them is refusing to step into the transporter.}
<A>__{just as kirk a moment before was tense, now suddenly he's relaxed again; he rises.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(pleased)}
<D>__{oh? i will see that he beams up...!}
<A>__{and he hurries from the bridge, onto the elevator, is gone. a moment of puzzled silence, then:}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{mr. sulu, take lieutenant ilia in hand.}
<C>__{sulu}
<P>__{(startled)}
<D>__{sir...?}
<P>__{(then understands)}
<D>__{yes, of course...}
<P>__{(to ilia)}
<D>__{your pre programming is already set in, lieutenant.}
<A>__{sulu has almost tripped getting out of his chair. he starts offering ilia his hand, then thinks better of it, withdraws it abruptly, immediately busies himself punching out equations on her console... ad libs, "it's all on the computer. you'll have no problem..." sulu is nervous, fluttery around this lovely creature now hits a wrong switch. produces a beeping sound which he fumbles to shut off. she smiles; speaks quietly, repeats:}
<C>__{ilia}
<D>__{i'm sworn to celibacy, mister sulu. that makes me as safe as any human female.}
<A>__{sulu catches her eye but before he can reply, decker has moved in beside ilia.}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{i now the captain meant no person al insult.}
<C>__{ilia}
<P>__{(eyes on console)}
<D>__{i would never take advantage of a sexually immature species.}
<P>__{(looks at him)}
<D>__{you can assure him that's true, can't you?}
<A>__{clearly, the remark carries special, personal significance.}
