<A>__{phil, still sitting at the cockpit controls, turns. through a side viewport he can just make out the greenhouse.}

<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{there's no answer. he rises.}
<L>__{exterior oxygen still. day}

<L>__{interior greenhouse. day}
<A>__{mcconnell sets down his helmet, starts exploring, pushing through fronds as he makes his way down an aisle. the dripping foliage is so dense it almost chokes his path. everywhere he looks, he has the sense of a scrounged together, recycled, jury rigged environment, where a great deal of ingenuity has come into play. he pauses, looking up... overhead, a bellows, stitched together from pieces of plastic tarp, slowly inhales and exhales, pumping air into a vent in the upper deck of the hab. its power comes from a crude water wheel, a buckets and strut assemblage, tidily sutured with duct tape, like some giant erector set. as mcconnell turns away from this, still marvelling, a ragged figure leaps through the foliage! it smashes into him, with a harsh screech, knocking him to the ground. mcconnell, on his back, straddled by his attacker, fights back as best he can. a blur of flailing arms and fists, as he tries to push the creature away. staring up, he catches a glimpse of the almost unrecognizable}
<B>__{luke graham}
<A>__{whose frightened eyes glare back at him through a swaying curtain of dreadlocks. his skin is creased, weathered, above a scraggly beard. his clothes are tattered, patched together. in one fist he grips a rock hammer, which he swings high overhead, about to drive the claw through mcconnell's skull. mcconnell grabs his arm desperately, trying to fend him off.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{luke, it's me! jim mcconnell!}
<A>__{we see a flash of uncertainty in luke's eyes. then he yanks his arm free, and his hammer arcs up even higher, trembles in the air.}

<D>__{you're not here!}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{luke, it's jim!}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no, no, you're not... you can't be here.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{your wife is debra! your son is bobby! you were reading treasure island with him...!}
<A>__{as he stares down at mcconnell, luke's eyes finally light up with recognition. but before he can move, he is seized from behind and flung backwards to the ground, the hammer ripped from his grasp, as terri and phil pinion his arms. mcconnell scrambles to his feet.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{don't hurt him!}
<A>__{mcconnell kneels beside luke, signalling to terri and phil that it's okay to let him go. they stand back, pulling off their helmets. everyone is panting, out of breath. luke sits up, slowly studying their features, one after another, as if still not quite certain whether they might vanish. his voice is hoarse, rusty from disuse.}

<D>__{phil... terri...}

<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{he didn't make it luke.}
<A>__{luke stares at mcconnell, trying to absorb everything. he looks to terri, who looks down.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{oh no.}
<A>__{luke shakes his head in dismay. he seems to shrink in on himself. it's all too much for him to take in. mcconnell kneels and puts his arm around luke, comforting him.}
