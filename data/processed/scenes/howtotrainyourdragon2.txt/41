<L>__{exterior skies berk night}
<A>__{dragon roars grow louder as hiccup & co. approach through clouds, racing against time. they collectively gasp at the sight of drago's bewilderbeast having now covered most of the village in explosions of ice. berk's now commandeered dragons circle in a huddle behind him, joining valka's flock, and corralled by drago's armored dragons.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{fishlegs}
<D>__{he took all the dragons!}
<C>__{hiccup}
<P>__{(fuming)}
<D>__{distract the alpha. try to keep his focus off of toothless.}
<C>__{tuffnut}
<D>__{uh... how?}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{have you forgotten who you're riding with?}
<A>__{he brazenly aims his baby dragon toward the bewilderbeast.}
<C>__{eret }
<D>__{there isn't a dragon alive that i can't wrangle!}
<A>__{his baby dragon dives toward the sea instead.}
<C>__{eret }
<D>__{except for this one!}
<C>__{snotlout}
<D>__{amateur.}
<A>__{the others shrug and follow. as they get closer, the bewilderbeast looms bigger and bigger. berk's vikings in hiding notice hiccup and the others as they approach.}
<D>__{viking #1 look, it's hiccup!}
<A>__{the vikings cheer. on drago, surprised to see hiccup and the others approaching.}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{with an irate huff, the bewilderbeast focuses on hiccup, gaining ever closer to toothless. suddenly, a sheep appears in its sight, rising and falling out of view. the bewilderbeast blinks, confused. it looks down to see eret catching the falling sheep and reloading it into the game launcher, as tuffnut cocks the mechanism and ruffnut pulls the trigger.}
<C>__{ruffnut}
<D>__{keep `em coming!}
<A>__{snotlout tosses the black sheep to tuffnut.}
<C>__{snotlout}
<D>__{black sheep, baby!}
<A>__{exasperated, the alpha inhales, about to blast, when... honk! the game horn blares, breaking his concentration. he turns, finding the horn unmanned. the bewilderbeast then returns his focus to the sheep launcher, until the black sheep lands on the his face, bouncing down his facial spines and becoming lodged.}
<C>__{snotlout }
<D>__{ten points!}
<A>__{the bewilderbeast shakes the black sheep off and prepares to blast again.}
<C>__{snotlout }
<D>__{uh oh...}
<A>__{honk! the alpha whips around still no one at the horn. on fishlegs, giggling and hiding behind the game horn. the bewilderbeast finally lets loose the ice blast, covering the entire horn in jagged spikes... as fishlegs leaps from the platform.}
<C>__{fishlegs}
<D>__{i'm okay!}
<B>__{back to hiccup}
<A>__{as he reaches drago, hovering directly in toothless' sights.}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{you certainly are hard to get rid of. i will say that.}
<A>__{hiccup ignored him and focuses on toothless' slitted pupils.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{toothless? it's me, bud. it's me. i'm right here. come back to me.}
<A>__{toothless' pov: hiccup appears as an unfamiliar red blur, still firmly under the control of the bewilderbeast.}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{he is not yours anymore. he belongs to the alpha!}
<A>__{drago smugly sits back in the saddle, his arms open in invitation.}
<C>__{drago }
<D>__{but, please, oh great dragon master, try to take him. he will not miss a second time.}
<A>__{hiccup holds strong, maintaining eye contact with toothless. he reaches out to touch him.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{it wasn't your fault, bud. they made you do it.}
<A>__{drago's amusement fades as toothless stirs. his pupils dilate, then narrow again.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{you'd never hurt him.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you'd never hurt me.}
<A>__{drago watches, amazed, as toothless fights the control.}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{how are you doing that?}
<A>__{hiccup holds the stare, tears in his eyes.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{please. you are my best friend, bud.}
<A>__{bewilderbeast roars a forceful command.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{my best friend.}
<A>__{toothless' pupils jitter, then dilate fully. he coos sympathetically.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{thatta boy! that's it! i'm here!}
<A>__{toothless' eyes finally dilate fully and resolve on hiccup's familiar face. drago goes from astounded to alarmed. drago strikes toothless with the bull hook in a vain attempt to regain control.}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{toothless roars defiantly, snatches the bull hook in his jaws, and pulls... yanking drago off of his back and sending him both plummeting to the sea.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{yeah!}
<A>__{but without a rider, toothless drops out of the sky as well. hiccup leaps from the baby dragon, diving after him.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{hang on!}
<A>__{drago breaks his fall, landing heavily upon the bewilderbeast's tusk... as hiccup tucks in his arms, trying to close the gap between he and toothless before they both make impact with the ocean.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{almost there, buddy. almost there!}
<A>__{hiccup reaches toothless. they pair up, mid air, and skyrocket past drago as he hobbles to the top of the alpha's head.}
