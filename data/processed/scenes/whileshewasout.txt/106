<L>__{exterior deadwood pile evening}
<A>__{there it is, a deadwood pile. she throws herself down into its midst. the dried branches jag and tear at her hands and face. she burrows down low, so low she's right in the dirt. she peers between the branches. tomas's feet run by and disappear. she hears him circle the area then turn back towards her. a moment passes. she picks the nexterior rises slowly and softly from between the jagged branches clutching the lug wrench. and then there he is. diving out of the trees towards her. della raises the lug wrench. in the clouded moonlight it's an almost biblical image: a woman rising from the brush wielding an iron black cross. tomas crashes towards her. della swings the lug wrench, hard, intensely, directly at tomas's face. there is a thud as the sharp arm of the lug wrench catches him up under the chin. it sends him reeling. he goes down face first. della gasps in horror, watches as: tomas pulls himself up onto his feet, comes towards her once more. della swings the lug wrench back and strikes him across the head. he spins, clutches at his head, then reaches towards her}
<B>__{again.}
<A>__{she loses it. she swings the lug wrench towards him. all the years of pent up rage finally find their release. the wrench catches up under his nose with a sickening crunch. it drives the cartilage up and into his face. blood spurts from the wound. he staggers backwards. a shocked scream escapes from della's mouth.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{awwwrgh!}
<A>__{as she staggers backwards in the opposite direction. tomas tries to cry out but can only utter in pain.}
<C>__{tomas}
<D>__{unnh! unnh! unnh!}
<A>__{he tries to pull the lug wrench out of his face. spins. stumbles. the flashlight beam travels past them.}
<C>__{tomas }
<D>__{unnh!}
<A>__{tomas crashes back into a tree. he loses consciousness. his body slumps slowly down the tree trunk to the dirt. blood gushes from where the wrench meets his face. he looks like he's dressed for halloween. della just stares. stares at tomas, at what she did, what she had to do. tomas' eyes are wide open, staring too, at nothing, dead. the horror of having killed someone overwhelms della. she starts shaking with shock. vinh cries out for tomas}
<C>__{vinh }
<D>__{tomas!}
<A>__{the sound of footfalls crashing through the brush follows.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{curb the squealing. you a gangsta or a boy scout?}
<A>__{vinhs voice is breathless and jittery.}
<C>__{vinh }
<D>__{tomas's gone, chuckie. i can feel it.}
<A>__{della tears herself away from tomas's body and staggers into the deadwood to collect the toolbox. it glints, even in the darkness. she grabs it and runs for cover behind a tree. behind her in the near distance the chaotic sweeps of the flashlight illuminates vinh and chuckie as they march through the woods searching for tomas.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{tomas is one hard son of a bitch. he got her strung up from a tree by now and you know it.}
<A>__{but chuckie doesn't look so sure. vinh charges ahead into the darkness. della flashes briefly into shot, running between the trees. the flashlight sweeps by.}
<C>__{vinh}
<D>__{there's something over here.}
<A>__{chuckie walks towards vinh. vinh takes the flashlight from chuckie and shines it towards a thick shape between three trees.}
<C>__{vinh }
<D>__{it looks like a body.}
<A>__{they close in on a muddle of shapes, bush and spidery tree trunks. the flashlight illuminates a tree trunk long and thick as a body.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{it's a big old tree trunk, you paranoid gook.}
<A>__{chuckie tries to take the flashlight back from vinh but vinh won't give it. chuckie doesn't persist. vinh keeps going, shivering and blustering. vinh senses something. he shines the flashlight behind the tree trunk. still nothing. sweeps back. della darts between the evergreens behind them. she conceals herself in between the trunks and branches. braces herself, waits for the right moments, the ones when they're not looking, to run between the trees. cognizant enough to know they just want to find tomas right now. she seems to be on autopilot, becoming numb as the minutes stretch on. she watches vinh plod forward and through the brush. he hits every inch of it with the flashlight. sighs. doubles back to follow chuckie. then, the flashlight catches a glimpse of something. sweeps back, illuminates tomas's dead body, splayed out on the mud at the foot of the tree, eyes staring wide, bloody, ghastly. tomas's catholic cross pendant glimmers in the flashlight. silence until vinh falls to his knees in front of tomas, tries to speak but only a whisper comes out.}
<C>__{vinh}
<D>__{tomas.....iyah!}
<A>__{chuckie realizes from vinh's demeanor that something really is wrong. he hesitates a moment, then rushes over to vinh, stares too at tomas's body, gulps back the desire to scream. he punches his fist hard into the tree behind tomas' body instead. a shower of pine needles rains down on them. chuckie grabs the flashlight and sweeps it away from the body, grabs vinh's arm, grounding him. vinh sobs and shakes.}
<C>__{vinh }
<D>__{she gonna kill you and me nexterior we're all gonna die here. god knows what other tools she got in that box.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{it was a stupid ass accident killed huey. you know that. and tomas....}
<A>__{chuckie chokes up despite himself. he stands up, brushes the pine needles off his tee shirt. he paces back and forth. he pulls the gun out from deep in his jeans. della creeps between the trees behind them. she appears for a second or two, like a ghost, behind the next tree. chuckie defiantly fights back tears.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{i promise you this.}
<A>__{he kisses the gun.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{this baby's gonna cancel her christmas.}
<A>__{della darts between the trees, faster now. their voices follow her.}
<C>__{vinh }
<D>__{ain't no gun can kill a ghost gone bad.}
<A>__{she staggers deeper and deeper into the forest, into the darkness.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{you in america now, dude, where the ghosts bleed.}
<A>__{she hears a faint gurgle. she slows, listens. it's the burble of a stream.. she listens hard. traces the sound. treads towards it. there it is. glistening, even in the dark.}
