<D>__{what the hell...}
<L>__{interior galaxie}
<A>__{as grady lolls behind the steering wheel, a cloud appears, hovering, then slowly mutates, and grady realizes it's not a cloud at all, it's marilyn monroe standing by the side mirror, wearing a bright pink dress under her wedding jacket.}
<C>__{marilyn}
<D>__{i know you. . .}
<A>__{marilyn's face swims before grady's eyes, but there's something wrong with it. this girl's eyes are brown and besides, she's ...fat.}
<C>__{marilyn }
<D>__{double dickel on the rocks.}
<A>__{the last of the fairy dust evaporates and grady finds standing before him in a pink jersey dress and marilyn monroe's wedding jacket 0ola, the pregnant waitress from the hi hat club.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{oola.}
<C>__{oola}
<D>__{i never forget a drink.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i never forget an oola.}
<A>__{suddenly, there is a heavy click.}
<C>__{man's voice }
<D>__{forget me?}
<A>__{grady starts to turn, but his head won't move: largely because the barrel of a german nine is pressed to his temple. grady's eyes slide.}

<D>__{vernon.}
<C>__{vernon}
<P>__{(to oola)}
<D>__{move away, cupcake. he's got a gun.}

<C>__{grady}
<D>__{relax, vernon...}
<C>__{oola}
<D>__{why's he calling you vernon?}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{why's he sitting in my car? he's crazy, that's why. he probably calls everybody vernon.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{not true. you're the only vernon i know. actually, i'm wrong. i once knew a vernon peabody at penguin u.k.}
<C>__{vernon}

<D>__{you' re not going to shoot him, are you?}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{i'm going to shoot him. if he doesn't put that gun down.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{it's just a souvenir. they don't even make the caps anymore.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{bullshit. i know a gun when i see one. and that's a gun.}
<C>__{grady}
