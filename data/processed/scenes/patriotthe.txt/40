<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{marion nods, uncomfortable with the thanks.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{sergeant, there are seventeen wounded men here. seven redcoats and ten patriots, counting my son inside. that puts me in a difficult position.}
<A>__{the continental sergeant knows what's coming. the privates and marion's children don't.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{you three are the least severely wounded. i have to ask you to leave and find care elsewhere.}
<A>__{the privates are stunned at the request. the sergeant looks at marion's children and nods.}
<C>__{sergeant}
<D>__{i understand.}
<A>__{he struggles to his feet and jerks his head for the two privates to do the same.}
<C>__{sergeant}
<D>__{come on, boys.}
<A>__{nathan, samuel and margaret are confused.}
<C>__{thomas}

<D>__{after the battle of ashuelot river, against the french, i got this and the one on my leg. i couldn't walk. washington had to march north. he left me with other wounded men and a like number of french prisoners. nine for nine. when the french found us, their surgeon gave me the best of care. we'll be safe this way.}
<A>__{marion's children are not convinced. the sergeant and the two privates gather themselves to leave.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{your best chance is in bennington, seven miles east, along the river road.}
