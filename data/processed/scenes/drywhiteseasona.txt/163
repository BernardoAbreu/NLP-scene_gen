<L>__{interior ben's study day}
<A>__{a 8x10 black and white photograph on ben's desk. on the photograph a naked man and a girl on a bed and a bedside lamp on its side. the man is ben and the girl is melanie. stolz in sports jacket, standing next to the desk is speaking... patronizing.}
<C>__{stolz}
<D>__{we're all made of flesh and blood, mr. du toit we've all got our flaws. and if a man likes to sample the grass on the other side of the fence, well, that's his own business. but it would be unpleasant if people found out about it, especially if he's a teacher.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you mean, if i cooperate, if i stop digging, embarrassing you, threatening you... these photographs will disappear.}
<C>__{stolz}
<D>__{let's just say i may be able to use my influence to make sure that a private indiscretion isn't used against you.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{suppose i refuse?}
<A>__{stolz looks past ben.}
<C>__{stolz}
<D>__{is this your son?}
<A>__{ben whirls around to see johan at the door. he shoots, puts himself between the photograph and his son obviously surprised to find capt. stolz there.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{johan, leave us alone, please.}
<A>__{johan walks away.}
<C>__{stolz}
<D>__{don't you think this business has gone long enough?}
<A>__{ben, struggling to maintain his composure.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{that's for you people to decide. isn't it? i won't be blackmailed, captain not even by you.}
<C>__{stolz}
<D>__{mind if i smoke?}
<A>__{ben answers by a gesture.}
<C>__{stolz}
<P>__{(after lighting his cigarette)}
<D>__{now be honest. has all the evidence you've been collecting in connection with gordon ngubene brought you closer to the truth you are looking for?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{yes, i think so and there's more to come.}
<A>__{a pause.}
<C>__{stolz}
<D>__{i really hoped we could talk man to man.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{it's not possible, captain. not between you and me.}
<C>__{stolz}
<D>__{it's high time, mr. du toit, we allowed the dead to rest in peace. i'm offering you a chance.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you mean my very last chance?}
<C>__{stolz}
<D>__{one never knows. it may not be important to you, but we have to survive.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{if we can only survive through murder and torture, then we have forfeited our right to exist.}
<A>__{slowly and deliberately stolz stubs out his cigarette in the ashtray.}
<C>__{stolz}
<D>__{is that your final answer?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{before you go. i will tell this, captain. i have a pretty good idea of what i will eventually uncover. i mean the truth. and i won't allow anyone or anything to come between me and that truth.}
<A>__{ben walks up to the door to see him out. there's no response from stolz. he calmly takes a small card out of his pocket and rests it on ben's desk.}
<C>__{stolz}
<D>__{here's my card my private line. if you should change your mind... let's say before the end of the week?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{goodbye, captain, and don't forgt the photograph.}
<A>__{stolz picks up the photograph and puts it into his briefcase.}
<C>__{stolz}
<P>__{(leaving)}
<D>__{be careful, mr. du toit. there are people who can make things very difficult for you.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{they are wasting their time. they just can't hurt me anymore. i trust you'll give them the message, captain.}
<A>__{he walks out. ben follows him 'round the garage and watches him get into his car and drive away. johan joins his father.}
<C>__{johan}
<P>__{(mischievous)}
<D>__{a brandy, papa?}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(smiling back, ruffling his hair)}
<D>__{a gin and tonic would be fine.}
