<D>__{the brown paper bag is the only thing civilized man has produced that does not seem out of place in nature. crumpled into a wad of wrinkles, like the fossilized brain of a dryad; its kinship to tree (to knot and nest) unobscured by the cruel crush of industry; absorbing the elements like any other organic entity; blending with rock and vegetation as if it were a burrowing owl's door mat or a jack rabbit's underwear, a no. 8 kraft paper bag lay discarded in the hills of dakota and appeared to live where it lay. once long ago, it had borne a package of buns and a jar of mustard to a kitchenette rendezvous with a fried hamburger. more recently, the bag had held........ love letters.}
