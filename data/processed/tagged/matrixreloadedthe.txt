<T>__{fade in on:}
<A>__{dark clouds below the inky remnants of the scorched sky. we hear wind as we sail, like a glider, over the black atmosphere. we dive down into the murkiness, through the clouds, into the darker world of the dead surface of earth, the desert of the real. the rotted skeleton of a massive city is sprawled everywhere. we approach a fissure in the earth's crust, and as we do, we hear the increasing buzz of multiple hovercraft engines. blue flashes grow in intensity from the fissure. radio voices, indistinct at first, grow louder as we approach the fissure.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{six o'clock, 300 meters. we can't outrun 'em.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{i know. can't tow this crate fast enough! we gotta ditch it!}
<A>__{we hear the voices as though we're listening to cops through a police scanner. the woman is niobe, the captain of the lead ship, sephora.}
<C>__{niobe }
<D>__{can't, the core is still good. and they've got 'the one.'}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{oooh, our savior. hed better be worth it.}
<C>__{niobe }
<D>__{shut up and make the exit. hold on!}
<A>__{the azure glow from the fissure is suddenly overwhelming. a tight convoy of three hovercraft explode from the fissure, traveling nearly straight up, like a trio of massive locomotives flying into the sky in tight formation, linked together by tow cables. the blue glow has been emanating from the overworked flare drives of the first and third hovercrafts. between them, suspended by tow cables, is the dark, scorched, and sliced nebachanezzer. they rocket upward, slowing as they reach the top of the arc.}
<C>__{niobe }
<D>__{woo hoooh!}
<A>__{the rush to the ground, pulling up at the last second. the neb flails wildly between them.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{they're still on us!}
<A>__{more vehicles fly from the fissure. a massive army of squiddies pours up onto the surface.}
<L>__{interior nebachanezzer cockpit}
<A>__{the neb is slung between the two hovercraft, with the cockpit facing backwards. trinity, morpheus, tank, and neo, the former thomas anderson, crowd the cockpit. helpless, the landscape speeds away from them, while a wall of red eyed squiddies speeds to them. it's been a mere two days since the realization of neos powers and the defeat of agent smith. the slipstream whistles violently into the interior of the ship, and the crew is cold, tired, haggard, and stressed beyond belief as they can only watch the action in their knocked out ship.}
<D>__{morpheus is on a headset.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{niobe, theyre closing.}
<C>__{niobe}
<D>__{how many?}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{just a few. maybe two or three. hundred.}
<L>__{interior sephora cockpit}
<A>__{niobe, as regal as she is beautiful, sits at the controls of her ship with her co pilot, a younger female. all visible dials are redlined as they streak over the dark surface.}
<C>__{niobe}
<D>__{youve got a gift for understatement.}
<L>__{interior freedom cockpit}
<A>__{the freedoms captain, a silhouette in a dark cockpit, is flying blind. his cockpit is awash in the blue flares from niobes ship. his lieutenant, a shadowy female figure, reaches for the radar screen. as she does, we see her bare shoulder fall into view, a white rabbit tattoo is conspicuous. they switch their screens to the radar, squiddies right on their ass.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{oh shit, were screwed. we gotta set down and emp em.}
<C>__{niobe }
<D>__{too many!}
<L>__{exterior freedom hull}
<A>__{a racing squiddies reaches the hull and latches on, striking up its cutting laser and ripping into the hull.}
<L>__{interior sephora cockpit}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{theyre on me! shit! losing power!}
<A>__{niobes lieutenant, a muscular asian woman, circa, notes something on a console.}
<C>__{circa}
<D>__{multiple bogies closing!}
<C>__{niobe}
<D>__{no shit.}
<C>__{circa}
<D>__{from the front!}
<A>__{niobe is grim faced as she peers into the sky ahead. several objects are closing in fast.}
<C>__{circa}
<D>__{are they }
<A>__{she doesn't have time to finish the question, as the oncoming fighters launch a massive volley of missiles. from afar, they look like dark irises surrounded by a corona of flame. at first, we can't tell exactly what they are, until their fiery trails rip straight at the sephora cockpit. circa ducks as the missiles harmlessly streak by.}
<L>__{interior neb cockpit}
<A>__{a massive swarm off missiles blasts by the cockpit. the individual warheads swerve at the last second, blowing squiddies apart, or casting them to the ground aflame.}
<L>__{interior sephora cockpit}
<A>__{niobe breathes a sigh of relief. her lieutenant looks back up to see a wing of hover fighters 'defenders' fly past their ship. sleek, with huge blue flares from their engines, they're gunship fighters armed to the teeth with missiles and laser turrets studding the fuselage.}
<C>__{niobe}
<D>__{they're ours.}
<C>__{defender one }
<D>__{hold on, folks, you're in for a little cleaning.}
<L>__{exterior the surface}
<A>__{the wing of defenders makes short work of the squiddies. the half dozen clinging to freedom's hull are picked off by well placed laser shots that turn the squiddies into curdling balls of slag. the squiddies that survive turn tail and run.}
<L>__{interior neb cockpit}
<A>__{the crew of the neb breathe a collective sigh of relief as they leave the scene of aerial carnage behind them. neo has been gripping an oh shit handle on the edge of the cockpit. he relaxes his grip as their escape is clear. their ship suddenly enters a cave, and starts to descend. the blue wash of the ship shows rock walls and pipes. the ships are slowing down as they descend back into the earth. tank's shoulders drop, and he leans back into his chair.}
<C>__{tank}
<D>__{we're home.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{well, not yet, but we're in the defense screen.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{a concentric ring of defenses that shields zion. the fighters that just saved us constitute the first ring.}
<C>__{niobe }
<D>__{neb crew, you can relax now.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{for the moment, perhaps. its still a long drive home.}
<T>__{fade out:}
<A>__{and}
<T>__{fade into:}
<A>__{trinity's cabin. at first we see only stars twinkling, faraway diamonds on a black velvet background. the camera descends through the darkness, to a sunset, dark blue, as if just after sunset. the artwork terminates in the metal ring going around her room. it's a much more hospitable place than the rest of the dreary hovercraft. the articles she's collected during her time in the resistance dot the cabin. an unfinished sweatshirt sits on a loom. there are charcoal portraits of loved ones. softly lit, the cabin sways slightly. the neb is still in tow. neo is sitting against the wall on trin's bed, with her curled up beside him with her head on his lap. neo cant sleep. he stares at the wall opposite him. there's a photo of the crew of the neb, sans trin, in better days. smiling, laughing as they are seated around the table. morpeus, tank, dozer, switch, epoch, mouse. neo stops on the image of a smiling cypher. there's an unknown asian man in the photo, looking withdrawn and a bit lonely. gently, placing trinity's head down, neo stands and examines the photo.}
<D>__{she awakens.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{i will have to take that one down now. cypher...}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{who is this guy?}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{who? neo points to the mystery man.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{that was... i... forgot his name.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{what happened to him? trinity is sullen. he didnt make it.}
<A>__{neo returns to the bed and sits down, disturbed. trinity sits up,}
<D>__{awakening.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{was he like me? trinity nods.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{not you, though. like you. there have been others, neo. aren't you tired?}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{no. i've never been a big sleeper.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{i know. i used to watch you hacking without sleeping for days. he turns to her, questions in his eyes.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{how many 'ones' have there been?}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{that's not the pointerior neo may not think so.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{you are him. youre mine.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{but what does it mean, to be the one?}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{i don't know, neo. our mission was to find you.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{so, now what?}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{now, zion will give us a new mission. the hatch swings open. morpheus peers in.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{we're almost home. we'll need a detail. five minutes. he closes the hatch and disappears.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{does he ever knock?}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{not on his ship.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior main deck, neb}
<A>__{the crew grips the bulkhead and fixtures as the swaying ship comes to a rest. outside, the sounds of hover engines fade away. tank unlocks the main hatch, then jumps as it drops, unpowered, slamming into the tarmac with a resounding smash.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior zion tarmac}
<A>__{the tarmac is a busy, crowded military airport, with hovercraft of different sizes spread across the lot. its housed poorly lit, houses in a cave so huge the ceiling is out of site. crewpersons run around, servicing battle damaged vehicles. munitions are carted across the tarmac on robot rolling racks. no one pays the neb and its battered crew any mind. nearby, the sephora and freedom are parked. their engines shut down, and their powered hatches are open. the crewmembers are spilling out. niobe hurries to morpheus' side, and he steps toward her, smiling, but their military manner is quickly restored, though they can barely contain their grins.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{niobe... she shakes his hand, the shake slows down.}
<C>__{m.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{thanks for the rescue.}
<A>__{they close for a kiss, when the freedom's captain suddenly jumps}
<D>__{between them. it's choi the neo's supposed neighbor and hacking financier. exhuberant and oblivious, he joyfully gets in morpheus' face.}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{brough, you us your asses! we saved you so hard core you don't even know!}
<A>__{niobe smiles at morpheus and fades back as booth shouts his own}
<D>__{praises. morpheus turns to his less mature peer.}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{so, you think you finally found the one, huh? another one?}
<A>__{dujour, choi's lieutenant, pushes into their conversation, looking}
<D>__{offscreen.}
<C>__{dujour}
<D>__{idiot, we helped him find him. hello, morpheus.}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{huh? he looks at what she's seeing. his gaze halts on neo. he's}
<A>__{concentrating on tank and his apparent girlfriend, who seems to be consoling him. he turns to see choi and dujour, does a double take,}
<D>__{and his jaw drops open.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{you? choi is quick to resume his cool.}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{in the flesh, so to speak.}
<C>__{dujour}
<D>__{welcome to the real world, neo. i'm glad you're here.}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{what do you think, dujour? should we take him with us?}
<C>__{dujour}
<D>__{definitely.}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{morpheus?}
<A>__{morpheus turns from niobe and a zion officer. he addresses trinity, glancing at the others.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{go on ship's liberty. meet me in the dead duck at 21:00 hours, drunk or sober.}
<L>__{exterior zion street}
<A>__{it's like a valley floor running between two gigantic walls of rock that are nearly vertical, coming together in an elongated archway. carved into the street level are innumerable stores and shops, above them, apartments and balconies that rise to the top of the arch. people flow through the street. their clothes are homespun wool, denim, and leather. dyes and color are absent. carved into the solid granite walls, between homes and around windows and doors, are intricate and beautiful carvings. neo is lead down the street by choi, dujour, and trinity, and a few other rebels. the push through a mult culti crowd of people, humanity melting into one race.}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{see, man? this is home. this is the main street. one of em, anyway. almost everyone is a fighter. sometimes, even the kids.}
<A>__{they pass an outdoor workshop where youngsters are assembling small machines.}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{our energy as a people is directed toward liberation. check it out, here are some newcomers.}
<A>__{a group of frail, buzz cut androgonites pass by them. they look at}
<D>__{neo, recognizing him as one of them, a new comer.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{where did they come from?}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{"energy plant we raided on our last mission. there were some survivors."}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{how are their minds freed from the matrix?}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{with difficulty.}
<C>__{dujour}
<D>__{if at all.}
<A>__{they step into a club, dead duck. its a sailor jointerior lots of wood, beer on tap, and rum. crewmembers of other ships recognize the rebels, greeting them, as they eye neo. they take a booth in the corner. the waitress arrives.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{welcome home, brothers and sisters. first day back?}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{yes, lovely.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{on the house, then. four rums?}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{make it eight. the waitress smirks and leaves. trinity turns to choi.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{any casualties? choi lights up and takes a drag.}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{two. sidewinder and left right.}
<C>__{dujour}
<D>__{i cant believe cypher turned. bastard.}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{he who loses faith...}
<C>__{dujour}
<D>__{neo, we monitored your fight. did you really gain enlightenment? neo shrugs.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{all i know is i kicked smiths ass.}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{fuckin finally, jesus christ. its about time we iced that bastard.}
<C>__{dujour}
<D>__{yeah, we finally won against an agent?}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{i guess 1 n 298 isnt a bed record, huh? the drinks arrive. tall glasses of rum. choi holds his glass aloft. they raise their glasses to toast.}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{live free or die.}
<C>__{all }
<D>__{live free.}
<A>__{they slam the rum back, and slam empty glasses on the table. neo can barely manage to sip his.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{god, how do you do that?}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{youve never drank before.}
<C>__{dujour}
<D>__{not for real.}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{you want to know what being the one means?}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{one drink and youre toast.}
<C>__{dujour}
<D>__{neo, you know what else youve never done?}
<A>__{she glances at trinity, who falls back against the seat, turning to suppress a smile. choi cracks up.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{dujour}
<D>__{yeah, youve never done it.}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{and virtual doesnt count, man, doesnt fucking count.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{well. ill drink to that.}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{here, here.}
<A>__{this time, neo follows the others and slams back the entire glass. he coughs and sputters as his friends and bar patrons cheer him on."}
<L>__{exterior main street, zion}
<A>__{the lights are dim, and only a few late night revelers stagger through the streets on their way back home. walking straight and calmly through the stragglers are morpheus and niobe.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{so, how do you like having your own command?}
<C>__{niobe}
<D>__{its good. but trying. the responsibility... they stop before the entrance to the dead duck.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{you must be both mother and father to your crew.}
<A>__{niobe nods, and looks into the bar. inside, the crews are raging drunk and loud.}
<C>__{niobe}
<D>__{who will you be now? the mother, or the father? morpheus peers in on the scene and grins.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{as long as they dont get out of line, ill just be a brother.}
<L>__{interior dead duck}
<A>__{neo is out of it, while the others are merely comfortably in the bag. hes acting like a kid who broke into his fathers liquor cabinet.}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{so, you went back in, and you two pulled him out?}
<A>__{trinity nods, herself in disbelief. neo picks his head up off the table.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{kicked... kicked smiths ass. choi eyes morphes and niobe coming toward them.}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{hey, did you kick anybody elses ass, neo? like morpheus?}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{morpheus? yeah, i smacked him around, too.}
<A>__{morpheus arrives just in time to hear the last part. he stands and grins down at neo.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{so, you can smack me around, neo?}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{oh yeah. anytime.}
<A>__{morpheus taps him on the forehead. neo blinks and falls back into the booth. he stands before them.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{hows tank?}
<C>__{morpheus}
<A>__{"hes on bereavement leave with his mother. dozer was the second son}
<D>__{shes lost in this war." his comments set a sober tone.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<A>__{"the nebechanezzer is out of commission for at least a month. but,}
<D>__{thats not giving us a rest."}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{let me guess. weve been ordered back out anyway.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<A>__{"yes. this is another special op. im in command, niobe and trinity}
<D>__{are team leaders. neo is our secret weapon." flash to: neo, passed out with his mouth open on the couch.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<A>__{"we dont know exactly what hes capable of. he may be just tapping his potential, or he may have already reached it. we are to learn from}
<D>__{him, as he does from us."}
<C>__{choi}
<A>__{"why are we always getting screwed? not only do i have to go straight}
<D>__{back into the shit, but i lose my command, too?"}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{youve been assigned to this mission because youre the best, choi.}
<C>__{dujour}
<A>__{"yeah, and headquarters thinks you might be able to whine the agents}
<D>__{to death."}
<C>__{choi}
<A>__{"oh my god thats so funny. my point is, dont we need some r and r? unwind a little? we lost two crew on the last one, you lost like five, right? shit. im glad we found mr. invincible, here, but jesus..."}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{you dont have to go, choi. volunteers only.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{hes got a point, m. i have faith, but why so quick?}
<C>__{morpheus}
<A>__{"we have a chance, here, but the window of opportunity is brief. our ships say the matrix is already upgrading and re coding to block our}
<D>__{entry. and neos."}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{fuck. every fucking time we get another one, this is what they do.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{he is the one.}
<C>__{dujour}
<D>__{you havent lost the faith, have you choi? choi grabs a half filled rum glass and swigs it down.}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{well, these are the times that try mens souls. heres to victory.}
<L>__{exterior tunnel}
<A>__{the freedom hovers slowly, silently, like a submarine as it cruises through the murky depths. it suddenly comes to a quiet stop, and descends. the engines fade out, and the vessel rests, darkened, on the cave. a quartet of squiddies slips by. we follow as they worm their ways through the twisted passageway, watching as they pass the bubble cockpit by mere feet. freeze on the cockpit. within the shadows we see morpheus and choi at the controls.}
<L>__{interior freedom cockpit}
<D>__{they watch the squiddies fade into the distance.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{power up. sleep mode.}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{aye aye, capitano.}
<A>__{minimal cockpit displays turn on, and the cabin remains dark.}
<L>__{interior main deck}
<A>__{the ships operator, a lean asian kid with a gaze like a laser scan, sits behind neo, whos sitting at the operators console with his hands on the abbreviated keyboard. trinity sits with them, her feet up as she observes. neo stares at the screen. its a huge syllabus of matrix code characters. he struggles to learn the complex code.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{"ka equals 9. but reverse ka is point nine, right? razor nods.}
<C>__{razor}
<D>__{you catch on quick, man.}
<C>__{neo}
<A>__{"i know these symbols from the hacking trainer. but how come its so}
<D>__{hard to find them on the keyboard?"}
<C>__{trinity}
<A>__{"your brain knows what to do. but it has to associate characters with}
<D>__{your body."}
<C>__{razor}
<A>__{"its muscle memory, neo. think of the space bar and your thumbs nail it. because your thumbs have hit the space bar millions of times. but think about reverse ka, and your fingers dont hit automatically hit}
<D>__{the reverse key and the ka key in one shot."}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{where did these symbols come from, anyway?}
<C>__{razor}
<A>__{"most of it is from the old japanese. its katakana. see, the machines arent binary. no zero and one. theyre quantum based, so instead of an open close base of zero or one, open or closed, they use all}
<D>__{numbers between zero and one."}
<C>__{neo}
<A>__{"all numbers between zero and one. that could be an infinite number of}
<D>__{numbers."}
<C>__{razor}
<D>__{not could be, it is. neo is astounded.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{holy shit. how many calculations per second?}
<C>__{razor}
<A>__{"how many cps? well, thats kind of hard to estimate. put it this way: picture all the particles in the known universe. not just atoms, but}
<D>__{sub atomic particles that compose atoms."}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{ok. at last count that was what, a gazillion, right? two gazillion? razor barely smiles at the joke.}
<C>__{razor}
<A>__{"well, its up there. in any case, the number of calculations per second the matrix can perform is greater than the estimated number of}
<D>__{particles in the known universe."}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{woah.}
<C>__{trinity}
<A>__{"thats how they have the operating power to create entire worlds}
<D>__{within their pcs."}
<C>__{neo}
<A>__{"ok. thats why it looks like reality. they have the computing power}
<D>__{to create entire worlds."}
<C>__{razor}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{neo}
<A>__{"so, if we hack into the matrix, why cant we just change the code}
<D>__{while were at it?"}
<C>__{razor}
<A>__{"no, no. see, its not that simple. the machines, the programs that code, create, and maintain the matrix, the agents, they are code.}
<D>__{there are different types of agents, many work unseen with no}
<A>__{interaction in the matrix. then, there are the enforcers, the ones we}
<D>__{know all too well."}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{razor}
<A>__{"well, my point is, the machines code and recode the matrix by pure will. interaction with the matrix, the physical act of being there, by default, allows people to change their environment the matrix.}
<D>__{they move objects, make sound, affect cause."}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{like reality.}
<C>__{trinity}
<A>__{"almost. reality is unalterable. but the fabric of reality in the matrix can be rewoven. some can reach beyond normal cause. their affects on the matrix are deeper than average. they have learned to change it according to their needs. but they dont have total control. thats why we need operators like razor here. but you, you go further}
<D>__{than any of us can."}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{how?}
<A>__{razor stands and taps neos skull. he stretches, grabs a japanese style wooden sword, and, out of boredom, starts performing slow, precise kendo moves around the main deck as he talks.}
<C>__{razor}
<A>__{"the equipment you carry up here. youre a freak. a good freak. youre neural kinetics blast past those of average humans. this, combined with your ability to suspend disbelief, allow you to change the}
<D>__{reality of the matrix."}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{how did i end up as... a freak? razor practices the same strike a few times.}
<C>__{razor}
<A>__{"good question. the machines create people through cloning, since, obviously, no coppertops have physical sex. theoretically, all clones in the matrix are exactly the same as when the first clones. they}
<D>__{shouldnt be any different from normal, homegrowns."}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{ok, so how do you explain me?}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{"not just you. morpheus, myself. we were all born inside.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{well, what separates us from others?}
<C>__{trinity}
<A>__{"for the past 50 years or so, something has been happening to children in the matrix. theyve been mutating, changing in ways the machines never predicted. some seem to gain faster reflexes and strength.}
<D>__{others seem to have psychic powers."}
<A>__{razor looks up to see morpheus, hanging back as he listens. he comes forward.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{and others are able to change the reality of the matrix itself. he points to neo.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{discussing history, are we? razor shakes his head.}
<C>__{razor}
<A>__{"im trying to teach this fool some programming, man. hes stuck in}
<D>__{the 20^th century. hes got no skills, man. without us, hes helpless."}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{in the matrix, without him, were helpless.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{morpheus, can you tell us what the mission is now?}
<C>__{morpheus}
