<D>__{go.}
<A>__{the sound of heavy iron releasing as the walls start to separate, revealing we are inside the broken down truck.}
<C>__{clay }
<D>__{make the call.}
<A>__{jensen taps into the military emergency band. takes a breath, centers himself, then...}
<C>__{jensen}
<D>__{base one, this is cavalier 415! we have been in a collision with a civilian vehicle! carvey's dead an' freeman's hurt bad! he's messed up his neck! he can't move! oh god, it's horrible! we need medevac immediate! he's got kids, base one, he's got kids!}
<C>__{base one }
<D>__{roger, cavalier 415! we're scrambling a chopper, hang in there!}
<A>__{jensen, all smiles, looks up at clay.}
<C>__{jensen}
<D>__{robert de niro who?}
<A>__{pooch and roque have the four drugged soldiers laid out on the sand. all four are clearly breathing.}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{sleeping like babies.}
<C>__{roque}
<D>__{what about their ride?}
<A>__{clay steps off the trailer with a heavy duty air hoist.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{flip it.}
<A>__{tight shots of the air ram attached to the undercarriage of the humvee. the tires start to lift off the ground... higher... four pairs of hands start rocking the truck... pooch and jensen, on one side. quietly:}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{what do you think's up with that "don't call me colonel" stuff?}
<C>__{jensen}
<D>__{classic loss of identity. clay defined himself by his place in the military structure.}
<C>__{jensen }
<D>__{it was his way of measuring the good he did in the world. without it, he's just another loser like the rest of us.}
<A>__{pooch blinks, impressed. then:}
<C>__{jensen }
<D>__{you know there's a website where you can download mp3's of donkeys farting? how cool is that?}
<A>__{a final push... and the humvee flips. from jensen's radio:}
<C>__{base one }
<D>__{cavalier 415 this is medevac delta. be advised, we are airborne and in bound to your position!}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{all right, everyone get into character...}
