<L>__{interior night harlem subway station}
<A>__{a subway screeches by at full speed revealing a station platform somewhere in harlem. a man runs for his life in the deserted space. he's an african american male in his forties wearing a security guard uniform. he turns into an empty corridor, climbs a set of stairs towards the exit, but the gates are down and the station is closed. desperate and out of breath, he is forced to trace his way back, searching for an exit or a place to hide. he sees a door to the public restroom and runs inside.}
<L>__{interior night subway public restroom}
<A>__{the place is deserted as well. one of the mirrors is smashed while the others are covered by graffiti and dirt the neon lights are flickering, bringing the place in and out of the dark. the man checks each stall one at a time. his face lights up as he looks inside the last one }
<B>__{a small window above the toilet is just big enough for him to crawl through.}
<A>__{he steps onto the toilet seat but the window is shut too tight. after a brief struggle, he swings it open, only to discover a wall of bricks. panic returns to his eyes. he slowly opens the stall door, fearful of what could be waiting outside. a faint sound of shattering glass is heard. he quickly shuts the door, holding his breath. frozen. silence. his heart racing, he exits the stall in the direction of the sound. the place is empty. the room is revealed by flashes of flickering neon lights. he moves closer to the sinks and the spiderweb cracked mirror. his image is fragmented and deformed. it resembles a cubist portrait.}

<C>__{man }
<D>__{no, please don't...}
<A>__{he approaches and starts crying like a child. his head resting against the mirror, he pleads for his life. then, seeing the dirt and grime on the mirror, his behaving shifts to another extreme. he starts cleaning it frantically with his hands. too frantically a piece of the spiderweb cracked mirror falls on the ground. immediately, he bends down to pick it up but his reflection in the mirror remains standing in silence,}
<B>__{watching him.}
<A>__{looking up, the man realizes his reflection has become independent. a separate being... terrified, he slowly stands staring at his stationary double. the pointy and sharp piece of broken mirror in his hand reflects the neon lights just like a knife blade. his eyes turn cold with fear when his double in the mirror stabs itself deep in its throat! in reality, the man has not moved an inch, yet his throat rips open, releasing a river of blood. void of any facial expression, the man's reflection slices his jugular from end to end. in reality, the man chokes on his own blood which splatters on the mirror turning the image to a dark deep red.}

<A>__{on 38th street, just off of broadway, the mayflower has withstood the passage of time and the huge fire that forced it to shut down the damage from the fire is still noticeable on the facade of the building the fire appears to have started on the ground floor and seems to have spread all the way up to the top. some of the windows are shattered, while others are boarded up. what was once an impressive ornate building, a fine example of 1920's architecture standing on one of manhattan's most dynamic streets, now gives off a feeling of devastation and desolation. what is left of it is a mere ruin, a sort of neglected ghost ship, abandoned in the heart of the city.}
<L>__{interior day mayflower}
<A>__{the last beams of daylight shine through the broken windowpanes. inside the department store, everything has remained the same since the fire, as if time stood still. the display cases, the departments, the mannequins, and even the clothes are all burnt or blackened by the fire. a thick coat of soot covers the floor and rainwater drips down all over the place.}

<C>__{lorenzo }
<D>__{the company wants us to patrol the premises every couple of hours, but i do my rounds every three hours and that's more than enough. anyway, you'll see, there's not much going on. it's pretty calm around here.}
<A>__{ben follows lorenzo through the burnt display counters. he listens but his mind has drifted elsewhere. this place makes him uncomfortable. it's not only the lingering smell of a fire, but also a sense of death that hangs over it. the whistling of the wind through the store's old ventilation system sounds like faraway voices. ben and lorenzo appear at the top of the staircase of the 2nd floor.}
<C>__{lorenzo }
<D>__{here you go... men's department, or what's left of it anyway...}
<A>__{ben observes the surroundings yet another spectacle of devastation.}
<C>__{lorenzo }
<D>__{thank god you didn't show up any later. this place gives me the chills at night. ... no electricity, and all these mirrors... you know, i live in brooklyn near a jewish neighborhood, and when someone dies, they cover all the mirrors in their house. some say that it's just to renounce all vanity during the mourning period, but others say something else... they say it's to keep the soul of the dead from being trapped in the mirrors... believe it or not, there's always a bit of truth in any superstition. am i right?}
<A>__{amused and skeptical at the same time, ben contemplates the mirrors that surround him }
<C>__{lorenzo }

<D>__{why did he leave?}
<C>__{lorenzo}
<D>__{no idea. just didn't show up one night. i take it he's found a better opportunity somewhere else.}
<C>__{lorenzo }
<D>__{i'm not one to complain, but i never really liked him much... could never be bothered to say hello or at least ask "how are you doing?"... i mean, damn, do we work together as a team or what?! you, on the other hand, seem like a nice guy. how long has it been since you left the nypd?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{almost a year.}

<D>__{see you tomorrow.}
<A>__{lorenzo and lorenzo jr. exit the trailer. through the window, ben sees them walk out to the street. ben inspects the trailer scattered with knickknacks, the decoration of the place corresponds well with lorenzo's personality warmhearted and humble. the clock on the wall shows 7 p.m.... a long night lies ahead. ben grabs a flashlight and turns it on. the beam of light is dazzling }

<A>__{ entrance hall ground floor in the reflection of one of the grand mirrors in the entrance hall, we see ben come down the stairs. he stops for a moment, facing his reflection in the mirror. he fixes his collar and looks at himself in his new clothes not quite an nypd uniform... suddenly, his eyes freeze. intrigued, he comes closer to the mirror and leans forward a handprint, barely visible, on the ice cold surface. he touches it with the tip of his fingers and tries to rub it off, unsuccessfully. he picks up a rag from the ground, spits on the mirror, and rubs the mark fervently. the print remains. this confirms his hunch }

<A>__{by angling the flashlight, another handprint is revealed. another. and yet another the entire mirror is covered with handprints, just as if a crowd}

<A>__{as he looks back up in the mirror he sees the access door to}
<B>__{the basement opening...}
<A>__{ben turns around. his gaze freezes the access door to the basement is closed! yet, in the mirror, it continues to slowly screech open! ben swings his head back and forth, between the shut door in reality and the opened door in the mirror. what is happening? is he dreaming or hallucinating? ben walks backwards towards the basement door, keeping his eyes fixed on the mirror. as he goes to reach for the handle, he sees his reflection reaching for the handle of an invisible door! ben opens it }

<A>__{in the basement, the calm has been restored. ben is still crouching behind the sheltering wall of the mirror room. in the silence, he waits. he must establish beyond a doubt that it's all over. he aims his flashlight at the surface of the water everything seems to be back to normal. his reflection is deformed by the slight stir of the water, slowly becoming placid. ben steps over the rubble to enter the mirror room all the mirrors have been pulverized leaving behind only the metal cage that was holding them in place. the floor is covered with thousands of pieces of mirror floating in the water, shimmering in the shadows. the beam of the flashlight sweeps the room in search of anna, or her dead body nothing... ben inspects all the dark corners behind the metal structure the woman has vanished. he aims his flashlight at the ceiling. the beam of light instantly reveals a dark shape hanging above him it's her, or at least what is left of her a possessed, metamorphosed, human frame. she is barely recognizable. with her eyes rolled upward, her slashed face and her body pierced by the shards of glass, she looks like a demon, deprived}

<A>__{ben manages to pin the creature against the wall. "anna" spits blood in his face. he applies all his strength to immobilize her the shards of glass dig deeper into the elderly woman's flesh, which only seems to provide her an intense pleasure... "anna" froths at the mouth. her speech has become a deep, animalistic, incomprehensible gurgle. in an effortless movement, "anna" pushes him away. her demonic strength is ten times his. ben is merely a puppet, a rag doll that she sends flying into the air, only to crash violently against the brick walls... blood squirts onto the surface of the water. ben smashes into the wall separating the mirror room from the underground passageways. on the other side, he lands on the ground, in the dark. he strives to regain consciousness... ben takes advantage of the brief respite to pull out his gun but "anna" appears from the dark and, in a flash, she strikes a backhanded blow that sends the gun off into the air. she lifts ben up and throws him across the room. he rams into the wall. with the absence of light in the basement, ben is defenseless. he cannot see his assailant... ben is caught by the leg and dragged backwards. his hand struggles to catch on to anything that could hold him back. suddenly, under the water, his hand lands on the gun. he grabs it, turns onto his back, and fires point blank at "anna". the bullets go flying through her body, but they don't stop her. ben is being dragged. he manages to grab hold of one pipe after the other, trying to hold on, but the pipe gives way and breaks off from the wall, letting out a powerful jet of gas. once again, ben is sent flying down the tunnel. he struggles to get back on his feet apart from the sound of the flowing gas, a disturbing silence surrounds the subterranean passageways. ben makes out "anna's" silhouette, hiding behind the leaking gas pipe. with his bloodied face, ben is no longer the same man anymore something in his eyes has shifted. rage and violence have replaced the terror and dread. he is determined to put an end to the creature, no matter what happens. he slides the weapon in his belt and steps, with his bare hands, towards what once was "anna"... crouched over in the water, the demon looks up, ready to charge. ben takes another step forward with the same determination. the creature thrusts itself against him the clash is extremely violent. ben uses all his strength to keep his assailant's jaw at a distance. in a swift movement, ben turns around and impales "anna" on the broken gas pipe!}
