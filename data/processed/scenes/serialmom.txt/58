<A>__{dad is frantically searching through mom's stuff and finds a scrapbook which is filled page after page with newspaper clippings about famous mass murderers. he gasps in horror and then looks between mattress and box springs and finds a stack of letters and a few cassette tapes. he looks in shock at return address of first letter "richard speck, statesville correctional center, joliet, illinois 60434". he tears open envelope and out falls an 8xlo glossy photo of a naked richard speck with the inscription "to beverly. love, richard speck". shaking his head in horror, dad puts cassette in tape player and pushes play button. the voice on the tape booms out in bedroom, "beverly, it's me, ted bundy. it's late at night six days before my execution and it's lonely here on death row...". dad lunges for machine to push off button and accidentally turns on the radio.}
