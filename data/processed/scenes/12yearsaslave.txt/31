<L>__{exterior burch's dungeon yard day}
<A>__{sitting together out in the yard are clemens ray, john and solomon. over time they have drawn trustworthy enough to speak with one another. at the moment solomon is still trying to apply reason to the situation. randall wanders about in the background. as usual, he calls out for his "mama." by now, however, his calls should feel like little more than background noise.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{this can't stand. it is a crime. i believe now someone lay in wait for me. my drink was altered... we are free men. they have...they have no right to hold us.}
<A>__{solomon waits for a response from the others. they give none.}
<C>__{solomon }
<D>__{we need a sympathetic ear. if we have an opportunity to explain our situation }
<C>__{clemens}
<D>__{who in your estimation is that sympathetic ear?}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{the two men i journeyed with. i'm certain they're making inquires at this very moment.}
<C>__{clemens}
<D>__{i would be just as certain they are counting the money paid for delivering you to this place.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{they were not kidnappers. they were artists. fellow performers.}
<C>__{clemens}
<D>__{you know that? you know for certain who they were?}
<A>__{the fact is, solomon can't say for certain.}
<P>__{clemens (contâ€™d)}
<D>__{how i reckon the situation: whatever past we had...well, that's done now. the reality to come is us being transported southward. new orleans if i were to venture. after we arrive, we'll be put to market. beyond that... well, once in a slave state i suppose there's only one outcome.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{clemens}
<D>__{i don't say that to give you empty agitation, john...}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{for y'all. for y'all they ain't nothin' but that! but john was'n kidnapped. john bein' hold as debt, tha's all. massa pay his debt, and john be redeemed }
<C>__{clemens}
<D>__{boy, our masters will not come for us.}
<A>__{john is nearly beside himself with panic.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{now john's...john's sorry for y'all, but tha's how it be. where y'all goin', yah goin' witout john. massa take care of me. massa take care.}
<C>__{randall}
<D>__{mama!}
<A>__{all three men turn and look. at the moment randall doesn't call out emptily. at the door to the yard is burch along with two women. one in her late twenties; eliza. she is "arrayed in silk, with rings upon her fingers, and golden ornaments suspended from her ears." though a slave, eliza was a mistress and has to this point lived well. this is reflected in her airs and her speech. the other is a little girl, light in skin color, of about seven or eight. this is emily, randall's half sister. as she enters the yard eliza squeals with high delight, then breaks into tears of both sorrow and joy. clearly this is mother and child being reunited. as burch locks the yard door, eliza clutches randall. she is overcome with emotion.}
<C>__{eliza}
<D>__{my darling. my sweet, sweet baby.}
