<L>__{exterior charleston road day}
<A>__{marion and forty of his men, including gabriel, sit on their motionless horses in the middle of the road. there are a number of new faces among marion's men, among them ben rollins. gabriel is lost in thought.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{gabriel? are you asleep?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{we're low on salt. i should go to pembroke and get some.}
<C>__{billings}
<D>__{you got salt last week.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{oh, right.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{baking powder, we need baking powder.}
<C>__{billings}
<D>__{we've got plenty of baking powder. you went to pembroke and got five pounds two weeks ago.}
<A>__{gabriel sighs. they hear a sound approaching, then see two british wagons round a curve with a guard of only six redcoats, commanded by a redcoat sergeant. the redcoat sergeant signals stop.}
<C>__{redcoat sergeant}
<D>__{halt. look alive, boys.}
<A>__{the young redcoat privates nervously unshoulder their}
<B>__{muskets.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{sergeant, this road is closed. those wagons now belong to the continental army.}
<C>__{redcoat sergeant}
<D>__{ready arms! by twos!}
<A>__{marion's surprised by the sergeant's order.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{sergeant, there's no reason for you and your men to die. just leave the wagons and go.}
<C>__{redcoat sergeant}
<D>__{steady, boys...}
<A>__{marion sighs and lets loose with a piercing whistle. the underbrush parts and more of marion's men show themselves, muskets leveled at the outnumbered redcoats.}
<C>__{redcoat sergeant}
<D>__{this is the king's highway and i advise you and your men to make way.}
<P>__{(to his men)}
<D>__{prepare to fire.}
<A>__{marion exchanges a look with rev. oliver who, like marion, doesn't want to kill these men. seeing no other option, marion turns to give the order, then stops, hearing a faint barely detectable, rumbling sound... a moment later brother joseph hears it as well... horses hooves, lots of them, growing louder by the second, thundering toward them from the road behind the british wagons... then, the sound of more horses, coming in fast on both flanks.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{it's a trap...}
<A>__{the canvas sides of the british wagons are thrown up and dozens of redcoats, armed with muskets, spill out... marion's unmounted men run to their horses, leaping into their saddles... then green dragoons appear, galloping down the wooded slopes on both flanks, astonishing horsemen, weaving through the trees without slacking their pace, swords drawn, pistols primed...}
<C>__{redcoat sergeant}
<D>__{fire!}
<A>__{a thunderous volley erupts from the redcoat infantry, killing several of marion's men... marion's men fire back from their bucking mounts, most of their shots going awry... behind the british wagons, a huge detachment of green dragoons appears, tarleton among them...}
<B>__{marion sees the dragoons but not tarleton himself...}
<A>__{marion and his men spur their mounts, taking off down the road in the opposite direction... the flanking bodies of dragoons gallop out of the woods, joining the main body, riding in hard pursuit...}
