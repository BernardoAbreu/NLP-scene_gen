<A>__{at the end of the space a rough hewn wooden ladder leads to another block of cell corridors four stories up. years of damp air have warped the ladder. ripley leads the way, torch in her left hand. they climb...}
<L>__{interior end of prison corridor fourth level night}
<A>__{dark. ripley is the first one up. she raises her torch and heads down the new corridor alone. the cells here have no doors. she holds her torch in one an old skeleton sits in quiet contemplation.}
<B>__{at the ladder}
<A>__{john is just climbing off, anthony right behind him. anthony is winded. he reaches up for a helping hand. john looks back and sees that ripley has moved ahead without them, then reaches down to help anthony. their hands clasp anthony has a "vision" he is seemingly standing in an open field, sheep grazing peacefully at his side. suddenly he is attacked by a horde of medieval demons. fish faced demons. man headed bird demons. they fly about him, grab hold of his limbs. the sheep nearest him opens it's mouth to reveal a horde of razor sharp fangs, sinks them into his ankle anthony screams !}
<B>__{ripley}
<A>__{down the corridor hears the scream, turns back sees anthony fighting with himself, struggling against john's grasp }
<B>__{anthony}
<A>__{balanced precariously on the top of the ladder in the real world as he fights against the demons in his android mind he jerks pulls his left ankle out of the grasp of the demon sheep off the ladder forty foot drop waiting below him...}
<B>__{john}
<A>__{struggles to keep his death grip on anthony's hand. it's all that keeps anthony from falling back down the shaft }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{jesus christ. ripleeeee !}
<A>__{he pulls with all his might...}
<B>__{anthony}
<A>__{sees a horrible bird demon grasping his hand in its beak biting through his wrist. he waves his staff in the air he aims for its head: crack ! whacks john's hand with his staff john howls in pain lets go anthony teeters back on one foot, arms waving in the air ripley's hands shoot out grab anthony's cassock stop his fall. anthony's eyes open wide at the sight of this new horror a terrible, wet, black cable armed creature that's latched itself onto his cassock long, shiny head. ripley has become the alien. whack! anthony hits the creature with his staff hits ripley on the head. whack! again. in the face. john tries to take hold of anthony's staff arm whack! the cane whips against the side of his head, knocking him back. ripley sets her feet and pulls on anthony's cassock opens her mouth grunts anthony sees the terrible alien open it's maw to devour him. whack! his staff connects with the bridge of ripley's nose. she sees flashes of light loses her balance pitches forward, starts to go over with anthony john grabs them! wraps his arms around the struggling pair and like a sumo wrestler lifts and falls backwards carrying the three of them into the corridor whumph! they land on the floor in a heap. anthony continues to flail about ripley and john pin him to the floor between them. finally, the vision leaves him. he loses consciousness.}
<B>__{john}
<A>__{breathing heavy opens his eyes he's staring right into ripley's face. less than an inch away. he's laying on top of her. she's breathing heavy too. a long, uncomfortable moment.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you're welcome.}
<A>__{they roll off each other. her hand goes up to her nose. blood.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i'm all right.}
<A>__{john reaches into his bag, withdraws a small cotton bag.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{hold this against your nose. it'll stop the flow.}
<A>__{she looks over at him questioningly.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i'm a doctor.}
<A>__{she holds the small bag against her nose. the bleeding stops. they move over to anthony try to help him to his feet. he shakes them off.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{no please. just let me sit. awhile.}
<A>__{he rubs his temples. white, milk like sweat runs down his cheek.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{damn it.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{the reason i'm down here.}
<A>__{john points to his own eyes.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{visions.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{dreams.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{androids can't dream...}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{that's probably what they thought when they built me. but my brain is cyber organic patterned after the human brain it functions the same way a human brain does. it accumulates random images and sensations during waking hours, but unlike the human brain that sloughs them off during sleep }
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{androids don't sleep.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{right. maybe they've fixed this on later models, but i don't. do you know what happens to the human brain when it is deprived of sleep? it starts to run off the dreams while you're awake, as hallucinations. same thing with me. for twenty years i absorbed data on this planetoid. a little after we lost contact with earth the visions started. they thought i was insane. i had to explain that it was because i was an android. they liked that even less.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{what did you see?}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{what i always see. images of monsters. demons.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{they're portents. they stand for an evil yet to come.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{just images i've absorbed from those old books and have no way to get rid of.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i saw the inside of your cell.}
<C>__{anthony}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{my head is full of them. i try to get them out any way i can.}
<A>__{his eyelids droop.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you need sleep.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{i know that. i will settle for rest.}
<A>__{he closes his eyes. ripley recovers the torch.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{stay with him.}
<A>__{ripley tried to stand john takes her arm, pulls her down.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no. we all need rest. you especially.}
<A>__{ripley considers him.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{doctor's orders.}
<A>__{she smiles and sits.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{besides, you see what happens when you get ahead of us. we should stay together.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{all right. he's still above us, anyway.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i've faced this evil twice before i guess i've gotten sensitive to it }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you're really a doctor?}
<A>__{john pats his canvas bag.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{see my bag?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{what's that book?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{just a book.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i don't buy "just a book" from a guy who says we can't leave the planet without the library.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{it's just... a medical book i might need.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{you don't have any food in there, do you?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{only if you can eat bandages.}
<A>__{ripley rubs her midsection.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{in a few hours that's going to sound good. going in and out of suspended animation christ i probably haven't eaten in a year.}
<C>__{anthony}
<P>__{(without opening eyes)}
<D>__{you should've eaten the bread.}
<C>__{ripley and john}
<D>__{rest!}
<A>__{ripley lets her head loll back against the wall. closes her eyes. time passes. her brow knits. john sees this.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you all right?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{aces.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you weren't hurt when i landed on you? bruised a rib?}
<A>__{he reaches over and puts his hands beneath her cassock. feels her midsection. his hands are warm.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{are you sure you're a doctor?}
<A>__{he withdraws his hands.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{sort of. my father passed on when we first came here. the abbey's physician father anselm took me in. he really raised me }
<P>__{(pause)}

<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{you burned yourself on the escape pod.}
<A>__{her hands on his makes him feel...uncomfortable.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{thank you, i guess.}
<A>__{they look into each other's eyes }
<D>__{anthony o s you should've eaten the bread.}
<A>__{ripley, embarrassed, releases his hands. looks at anthony. he's trying to stand.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{enough rest. there's beasties afoot.}
<A>__{they start into...}
<B>__{a narrow corridor}
<A>__{ceiling so low their torches must be held out in front of them. ripley makes an effort not to move faster than the two monks.}
