<C>__{ada}
<D>__{no. pot blue or green. red.}
<A>__{ada pulls a red key from under her lab coat, snaps the chain on her neck, and holds it out to chris.}
<C>__{ada }
<D>__{i took it from an umbrella agent assigned to us here. he died... like all the rest.}

<D>__{stand up? against powers that have... ruled the world since before we were born? we will only be...eliminated. or locked away someplace else. i'd rather die here. knowing that the virus has died with me .}
