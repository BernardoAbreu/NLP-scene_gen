<L>__{exterior bear creek village night}
<A>__{the sordid little village the feds first drove through sits sleepy on the rim of sunrise. a dog barks hollow as the crow horse motorcycle chutters down and coasts up in front of one of the little homes rundown but it has a satellite dish and a decent car like so many. the le baron pulls up behind it.}
<L>__{interior le baron night}
<A>__{crow horse walks over to ray's window, his jeans and boots muddy. no one speaks for a long moment, the night filled by crickets. and that one dog.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{this clear moon's house?}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{yeah. it's time to beat the drum. you better wait here. he don't trust the white man.}
<A>__{crow horse crosses the street. ray sits there, and he looks almost hurt by this statement. but he is the white man. but he is indian. he lets a long breath escape, rubs at a temple. he takes out a smoke. tries to light it. his hands are shaking too badly. but he gets it lit, and sits tense, looking in his rearview.}
