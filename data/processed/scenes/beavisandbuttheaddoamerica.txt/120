<A>__{agents rush down the business streets. people are in a panic. it's like an invasion. angle on elite motor lodge on b&b's tv set as agents rush by, knocking it over with a crash.}

<A>__{guitar in hand, van driessen sings:}
<C>__{van driessen}
<D>__{she flies so gracefully, over rocks, trees and sand. soaring over cliffs and gently floating down to land. she proudly lifts her voice to sound her mating call. and soon her mate responds by singing... "caw, caw, caw." come with me, lesbian seagull. settle down and rest with me...}
<A>__{suddenly dozens of a.t.f. agents crash into the room. the door bashes in, knocking van driessen down hard and crushing his guitar. flemming enters. behind him, mcvicker.}
<D>__{mcvicker uh...uh...uh that's him. he's their teacher.}
<C>__{van driessen}
<D>__{what's going on here?}
<C>__{flemming}
<D>__{i will ask the questions. are these your students?}
<A>__{he shows a picture of b&b.}
<C>__{van driessen}
<D>__{i assume you're a government agent. i would think you would know there's something in this country called due process.}
<C>__{flemming}
<D>__{that's about the kind of talk i'd expect from the guy who taught these two. take this scum away.}
<C>__{van driessen}
<D>__{i believe i'm supposed to be read my miranda rights...}
<A>__{an agent interrupts, punching van driessen in the gut. he's taken away. flemming turns menacingly to mcvicker.}
<D>__{mcvicker i...i...i always knew they were no good. i... i... i hate them!}

<C>__{bork}
<D>__{we've run a sample through the national criminal sperm bank and come up with two possible genetic matches for a father.}
