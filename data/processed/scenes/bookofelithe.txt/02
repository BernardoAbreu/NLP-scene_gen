<A>__{eli emerges from the treeline onto the cracked and ruptured asphalt. lined by more of those ghostly, stripped bare trees. he sniffs the air, breathing it in. checks the road in both directions. deserted. a few yards away is the rusted, burned out chassis of a car. he heads toward it. the car rests half on the road, half in the adjacent ditch. stripped of its tires and engine. in the driver's seat is a mummified body. a bullet hole piercing its forehead. eli regards the body dispassionately. tries the door handle but it's jammed. he yanks on it harder and eventually wrenches it open. he leans in and checks the man's feet. they're bare. no shoes or socks. eli curses under his breath. he leaves the car behind and heads on down the road. as he walks away, we see that the sole of one of his boots has worn loose, held in place now only by a rubber band.}
