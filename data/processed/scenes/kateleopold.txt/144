<A>__{leo, 24 and his bride take to the floor for the first time as husband and wife and are greeted with applause. kate, older, beautiful, hair cut short, looks on in wonder. charlie, standing with patrice and their 6 blonde children, approaches kate and leads her to the dance floor.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{he's so young, charlie.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{he's old enough.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{look at that idiotic expression on his face.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{he's happy.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{of course he's happy. all weddings are happy. it's the living together afterwards that causes all the trouble.}
<A>__{julia carlson, under dressed, over anxious, enters the banquet hall. she stands at the back of the large room, searching. couples fill the dance floor. across the expansive room, over the tops of heads, charlie and kate bob amongst the guests. leo cuts in. as they spin, in the briefest of seconds, kate spots carlson. she pales. they turn. kate peers over leo's shoulder. her eyes lock with julia's. julia nods with purpose. kate holds onto leo tightly, not wanting to let go. she buries her head in his chest.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{oh, you're so young... i love you, leo. always remember that...}
