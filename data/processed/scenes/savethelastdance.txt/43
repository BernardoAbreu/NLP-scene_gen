<B>__{morning}
<A>__{patrick, chenille, snookie straggle through the dreary jungle of concrete lawns and blighted high rises on the way to school. it's quiet now but the scars of past battles, like the bombed out police substation on one of its corners, are evident everywhere.}
<C>__{snookie}
<D>__{i need a date }
<C>__{chenille}
<D>__{why? your hand busy?}
<C>__{snookie}
<D>__{ for the prom. and if it wasn't for that kinda undue attitude, you could be the lucky girl, chenille. my personal prom queen. i can see us now.}
<C>__{chenille}
<D>__{you must be lookin' in your dreams.}
<A>__{snookie glances at patrick. he's somewhere else.}
<C>__{snookie}
<D>__{help me, man. defend me.}
<C>__{patrick}

<P>__{(wishfully thinking)}
<D>__{i probably coulda been a doctor too. if i hadn't got left back that time.}
<C>__{chenille}
<D>__{that time? what? fifth and sixth grade don't count?}
<A>__{patrick finally laughs. then his face changes. becomes serious. he hops a low wall, keeps in stride above them. they continue on like this, the ruins of their world in the b.g. behind them.}
