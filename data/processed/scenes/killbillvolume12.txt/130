<L>__{interior pai mei's private chamber}
<A>__{pai mei's pov: we see through pei mei's pupils, through a sheer scarlet scrim that hangs down in front of his sitting area. the bride enters the room. she approaches the old man, reaches the edge of his sitting area in front of the scrim, lowers to one knee and bows her head. from here on end, whenever english is spoken by the bride, or every once in awhile by pai mei, it will be spoken in english in live synch sound. however, whenever mandarin is supposedly spoken, it comes out of their mouths as dubbed english like in a 70's shaw brothers chop socky flick.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{teacher, i am unworthy to be your student }
<A>__{pai mei is still unseen.}
<C>__{pai mei's voice}
<D>__{your mandarin is lousy. i can't understand a single word you say. it causes my ears discomfort. you are not to speak unless spoken to. do you understand mandarin any better than you speak it?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{i speak japanese very well }
<C>__{pai mei's voice}
<D>__{i didn't ask if you speak japanese, or mongolian, for that matter. i asked if you understand mandarin?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{a little, i am still learning.}
<C>__{pai mei's voice}
<D>__{you are here to learn the mysteries of kung fu, not linguistics. if you can't understand me, i will communicate with you like i would a dog. when i yell, when i point, when i beat you with my stick!}
<A>__{her head remains bowed, eyes to the floor.}
