<A>__{looking down the central shaft of hometree, 80 meters to the ground. villagers are ant like. jake tries to keep up with neytiri as she leaps up the core trunk like a lemur. he climbs the last section, arriving out of breath beside her. she leads him outside, onto a large branch. through gaps in the foliage jake can see other great trees scattered across the landscape, like enormous umbrellas above the rainforest. neytiri strides out across the branch toward some kind of structure a web made of thick woven fiber. dark shapes clinging to it stir with a leathery rustling sound. neytiri makes a series of trills and clicks. one of the shapes moves toward them, emerging into a shaft of sunlight. a huge mountain banshee. much larger than the forest banshees, this thing is taller than a na'vi with a 10 meter wingspan. a leathery fwhoop, like the crack of sails, as it alights on the branch right in front of her.}

<D>__{holy shit.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{do not look in her eye.}
<A>__{neytiri feeds it a large scrap of meat, which it snatches and gulps down. she murmurs to it and strokes its neck. it lets out a signature shriek, and some of the others in the shadows nearby answer. neytiri flip catches her queue and gently connects it to the banshee's antenna. it shivers and stretches its wings as the neural connection is made.}

<D>__{ikran is not horse. once shahaylu is made, ikran will fly with only one hunter in the whole life.}
<A>__{she climbs smoothly onto the animal's back.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{to become taronyu hunter you must choose your own ikran. and he must choose you.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{when?}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{when you are ready.}
<A>__{the banshee shivers with anticipation.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{heeyaaahh!}
<A>__{jake ducks as the great wings explode open and the banshee drops off the branch. it swoops down across the forest canopy, banks hard, lets out a cry and beats its wings in a power climb. completing the bank, neytiri directs the banshee into a close swooping flyby, and jake instinctively ducks. on neytiri flying in perfect fusion with her winged mount, the rainforest rolling beneath her.}
