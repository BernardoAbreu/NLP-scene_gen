<A>__{officer edgar paski stands on the porch with his note pad open. he faces graham and merrill.}
<C>__{officer paski}
<D>__{you can't describe him at all? don't you think that's find of odd?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{it does seem kind of odd doesn't it?}
<C>__{officer paski}
<D>__{i don't know whether to look for a midget or a }
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{he definitely wasn't a midget.}
<C>__{officer paski}
<D>__{okay.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so he was tall?}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(to merrill)}
<D>__{i would say so.}
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{probably.}
<C>__{officer paski}
<D>__{over six feet?}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{it was very dark.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{yes, it was.}
<C>__{officer paski}
<D>__{we've established that.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{just tell me about his clothing then.}
<A>__{graham and merrill stare at edgar paski.}
<C>__{officer paski}
<D>__{was he wearing a scottish kilt or jeans?}
<A>__{they keep staring. edgar closes his pad.}
<C>__{officer paski}
<D>__{let me ask you two something. don't be embarrassed by the answer. it is possible... just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around? you said you went in opposite directions.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it. but we couldn't see him. he stayed mostly in the shadows. all we could make out was movement.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but i will tell you something with absolute certainty. there was someone watching our house last night. he was looking in my children's windows and i want you to find him edgar.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i need you to take this seriously, just incase, it is something serious.}
<A>__{the three men stand in the doorway. edgar opens his pad.}
<C>__{officer paski}
<D>__{i apologize.}
<A>__{morgan walks up to the front door. he holds up a baby monitor.}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{can i use bo's old baby monitor as a walkie talkie?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{it needs batteries.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{edgar, come inside.}
<A>__{the three men follow morgan into the house. they pass through the family room where bo stands at the television. she is staring at the screen. on the screen is aerial}
<B>__{footage from a helicopter. the footage is of a large field with enormous circles and diamonds carved into its crops.}
<A>__{bo changes the channel. she finds a cartoon. she sits down on the sofa. morgan and the men, can't see the screen, and move into the}
<B>__{kitchen.}
<C>__{officer paski}
<D>__{how certain are you, that this was a male?}
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{i don't know any girls can run like that.}
<A>__{graham opens one of the cabinets and pulls down some batteries. he hands them to morgan.}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{these are d's; i need double a's.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i have some upstairs.}
<A>__{graham starts out of the kitchen.}
<C>__{officer paski}
<D>__{i don't know merrill. i've seen some of those women on the olympics. they could out run me easy.}
<A>__{they all move into the}
<B>__{family room.}
<A>__{bo watches cartoons. the cartoon music and cartoon prat}
<B>__{falls fills the room.}
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{this guy got on the roof in like a second.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{bo, can you turn down the volume until officer paski leaves?}
<A>__{bo nods and moves to the television. the pack of men follow graham up the}
<B>__{stairs.}
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{that roof is over ten feet high.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{he's telling you the truth, edgar. whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high.}
<A>__{they arrive on the landing and follow graham into his bedroom. he moves into his}
<B>__{bathroom.}
<A>__{they all move in with him.}
<C>__{officer paski}
<D>__{they got women's high jumping in the olympics. they got these scandinavian women who could jump clean over me.}
<A>__{graham takes the clock radio from the sink. tries to open the back.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{shoot, it needs a screw driver. i have double a's in here.}
<A>__{graham waves the radio. the men and morgan move out of the bathroom.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i know you're making a point edgar. i just don't know what it is.}
<A>__{they moves down the stairs.}
<C>__{officer paski}
<D>__{yesterday afternoon, an out of town woman stopped by the diner and started yelling and cussing cause they didn't have her favorite cigarettes at the vending machine. scared a couple of customers. no one's seen her since... my point is, we don't know anything about the person you saw. we should just keep all possibilities available.}
<A>__{they move through the family room. bo's cartoon is replaced by a special report news icon.}
<C>__{bo}
<D>__{dad, where's the remote?}
<A>__{bo starts looking around the couch. graham stops before entering the kitchen. the group stops with him. he looks at bo searching the couch. he walks over to the television. there are three glasses of water on the tv set. he stands next to the set. doesn't see what's on the screen.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{bo, you're too old to still be doing this. the rule is, you take a glass of water, you finish it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now what's wrong with this one?}
<A>__{bo stops looking through the sofa cushions and looks to her father. looks at the glass.}
<C>__{bo}
<D>__{there's dust in it.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{this one?}
<C>__{bo}
<D>__{a hair.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{this one?}
<C>__{bo}
<D>__{morgan took a sip. it has his amoebas in it.}
<A>__{beat. bo turns back to her search. graham tucks the clock radio under his arm and collects the three glasses. he heads towards the kitchen.}
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{excluding the possibility that a female scandinavian olympian was running around outside our house last night, what else is a possibility?}
<C>__{officer paski}
<D>__{i'm not done asking questions and i don't appreciate the sarcasm.}
<A>__{they follow graham and morgan through the swinging door into the kitchen. graham puts the glasses in the sink with a group of other half filled water glasses and opens the drawer to pull out a screwdriver. he starts opening the clock radio.}
<C>__{officer paski}
<D>__{do you have anyone who might have a grudge or something against you? maybe a church member, who might not have liked the fact, that you left the church?}
<A>__{graham looks at edgar.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{officer paski}
<D>__{do you owe anybody money? you can tell me off the record if you need too.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{morgan hands graham the baby monitor and graham starts replacing the batteries.}
<C>__{officer paski}
<D>__{is anything missing?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{graham hands morgan the monitor. he turns it on. there is a}
<B>__{static crackle with spikes of sound.}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{it's still making the noises. it's broken.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{it's old morgan.}
<A>__{morgan heads out of the kitchen.}
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{listen, i was out of line with that whole female scandinavian olympian thing.}
<A>__{edgar nods.}
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{it's just that, i'm pretty strong and pretty fast. and i was running as fast as i could. and this guy...}
<P>__{(embarrassed smile)}
<D>__{he was just toying with us.}
<A>__{beat. merrill walks out of the kitchen. graham watches edgar think it over.}
