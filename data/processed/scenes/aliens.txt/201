<L>__{interior cargo bay}
<A>__{newt screams as the hurricane airstream sucks her across the floor toward the airlock. bishop, torn virtually in two, his pastalike internal organs whipped by the wind, grips a stanchion and reaches desperately for newt as she slides past him. he catches her arm and hangs on as she dangles, doll like, in the airblast.}
<L>__{interior loading lock}
<A>__{the alien seizes ripley's ankle. she locks her arms around a ladder rung, feels them almost torn out of their shoulder sockets. the door opens farther, all of space yawning below. the loader tumbles clear, falling away. it drags the alien, still clutching one of ripley's lucky hi tops, into the depths of space. its shriek fades, it gone. with all her strength ripley fights the blasting air, crawling over the lip of the inner doorway. she releases the override from a second panel. the inner doors close. the turbulent air eddies and settles. she lies on her back, drained of all strength. gasping for breath. weakly she turns her head, seeing bishop still holding newt by the arm. encrusted with his own vanilla milkshake blood. bishop gives her a small, grim smile.}
