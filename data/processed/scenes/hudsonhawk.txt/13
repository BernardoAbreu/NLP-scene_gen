<A>__{hawk stares mournfully at a black and white photo of a monkey sized chalk outline on a city street. behind him, alex pulls out blueprints from the black bag. sinatra's "witchcraft" blares on the radio....}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{hmmmm.....}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{yo pandora, quit hummm ing... look at this.}
<A>__{hawk is rummaging through stockpiled remnants of an old, "true" bar. round lamps, tacky mirrors, pictures of hawk and the regs at the bar. managing a weary smile, hawk lifts a ship steering wheel, while alex puts on a pair of granny classes and pulls out blueprints.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{it's captain bob's steering wheel! remember when the captain.....}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.}
<A>__{hawk nervously picks up a rubik's cube and holds it behind his back. he brings it back around, completed. sighing, hawk drops the cube and rubs his scalp. alex starts rubbing his stomach. they pace in pre job syncopation and speak rapid fire.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{the safe's a simpson 71. last time i played the game, simpson only had a 40.}
<C>__{alex}

<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{this isn't funny. i'm not into this. i...}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{there goes five seconds...my record's eighteen.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{you're not...listening!}
<A>__{out of annoyance, hawk breaks out of the cuffs and violently throws them at alex, who sits down a little wounded.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{i'm sorr goddamn mario brothers. goddamn gates. goddamn rutherford auction house. by the way, how many seconds?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{rutherford auction... that name...}
<A>__{alex jumps up excitedly and then convulses in pain.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{alex!}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{don't wet your diapers. i will have to change them. "witchcraft." what's the running time?}
<A>__{alex flops down behind a work table before a wallfull of drawings of different kinds of vaults. he sets himself up for an insulin injection.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{3:48. i can't get you involved, man. this is my sewage and...}
<P>__{(re drawings)}
<D>__{god, you love all this, don't you, you bastard. haven't you ever heard of stamp collecting, or curling?}
<A>__{hawk leans in and administers the shot of insulin to alex.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i'm in. have you seen the public service announcements for diabetes. we can ride horses, play lacrosse, and knock off auction houses. i got a plan. you won't have to hail cesar or gates.}
<A>__{hawk collapses next to alex, resigned to his fate.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{i'm a bum.}
