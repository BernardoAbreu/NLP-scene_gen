<L>__{interior roadhouse night}
<A>__{frances and harry sit at a table cluttered with empty glasses. the jukebox plays, a few couples dance. frances is gulping down a tall scotch.}

<C>__{harry}

<D>__{hey! another shot for the lady and a double for me!}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{what a man!}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{hey, you're a good quarter horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(hoisting her glass)}
<D>__{to quarter horses.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{no. to thoroughbreds.}
<A>__{he knocks back his drink.}
<B>__{the jukebox}
<A>__{a hand puts a nickel in, and we hear bing crosby singing "love is so terrific." we pan across the dance floor, where harry and frances are dancing.}
<C>__{bing's voice}
<D>__{love is so terrific such a funny feeling makes you want to cuddle and coo...}
<A>__{frances squeals with delight when she hears the song. she holds harry forcefully and starts to lead him around the floor. harry starts to sing along:}
<D>__{bing & harry makes you sentimental, makes you kinda gentle ouch!}
<P>__{(frances pinches harry)}
<D>__{terrific thing.}
<A>__{around them an infection is spreading: all the women are leading their men. for an instant it is magical, liberating... she leans her head against his shoulder.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{why are you always leaving me, harry?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{you should stickaround sometimes. look out for me.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{look, frances, i'm only gonna ask this one time. i mean it. i swear after this, i will never ask again: will you marry me?}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(after a long pause)}
<D>__{i know a thing or two about marriage. you... you understand me more than anyone, harry... maybe even more than mama. but... you're too important to me. i'd fail you. i don't know how or why, but i would. and that's a chance i just can't take. do you understand?}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(a bitter smile)}
<D>__{well... i will act like i do until i do.}
<A>__{they are silent for a moment.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{there's just one more thing.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{will you marry me?}
<A>__{she laughs happily. he joins her, but his seems a little forced. she leans her head on his shoulder and holds him tight. they dance...}
