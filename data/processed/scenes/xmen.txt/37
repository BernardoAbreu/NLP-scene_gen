<A>__{logan hears footsteps and quickly does a one eighty back down the hallway. he turns a corner, hugging the wall. he halts. a large oak door stands down the hall. he smells something, taking in a deep breath, his head cocking to the side listening. he turns and looks behind him. more foot steps. someone is about to enter the hall. he turns again, ready to run the other way when he sees the shadows of two more people coming from the other direction. logan is trapped. he lunges for the large oak door and bursts through.}
