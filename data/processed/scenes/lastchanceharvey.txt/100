<L>__{interior reception top table night}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{so without further ado, i'd like to propose a toast to susan for making my friend scott complete.}
<A>__{the audience whoop and clap. scott gives his best man a hug. pete stands...}
<C>__{pete }
<D>__{and now ladies and gentlemen. it is the turn of the father of the bride to say a few words. pete (mc) (cont'd) and tonight that task will be carried out by the very charming and distinguished brian.}
<A>__{more clapping as brian stands. kate glances at harvey, who blushes.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{well, that's quite some speech josh. quite something to follow. but i shall try...}
<A>__{harvey suddenly stands and clears his throat.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{um... excuse me...}
<A>__{nobody really hears. he picks up his glass and a spoon and begins to tap it. people stir and turn to harvey. brian comes to a stop. jean looks on furious. silence.}
<C>__{harvey }
<D>__{sorry brian... sorry to interrupt.}
<A>__{everyone stares at harvey. silence.}
<C>__{harvey }
<D>__{but you see i can't just sit hear and watch somebody else give my baby girl away. susan's my daughter and i'm her father. not the best, by far, but her father all the same.}
<A>__{a waiter brings harvey a microphone.}
<C>__{harvey }
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{it's arrival slightly throws him.}
<C>__{harvey }
<D>__{um... i should have prepared something but... i guess it reminds me of a joke...}
<A>__{harvey continually knocks the mic against his chest, causing terrible feedback.}
<C>__{harvey }
<D>__{sorry. um...}
<A>__{then harvey drops the mic. jean stands up.}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{for god's sake harvey, don't make a scene.}
<A>__{silence. harvey stares out at the party. they all stare back at him. he glances down at kate who smiles back. harvey lifts the microphone up off the table and raises it to his lips.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{no jean. i want to make a scene. you know. i'm tired of being embarrassed.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{if we can't make a scene on the day of our daughter's wedding, then when can we? i want to make a scene. i want to shout! i wanna tell the world how lucky it is to have our suzie in it!}
<C>__{someone in the crowd}
<D>__{yeah!}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{i wanna tell scott, how damn lucky he is!}
<C>__{uncle fred}
<D>__{hear, hear!}
<A>__{people start to clap.}
<C>__{harvey}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{and also if he ever hurts her, i know people in north of london.}
<A>__{laughter.}
<C>__{harvey }
<D>__{seriously though. scott, i swear you have found in susan a bright and passionate person. and a loyal friend.}
<C>__{congregation}
<D>__{hear, hear!}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{and i can see from the way she looks at you. from the way she is with you, that she is...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<C>__{harvey }
<D>__{...happy.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and i thank you and welcome you to the family.}
<A>__{harvey and scott share a look. the room applauds loudly.}
<C>__{harvey }
<D>__{and finally, if i can linger a moment longer. i would like to turn it back over to brian, with a note of... gratitude.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{thank you for being there for my baby girl. thank you for being there, when i wasn't.}
<A>__{beat. brian nods to harvey, before standing and raising his glass.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{if you would all please join harvey and i, in a toast.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{to susan and scott.}
<C>__{congregation}
<D>__{susan and scott!}
<A>__{everyone claps loudly. susan shares a gentle smile with her father. harvey sits and looks at kate anxiously. kate smiles and nods.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{well done.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{really?}
<A>__{she indicates to the rest of the table. harvey turns to their now animated young neighbours, who all sit clapping.}
