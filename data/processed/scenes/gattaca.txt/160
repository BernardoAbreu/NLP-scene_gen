<B>__{crew members.}
<A>__{jerome's heart sinks as he recognizes lamar, greeting the crew for one final unexpected substance test. his colleagues groan good naturedly but it is clearly far more than an inconvenience to jerome. he looks towards the door he has just entered but there is no way back. one by one the crew are ushered behind a screen. before he can think of a way out, it is jerome's turn. he enters the cubicle.}

<D>__{what's this, lamar?}
<C>__{lamar}
<D>__{new policy.}
<A>__{from behind, we see jerome unzip his fly. however for once jerome does not urinate on cue unused to operating his own equipment in front of the physician.}
<C>__{lamar}
<P>__{(intrigued by the out of character discharge)}
<D>__{flight got you nervous?}
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{there's a problem, lamar.}
<C>__{lamar}
<P>__{(apparently not listening)}
<D>__{did i ever tell you about my son, jerome? he's a big fan of yours. he wants to apply here.}
<A>__{jerome realizes he has no choice. resigned to his fate, he begins to fill the cup.}

<D>__{ unfortunately my son's not all that they promised. but then, who know what he could do.}
<A>__{lamar takes the cup from jerome in his gloved hand. jerome anxiously watches his sample poured into the analyzer. confirming jerome's worst fears, the face of 20 year old vincent appears on the computer screen. however lamar does not look at the screen. he stares jerome in the eye.}
<C>__{lamar}
<D>__{for future reference }
<P>__{(a brief glance to where jerome has just zipped his fly)}
<D>__{ righthanded men don't hold it with their left. it's just one of those things.}

<C>__{lamar}
<P>__{(knowing smile)}
<D>__{have a safe trip, vincent.}
<A>__{jerome exits up a long enclosed escalator, realizing that lamar has known all along.}
