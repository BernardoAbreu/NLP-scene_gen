<L>__{interior the houses of parliament, lobby corridor night}
<A>__{an hour later the house is empty except for a few straggling mps hurrying home. an exhausted disraeli stands in the corridor with stanley.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{we're going to lose.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{you can't know that for sure.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. we need help.}
<P>__{(long beat)}
<D>__{where is the old girl?}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{mrs brown.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{it's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction. she's never been less popular.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{in the press, perhaps.}
<P>__{(holding up punch)}
<D>__{but she's sold more copies of her highland journal in three months than punch will ever sell in a year. time to wheel her out.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{she's refusing to leave balmoral.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{what's her excuse this time?}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{the princess louisa is too ill to move. frankly, the queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you're smiling.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{i was trying to imagine "rather upset."}
<A>__{the elderly prelate, dean wellselly, hurries in through the lobby doors. disraeli puts on a welcoming smile.}
<C>__{dean wellselly}
<D>__{forgive me, gentlemen. i'm late.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{not at all, dean. good of you to spare the time.}
<C>__{dean wellselly}
<D>__{i came as quickly as i could.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{you've seen the latest cartoon in punch, i take it?}
<C>__{dean wellselly}
<P>__{(completely lost)}
<D>__{i beg your pardon?}
<A>__{disraeli opens the copy of punch and hands it to dean wellselly. the dean clears his throat and starts to read.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<P>__{(as wellselly reads)}
<D>__{one of our madder brethren in the house was calling for disestablishment of the monarchy.}
<A>__{dean wellselly looks up from the article, horrified.}
<C>__{dean wellselly}
<D>__{good lord.}
<C>__{stanley}
<P>__{(playing the soft glove)}
<D>__{i'm sure it won't come to that.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<P>__{(the hard glove)}
<D>__{no. but it has now become a matter for our consciences.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i was just telling stanley how vital it is that the nation should feel the visible influence of the sovereign. as a reminder that parliament, indeed my own ministry, depends on the will of the queen.}
<A>__{dean wellselly nods his head gravely. over his shoulder, stanley is gaping at disraeli's silky distortion of the party political maneuver into a moral imperative.}
<C>__{dean wellselly}
<D>__{i couldn't agree with you more, but i am only dean of windsor. i don't understand what ...}
<A>__{disraeli interrupts.}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{we hear from balmoral that mr brown is interesting her majesty in some of the forms of worship associated with ... low church presbyterian.}
<A>__{silence. dean wellselly's face is a picture of unrestrained horror. low church. presbyterian.}
<C>__{dean wellselly}
<D>__{what can we do?}
<C>__{disraeli}
<D>__{oh, several things.}
