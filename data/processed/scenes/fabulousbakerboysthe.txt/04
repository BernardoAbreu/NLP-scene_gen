<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(taking out a cigarette)}
<D>__{what's the point?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you want me to show up late a few nights?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{frank. i'm here. i always get here. don't sweat it.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{christ, will you look at your hair?}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{jack turns to the wall, which is paneled in tiny tinted mirrors shot through with veins of gold.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what's wrong with it?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you look like you just crawled out of bed.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no one's gonna be looking at my hair. come on, we're on.}
<A>__{frank just stands there, bottled up with exasperation.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{careful, frank. when you get angry your tie starts to spin.}
<A>__{jack steps into the lounge and frank, shaking his head, follows. as they move away, a cardboard stand up is revealed. on it are two 8 x 10 glossies of frank and jack, and below printed in bold letters, this: "tonight! the doubly delightful tones of the fabulous baker boys!"}
<B>__{baker brothers}
<A>__{as they make their way through the dimly lit lounge and settle behind matching pianos, it becomes apparent that what the "fabulous baker boys" are, in fact, is a poor man's version of ferrante and teicher.}
<B>__{wider angle including lounge}
<A>__{as they begin to plink out their "theme song" tables of middle aged couples sipping enormous banana daiquiries begin to tap their feet and bob their heads. after a few bars, the boys finish with a flourish and the couples applaud.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(mr. smile)}
<D>__{thank you. thank you. good evening and welcome to the starfire lounge. my name is frank baker and eighty eight keys across from me is my little brother, jack.}
<A>__{applause. little brother jack smiles, winks, and takes a draw on his cigarette.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing; could do this in his sleep)}
<D>__{you know, my brother and i have been playing together, gosh, i don't know. how long has it been, jack?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{twenty eight years, frank.}
<A>__{applause.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{that's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, jack?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{lotta water.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{of course, back then, things were a little different. i was eight, jack was seven, just about the only song we knew was 'my bonnie lies over the ocean', and the only one who would listen to us was the family cat, cecil.}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<D>__{we must have shaved three lives off that cat, eh, jack?}
<A>__{laughter. jack smiles like he's got a mouth full of razor blades.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{but seriously. it's been fifteen years since jack and i first stepped on the stage as professionals. three states, sixty eight cities, and more grayhairs then we'd like to admit later... well, believe me, we've seen our share of this crazy country of ours. but even though we've played some of the finest venues in the world ...}
<A>__{at this point, jack begins to mimic his brother's words.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{... there's one place that's always been, for us, a very special place, and that place is... this place, the starfire lounge.}
<A>__{jack lays in a few soft bass chords.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{why? well, i guess you could just say it's the ...}
<P>__{(pregnant moment)}
<D>__{... people.}
<A>__{at which point frank's hands descend onto the keyboard and give birth to the melody of what else? "people.' jack and frank later they exit the stage to applause.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{thank you. remember, room service is available}
<A>__{till one a.m. for you late nighters.}
