<L>__{exterior andrea's house day}
<A>__{a packed u haul sits in front of evan's house. andrea shifts the small truck into gear and slowly pulls out. outside the truck, kayleigh waves to evan, tears spilling shamelessly down her cheeks. evan reaches behind his seat and opens a large cardboard box. it is filled with past journals. he finds the most recent journal, uncaps a pen and writes something. finished he presses the journal to the window. evan's diary "i will come back for you." evan waves back to her, trying nonchalantly to wipe away his own tears as she fades into the distance. when kayleigh disappears from sight, andrea looks over to see what he's written.}
<C>__{andrea}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{evan returns the journal and begins writing furiously.}
