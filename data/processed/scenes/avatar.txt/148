<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior willow glade}
<A>__{laughing, they run together into a stand of willows. their trunks are as gnarled as bonsai. long faintly glowing tendrils hang straight down in pastel curtains. underfoot, a bed of moss glows faintly. it reacts to their footsteps with expanding rings of light. it is an exquisitely beautiful spot. the willows stir, responding to their presence. she holds up her hands, letting the tendrils caress her.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{this is a place for prayers to be heard. and sometimes answered.}
<A>__{jake puts out his hands and the tendrils play over his fingers, his palms, his forearms. his eyes go wide. we hear the whispering of ancient na'vi voices.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{it's like a sound you feel.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{we call this utraya mokri the tree of voices. the voices of our ancestors, who live within eywa.}
<A>__{a few woodsprites circle around them, some alighting on their shoulders and arms. they stand, very close together now. her eyes are intense, almost luminous. he feels drawn into them. but she pulls back a little.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{you are omaticaya now. you may make your own bow from the wood of hometree.}
<P>__{(she looks away)}
<D>__{and you may choose a woman.}
<A>__{the amazon warrior trying so hard to sound casual. jake suppresses a smile.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{we have many fine women. ninat is the best singer }
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i don't want ninat.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{there is beyral she is a good hunter }
<A>__{jake puts his fingers on her lips to stop her.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i've already chosen. but this woman must also choose me.}
<A>__{she takes his hands and their fingers intertwine, moving gently over each other.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{she already has.}
<A>__{he puts his face close to hers. she rubs her cheek against his. he kisses her on the mouth. they explore each other. then she pulls back, eyes sparkling.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{kissing is very good. but we have something better.}
<A>__{she pulls him down until they are kneeling, facing each other on the faintly glowing moss. neytiri takes the end of her queue and raises it. jake does the same, with trembling anticipation. the tendrils at the ends move with a life of their own, straining to be joined. macro shot the tendrils intertwine with gentle undulations. jake rocks with the direct contact between his nervous system and hers. the ultimate intimacy. they come together into a kiss and sink down on the bed of moss, and ripples of light spread out around them. the willows sway, without wind, and the night is alive with pulsing energy as we dissolve to : later. she is collapsed across his chest. spent. he strokes her face tenderly.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{neytiri, you know my real body is far away, sleeping.}
<A>__{she raises up, placing her fingertips to his chest }
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{this body is real.}
<P>__{(she touches his forehead)}
<D>__{this spirit is real.}
<A>__{her eyes are luminous, honest, infinitely deep.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{when i was first your teacher, i hated all sky people. but you have also taught me.}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{spirit is all that matters.}
<A>__{she lays her head down, against his chest, listening to his heartbeat.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{i am with you now, jake. we are mated for life.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{we are?}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{yes. it is our way.}
<P>__{(innocently)}
<D>__{oh. i forgot to tell?}
<A>__{he rouses up, making her look at him.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{really, we are?}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{we are.}
<A>__{jake considers this.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{it's cool. i'm there.}
<A>__{he lays his head down, and her arms enfold him, sheltering him as he sleeps.}
