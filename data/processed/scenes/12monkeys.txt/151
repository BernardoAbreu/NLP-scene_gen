<A>__{under the full moon, panthers pace back and forth, back and forth, uttering ominous guttural snarls.}
<L>__{exterior lion's pen zoo}
<A>__{the king of beasts gives a deep, fierce roar. from the darkness, unseen elephants trumpet their response.}

<A>__{a pandemonium of wings rustling, the sharp metallic clinking of metal on metal, the mutter of human voices, then a cacophonous crescendo of frenzied screeching as parrots, cockatoos and other exotic birds careen madly in their cages.}
<L>__{interior movie theater auditorium}
<A>__{close on cole, dozing fitfully, as the sounds of screaming birds continue. suddenly, he comes awake with a start...sees the movie filling his field of vision. his pov: the movie screen. tippi hedrin, overwhelmed by screeching birds in an attic in hitchcock's the birds. angle on cole, orienting himself, looking around. empty seats on both sides of him. he's alone. he panics.}
