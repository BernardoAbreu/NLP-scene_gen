<L>__{interior bojo's night}
<A>__{laz and rae stand like strangers by the door. the place is wall to wall people at the bar, people playing pool. laz sees the culprit of this show. r.l. is gabbing with bojo, a beer in his hand.}

<C>__{rae}
<D>__{by myself?}
<C>__{lazarus}

<A>__{as rae makes her way through the crowd of people, laz marches over to r.l.}

<C>__{r.l.}

<A>__{laz and r.l. look over at rae seated alone at a small table near the stage.}
<C>__{r.l.}
<D>__{heard about this morning.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{we ain't here to talk about that shit.}
<A>__{laz surprises r.l. by walking away and up onto the stage. rae watches as laz, shakes hands with some of the band members. a few whistles from the crowd. laz sits down at a chair off to the right of a short mic stand. he plugs in. rae watches curiously as laz tunes his guitar moans of electric distortion. r.l. sits next to her.}
<C>__{r.l.}
<D>__{you in for it, now. he gonna nail it to the wall tonight. i done pissed him off.}
<A>__{the drummer kicks in. laz tears into the strings. the entire place begins to undulate and bounce as laz returns to the blues.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{i don't know, but i been around, tell me them women shake 'em on down.}
<A>__{cheers. rae watches in awe. she's never seen anything like it. she is surrounded by couples dancing so close they might as well be naked. but there is also a great sense of safety as laz controls the room with his music.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{yes, i'm goin' georgia line. see if them women sweet like mine.}
<A>__{hershel, a black man in his 30's, asks rae to dance.}
<C>__{hershel}
<D>__{you wanna cut it up, baby?}
<C>__{rae}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{well...}
<A>__{rae looks up at laz. laz smiles and nods. rae takes the man's hand and moves out onto the dance floor. r.l. can't be seated anymore. he stands and stomps his foot.}
<C>__{r.l.}
<P>__{(shouting at laz)}
<D>__{yeah, you know you home, old man. you just walked through the door.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{i don't know, but i been told, them georgia women sweet jelly roll.}
<A>__{rae allows laz's voice and guitar to take hold of her. her face gets wet with sweat as she moves, making love to the current in the air. men are dancing all around her, but now she is in control. she turns to a young man and shakes, then an old man. she is free, herself, and above all, safe. laz smiles, unaware of ronnie watching from the window behind him. there is rage and confusion in his face as he watches rae surrounded by dancing limbs.}
