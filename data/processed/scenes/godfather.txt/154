<L>__{ext day: bank building (spring 1946)}
<A>__{day in manhattan. an impressive bank building in the financial center of new york. many limousines are parked, uniforms and plain clothed chauffeurs waiting quietly.}
<L>__{int day: board room (spring 1946)}
<A>__{the board room of a bank, daylight shines in the windows. carlo tramonti, an impressive, handsome middle aged man, sits quietly, smoking a di napoli cigar, our view moves to a man sitting to his left, and a little to the rear, and settles on joseph zaluchi, a moon faced amiable looking man; as the view continues, around the table, we hear:}
<C>__{don corleone }
<D>__{i want to thank you all for coming. i consider it a service done to me personally and i am in the debt of each and every one of you. especially those of you who have traveled from such distances as california, st. louis, kansas city; and new orleans...}
<A>__{the view passes to frank falcone and anthony molinari, both younger than any of the others; then on to domenick panza, short and squat sitting in a wheelchair; then around the table to don vincenenzo forlenza, who is whispering to his jewish assistant; the view passes on to anthony stracci, an older man, sipping from a drink and smoking a cigar; ottilio cuneo, in his middle sixties with a jolly round face; then don phillip tattaglia, a delicate older man with dyed hair and a pencil mustache; and finally, emilio barzini, in his early sixties, a man to 'respect'; whom we had seen at connie's wedding.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{ah well, let's get down to business. we are all honorable men here, we don't have to give assurances as if we were lawyers.}
<P>__{(he sits, gazes out at them, and sighs)}
<D>__{how did things ever go so far? well, no matter. a lot of foolishness has come to pass. it was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.}
<A>__{the view examines the room once again, as the don speaks. a large, clicking board is changing numbers at various times, and two tapes, showing the fluctuations of the market during the day's trading, and projected above. don corleone pauses; and tom hagen hands him a cold drink.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{tattaglia has lost a son; i have lost a son. we are quits. let there be a peace...}
<P>__{(he gestures}
<D>__{expressively, submissively, with}
<P>__{his hands)}
<D>__{that is all i want...}
<C>__{barzini}
<D>__{don corleone is too modest. he had the judges and politicians in his pocket and he refused to share them. his refusal is not the act of a friend. he takes the bread out of the mouths of our families. times have changed, it's not like the old days where everyone can go his own way. if don corleone had all the judges and politicians in new york, then he must share them or let others use them. certainly he can present a bill for such services, we're not communists, after all. but he has to let us draw water from the well. it's that simple.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{my friends, i didn't refuse out of malice. you all know me. when have i ever refused an accommodation? but why, this time? because i think this drug business will destroy us in the years to come. it's not like whiskey or gambling or even women which most people want and is forbidden them by the pezzonovante of the church and the government. but drugs? no. even policemen, who help us in gambling and other things would refuse to help us in drugs. but...i am willing to do whatever all of you think is necessary.}
<C>__{don zaluchi}
<D>__{i don't believe in drugs. for years i paid my people extra so they wouldn't do that kind of business...$200 a week. but it didn't matter. somebody comes to them and says, "i have powders, if you put up three, four thousand dollar investment, we can make fifty thousand distributing." who can resist such a profit? there's no way to control it, as a business...to keep it respectable.}
<P>__{(rapping the table)}
<D>__{i don't want it near schools! i don't want it sold to children. that is an infamita.}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{in my city i would try to keep the traffic in the dark people, the colored. they are the best customers, the least troublesome, and they are animals anyway. they have no respect for their wives or their families or themselves. let them lose their souls with drugs. but something has to be done, we can't have everybody running around doing just what they please, like a bunch of anarchists.}
<C>__{barzini}
<D>__{then, are we agreed; the traffic in drugs will be permitted, but controlled; and don corleone agrees to give it protection in the east.}
<A>__{don corleone nods.}
<C>__{barzini}
<D>__{that's the whole matter then, we have the peace, and let me pay my respects to don corleone, whom we have all known over the years as a man of his word.}
<P>__{(noticing tattaglia is uneasy)}
<D>__{don philip?}
<C>__{tattaglia}
<D>__{i agree to everything here, i'm willing to forget my own misfortune. but i must hear strict assurance from corleone. when time goes by and his position becomes stronger, will he attempt any individual vengeance?}
<A>__{they all look at the don; especially hagen, who feels that don corleone has given a great deal, and must have something else in mind. slowly the don rises.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{i forego my vengeance for my dead son, for the common good. but i have selfish reasons. my youngest son had to flee, accused of sollozzo's murder, and i must now make arrangements so that he can come home with safety, cleared of all those false charges. that is my affair, and i will make those arrangements.}
<P>__{(with strength)}
<D>__{but i am a superstitious man...and so if some unlucky accident should befall my youngest son, if some police officer should accidentally shoot him, or if he should hang himself in his cell, or if my son is struck by a bolt of lightning, then i will blame some of the people here. that, i could never forgive, but...aside from that, let me swear by the souls of my grandchildren that i will never be the one to break the peace we have made.}
