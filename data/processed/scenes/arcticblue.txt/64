<L>__{exterior cache, alaska (moving shot) night}
<A>__{viking bob approaches in his station wagon on a narrow dirt road. the huge night sky all but smothers the weak light from the town up ahead. cache seems a mistake a jumble of unpainted buildings in the middle of a big nothing, twenty miles north of the arctic circle. still, it's more animated than devil's cauldron. there are a hundred permanent residents, several taverns and a three store, fly in shopping center. even though it's the middle of the night, people roam the streets, drinking and socializing. with only a couple feet of snow on the ground, this is still summertime. under storefront awnings, drunken indians sleep on the concrete. viking bob cruises the main drag, looking for the other trappers. he spots their jeep in front of a dangerous looking saloon called the "bear sign inn."}
