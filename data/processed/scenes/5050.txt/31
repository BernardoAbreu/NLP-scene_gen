<A>__{everyone sits around the table. edith pokes at her plate of vegetarian goulash, confused as to what she's looking at.}

<C>__{edith}
<D>__{but it's not meat.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{no, but it has a texture just like meat.}
<A>__{edith reluctantly takes a small bite of the goulash.}
<C>__{edith}
<P>__{(insincere)}
<D>__{mmmmm. it's good.}
<A>__{edith puts her spoon down. she pulls a handful of pills out her fanny pack and puts them in front of art.}

<D>__{art, take your pills.}
<A>__{art picks up the pills and puts them in his mouth, but doesn't swallow.}

<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{mom, i have a giant tumor in my spine.}
<A>__{edith sits motionless for what seems an eternity. the only indication that she's not dead is the movement of her index finger, which twitches uncontrollably. adam sits uneasy, tying to anticipate his mother's next move.}
<C>__{adam }
<D>__{mom?}
<A>__{edith calmly rises from of her seat and heads to the kitchen. adam follows after her.}
<C>__{adam }
<D>__{mom, what are you doing?}

<C>__{edith}
<D>__{i saw on the today show that it reduces your risk of getting cancer by fifteen percent.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{mom, i already have cancer.}
<A>__{refusing to look at her son, edith frantically rifles through her fanny pack.}
<C>__{edith}
<D>__{here take these.}
<A>__{her hands now shaking uncontrollably, edith hands adam a large number of prescription pills.}
<C>__{edith }
<D>__{aspirin, zoloft, lexapro, lipitor, flagel, ditropan, alka seltzer.}
<C>__{adam}

<C>__{adam}
<D>__{mom.}
<A>__{edith's a nervous wreck, frantic and hysterical.}
<C>__{edith}
<D>__{how could this happen?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{it's genetic.}
<C>__{edith}
<D>__{genetic? it must be from your father's side of the family, they're always getting sick. your uncle bobby just got crohns.}
<A>__{adam's father looks up from his plate of goulash...}
<C>__{art}
<D>__{that's a disorder of the bowels, son. how are your bowels?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{the problem is not with my bowels.}

<D>__{i think i have a right to take care of my son with cancer.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{it's nothing. really.}
<C>__{edith}
<D>__{nothing! you tell me you have cancer of the spine and now you tell me it's nothing.}
<A>__{adam looks to rachel for support.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{edith, i can't even imagine how hard this must be for you. but i promise, there's nothing for you to worry about. i'm going to be here every step of the way, to help take good care of your son.}
