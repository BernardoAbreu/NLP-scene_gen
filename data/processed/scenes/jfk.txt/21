<T>__{timecut to :}
<A>__{the prison work area, where willie talks, leaning against a tree looking out on a mangrove swamp. it's lunch break and other prisoners move in the background, eating, socializing.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i want to thank you, mr. o'keefe, for this time.}
<C>__{o'keefe}
<D>__{call me willie. i ain't got nuthin' but time, mr. garrison. minutes, hours, days, years of'em. time just stands still here like a snake sunnin' itself in the road...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{clay bertrand, willie?}
<C>__{o'keefe}
<D>__{yeah. clay. i met him sometime in june of '62 at the masquerade bar. dave ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{for sexual purposes?}
<C>__{o'keefe}
<D>__{well... yeah.}
<A>__{flashback to the masquerade bar in the french quarter. it's nighttime and ferrie, bertrand and o'keefe sit at a back booth. bertrand, as seen earlier, is an imposing, white haired patrician man, over six feet tall, heavily defined bones and eyelids, in his late 40's or early 50's.}
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{did he pay you for this?}
<C>__{o'keefe }
<D>__{twenty dollars each time. hell, it's no secret. that's what i'm here for.}
<A>__{they rise to leave. bertrand with a slight limp.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{anything else unusual about him you'd be able to describe in a court of law, willie?}
<C>__{o'keefe }
<D>__{i remember he had some kinda thing wrong with his left leg. he limped. don't get me wrong, he's not one of those, you know, limp wrists. he's a butch john. you'd meet him on the street, you'd never snap. you could go fishing with him, play poker with him, you'd never snap in a million years. so one night we were over at ferrie's place. having a party. sometime in the late summer of '63.}
<A>__{flashback to dave ferrie's apartment on a night in 1963. the place is filled messy bricabrac, including two dozen mouse cages for ferrie's cancer experiments. ferrie, bertrand, o'keefe, and four cubans in battle fatigues are laughing and fooling around. oswald is in a corner cleaning a .22 rifle with a scope on it. he looks different, unkempt, unshaven. a record player grinds out a speech in spanish by castro. some other people are there as well it's a beatnik scene: sandals, hanging out, only one woman. ferrie is taking pictures throughout of the group horsing around, photographing oswald.}
<C>__{o'keefe}
<D>__{...there were about nine or ten people, cubans, friends of dave doing some stuff in the bush with him. place was a mess. dave's mind was a mess,}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{y'know he had all those mice cages around cause he's working on this cure for cancer... dave's smart real smart speaks five languages, knows philosophy, medicine, military history, politics. he wanted to be a priest but they defrocked him 'cause he was queer...}
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{and that's where you met oswald for the first time?}
<C>__{o'keefe }
<D>__{yeah, strange guy. dave introduced him as...}
<C>__{ferrie}
<D>__{willie, say hello to leon oswald.}
<C>__{o'keefe}
<P>__{(over the racket)}
<D>__{how ya doing?}
<C>__{oswald}
<P>__{(sullen, to ferrie)}
<D>__{what the fuck's he doing here?}
<C>__{o'keefe}
<D>__{fuck you, man.}
<A>__{ferrie separates them. oswald seems to resent an outsider being there.}
<C>__{ferrie}
<P>__{(to o'keefe)}
<D>__{leon's in a bad mood, don't get excited, he's all right.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{would you say this "leon" was actually lee harvey oswald?}
<C>__{o'keefe}
<P>__{(in present)}
<D>__{fuck, yes. hell, i'm already in jail. i got no reason to lie to you. i ain't no nigger.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{go on, willie.}
<C>__{o'keefe}
<P>__{(present merging to past)}
<D>__{...well the party got crazier and crazier, one of those, y'know "beatnik" type things.}
<C>__{ferrie}
<P>__{(to o'keefe)}
<D>__{we're having a little meeting here.}
<P>__{(indicates the second player)}
<D>__{that's castro. sounds like hitler doesn't he? sonofabitch is going to go. real soon.}
<C>__{cubans}
<D>__{muerte a fidel! muerte!}
<C>__{bertrand}
<P>__{(irritated at the noise)}
<D>__{oh, stop it already! what are all these people doing here anyway? i can't bear all this infernal noise.}
<C>__{ferrie}
<D>__{clara, don't be so sensitive.}
<C>__{bertrand}
<D>__{i didn't come here for a pep rally. get all this riffraff out of here.}
<C>__{ferrie}
<D>__{okay, okay.}
