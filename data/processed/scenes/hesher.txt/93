<L>__{interior forney house grandma's bedroom doorway night}
<A>__{grandma lies in bed on top of her covers. hesher enters the doorway and knocks lightly.}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{did you figure it out yet?}
<C>__{grandma}
<D>__{figure what out, dear?}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{what's green and slimy and smells like bacon?}
<C>__{grandma}
<D>__{no, not yet dear. can you do me a favor?}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{sure, what?}
<C>__{grandma}
<D>__{will you please hand me that red tin on the cabinet dear?}
<A>__{hesher enters the room, grabs the tin from on top of the cabinet and hands it to grandma on the bed.}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{kermit the frog's finger.}
<C>__{grandma}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{think about it... miss piggy.}
<A>__{grandma opens her red tin and takes out what looks like a rolled cigarette.}
<C>__{hesher }
<D>__{woah, what's that?}
<C>__{grandma}
<D>__{oh, i'm feeling very nauseated. they're medical cigarettes that help me with the nausea. will you light a match for me, dear?}
<C>__{hesher}
<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{hang on a second. can i see that?}
<A>__{hesher sniffs the "cigarette".}
<C>__{hesher }
<D>__{no shit.}
<A>__{hesher sets the "cigarette" down.}
<C>__{hesher }
<D>__{i will be right back.}
<A>__{hesher dashes out of grandma's room. after a few moments, he comes back and sits on the edge of the bed. he is holding a glass bong. the bong has so much resin caked onto the sides, it looks as though a thousand pounds of marijuana have been smoked through it.}
<C>__{hesher }
<D>__{may i?}
<A>__{hesher takes one of grandma's medical joints and breaks it in half and loads the bowl of the pipe.}
<C>__{grandma}
<D>__{what is that?}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{it's a bong. the water filters the smoke. it's probably the most healthy way to smoke weed.}
<A>__{hesher lights up and takes a huge hit from the bong. he explains his technique to grandma while holding the smoke in.}
<C>__{hesher }
<D>__{ok, so basically cover the hole here with your thumb then suck on the top and once the chamber fills with smoke, take your finger off the hole and suck in.}
<A>__{hesher takes a quick sip of air sucking the smoke deeper into his lungs.}
<C>__{hesher }
<D>__{then try and hold the smoke in for as long as possible, ok bro?}
<C>__{grandma}
<D>__{umm, ok.}
<A>__{grandma takes the bong and has a hit. it's a bit clunky, but she manages to make it work.}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{ok, lift your finger.}
<A>__{hesher helps her. the smoke shoots into her lungs. grandma begins to cough.}
<C>__{grandma}
<D>__{oh, wow... that was a big one.}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{yeah, that was good. hit it again.}
<A>__{grandma has another hit. it goes well. she blows out the smoke. hesher takes the bong off her and has another huge one for himself. he passes the bong back.}
<C>__{grandma}
<D>__{i think i'm ok, dear.}
<A>__{hesher takes the last hit. he dusts off the bowl and sets the water pipe down. they sit for a moment and let the drug sink in.}
<C>__{grandma }
<D>__{honey, how old are you?}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{who wants to know?}
<C>__{grandma}
<D>__{i don't know. you seem a little older than tj.}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{grandma}
<D>__{oh, stop it. aren't you a little old to be hanging around tj all the time?}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{aren't you?}
<C>__{grandma}
<D>__{no, i'm his grandmother.}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{yeah, i guess you have a pointerior.. ok, well i used to have a mouse. no, wait... hang on a minute. i used to have a snake. and do you know what snakes eat?}
<C>__{grandma}
<D>__{actually, there's no limit to the food items that you can even think of that a snake might eat. whatever is available in abundance would become the prey for the snakes. depending on their growth, their diet }
<A>__{hesher cuts her off.}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{yeah, ok, ok well, actually they eat mice.}
<C>__{grandma}
<D>__{they do eat mice. a lot of times snakes eat other snakes because they're the right shape }
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{yeah, ok, well anyway... i used to have a snake and i fed it mice. but one time i fed this little fuckin' mouse to my snake and that mouse was tough. i dropped that mouse in the snake's tank and the snake wouldn't go near him, and any time he tried that mouse would just smack him with his little, you know...}
<A>__{hesher looks at his hand, not knowing what mouse hands are called.}
<C>__{hesher }
<D>__{with his little mouse hand. so instead of eating the mouse the snake just curled up crying in the corner and the mouse ruled that fuckin' cage. and this went on for weeks, the snake wouldn't go near him. that tiny mouse used to sit in a little miniature lawn chair scratching his balls and shelling peanuts and this snake was just too scared to go near it. and cuz the snake was scared of that mouse i had to feed him other mice, but every time i dropped another mouse in the tank, it'd hide behind the brave mouse. and so eventually the snake starved to death. i had a cage full of mice.}
<A>__{grandma is stoned and sleepy and fading out.}
<C>__{grandma}
<D>__{so is tj the mouse?}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{maybe he is.}
<C>__{grandma}
<D>__{well then, what am i?}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{you're an old lady.}
<C>__{grandma}
<D>__{no, i'm a grandmother.}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{yes you are. and you know what grandmother? i'm gonna go on a walk with you in the morning.}
<C>__{grandma}
<D>__{oh, that's nice. where are you going?}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{i'm not going anywhere. i'm going with you. around the block, i guess.}
<C>__{grandma}
<D>__{oh, ok, well have a nice time. i will see you when you get back.}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{no, i'm going with you.}
<C>__{grandma}
<D>__{ohh, ok, caauuse iii...}
<A>__{grandma has fallen asleep, but mumbles like she is continuing the conversation. hesher smiles to himself, turns off her lamp and exits the room.}
