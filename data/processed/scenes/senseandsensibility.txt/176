<A>__{thomas is sitting on the back of a local wagon, holding a basket of food. he jumps off near the cottage and waves a cheery farewell to the driver.}
<L>__{interior barton cottage parlour day}
<A>__{close on the accounts book, covered in blots and crossed out sums. pull up to reveal marianne labouring over it. her sickness has left her slightly short sighted and she uses a pince nez that makes her look like an owl. elinor is sewing and mrs dashwood is snoozing. margaret goes up and looks over marianne's shoulder. she frowns at the spider's web of ink.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{you'll go blind if you're not careful.}
<A>__{betsy brings in coals for the fire. mrs dashwood rouses herself.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{is thomas back from exeter, betsy?}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{yes, ma'am he brung back two lovely fillets for you.}
<A>__{mrs dashwood looks nervously at elinor like a child who has been caught out.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{beef is far less expensive in exeter, and anyway they are for marianne.}
<A>__{elinor laughs and rolls her eyes to heaven. betsy turns on her way out to remark:}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{sixpence a piece, miss dashwood. oh, and he says mr ferrars is married, but i suppose you know that, ma'am.}
<A>__{there is a stunned silence. everyone looks at elinor.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{fetch thomas to us, betsy.}
<A>__{betsy leaves. they all sit very still. margaret is about to talk to elinor about it but marianne stops her. thomas enters.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{beg pardon, miss dashwood, but they was the cheapest in the market }
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{it was a very good price, thomas, well done. would you be so kind as to build up the fire a little?}
<C>__{thomas}
<P>__{(relieved)}
<D>__{yes, ma'am.}
<A>__{there is a pause.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{who told you that mr ferrars was married, thomas?}
<A>__{thomas builds up the fire as he answers. he tells the story with pleasure.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{i seen him myself, ma'am, and his lady too, miss lucy steele as was they were stopping in a chaise at the new london inn. i happened to look up as i passed the chaise and i see it was miss steele. so i took off my hat and she inquired after you, ma'am, and all the young ladies, especially miss dashwood, and bid me i should give you her and mr ferrars's best compliments and service and how they'd be sure to send you a piece of the cake.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{was mr ferrars in the carriage with her?}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{yes, ma'am i just seen him leaning back in it, but he did not look up.}
<A>__{elinor screws up her courage.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{did }
<A>__{but she cannot continue. marianne glances at her compassionately and takes over.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{did mrs ferrars seem well?}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{yes, miss marianne she said how she was vastly contented and, since she was always a very affable young lady, i made free to wish her joy.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{thank you, thomas.}
<A>__{he nods and leaves, confused by the silent atmosphere. elinor sits for a moment, then gets up and walks out.}
