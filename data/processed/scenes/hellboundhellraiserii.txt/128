<L>__{interior the centre of hell}
<A>__{leviathan spins and fires light in the centre, his machine like breathing drowning all other sound. we are looking down the catwalk as kirsty and tiffany approach its edge. the beams of black light wash across their faces, as they passed over malahide's in the earlier scene. images of horror freeze momentarily before them and then pass on, only to be replaced by others.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{i'm scared.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{no. don't let it. you've come this far.}
<A>__{the girls press on. whether leviathan is oblivious to their presence or simply doesn't consider them a threat, the beams stop striking the girls' faces. nevertheless, the mood remains ominous. the audience should feel something is about to happen. they are six feet from the lip of the catwalk. tiffany kneels and, holding the white diamond box in front of her, begins to move her fingers over it. the music box tune begins to play as the box begins to move. that 'something' that the audience was waiting to happen, suddenly does; malahide flies up from the abyss beside the catwalk. the vastness of the limb that seals him to leviathan is now directly apparent; instead of merging into black light, the limb itself trails through the air over the huge distance to leviathan itself. one of the limbs from malahide's palms flies out and knocks the box from tiffany's hands. it rolls perilously close to the edge of the catwalk. kirsty grabs tiffany and, dragging her to her feet, pulls her further back down the catwalk as malahide floats to a landing between them and the box.}
<C>__{malahide}
<D>__{ah, girls. and how are we feeling today?}
<A>__{the blades on the end of his limbs twitch eagerly.}
<C>__{malahide}
<D>__{you have your whole lives behind you now.}
<A>__{the limbs fly forward. kirsty screams and both girls run up the catwalk. about halfway back up, however, tiffany stops, turns around, and begins to walk back. kirsty calls out.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{tiffany! no!}
<A>__{the camera stays with tiffany as she makes her way back. kirsty's voice stays on the soundtrack for a time, imploring her friend to turn back and then simply stops. this should be abrupt enough to make the audience notice but smooth enough to avoid their attention leaving tiffany. malahide waits, happy to see a patient so keen on the knife. very slowly, tiffany moves forward, inch by slow inch. this is something she has to do; the expression on her face is not determination but terror. and malahide is very happy to encourage this.}
<C>__{malahide}
<D>__{surgery is open, tiffany. what was today's agenda?}
<A>__{his scalpels flick in the air, making small slicing motions.}
<C>__{malahide}
<D>__{ah, yes. evisceration.}
<A>__{still tiffany comes forward, closer and closer until she is surely close enough to be grabbed. suddenly, she is grabbed. but from behind, and by a human hand. tiffany gasps, and turns to see who has seized her. she screams. it is julia. the limbs retract into malahide's palms. he smiles.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{doctor. i've missed you.}
<A>__{julia, having presumably just replaced her skin, is not quite as perfect as before; there are bloody lines like scars beneath her ears and chin as if the skin required some adjustment before being put on. julia moves forward, her left arm still holding tiffany, her smile returning malahide's.}
<C>__{malahide}
<D>__{i knew you'd come back.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{i'm a girl who keeps her promises.}
<A>__{julia is right next to malahide now. smoothly, she releases her grip on tiffany and embraces malahide sensuously. he returns the embrace. they kiss. unseen, tiffany moves to the edge of the catwalk and picks up the box. her fingers move over it, finding its solution. suddenly, leviathan's breath becomes a roar of anger and fear. malahide breaks away from his kiss, his face a mixture of confusion and rage. julia plants both hands in the middle of his chest and pushes. he falls over the lip of the catwalk but, almost before he drops from sight, he is suddenly pulled backwards through the air, screaming, as leviathan's limb retracts. julia jumps back. shouting.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{do it, tiffany! do it!}
<A>__{tiffany's fingers fly over the box and suddenly we see what is happening. the mountain like leviathan is following the movements of the small replica in tiffany's hands. as tiffany inverts the new configuration back towards a closed box, leviathan too is being twisted and turned. being closed. the whole centre of hell shakes as if suffering a mild earthquake. julia and tiffany almost lose their footing, but tiffany continues working. she is nearly, there. leviathan is halfway between its white diamond, majesty and a huge closed box. tiffany takes her hands from the box. it is done. the larger box operates a few seconds behind it's control, so that we can inter cut the final sliding and creaking into position with the following human drama; as leviathan makes its final closing, the mild tremors of before become larger. hell shakes violently and this time tiffany does lose her footing. she looks set to tumble into the vast abyss to the side of the catwalk but just manages to catch hold of the edge with one hand. the small box flies from her hand and hurtles down into the miles of blackness below. tiffany dangles over the edge, her feet kicking wildly for a foothold that doesn't exist. suddenly, a hand extends to her. she looks up. it is julia. for a second, nothing happens.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{trust me.}
<A>__{tiffany lifts one hand off the edge and grabs at julia's proffered wrist. julia begins to pull up and for a moment it seems the crisis is over. then a terrible and familiar ripping noise is heard: the skin of the arm that tiffany clings to begins to rip free at the shoulder. gradually, like a shirt's threads unraveling, it comes off. tiffany's weight pulls it clear like a very long and very tasteless evening glove and it seems she will finally make the long drop. at the final second, as the arm skin comes off, the entire skin flies from the body and falls with its arm into the abyss. tiffany screams. she is going to die. but suddenly the two arms that have just lost their skin fly out again and catch her fingers. tiffany is hauled over the edge and staggers to her feet, staring into the bloodied face of kirsty, who had donned julia's skin to help her friend. the two girls share a quick and joyous embrace and then run rapidly up the catwalk. the camera stays with leviathan. the rumbling stops. and the mountainous box creaks into its final, sealed position.}
