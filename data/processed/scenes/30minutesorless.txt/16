<L>__{interior living room, nice house day}
<A>__{the shades are drawn. we hear a girl scream bloody murder! the guys are watching friday the 13th part 3...in 3d. they both wear cheap cardboard glasses. jay jumps back as jason wields a 3d ax.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{shit, man! it's so real!}
<A>__{dwayne reaches out, "touching" the 3d images. he stands and starts humping the air.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{check it out. i ain't afraid of jason. i'm fucking him.}
<P>__{(thrusting harder)}
<D>__{you like that, jason!? in the mask!}
<A>__{jay cracks up. the lights flick on.}
<C>__{grizzled voice }
<D>__{who are you two fags fucking?}
<A>__{standing by the switch is dwayne's dad, jerry (70s). most people just call him "the major." the faded usmc tattoo on his thick forearm explains why.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{afternoon, major.}
<A>__{dwayne flops back onto the couch.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{dad, we're watching a flick. we got 45 minutes and a potential 3d sex scene left. you're sorta coming in at the worst possible moment.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{i bought that tv set so i could watch my programs, not so you and your friend could louse up my couch.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{you gotta learn how to share the common space.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{the only thing common in this house is you. you remind me of your damn mother. fat, dumb, and in my way.}
<A>__{the major grabs dwayne and pulls him up off the couch. he gets right in his face...scary, intense. dwayne turns to jay.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{let's get outta here. this movie sucks anyway.}
<A>__{jay gets up and files out the door. dwayne goes to take the cold cut plate. the major grabs his arm.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{i paid for the damn cold cuts, too. maybe if you had a job, or a fucking prospect, or a clue how to find any of the above, i'd let you eat 'em.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{you know, you can be a real sonofabitch, dad.}
<C>__{major}
<D>__{that's what it takes, boy. in the corps, men like you wore dresses to keep us entertained.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{that's pretty fucking disturbing!}
<A>__{dwayne storms off.}
