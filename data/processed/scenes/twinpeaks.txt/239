<A>__{laura and james on the bike make their way down to sparkwood and twenty one. laura leans way back on the bike. laura's pov looking up at the trees as they fly by in a dark blur.}

<C>__{laura}
<D>__{the trees... the trees...}
<A>__{laura screams with agony and tries to get off as they approach the light. laura falls off as they skid to a stop.}
<C>__{james}
<P>__{(confused and terrified)}
<D>__{laura...}
<A>__{laura crawls back up and puts her hands around james' neck.}
<C>__{laura}
<P>__{(from far away she screams)}
<D>__{james, i love you.}
<A>__{for a moment she focuses on him. she looks like the laura that james loves. innocent and beautiful. laura turns and sees the woods. it pulls her. she releases her hold on james and runs into the waiting darkness. the red light swings in the wind above james. it turns green, but he doesn't move. when the light turns red again, james guns the engine and lifts the bike up on its back tire. james screams then roars down the road away from us. off to the side of the road lies doc hayward's wilted red rose.}
