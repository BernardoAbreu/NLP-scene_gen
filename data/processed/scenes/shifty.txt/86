<A>__{shifty enters. the camera follows. we're introduced to a dark hallway, clothes, magazines and cd's litter the floor. shifty peers into one of the bedrooms leading off from the hallway a mattress with no sheets. shifty carries on down the hallway. reaching a door, he slowly pushes it open, to reveal a grotty front room. on the tv a violent movie scene plays out, the sound turned down. a wiry looking 18 year old, otis, sits on the sofa rolling a spliff, absorbed by the films images. a chavvy looking bird sits to his left. shifty, cool as a cucumber, rolls into the front room, straight up to the stereo, and turns it off. the young kid sits there, just staring, a spliff held in his two hands, totally flummoxed. shifty stares him out.}
