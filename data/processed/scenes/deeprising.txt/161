<D>__{hey you! muscles! out here!}

<A>__{machine shop moments later damp, dark and disgusting. a maze of pipes and gears lines the walls. finnegan slams the hatch shut. dogs it tight. everyone's gathering themselves around the room: trillian, pantucci, hanover, mamooli, chin, the captain and canton.}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{we've gotta call for help.}
<C>__{pantucci}
<D>__{yeah man, no shit, call in the marines.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{we can't...all the communication systems went down.}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{so get them back up.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{i don't know how.}
<C>__{pantucci}
<D>__{hey i can fix any damn thing... where's the comm. center?}
<C>__{canton}
<D>__{we should get off as soon as possible.}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{but if we can at least send a message...}
<C>__{canton}
<D>__{i say we evacuate as soon as...}
<C>__{finnegan}
<P>__{(to canton)}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{he's the owner...}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{why don't you want a message sent?}
<C>__{canton}
<D>__{i just think that...}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{because you know a message can't be sent...}
<A>__{there is a moment of silence.}
<C>__{finnegan }
<D>__{you're the inside guy aren't you? the guy who knocked out the communications.}
<A>__{hanover sets mason's pulse rifle down and claps his hands.}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{bravo.}
<A>__{canton flashes hanover a look. the captain is confused. trillian suddenly grabs canton, spins him around and slams him against the hull.}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{how the hell do we fix it?!}
<A>__{a tense moment as canton debates his situation, then relents.}
<C>__{canton}
<D>__{you can't... all the systems were melted at their core by nitric acid...}
<C>__{captain}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{this was your life's work...your dreams...}
<C>__{canton}
<D>__{my dreams cost more than they would make...i miscalculated the market... there was no way i could recoup...}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{unless you collected on the insurance...}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{what are you people talking about?}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{he's with them.}
<A>__{he motions to the mercenaries.}
<C>__{finnegan }
<D>__{they rob the joint blind and torpedo it to the bottom. he collects the insurance, and sails off into the sunset clean as a whistle.}
<A>__{finnegan fixes hanover with a look of certainty.}
<C>__{finnegan }
<D>__{right?}
<A>__{the captain blows. he leaps on canton. his hands find the older man's throat.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{all these people dead!! because you screwed up on the math??}
<A>__{finnegan pulls the captain off.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{it's not going to help us!}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{we're going to die here! we're going to die!}
<A>__{finnegan holds the captain with both hands, calming him.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{i was born in a city housing project in the bronx ok? it's not in the cards that i die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up?}
<C>__{trillian}
<P>__{(alarmed)}
<D>__{you hear that?}
<A>__{unseen by anyone, there is movement within the machinery. the walls start to come alive with dark, shadowy impressions. hidden within the maze of machinery, obscured by the bad lighting, glistening abominations slither over pipes, squirm through gears, and undulate in and out of crevices and holes. the room is becoming a living, throbbing, pulsating horror.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{they are...they are everywhere.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{all right, be cool, everybody, nice and slow, no sudden moves.}
<A>__{everybody slowly and quietly moves for the far hatch. then a loud gurgling is heard. everybody looks up at the ceiling. hidden within the girders, and sticking to them, a large translucent intestine like thing crosses the ceiling. inside it are strange, disgusting biological workings. the gurgling suddenly gets dramatically louder. and then we see billy and leila, being sucked down the entire length of the fatty intestine. still alive. and squirming wildly. everybody freaks out and hauls ass for the hatch. finnegan and hanover open fire. covering their asses.}
