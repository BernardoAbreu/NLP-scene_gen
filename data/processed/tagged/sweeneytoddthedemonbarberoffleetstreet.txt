<L>__{interior dark chamber night}
<A>__{foreboding organ music is heard... we are looking down at a rough brick floor ... is it an alley? ... a cobblestone street? ... a warehouse? a factory? ... we're not sure... the flickering glow of flame is the only illumination... the ominous organ music continues as... from the bottom of the frame... a dark pool of blood slowly begins to spread ... moving up the frame, defying gravity ... the flickering flame reflected in the blood... finally, the pool of blood fills the entire frame. suddenly a shrill factory whistle blows enormously loud blood chilling and spine shattering the whistle is a bizarre combination of sound: a factory whistle; a hog being slaughtered; a dog snarling; a roaring inferno; a human scream and a man's face appears, upside down, reflected in the pool of blood. he is the gentleman, a slender dandy in pearl grey gloves and matching waistcoat. a cold and superior aristocrat. the camera slowly revolves the gentleman becoming right side up as }
<C>__{gentleman}
<D>__{attend the tale of sweeney todd. his skin was pale and his eye was odd. he shaved the faces of gentlemen who never thereafter were heard of again. he trod a path that few have trod, did sweeney todd, the demon barber of fleet street.}
<A>__{we cut from the blood to see the gentleman standing before us. strangely impassive. we are in an eerie dark chamber, unclear, a low ceiling, a world of silhouettes and shadows. another figure emerges from the miasma of shadows, into the hellish flickering of flame: the banker. he is large, rotund and sleek. impressive muttonchops.}
<C>__{banker}
<D>__{he kept a shop in london town, of fancy clients and good renown, and what if none of their souls were saved? they went to their maker impeccably shaved...}
<A>__{more figures begin to emerge from the shadows, joining the gentleman and the banker as...}

<A>__{anthony, a young sailor of about 20, is standing at the rail of a ship. we see the obscure shape of rigging and sails behind him. the cries of sailors echo. behind him stand the gentleman and the banker. they are looking past anthony, looking at something. they move away as anthony peers through the fog, straining to see... london. gradually, as the ship approaches, the towering spires and mountainous rooftops of the city begin to stand out in relief, to emerge through the fog like a tiger creeping toward its prey. music continues as anthony takes in the dreadful and magnificent spectacle of the 19th century metropolis. the gnarl of rooftops. the labyrinth of streets and alleys. the black trails of smoke reaching up like skeletal fingers from a thousand chimneys. london. sulfurous london. anthony is awestruck.}

<A>__{todd shudders violently, almost snarling.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{there's a hole in the world like a great black pit and the vermin of the world inhabit it and its morals aren't worth what a pig could spit and it goes by the name of london. at the top of the hole sit the privileged few making mock of the vermin in the lower zoo, turning beauty into filth and greed. i too have sailed the world, and seen its wonders for the cruelty of men is as wondrous as peru, but there's no place like london!}

<D>__{there was another man who saw that she was beautiful, a pious vulture of the law, who with a gesture of his claw removed the barber from his plate. then there was nothing but to wait and she would fall, so soft, so young, so lost, and oh, so beautiful!}

<D>__{ah sir, times is hard. times is hard.}
<A>__{she finishes one of the crusts with a flourish as the music ends. todd, meanwhile, is gulping at his ale, trying to wash down mrs. lovett's hideous creation.}

<D>__{green finch and linnet bird, nightingale, blackbird, how is it you sing? how can you jubilate, sitting in cages, never taking wing? outside the sky waits, beckoning, beckoning, just beyond the bars. how can you remain, staring at the rain, maddened by the stars? how is it you sing anything? how is it you sing?}

<D>__{that's johanna, his pretty little ward. keeps her snug, he does, all locked up ... so don't you go trespassing there or it's a good whipping for you or any other young man with mischief on his mind...}
<A>__{she suddenly leers into a lewd and demented assault:}
<C>__{beggar woman}
<D>__{'ow would you like a little muff, dear, a little jig jig a little bounce around the bush? wouldn't you like to push me parsley? it looks to me, dear, like you got plenty there to push.}

<C>__{beggar woman}
<D>__{alms! ... alms!... for a desperate woman...}
<A>__{anthony considers the mansion. he sees a figure standing at a window, unclear behind the shutters, watching him. he sits on a bench outside the mansion and sings quietly:}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{i feel you, johanna, i feel you. i was half convinced i'd waken, satisfied enough to dream you. happily i was mistaken, johanna! i will steal you, johanna, i will steal you...}
<A>__{then the figure disappears from the window above. anthony stands, waits. then the doors to the mansion swing open... anthony is expecting johanna... but it is judge turpin, the predator we met in todd's flashback, who steps into the doorway. he seems a different man now. paternal and warm, he smiles and beckons to anthony. anthony hesitates, unsure. the judge beckons again. again the warm smile.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{come in, lad. come in...}

<D>__{yes, it's terribly large on the map but i keep getting lost...}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{sit down, lad, sit down.}
<A>__{anthony sits, uncomfortable, as the judge pours two snifters of brandy.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{it's embarrassing for a sailor to lose his bearings, but, well, there you are.}
<A>__{then... the large form of the beadle appears from the shadows. no introduction is made. anthony glances to him, uneasy.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{a sailor, eh?}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{yes, sir. the "bountiful" out of plymouth.}

<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{sir?}
<A>__{the judge moves to consider some beautiful volumes, bound in the richest leather. he runs a finger along the spines of the books; his large library of pornography.}

<A>__{he presses the end of his billyclub into anthony's forehead, grinding it hard }
<C>__{beadle}
<D>__{next time it'll be your pretty brains all over the pavement.}
<A>__{with that, the beadle returns to the mansion and slams the door. anthony slowly pulls himself to his knees, doubled over, coughing up blood. a long beat as anthony gets his breath, wiping blood from his face. still doubled over, he sings with burning intensity:}

<D>__{i will steal you, johanna, i will steal you! do they think that walls can hide you? even now i'm at your window. i am in the dark beside you, buried sweetly in your yellow hair.}

<A>__{the music swells as anthony emerges from the dark alley into the bright sunlight. he makes his way along the sidewalk:}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{i feel you, johanna, and one day i will steal you. till i'm with you then, i'm with you there, sweetly buried in your yellow hair...}

<D>__{oh mr. t., do you really think you can do it?}
<C>__{todd}

<D>__{and furthermore "signor" i have serviced no kings, yet i wager i can shave a cheek with ten times more dexterity that any street mountebank.}
<A>__{he snaps open his razor case and holds it up for the crowd to see, turning to display the wondrous razors:}

<A>__{music begins as todd moves into action, preparing the challenge:}

<D>__{... let the challenge commence!}
<A>__{one man sits in todd's plain chair as the other moves to an elaborate chair on pirelli's caravan. pirelli shakes out a fancy bib with a flourish and covers his man. toby prepares pirelli's ornate shaving supplies as todd takes a plain towel and tucks it around his man's neck.}

<D>__{oh, i beg a you pardon 'll call me a lie, was a only a cardinal nope! it was a da pope!}
<A>__{unexpectedly, todd still shows no signs of starting to shave his man. he merely watches pirelli's performance. mrs. lovett looks at him nervously, wishing he would get on with it. pirelli, now feeling he can take his time, sings lyrically as he lathers and shaves with rhythmic scrapes and elaborate gestures of wiping the razor.}
<C>__{pirelli}
<D>__{to shave a da face, to cut a da hair, require da grace require da flair, for if a you slip, you nick da skin, you clip a da chin, you rip a da lip a bit beyond a repair!}
