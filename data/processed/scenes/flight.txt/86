<D>__{many hours have passed since the footage you just watched but the crash site remains active as investigators work through the night. using flood lights and miners' caps, teams continue to comb the crash field looking for the answers to the hard questions as to what brought down southjet's flight 227. those answers remain in darkness as do the broken pieces of the aircraft. hopefully sunlight will bring answers. for now this is kent johnson reporting.}
