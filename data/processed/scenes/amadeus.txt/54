<D>__{madame cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.}
<C>__{salieri}

<A>__{he gets up and enters:}
<L>__{interior music room in salieri's apartment day 1780's}
<A>__{katherina cavalieri, a young, high spirited soprano of twenty is waiting for him, dressed in a fashionable dress and wearing on her head an exotic turban of satin, with a feather. lorl exits.}
<C>__{cavalieri}
<P>__{(curtseying to him)}
<D>__{maestro.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{good morning.}
<C>__{cavalieri}
<P>__{(posing, in her turban)}
<D>__{well? how do you like it? it's turkish. my hairdresser tells me everything's going to be turkish this year!}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{really? what else did he tell you today? give me some gossip.}
<C>__{cavalieri}
<D>__{well, i heard you met herr mozart.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{oh? news travels fast in vienna.}
<C>__{cavalieri}
<D>__{and he's been commissioned to write an opera. is it true?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{cavalieri}
<D>__{is there a part for me?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{cavalieri}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{well even if there is, i don't think you want to get involved with this one.}
<C>__{cavalieri}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{well, do you know where it's set, my dear?}
<C>__{cavalieri}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{in a harem.}
<C>__{cavalieri}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{a brothel.}
<C>__{cavalieri}
<D>__{oh!}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{a turkish brothel.}
<C>__{cavalieri}
<D>__{turkish? oh, if it's turkish, that's different. i want to be in it.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{my dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout vienna as a singing prostitute for a turk.}
<A>__{he seats himself at the forte piano.}
<C>__{cavalieri}
<D>__{oh. well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{perhaps.}
<A>__{he plays a chord. she sings a scale, expertly. he strikes another chord. she starts another scale, then breaks off.}
<C>__{cavalieri}
<D>__{what does he look like?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{you might be disappointed.}
<C>__{cavalieri}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{looks and talent don't always go together, katherina.}
<C>__{cavalieri}
<P>__{(airily)}
<D>__{looks don't concern me, maestro. only talent interests a woman of taste.}
<A>__{he strikes the chord again, firmly. cavalieri sings her next scale, then another one, and another one, doing her exercises in earnest. as she hits a sustained high note the orchestral accompaniment in the middle of martern aller arten from il seraglio comes in underneath and the music changes from exercises to the exceedingly florid aria. we dissolve : on the singer's face, and she is suddenly not merely turbaned, but painted and dressed totally in a turkish manner, and we are on:}
