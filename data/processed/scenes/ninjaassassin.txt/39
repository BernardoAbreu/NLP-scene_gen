<L>__{interior sabatin home day}
<A>__{sabatin and mika sit across from each other. the house has the chill of loneliness. tea has been set out between them.}
<C>__{mrs. sabatin}
<D>__{you said you read my husband's report, yes? what did you think?}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{i found it...illuminating. especially the references to the rihla. your husband quotes passages not found in battuta's present manuscript.}
<C>__{mrs. sabatin}
<D>__{my husband journeyed all over the world researching that report, but when he was home, he never spoke about it. he said it was safer that way.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{i understand the report caused some problems for him inside the kgb.}
<C>__{mrs. sabatin}
<D>__{the report caused "problems" for alexei's career the way moses caused problems for the pharaoh, you see? very unpleasant. terrible people saying terrible things.}
<A>__{she pours tea, the harsh memories still fresh.}
<C>__{mrs. sabatin }
<D>__{after he retired...was asked to retire...we moved, first to byelorussia and then here to berlin when the wall came down. he said this will be a good place to grow old together. and it was, for a time.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{what happened?}
<A>__{she looks off, shakes her head.}
<C>__{mrs. sabatin}
<D>__{about two years ago...two? yes, after the assassination of zhukov, the report drew attention. after that, everything was different.}
<A>__{flashback exterior sabatin home day as alexei supervises, workmen install locks, put in fencing material, hang lights and video cameras on the outside of the house.}
<C>__{mrs. sabatin }
<D>__{alexei hired men to change all the locks, and put in more of them. locks on the windows, locks on the doors, locks on the locks. he put in cameras and motion sensors and lights...everywhere, lights.}
<A>__{the lights snap on, illuminating the back of the house with brilliant klieg lights.}
<D>__{mrs. sabatin (v.o.) (cont'd) "there can be no shadows," he said. "no shadows."}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{closer on mrs. sabatin as she looks down at her tea.}
<C>__{mrs. sabatin}
<D>__{i will tell you a true thing, and a hard thing. my husband was a soldier. a member of russian intelligence. he had seen many terrible things....}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he was not a man to frighten easily.}
<C>__{mrs. sabatin }
<D>__{but from that day on, when the sun went down behind the hills...in his eyes, i saw the fear a child has of the dark.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{then, one day, a man came to the door.}
<A>__{flashback int exterior sabatin house day we are over the shoulder of someone who could be raizo or takeshi as the door opens revealing alexei. after a moment alexi invites the man in. a security camera watches them enter the house.}
<C>__{mrs. sabatin }
<D>__{they talked in alexei's study for sometime. then the young man left.}
<A>__{mrs. sabatin watches the young man leave then hurries toward the study door.}
<C>__{mrs. sabatin }
<D>__{it was unlike alexei not to see him out. i remember being very scared. but when i opened the door, he was just sitting there. for a moment, he didn't even notice me. then he stood up and kissed me and told me that he loved me very much. he said i should always remember that.}
<A>__{we see alexei looking shell shocked, eyes hollowed, as he stands and kisses his wife. his eyes begin to shimmer with tears but before he cries, he leaves.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{do you know what they talked about?}
<C>__{mrs. sabatin}
<D>__{no. alexei never spoke about it. but two months later, he was dead.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{can i ask how he died?}
<A>__{flashback exterior sabatin house night the lights have come on outside his house. alexei comes out, a gun in hand, shielding his eyes. searching for whatever set off the automatic lights. then, suddenly: darkness. and sudden movement in the shadows that lunges toward alexei. as mrs. sabatin shakes her head, looks away. shrugs.}
<C>__{mrs. sabatin}
<D>__{the lights went out.}
<A>__{she looks to mika. that says it all. she rises.}
<C>__{mrs. sabatin }
<D>__{you are the first person who has taken my husband's work seriously. it would be good to know that he did not die without cause. come with me.}
<A>__{mika follows her into an adjoining room, where mrs. sabatin pulls the bottom drawer of a bureau out and sets it on the floor. from the darkness she removes a metal box.}
<C>__{mrs. sabatin }
<D>__{he would want you to have this.}
