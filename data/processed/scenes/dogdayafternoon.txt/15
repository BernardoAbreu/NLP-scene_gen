<L>__{interior barber shop day}
<A>__{a cop is talking on the wall phone as moretti, baker, etc. are trying to get inside.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{...no, just get hold of al, tell him to get the catering truck over to 26th and avenue b, there's a bank robbery in progress and big crowd. big! tell him to bring ice cream i got to hang up.}
<A>__{he hangs up and immediately begins thumbing through a pocket phone book. throughout this cop is engaged in personal business on the fringe of this affair, and though he's on duty he hardly knows what's happening on the robbery. he's trying to get his brother in law with the ice cream truck down here, etc. moretti has got the crowd cleared back, so that now we see why this has been chosen as a tactical command post. from here, while talking on the phone, moretti can see the bank, and through the uncurtained door he can even see some distance inside. moretti picks up the phone.}
