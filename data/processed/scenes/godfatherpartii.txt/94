<A>__{a small gray alley cat is attracted to the young man, comes up to him and rubs itself against him. vito rubs the animal, speaking softly in sicilian, then, gaining its confidence, lifts it up and carefully lets it into fanucci's apartment. he steps back, holding the gun. we hear some italian shouted in the house; a loud sound from the cat, and some of the thumping footsteps of fanucci.}
