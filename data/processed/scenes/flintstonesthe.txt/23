<A>__{slate stands in a blubbering fury as lava mops coffee up from the model and slate's face.}
<C>__{slate}
<D>__{bankrupt? are you crazy?}
<A>__{lava holds up a clay tablet covered with figures.}
<C>__{lava}
<D>__{it's all here in hack and slice. when you committed to this housing development the price of dino kibble was a few clams per ton. since then, it's gone up a hundredfold.}
<P>__{(indicating the model)}
<D>__{you can't build a project like this without the heavy equipment dinos, and we can't afford to feed those dinos.}
<A>__{slate glowers, paces around the model.}
<C>__{slate}
<D>__{i'm two months behind schedule, my option's running out on the land and donald trumprock is just waiting to jump in and steal the whole deal ... meanwhile that damn union's on my back, hell, they'll probably want an eighty hour week or something...}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{there's got to be an answer...}
<A>__{a loud commotion outside the window attracts everyone's attention.}
<C>__{slate}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{lava}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{sounds like a worker's comp claim if i ever heard one...}
<A>__{all rush to the window. they look out and see the quarry wide supervised by fred, all the workers are straining on the ropes to haul the rear legs of the crane back into their sockets on the back of the big dino. only the last critical rope is still dangling.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{barney! grab that line! hurry!}
<A>__{barney scrambles up fred's back, shoving a foot in fred's face, but finally snatching the rope. he pulls on it... fred throws his own weight into the effort...}
<B>__{the crane}
<A>__{thuds into place on the dino's back the workers cheer }
<B>__{the wrecking ball}
<A>__{alas, with its cable now twisted shorter, it's become an immovable object, and as the shortened cable snaps, the wrecking ball begins to roll down the quarry wall.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{men and animals yelp and dive out of the way as the ball rolls downwards, smashing everything in its path.}
