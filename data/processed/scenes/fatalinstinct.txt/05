<L>__{interior bumper car pavilion night}
<A>__{...and drags a flustered man out of a bumper car, jumps in, and speeds away! a beat later, ned runs up, followed by arch. ned flashes his badge at a freckle faced kid in one of the bumper cars.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{police emergency! i need your car!}
<A>__{he pulls the kid out, jumps in, slaps a portable flashing red light on the dashboard... then speeds off after milo, a siren wailing! he zig zags through the crush of other bumper cars in the pavilion. ned's bumper car catches up with milo, pulling alongside. milo turns the wheel, ramming ned! ned rams him back, both bumper cars swerving violently... spraying sparks! ned slams milo's car again! milo loses control, spins out and smashes into the pavillion railing! ned swerves to avoid a collision, but rams into two other bumper cars, wrenching to a grinding halt. a beat. the airbag inflates in his bumper car. arch runs up as ned pulls himself from the wreckage. they turn to see milo leap from his mangled bumper car, leap over the pavillion railing and dash down the pier and into an alley between two buildings. a sign on the building says:}
<B>__{dead end alley.}
<A>__{ned and arch eye each other, shake their heads, and follow after milo.}
<B>__{omit}
<A>__{sequence from original script.}
<B>__{in the alley}
<A>__{milo runs into a tall chain link fence at the end of the alley and scrambles up the wire mesh. suddenly, ned's hand shoots out, grabs milo's ankle, yanking him down hard. milo jumps to his feet, swinging at ned, who catches milo's fist with his hand, stopping it cold... neatly snapping a handcuff on his wrist. he shoves milo's arm against the fence and snaps the other cuff to the chainlink. a switchblade flashes out of milo's other hand with a sharp click! milo slashes the blade at ned, just missing his face. on the backswing, ned parries with his own switchblade and flips milo's knife away. milo pulls a .45 calibre revolver with his free hand! ned shoves his finger into the end of the barrel. milo looks surprised... then sneers, clicking the hammer back.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{you take science in high school, milo?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{i skipped high school, cop!}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{then you're probably not familiar with the theory of inverse proportionate explosive dynamics.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{what about it?}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{if you fire a weapon with the barrel obstructed, the explosive force multiplies by twenty three point five nine eight and reverses on itself with diametric polarity?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{yeah. so?}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{the gun will blow up in your hand... and it won't even scorch my pinkie.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{ha! that's just theoretical hypothesis. inverse proportionate explosive dynamics has never been demonstrated conclusively in a laboratory environment.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{oh yeah. then pull the trigger, smart guy. let's find out.}
<A>__{milo hesitates, unsure. finally, he releases the gun. ned raises it up on the end of his finger. arch pulls it off with a loud pop! ned cuffs milo's hands behind him... spins him around.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{you have the right to remain silent... nexterior.. if you waive that right, anything you say... nexterior..}
<B>__{reveal arch}
<A>__{holding up a series of "cue cards"... as ned reads from them.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{...may be used against you in a court of law... nexterior.. you have the right to an attorney... do you have an attorney?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{nahhhh!}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{then today's your lucky day...}
<A>__{he flips out a business card, handing it to milo. angle the business card it reads... "ned ravine defense attorney"}
