<A>__{three white men walk along the trench unlocking the cage doors one by one... one by one, the black men emerge and stand in a line in the trench. when all are assembled, a second rifle shot signals them to climb out of the trench to the ground above. waiting for them above the trench, is one thousand feet of chain. each black man bends over and waits as the first man on line threads the chain through his leg iron, passing it to the second and so on... as they connect each other to the chain, camera pans down the line of men and while not a word is spoken, we hear their thoughts...thoughts to themselves, or, if possible, through their eyes to the man beside them:}
