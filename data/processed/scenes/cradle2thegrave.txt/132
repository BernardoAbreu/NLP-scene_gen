<A>__{vanessa notices something about the car. looks carefully. when... the car turns, giving the news chopper a better zoom angle of the people inside, and... vanessa sees daria, miles and tommy. which could mean only one thing: her daddy's safe. and soon he'll be coming to get her. with a rekindled hope inspired by her father's escape, vanessa now looks for a way to free herself from her duct tape bonds. when, just as it's about to seem hopeless again, her eyes go to... her necklace. the chain and pink diamond pendant. vanessa bends over and lowers her head until the necklace slides off onto the bed. then turns around and picks up the necklace behind her back. holding it as taut as she can between her hands, she begins sawing away at the tape around her wrists.}
