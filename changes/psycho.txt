<LOC>__{EXT. PHOENIX, ARIZONA - (DAY) - HELICOPTER SHOT}
<ACTION>__{Above Midtown section of the city. It is early afternoon, a hot mid-summer day. The city is sun-sunblanched white and its drifted-up noises are muted in blanched their own echoes. We fly low, heading in a downtown direction, passing over traffic-clogged streets, parking lots, white business buildings, neatly patterned residential districts. As we approach downtown section, the character of the city begins to change. It is darker and shabby with age and industry. We see railroad tracks, smokestacks, wholesale fruit-and- vegetable markets, old municipal buildings, empty lots. vegetable The very geography seems to give us a climate of nefariousness, of back-doorness, dark and shadowy. And secret. We fly lower and faster now, as if seeking out a specific location. A skinny, high old hotel comes into view. On its exposed brick side great painted letters advertise "Transients- Low Weekly Rates-Radio in Every Room." We pause long enough to establish the shoddy character of this hotel. Its open, curtainless windows, its silent resigned look so characteristic of such hole-and-corner hotels. We move forward with purposefulness and-toward a certain window. The sash is raised as high as it can go, but the shade is pulled down to three or four inches of the inside sill, as if the occupants of the room within wanted privacy but needed air. We are close now, so that only the lower half of the window frame is in shot. No sounds come from within the room. Suddenly, we tip downward, go to the narrow space between shade and sill, peep into the room. A young woman is stretched out on the mussed bed. She wears a full slip, stockings, no shoes. She lies in and attitude of physical relaxation, but her face, seen in the dimness of the room, betrays a certain inner-tension, worrisome conflicts. She is MARY CRANE, an tension, attractive girl nearing the end of her twenties and her rope. A man stands beside the bed, only the lower half of his figure visible. We hold on this tableau for a long moment, then start forward. As we pass under the window shade,}

<LOC>__{INT. THE HOTEL ROOM - (DAY)}
<ACTION>__{A small room, a slow fan buzzing on a shelf above the narrow bed. A card of hotel rules is pasted on the mirror above the bureau. An unopened suitcase and a woman's large, straw open- top handbag are on the bureau. On the table beside the bed there are a container of Coco- Cola and an unwrapped, untouched egg-salad sandwich. There is no radio. The man standing by the bed, wearing only trousers, T-shirt and sox, is SAM LOOMIS, a good-looking, sensual shirt man with warm humorous eyes and a compelling smile. He is blotting his neck and face with a thin towel, and is staring down at Mary, a small sweet smile playing about his mouth. Mary keeps her face turned away from him. After a moment, Sam drops the towel, sits on the bed, leans over and takes Mary into his arms, kisses her long and warmly, holds her with a firm possessiveness. The kiss is disturbed and finally interrupted by the buzzing closeness of an inconsiderate fly. Sam smiles, pulls away enough to allow Mary to relax again against the pillow. He studies her, frowns at her unresponsiveness, then speaks in a low, intimate, playful voice.}
<CHAR>__{SAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Never did eat your lunch, did you.}
<ACTION>__{Mary looks at his smile, has to respond, pulls him to her, kisses him. Then, and without breaking the kiss, she swings her legs over the side of the bed, toe-searches around, finds her shoes, slips her feet into searches them. And finally pulls away and sits up.}
<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I better get back to the office. These extended lunch hours give my boss excess acid.}
<ACTION>__{She rises, goes to the bureau, takes a pair of small earrings out of her bag, begins putting them on, not bothering or perhaps not wanting to look at herself in the mirror. Sam watches her, concerned but unable to inhibit his cheery, humorous good mood. Throughout remainder of this scene, they occupy themselves with dressing, hair-combing, etc.}
<CHAR>__{SAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.}
<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(soft sarcasm)}
<DIAL>__{What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?}
<CHAR>__{SAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(meaningfully)}
<DIAL>__{We could laze around here a while longer.}
<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(a small anguish)}
<DIAL>__{Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.}
<CHAR>__{SAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...}
<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(interrupting)}
<DIAL>__{When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.}
<CHAR>__{SAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You sure talk like a girl who's been married.}
<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sam!}
<CHAR>__{SAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm sorry, Mary.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(after a moment)}
<DIAL>__{My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.}
<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I've lost my girlish laughter.}
<CHAR>__{SAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(observing)}
<DIAL>__{The only girlish thing you have lost.}
<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(a meaningful quiet, then, with difficulty:)}
<DIAL>__{Sam. This is the last time.}
<CHAR>__{SAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{For what?}
<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.}
<CHAR>__{SAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?}
<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(about to argue, then turning away)}
<DIAL>__{I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.}
<CHAR>__{SAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy!}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(he laughs)}
<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...}
<CHAR>__{SAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(interrupting, seriously)}
<DIAL>__{You can't laugh at it, huh?}
<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Can you?}
<CHAR>__{SAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sure. It's like laughing through a broken jaw, but...}
<ACTION>__{He breaks off, his cheeriness dissolved, goes to the window, tries to raise the shade. It sticks. He pulls at it. It comes down entirely, and the hot sun glares into the room, revealing it in all its shabbiness and sordidness as if corroborating Mary's words and attitude. Sam kicks at the fallen shade, laughs in frustration, grabs on to his humor again.}
<CHAR>__{SAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And besides, when you say I make tax- deductible excuses you make me out a criminal.}
<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(having to smile)}
<DIAL>__{You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.}
<CHAR>__{SAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(goes close to mary, touches her)}
<DIAL>__{Next best thing to no conscience at all.}
<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(pulling away)}
<DIAL>__{I have to go, Sam.}
<CHAR>__{SAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I can come down next week.}
<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No.}
<CHAR>__{SAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?}
<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!}
<CHAR>__{SAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?}
<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sam! No!}
<CHAR>__{SAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(after a pause, simply)}
<DIAL>__{All right.}
<ACTION>__{She stares at him, surprised at his willingness to continue the affair on her terms, as girls are so often surprised when they discover men will continue to want them even after the sexual bait has been pulled in. Sam smiles reassuringly, places his hands gently on her arms, speaks with gentle and simple sincerity.}
<CHAR>__{SAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Mary, whenever it's possible, tax- deductible or not, I want to see deductible you. And under any conditions.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(a smile)}
<DIAL>__{Even respectability.}
<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You make respectability sound... disrespectful.}
<CHAR>__{SAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(brightly)}
<DIAL>__{I'm all for it! It requires patience and temperance and a lot of sweating- out... otherwise, though, it's only hard work.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(a pause)}
<DIAL>__{But if I can see you, touch you even as simply as this... I won't mind.}
<ACTION>__{He moves away and again the weight of his pain and problems crushes away his good humor. There is a quiet moment.}
<CHAR>__{SAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.}
<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(a smile)}
<DIAL>__{I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.}
<CHAR>__{SAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...}
<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I haven't even been married once yet!}
<CHAR>__{SAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.}
<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(smiling, then with a terrible urgency)}
<DIAL>__{Sam, let's go get married.}
<CHAR>__{SAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll have a lot of laughs. When I send my ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps.}
<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(a deep desperation)}
<DIAL>__{I'll lick the stamps.}
<ACTION>__{He looks at her, long, pulls her close, kisses her lightly, looks out the window and stares at the wide sky.}
<CHAR>__{SAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You know what I'd like? A clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on.  And the wherewithal to buy what I'd like.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(he moves away, suddenly serious)}
<DIAL>__{Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available.}
<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm thinking of it.}
<CHAR>__{SAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(a cheerful shout)}
<DIAL>__{How can you even think a thing like that!}
<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(picking up handbag, starting for door)}
<DIAL>__{Don't miss your plane.}
<CHAR>__{SAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{MARY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

Mary takes a dress from the closet and starts to put it on as the CAMERA RETREATS to reveal a packed but not yet closed suitcase also on the bed. Mary zips up her dress and then brings some final garments from the closet. She comes around to the suitcase and puts them on the top. Mary works with haste and in tension, as if acting on an impulse which might vanish as quickly as it came. The suitcase filled now, she checks around the room, then takes her handbag to the bed, puts in the money-filled envelope, and then slams the suitcase shut. Then filled she looks at her small bedroom desk, goes to it, removes a small file-envelope from one of the drawers. It is one of those brown envelopes in which one keeps important papers and policies and certificates. She checks its contents briefly, puts it on the bed, opens another desk drawer, takes out her bank book, tosses it on the bed. Then she packs both the file-envelope and the bank book, into her handbag, takes one quick last look around the room, picks up the handbag and the suitcase and goes out of the room.}

No one comes and for a moment Mary considers driving on, as if the emptiness of the station were a warning, an omen that she should listen to. But the gas registers almost empty.

He holds still, listens. He goes into the office and looks at the book. C.U. - THE NAME "SAMUELS" M.S. - NORMAN He goes back into the parlor with a mystified expression. The sound of Mary moving about her room come over, soft SOUNDS, somehow intimate in the night quiet. Norman turns his ear from the direction of the SOUNDS, seems to be fighting an impulse to listen, or more than listen. But slowly, he is forced to surrender to the impulse and, resisting himself, he goes to the wall, presses the side of his head against it. The SOUNDS come louder, as if we too had our ear pressed against the wall. Now Norman looks at a picture hanging on the far end of the wall he is leaning against. Slowly he starts toward it. He reaches it, touches it, reluctantly lifts the small frame off the wall. A tiny circle of light hits Norman's face, coming from the hole in the wall behind the picture. This end of the room is very dim and thus we are able to see clearly the light striking Norman's face. We move close to Norman, extremely close, until his profile fills the screen. The tiny spot of light hits his eye. See the small hole through which the light comes. Norman peeps through. NORMAN'S VIEWPOINT Through the hole we look into Mary's cabin, see Mary undressing. She is in her bra and halfslip. She stoops over a bit, places her hands behind her upper back, begins to unhook her bra. NORMAN - ECU He watches as Mary removes her bra.

In another spot we see a figure which matches the balance in her bankbook; 624.00. Beneath this is the figure 500, and the amount after subtraction, 124.00. She studies the figures, sighs, not wearily but with a certain satisfaction, with the pleasure that comes when one knows that at any cost one is going to continue doing the right thing. After a moment she tears the page out of the notebook and, rising, begins to rip it into small pieces. She goes into the bathroom, drops the pieces into the toilet bowl, flushes the toilet. Then she drops her robe and steps into the tub and turns the shower on.}

There is still a small worry in her eyes, but generally she looks somewhat relieved. Now we see the bathroom door being pushed slowly open. The noise of the shower drowns out any sound. The door is then slowly and carefully closed. And we see the shadow of a woman fall across the shower curtain. Mary's back is turned to the curtain. The white brightness of the bathroom is almost blinding. Suddenly we see the hand reach up, grasp the shower curtain, rip it aside.}

CAMERA FOLLOWS away from the body, travels slowly across the bathroom, past the toilet, out into the bedroom. As CAMERA approaches the bed, we see the folded newspaper as Mary placed it on the bedside table. CLOSE UP - THE NEWSPAPER beside the bed.

Norman presses his eyes, fights to find a way out of his dilemma. Slowly, a kind of settling comes upon him, the peace that comes with decision. Norman rises, goes to the window, looks out, and then, with resolution, closes the window and draws the curtain across it.

He spreads the curtain so that one end of it comes up against the bathroom threshold and slightly over and onto the tile floor. Again he goes into the bathroom and CAMERA TILTS up so that we see only the upper half of Norman. He works carefully, with his arms extended away from his body, slowly pulls the dead body out of the tub, drags it across the tile floor and onto the spread-out shower curtain in the bedroom.

He closes the lid then, but does not lock it. He comes back into the cabin, closes the door completely, flicks on the light. Again the newspaper is in the foreground. For a moment he pauses, closes his eyes against the realization of what he is doing, then quickly pushes all thoughts away, continues with his work. With the room lighted, he now proceeds to gather up all Mary's articles and toss them into the suitcase. He checks all drawers and the closet, gets down and checks under bed and bureau, goes into the bathroom, checks that room again, comes back into the bedroom, looks about carefully, spots Mary's handbag, throws even that into the suitcase, is finally satisfied that all traces of the girl are gone from the room.

He returns to cabin. As he enters, his eye is caught by the newspaper on the bedside table. He goes to it, takes the newspaper, and looks once again into the bathroom.

He looks at the swamp, seems doubtful of its ability to swallow up the car, realizes he has no choice. He leans into the car, releases the emergency brake, starts to push. The front of the car begins to roll into the swamp. Suddenly there is the LOW, THROBBING SOUND of a motor. Norman freezes, listens. The SOUND grows louder and Norman realizes it is an airplane flying overhead. The car is rolling quickly now. Norman jumps away, slams the door shut, stands tense.

After a moment, Norman's hand comes into shot, picks up hose, places it in a new position. As CAMERA PULLS BACK, we see that the water from the hose has erased and rearranged the road markings so that it would be impossible to tell that a car had been parked here. After a short wait, Norman goes to the hose-faucet, turns it off, unscrews the hose. As he rolls the hose, he walks away from the spot, past the office, heading for the path that leads to the house.

To her left is another door, half-open. Directly before her is a third door, closed. She holds a long moment, trying to picture in her mind which room would look out on the front of the house, decides, chooses the correct door, the one on her right. She goes to it, knocks lightly.}

She stands on the threshold, looking in at the room, instantly disturbed by it, almost chilled, her expression indicating an impulse to close the door and go away from this room forever. After a moment, she enters, leaving the door open behind her. CAMERA PULLS BACK AND AWAY and we now see the room as Lila sees it. It is ornate, damask-and-mahogany, thick and warm and ripe, an olla podrida of mismated furnishings and bric-a-brac of the last century. The bed is four poster, but uncanoped; the dressing table is fancy and flounced with satin; there is a great chiffonier, a big-doored wardrobe, a large, oval, full- length pier-glass (this against the wall directly opposite the door), a satin recamier, an upholstered armchair by the window, a white marble fireplace, its grate cold but piled with ashes. And there is in the room an unmistakably live quality, as if even though it is presently unoccupied, it has not been long vacated by some musty presence. Lila glances at the bed. The damask coverlet is thrown over it, but it is not neat, there is the imprint of a body on it, a body which obviously has slept in a curled-up, womb- like position. Lila stares at it for a moment, up, then goes to the dressing table. Its top is scattered with boxes and jars of cosmetics and creams, traces of fresh powder, an opened bottle or perfume, a comb, and a brush with traces of hair in its bristles. Lila moves on, catches a glimpse of herself in the pier-glass, is startled, turns away, goes to the chiffonier, is about to open a drawer, sees the high wardrobe out of the corner of her eyes, goes to it, hesitantly. She opens one door. Fresh, clean, well pressed dresses hang neatly. Lila opens the other door. The sweaters and dresses and robes hang freely, none in moth-proof, storage- type bags. There is even a well-brushed collar of foxes. Along the floor of the wardrobe is a line of clean, polished shoes. Lila stares, then closes the door, turns, looks once again over the whole room, starts out,}

The walls are fancied with romping silhouettes of teddy-bears and sailboats and carousels and fat cows jumping over aghast moons. The bed is small, far too short for a man of Norman's height. And yet the rumpled covers indicate that it is in this bed that Norman sleeps. Next to the bed is an old-fashioned toy chest. On its top there are a bird-in-a-cage lamp, a plain-bound book, and an ash tray filled with ashes and cigarette stubs. A grown man's shirt hangs on a child's clothes tree. Against one wall there is a narrow, high bookcase filled with thick, unchildish-looking books. On the small, white chest of drawers there is an old, child's victrola. The record on the turntable is discovered, on close inspection, to be Beethoven's Eroica Symphony. Lila studies the room, fascinated and repelled. She glances at the bookcase, comes into the room, goes to the bookcase and pulls out a thick, large, plain-bound book. She opens it. Her eyes go wide in shock. And then there is disgust.

He seems about to smile, when suddenly all expression vanishes from his face, and he appears to enter a no-place, no-time state. He crosses to the stairway, goes up. Lila remains crouched on the basement stairs, listening to the SOUNDS of Norman. His footsteps on the stairs followed by the fast noises of doors opening, of fast moving about an upstairs room. Convinced that he is searching the upstairs for her, she decides to chance an escape. She starts up the steps, is about to turn into the hallway when her eye is caught by a glimmer of light down in the basement. She pauses, looks down, sees the crack of light coming from behind the not entirely closed door to the fruit cellar. The swift moving SOUNDS of Norman continue to come from upstairs.
