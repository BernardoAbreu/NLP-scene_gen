<A>__{tomoko and masami run down the staircase, through the hallway towards the kitchen. tomoko cries out again just before they reach the kitchen.}
<C>__{tomoko}
<D>__{masami!}
<L>__{interior ouishi household kitchen night}
<A>__{masami has come to a halt before a phone mounted on the wall. she pauses, looking slowly at her friend, then back to the phone. she takes it tentatively from its cradle, answers it wordlessly. the tension continues to mount as nothing is said. masami suddenly breaks into a huge grin.}
<C>__{masami}
<D>__{ill put her on.}
<A>__{still grinning, she hands the phone to tomoko. tomoko snatches it quickly.}
<C>__{tomoko}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{yes?}
<A>__{she is silent for a moment, then smiling widely.}
<C>__{tomoko}
<D>__{oh, man!}
<A>__{she is so relieved that all the strength seeps out of her and she sinks to the kitchen floor. masami, equally relieved, slides down the wall and sits down next to her.}
<C>__{tomoko}
<P>__{(on the phone)}
<D>__{yeah, ive got a friend over now. yeah. yeah, ok. bye.}
<A>__{tomoko stands to place the phone back in its wall cradle, and then squats back down onto the kitchen floor.}
<C>__{tomoko}
<D>__{the games gone into overtime, so theyre gonna be a little late.}
<A>__{they burst out laughing with relief again, and are soon both clutching their stomachs.}
<C>__{tomoko}
<D>__{jeeezus, my parents...}
<C>__{masami}
<D>__{oh man, im tellin everybody about this tomorrow!}
<A>__{tomoko shakes her head, dont you dare .}
<C>__{masami}
<D>__{im gonna use your bathroom. dont go anywhere.}
<C>__{tomoko}
<D>__{k.}
<A>__{masami walks out of the kitchen. alone now, tomoko stands and walks toward the sink, where she takes a glass from the dish rack. she then goes to the fridge and sticks her face in, looking for something to drink. suddenly there is the sound of people clapping and cheering. tomoko, startled, peers her head over the refrigerator door to check for the source of the sound. she begins walking slowly, following the sound to the dining room adjacent the kitchen.}
