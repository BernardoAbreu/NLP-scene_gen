<A>__{jake stand's with miles in the sparse living room. big ai's body sits reclining on a lazy boy chair, eyes bulging open. an open carton of food rests in his lap. a feast of take out chinese surrounds him. the tv blares an old episode of "the little rascals." there's a singed, neat bullet hole in his forehead.}
