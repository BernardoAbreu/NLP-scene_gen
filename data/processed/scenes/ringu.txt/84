<D>__{sadako was alive! shed tried to climb her way out.}
<A>__{ryujis face twists into a grimace as if momentarily experiencing sadakosterrible agony. he waits a moment longer before edging his way down the rope again, finally splashing to rest at the bottom of the well. he holds his flashlight above the brackish water, calls up to asakawa.}
