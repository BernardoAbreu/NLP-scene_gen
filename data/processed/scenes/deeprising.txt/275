<A>__{finnegan cuts the motor of the jet ski. slides up next to trillian. grabs her by her arm. rips her out of the water. throws her onto the back of the jet ski. just as a tentacles rises up, lashing out. he guns it. smashes through the waves. the warhead splashes through the water. the jet ski hauls ass.}
<B>__{engines whining out.}
<A>__{faster and faster. a huge geyser of water explodes in front of the jet ski. a tentacle slaps down hard. finnegan cuts hard. too late. the jet ski ramps through the geyser. they and the jet ski tumble and splash across the water. the}
<B>__{saipan charges forward.}
<A>__{twenty five meters away from hitting the fuji maru. no twenty meters away. now fifteen. finnegan pops to the surface. looks around. can't find trillian. he dives under the water. his pov: tentacles converging on him from the murky depths. the "retrieve" feature that's on all jet skis forces it back around towards where finnegan and trillian fell off. finnegan burst to the surface. holding trillian. she looks nearly lifeless. the jet ski heads right at them. finnegan swims for it. dragging trillian. as tentacles converge from all sides. the jet ski is suddenly sucked under the water! swallowed whole. finnegan quickly reverses. backstrokes like mad. the warhead slices through the water. now only ten meters away from hitting the fuji maru. now nine meters away. now eight. seven. six. five. go into slo mo now as: finnegan paddles hard. sucking in as much water as he is air. a tentacle rises up out of the water. looms above finnegan and trillian. dripping water. about to strike. there's nowhere to hide. finnegan paddles harder. come out of slow mo as: the tentacle starts its downward lunge. and that's when the saipan rams the fuji maru. the warhead slams into its hull. ba whoooooommm!! the saipan evaporates.}
<B>__{metal flies. water sprays.}
<A>__{fire fills the night sky. the top deck of the fuji maru cartwheels across the waves. the tentacle above finnegan drops like lead. and just lies there. quivering. another explosion. lifts the remains of the fuji maru out of the sea. sends shock waves across the water. blows finnegan's hair back. he swims on. towards the island. pulling trillian. the remains of the saipan and the fuji maru smolder and sink. bubbles explode to the surface. a couple dozen small fires dot the waves. water sizzles and steams. smoke drifts into the night sky. debris coats the water.}
