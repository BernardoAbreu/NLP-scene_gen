<L>__{exterior courtyard, the potala day}
<A>__{it is a beautiful, blue sky day. the dalai lama is learning "debate". high lamas sit on tapestry pillows, under appliqued canopies, observing. young monks can be seen, watching, from a greater distance. the lord chamberlain sits to one side. taktra rinpoche, now regent, is beside him. the dalai lama sits on the ground at ling's feet.}
<C>__{ling rinpoche}
<D>__{how does one progress from the realization of one noble truth to another?}
<P>__{(clap)}
<A>__{a long silence from his holiness. the lamas wait on tender hooks. finally, the boy says:}
<C>__{tenzin gyatso}
<D>__{we will have to think about that.}
<A>__{there is laughter. even ling rinpoche laughs and the boy erupts into his beautiful, free, easy laugh.}
<C>__{tenzin gyatso}
<D>__{i need to squeeze this brain.}
<C>__{ling rinpoche}
<D>__{answer.}
<P>__{(clap)}
<A>__{a pause, and then:}
<C>__{tenzin gyatso}
<D>__{when one understands that he causes some of his own suffering, needlessly, then he looks for the causes in his own life. and when and he looks for those causes, when he investigates, then he is putting confidence in his own ability to eliminate the sources and end the suffering. a wish to find a path to peace arises. for all beings desire happiness. all wish to find their purest selves.}
<A>__{ling nods in approval. he looks to the elders.}
<C>__{ling rinpoche}
<D>__{i accept it.}
<A>__{taktra rinpoche and the lord chamberlain are proud.}
