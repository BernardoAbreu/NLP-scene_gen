<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior alley same night}
<A>__{a brilliant white glare stabs into the alley mouth as an lapd cruiser glides slowly by on the street. the search light illuminates the figure of reese, crouching over the sprawled drunk, just pulling on the other's trousers. the cruiser chirps to a stop. the doors fly open and two cops leap out.}
<C>__{first cop}
<D>__{hold it, right there!}
<A>__{reese hitches his pants and bolt like a shot. the cops draw their guns and race into the alley after him. handheld camera or panaglide, rushing with reese along the narrow alley. he vaults a pile of tumbled trashcans. whips around a corner. leaps the hood of a parked car in the cross alley. panaglide preceding cops, as they snake through the night maze.}
