<L>__{exterior carnival day}
<A>__{a loudspeaker playing percy sledge's "when a man loves a woman," as we see a carnival in the distance with a ferris wheel turning round and round. a black man is by a stall. on his arm is an irish girl with blond hair. the black man is drunk, and is tossing rings around a bowling pin.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{and that's cricket, hon.}
<A>__{an attendant hands him the teddy bear. it looks ridiculous in his huge hands. he gives it to the girl.}

<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{jody}

<D>__{don't run off, jude.}
<C>__{jude}
<D>__{you don't know me, do you?}
<A>__{jody walks inside the canvas flap and vanishes from sight. we can still see his hand, holding jude's. she leans against the canvas, looking bored.}

<P>__{(inside)}
<D>__{what if i did?}
<C>__{jude}
<D>__{you'd know i wouldn't run off.}
<A>__{she stands there, listening to the sound of him urinate. her eyes flick around the carnival. they settle on a tall dark haired man in a dark jacket. he nods.}

<C>__{jude}
<D>__{you didn't?}

<D>__{i never know nothing.}
<C>__{jude}
<D>__{people. they could be looking.}

<D>__{come and get me, soldier }
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{whatever you say, jude...}
<A>__{he sinks down on his knees toward her. she wraps her arms around his neck and kisses him. jody writhes on top of her, fumbling with his belt. jude cocks one eye upward. a shadow falls across them. close on jody, kissing her. a gun is put to his head. he turns around, drunkenly.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{what the fuck }
<A>__{the gun whacks him across the cheek and he falls sideways. jude scrambles to her feet and darts like an animal through a field. jody feels his cheek. he can see her blond head vanishing among the fields. he looks up and sees a group of men around him. the tallest of them, fergus, cocks the gun.}
<L>__{interior car day}
<A>__{a mini, driving down a country road. two men in the front, three in the back. on the floor of the car jody lies, with three pairs of feet on top of him, a black bag over his head and the barrel of a gun dangling close to his face. fergus holds the gun. he is smoking a cigarette. his movements are slow and somewhat innocent.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{so what's your name, soldier?}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{yeah.}
<L>__{exterior small farmhouse evening. interior farmhouse night.}
<A>__{jody pulled through and tied to a chair. maguire, a small lean man, talks to him through the hood.}
<C>__{maguire}
<D>__{the situation is simple. you're being held hostage by the irish republican army. they've got one of our senior members under interrogation in castleraigh. we've informed them that if they don't release him within three days, you'll be shot. you'll be treated as our guest until further developments. have you anything to say?}
<A>__{jody is motionless under the black hood.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{give him a cup of tea.}
<C>__{maguire}
<D>__{do you want a cup of tea?}
<A>__{he still says nothing.}

<C>__{jude}
<D>__{do you want some food?}
<A>__{jody sits as still as a grave, saying nothing.}
<T>__{dissolve:}
<A>__{late at night it is dark. the men are sleeping. fergus is sitting by a chair, gun in his hand, watching the prisoner. jude comes in, with a flashlight.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{hey what's he like?}
<C>__{jude}
<D>__{horny bastard.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{did you give him it?}
<C>__{jude}
<D>__{there are certain things i wouldn't do for my country.}

<D>__{can't.}
<C>__{fergus}

<C>__{jude}
<D>__{he's all right.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{hasn't moved for twelve hours. go on. have a heart.}
<A>__{she moves over to him. she prods him in the legs with her foot. he doesn't move. then she lifts the hood ever so slightly, to peer inside. suddenly the man moves like lightning, jerking his head down so the hood comes off, throwing his body, tied to the chair, over jude.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{you fucking bitch you fucking whore }
<A>__{he pins her to the ground, his body bent with the chair. he writhes on top of her in a grotesque parody of love. she is screaming and the room is alive, each man awake, grabbing guns, screaming.}
<C>__{maguire}
<D>__{turn the fucking thing off }
<L>__{exterior farmhouse night.}
<A>__{fergus follows jude out a back door, holding her by the arm.}

<C>__{jude}
<D>__{and you know what, fergus? one of you made me want it...}
<A>__{she puts her lips to his neck.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{which one?}
<A>__{she doesn't answer. they embrace.}
<L>__{exterior farmhouse morning.}
<A>__{a hot summer's day. there are tall hedges all around the house. fergus leads jody, still bound and hooded, over toward a greenhouse.}
<L>__{interior greenhouse day}
<A>__{dusty tomato plants and vines everywhere. broken glass. the sun pouring through. fergus leads jody over to a wrought iron chair and sits him in it. he sits opposite, gun on his lap. fergus takes some sandwiches out of a brown paper bag. he holds one out toward him.}

<D>__{eat something, would you?}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{can't.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{what do you mean you can't?}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{can't eat through a canvas bag.}
<A>__{fergus walks over to him, lifts the hood up so his mouth is revealed, and pushes the sandwich toward his lips. jody eats, slowly.}

<C>__{maguire}
<D>__{you'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{maguire}
<D>__{and do you know why?}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{maguire}
<D>__{because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why.}
<A>__{maguire goes back to the house.}
<L>__{interior greenhouse day}
<A>__{jody sitting with the hood on again. fergus enters.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{they giving you trouble, fergus?}
<A>__{fergus says nothing. he takes a plate and brings it toward jody}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{it happens. y'see, there's two kinds of people. those who give and those who take.}
<A>__{fergus lifts up jody's hood to expose his mouth and begins to feed him.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{ah, take the thing off, man.}
<A>__{fergus says nothing and keeps feeding him.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{it's okay. i understand. don't mind if i prattle on, do you?}
<A>__{fergus shakes his head and says nothing.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{i will take it by your silence that you don't.}
<A>__{he eats. fergus feeds himself, then feeds more to jody.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{two types, fergus. the scorpion and the frog. ever heard of them?}
<A>__{fergus says nothing.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{scorpion wants to cross a river, but he can't swim. goes to the frog, who can, and asks for a ride. frog says, "if i give you a ride on my back, you'll go and sting me." scorpion replies, "it would not be in my interest to sting you since as i will be on your back we both would drown." frog thinks about this logic for a while and accepts the deal. takes the scorpion on his back. braves the waters. halfway over feels a burning spear in his side and realizes the scorpion has stung him after all. and as they both sink beneath the waves the frog cries out, "why did you sting me, mr. scorpion, for now we both will drown?" scorpion replies, "i can't help it, it's in my nature."}
<A>__{jody chuckles under his hood.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{so what's that supposed to mean?}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{means what it says. the scorpion does what is in his nature. take off the hood, man.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{'cause you're kind. it's in your nature.}

<C>__{jody}
<D>__{i've often wondered how you do it.}

<A>__{fergus, standing across the road from the pub. he is sweating. dil comes out of the pub. she looks this way and that, as if searching for fergus. fergus stands back into a shadow. dave, the burly man, comes out. he grabs her by the elbow. she shrugs him off. she walks off. dave follows, grabs her by the elbow again. the sense of an old argument. dave suddenly strikes her across the face with his open palm. she leans her head against a wall. dave then puts his arms around her, consoles her.}
<L>__{exterior street night.}
<A>__{dave walking, holding dil by the arm. the street is dilapidated, full of squats. they stop outside a door. dil opens the door with a key from her purse and they both walk inside. fergus stands there, observing. a light comes on in an upstairs room. dil enters; we see her shadow in silhouette behind the curtain and the shadow of dave coming in behind her. he begins to remove her blouse. she stands absolutely still as he does so. fergus backs away, then walks off.}
<L>__{interior hostel night.}
<A>__{fergus, in bed. fade to black as we see jody as a bowler, running in slow motion, toward the camera. he releases the ball; we see fergus in bed, breathing heavily.}

<L>__{interior metro night.}
<A>__{it is now crowded with people, black, white, punky and street chic, a lot of leather all the women are heavily made up. someone is singing from the tiny stage and rows of cheap colored bulbs are flashing around it. from the way fergus walks through, it is obvious he has never been here at night. he seems most out of place in his cheap suit, making his way through the crowd to the bar.}
<B>__{at the bar.}
<A>__{fergus looks through the odd crowd, but can't find dil. col, the barman, sees him and smiles.}

<C>__{col}
<D>__{no, no. it's on me.}
<A>__{fergus tries to pretend he's familiar with the drink, and by implication, whatever are the norms of the place. he lifts the glass to his mouth, but the umbrella keeps getting in the way.}

<B>__{at the bar.}
<A>__{fergus looks up. close up of dil's hand, as music begins, making movements to the music. we see dil, standing on a stage, swaying slightly. she seems a little drunk. she mimes to the song. she mouths the words so perfectly and the voice on the song is so feminine that there is no way of knowing who is doing the singing. she does all sorts of strange movements, as if she is drawing moonbeams with her hands. the crowd seems to know this act. they cheer, whether out of approval or derision we can't be sure. fergus watching. dil singing, noticing him. she comes to the end of the song. the crowd cheers. fergus, watching her make her way through the crowded bar, toward him.}

<L>__{interior metro night.}
<A>__{the place is hopping. fergus enters. he now sees it as he should have seen it the first night as a transvestite bar. he makes his way through the crowds. all the women too heavily made up. some beautifully sleek young things he looks at he realizes are young men. he makes his way to the bar where dil is sitting, nursing a drink with an umbrella in it. her face is bruised. she is wearing dark glasses. as he walks toward her she sees him in the mirror. she talks to col the barman.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{he's back, col}
<C>__{col}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{dil}

<A>__{fergus, walking outside dil's place. the blinds in her room are down and the light is on inside. we see her outline, pacing up and down behind the blinds, smoking a cigarette. we hear the song "the crying game." fergus stands beneath her doorway, scribbles a note, and sticks it in the letter box.}

<L>__{interior site day}
<A>__{fergus, fitting a new window into the finished wall. on the pitch we see the cricketers, distorted through the moving glass of the window. across the pitch dil walks, with a lunch basket in her hand, dressed in a very short skirt with high heels. as she approaches the site a chorus of whistles breaks out. fergus, hearing the whistling, stares out. he sees dil moving toward the site. he drops the window and the glass shatters. as the whistles continue, we see dil in the site's lift, which rises up. we see deveroux and franknum climbing up a ladder toward fergus .}
<C>__{deveroux}
<D>__{how much did that frame cost, mr. franknum?}

<D>__{i'm sure you do, mr. deveroux.}
<C>__{deveroux}
<D>__{bloody right i do...}
<A>__{through this conversation fergus can hear the chorus of wolf whistles increasing. he looks out the gap where the window should be and sees dil in the lift. the laborers whistle at her, looking up her skirt, etc. she passes by a gap in the wall and blows a kiss at him.}

<D>__{is that his tart? does pat have a tart?}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{she's not a tart.}

<D>__{no, of course not, she's a lady.}
<C>__{fergus}

<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{what you doing here?}

<D>__{see, i was always best looking after someone. must be something in the genes.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{must be.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{and the fact that you didn't know is basically the fault of yours truly. and even when you were throwing up, i could tell you cared.}

<D>__{do it on your own time, paddy.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{deveroux}
<D>__{whatever it is she does for you.}

<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{if i was her i'd consider that an insult.}
<C>__{deveroux}
<D>__{consider it how you like. just get that bloody tart out of here.}
<A>__{fergus stands up suddenly. he speaks quietly.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{did you ever pick your teeth up with broken fingers?}
<A>__{deveroux stares, suddenly chilled.}
<C>__{deveroux}
<D>__{what's that supposed to mean?}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{it's a simple question.}
<A>__{deveroux says nothing. fergus looks down to dil.}

<C>__{gent}
<D>__{pardon me, young man }
<A>__{fergus walks on. jude, from the cafe, watches fergus walking on, the old man being eased with painstaking care inside the daimler. then the door closing and the daimler pulling off. when the daimler has passed fergus, he turns around and walks back. jude smiles and leaps up as he approaches.}

<C>__{dil}
<D>__{you was there, wasn't you? you used those tits and that ass to get him, didn't you?}
<A>__{fergus screams from the bed. he rips free his other arm. dil shoots jude in the throat, and she falls dead, covered in blood. dil turns the gun on fergus.}

<A>__{she looks at the picture; walks over and sits down in front of it.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{you won't let me, jody }
<A>__{she raises the gun and places it in her mouth. fergus takes it gently from her mouth and places it on the table. he lifts her up by the shoulders.}

<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{yes. say hello to col }
<A>__{he leads her out the door. fergus goes back into the room, past jude's body. looks out the window to where he can see dil staggering down the street, through the crowds that have gathered. the wail of police sirens coming closer. he watches dil run off, with her funny walk. then looks down and sees the cop cars pushing through the knot of people around the house. he picks up the gun, wipes it with a rag to remove dil's fingerprints. he turns to the picture of the soldier; talks to it.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{you should have stayed at home.}
<A>__{he sits in the chair by the window, waiting.}
<T>__{fade to black:}
<L>__{interior prison visiting room day}
<T>__{fade up :}
<A>__{to reveal a large interior, with light streaming in the windows. large barred doors open and a group of women come through, with parcels, children in tow, etc. among them is dil, looking resplendent. she walks past the rows of convicts with their families, up to a glass cage, where fergus sits, waiting.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{got you the multivitamins and the iron tablets, hon }
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{don't call me that }
<C>__{dil}

<C>__{dil}
<D>__{can't help it. you're doing time for me. no greater love, as the man says. wish you'd tell me why.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{as the man said, it's in my nature.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{what's that supposed to mean?}
<A>__{she shakes her head.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{well, there was this scorpion, you see. and he wants to go across the river. but he can't swim. so he goes to this frog, who can swim, and he says to him, "excuse me, mr. froggy..."}
<A>__{camera pulls back, and as fergus tells the story of the scorpion and the frog, the music comes up "stand by your man."}
