<L>__{interior raymond's private office campaign hq dusk}
<A>__{huge posters featuring raymond's face, emblazoned with secure tomorrow, stacked against the wall. a desk covered with papers and enough take out chinese food for ten people, and raymond sits behind it, nursing a glass of wine, and pointedly ignoring melvin's notebook, while:}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{i kill mavole?}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{it's a dream }
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{ could mean something else.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{ could be i'm just supposed to think you did.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{ i killed the enemy. i didn't know them, either. so it was okay. and, anyway, i remember what we did in kuwait, i remember it perfectly. but now that you mention it, i don't remember doing it ... exactly.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{maybe you didn't.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{no. what a thought.}
<A>__{now he picks up the dream book. marco watches. raymond flips through the pages for a moment, dismissively. then stops at something melvin has drawn. frowns. raises his eyebrows. closes it, sets it down:}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{life is so bizarre, isn't it? this absurd campaign, the sordid world of politics, my whole public life and persona sometimes, occasionally, for an instant, the fog clears and i look and i think, what am i doing? i mean, what the fuck am i doing? posing and grinning like a goddamn sock puppet, shaking hands with total strangers who must be blind if}
<C>__{raymond }
<D>__{they can't see what i am, at the core. what my mother has made me.}
<A>__{raymond looks steadily at marco ... who nods, interested:}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{a prentiss. ferociously, a prentiss but not a shaw, god forbid i was molded by cold hard hands, every detail of my existence preordained. can you even imagine, ben, how it would feel never to have a say in what your life would be? i was twenty years old before i had a friend no, worse, a girlfriend well, almost but, yes, a friend, or i thought so outside my mother's circle of approved encounters and it didn't she wouldn't precipitating my one act of rebellion, storming off and enlisting }
<P>__{(grimaces)}
<D>__{ in the army. which, ironically, only served ultimately to pad my gilded prentiss resume. you know: "fluent in five languages, phi beta kappa, congressional medal of honor, blah blah blah."}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and after the war i came back to her. and the family legacy. this. mother calls it, "fulfilling my manifest prentiss destiny."}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{why did you come back, raymond? what happened?}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{seeming startled, raymond's reverie is broken. his eyes harden as he refocuses on marco.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{weren't you listening? mother happened.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{you know, the truth is, i hate it. i've always despised it.}
<C>__{marco}
<P>__{(lost)}
<D>__{which?}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{the medal. the cloying adulation of the little people. your pitiful jealousy }
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{who said i was jealous?}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{i don't have the dreams, ben.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{how can you not remember saving the unit?}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{i do. i said i did.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{you said you don't remember doing it.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{ha ha, don't mix me up, i'm tired, and fine. it's like this. it's as if i know what will happen, ben, but i never get to the part where i feel that it actually did happen. but i think that's probably perfectly normal.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{did you ever talk to anybody about this little discrepancy?}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{what? no. who would i ask? my old army "buddies," who love and adore me for saving their pathetically unimportant present company excluded asses?}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{no. you ask army intelligence.}
<P>__{(getting excited)}
<D>__{look, we can go together, tomorrow. you tell them what you just told me, everything you do remember, what you don't "exactly" remember, about kuwait, let 'em run some tests on you }
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{i'm sure the press would have a field day with that.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{raymond. they put an implant in me. i found it yesterday. maybe they put one in you.}
<C>__{raymond}
<P>__{(horrified)}
<D>__{nobody's put anything in me.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{great. let's prove it. we can go get an x ray we can check it right now }
<A>__{marco moves toward him, raymond backs away }
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{i want to be supportive of you, ben, i do, but }
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{just check your back, raymond }
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{ this can wait until after the election.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{what are you afraid of? see if there's a bump.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{you should leave. this is not, this is not }
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{ just check }
<C>__{raymond}
<P>__{(without checking)}
<D>__{there's nothing there!}
<A>__{marco lunges at raymond they fall, together, over the desk, onto the floor chinese food scattering.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{somebody was in your head, with big steel toe boots, a couple of cable cutters and a chainsaw, and they went to town! neurons got wasted, circuits rewired, brain cells obliterated }
<A>__{knocking at the door:}
<C>__{anderson }
<D>__{congressman shaw?}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{ you don't even know what they did! you don't you can't conceive what they did to you and you're worried about some lame ass reporters!?}
<A>__{ where marco (stronger, better trained) wraps raymond in a headlock, rips raymond's shirt from the shoulder }
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{if i'm wrong they can put me the fuck away }
<C>__{anderson }
<D>__{ are you okay?}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{ben }
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{ there there's something }
<A>__{insistent knocking at the door. marco claws at the skin on raymond's back sinks his teeth in raymond shakes him off, and marco slams into the wall. the office door bangs open anderson and other agents swarm marco there's blood smeared on marco's mouth, his jaws are clenched }
<C>__{anderson}
<P>__{(disbelief)}
<D>__{he bit him.}
<P>__{(at raymond)}
<D>__{sir, did he bite you?}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{marco shoved to the floor twisted handcuffed blood smearing across the carpet his eyes wild with adrenaline and fear raymond his hand goes to his back his eyes lock with marco's for an instant then marco is hustled out the door.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{sir }
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{nothing happened!}
<A>__{horrified campaign workers crane necks to see inside. mute with shock, raymond pulls his hand away from his back. hides the blood.}
