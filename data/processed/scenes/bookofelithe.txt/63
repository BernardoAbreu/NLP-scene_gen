<D>__{a whole convoy of armed degenerates, that's what's wrong! coming here for them! and they led them right to us!}
<A>__{martha rushes to the window, pulls aside the lace curtain. outside she sees the armored vehicles screeching to a halt. the men spill out from the vehicles and take cover behind them, locking and loading weapons.}

<D>__{oh no they don't...}
<A>__{she rushes across the room, teeth gritted with determination.}

<C>__{george}
<D>__{how about you, you know how to }
<A>__{eli is already reloading his shotgun, checking the barrel. readying the weapon in the practiced manner of an expert.}

<D>__{never mind.}
