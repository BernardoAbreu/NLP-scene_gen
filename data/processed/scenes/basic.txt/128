<L>__{interior fort mckinley officer's club night}
<A>__{several hours and bourbons later, hardy sits at the bar, drunk and alone. out of place, the only one not in uniform. osborne walks in, locates hardy, and strides over to the bar, a sheaf of papers under her arm. her face, stoic.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{we need to talk }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{seven.}
<A>__{he takes a slug of his drink.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{seven guys. what was it you said? you were "just starting to believe i wasn't the guy people said".}
<A>__{he chuckles.}
<P>__{hardy {cont'd)}
<D>__{seven. that's the answer to kendall's question. how many? seven.}
<A>__{osborne looks at him. realizing what he's saying.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{this isn't the time }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{this is the perfect time. you know what makes a good detective? the number of confessions they get. you're a good detective, osborne. so now you get mine.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{what if i don't want it?}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{tough.}
<A>__{he pours himself another drink.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{thing about taking money is, you don't have to do anything. you just sit there. maybe you don't return a phone call. maybe you don't follow up a lead. but that's it. keep the money, your work's done.}
<A>__{osborne stares at him.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{seven unsolved murders. and you know what? it didn't weigh on my conscience. not one goddamn bit.}
<A>__{he takes a slug from his glass and grimaces.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{that's not true.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{there are degrees of truth, officer. always degrees.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{you're a good man, hardy.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{really.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{far as i'm concerned, whatever you did in the past can stay in the past.}
<A>__{hardy stares at her.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{i may not be growing on you, but you're sure as hell growing on me.}
<A>__{he motions to the bartender for another glass, but osborne takes his hand, stopping him.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{and because you're a good man, i know you'll do the right thing.}
<A>__{hardy looks at her, questioning. osborne takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{pike never made it to d.c.. somebody took him off the plane before it left. my guess is he's already dead.}
<A>__{hardy stares at her.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{west?}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{nobody saw. but i don't think so.}
<A>__{she puts the papers on the bar.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{these are the requisitions from the px, the ones used to release the drugs to mueller. west signed half of them pike was telling the truth. look who signed the other half.}
<A>__{she taps the bottom of the paper. hardy, not wanting to believe it. he looks up at her, pained.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{do i have a choice in this?}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{yeah. i can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.}
<A>__{hardy stares at his glass. deciding.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{fuck it. let's go finish this.}
