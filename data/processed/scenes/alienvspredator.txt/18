<A>__{lex stands alone on the deck, thinking and watching. above the night sky a powerful x class flare erupts from the sky, accompanied by a halo coronal mass ejection.}

<P>__{(dry and precise)}
<D>__{it's in the upper atmosphere. streams of protons and electrons from the sun are deflected by the earth's magnetic field causing a solar radiation storm.}
<A>__{lex turns to see sebastian and miller. they join her on the deck, one on each side of her. miller has his camera out.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{it's beautiful. even the way you describe it, professor.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{actually, it's doctor.}
<P>__{(to lex)}
<D>__{and i agree.}
<A>__{lex looks up at the sky and is reflective.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{shackleton called antarctica the 'last great journey left to man.' it's the one place left in the world that no one owns, that's completely free.}
<P>__{(a beat; a smile)}
<D>__{me? i'm sort of partial to the penguins.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{i wish you'd reconsider coming with us?}
<A>__{she looks at him. smiles. but shakes her head. miller leans in, pretends to share a secret.}
<C>__{miller }
<D>__{not for me. obviously. but i think a lot of the other guys really need you.}
<P>__{(off lex's look)}
<D>__{c'mon, don't make me pull out pictures of my kids again.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{your kids aren't that cute.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{what if we got pictures of other people's kids? would that do it?}
<A>__{lex smiles. miller's humor and sebastian's charm is a tough combination.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{want my advice? stay on the boat.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{we're not staying on the boat.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{guys, the first rule of this job is to not take people to places they're not ready to go.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{listen, i was on the next plane to mexico. my team's waiting. but if weyland's even half right, this could change history.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{weyland is more concerned with making another billion than with anything else. including your safety.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{let me ask you something. you're here. you know this place. do we stand a better chance of surviving with you than with the number two choice?}
<A>__{from lex's look, it's clear that they do.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{because if we do and you don't go, and something goes wrong, are you going to be able to live with that?}
<C>__{rousseau }
<D>__{ms. woods.}
<A>__{lex turns to see rousseau standing there.}
<C>__{rousseau }
<D>__{your helicopter's refueled. they're waiting for you.}
<A>__{we hold on lex, still undecided.}
