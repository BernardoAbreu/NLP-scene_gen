<C>__{desk sergeant}
<D>__{i don't understand why you had it parked on the waterfront. you're staying at the doral and you lose your car somewhere out by the brooklyn bridge.}
<C>__{la valle}
<D>__{in point of fact, m. devereaux is scouting locations for a film for french television. he left the car to look at some point of interest.}
<C>__{devereaux}

<P>__{(doing rough figures on a piece of scratch paper)}
<D>__{what was the weight of the car when you got it, irv?}
<C>__{mechanic}

<C>__{russo}
<P>__{(consulting lincoln specification book)}
<D>__{you're sure?}
<P>__{(he does quick addition)}

<D>__{when it was booked in at marseilles it weighed the same. 120 pounds overweight. jimmy has to be right.}
<A>__{the three men turn again to stare at the lincoln. the mechanic lowers the hoist, thoughtfully.}
<C>__{mechanic}
<D>__{i ripped everything out except the rocker panels.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{they look at each other for a long moment. mechanic starts to undo the side rocker pans. jimmy pulls the pan off and sticks his arm into the enclosure. feeling around inside he pulls out the first kilo sized plastic container as several others start tumbling out after. buddy and doyle are smiling at each other as they continue to pull the bags out. several of the other mechanics in the garage are gathered around the happy moment. they repeat this action on the other side of the car. russo enters garage sergeant's bullpen. devereaux and la valle are still arguing with the sergeant.}

<C>__{russo}
