<A>__{chef sits down in a seat behind garrison near the back. general plymkin, a gruff old army type with bug eyes, steps up to a podium and addresses the troops.}
<C>__{general plymkin}
<D>__{pay attention!}
<A>__{the crowd settles down.}
<C>__{general plymkin}
<D>__{it's no secret that the evil canadian federation has scored major victories all over the united state. we have brought you here because you ar america's best, and last hope.}

<C>__{general plymkin}
<D>__{oh... apparently you're not the best, you're simply the last. anyway, let's strategize... map!}
<A>__{a large, holographic 3 d map of south park springs up in front of him. he walks around it pointing out things with a laser pointer.}
<C>__{general plymkin}
<D>__{our sources have told us that the canadians might try to attach tomorrow's uso show and stop us from executing terrance and phillip.}
<A>__{he points to a spot on the 3 d map.}
<C>__{general plymkin}
<D>__{now each battalion has a specific code name and mission. battalion 5, raise your hands }
<A>__{chef is in battalion 5 and dutifully raises his hand. then he looks around and notices to his surprise that everybody else in his section is also african american.}
<C>__{general plymkin}
<D>__{you will be the all important first defense wave, which we will call 'operation human shield'.}
<C>__{chef}
<D>__{hey, wait a minute...}
<C>__{general plymkin}
<D>__{now keep in mind, 'operation human shield' will suffer heavy losses. but don't lose your spirit men! stay until the bitter end. battalion 14?}
<A>__{a bunch of white guys raise their hands.}
<C>__{general plymkin}
<D>__{right, you are 'operation get behind the darkies'. you will follow battalion 5 here }
<A>__{he points to a spot on the 3 d map.}
<C>__{general plymkin}

<A>__{chef raises his hand.}
<C>__{general plymkin}
<D>__{yes soldier?}
<C>__{chef}
<D>__{have you ever heard of the emancipation proclamation?}
<C>__{general plymkin}
<D>__{i don't listen to hip hop.}
<A>__{chef scowls.}
<C>__{general plymkin}
<D>__{if you somehow live, we will regroup on this hill outside }
<A>__{suddenly, the 3 d hologram starts to flicker and fizzle.}
<C>__{general plymkin}
<D>__{now what's wrong with this thing?}
<A>__{general plymkin messes with the controls.}
<C>__{general plymkin}
<D>__{fucking windows 98!}

<C>__{general plymkin}
<D>__{you told us windows 98 would be faster and more efficient with better access to the internet!!!}
<C>__{bill gates}

<A>__{plymkin pulls out a gun and shoots him in the head. gates falls to the floor, dead.}
<C>__{general plymkin}
<D>__{alright men, get lots of rest, and prepare thyselves for battle!}
