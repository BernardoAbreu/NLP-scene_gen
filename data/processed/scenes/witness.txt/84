<A>__{book's holstered gun and bullets at center table. eli sits on one side, a chastened samuel on the other. rachel looks on from the b.g. eli knows that this is as important a dialogue as he will ever have with his grandson: at issue is one of the central pillars of the amish way.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{the gun that gun of the hand is for the taking of human life. would you kill another man? eh?}
<A>__{samuel stares at it, not meeting his grandfather's eyes. eli leans forward, extends his hands ceremonially.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{what you take into your hands, you take into your heart.}
<A>__{a beat, then samuel musters some defiance.}
<C>__{samuel}
<D>__{i would only kill a bad man.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{only a bad man. i see. and you know these bad men on sight? you are able to look into their hearts and see this badness?}
<C>__{samuel}
<D>__{i can see what they do.}
<A>__{now he meets eli's eyes:}
<C>__{samuel}
<D>__{i have seen it.}
<A>__{eli expels a deep sigh; then:}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{and having seen, you would become one of them?}
<P>__{(intent... gesturing)}
<D>__{don't you see...? the hand leads the arm leads the shoulder leads the head... leads the heart. the one goes into the other into the other into the other... and you have changed, and gone amongst them...}
<A>__{he breaks off, bows his head for a moment. then he fixes the boy with a stern eye and, driving he heel of his palm firmly into the tabletop with enormous intensity:}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{"wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate, saith the lord!"}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(indicating pistol;}
<D>__{continuing from}
<P>__{corinthians 6:17)}
<D>__{"and touch not the unclean thing!"}
<A>__{his intensity tinged with righteous anger, he is hugely impressive.}
