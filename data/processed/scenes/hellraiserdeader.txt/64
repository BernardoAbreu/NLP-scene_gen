<L>__{interior psych ward common area day}
<A>__{blank walls lit with flickering fluorescent lighting. there's a tv hanging from ceiling in the corner showing time lapse photography of a blooming rose (a little homage to the original hellraiser.) we move to find a various assortment of patients, but none of them are watching the tv, they're too busy entertaining themselves and their invisible friends. amy enters cautiously, feeling a little threatened by the other patients. she looks around, not sure where she should plant herself and then she sees her a little girl (age 6) sitting off by herself in the corner of the room drawing pictures. a few of them (a half human half monster clawing at a closet door, a child screaming, a child running from the monster, a child holding a butcher knife, etc.) are taped on the wall behind her. amy walks over to her. there's just something about her.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{mind if i join you?}
<C>__{little girl}
<D>__{please. i'm drawing pictures.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i can see that, they're lovely.}
<C>__{little girl}
<D>__{want me to draw your picture?}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i'd like that very much.}
<A>__{the little girl stares at amy and focuses in on her features. we can't see what she's drawing as her little hand starts to move across the sketch pad. but there's something a little off. her hand doesn't move like a six year old would draw, it moves with the confidence and control of an adult's. amy tries to get a glance at the portrait. the little girl pulls it close to her.}
<C>__{little girl}
<D>__{no peaking.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i'm sorry, you're right.}
<A>__{with a few more strokes the drawing is complete. the little girl studies it, pleased with herself. she spins it so amy but not the audience can see it. close on amy her eyes wide with terror.}
<C>__{little girl}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<A>__{amy's pov as we get our first good look at it. it's amy's face as a cenobite, twisted and stretched in a way that begins to reveal the skull around her dark empty eyes. there's also that nasty knife wound in the center of her chest with hooks stretching the skin back and to the side.}
<C>__{little girl }
<D>__{i only draw what i see... amy.}
<A>__{amy backs away from her, trembling.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{how do you know my name?}
<A>__{the little girl giggles. amy turns to the other drawings that the little girl has taped to the walls.}
<B>__{t}
<A>__{hey too now all look like cenobites, some look like deaders, one looks just like winter...}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{no... this isn't happening.}
<A>__{amy gets up to run but then she freezes when she sees marla sitting on the opposite side of the room. but here's the thing. she looks fine. amy walks over, hesitant, confused.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{marla?}
<A>__{marla doesn't seem to recognize her.}
<C>__{amy }
<D>__{marla! you're alive.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{you say that like it's a good thing.}
<A>__{marla takes a long quiet look around the room and then leans in close, unable to keep up her charade.}
<C>__{marla}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{you know he's watching us.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{who?}
<B>__{s}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{winter. this is where he sends all the trouble makers. tries to show us who's boss. tries to make us believe.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{so it is real?}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{as real as you want it to be. we all have our own version of the truth, some are just more screwed up than others. but you wouldn't know that, because you still don't know the truth.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{you will. you see that's the pointerior all this, "deaders", "cenobites", whatever you want to call it, it's all about solving the puzzle. part of that puzzle is you. finding the secrets that are hidden within you.}
<A>__{marla pokes a finger at amy's heart. right on her wound.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{ in there. and as soon as you find that, as soon as you face it, you'll be free. once and for all.}
<A>__{he pulls back into her chair.}
<C>__{marla }
<D>__{me i'm still looking.}
<C>__{a}
<C>__{my}
<D>__{but what is it all for?}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{ultimate pleasure more than anyone, even those who have solved the puzzle before us, have ever known. conditions of the nerve endings the likes of which your imagination could not hope to evoke.}
<A>__{marla stares at amy deeply. the breaks into a smile.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{...at least that's what they say.}
<A>__{marla looks around the room to see if anyone is watching her and then she takes amy's hand and leans in close.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{problem is winter can't solve the puzzle. only a few chosen ones with just the right amount of depravity and loneliness in their soul can.}
<P>__{beat)}
<D>__{so he's been on this quest for years, searching for that mythical person who is both willing to join us and can also solve the puzzle. and it would seem, amy klein, that that person is }
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{me.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{bingo baby. sorry.}
<A>__{she's trying to give amy a clue without tipping off anyone who might be watching her.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{he has to be there for you amy. and he will be. like he was for all of us. that's the key. without him, you can't come back. it's you he wants. its you he needs. remember that above all.}
<A>__{marla looks down at amy's chest. amy follows her stare to find blood starting to soak through her hospital gown. amy's eyes begin to glaze over.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{looks like you're running out of time.}
<A>__{amy leaps up from the table and suddenly marla is gone. in fact the whole room is empty and dead quiet. a pool of blood lies beneath her seat. she staggers a bit as she moves forward.}
