<D>__{i want to ask you something...}
<A>__{william pulls out the photograph of his brother, holds it up...}
<C>__{william }
<D>__{this is my brother. his name is christopher. he was stolen by the rebels.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{do you know if he is alive?}
<A>__{the rebel looks at the photograph but says nothing, just shakes his head... and he looks off, his thousand yard stare inscrutable... and william simply folds the photograph back up and slips it into his pocket... but he doesn't leave... he sits here a moment longer... quietly... thinking... and then...}
<C>__{william }
<D>__{were you taken when you were young like me?}
<A>__{the rebel hears this and turns to him... and nods his head...}
<C>__{william }
<D>__{do you remember your parents?}
<A>__{and we see something happening in this hardened rebel... his eyes filling with a distant memory... a sadness... and slowly he nods his head again. and we stay here with these two lost souls sitting next to each other... silent... connected by a shared history and anguish.}
