<L>__{interior symington's office day}
<A>__{frances is alone in the room. the door is ajar. she's standing over symington's desk, which is empty except for a doodle pad. the doodle she's looking at is extremely bizarre, sadistic... after a moment, symington enters holding several folders. frances' manner changes very subtly.}
<C>__{symington}
<D>__{...i'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. did you enjoy your mother's visit?}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(sitting)}
<D>__{yes. it was very good to see her.}
<C>__{symington}
<D>__{really? any problems?}
<A>__{symington puts the folders in a drawer. all except frances'.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{not at all. she brought me my fan mail.}
<P>__{(a performance)}
<D>__{i had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. but i guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. you make so many friends. i want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.}
<C>__{symington}
<D>__{you're telling me you feel guilty.}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(slightly edgy)}
<D>__{no... what i mean is... i'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.}
<C>__{symington}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{symington}
<D>__{she told me you said, "mama, you want to kill me."}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{i never said... oh look. that's just a figure of speech. she said something funny, and i said...}
<C>__{symington}
<D>__{and you accused her of tampering with your mail.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{oh for christ's...}
<A>__{frances is wrapping and unwrapping a handkerchief around her knuckles. looks a little crazy. symington's watching it. she stops.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{i'm sorry. she misunderstood, that's all.}
<C>__{symington}
<D>__{but you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. whom do you think i should believe?}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{doctor, i hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.}
<C>__{symington}
<D>__{frances, you're still filled with anxiety. you feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. consequently, i didn't recommend your release at the staff review.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{you what?}
<C>__{symington}
<D>__{mental illness is an elusive thing, and though i'm pleased you're feeling more... capable, it's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time. don't you agree?}
<A>__{frances stares at him. stunned. horrified.}
<C>__{symington}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{dr. symington, how big is your dick?}
<C>__{symington}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{'cause if it's long enough, which i doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!}
<A>__{symington smiles patronizingly.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{i want outta here, you understand? i'm ready to get out! so you go back there... you go back and you tell them to let me out!}
<C>__{symington}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{frances, i'm warning you...}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{no, i'm warning you! who do you think you are, god? you bumble around with your folders...}
<P>__{(she knocks her folder to the floor)}
<D>__{...and your pencils...}
<P>__{(she grabs some pencils}
<D>__{and throws them at}
<P>__{him)}
<D>__{...and your god damn buttons...}
<P>__{(she pounds on the}
<D>__{inter com; a voice}
<P>__{says, 'yes, doctor?')}
<D>__{...all your badges of authority! but you have no authority! you're nothing! you're a zero!}
<A>__{she tears open the door. two huge orderlies are waiting. frances tries to barrel past, but they easily restrain her.}
<C>__{orderly}
<D>__{doc?}
<A>__{symington sits forward, his hands smoothing his hair. frances smiles sarcastically at him:}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{symington says...}
<C>__{symington}
<P>__{(tonelessly)}
<D>__{sedate her.}
<A>__{they haul her away.}
