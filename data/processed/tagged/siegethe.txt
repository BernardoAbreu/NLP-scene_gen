<C>__{frank}
<D>__{okay, here we go...}
<C>__{hub}
<P>__{(on the phone)}

<B>__{the sound of sirens}
<A>__{slowly bleeds in through the white noise mercifully for us, and for hub, who wipes his mouth and looks up, realizing that his hearing is coming back. he reaches for frank's outstretched hand and stands, albeit woozily.}

<A>__{but the look in frank's eyes says it all.}
<B>__{the devastation}
<A>__{is numbing. images we associate with other countries. and then he sees elise. her face is cut and bleeding, but as their eyes meet, her look is one of absolute compassion.}

<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{the army is a broadsword not a scalpel. you do not want us in an american city.}

<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{we only go if the president invokes the war powers act.}
<C>__{chief of staff}
<D>__{i understand that, general. let us imagine, though, for a moment, that the order has been given.}
<A>__{close on devereaux. as he weighs his remarks, we flashcut, almost imperceptibly to:}

<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{...twelve hours after the president gives the word we can be on the ground. one light infantry division of ten thousand seven hundred men. elements of the rapid deployment force combined with special forces delta. apc's, tanks, helicopters. and of course, the ubiquitous m 16a1 assault rifle, a humble weapon until you see a man carrying one outside your local bowling alley or seven eleven. it will be noisy, it will be scary and it will not be mistaken for a vfw parade.}
<A>__{back to the anonymous room where the same anonymous hands lift a cotton shroud. we watch in slow motion as it drifts down a shoulder. back to the situation room}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{that means civilian casualties. at a minimum it's a drunk private joyriding in a hummer who runs down an old lady in greenpointerior at a maximum...}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{make no mistake. we will hunt the enemy. we will find the enemy. and we will kill the enemy.}
<A>__{back to the anonymous hands turning the key in an ignition. an engine rumbles to life. back to the situation room}
<C>__{devereaux}
<P>__{(looks at them)}
<D>__{and no card carrying member of the aclu is more deadset against it... than i am. which is why i urge you... no, i implore you not to consider this option.}
<A>__{a long beat. the chief of staff sighs.}

<D>__{i know what the president will say.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{chief of staff}
<D>__{that's exactly why you're the only man for the job.}
<A>__{back to a van emerges from a dark garage like a beast from a cave. back to the situation room the army general speaks up.}
<C>__{army general}
<D>__{i remind you general devereaux does not speak for official army policy. a police function has become accepted as our role in haiti, in somalia }

<D>__{ could i interrupt?}
<A>__{everyone looks over at hub. devereaux smiles.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{that's anthony hubbard, fbi. he's the asac on the ground up there. they took out the first cell less than 36 hours after bus 87. i suggest we hear what he has to say }
<A>__{he nods to hub, who acknowledges the vote of confidence.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{there is something you probably haven't thought about doing?}
<C>__{chief of staff}
<D>__{and that is ?}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{nothing. don't over react.}
<P>__{(off their incredulity)}
<D>__{with all respect, gentlemen, i'm just a cop. to you these people may be martyrs, but to me they're criminals. and a criminal is no more than somebody who thinks he's better than everyone else. and he's not better. he only has to be wrong once. and that's where we come in. we run down a tip from a landlord, or we pick up a latent print from a bus. our phones are ringing off the hook with people from the arab community wanting to help.}
<A>__{he measures his words carefully. unaccustomed to these kind of august circumstances.}
<C>__{hub}
