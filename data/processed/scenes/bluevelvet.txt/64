<A>__{jeffrey, detective williams, and an old coroner's officer are looking at the ear, which is sitting in a medical dish on a table.}
<C>__{coroner's officer}
<D>__{the tests will take awhile. meanwhile, we'll check the morgue records. i don't recall anything coming in minus an ear.}
<A>__{the coroner's officer turns to jeffrey.}
<C>__{coroner's officer}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{now if you'd found a jaw or let's say, a heart, or even an arm, we would assume that there was a corpse, however, a finger or an ear. the person may very well be alive somewhere.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{what can you tell about the person from the ear?}
<C>__{coroner's officer}
<D>__{well. when the tests are done, quite a lot . sex, blood type, whether or not the ear came off a dead person. right now, i know what you know. it's a real human ear. the human was, or is, caucasian. . also. it looks like the ear was cut off with scissors.}
