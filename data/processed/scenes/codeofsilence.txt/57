<L>__{interior headquarters office day}
<A>__{kosalas, without an attorney, is being interviewed by partida. a court stenographer is silently typing.}
<C>__{partida}
<D>__{...you have the right to remain silent. you have the right to have an attorney present at all times. anything you say may be used against you in a court of law...}
<L>__{interior eddie's car day}
<A>__{eddie and kosalas are parked on an airport access road, watching private planes land and take off. eddie's car, a five year old chevy, is wreckage. the quarter panels are rusted, the radio antenna is a coathanger, and when kosalas pushes a tape into the cassette player, the windshield wipers start moving. kosalas pops the cassette out, the windshield wipers stop; he throws the cassette into the glove compartment. but now he can't get the door to stay closed.}

<D>__{i'm going to have to fix that.}
<A>__{eddie has to shout to be heard over the sound of an airplane passing directly overhead. eddie glances at kosalas who looks uncomfortable.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{you know, it's kind of interesting. that 16 year old in the hallway with the gun? partida told me he doesn't have a record. the kid's never been arrested.}
<C>__{kosalas}
<D>__{yeah, well, you know, if you read the papers, cops only shoot honor students. sole support of the family and all that.}
