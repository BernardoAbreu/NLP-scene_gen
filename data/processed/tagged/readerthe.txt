<A>__{michael is sitting on the steps of the first landing. then, as if from nowhere, hanna is suddenly standing behind him, in uniform, carrying a box of coal in one hand, a scuttle in the other. she looks tired but not surprised to see him.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{there are two more buckets downstairs. you can fill them and bring them up.}
<A>__{hanna walks straight past him. for a moment he tenses as if there might be some contact. but she goes by.}
<L>__{interior cellar. day}
<A>__{michael opens the door. he turns on a dim light. there is a flight of wooden stairs into the murk of a huge pile of coke, poured in from the street. he goes down to the bottom, and picks up a bucket. he digs in to the coke, and at once it comes tumbling down on him in a cloud of dust.}
<L>__{interior hanna's apartment. day}
<A>__{hanna is at the kitchen table, drinking a glass of milk. she has taken off her jacket and loosened her tie. michael comes in with the two buckets of coal, his face and clothes filthy. she roars with laughter, full throated.}

<A>__{michael sees himself in the mirror, but she has already got up, going towards the tub in the corner of the kitchen.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{you can't go home like that. give me your clothes, i will run you a bath.}
<A>__{hanna opens the tap. there's a boiler, and steaming hot water comes out. michael takes off his sweater, then stops.}

<D>__{what, do you always take a bath in your trousers?}
<A>__{hanna takes his sweater and goes to open the balcony door. he undresses. she puts his sweater on the balcony rail.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{it's all right, i won't look.}
<A>__{on the contrary, she turns and walks straight towards him. michael is naked. hanna takes his clothes from the chair. he gets into the bath. she goes to the balcony. in the bath, he submerges himself. hanna goes out and shakes his clothes out in the open air. when he comes up from under the water, she is laying his clothes back on the chair. she picks up the shampoo and hands it to him.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{wash your hair, i will get you a towel.}
<A>__{michael washes his hair, then submerges again. when he comes back up, hanna is holding out a large towel. he gets out, turning away to hide his erection. from behind, she wraps his body and rubs him dry. then she lets the towel fall. she puts her body against his back, and he realises she's naked. he turns and faces her.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{so. that's why you came back.}
<A>__{michael looks at her, awed.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you're so incredibly beautiful.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{now, kid, you know that's not true.}
<A>__{at once she puts her arms round him and they kiss. michael goes down onto the floor, hanna on top of him. all the time, she's staring into his eyes. he can't take it. he closes his eyes and, about to come, begins to scream. she puts her hand over his mouth to smother the noise.}
<L>__{interior dining room. berg apartment. night}

<C>__{michael}
<D>__{it's hardly my fault, i got lost, that's all. that's why i was late. can i have some more?}
<A>__{he reaches for more stew. thomas goes on eating, a look of contempt on his face, too superior to engage in this.}

<C>__{michael}
<D>__{the doctor told me i had to take walks.}

<D>__{you joined the ss in 1943?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{what was your reason? what was your reason for joining?}
<A>__{hanna doesn't answer.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{you were working at the siemens factory at the time?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{you'd recently been offered a promotion. why did you prefer to join the ss?}
<A>__{hanna has a defence counsel, a young man, beside her, who is about to get up. but the judge forestalls him.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{i will re phrase my question. i'm trying to ascertain if she joined the ss freely. of her own free will.}
<A>__{everyone waits.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{i heard there were jobs.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{go on.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{i was working at siemens when i heard the ss was recruiting.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{did you know the kind of work you'd be expected to do?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{they were looking for guards. i applied for a job.}
<A>__{michael is intent now, so are the students beside him.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{and you worked first at auschwitz?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{until 1944. then you were moved to a smaller camp near cracow?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{rohl leans into michael.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{are you ok?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i'm fine.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{you then helped move the prisoners west in the winter of 1944 in the so called death marches?}
<L>__{interior train. day}
<A>__{michael is hanging out of the window of the train, smoking a cigarette.}
<L>__{interior train. day}
<A>__{michael sits down in his seat. rohl moves to sit opposite him.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{so what did you think?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i don't know. it wasn't quite what i expecting.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{wasn't it? in what way? what were you expecting?}
<A>__{rohl is looking at him. michael doesn't answer.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{i thought it was exciting.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{exciting?}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{why? why did you think it exciting?}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{because it's justice.}
<L>__{exterior countryside. day}
<A>__{the train hurtles through the german countryside.}
<L>__{interior student digs. night}
<A>__{a student party, in a candle lit room. marthe is singing to a guitar. it's been going on for hours the students are on the floor with beer and cigarettes. the front door is open. dieter, beer in hand, looks out to the balcony where he can see michael bent away from them, all by himself.}
<L>__{exterior student digs. night}
<A>__{michael, his arms on the balcony, is smoking, looking out into the night. his eye lands on a student room in which a couple are making love.}
<L>__{interior lecture room. heidelberg law school. day}
<A>__{the small student group is now rattling around informally in the big lecture room.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{i need to correct an impression. dieter said yesterday this was about justice. but is it?}
<C>__{rohl }
<D>__{if it were about justice you might ask why has it taken so long? the war ended twenty years ago. remember, there've been no significant trials between nuremburg in 1946 and the auschwitz trials a couple of years ago. that's a long gap. what's the reason for the gap?}
<A>__{rohl waits a moment for a student to answer.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{i'd have thought it was obvious.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{say.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{cowardice. it's cowardice, isn't it? it's bad conscience. it's the big cover up.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{go on.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{after the war. the german people didn't want to look at what they'd done.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{is that right?}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{because they had too much to hide. all our parents are liars. all right, mine are. so it's left to us, isn't it?}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{how so?}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{because we're not implicated.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{aren't you? good. so that's all right then.}
<A>__{everyone laughs.}
<C>__{marthe}
<D>__{no, but seriously, dieter's right. my parents, i can't even talk to them. i don't love them. how could i? how could anyone love them? because they've told themselves so many lies, they can't remember the truth, let alone admit it. isn't that why we signed up for this seminar?}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{i don't know. you tell me.}
<C>__{marthe}
<D>__{speaking for myself.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{michael?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i'm not sure any more.}
<A>__{rohl is staring at him thoughtfully.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{what did your father do, dieter?}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{if you want to know, he was in the waffen ss.}
<A>__{there are some smiles, but dieter rides over the reaction.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{that's what i mean, that's what i'm saying. so were a million other germans.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{that's exactly my pointerior that's why it's better not to pretend this is about justice. forgive me, nor is it about getting into an emotional state. it has no purpose if it's just the young giving their parents a bad time.}
<A>__{there's a silence. that's clearly why some of them are there.}
<C>__{marthe}
<D>__{so what is it about? what do you think?}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{societies think they operate by something called morality. but they don't. they operate by something called law. you're not guilty of anything merely by working at auschwitz. 8,000 people worked at auschwitz. precisely 19 have been convicted, and only 6 for murder. to prove murder you have to prove intent. that's the law. remember, the question is never `was it wrong?' but `was it legal?' and not by our laws, no, by the laws at the time.}
<A>__{dieter frowns, unhappy.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{but isn't that...}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{narrow?}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{yes. the law is narrow.}
<A>__{rohl looks unapologetic.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{on the other hand, i suspect people who kill other people tend to be aware that it's wrong.}
<L>__{interior courtroom. mannheim. day}
<A>__{rohl is leaning forward, attentive. hanna is standing, opposite the judge, who holds up a book called mother & daughter : a story of survival.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{miss schmitz, you're familiar with this book...}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{yes...}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{parts of it have already been read out in court.}
<C>__{judge }
<D>__{it's an american publication, which has been translated. it's by a survivor, a prisoner who survived, ilana mather...}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{yes i know. i know ilana mather.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{she was in the camp, wasn't she, when she was a child? she was with her mother.}
<A>__{the judge waits. hanna seems arrogant, defiant.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{in the book, she describes a selection process. at the end of the month's labour, every month, sixty inmates were selected. they were picked out to be sent from the satellite camp back to auschwitz. that's right, isn't it?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{yes, it's right.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{and so far, each of your fellow defendants has specifically denied being part of that process. now i'm going to ask you. were you part of it?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{there is a stir among the other defendants and in the court. they start talking to their lawyers.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{so you helped make the selection?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{you admit that? then tell me, how did that selection happen?}
<A>__{hanna shrugs slightly, as though it were obvious.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{there were six guards, so we decided we'd choose ten people each. that's how we did it every month. we'd all choose ten.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{are you saying your fellow defendants took part in the process?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{we all did.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{even though they've denied it? but you admit it. you're saying you took part in the process.}
<A>__{the other defendants stir with animosity, but the judge is intent, following his own line.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{did you not realise you were sending these women to their deaths?}
<A>__{he waits. hanna nods slightly.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{yes but there were new arrivals, new women were arriving all the time, so of course we had to move some of the old ones on.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{i'm not sure you understand...}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{we couldn't keep everyone. there wasn't room.}
<A>__{the judge frowns, genuinely surprised that she doesn't seem to understand his pointerior}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{no, but what i'm saying : let me rephrase : to make room, you were picking women out and saying `you you and you have to be sent back to be killed.'}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{well, what would you have done?}
<A>__{hanna is looking at the judge a perfectly straight question. michael smiles slightly, proud of her. everyone in the court waits for the judge to answer. silence. rohl is impassive. but hanna follows her own thoughts. she quietly asks herself a question.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{so should i never have signed up at siemens?}
<L>__{interior lobby. town hall. day}
<A>__{michael is alone, smoking. on a bench, side by side, are two women. one is very small, dark, in her sixties. the other is composed, formidable, elegant, in her thirties. rose and ilana mather. they look up, catching michael's eye. then a clerk leans in to the younger woman.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{ms. mather, they're ready for you now.}
<A>__{the two women go into the court. the door closes.}
<L>__{interior lobby & courtroom. day}
<A>__{michael is alone in the now deserted lobby, unwilling to go back. then he goes to the door. he opens it a little. the sound of the trial. he opens the door fully. michael can see that it is ilana who is testifying. the court is conspicuously packed. large black and white photographs of the labour camp now dominate the room. michael comes quietly into the back of the room as the trial goes on. michael has pushed past a couple of people to sit down near rose who is sitting in the body of the court. he looks across to the defendants. rita beckhart, a large older woman, is one of a couple who isn't bothering to listen.}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{in your book you describe the process of selection...}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{yes. you were made to work and then, when you were no longer any use to them, then they sent you back to auschwitz to be killed.}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{are there people here today who made that selection?}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{i need you to identify them. can you please point them out?}
<A>__{ilana points with her finger at the defendants.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{her. and her. and her. and her. and her. and her.}
<A>__{the last finger has been to hanna. michael watches, but hanna does not react.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{each of the guards would choose a certain number of women. hanna schmitz chose differently.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{in what way differently?}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{she had favourites. girls, mostly young. we all remarked on it, she gave them food and places to sleep. in the evening, she asked them to join her. we all thought well, you can imagine what we thought.}
<A>__{hanna stares back, impassive. michael watches.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{then we found out she was making these women read aloud to her. they were reading to her. at first we thought this guard, this guard is more sensitive, she's more human, she's kinder. often she chose the weak, the sick, she picked them out, she seemed to be protecting them almost. but then she dispatched them. is that kinder?}
<A>__{hanna looks back, not apologizing.}
<L>__{interior lobby. town hall. day}
<A>__{michael sits alone, head in hands, in despair.}
<L>__{interior courtroom. day}
<A>__{now rose is testifying. the court is quiet, focused.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{i want to move on now to the march. as i understand it, you and your daughter were marched for many months.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{yes. it was the winter of 1944. our camp was closed down, we were told we had to move on. but the plan kept changing every day. women were dying all around us in the snow. half of us died on the march. my daughter says in the book, less a death march, more a death gallop.}
<A>__{michael looks along the row to where ilana is now sitting.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{please tell us about the night in the church.}
<A>__{michael watches as rose looks across to ilana. ilana stares back at her. michael watches the exchange as rose nods, as if accepting she must go ahead and speak.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{that night we actually thought we were lucky because we had a roof over our heads. we'd arrived in a village, as always, the guards took the best quarters, they took the priest's house. but they let us sleep in a church. there was a bombing raid. in the middle of the night. at first we could only hear the fire, it was in the steeple. then we could see burning beams, and they began to crash to the floor. everyone rushed, rushed to the doors. but the doors had been locked on the outside.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{the church burned down? nobody came to open the doors? is that right?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{nobody.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{even though you were all burning to death?}
<A>__{rose nods.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{how many people were killed?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{everyone was killed.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{how did you survive?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{i needed to get away from the other women. because they were panicking, they were screaming. i couldn't stand it. i couldn't stand their screaming. i was more frightened of the other women than i was of the fire. so i too my daughter and led her to the upper floor. i can't defend what i did. it's impossible to defend. i took ilana in my arms and i led her towards the fire. there was a small gallery at the side of the church on the upper level. it saved our lives. the gallery didn't burn.}
<A>__{rose turns, in tears, to look at ilana.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{thank you. i want to thank you for coming to this country today to testify.}
<L>__{interior lecture room. law school. day}
<A>__{the group is back in the big hall. but the atmosphere is grim. it's a while before dieter speaks.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{i don't know. i don't know what we're doing any more.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{don't you?}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{you keep telling us to think like lawyers, but there's something disgusting about this.}
<A>__{rohl is very still, like an analyst who is finally leading his patient to the heart of things.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{how so?}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{this didn't happen to the germans. it happened to the jews.}
<A>__{everyone is shocked at his violent passion.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{what are we trying to do?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{we're trying to understand.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{six women locked three hundred jews in a church, and let them burn. what is there to understand? tell me, i'm asking : what is there to understand?}
<A>__{michael can't answer. dieter gets up, outraged now.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{i started out believing in this trial, i thought it was great, now i think it's just a diversion.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{yes? diversion from what?}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{you choose six women, you put them on trial, you say `they were the evil ones, they were the guilty ones'. brilliant!}
<C>__{dieter }
<D>__{because one of the victims happened to write a book! that's why they're on trial and nobody else. do you know how many camps there were in europe?}
<A>__{dieter turns, furious.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{people go on about how much did everyone know? `who knew?' `what did they know?' that isn't the question. the question is `how could you let it happen?' and better `why didn't you kill yourself when you found out?'}
<A>__{one of the group walks out.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{thousands! that's how many. there were thousands of camps. everyone knew.}
<A>__{dieter's passion is so great that everyone is shaken.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{look at that woman...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{which woman?}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{the woman you're always staring at. i'm sorry but you are.}
<A>__{michael is white. the atmosphere is electric.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i don't know which woman you mean.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{you know what i'd do? put the gun in my hand, i'd shoot her myself.}

<L>__{interior struthof camp. day}
<A>__{inside one of the huts, michael is by himself staring at a line of empty beds. he moves on, overwhelmed, lost. he passes through the showers. then he comes to a room with vast metal cages on either side. in the cages, the countless dusty shoes of the exterminated.}

<A>__{michael opens a door and walks into a room with a line of gas ovens. he walks past them. then he stands beside them, his head down.}

<C>__{judge}

<A>__{he waits. hanna doesn't reply.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{why did you not unlock the doors?}
<A>__{the judge turns to the row of defendants.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{i've asked all of you and i'm getting no answer. two of the victims are in this court. they deserve an answer.}
<A>__{ilana and rose are not far away from michael and the students. the judge puts down a bound handwritten document.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{here, this is the ss report. you all have copies.}
<A>__{there is a flurry of paperwork among the defendants and lawyers as they turn to their copies.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{this is the report which was written, approved and signed by all of you immediately after the event. in the written report, you all claim you didn't even know about the fire until after it happened. but that isn't true, is it?}
<A>__{the judge waits.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{well? it isn't true.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{i don't know what you're asking.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{the first thing i'm asking is, why didn't you unlock the doors?}
<A>__{hanna takes a look to the other defendants. for the first time her poise is crumbling.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{obviously. for the obvious reason. we couldn't.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{why? why couldn't you?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{we were guards. our job was to guard the prisoners. we couldn't just let them escape.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{i see. and if they escaped, then you'd be blamed, you'd be charged, you might even be executed?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{well then?}
<A>__{the judge waits.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{if we opened the doors, then there would have been chaos. how could we have restored order?}
<C>__{hanna }
<D>__{it happened so fast. it was snowing. the bombs there were flames all over the village. then the screaming began. it got worse and worse. and if they'd all come rushing out, we couldn't just let them escape. we couldn't. we were responsible for them.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{so you did know what was happening? you did know? you made a choice. you let them die rather than risk letting them escape.}
<A>__{hanna can't answer she has no answer.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{the other defendants have made an allegation against you. have you heard this allegation?}
<A>__{hanna does not reply.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{they say you were in charge.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{it isn't true. i was just one of the guards.}
<A>__{the other defendants interrupt to call out `she was in charge'.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{did you write the report?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{no. no. we all discussed what to say. we all wrote it together.}
<C>__{beckhart}
<D>__{she wrote it! she wrote the report. she was in charge.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{is that true?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{no. and i didn't write the report. does it matter who did?}
<A>__{rita beckhart has called out from her place. the judge looks at hanna a moment.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{i need to see a sample of your handwriting.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{my handwriting?}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{yes. i need to establish who wrote the report.}
<A>__{at once hanna's counsel rises.}
<C>__{hanna's counsel}
<D>__{i'm sorry, but i really don't see how that's appropriate. nearly twenty years have gone by.}

<D>__{somebody take her this piece of paper.}
<C>__{hanna's counsel}
<D>__{are you really going to compare handwriting of twenty years ago, with handwriting of today?}

<D>__{give her the paper. counsel, approach the bench.}

<C>__{hanna}

<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{what information?}
<A>__{michael stubs out his cigarette.}
<C>__{rohl}

<C>__{michael}
<D>__{ms mather?}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{yes. you're michael berg. i was expecting you.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{so you must tell me: what exactly brings you to the united states?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i was already here. i was at a conference in boston.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{you're a lawyer?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{i was intrigued by your letter but i can't say i wholly understood it. you attended the trial?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{yes. almost twenty years ago. i was a law student. i remember you, i remember your mother very clearly.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{my mother died in israel a good many years ago.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{michael hesitates for a moment.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{go on, please.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{perhaps you heard. hanna schmitz recently died. she killed herself.}
<A>__{ilana shakes her head.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{she was a friend of yours?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{a kind of friend. it's as simple as this. hanna was illiterate for the greater part of her life.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{is that an explanation of her behaviour?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{or an excuse?}
<A>__{michael shakes his head.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{no. no. she taught herself to read when she was in prison. i sent her tapes. she'd always liked being read to.}
<A>__{ilana shifts slightly.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{why don't you start by being honest with me? at least start that way. what was the nature of your friendship?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{when i was young i had an affair with hanna.}
<A>__{ilana looks at him for a moment.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{i'm not sure i can help you, mr. berg. or rather, even if i could i'm not willing to.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i was almost sixteen when i took up with her. the affair only lasted a summer. but.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{but what?}
<A>__{michael just looks at her.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{i see. and did hanna schmitz acknowledge the effect she'd had on your life?}
<A>__{michael stares back, understood for the first time.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{she'd done much worse to other people. i've never told anyone.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{people ask all the time what i learned in the camps. but the camps weren't therapy. what do you think these places were? universities? we didn't go there to learn. one becomes very clear about these things.}
<A>__{ilana looks at him, unrelenting.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{what are you asking for? forgiveness for her? or do you just want to feel better yourself? my advice, go to the theatre, if you want catharsis. please. go to literature. don't go to the camps. nothing comes out of the camps. nothing.}
<A>__{ilana looks at him, unrelenting.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{what she wanted...what she wanted was to leave you her money. i have with me.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{to do what?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{as you think fit.}
<A>__{michael reaches for his briefcase. he takes out the lavender tea tin, which he sets down on the table in front of ilana.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{ilana lifts the tin.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{when i was a little girl, i had a tea tin for my treasures. not quite like this. it had cyrillic lettering. i took it with me to the camp, but it got stolen.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{what was in it?}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{oh. sentimental things. a piece of hair from our dog. some tickets to operas my father had taken me to. it wasn't stolen for its contents. it was the tin itself which was valuable, what you could do with it.}
<A>__{she sits a moment, overcome, her hand on the tin.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{there's nothing i can do with this money. if i give it to anything associated with the extermination of the jews, then to me it will seem like absolution and that is something i'm neither willing nor in a position to grant.}
<A>__{michael nods slightly.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i was thinking maybe an organization to encourage literacy.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{there's a silence.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{good.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{do you know if there's a jewish organization?}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{i will be surprised if there isn't. there's a jewish organisation for everything. not that illiteracy is a very jewish problem.}
<A>__{there is the shadow of a smile.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{why don't you find out? send them the money.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{shall i do it in hanna's name?}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{as you think fit.}
<A>__{ilana smiles slightly. she puts her hand on top of the tin.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{i will keep the tin.}
<L>__{interior ilana's house. day}
<A>__{ilana is standing at the window watching down to the street where michael is walking away. she has the tin in her hand. when he's vanished, she turns and goes into her bedroom. there on the dressing table, there is a framed photo of ilana with her mother in germany before the war. she sets the tin down beside the photo.}
<L>__{int & exterior car. day 1995. michael is driving julia in the big mercedes through}
<A>__{the german countryside. he is tense, silent. julia takes a sideways look at him, but he does not respond.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{where are we going?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i thought you liked surprises.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{i do. i do like surprises.}
<L>__{exterior country. day}
<A>__{they draw up at a church. it is the same one he and hanna passed on their bicycles years before. michael and julia get out and walk towards the graveyard at the side.}
<L>__{exterior cemetery. day}
<A>__{michael & julia stand at a deserted grave side. the whole cemetery is seen. michael stoops down and uncovers a simple stone : hanna schmitz 1923 1988. julia watching, says her name.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{hanna schmitz.}
<A>__{julia waits a moment.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{who was she?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{that's what i wanted to tell you. that's why we're here.}
<A>__{julia looks, waiting. michael looks for a moment as if he will not go on.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{so tell me.}
<A>__{there is a moment, then they turn to stroll, michael talking, starting to tell the story.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i was 15, i was coming home from school, i was ill...}
<A>__{they walk away among the trees.}
