<A>__{as vince comes out of his house, carrying a sleeping bag, pillow, some clothing, a six pack of soft drinks. on top of the stack is a map of the western u.s., which he's studying while singing the song "houston":}
<C>__{vince}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{'going back to houston, houston, houston...'}
<A>__{vince tosses the items into the back seat of the caddy, just as julius jogs up the driveway and collapses against the caddie door. he's red in the face, completely drenched with sweat, gasping for breath, having run all the way from bel air.}
<C>__{vince}
<P>__{(startled)}
<D>__{jesus!}
<C>__{julius}
<P>__{(panting)}
<D>__{vince, the most amazing thing has happened.}
<C>__{vince}

<C>__{julius}
<D>__{i met one of our fathers. he told me of a man in new mexico who probably knows where momma is.}
<C>__{vince}
<P>__{(patronizing)}
<D>__{great.}
<A>__{julius, in his fervor, grips vince by the shoulders.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{she didn't abandon you she didn't even know you were born!}
<C>__{vince}
<P>__{(feigning concern)}
<D>__{awww that's terrible.}
<A>__{vince removes julius's hands, slides him away from the door, and opens it.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{and she was told that i died!}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{look, julius, i'm in kind of a hurry. sammy wants me to take the car to houston. much bigger bucks when you raffle for charity in houston.}
<A>__{julius takes the map from vince, looks at it.}
<C>__{julius}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{ new mexico is on the way to houston.}
<C>__{vince}
<P>__{(snatching back map)}
<D>__{a lot of places are on the way to houston. i will be back in a few days. stay in my apartment. run up my phone bill. throw wild parties. take advantage of me.}
<A>__{vince gets in behind the wheel. julius marches around the car and gets into the passenger seat beside him.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{vincent, we have to go see this man traven in new mexico!}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{no we don't.}
<A>__{julius slams his hand down on the top of the dash.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{yes we do! and i'm coming with you!}
<A>__{vince, realizing that julius won't be denied, tries a new tack.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{you know you're right. this is fate destiny but there's no way i'm gonna drive for 1500 miles with you smelling like that }
<C>__{julius}
<P>__{(calming down)}
<D>__{you're right i will take a shower be right back }
<A>__{julius leaps out of the car and bounds into vince's apartment. as soon as the door shuts behind him, vince hits the caddy's ignition and begins squealing out of the driveway in reverse... just as linda and marnie's car pulls into it, blocking his path. vince slams his hands down onto the wheel in frustration. linda and marnie get out of their car, singing "happy birthday." linda approaches vince with a birthday cake, complete with lit candles.}
<C>__{vince}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{why does everybody have to like me so much?}
<A>__{vince gets out of the car and, although it kills him, tries to put on a happy face for linda.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{happy birthday, vince.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{oh please it's not my birthday anymore }
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{happy birthday, vince. is julius around?}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{he's inside.}
<A>__{marnie walks into the house. linda gazes at vince's belongings in the caddy.}
<C>__{linda}
<P>__{(crestfallen)}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{nowhere }
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{you were going somewhere you weren't even going to say goodbye }
<A>__{vince, knowing when he's beat, whispers conspiratorially.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{okay, okay look, you can't tell anybody this not even your sister but i'm onto something so huge it gives me a rash just thinking about it.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{i got something in here }
<P>__{(pats the trunk)}
<D>__{ i don't even know what it is that's worth a fortune!}
<C>__{linda}
<P>__{(shrieks)}
<D>__{a fortune! that's great!}
<A>__{an apartment door opens, revealing a female neighbor of vince's.}
<C>__{neighbor}
<D>__{never sleep with that man. never loan him money. and never believe a word he tells you that's free advice.}
<A>__{she slams the door shut.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{vince...?}
<C>__{vince}
<P>__{(as if innocent)}
<D>__{i borrowed a cup of sugar from her once...}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{i'm coming with you. i'm not letting you out of my sight.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{no you're not.}

<P>__{(a hand over her}
<D>__{mouth; he's beaten and he}
<P>__{knows it)}
<D>__{okay, okay. just don't let on to julius. he thinks we're going to look up our ancestors, like in 'roots' or something.}
