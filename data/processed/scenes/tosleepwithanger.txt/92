<L>__{interior kitchen night}
<A>__{marsh and harry are getting quite loud in their argument. it has become a kind of controlled anger.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i think if anybody had a hand in killing hocker, you ought to ask or you should have asked emory and chick.}
<C>__{marsh}
<D>__{chick was outright killed by a mob. he killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{those boys never did have good luck.}
<C>__{marsh}
<D>__{you damn right they didn't, especially emory, my cousin.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{emory had made a lot of enemies. he had a big mouth.}
<A>__{m.c. and okra come in wanting to take pictures. marsh is pretty mad about them intruding. m.c. sets the naked lamp in front of marsh, on the floor, almost between his legs. before okra can get his camera set to shoot, marsh leaves. harry smiles as if he had won a major victory. herman flops down in the empty chair and starts to cough. suddenly suzie and gideon burst into the kitchen holding up one of the twins, loviray. they carry the twin towards herman's seat. herman is slow to react. herman gets up very slow. finally, they are able to seat the twin.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{what's the problem here?}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{she has a fish bone caught in her throat. could all of you go in the other room? gideon, get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil.}
<A>__{the twin is holding her throat and panting like a fish out of water. she is in a lot of pain. william, the twin brother, is standing at the door with a tragic face.}
