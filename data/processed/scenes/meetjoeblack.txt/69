<A>__{a low slung but well appointed room with a writing table, a working fireplace, expensive and appropriate hudson valley prints. parrish enters, clicks on the speakerphone, observes the party activity through a wide, bow window.}

<D>__{eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, i promise you, it's hope less, it's over. come on up, let's get drunk, if i had your shoulder to lean on i might actually enjoy this }
<C>__{sloane }
<P>__{(speakerphone)}
<D>__{no, i'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by monday, the waters could recede.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{if you're trying to show me lay down in front of the bus loyalty, forget it.}
<C>__{sloane }
<P>__{(speakerphone)}
<D>__{sorry, bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish. talk to you monday. okay?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{okay, eddie anyway, thanks for the memory.}
<A>__{parrish clicks off the speakerphone, turns around and looks out the window again, the party preparations in full swing, colored lights are tested, they flicker on and off.}
