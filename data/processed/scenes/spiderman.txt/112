<A>__{extending waldo over waldo, ock climbs the elevator housing chasing the rising car inside.}
<L>__{exterior construction roof night}
<A>__{the car arrives and liz jumps out. she's on nothing but a narrow girder! she tightropes on the girder. ock gets to the top. he looks across at her. she's stuck between two unfastened girders, at a dead end. he slowly telescopes a waldo toward her. she's got no place to run, no place to hide. he grabs her by the blouse and lifts her off the}
<B>__{girder.}
<P>__{spider man (v.o.)}
<D>__{put her down, ock.}
<A>__{ock looks across the street. there, on the top of a tall building, is spider man.}
<D>__{spider man i know what's happening to you, ock. i've been through a lot of changes myself lately. you have to listen to me.}
<C>__{ock}
<P>__{(holding liz)}
<D>__{who the hell are you? spider man spider man.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(seeing spidey)}
<D>__{spider man...}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{that's a lot of crap, clown... i am spider man, not you.}
<P>__{(points to liz)}
<D>__{ask you girlfriend.}
<P>__{(to liz)}
<D>__{tell him! spider man i'm a good friend of peter parker's ock. just like that girl you're holding. now let her go.}
<A>__{ock thinks for a moment, then he begins to extend the kicking and screaming liz out over the street, ten stories up.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{let her go? what an excellent idea. if you do not deliver your friend, mr. spider man, yes. yes, of course, i will let her go.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{put me down, you mechanical mutant!}
<A>__{liz is having none of this. she kicks, she fights. she twists. she flails around, making things a little worse. the ground is yawning death beneath her. rriipp! part of her blouse tears away and liz plummets! spider man swoops down on a web strand in his characteristic compound curve. he reaches out for the falling liz and misses her cleanly. the web is too short.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(falling away)}
<D>__{you jerk!}
<A>__{he thwips her with a second web and together they swing to a high girder where he deposits her safe and sound.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(straightening herself)}
<D>__{tell your friend peter next time i will get the taxi myself...}
<C>__{ock}
<P>__{(screams)}
<D>__{hey... you jerk... you phony spider man... prepare to meet your death, bug.}
<A>__{spidey thwips a beam and swings across toward ock.}
<D>__{spider man}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{actually, i'm rather fond of living... especially now...}
<P>__{(he looks at liz)}
<A>__{he lands on ock's girder and the two progeny of the cyclotron face off for the first time, ten stories above the street.}
<D>__{spider man}
<P>__{(a last appeal to reason)}
<D>__{octavius. just stop and think.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{i am thinking, insect. i'm thinking about exterminating you! spider man okay, if that's the way you want it... let's see what those chrome knuckles can do, doc...}
<A>__{a waldo lances out and catches spidey flush on the jaw. it knocks him to another girder. spidey hangs on and rolls over. he rubs his jaw.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{great...}
<A>__{spidey gets ready to go into action and gets pummeled by another barrage of blows from above.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{now i must kill you, you cretinous clown.}
<A>__{ock throws a roundhouse waldo that nearly knocks spidey off the girder. he's just barely hanging on. but spider man's not done yet. he thwips a high beam and swings into a better attack position. the two super adversaries engage in battle. with ock swinging from his waldos like a metal monkey and spidey swinging from his webs like, well, like spidey, they clang and bang through the girders of the}
<B>__{construction site.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{once i dispose of you, spider man, no one will be able to stop me. spider man stop you from what...?}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{my destiny!}
<A>__{ock throws his biggest punch yet. sirens can now be heard in the street. spidey avoids waldo strike after waldo strike. ock eludes web after web. but spidey's agility soon has him turning circles.}
<D>__{spider man over here, octopus!}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{that's professor octopus to you spider jerk! spider man give it up, professor. you'll never catch me!}
<A>__{ock takes three steps and soars through the air.}
