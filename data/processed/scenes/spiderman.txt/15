<L>__{interior control room day}
<A>__{peter enters wide eyed behind weiner. this place is a far cry from the experiment in the lab room. it's a fantastic netherworld to which no undergrad gains entrance. no one but peter. ock is sitting in a swivel chair with his back to peter. he has the look of captain nemo in his nautilus. this is ock's domain.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{hello, professor octavius.}
<P>__{(no response)}
<D>__{i really admired your experiment.}
<C>__{ock}
<P>__{(back to peter)}
<D>__{we have a lot of interests in common, peter. perhaps we should put our heads together, if you know what i mean...}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(flattered)}
<D>__{that would be... great.}
<C>__{ock}
<P>__{(turns with a smile)}
<D>__{now you take the planetary conjunction. this saturday night we will witness saturn, jupiter, the moon, the earth, the sun... all in a row. never seen within the memory of man, or measured for its effect. the total gravitational force must be quite exceptional. isn't that the subject of your paper...?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yes sir, i've worked out a new way to calculate the combined gravitational effect.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{i'm a busy man, mr. parker. but i think i could find the time to go over it with you. make sure it all... checks out.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{well... i'm sort of working with professor rosomorf and he suggested we kind of keep it between us. he thinks that my theory is... well, i don't know...}
<C>__{ock}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{the scoundrel...}
<P>__{(turns angry)}
<D>__{i want to see that data, peter!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{but professor octavius... if i knew you were interested... sorry, i've already given it to... professor rosomorf, and he is after all the head of our physics department... and i couldn't...}
<A>__{ock turns sweet again. he smiles too broadly.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{well, i'm certain something can be worked out. run along, young man.}
<A>__{peter begins to leave.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{just a minute... how about if i show you my discoveries... something i never showed to any other student... as a matter of fact to anybody at all.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{well i am really flattered, i mean i'd love to... but i...}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{very well shall we say if you come here tonight...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{but professor i don't now if i should...}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{make it eight sharp... i will be waiting for you... right here...}
<A>__{peter looks worried then leaves. ock turns to weiner who slouches against the wall smiling.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{the same academic world that's so keen to embrace that boy's undergraduate work, ridicules my anti force theory as quackery. i ask you, weiner... what is our society coming to? ha!}
<C>__{weiner}
<D>__{they are all a bunch of brainless assholes, that's what i say...}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{weiner! go get me that boy's data!}
<C>__{weiner}
<D>__{cost you fifty bucks.}
<C>__{ock}
<P>__{(weiner hissing)}
<D>__{just get it. we'll negotiate your fee when you have the data, alright weiner?}
