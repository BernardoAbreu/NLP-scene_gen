<D>__{and then i lost him. in the fog.}
<C>__{chief nyback}
<D>__{about how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?}
<A>__{will, hesitates.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{twenty, thirty seconds. i followed the sound down to the water. that's where...}
<A>__{he blinks. looks down. swallows.}
<C>__{will }
<D>__{that's where i found hap.}
<A>__{nyback sighs, shakes his head. reaches down to his bottom drawer and pulls out a bottle of bourbon and a glass.}
<C>__{chief nyback}
<D>__{i think you need a glass of this.}
<A>__{he goes to unscrew the bottle, but will shakes his head. stands. paces. rakes his hand through his hair. turns suddenly and swipes his arm across nyback's desk. everything crashes to the floor.}
<C>__{will}
<P>__{(yells)}
<D>__{why didn't i know about that goddamn tunnel, charlie?}
<A>__{nyback looks up at him. calm.}
<C>__{chief nyback}
<D>__{there's a bunch of those tunnels out there, will. from bunkers over sixty years old. i don't even know half of them myself, and i grew up here.}
<A>__{will clenches his fists.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i had him, charlie. right in front of me. not two feet. i could smell the son of a bitch. playing with me. and i missed the shot. he was right there and i missed the shot! then my goddamned gun jammed...}
<A>__{nyback gets up. limps over to his old friend.}
<C>__{chief nyback}
<D>__{will, you can't blame yourself.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i had him!}
<C>__{chief nyback}
<D>__{it's only gonna make you crazy.}
<A>__{just then there's a soft knock on the door. the men look over. ellie sticks her head in. speaks in a tone that belies that a man has recently died.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{you wanted to see me?}
<A>__{will turns his back to her. nyback heads over.}
<C>__{chief nyback}
<D>__{right, ellie.}
<A>__{ellie flicks a look at the pile on the floor. at will's back.}
<C>__{chief nyback }
<D>__{i want you to take care of the investigation into detective eckhart's shooting.}
<A>__{ellie looks at him. confused. lowers her voice.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{but what about the connell case? i'm on the connell case.}
<A>__{nyback puts a hand on her shoulder.}
<C>__{chief nyback}
<D>__{we need paperwork, ellie. you know that. just write up a quick report.}
<A>__{ellie's shoulders droop. thought she was playing with the big boys. just then will turns abruptly and grabs his coat.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i'm going to check on the roadblocks...}
<A>__{nyback catches his arm.}
<C>__{chief nyback}
<D>__{you're no good right now, will. go back to the lodge. try to get some rest.}
