<L>__{interior concert hall night}
<A>__{sterling comes through the door and his face falls. he's stepped into a loud metal concert. we see a go go dancer in latex. onstage is rammstein, a bizarre german industrial metal band. the tattooed young crowd slam dances and swings glo stix over their heads. some wear rubber brain skullcaps outfitted with fiber optic lights. it's a sea of spiked hair and bondage}
<B>__{outfits.}
<A>__{sterling squares his jaw and starts pushing through the crowd. with his tuxedo he sticks out like a penguin in a chicken coop. on the balcony above the crowd stands a wild haired young gangster with pierced brows. with him is a street tough girl with multi colored hair. they look like a post apocalyptic bonnie & clyde. they are yorgi and petra. yorgi checks his watch. his delivery is late. then his cell phone rings. he's getting the news from outside. he looks down, spots sterling amidst the moshing crowd. with that look, that tux, there's no mistaking what he is. they make eye contact and sterling gives a little nod. yorgi calmly issues orders into his phone. immediately viktor starts moving in sterling's direction. viktor is huge, with a mohawk and a six inch goatee. sterling sees him advancing and makes for the exit, pushing through the freaky crowd.}
