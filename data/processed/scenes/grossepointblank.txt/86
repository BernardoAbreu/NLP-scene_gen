<L>__{interior gym later}
<A>__{debi and martin are seated at a round table with six others in an area blocked off for dinner. plates of gumbo are arriving and the wine is poured. darius, an african american, is in mid conversation with amy, who looks like she walked out of a laura ashley catalog and sits on the other side of martin. dennis and mike are two suits in the midst of a non stop sports conversation.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{...you gotta hold the fans responsible, though, dennis, because they're the ones putting up with the mediocre product.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{i guess, though, you know, if you look at it mike, that park is a beautiful park, i've gone to that park many times i've had the greatest time of my life at that ballpark and let's face it, i tell you this, mike, by the sixth inning, if you're having the fun you should be having at tigers stadium, you don't even know what the hell's going on anyway...}
<A>__{they both crack up at this. angle on darius, martin, & debi}
<C>__{darius}
<D>__{have you two been together since high school?}
<C>__{debi}
<D>__{no }
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{ yes. actually we just bought that little frank lloyd wright on pine avenue... debi's a social worker and i mow down insurance claims at aetna }
<C>__{debi}
<D>__{we haven't seen each other since high school.}
<C>__{darius}
<D>__{i figured. you two look too happy together. i shouldn't say that though, i'm married... so, martin what are you up to these days? what do you do for a living?}
<A>__{debi perks up; this should be interesting.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i'm in pro active international relations. it's a very specialized company. we execute economic investment opportunities. sort of economic clean up... with an emphasis on personnel. it's boring, you know, it's boring. i don't like to talk about it because i don't think what a man does necessarily reflects who he is...}
<A>__{martin begins to draw strange looks from all over the table. martin may be in trouble.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{...i've always tried to refrain from a black and white moral lexicon you know, good, bad, right, wrong i've been more interested in the gray areas.}
<A>__{silence. martin pushes on.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{but that's no way to live. i guess you've got to just take the leap of faith. believe in something. fuck it.}
<C>__{darius}
<D>__{sounds complicated, martin. are you happy?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i just have to close this one last account. i'd like to just stop now, today, but i can't... it's a step in the right direction.}
<C>__{debi}
<D>__{i don't know, martin. it sounds like you're feeling compromised. live the way you want. the only thing that's inexcusable, to me, is cynicism. that's the biggest cop out there is.}
<A>__{nods of assent come from around the table. a brief silence, and then...}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{but wait. i still don't understand what you do.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i work at kentucky fried chicken.}
<A>__{debi suppresses a laugh.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{you do not.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{yes i do.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{you don't...}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{in the corporate offices.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{oh... really?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{what do you do?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i sell biscuits to the southland.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{you do not.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{it's what i do.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{you're so funny...}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i sell biscuits and gravy all over the southland }
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{ stop it }
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{you know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? i move all of those }
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{ no.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{sometimes we sell them to mcdonald's and just change them to special barbecue sauce.}
<A>__{across the table from martin and debi, dennis turns to darius.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{what do you think about black coaching in the nfl, darius? because i think it's great.}
<C>__{darius}
<D>__{i don't pay much attention to football.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i have to agree with you dennis. it's good to see that the owners are willing to put the franchise behind a black head coach or qb when for years in the league they've been kept out of the thinking positions and relegated mainly to the physical game.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{but now, you see, you have warren moon at the helm, cunningham, art shell, and the coach up at minnesota...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{dennis green. and if you remember, doug williams was the first black man to prove that on a superbowl sunday.}
<A>__{amy leans in to martin.}
<C>__{amy}
<P>__{(to martin)}
<D>__{i'm teaching art at cedar junior high school.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{...yeah, listen. where do you stand on this whole louis farrakhan issue...?}
<C>__{darius}
<P>__{(facetious)}
<D>__{i'm a de klerk man myself.}
<A>__{debi nods, indicating to the deejay stand.}
<C>__{debi}
<D>__{i'm going over to play some tunes.}
<A>__{martin watches her walk away.}
