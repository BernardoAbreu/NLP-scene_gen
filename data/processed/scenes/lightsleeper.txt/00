<A>__{john letour, forty, light sleeper. never meant to be a drug dealer, it just came along. he's been other things: messenger boy, cab driver, model, postal clerk, doorman, nightclub shill never meant to be them either. now he's a d.d. drug dealer. john letour, well groomed, khaki slacks, leather jacket, tippet like scarf, belt pouch, "beatle" boots, a shadow drifting in and out of other shadows, new york, day, night: watching, listening, rarely speaking nonexistent, seen only by those he sees. his face an affable blank. make of it what you will. the eyes flicker; the hands shift discreetly. a map of calculation. once he had a drug problem. life turned a page. today he follows instructions: he sleeps light one eye open, anticipating. john letour, d.d., loner, voyeur, has been drifting toward an unknown destination. at mid life the destination draws near. the circle tightens. the dealer is anxious. the destination is love.}
<B>__{night in the life}
<A>__{credit sequence: new york by night. john letour nestles in back of a blue car service sedan, face reflected in the window. neon mixes with steam, street people with tourists, young dates: each with a different agenda, a hidden purpose. his beeper goes off. he clicks it, checks the digital message. the driver stops at an uptown corner. letour opens the curbside door, motions to the driver he'll be back in "ten" minutes. he enters the video laundromat, a twenty four hour video rental laundromat tanning salon. inside, he meets a retro yuppie (j. crew division) in the "classics" section. they exit. on the sidewalk, money is exchanged for a packet. letour pockets the uncounted cash. the yuppie mouths goodbye, eager to put distance between him and letour. john checks his beeper, stops at a pay phone, dials. john letour re enters the sedan; the driver heads downtown. high rises give way to tudor city. uncollected trash lines the curbs. letour eyes a pedestrian; pedestrian looks back. later. three a.m. the streets are dark. letour's car passes a glowing korean market. letour narrates from diary:}

<D>__{labor day weekend. some time for a sanitation strike. everybody crazy to stock up. they decide to score at the last minute and want it now. never fails. the faces look alike. you gotta use memory tricks: each has some peculiarity it keeps you sharp. a d.d. told me when a drug dealer starts writing a diary it's time to quit. i started writing after that. not every night now and then. just to burn off the night. fill up one book, throw it out, start another.}
