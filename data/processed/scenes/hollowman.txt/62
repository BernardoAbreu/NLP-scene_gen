<L>__{interior research lab day}
<A>__{sebastian, wearing surgical scrubs sits in an examination chair. wire leads sprout from the electrodes covering his head and arms. the electrodes seem to outline his body.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{so, how was your first night?}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{restless. hard to sleep when you can't close your eyes.}
<A>__{as sebastian talks, we can see the electrodes around his jaw pump up and down.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{yeah? what'd you do?}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{got up a couple of times. knocked about.}

<D>__{yeah, sarah mentioned you weren't in your cubicle. she said she called you over the intercom and you didn't respond.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i guess i didn't hear. i had the radio on.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{it'd be helpful to us if you'd tell whoever's on duty where you're going to. i mean, if something were to happen, we'd want to know where to find you.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i didn't think it was a problem.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{it isn't. i just don't want it to become one.}
<A>__{machines pump out eeg, ekg readouts. matt studies them.}
<C>__{matt }
