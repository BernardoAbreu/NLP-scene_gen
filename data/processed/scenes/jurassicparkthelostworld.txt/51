<L>__{exterior ridge night}
<A>__{night has fallen over the island. the hunters have established base camp in an area they have trampled and cleared just below the ridge. blue laser fences encircle the perimeter. inside, half a dozen tents are set up around a central campfire. the vehicles are all parked at one end, away from the tents. at the other end, there is a row of at least a dozen "capture containers," cages that hold the imprisoned dinosaurs they have already rounded up. sarah, malcolm, and nick stand at the edge of the ridge above, looking down at the scene. sarah stands a bit further back from the others, not wanting to get too close to the edge. voices waft up to them, raucous, laughing, some even singing. dr. juttson has a pair of night vision binoculars trained on the cages.}
<C>__{juttson}
<D>__{carinthosaurus compsognathus triceratops pachycephalosaurus or small scavengers only.}
<A>__{malcolm, also with binoculars, furrows his brow, seeing something below. through malcolm's binoculars, he sees peter ludlow, standing in the middle of the camp, pointing, giving orders. on the ridge, malcolm drops the binoculars.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{ludlow. that's why hammond was in such a hurry for me to get here. he knew they were coming.}
<A>__{he gives the binoculars to sarah, who moves forward gingerly.}
<C>__{malcolm }
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{heights, i can't help it. put your arm here, will you?}
<A>__{she puts his arm around her waits, to steady her while she is close to the cliff edge.}
<C>__{juttson}
<D>__{what do they want?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{they want their money back. to ingen, this island is nothing more than a bed investment.}
<C>__{juttson}
<D>__{we should get back to base camp. eddie's waiting for us.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i can't believe peter ludlow's running all this.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{he isn't. check out the guy walking past the fire.}
<A>__{she hands the binoculars to malcolm. through the binoculars, malcolm sees roland, who's walking with ajay, weapons and equipment slung over their shoulders.}
<C>__{sarah }
<D>__{i've seen him before. in brazil. he and that guy with him were spearhunting jaguars. said it was immoral to go after them any other way. he's not just a hunter, he's a philosopher. kind of guy who beats you up with your own argument.}
<A>__{back on the ridge,}
<C>__{sarah }
<D>__{he's the one in charge.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{well, if that's true the man in charge just left camp.}
<A>__{nick, who has been quietly fuming next to them, now steps forward.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{then this is our chance.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{our chance to do what?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i don't know these guys, but i know 'em. i've seen 'em on japanese whalers, french barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the north atlantic. they're all the same. they spray us with water cannon when we try to stop 'em, sink our boats, and then call us crazy.}
<A>__{he rummages through his pack, coming up with various tools. a hunting knife. a bolt cutter.}
<C>__{nick }
<D>__{nobody has to come with me. i've done this before.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{why, nick. you are a tree hugger.}
<A>__{he looks at her, hurt.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{there' no reason for name calling.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{dr. juttson, please take kelly back to camp right away. leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{what are you guys gonna do?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(signs)}
<D>__{exactly what john hammond wanted us to do.}
