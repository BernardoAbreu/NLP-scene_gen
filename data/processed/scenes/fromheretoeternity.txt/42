<L>__{interior kitchen day}
<B>__{close shot swirling dishwater in sink medium shot prew}
<A>__{bent over the sink, scraping, washing and rinsing cooking pans and mixing basins. he hangs the soap bucket on the hot faucet and turns it on full force. as he does, private willard, a fat, whining cook, dumps an additional huge pile of pans before him. prew looks at them ruefully. willard says something to him with a "hustle up" gesture. the faucet drowns the words.}
<B>__{medium shot another part of kitchen prew at sink in b.g.}
<A>__{men are working in the steady, helpless motion of the kp. waiters swing in and out of the entrances leading to the mess halls, carrying large trays.}
<B>__{medium close shot sergeant stark}
<A>__{the mesa sergeant, a tall, gaunt man, surveys the scene possessively. maggio, dining room orderly today, wearing a soiled white coat, flashes by to the mess hall, almost dropping his loaded tray in his haste.}
<B>__{medium shot private treadwell}
<A>__{a slow, lazy, heavy man, peeling potatoes. there is a large kettle filled with dirty water in front of him in which the potatoes are floating. treadwell stabs at one with a long fork, misses it. he stabs again, almost in slow motion, misses again. he sees stark glowering over him.}
<C>__{treadwell}
<D>__{ah+m suppose to be a automatic rifle man, not a spud cutter.}
<C>__{stark}
<P>__{(disgustedly)}
<D>__{rifle man, huh? all somebody'd have to do would be holler war at you and it'd be over the hill and far away.}
<A>__{stark walks off.}
<C>__{treadwell}
<D>__{... they just give me my chance they'll see...}
<A>__{he is surprised and pleased as he spears a potato this time. he raises it triumphantly like a caught fish.}
<B>__{medium shot prew and willard}
<A>__{the faucet is still on and we cannot hear what willard says as he dumps more pans before prew. however, he is obviously complaining that prew is slow. prew, sweating and angry, barks something back at him and turns the faucet off.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{no cook ever used that many panel not even for an officers, banquet, ladies invited! want me to grow couple more arms?!}
<A>__{stark, always alert to trouble, comes into shot. willard sees him and speaks with whining dignity, for stark's benefit.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{all i ask is that you keep the pans washed up so they're clean when i need them. in order that i am allowed to cook the kind of food required for men who work hard all day and who need good nourishing food to get their nourishment.}
<C>__{stark}
<D>__{hole up 'at noise. this man's hot as a forty five shootin downhill.}
<C>__{willard}
<P>__{(terribly injured)}
<D>__{how you think i can do my job if the mess sergeant takes sides with a goldbricking kp? what do you think i am?}
<C>__{stark}
<D>__{i think you're a fat cook who can't cook.}
<A>__{as willard retires, maggio pours through from the mass hall. screaming joyously, he shoves two empty platters in front of him.}
<C>__{maggio}
<D>__{comin through! comin through! me and my table waiters!}
<C>__{maggio}
<D>__{we workin our tail off. they runnin us to death. hot stuff! comin through hot stuff one side!}
<A>__{nobody pays any attention but prew, who smiles at him. maggio winks back.}
<C>__{maggio}
<D>__{hello, prew! bettern being threwn in jail, ain't it?}
<A>__{maggio passes camera, leaving the shot and disclosing warden, who has entered from the mess hall in his wake. he carries a dish of eggs and sausage and is leaning against a pastry table. he is grinning lovingly toward prew. he strolls over to prew. he eats through following. the smile never leaves his face, broadens as the scene progresses.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{you look awful tard, kid.}
<B>__{close shot prew}
<A>__{working over the sink.}
<C>__{warden's voice}
<D>__{how do you like straight duty?. life in a rifle compny, eh?}
<A>__{prew stops working, turns toward warden.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{what makes you think i mind it?}
<A>__{medium shot featuring kp's, stark, maggio, willard, treadwell as something electric transmits itself and they all stop what they are doing to look over toward prew and warden.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{i didn't say you minded it, kid. i just said you looked tard. drawn to a fine edge.}
<C>__{prew}
<P>__{(smiles back)}
<D>__{i don't mind it, top. it's a great life, this. i find a pearl, i will cut you in. fifty fifty, if you hadn't put me here, i wouldn't have had no chance to find it.}

<D>__{well, well, there's a man for you. i will see if i can fix you up with a lot more since you like it so much. how you like the garbage detail?}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{thanks, top, i've had it. you give it to me tuesday. remember?}
<C>__{warden}
<P>__{(nods, as if just remembering)}
<D>__{well, then, how 'bout street cleaning detail?}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{that, too. yesterday.}
<C>__{warden}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{you got a better memory than me. guess the best thing to do is leave you right in the kitchen a while, huh?}
<A>__{he pretends to turn away, then stops, turns back.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{course if you was an ath a leet you wouldn't have to pull kp. or any fatigue duty for that matter...}
<C>__{prew}
<P>__{(not smiling now)}
<D>__{if you think you can push me into fightin, warden, you're wrong. not you and dynamite and the treatment. i'm twice the man you are. if you dint have them stripes i'd take you out on the green and beat you to a pulp.}
<C>__{warden}
<P>__{(smile growing bigger)}
<D>__{don't let the stripes worry you, kid. i can always take my shirt off. take it off right now.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{you'd like that. you could get me a year in the stockade for that one, couldn't you?}
<A>__{close shot prew's hand closing around a heavy mug in the sink.}
<B>__{medium close shot prew and warden}
<A>__{warden looking at prew's hand. warden's grin broadens with something more than sarcasm. he is 'impressed and pleased by prew's honest anger.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{don't throw it, prewitt. it might break on my head. and that would cost you one thin dime next payday.}
<A>__{warden deliberately turns his back and walks off. prew looks after him. camera moves in to feature his hand on the mug. he grasps it tighter, then lets it fall back into the soapy water,}
