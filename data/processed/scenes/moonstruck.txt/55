<L>__{exterior. east river night}
<A>__{the moon and nothing else. then a cigar is thrown into it and sends it shimmering. it was the moon reflected in water. now the camera pulls back and we see the old man and the five dogs are standing on a ruined pier. the moon gleams up from the hudson river. the old man speaks to the dogs.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{alright now. howl. howl.}
<A>__{the dogs do not howl. so the old man, by way of demonstration, howls at the moon. he looks to the dogs to follow suit. they do nothing. he howls at the moon again. the dogs do nothing. the camera continues to pull back until we can see the whole pier, with the old man and the dogs on it, and the moon above them. the old man, frustrated now, cries out.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{how long must i wait? quanto tempo devo aspettare!}
<A>__{the dogs start to howl. the old man, pleased as the mad hatter he is, laughs and laughs.}
