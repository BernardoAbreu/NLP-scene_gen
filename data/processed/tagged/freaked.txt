<C>__{rick}
<D>__{can you imagine it, regis, kathie lee? one day i'm a hot young movie star, and the next day i'm a hideous mutant freak, covered with festering lesions.}
<A>__{oddly, regis and kathie lee are also in complete silhouette.}
<C>__{regis}
<D>__{sounds like my wife when she misses a mudpack!}
<A>__{the audience cracks up. kathie lee pooh poohs regis.}
<C>__{kathie lee}
<D>__{oh regis! you're incorrigible! ha ha!}
<P>__{(to rick, she turns earnest)}
<D>__{ricky, once you were the all american boy next door, star of the beloved hey dude films. now the very mention of your name makes children scream in terror. we've all read about your disturbing story. but the people want to hear it from you, ricky coogan.}
<P>__{(sfx: children scream)}
<D>__{won't you tell us your story?}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{well, it's kinda long, but okay. it all started when i signed a deal to be spokesman for the e.e.s. conglomerate...}

<B>__{guide.}
<A>__{further off, at the boardroom table, four doddering old corporate farts on the brink of death look on with glazed expressions.}
<C>__{rick}
<P>__{(through a clenched smile)}
<D>__{so, what kind of crap do you scumbags want me to peddle?}
<C>__{hertz}
<D>__{everything. everything except shoes, of course. hah hah...}
<A>__{he laughs pathetically. rick doesn't respond. hertz nods to a nearby executive who hands him some beef sticks.}
<C>__{hertz}
<D>__{meaty twig beef sticks.}
<A>__{rick takes them and holds them up to the camera. smiles. flash.}
<C>__{hertz}
<D>__{helmet head hair spray.}
<A>__{he takes the hair spray and holds it up. smile. flash. the assistant carefully hands hertz a pulsating metal container with lots of warnings and danger symbols on it. hertz gives it to rick.}
<C>__{hertz}
<D>__{noxon 24 biogenetic neuro fertilizer.}
<A>__{rick holds it up, then pushes it away in disgust.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{fertilizer? ricky coogan does not do ads for hi tech cow shit. i'm a star, got it, hertz?}
<P>__{(to his aide)}
<D>__{rico, give these misguided clowns tony danza's phone number, and let's get the hell out of here.}
<A>__{he gives the finger to the ees photographer, who obligingly takes a picture. hertz waves at him to get lost, and calls after rick who's headed to the door with his entourage.}
<C>__{hertz}
<D>__{rick. wait! only you can stand up to the radicals trying to keep noxon from the struggling farmers whose very future depends on it.}
<C>__{rick}
<P>__{(hesitates)}
<D>__{noxon? wasn't that just banned?}
<C>__{hertz}
<D>__{only in the u.s....and europe.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{but i heard that shit's lethal.}
<A>__{hertz lets out a big laugh. he shakes his head at rick.}
<C>__{hertz}
<D>__{rick, rick, rick... you want proof? fine. just take a seat. please.}
<A>__{rick nods to his entourage. they sit at the boardroom table, across from the ees execs. an easel behind hertz shows a placard with a bar graph. hertz whispers something to an aide, who scurries off.}
<C>__{hertz}
<P>__{(to rick)}
<D>__{meet the head of our south american research facility, juan valdez.}
<A>__{the aide ushers in a handsome latin american executive in a natty three piece suit and a sombrero.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{my name is george ramirez.}
<C>__{hertz}
<D>__{whatever. he's worked with noxon 24 every day for five years, and he's in fine shape. aren't you, juan?}
<A>__{george glares at hertz bitterly. hertz stares him down.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{yes. i am fine. me and my team in santa flan have }
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{santa "flan?" what kind of shitty name for a country is that?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{it is named for the patron saint of creamy desserts... as i was saying, we've worked very closely with noxon...}
<A>__{rick nods. we cut back to george, but he isn't george anymore. he has mutated into a similar looking actor, in the same suit, the same sombrero, but shorter and swarthier.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{i personally supervised its development...}
<A>__{rick furrows his brow. he's a little suspicious of george's transformation, but just a little. now george is even shorter, even swarthier. yet another actor.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{i performed rigorous scientific tests. no potential danger was left uninvestigated...}
<A>__{rick's suspicion is increasing. he looks over to hertz, who feigns total innocence. george is now even shorter. still another actor. his clothes are baggy, and the sombrero is starting to slide down over his face.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{the environmentalists are crackpots, all of them.}
<A>__{rick looks at his entourage. their mouths hang open in astonishment. george has now shrunk to near midget proportions. the sombrero completely covers his head. when he takes it off, we see he's now played by linda hunt!}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{it's ridiculous, i tell you. totally ridiculous!}
<A>__{rick is ready to ask questions, but hertz cuts him off.}
<C>__{hertz}
<D>__{thank you, valdez. that will be all.}
<A>__{george nods and heads back to his seat. as he passes behind hertz, he can't resist sticking his thumbs in his ears and making a face.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{wait a second }
<C>__{hertz}
<D>__{ricky, this is important. we're talking about a major threat to the ees image. how does 2 million dollars plus expenses sound?}
<A>__{the aide reveals a new placard on the easel. it reads "$2 million."}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{look, it sounds great, but }
<C>__{hertz}
<D>__{i hear you. make it five million }
<P>__{(a new placard: 5 million)}
<D>__{that is, if the board agrees ...}
<A>__{hertz reaches beside his chair and pulls a lever. the old geezers beside him raise their arms stiffly, as if they were being pulled by strands of fishing line, which they are.}
<C>__{hertz}
<D>__{good, it's unanimous. well, what do you say, ricky? are you ees's "man in santa flan?"}
<A>__{rick looks at his advisors they look over at linda hunt, then emphatically shake their heads "no." rick looks at hertz, who shows him five big fingers and grins. rick breaks into a big smile and gives hertz his trademark thumbs up sign.}

<L>__{interior l.a. airport security check}
<A>__{rick stands in line at the luggage x ray machine. he impatiently checks his watch as the x ray checker chats him up. a crazed anarchist holding a large bomb passes through the security check unquestioned.}
<D>__{x ray checker my kids just loved you in "hey dude three: the final countdown." we need more wholesome role models like you.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{where the fuck is ernie?}
<A>__{we hear women's screams. they turn towards the noise and see a bunch of stewardesses scattering from a trendy young cad with a fake hand sticking out of his fly. this is ernie, rick's buddy and resident court jester.}

<D>__{mister coogan, is this your bag?}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{yeah, why? x ray checker is this your kid?}
<A>__{he indicates the x ray monitor, where we see the skeleton outline of a bucktoothed, bespectacled 10 year old kid curled up in rick's bag. the kid waves. rick and ernie look at each other in horror.}
<D>__{rick ernie stuey gluck!}
<A>__{the bag bursts open, and out pops stuey gluck, an obsessive young autograph hound toting a stack of scrapbooks and memorabilia.}

<D>__{rick! rick! look! i got a rare still from your high school production of the glass menagerie! could you sign it for me? please?!}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{no!}
<P>__{(to ernie)}
<D>__{let's get the hell out of here!}
<A>__{ernie nods and yanks the bag away from under stuey. they run away down the corridor. stuey chases them, holding up an 8 by 10 photo.}

<A>__{rick and ernie run around a corner with stuey in pursuit.}
<C>__{stuey}
<D>__{rick! remember the speech you gave at the actors forum for social justice!?}
<A>__{he holds up a cassette player and hits play. it's rick's old speech.}
<C>__{rick's voice }
<D>__{if all the world is a stage, then let us shine the spotlight on truth, integrity, and a deep compassion for all life.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{leave me alone, troll!}
<P>__{(to ernie)}
<D>__{that was before i got an entertainment lawyer.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{quick, down here.}
<A>__{ernie leads rick down an adjacent hallway.}
<B>__{in the hallway}
<A>__{it's a dead end. rick and ernie are trapped. ernie gives rick a sheepish look. stuey stands at the entrance of the hallway. he holds up a time magazine.}
<C>__{stuey}
<D>__{rick! rick! it says here noxon's dangerous. why are you lending your name to it? what's happened to you, rick? you used to be good! and now... i just don't know...}
<A>__{stuey starts to cry. rick looks guilty.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{don't cry, stuey, i'm still good.}

<D>__{in the bag.}
<A>__{the plane hits turbulence, and rick's drink flies up out of his glass he catches it as it comes down. another stewardess helps the anarchist put his bomb in the overhead compartment. ernie ogles her. she sneers at him. we hear the captain's voice on the loudspeaker.}

<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. to the right of the aircraft, you can see a great view of the grand canyon.}

"free nelson mandela" we widen to reveal the subheading: "inside specially marked boxes." we keep widening to reveal that this is not on a protest placard, but a box of cereal some guy is eating as he watches the protest.}

<P>__{(he spots the limo)}

<A>__{off to the side, away from the protesters, an unmarked limo with tinted windows (and plates that say not ees) awaits. kevin, an ees exec, leans out the window and waves discreetly at ricky. the stewardesses, looking tipsy, wave their bras out the back window invitingly. ernie tries to grab ricky by the arm, but he resists. he's looking at the protesters.}

<D>__{well, with this skuggs based noxon technology, it's not only possible, it's just the beginning! of course, what happened to our expensive spokesman ricky coogan was an unfortunate coincidence, but profits from these new markets could total in the billions.}
