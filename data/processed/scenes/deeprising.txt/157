<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior passageway night}
<A>__{trillian comes running down the passageway to a freight elevator. looking over her shoulder, she hits the button. the elevator doors open to a freight elevator large enough to hold a dozen people. trillian rushes in and hits the up button. she breathes a sigh of relief as the steel doors close...until the elevator starts going down.}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{up!! i want to go up!}
<A>__{she panics. and starts pushing the up button frantically, her heart pounding in her chest. there is not a sound except for the hum of the elevator descending...until something drops on the roof with a thump! trillian screams. the elevator comes to a bumps stop.}
<C>__{trillian }
<D>__{no...no...}
<A>__{trillian shrinks from the ceiling of the elevator...and then the car starts to move again.}
<C>__{trillian }
<D>__{go up...please go up!}
<A>__{trillian pounds on ever button on the console, to no avail. the car continues its inexorable descent. finally, in desperation, she hits the emergency stop button. the elevator stops. the emergency siren whines. a long beat. nothing moves...and then... wham! something beats on the roof, trying to break in. and again wham! the elevator shudders and continues its descent. trillian backs up against the wall, staring at the ceiling, scared. the elevator dings! startled, trillian screams. the doors start to open. panicked, trillian raises the only weapon at her disposal...a high heel. the doors open. something lunges in! trillian swings her high heel...right into pantucci's face! finnegan plows in right behind him.}
<C>__{pantucci}
<D>__{owww!! oowww!!!}
<A>__{trillian tries to run out. finnegan grabs her.}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{i'm not staying here!}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{it ain't any better out there!}
<A>__{trillian struggles. finnegan does not let go of her.}
<C>__{finnegan }
<D>__{lady, i'm telling you...}
<A>__{trillian buries her high heel into the back of finnegan's hand, breaking his grip.}
<C>__{finnegan }
<D>__{oww!}
<A>__{just then, the doors to the elevator shut, and the car starts to ascend.}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{now look what you did!}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{i saved your life is what i did!}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{who asked you to!}
<C>__{pantucci}
<D>__{what the hell's going on here?}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{you're with that other bunch, right?}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{what other bunch?}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{the thieves.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{i'm not a thief.}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{then who are you?}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{i'm their ride.}
<A>__{trillian hears music to her ears.}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{you have a boat?}
<A>__{her demeanor changes, her voice goes to honey.}
<C>__{pantucci}
<D>__{finnegan!}
<A>__{trillian and finnegan turn to pantucci who is looking down at the floor where a mass of yellow slime has dripped from the ceiling. all look up to the yellow goo dripping from the ceiling...followed by a sucking sound.}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{it's up there!!}
<A>__{finnegan lifts his pulse rifle and blasts the ceiling. the sucking sound stops.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{not anymore.}
<A>__{the elevator stops. ding! the door opens. finnegan whirls his rifle, rising. trillian lifts her high heel, ready to strike... hanover, chin, and mamooli have their massive guns trained on the car. the captain and canton quiver behind them. there is a momentary stand off.}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{where are my men?}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{dead.}
<C>__{chin}
<D>__{yaahhh!!}
<A>__{chin charges finnegan, the butt of his rifle raised to smash finnegan's skull. finnegan parries and drives chin into the rear wall of the elevator. mamooli jumps finnegan from behind, wrapping his rifle against finnegan's throat. pantucci jumps on mamooli's massive back, ripping at his face. finnegan drops, buries his elbow in mamooli's solar plexus, spins, and has his knife out of his boot and at mamooli's throat in a flash. angle on: trillian. impressed. she had no idea.}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{drop it!}
<A>__{finnegan looks up into the barrel of hanover's gun...and a pair of eyes that will use it. finnegan does as he is told.}
<C>__{hanover }
<D>__{now, back up!}
<A>__{again, finnegan does as he is told.}
<C>__{hanover }
<D>__{everybody in!}
<A>__{the captain and canton are only to happy to comply. as they slip in, trillian tries to slip out. hanover swings his gun on her.}
<C>__{hanover }
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{trillian}
<P>__{(freezing)}
<D>__{nowhere...}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{hanover, listen...}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{shut up!}
<A>__{hanover hit the elevator button. the elevator starts to rise.}
<C>__{hanover }
<D>__{now, where's mulligan? where's vivo?}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{i told you...}
<C>__{pantucci}
<D>__{man, there's something here! on the boat!}
<C>__{canton}
<D>__{you see? you see?}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{shut up! shut up all of you! now here's what we're doing... mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, chin and i are staying here to finish the job...}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{did you clear this?}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{with who?}
<A>__{all of a sudden, the car is jerked to a halt, as if some giant hand was yanking on the cable.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{with that...}
<A>__{and then, the elevator jerks down again. and up. everyone is thrown about like straw. everyone is shouting, panicked. and then the jerking stops...and the sound of sucking surrounds the car. the cable starts twisting, creaking sickeningly above their heads.}
<C>__{pantucci}
<D>__{it's gonna snap the cable!}
<A>__{trillian starts hitting the buttons frantically.}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{open! open! god damn it!!}
<A>__{finnegan is at the doors, pulling them with all his might.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{help me!!}
<A>__{pantucci, then mamooli, then hanover and chin pull at the doors as trillian keeps hitting the buttons. the doors part a bit.}
<C>__{finnegan }
<D>__{they're coming! they're coming!}
<A>__{the doors fly open to...a solid wall.}
<C>__{finnegan }
<D>__{oh shit...}
<A>__{and silence...until the doors slam shut...the cable snaps...and the car plummets! screaming and shouting mixes with the bloodcurdling shrieking of the metal elevator frame against the shaft. finnegan's eyes go to the floor indicator. 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4! an automated voice rapidly calls out right along with it }
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{4th floor. 3rd floor. 2nd floor. 1st floor...}
<A>__{down, down, down it goes. faster and faster. but the elevator doesn't stop at the first floor. it keeps dropping. the floor indicator blinks: "sublevel. sublevel. sublevel."}
<C>__{canton}
<D>__{it's taking us to the bottom of the ship!}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{hang on!}
<A>__{cables snap. metal screams. the elevator starts to buckle. which is actually good, because it's getting jammed sideways in the shaft which slows it down. the it hits bottom with a resounding crash.}
