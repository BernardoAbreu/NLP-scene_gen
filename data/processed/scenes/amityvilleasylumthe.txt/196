<A>__{lisa pulls the door shut and falls to the floor of the dark interior. lisa faces the door, bracing herself with the knife held upwards. everything is quiet. suddenly the door shakes as patient x thumps on it. the door cracks as patient x smashes against it. lisa crouches down with the knife at the ready. the gun blows a hole right through the door. patient x leans through the hole, peering down at lisa crouched on the floor. he aims the gun through the hole and prepares to fire. lisa brandishes the knife and thrusts it forward with all her might. the blade rips through patient x's right eye. he screams and drops the gun in the cupboard before stumbling backwards into the staff room. patient x clasps his hands to his eye which is now gushing with blood. lisa grabs the gun and stands up. patient x looks at her with his remaining eye. lisa aims the rifle through the hole in the door.}

<A>__{bang! the shot gun blasts a hole through patient x's chest, blood splatters over lisa. suddenly a white light fills the room and allison defeo materialises. she is dressed in a clean white dress, her angelic complexion bears no wounds. allison takes the hand of patient x's corpse. the white light swarms over patient x's body and he rises to his feet. his head is now intact and he is dressed in a white robe. he looks at allison and they share a peaceful smile. allison walks with patient x through a doorway filled with a blinding white light. they disappear and the light slowly dissipates.}
