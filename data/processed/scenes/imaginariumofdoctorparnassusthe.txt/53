<A>__{who looks puzzled.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{that's even worse than the other ideas you've had today.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{you're not wrong... ah, percy, what would i do without you?}
<C>__{percy}

<L>__{ext outside pub night}
<A>__{the theatre, parked outside a pub, is up and running. anton, as mercury, is doing his pitch.}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{sleep no more. procrastinate no longer. embrace this once in a life time opportunity. let the mind of doctor parnassus be the portal to the infinite world of your imagination.}
<A>__{behind the curtain, percy is signalling valentina to see if doctor parnassus has been drinking. she sniffs him.}
<C>__{doctor parnassus}
<D>__{what are you doing? please concentrate. we've got a tremendous amount of work to do tonight. a great deal depends on it.}
<A>__{a roll on the drums from percy. the curtain rises. doctor parnassus `floats' above the stage on his glass plinth.}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{as old as the universe itself, the great doctor, versed in every mystic practice known to man, and many more besides, will guide you to your destiny.}
<A>__{however, the audience a few passers by and drinkers who have drifted out of the pub for a smoke aren't much interested in anton. instead they pay more attention to the masked tony who, decked out in a stylish costume, is working the sparse crowd with his smooth charm. anton, irritated, glances back at doctor parnassus who is worried about the lack of customers. tony is now surrounded by fascinated women. they laugh at one of his jokes. one pretty young woman, sally, in particular seems to be smitten by the handsome `actor'. tony smiles seductively at her. the sight provokes anton. he leaps off the stage, grabs sally by the wrist and begins to pull her to the stage. percy keeps playing.}
<C>__{sally}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{what?... hey, what you doing?}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{t taking you to the heart of your imagination!}

<D>__{now you're talking!}
<A>__{a few onlookers cheer.}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{n not at the same time!}
<A>__{anton is still pulling sally onto the stage.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i'm not going on my own.}
<C>__{anton}

<C>__{anton}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{no. t two c competing imaginations in the imaginarium at the same time... it's n not advisable.}
<C>__{female friend}
<D>__{eh?}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{the stronger imagination will overcome the weaker and then there's n no knowing what might happen.}
<C>__{female friend}
<D>__{that's really stupid.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{let go!}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{d don't be afraid, d dear lady. you'll be safe with me.}

<A>__{valentina, worried, steps forward to try and restrain anton.}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{anton...}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{it's alright! it's alright!}
<A>__{staggering under the weight of the struggling sally, anton barges into doctor parnassus' on his glass plinth. the plinth rocks and teeters. valentina tries to stop it falling. anton, unaware of what he's done, disappears through the mirror as doctor parnassus crashes head first onto the stage. crack! from behind the mirror comes the sound of a woman's terrifying, terrified screams.}
<C>__{female friend}
<D>__{sally! they've got her in there! that's her screaming! sal! they doing something to her! sally! help, somebody! help! save her!}
