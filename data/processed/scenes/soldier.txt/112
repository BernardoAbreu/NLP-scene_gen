<L>__{interior dining commons evening}
<A>__{jabbering voices, the click of utensils. heaping plates of food are being passed the length of long tables set up in communal style. johnny is kicking ellen under the table, will flips a piece of food at tommy when his mother, ilona, isn't looking, and the outspoken slade is lecturing a pioneer named chester.}
<C>__{slade}
<D>__{you can't talk to a soldier no more than you can talk to a...a...bomb! or a bullet! they're trained, they're killing machines. they got an objective and they go after that objective and nothing stops them but killing them.}
<C>__{chester}
<P>__{(a glance over his shoulder)}
<D>__{just one? to kill us all?}
<A>__{the conversation gets the attention of johnny and will who stop food fighting to listen to the adults talk.}
<C>__{slade}
<D>__{first off, if there's one, there's more. that's how it is, soldiers travel in bunches. second, they don't waste soldiers on folks like us, that's for police! training soldiers to kill weaklings like us is not what they call "cost effective."}
<C>__{chester}
<D>__{then who do they fight?}
<C>__{slade}
<D>__{other soldiers! there's a saying, "soldiers deserve soldiers."}
<A>__{angle on ilona noticing will and tommy listening.}
<C>__{ilona}
<D>__{slade, hush up.}
<A>__{angle on tommy and will glancing toward the next table. angle on the next table where todd, wedged between sandra and mace, is eating like a machine, looking neither right nor left as people jabber all around him. angle on judith whispering to emma at a nearby table as she watches todd eat.}
<C>__{judith}
<D>__{you see how much he's eating?}
<A>__{angle on slade who turns now and boldly addresses todd across the gap between the tables...}
<C>__{slade}
<D>__{i don't see how you can not remember how you got here, sergeant.}
<A>__{there's a sudden hush in the noisy room, broken only by a few urgent whispers and a cough. todd looks up from his food and meets slade's look. sandra scowls at slade as slade persists...}
<C>__{slade}
<D>__{you're not a deserter, are you... sergeant?}
<A>__{the silence is even more charged than before. sandra looks alarmed. someone coughs. the tension is unbearable.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<A>__{a sigh of relief from everybody! but slade presses on.}
<C>__{slade}
<D>__{then how come you're not with your unit?}
<C>__{jimmy pig}
<D>__{oh, come on, slade, let the man eat.}
<C>__{slade}
<D>__{it's not an unreasonable question.}
<P>__{(to todd)}
<D>__{how about it, sergeant?}
<A>__{on todd, actually struggling with the question... remembering. suddenly he blurts...}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i was...replaced.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{replaced?}
<A>__{todd hesitates for half a second before answering.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{by a better soldier, sir.}
<A>__{there are looks exchanged among the pioneers as we...}
