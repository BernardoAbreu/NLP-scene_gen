<L>__{exterior training field, camp shelby, mississippi day}
<A>__{the squad of nisei recruits, one hundred young asian faces, surround sgt. maples. he paces before them, holding up a wooden staff, looking in their eyes...}
<C>__{maples}
<D>__{anyone.}
<A>__{and kabup steps forward. bows slightly. then salutes...}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{sir!}
<A>__{maples stares. hard.}
<C>__{maples}
<D>__{you don't salute me, you don't call me 'sir', soldier, i'm an enlisted man.}
<A>__{kabuo stares back. blank.}
<C>__{maples}
<D>__{and nobody bows in this man's army, you're in america, son. not japan.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{i'm sorry, sir, force of habit.}
<C>__{maples}
<D>__{no more 'sir'. that's the last of that.}
<A>__{tosses kabuo a wooden staff and a helmet. a little hard. as kabuo slips the helmet on...}
<C>__{maples}
<D>__{the exercise is avoiding thrusts. now, first y...}
<C>__{kabuo }
<D>__{ready, sergeant.}
<A>__{cut off in mid word, maples glares back. are you? thrusts sharply, but kabuo moves just enough to slip the blow by no more than an inch. their eyes lock. suddenly, maples unleashes... ...a savage series of thrusts at blinding speed, and kabuo... ...slips them all effortlessly, scarcely seeming to move. as a man might toy with a child. maples studies the face for any trace of mockery. and sees nothing at all. stabs out, only to have kabuo... ...slash maples' staff from his grasp, with a move so quick as to be nearly invisible. maples clearly stunned by the display.}
<C>__{kabuo }
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{he bends, picks up maples' staff, hands it to him. and bows. slightly. the sergeant is hot. he looks into the faces of this nisei regiment, searching for a single smirk. there is none.}
<C>__{maples}
<D>__{are you ready for some simulated combat, soldier?}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{for combat. sergeant.}
<A>__{and maples lunges with surprising speed, to be swept off his feet in a blur, lying flat on the earth, his head pinned to the ground by the tip of kabuo's staff. a hush. kabuo withdraws his staff. retrieves maples'...}
<C>__{kabuo }
<D>__{your weapon, sergeant.}
<A>__{and bows.}
