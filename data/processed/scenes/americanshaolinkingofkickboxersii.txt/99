<T>__{dissolve to:}
<B>__{angle on disciples}
<A>__{who are now slow dancing to a romantic melody some holding the girls closer than others. drew and ashema are locked in an embrace, their eyes closed. a hand comes in and taps drew on the shoulder.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(eyes still closed)}
<D>__{not now, li...}
<A>__{the hand comes in again, punching drew in the shoulder hard. drew opens his eyes, and sees that he is surrounded by five tough guys, dressed in dark clothes and with sunglasses on.}

<C>__{tough}
<D>__{leave.}
<B>__{angle on disciples.}

<B>__{angle on drew}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{no, thanks.}
<A>__{he turns back to ashema, but she is pulled back by the giggle girls, away from danger. the tough spins drew around and pushes him hard. one of the toughs has already gotten behind him, on his knees, and drew goes flipping over the tough, landing hard on the ground, the wind knocked out of him. drew gets up, wincing, not really ready to fight.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{can't we talk this over?}
<A>__{the tough pulls his fist back to strike drew, who has been grabbed by two other toughs, his arms pinned behind his back. suddenly, a figure flies in and slams the tough to the ground. it is gao, and he immediately sets on the other toughs. the room erupts in a melee as the disciples go at it with the village toughs. the girls are screaming as the boys kick and punch. the disciples are winning, having a great time, until the door to the room slams open and the headmistress comes storming in, screaming at the top of her lungs for them to stop. angle on drew, gao and the disciples as they all agree as one to hightail out of there. they go running past the headmistress and out the door, full speed.}
