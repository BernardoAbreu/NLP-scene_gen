<L>__{interior studio. night.}
<A>__{...we are back in the studio, the gun fire morphing into rapturous applause.}
<D>__{talkback v o go, prem.}
<A>__{a wall of light and noise as the two walk on stage. cheering, music, banks of searing studio lights. on stage, jamal, an eighteen year old indian boy man stares, petrified. he would surely turn and run but for the iron grip on his shoulder of the smiling host, prem kumar.}
<C>__{prem}
<D>__{welcome to who wants to be a millionaire!}
<A>__{more applause.}
<C>__{prem }
<D>__{please give a warm welcome to our first contestant of the night a local from our very own mumbai!}
<A>__{under cover of the wild applause, prem ushers jamal towards the guest's chair, leaning in and hissing.}
<C>__{prem }
<D>__{smile, dammit.}
<A>__{the lights seem to bore into him but jamal manages a tentative smile. out of nowhere, a hand slaps him ferociously across the face. then again and again. blood trickles from his mouth.}
