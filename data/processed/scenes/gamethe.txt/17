<D>__{how are you , sky?}
<A>__{she has the concerned, forthright tone of a "recovery person," someone who's been through a lot of therapy and wants to reach out. schuyler grimaces, then mimics the tone:}

<D>__{i'm just fine. how are you?}
<C>__{elizabeth }

<D>__{mm, good luck, bye.}
<A>__{he punches off the phone in the middle of her "good bye." schuyler returns to his work, as if the call hadn't taken place but a few seconds later, we see his concentration is completely shattered, he leans back in his squeaking deskchair.}
