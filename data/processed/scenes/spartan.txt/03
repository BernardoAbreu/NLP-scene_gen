<L>__{interior training facility. day.}
<A>__{a large, hand painted sign hangs on the cinderblock wall of the rough building. it reads:}
<D>__{these are the precincts of pain. a goddess lives here. her name is victory.}
<A>__{in front of the sign walks the young woman we saw earlier. she is exhausted, she has a towel wrapped around her neck. camera takes her to scott, who is holding a cup of coffee, and making notes in the small notebook we saw earlier. she stands, waiting, as she finishes his note.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{well done.}
<C>__{young woman }
<D>__{a signal honor to work with you, sir.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{thank you, sergeant.}
<A>__{he starts away from her, and she raises her hand slightly, to indicate she has something more to say. he turns back to her.}
<C>__{jackie black}
<D>__{sir: day or night. black or white. you reach out for me. "black, jaqueline a. us 24191489."}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{i will remember, sergeant.}
<A>__{she nods, and walks off. scott walks toward a mess tent. he is joined by george blane, a very military looking figure of an older man. he wears an informal fatigue outfit, mismatched jacket and trousers, without insignia. scott is greeted by him, as they walk toward the mess tent. scott shows the notebook to blane, and blane refers from the notebook to what we see are a group of eighty young men, in the mess tent, two of them the men we saw on the hill. blane takes the notebook and walks off, as scott enters the mess tent. angle his pov, scott enters the tent. several of the young men react to him. he nods to them. among them, we see the young man scott berated on the hill, who rises and comes over to scott. angle, on scott, who sits, as a uniformed man brings him a tinfoil tray with some food on it. scott takes out a stiletto from his pocket, presses a button and the blade emerges. he begins to use it to cut up his meat. the young man from the hill, anton, stands sheepishly near scott, till scott turns, acknowledging him. anton takes a card out of his pocket, the size of a credit card, old, creased cardboard: it reads, "rogers rangers, rules for engagement. 1782". there is a line drawing of a man with a musket, and we read, on the card, beneath it, boldtype rules for fighting guerilla style. written on the card, in old faded ink, "sgt. anton, m. us. 3149584, united states special forces." the young man (anton) shows the card to scott.}
<C>__{scott}
<P>__{(of the card)}
<D>__{what's this then?}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{it was my father's, sir.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{he carry it over there?}
<A>__{as they speak, we see, in an insert, the printed rules "dated 1759". "rule 4: tell the truth about what you see and what you do there is an army depending on us for correct information. you can lie all you please when you tell other folks about the rangers, but don't never lie to a ranger or an officer".}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{he come back?}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{yes, sir. he did.}
<C>__{scott}
<P>__{(nods. pause)}
<D>__{well, so.}
<A>__{scott pauses again. as he looks at the young man, who is obviously unable to express his gratitude, and sense of occasion.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{you carry that card, son. it might save your life.}
<P>__{(anton nods)}
<D>__{...you could use it to light a fire, or something...}
<A>__{blane's aide calls the men to order.}
<C>__{blane's aide}
<D>__{the candidate cadre will fall in on the white line...}
<A>__{the men start to come to their feet, and leave the mess tent.}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{i just wanted to say, sir...that, to meet you...}
<C>__{scott}
<P>__{(rising, as he gives}
<D>__{the ranger card back}
<P>__{to anton)}
<D>__{you never met me. you've been up for a week. you're seeing snakes...}
<A>__{the exhausted men come to their feet, and into a line. they are happy, and joking with one another. in the bg we see those who failed the course, sitting apart, file onto a bus which has just pulled up. angle on a young man, who looks out of the window. angle his pov. twenty or so similarly exhausted men, with dufflebags, are being shuffled onto the bus. angle, on the young man, anton, as he exits the tent, who stands next to scott, outside the tent. scott stands next to an old, but pristine mustang cobra. he withdraws a small dufflebag from the front seat, and looks up to see anton standing next to him.}
<C>__{anton}
<P>__{(looking after the departing, failed men)}
<D>__{...i can't imagine how they live with it...}
<A>__{angle on scott. as he thinks a very brief moment, as if reluctant to become philosophical, and then turns back to anton.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{make sure you can't imagine it, cause, if you can, it's just one step to doing it.}
<A>__{anton shakes his head, sadly, at the spectacle of the failed men.}
<C>__{scott}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{...they'll be back where they came from by morning, and all this is just a bad dream.}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{my name is...}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{do i need to know?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{if i want camaraderie, i will join the masons.}
<P>__{(pause. then, summing it all up:)}
<D>__{there's just the mission.}
<A>__{beat. anton steps away.}
<C>__{blane's aide}
<P>__{(as he glances down at his clipboard)}
<D>__{congratulations on completion of this evolution. i know you would probably like some sleep, but i do not think you'd mind sparing ten minutes for induction.}
<A>__{the camera pans over the smiling faces of the eight very proud young men. angle on blane and scott, off to the side. beyond them, we see the bus holding the failed candidates, filling up.}
<C>__{blane}
<D>__{thank you, bobby.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{not at all, sir...}
<C>__{blane}
<D>__{...you going home?}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{...weather permitting, sir...}
<C>__{blane's aide}
<P>__{(in the distance. as}
<D>__{camera tracks with}
<P>__{blane and scott)}
<D>__{...as i call your names:}
<P>__{(he consults his clipboard)}
<D>__{grossler, anton...}
<A>__{these two men steps forward. angle, on anton, nodding to himself at the proudest moment of his life. angle, cu scott, looking at him. camera takes blane and scott into a cinderblock building which houses a shooting range. we see various housefronts, and storefronts, and targets. a long table along one wall holds a coffee urn. blane draws two cups of coffee. through the open door we see anton and grossler, smiling, entering the building. anton comes into the room, and smiles at scott. we see scott look away, sadly. he shares a look with blane, drains his coffee cup, crumples it, throws it away. blane gestures to scott, meaning, "shall we begin?" scott hesitates for a moment, and then nods.}
<B>__{focus.}
<A>__{angle, on scott, in the bg, as blane steps forward to address the two candidates.}
<C>__{blane}
<P>__{(over his shoulder, to an aide)}
<D>__{...would you bolt the door, please...?}
<A>__{scott gestures to the aide, "one moment".}
<C>__{blane}
<P>__{(to the candidates)}
<D>__{...are you tired, gentlemen?}
<P>__{(the two young men smile)}
<D>__{this is the completion of the evolution:}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{only one of you may join the unit. the first man through that door will be inducted.}
<A>__{he gestures at a far door in the room. angle, on scott, as he looks at the candidates, as they get the picture. beat.}
<C>__{scott}
<P>__{(to himself, quietly)}
<D>__{...yeah...you wanted to know the 'secret knowledge'...}
<A>__{cu scott as he looks, interrogating the two men, weighing them, as they look at each other. beat. grossler starts to advance on anton, in a fighting crouch. scott gestures to the aide that that was what he wanted to see. the aide lets scott out of the back door.}
