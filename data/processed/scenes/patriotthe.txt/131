<A>__{marion sits on the side of the river with susan who avoids looking at him. using the knife we've seen him use in battle he cuts slices off an apple and eats them.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{good apple.}
<A>__{no response.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{very good. sweet.}
<A>__{he cuts a slice and offers it to her. she doesn't take it. he puts the slice between them. after a long moment she picks it up but as she's about to eat it, she stops, seeing something on it. she puts it back. marion looks at the apple slice and sees a dark red splotch on it. he looks at his knife and realizes that it's dried blood. off balance, he turns to susan who stares straight ahead, a thousand miles from marion.}
