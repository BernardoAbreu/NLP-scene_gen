<A>__{she opens jeffrey's car looking in the front seat at the cup holders. she turns to leave and sees the backseat filled with two boxes and the books we saw him take...}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{uh, what are those boxes?}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{i'm going to the store. you need anything?}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{what do you need at the store?}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{soy sauce...}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{right now?}
<C>__{wigand}
<P>__{(meaning in the car)}
<D>__{that's my stuff from the office...}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{why did you take your stuff from the office?}
<C>__{wigand}
<P>__{(simply)}
<D>__{i didn't want to leave it there...}
<C>__{liane}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{wigand}
<P>__{(matter of fact)}
<D>__{i got fired this morning... where else am i gonna take it?}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{why? who said?}
<C>__{wigand}
<P>__{(specifically)}
<D>__{thomas sandefur...}
<C>__{liane}
<P>__{(stunned, fearful)}
<D>__{what are we supposed to do...? what about our medical coverage; what about our health? what about our car payments? the payments on this house?}
<A>__{he looks at her. there's an unspoken moment when it seems he's desperate for her to ask how he's feeling... but she doesn't and now there's a wall up and the moment passes...}
<C>__{wigand}
<P>__{(a beat, specific)}
<D>__{there's a severance agreement... it includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{sure you don't need anything?}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{no, thank you.}
<A>__{she's stunned. he leaves. and as liane's completely still, her accessories seeming literally to weigh her down, she wants to ask how he is, how he must be feeling, and she turns into camera towards him to do that. but he's driven off down the street.}
<C>__{liane }
<D>__{jeffrey...!}
