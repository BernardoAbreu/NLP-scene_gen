<D>__{are you smoking again?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{no, sweetie. why?}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{well you get jumpy when you smoke.}
<A>__{ben puts his arm around janine, and pulls her close.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i'm not smoking. so, why don't we worry about what color we're gonna paint this room, instead of worrying about things that aren't happening?}
