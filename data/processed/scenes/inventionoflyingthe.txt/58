<L>__{interior fancy restaurant night}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{he was a very unlucky man. he spent his last days behind bars. i never really knew him.}
<P>__{(sad moment; pause)}
<D>__{but i guess i've also had a little luck in my life. i did have a wonderful grandmother who raised me.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{oh, that's sweet.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yeah, she's great.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{where is she?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{old person's home obviously. who wants to live with that? gross.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i know, right?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{but i'm going to get her out of there tomorrow.}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{i'm going to buy her a big beautiful mansion where she can spend her few remaining days in luxury.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{that's nice.}
<A>__{the waiter arrives with their food.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{i don't know what's wrong with the chef today, but these just look awful.}
<A>__{he places them down.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{they look fine to me.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{well, you're stupid.}
<A>__{mark and jennifer begin eating. mark wants to say something and takes a moment to summon the courage.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{right. i was thinking that since i'm going to be rich and successful now that i might be in your league.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{and that maybe we could be together. romantically.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{what would be the point?}
<A>__{mark didn't expect this answer.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{well, i don't know, maybe we might enjoy it. maybe we'd be good together and could have a happy life, raise a family together.}
<A>__{jennifer thinks this over.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{well, i do like you. and i enjoy your company.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<D>__{and if we were to get together and procreate i would like the offspring that are carrying half my genetic code to be well taken care of and financially stable. i also think you'd make a good father and a good husband, which i like.}
<A>__{mark smiles. this is going well...}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{good. fantastic.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{unfortunately, none of that changes the fact that you'd still be contributing half of the genetic code to our children.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i don't want short, fat kids with little snub noses.}
<A>__{and that's the end of that. mark nods.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{mark takes a bite of his food. jennifer smiles and does the same, oblivious to mark's pain. mark's cell phone rings.}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{hello?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{mark's face melts in terror.}
<C>__{mark }
<P>__{(loudly)}
<D>__{what?}
