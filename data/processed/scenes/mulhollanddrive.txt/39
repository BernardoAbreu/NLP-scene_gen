<L>__{interior apartment living room}
<A>__{betty enters, thrilled with what she sees. the apartment is filled with movie memorabilia, deco furniture, oriental rugs, brass floor lamps and a massive tiled fireplace. she sets her bags down and stares.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{it's unbelievable!}
<C>__{coco}
<D>__{i told ya.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{wow!}
<C>__{coco}
<D>__{now i guess you and your aunt have an understanding. so here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.}
<P>__{(coco hands betty the key)}
<D>__{everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. if you want, later i will introduce you around. no hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. it's just up the stairs we passed. it's open to all the tenants. you can see the hollywood sign from there.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{oh coco thank you. thank you so much.}
<C>__{coco}
<D>__{you got it! see you later honey.}
<A>__{coco leaves and closes the door behind her. betty begins to explore the apartment. after walking a circle in the living room she passes through the kitchen. she moves down a hallway looking at paintings and posters. she goes into the bedroom. she smiles when she sees the bed which has a huge ornately carved head and foot board. she notices the soiled dress on the floor and she frowns as she looks closer. she stands back up, shrugs and goes into the bathroom which has all the original thirties fixtures damndest floor to ceiling tiles. as she goes toward the sink she smiles to herself in the mirror above it. suddenly something catches her eye and she opens the shower stall. there before her is the naked, beautiful dark haired woman.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{oh my!}
<A>__{she quickly closes the shower door.}

<D>__{dark haired woman there was an accident. i came here.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i understand. i saw the dress. i...i'm sorry. are you all right?}

<D>__{oh my god. i'm sorry. i will let you get back to that. i'm going to get unpacked.}
<A>__{betty goes to the bathroom door and is closing it when she stops and looks back in.}
<C>__{betty }
<D>__{what's your name?}
<A>__{we see a close up of the dark haired woman. we see her eyes widen with a kind of fear. she's frantically thinking searching her mind for an answer.}
<C>__{betty }
<D>__{i'm sorry. i will get out of here and we can talk later.}
