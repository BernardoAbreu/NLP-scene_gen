<A>__{watts enters a new chamber, looking around in astonishment. the domed ceiling is honeycombed with cells like a beehive. grotesque molluscoid organisms are secreted in them their vile orifices cinched tightly shut. watts stumbles on something: looking down, she sees a helmet. picks it up. the stenciled label reads holloway. the clear visor has been melted through by a powerful acid. she looks up: a tracheal airshaft curves up into the dark. an electric crackle. a flare of blue light makes watts leap back against the wall. holloway falls out of overhead shaft and crashes to the floor. he lies in pain, barely conscious. blue and luminous, a holographic ghost. watts stares, paralyzed. the ghost gasps out a word:}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{jocelyn!}
<A>__{holloway's headlamp shines on the molluscoid right overhead: the beam awakens the organism. its sphincter mouth dilates. a soft white octopoid facehugger descends on a quivering rope of mucus. sprawls slitheringly over his clear visor. acid hisses. smoke rises from the glass. the vision vanishes in a sizzle of static. watts huddles against the wall, gasping. in the beam of her flashlight, the facehugger lies dead, legs curled in. she looks up. sees the open molluscoid above where holloway lay. the other molluscoids not yet opened in their cells. terror. she steals out of the chamber.}
<C>__{lower corridor}
<A>__{watts emerges into a hallway. leans against the wall, wide eyed. panting with the horror of what she's seen. she glances left and right. jumpy now. all is silent. she lifts the map unit. a trace leads off into the dark. if holloway's course before was direct and clear, now it is a meandering thread. a drunkard's walk.}
