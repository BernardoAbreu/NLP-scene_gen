<A>__{charlie looks up at the opening of the door and arnold's entrance. the woman stands in the doorway. arnold moves quickly past charlie about halfway down the landing, white faced and trembling.}
<C>__{the woman}
<P>__{(getting a little shrill)}
<D>__{what's the matter? hey. hey, you. hey, you, what's the matter?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{let's go.}
<P>__{(to the woman)}
<D>__{what's the trouble?}

<D>__{i don't know. ask him. what's the matter? hey, you. you, what's the matter?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{go back inside.... all right, all right.}
<C>__{the woman}
<D>__{how about that, huh?}
<A>__{she turns angrily, goes back into her room (ad libbing as she crosses) and slams the door. charlie moves down the landing to arnold, who looks at him wide eyed, almost in terror.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what happened, arnold?}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{i don't know. i'm just scared.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yeah, i don't blame you, i'd be scared too like this. i don't know why we dragged you up here in the first place. it's a barbaric custom. come on.}
<A>__{he has taken arnold's arm and would lead him down the stairs, but arnold pauses again at the first step.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{don't tell eddie.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{no i won't, arnold.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{why don't we just sit here for ten minutes or so?}
<A>__{charlie frowns, then shrugs.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{all right, arnold.}
<A>__{they both sit slowly on the steps. arnold is still trembling from the whole terrifying experience.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{don't ever tell anybody.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it's nothing to be ashamed of.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{please, charlie.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i won't tell anybody.}
<A>__{a man's voice suddenly calls down from an upper floor.}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{anything wrong down there?}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(calling back)}
<D>__{no. no. nothing wrong.}
<A>__{charlie sits. camera moves up closer to both men. the whole experience has depressed charlie, and it shows on his face. camera pulls slowly back so that we get the small, sordid feeling of the two men, somewhat tight, sitting on a dirty ill lit staircase outside a whore's bedroom.}
