<A>__{twelve year old lila walks sadly through an art museum. she looks at various old portraits of men. she studies their facial hair. when she turns a corner, she is shocked to see a large renaissance painting of a naked woman entirely covered with fur. she hurries to it. she looks at the placard next to the painting. it is a painting of mary magdalene.}

<D>__{i remember once coming across a painting of mary magdalene entirely covered with fur. i guess that's where i got the idea that maybe the catholic church might be a place that encouraged excessive hair growth in its women.}
