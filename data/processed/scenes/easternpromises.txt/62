<L>__{exterior trans siberian restaurant. kitchen rear night}
<D>__{semyon emerges into the wine crates and beer bottles in the yard at the back of the restaurant where the doberman is straining at the leash, snarling and barking. an already anxious ozim is cowering in the shadows, held at bay by the dog. the moment semyon steps out the dog stops barking. ozim relaxes a little and steps forward. semyon pets the dog.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{so what did they say? semyon takes a swig of vodka. ozim looks severely nervous.}
<C>__{ozim}
<D>__{they were going to kill me. those chechens are savages. ozim is reliving the ordeal.}
<C>__{ozim }
<D>__{i pointed out that i am a muslim too and it is a sin for a muslim to kill a muslim.}
<C>__{semyon}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{what did they say about my son?}
<C>__{ozim}
<D>__{they said they would spare me only if i delivered kirill to them.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{you are being very honest.}
<C>__{ozim}
<D>__{i fear you more than i fear them. semyon suddenly breaks the neck of the bottle and holds the jagged edge to ozim's throat. the dog snarls at semyon's feet.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{never again do business with any member of my family behind my back.}
<C>__{ozim}
<D>__{never. i will never listen to kirill again. i swear... semyon tosses the bottle away. after a moment...}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{do they know where to find kirill?}
<C>__{ozim}
<D>__{they are like wolves.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{do they know what he looks like? ozim shakes his head.}
<C>__{ozim}
<D>__{no. they have just arrived from the mountains.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{then tell them you will deliver kirill to them. ozim is stunned. he stares at semyon as if he were insane.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{tell them to give you two days.}
