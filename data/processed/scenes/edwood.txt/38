<L>__{exterior street later that night}
<A>__{ed and bela run toward us, bela's cape flapping in the wind. ed takes a swig from bela's flask. they're a bit tipsy.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{are you sure this is okay?}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{don't worry. i do it every halloween.}
<L>__{exterior cemetery night}
<A>__{the moonlight shines down on a rickety old cemetery. the wind blows hauntingly, and tombstones gleam in the blackness. ed and bela reach the locked gates. they glance at each other, then start to climb over. ed helps bela. they jump down, and ed peers nervously.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{now what?}
<A>__{bela looks like a child on christmas morning. he takes another swig, then starts running giddily. he disappears into the cemetery.}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{i am dracula!}
<A>__{bela darts happily through the graves. his cape flies behind him.}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{i am the bat!!}
<A>__{ed's eyes light up. he starts chasing after bela. bela's heart is racing. he zig zags past ancient crypts. gargoyles peer down. the wind howls through the skeletal trees, silhouetted against the cloudy sky. ed runs through the shadows, trying to catch up. bela flaps his cape up and down. we almost think he's going to fly. ed races up, then quietly stops. he eagerly watches bela, practically expecting him to turn into a bat. it's a magical, crazed moment.}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{i am dracula! i will live forever!!!}
<A>__{bela laughs, then lies down on the grass.}
<B>__{wide}
<A>__{ed slowly walks over and lies next to bela. they're happy, eyes alert, on top of the world. ed peers in wonder at his new friend.}
