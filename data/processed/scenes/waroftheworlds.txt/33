<L>__{exterior beach dark}
<A>__{ray is heaving rachel up to shore. robbie is not far behind. they are all fighting to get their breath after swimming for so long. ray can no longer haul rachel up the beach.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{help me. help me with her.}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(gagging) okay.}
<A>__{robbie almost slips as he gags, still fighting for breath. pulling each other up the hill....}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{don't stop. don't stop.}
<A>__{alert sirens can be heard coming from the city. ray pulls the two of them.}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(yells in pain) ahhh.}
<A>__{they all lay on the hillside, gasping for air. in the distance they look... two robots are still picking people up out of the water. two more robots have joined and are picking up people off the streets. many people scream. with jaws clattering, rachel looks toward the other hillside on the other side of the river. shivering ray and robbie look there with her. three more robots are on the opposite hillside blasting people with their disintegrator beams. many more people scream. rachel, in fright, runs towards the bushes behind ray. ray sees her, and runs with her. robbie runs with them. they stop and squat down as they see the top of another robot coming over the hill to join the three. robbie, running, with clenched teeth, stops. his jaw drops as we are able to see hundreds of thousands of articles of clothing falling from the sky. they continue running through the woods where clothes fall like snow. pasture fence line dark robbie is walking 5' ahead of ray and rachel along a fence line of a pasture. gunfire is seen and heard over the hill about 500 yards away. robbie, who always wanted to help in the fight, begins walking faster toward the gunfire.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{robbie, slow down.}
<A>__{robbie follows the fence line and walks a little faster.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{robbie, slow down!!!}
<A>__{robbie, who is coming closer to the hill, sees army trucks rolling down the road and up the hill. seeing this, robbie walks into a slow run along the fence line. ray and rachel try to keep up.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{robbie.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{robbie. we got to stay together robbie.}
<A>__{robbie, getting closer, runs faster, faster.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{robbie! stay together! robbie!!!}
<A>__{ray and rachel duck as a missile comes extremely close to their heads. jets speed by them overhead. rachel screams.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{get back here!!!}
<A>__{robbie, in a full scale run, runs with the army trucks that have now taken to the hills. ray and rachel run as fast as they can to try to stay with robbie.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{robbie!! no!! robbie!!! come back!!!}
<A>__{robbie runs with the trucks with all his might. ray and rachel are now searching for him.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{robbie!!! (sets rachel down next to a tree) now don't move! for god's sake, stay right here! i'm coming right back!}
<P>__{(calling out for him) robbie!!!}
<A>__{ray sees robbie about 20' ahead of him.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{robbie!!! robbie!!!}
<A>__{robbie is held back by two soldiers. robbie gets thrown back by them where ray grabs him and pins him to the ground. robbie fights to get back up.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{why are you doing this???}
<A>__{soldiers are blasting everything they have to something over the hill. radio people are telling their officers "no effect on target". robbie is watching all he is able to see while ray tries to get his attention on him.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{listen to me! turn around! i want you to listen to me!}
<A>__{robbie ignores him and continues watching artillery blast over the hill. ray gets fed up with robbie. he grabs his shoulders and flips him over on to his back. robbie looks at ray in fright that he did that. ray grabs his coat shoulders, and climbs on top of him, pining him down to the ground.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{listen to me!}
<A>__{rachel watches helicopters fire missiles simultaneously over the hill.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{don't do this! i love you!}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{i need to be here! i need to see this!!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i know it seems like you have to but you don't!!!}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{let me go!!!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you don't!!!}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{please let me go!!!}
<A>__{rachel is approached by people. they think she's alone so they try to talk her into coming with them (ad lib).}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i'm not letting you do this!! you can hate me.....}
<A>__{robbie tries to fight to get up but ray keeps him pinned to the ground.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{... you can hate me. but i love you!!}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{let me go please!!!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i'm not letting you do this!!!}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{dad!!}
<A>__{ray sees the couple trying to get rachel to go with them. for a second, ray doesn't know what to do.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{just listen to me!}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{i need to be here! i want to see this!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{wait, stay. stay for rachel. stay for your sister.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{please let me go! you need to let me go.}
<A>__{ray and robbie are silent for what seems to them like forever. ray looks to rachel who is being carried away by the couple. robbie manages to turn back over to his stomach. after enough trying, robbie is able to squirm out of ray's grasp on his shoulders. robbie crawls out of ray's grasp and stands up. they stare at each other for a while and robbie begins running over the hill. ray runs over to rachel to get her back from the couple.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{get off!!! i'm her father!!! i'm her father!!!}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{we thought she was alone... we....}
<A>__{she doesn't finish as she scurries away. ray looks at the hill where the soldiers were firing at... a flaming army truck rolls over the hill.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{robbie?!?!}
<A>__{two more trucks come over the hill ablaze. suddenly... boom!!! a ring of mine charges go off at the peak of the hill. the explosion blast is almost big enough to knock ray off of his feet.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{robbie!!!}
<A>__{by now, robbie has run over the hill and is long out of site. a robot that appears to be on fire comes slowly rising over the hill. ray makes a run for it down the hill. we can see three robots now rising over the hill. missiles and bullets are being fired at them as their shields block all the fired artillery.}
