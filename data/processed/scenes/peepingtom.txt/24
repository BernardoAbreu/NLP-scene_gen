<A>__{the screen remains dark for a moment. we are with mark in a darkened room. he is giving a film show and we are the screen.}
<L>__{interior mark's dark room night}
<A>__{his cine projector points straight at us. a flickering light shines in our eyes. we can see him crouching behind the projector. mark leans forward, watching the screen intently... perspiration trickles down his forehead. he is breathing very quickly. the sounds of the party seep up from downstairs music, laughter, and a girl's yelp. there is a knock on the door. mark does not hear it. camera pans to the door of the room. it is blacked out like a photographic dark room. the knock is repeated. close shot of mark. he switches off the projector instantly. camera pans to an open cupboard in the corner. close shot of the shelves. they are stacked with spools of film. camera travels slowly over these spools. we see mark's hand add two more to the collection; his voice is overlaid.}
