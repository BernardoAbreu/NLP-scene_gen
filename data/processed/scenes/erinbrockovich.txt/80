<L>__{interior erin's house, kitchen day}
<A>__{close on the table, where beth is bobbing in her baby chair. on one side of her is a heap of bills with "past due" and "please remit" stamped on them. on the other, the well thumbed classified section, with circles and x's all over it. the doorbell rings. erin swoops in and picks up beth.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{come on, baby. maybe that's ed mcmahon.}
<L>__{interior erin's house, front door day}
<A>__{erin carries beth over to the front door, spies through the peephole, and sees ed standing there. she opens the door.}

<C>__{erin}
<D>__{now, why in the hell would you assume that?}

<C>__{erin}
<D>__{boy, are you ever a shitty judge of people.}
<A>__{ed takes a beat, copping to the charge.}
<C>__{ed}
