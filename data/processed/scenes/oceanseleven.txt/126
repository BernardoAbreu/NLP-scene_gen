<A>__{riding up...}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{you boys have a nice trip?}
<A>__{rusty, smiling, looks to linus, glowering, then to danny. before danny can explain the doors part at the mirador suite, where livingston greets them urgently.}
<C>__{livingston}
<D>__{we have a problem.}
<L>__{interior mirador suite on livingston's laptop day}
<A>__{a mug shot of danny, complete with vital information: height, weight, criminal history.}
<C>__{livingston}
<D>__{you've been red flagged. it means the moment you step on the casino floor, they'll be watching you. like hawks. hawks with video cameras.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{this is a problem.}
<A>__{a pall falls over the room: this is more than a problem, this is disastrous. only saul dares make a noise, humming and splashing in the next room.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{saul: time to get out.}
<C>__{saul }
<P>__{(as lyman)}
<D>__{it's time when i say it is.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{now!}
<A>__{we hear him jump to it out of the tub...}
<C>__{saul }
<P>__{(himself again)}
<D>__{i'm out.}
<C>__{rusty}
<P>__{(back to danny)}
<D>__{you have any idea how this happened?}
<A>__{before danny can answer...}
<C>__{linus}
<D>__{i do. he's been chasing benedict's woman. got into a real snarl with him two nights ago.}
<P>__{(off danny's look)}
<D>__{i was tailing you.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{who told you to do that?}
<A>__{before linus can answer...}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{i did.}
<P>__{(he and danny hold a stare)}
<D>__{i knew you couldn't leave tess alone.}
<C>__{tishkoff}
<D>__{who's tess?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{my wife.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{ex wife.}
<C>__{saul}
<P>__{(appearing in a bathrobe)}
<D>__{tess is here?}
<C>__{rusty}
<P>__{(eyes still on danny)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i didn't know if it would sting you, but it did.}
<P>__{(the most difficult}
<D>__{words he's ever}
<P>__{had to say)}
<D>__{you're out, danny.}
<C>__{tishkoff}
<D>__{he's out?!}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{it's that or we shut down right now. his involvement puts us all at risk.}
<A>__{danny and rusty face off, furious with each other.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{this isn't your call.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{you made it my call. when you put her ahead of us. you made it mine.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{this is my job.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{not anymore.}
<A>__{danny stares daggers at rusty. but he can see: everyone in the room is on rusty's side. defeated, he stalks out of the room, onto a balcony, but not without staring down linus.}
<C>__{tishkoff}
<D>__{but, but... he can't just be out. who's gonna take his place?}
<A>__{rusty turns to linus.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{kid, you up for it?}
<A>__{linus's eyes drift to danny outside whatever acrimony he felt before, he never meant to kick danny off the job. he nods, half cocksure half scared pissless: he's up for it.}
<C>__{rusty}
<P>__{(to livingston)}
<D>__{find everyone else. let 'em know the change in plan. curtain goes up at seven.}
<A>__{livingston exits. everyone else in the room staggers about, like witnesses after an execution. rusty steps out onto the balcony, perhaps to console danny, but (as linus watches them from inside) their words cannot be heard.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{tess is with benedict now?}
<P>__{(as nobody responds)}
<D>__{she's too tall for him.}
