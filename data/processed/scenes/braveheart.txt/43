<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior village of lanark day}
<A>__{it's market day in the village, busy with highlanders, merchants of all kinds, and a few special attractions like jugglers and fortune tellers. marion moves along a table full of flowers and fruit... william, concealed behind hanging baskets, watches her unseen, savoring the beauty of his beloved, bathing his soul in the sight of her. then she looks up and spots him, her smile sudden and luminous, before she remembers to conceal it. he moves up beside her.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i've missed you.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{shush. it's only been a day.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and it's seemed like forever.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{tonight then.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{my parents are growing suspicious! i can't keep meeting you every night!}
<A>__{playfully he pokes his finger under the collar of her dress, pulling up the strip of checked cloth he gave her at their wedding, which she now wears hidden around her neck.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{then when?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{...tonight!}
<A>__{tucking in the cloth strip, she hurries away, smiling. angle drunken english soldiers by an ale cask day they spot marion moving through the fair, glowing, beautiful. the soldiers smirk at each other; as marion passes, one of them grabs her wrist. it's the soldier with the scar, the one who's been staring at her.}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{where are you going... lass?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{let go.}
<A>__{a second drunken soldier pipes up.}
<D>__{soldier #2 why don't you marry my friend here? then i will take the first night!}
<A>__{the scarred soldier pulls marion into his big arms; she shoves him away with surprising strength, and he staggers back, to the laughter of his friends. then he snatches her again and kisses her hard on the lips. she breaks free and slaps him fiercely, hard enough to draw blood from his mouth. tasting the trickle, he slings her down against sacks of grain, and the soldiers are all over her, pinning her down, ripping her clothes, a full scale public gang rape. as the townspeople try to move in the three soldiers waiting their turn at marion pull their knives, keep them townspeople back.}
<D>__{soldier #1 bitch, who do you think you are?}
<A>__{he slams his mouth down against hers for a long, awful time, comes up clawing at her dress to rip it from her body... and is hit in the face by a rock thrown at great speed! it takes a moment for the other soldiers to realize what just happened, and in that instant william is on them. he wrenches one soldier's arm in a direction it was never meant to go, breaking the elbow, separating the shoulder, and slinging the howling soldier into his comrades. two of the soldiers leap at william, swinging their short swords; william ducks, knocking their ale cask into their knees; william lifts the whole table where they were sitting and slams it into the faces of two more attackers.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{william!}
<A>__{she shouts to warn him that the scarred soldier, now bloodyfaced, has recovered from the rock and is behind william with a knife. william sidesteps the first thrust, snatches a leg from the shattered table and crushes the man's skull.}
<C>__{market women}
<D>__{wallace wallace! william wallace!}
<A>__{but there's no time for celebration. there's blood and ale everywhere, and the fallen soldiers are yelling...}
<C>__{fallen soldier}
<D>__{rebels! help!}
<A>__{more soldiers hear the call and come running, reinforcements converging from all over the village.}
<C>__{village folks}
<D>__{run, william! run!}
<A>__{will sees the horse that pulled the flower cart and throws marion up onto its back. he slaps the horse's rump and it plunges with marion into the twisting village lanes. william darts off through the crowd, as the magistrate and more of his soldiers arrive dozens of them! william pauses out in the central street of the village, just long enough to be sure they've spotted him, and darts into a side lane in the opposite direction marion went; william weaves through the narrow streets of the medieval town, knocking over baskets, jumping carts. as the soldiers stumble after him, the magistrate looks down at his mangled soldiers. the one with the ruptured arm is lying in agony.}
<C>__{magistrate}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{...girl.}
<C>__{magistrate}
<D>__{what girl?!}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{...on horse.}
<C>__{magistrate}
<D>__{the girl on the horse! stop her!}
<A>__{the shout rings through the village; marion hears it, and when she sees more soldiers at the far end of the lane she's trying to take out of town, she urges the horse into an even narrower back alley. she sees a clear route to freedom... but the flock of pigeons pecking on the scraps thrown there behind the shops rise into the horse's face with a sudden thrashing of wings, and the horse shies against a wall. marion controls him, but a flap of her ripped dress has caught on a crude nail, and as the frightened horse lunges forward again, she is pulled off its bare back, her dress catching and ripping at the same time, dropping her hard.}
<B>__{william}
<A>__{reaches the edge of the town and slips into the trees by the river; the soldiers are running every which way, but they've lost him. thinking marion's made it too, william heads deeper into the trees. in the town, marion recovers; her dress has torn free! she starts to get up; but the soldiers' pikes appear over her, and the magistrate leers.}
<C>__{magistrate}
<D>__{so this is the little whore he was fighting for.}
