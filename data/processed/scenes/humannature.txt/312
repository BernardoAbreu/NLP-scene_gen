<A>__{lila, now in prison coveralls, sits in a dayroom with other women convicts. she is watching a tv mounted on the wall. puff is testifying.}
<C>__{puff}
<D>__{and so, gentlemen, that is my story. i agreed to testify before this committee because i hoped to convey to the american public that there is indeed a paradise lost. human beings have become so enamored of their technologies and their intellectual prowess and their fancy gourmet foods, that they've forgotten to look to the earth as a teacher. this is hubris, my friends. and my story of destruction and betrayal is proof of that. i will keep my promise to lila. i will shed this suit and go back into the wilderness. i will live out my days naked and free.}

<D>__{thank you. that is all i ask.}
<P>__{(to camera)}
<D>__{good bye, lila. i take you with me in my untamed heart.}
<A>__{puff stands and exits the auditorium. flashbulbs flash. in the prison common room, lila wipes a tear from her eye. she seems genuinely happy. she looks out a small barred window and sees a bluebird light there, then fly away.}
