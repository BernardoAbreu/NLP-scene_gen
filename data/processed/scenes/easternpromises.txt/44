<D>__{yuri steps outside the forensic tent. he opens the bag and takes out the note. he unfolds it to read, then smiles to himself.}
<L>__{interior helen's house. anna's bedroom morning}
<D>__{anna is drying her hair, looking at herself in the mirror. she turns off the dryer. there is a knock on the door.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{anna? helen enters looking anxious. we see stepan hovering in the background.}
<C>__{helen }
<D>__{stepan, come here. tell her what you told me. stepan stands primly in the doorway, strangely defiant.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{stepan, what? i'm late for work. he shakes his head angrily. finally from behind his back he produces tatiana's diary.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{who gave you that?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{it was on the dresser.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{mum, you can't go through my things.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{you wanted him to translate it. anna gets up to grab the diary.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{and he said he wouldn't do it so i've found somebody else. stepan explodes.}
<C>__{stepan}
<D>__{no anna! you don't go to someone else with this! you don't go to anyone! nasilovanie, it means rape. iglah, it means needle. prostitutcia, perhaps you can guess. stepan hands the diary to anna and then turns.}
<C>__{stepan }
<D>__{i go to wash my hands. he disappears. anna and helen are left in awkward silence. anna buries the diary in her dressing table drawer. helen looks at her with anxiety.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{anna, stepan said this girl ended up in the hands of the vory v zakone. do you know what that means?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{just because i'm back in this room doesn't mean i'm twelve again.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{you never listened to me even then!}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{look, if i don't find a relative in the next few days they'll put christine out for fostering. once she's in the system, she'll never get out again. a pause.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{who named her christine?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i had to call her something. it sounds like christmas.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{she's very beautiful. helen is now deeply concerned.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{if i can persuade stepan to translate it, will you leave the rest to the police? anna looks at helen, then digs out the diary and hands it to her.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{tell him i've heard bad words before. helen is about to leave. she stops in the doorway.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{your father used to say the vory are a contagious disease. there's no cure once they've touched you. a pause. anna smiles.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{momma, this is london.}
