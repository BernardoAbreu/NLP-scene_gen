<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{village night half the buildings in the town are on fire. desperate villagers dash here and there, herding children and animals to safety, trying to save their household goods. galen walks woodenly into the confusion, leading his horse, taking in the scope of the disaster. he comes upon a line of men who have formed a bucket brigade. he attempts to join up. as soon as he is recognized, he is shouldered roughly aside.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{get away, you little bastard. we've had enough help from you.}
<A>__{galen staggers back, reaching for his horse. the animal shies and trots off. a middle aged woman appears in front of him, her face contorted with rage. she swings a flaming broom and catches him on the back of the head. galen reels away.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{this is your doing!}
<A>__{galen looks up and sees a couple of burlies moving his way with boards in their hands.}
<C>__{burlies}
<D>__{get him! he's back!}
<A>__{before they can get too close, galen runs down an alley and bumps smack into a glassy eyed, haunted man. it is greil.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{greil help!}
<C>__{greil}
<D>__{may the lord forgive you for what you have done.}
<A>__{he pushes past. galen ducks behind a smoldering building. valerian's house the roof has burned off, but at least the walls are standing. valerian is wrestling charred timbers out of the center of the room. she is covered with soot. there is a hammering on the door and galen barges in. he slams the door behind him and puts his back against it.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{it's me. are you hurt?}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{where have you been? doesn't matter listen: quick! make it rain. that'll put the fire out.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{i can't.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{then get the animals back. they're all running loose. there's people been hurt. stop their pain. you can cure them. and we'll need food...}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{i can't do it.}
<C>__{valerian}
<P>__{(this stops her)}
<D>__{what? why not?}
<A>__{galen's hand moves up to where the amulet used to hang.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{i just can't.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{but you're a sorcerer.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{i'm no sorcerer. whatever power i might have had, it's gone.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{it can't be!}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{i know: i'm an imposter. a fraud. a fake. i'm sorry...}
<A>__{for a moment, valerian is too stunned to speak. then her face colors.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{you're sorry?! listen to that! the damn thing is loose, we're all on fire and you're sorry!}
<A>__{galen sinks to the floor and sits in the ashes.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{you didn't have the faintest idea what you were doing, did you? you're a fool and i'm a bigger one for bringing you here.}
<A>__{she snatches up a pitchfork and glowers at him.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{i don't want you in this house. get out.}
<A>__{but galen still sits there like a puppet with its strings cut, every dream of glory utterly crushed. this piteous sight touches valerian's heart. her gaze softens. she slowly lowers the pitchfork.}
