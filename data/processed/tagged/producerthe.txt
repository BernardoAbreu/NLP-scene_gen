<C>__{bialystock}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{you've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.}
<C>__{bialystock}
<D>__{what did i do?}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{you raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.}

<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{ahhhhhh! but that's where you made your error. you didn't go all the way. you see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.}
<C>__{bialystock}
<D>__{but the play only cost $60,000 to produce.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{exactly. and how long did it run?}
<C>__{bialystock}
<D>__{one night.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{see? you could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.}
<C>__{bialystock}
<D>__{but what if the play was a hit?}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{oh, you'd go to jail. if the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?}
<C>__{bialystock}
<D>__{aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!! so, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.}

<C>__{bialystock}
<D>__{what scheme? your scheme, you bloody little genius.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{oh, no. no. no. i meant no scheme. i merely posed a little, academic accounting theory. it's just a thought.}

<B>__{bialystock starts moving in on bloom.}
<C>__{bialystock}
<D>__{don't you see, bloom. darling, bloom, glorious bloom, it's so simple. step one: we find the worst play in the world a sure flop. step two: i raise a million dollars there's a lot of little old ladies in this world. step three: you go back to work on the books. phoney lists of backers one for the government, one for us. you can do it, bloom, you're a wizard.}
