<A>__{jacob lies in bed, holding rudy's old baseball glove. he brings the glove to his nose, and a flood of old memories come back to him. jacob rises, crosses over to the closet and removes a metal lock box. he selects 666 for the combination and the box opens. jacob removes the contents; baseball cards, some firecrackers, a few ticket stubs and a photograph of he and rudy at age 5. he can't help but smile.}
