<L>__{exterior fire night}
<A>__{everyone has gathered around the great blaze. in the center of the circle close to the fire, the buffalo men are dancing. others are dancing too. the music is very loud. the little buckskin is out of his head with speed. he doesn't answer the bit when dunbar first tries to pull him up. people scatter in all directions, as dunbar and cisco charge into their midst. dunbar pulls back with all his might, and the buckskin sits down. he's wet from his long ride, and dunbar can't stay on his back. as cisco rears, he slides off and tumbles onto his back. angry warriors pile on top of him. dunbar shouts out the word for buffalo, yelling it over and over as the warriors pummel him. so many men have rushed into the fray that none can deal the lieutenant a decisive blow. they roll about in the dust. just as dunbar's cries have begun to lose their strength, he feels a sudden lessening of the weight upon him. as the men pile off, dunbar is left flat on his back. his lip is split and blood is streaming from his nose. he's looking into a familiar face. the man's head is covered with the full skin and feathers of an eagle. kicking bird.}
