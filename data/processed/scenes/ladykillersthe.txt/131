<L>__{interior munson house cellar night}
<A>__{the professor and lump, responding to the noise, look slowly up toward the ceiling.}
<L>__{exterior mississippi river bridge night}
<A>__{the body is laid out in a garbage bag by the rail. the professor stands looking at it, contemplatively. lump stands looking at it, contemplatively. the cat sits nearby on its haunches looking at it, impassively. the professor muses:}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...t'was our ate brought us to this pass...}
<C>__{lump}
<D>__{what, professor?}
<A>__{there is the toot! of an approaching scow. dorr's manner is still absent, his regard still on the corpse:}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{our overweening pride... the old woman is a more potent antagonist than one had imagined...}
<A>__{he rouses himself, goes over to the bagged corpse. lump follows him and the two men hoist the body over the rail.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...now, lump, i'm afraid it falls to you to finish the job.}
<A>__{they let the body fall onto the scow passing below.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...the comedy must end.}
<A>__{the professor turns to lump and tries to hand him gawain's gun, but lump, uncomfortable, declines to take it.}
<C>__{lump}
<D>__{...professor, i been doing some thinking.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{oh dear. oh dear oh dear oh dear.}
<C>__{lump}
<D>__{maybe she's right! maybe we should be going to church!}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{oh dear, lump. i feared that those would be your words. not that i don't appreciate your giving the matter the benefit of your thought. but please recall, young man, our respective functions in this enterprise. i am a professor, the professor as you yourself so often say, the thinker, the "brains of the operation," trained in fact in the arts of cogitation. you, lump, are the goon, the hooligan, the dumb brute whose actions must be directed by a higher intelligence.}
<C>__{lump}
<D>__{yeah, i know, but }
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{no buts, dear boy! do not repeat the error of thinking! now is the moment of praxis! now, my dear boy, you must act!}
<A>__{lump reluctantly takes the gun that the professor thrusts upon him.}
<C>__{lump}
<D>__{i can't do it, professor! a nice old lady like that!}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{think of the riches, lump, that you and i alone shall divide! recall the dream of wealth untold that first drew you to this enterprise!}
<C>__{lump}
<D>__{but }
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{and reflect also that if you decline to act, forcing me to do so, then you shall no longer have any entitlement to the money! your offices shall have been nugatory!}
<C>__{lump}
<D>__{you mean you mean you're gonna kill her?!}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{of course! my hand would be forced!}
<C>__{lump}
<D>__{i can't let you do that, professor! a nice old lady like that!}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{you?! allow? not allow? what presumption! you stupid boy! you very very extremely stupid boy!}
<A>__{we hear the toot of an approaching scow this one very long, sustained under all of the following:}
<C>__{lump}
<D>__{oh yeah?}
<A>__{he points the gun at the professor and }
<C>__{lump}
<D>__{...well who looks stupid now?}
<A>__{ squeezes click on an empty chamber.}
<C>__{lump}
<D>__{...huh?}
<A>__{he turns the gun to have a look.}
<C>__{lump}
<D>__{...no bullets?}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{shows the foreshortened barrel as he experimentally squeezes the trigger.}
