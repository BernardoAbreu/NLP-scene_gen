<L>__{exterior taco stand venice and la brea night}
<A>__{a handful of customers under a mud sky. the throb of a distant helicopter. hull pulls into the lot beside eddie's bmw. he climbs into the bmw, tosses eddie a brown envelope; money spills onto his lap. eddie does a quick count, produces the fed ex envelope. the usual white stuff. hull's about to taste when the chopper swoops in with a sudden blinding overhead light. a bullhorn booms down like the voice of god.}
<C>__{amplified voice}
<D>__{this is the police. remain inside the vehicle. place your open hands against the windshield so that they are clearly visible...}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{christ...}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(a strategy)}
<D>__{spread the floor, dudley.}
<P>__{(rap sound effects}
<D>__{with rhythmic head}
<P>__{spasms)}
<D>__{a ga, a ga, a ga, a ga...}
<A>__{eddie starts the car, and hull rolls out the passenger door as the bmw races across the lot. two black and whites and an unmarked converge on the stand. hull can't reach his car. he vaults a metal rail and runs off between two buildings. hernandez jumps out of an unmarked and races after him. taft speeds the car out onto the street.}
<B>__{hull}
<A>__{running. police and sirens pursuing. he hurls the fed ex envelope into a dumpster. helicopter light sweeps over him. as he cuts around a building, taft opens a car door right into his face. hull goes down hard.}
<C>__{taft}
<P>__{(into car radio)}
<D>__{thank you kindly...}
<A>__{he waves at the helicopter which goes away, kneels over hull who is twitching spastically on the ground, gasping for air. hernandez arrives carrying the fed ex envelope.}
<C>__{taft}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{how you doin', child?...}
<A>__{hull is astonished to look up and see taft looming over him, the man he remembers from the videotape. he tries to speak:}
<C>__{hull}
<P>__{(barely audible)}
<D>__{you...}
<C>__{taft}
<P>__{(briefly puzzled)}
<D>__{me? of course, it's me. you know me?}
<A>__{hull shakes head, winces.}
<C>__{taft}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{hurts, huh?}
<A>__{hull tries to curse.}
<C>__{taft}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{here, i want to show you something. you have kids?}
<A>__{he takes out his wallet, opens it to pictures of his two children, a boy and a girl, seven and eight.}
<C>__{taft}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{these are mine. aren't they the most beautiful children you ever saw?}
<A>__{hull groans, twists in pain. taft sticks the pictures in his face. hull is affected by the children despite everything.}
<C>__{taft}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{yeah, i know, they kind of leave you speechless. so let me ask, if someone put a gun to your baby's head, wouldn't you kill him if you could?}
<A>__{hull just looks up.}
<C>__{taft}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{me, too. and you're the bastard with the gun.}
<A>__{he takes the fed ex envelope from him.}
<C>__{hull}
<P>__{(hoarse; his first words)}
<D>__{you know the difference between a nigger and a black man?}
<C>__{taft}
<D>__{don't jive me, boy.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{the nigger's the one covers whitey's ass by puttin' the brothers in jail.}
<A>__{taft yanks him hard to his feet; hull cries out in pain.}
<C>__{taft}
<D>__{you ain't my brother.}
