<L>__{interior courtroom day}
<A>__{sheriff moran sits in the witness box, blade thin and fidgeting ever so slightly. uncomfortable in the limelight. in his hands are four pieces of rope.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{well, this one here comes off miyamoto's boat. matches all his others, worn equal and so on. but this one here...}
<A>__{holds it up for hooks. so the jury can see.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side. and it's brand new. unlike the rest.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{and the next one...?}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{from carl heine's boat. all his were like this one, three strand manila, new condition, braided in loops. not bowlined like miyamoto's.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{and the last...?}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{found on carl's boat, too. starboard side, second cleat from the stern. but it doesn't match carl's lines. it matches miyamoto's. perfect.}
<A>__{ah. hooks nods. significant.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{so if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat. with that last one. would those cleats have lined up?}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{you bet. and if miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on carl's boat.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{and replaced it later with the new one. that's your inference?}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{pretty darn clear.}
<A>__{i see. hooks begins to pace. toward the jury.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{and when you visited defendant on his boat. the evening after carl heine's death. did it seem pretty darn clear to him?}
