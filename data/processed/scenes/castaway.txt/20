<A>__{christmas in russia. snow everywhere. brightly colored lights. chucks gets out of a volga with aleksei. he has a bag over his shoulder, the dented package under one arm.}
<L>__{interior fedex offices day}
<A>__{the staff has assembled near the loading dock. yuri the station manager stands in front, occasionally catching the eye of the attractive woman. chuck displays the fedex box.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{it took this test package thirty two hours to get from seattle to st. petersburg, a distance of nine thousand miles. and then it took forty one hours to get from our warehouse in st. petersburg to here, a distance of, what }
<C>__{aleksei}
<D>__{six kilometers. four miles.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{so how are we going to get this place shaped up?}
<A>__{there's a muttered chorus of answers.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{there's only one way. we have to work together. every one of us depends on everyone else. if one package is late, we are all late. if one truck misses the deadline, we all miss the deadline. let's start by taking a look around.}
<A>__{chuck leads his team through the sorting area. yuri squeezes right next to him, ostentatiously carrying a clipboard. chuck stops.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{here, this table is too far from the wall. packages can slip down...like...}
<P>__{(pulls out a package from behind a table)}
<D>__{...this.}
<A>__{he hefts the package, as if trying to guess what's inside.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{what could be in here? let's say one of you sent it. could be the closing papers on your dacha, could be a toy for your grandson's birthday, could be a kidney to keep your mother alive. i don't think you want your mother's kidney to end up behind a table.}
<A>__{the sorter shoves the table against the wall. yuri says something to the translator.}
<C>__{translator}
<D>__{he says they have been very busy. it is hard to get good employees. he is sure you understand.}
<A>__{wrong answer: chuck glances sharply at yuri. aleksei appears with a cellular phone.}
<C>__{aleksei}
<D>__{phone call. malaysia.}
<A>__{chuck takes the phone, opening his bag as he does so.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{kamal? right. i'm getting them.}
<A>__{he pulls out a set of blueprints and tacks them to a bulletin board as he talks.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i'm looking at the blueprints of k.l. right now. the belts are too small for the sorters. yeah, sometimes you never see what's right in front of your face. look, it's }
<A>__{chuck keeps an eye on what is going on in the warehouse. then he notices something over by one of the trucks.}
<C>__{chuck}
<P>__{(to a loader)}
<D>__{hold it! hazardous material needs its own container!}
<P>__{(back on the phone)}
<D>__{ three in the afternoon there, right? that gives you five hours until the sweep comes through. do the sort by hand tonight, then put in a new feeder belt, say a twenty four incher. yes, overtime is authorized.}
<A>__{he hangs up the phone. he turns to the crew.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i'm going out on every route, i'm going to work every job here, until i know enough to help you. that's it.}
<A>__{the crew disperses back to work. chuck and aleksei walk toward the office. they've done this before. chuck lets a corner of his command persona slip.}
<C>__{aleksei}
<D>__{it's bad.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{worse than warsaw.}
<C>__{aleksei}
<D>__{nobody remembers that.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{the failures they remember. it's the successes they forget.}
