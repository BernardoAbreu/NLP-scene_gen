<B>__{vitti}
<A>__{leaps to his feet and reaches for his gun, but instead pulls out a long sword. confused but desperate, he holds up the sword to menace the intruders, but the sword suddenly goes limp. he tries to make the blade stand up, but it just keeps dropping like a piece of soft rope. patty, eddie, and the thugs laugh contemptuously at vitti, while jelly looks on with an incredible stream of tears pouring from his eyes.}
