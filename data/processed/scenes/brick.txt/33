<A>__{brendan hides behind a tall clump of bushes. a moment later dode hustles away from carrows. brendan follows.}
<L>__{exterior street early morning}
<A>__{the sun is rising as brendan tails dode through the twisty suburban streets. brendan takes cover as dode stops by a white hatchback. a girl gets out of the car and embraces dode. her wrist is adorned with the same cheap plastic bracelets as the dead girl's arm. dode speaks quickly to her, she nods and speaks back. he hands her a slip of paper, which she tucks into a brightly colored address book and slips in her jacket pocket. they embrace again, dode walks off and the girl gets in her car. brendan stumbles after the car, but it is quickly gone. he watches it go, then follows dode back towards school.}
