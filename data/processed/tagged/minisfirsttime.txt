<T>__{close on:}
<A>__{the face of minerva "mini" drogues, 18, watching something. she looks extremely bored by the television images flickering across her eyes. she has a pretty face: large eyes, and pouty mouth. her knowing look is incongruous with a face clearly still that of a girl.}
<C>__{mini }
<D>__{i know what you're thinking. don't bullshit me, because i do... you're thinking, oh dear lord in heaven, please, i'm begging you. i will gouge out my eyes with the straw in my drink right now. i will jam every last kernel of popcorn into my mouth until i suffocate, just not another fucking teenage coming of age story.}
<A>__{we pull back to reveal her body, which is moving out of that awkward stage between adolescence and womanhood. though tall and thin, her hips haven't quite rounded. she's wearing a "fuct" t shirt and jean shorts.}
<D>__{mini (v.o.) (cont'd) well, relax...no prom night highjinks, no nerds becoming popular and no shakespeare set in high school...i promise.}
<A>__{close on: the tv screen. "when animals attack" is on. in a series of quick cuts: a zoo keeper is mauled by an elephant. a sport fisherman is attacked on the deck of a boat by a shark he and his buddies thought was dead. a pit bull clamps down on his owner's arm. an alligator hunter stupidly puts his head in the mouth of a just captured alligator, only to have it chomp down on his skull.}
<C>__{mini }
<D>__{since it happened, everyone's asked me how it all started.}
<A>__{mini's face registers no reaction to the gruesome images. we now see she is sitting in the living room of a well appointed studio city hillside home.}
<L>__{interior the living room evening a party.}
<A>__{teenagers of privilege and their uptight parents are milling around, dancing and chatting as a deejay spins tunes.}
<C>__{mini }
<D>__{i suppose the obvious answer is my eighteenth birthday...}
<A>__{mini dances with a few friends in a very short mini skirt and halter top. she clearly understands how to the drive the boys crazy and this is not lost on her mother, diane, 42, who stands off to the side, nursing a drink with some other hyper }
<B>__{aerobicized mothers.}
<C>__{mini }
<D>__{see, i was blessed with a terrific mom. not only is she a lush, but she also hates me.}
<A>__{diane is beautiful, but there is an essential hardness to her that comes from a life spent trading on her looks. the blouse and mini skirt she wears are inappropriately revealing for the occasion of her daughter's birthday.}
<C>__{mini }
<D>__{a few days before the party, i overhear her on the phone ordering me a male stripper. nothing says "i love you" like ten inches of man meat in your face.}
<A>__{diane and the other mothers are talking about mini's dancing.}
<C>__{mini }
<D>__{and knowing dear old ma, she'll try and nail him after the party...in my bed.}
<A>__{mini's friend kayla, a little rounder, but also brash, comes dancing over. she's swaying her hips provocatively at mini, almost challenging her. mike rudell, a tanned and trim man of 55, watches their display, clearly enjoying the way it's jump starting his imagination.}
<C>__{mini }
<D>__{that guy? our neighbor mike rudell, big shot tv producer and the guy my mom screws whenever the batteries run out.}
<A>__{kayla and mini begin dancing together in a very explicit way, clearly trying to make the adults uncomfortable.}

<A>__{the cake emerges from the hallway. the caterers begin singing "happy birthday", as diane turns to see it and her eyes flash rage. as diane comes storming over, we switch to slow motion.}
<C>__{mini }
<D>__{see, to understand me, you need to understand that life, in my opinion, is all about new experiences. "firsts" is what i call them.}
<A>__{as she strides across the room, the look of vitriolic rage on diane's face grows stronger with every step.}
<D>__{mini (v.o.) (cont'd) somewhere around fourteen, when i had my first...rhymes with duck, i realized that the goal of life, any life, should be to cram as many "firsts" into it as possible.}
<A>__{we switch back to real time.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing? i said wait until }
<P>__{(looking around)}

<D>__{surprise! mini's pov:}
<A>__{a collection of reactions from the party goers: the mothers are numb, the fathers pretend to be disturbed, while copping looks, and her friends are in stitches. some are even waving dollar bills. m}
<D>__{mini (v.o.) (cont'd) that was definitely a first, but more importantly, it was the first time i really understood my potential...and that's when it all started.}

<P>__{(grabbing his belt buckle)}
<D>__{i'm going to suck your dick, troy, you said i could.}

<A>__{mini looks across the yard to see... mike rudell looking down at her from the upstairs balcony of his home. he's dressed in a plush terry cloth robe and is smoking a pipe, which he raises in greeting. his eyes are locked on hers.}
<C>__{martin }
<D>__{well, when's he coming over?}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{tonight?}
<C>__{martin }
<D>__{tonight!? i've got a dinner with chapman. i've already cancelled }
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{damn it! why didn't you call me?!}
<A>__{rudell allows the folds of his robe to open in the breeze, revealing his chest and pair of silk boxers. he's in good shape for a man his age.}
<C>__{mini}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{hey, i didn't know you had plans!}
<A>__{mini responds to rudell's challenge, lowering a strap on her bikini top.}
<C>__{martin }
<D>__{listen, i will be home early so we can get the story straight.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{mini hangs up the phone, removing the popsicle slowly from her mouth.}
<L>__{interior the living room evening}
<A>__{martin and mini sit across from garson. martin appears cool and relaxed, a scotch in his hand.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{i really appreciate you taking the time to help us out. there's just a few loose ends we want to tie up.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{absolutely. what would you like to know?}
<A>__{garson opens his briefcase and removes a report. he starts}
<C>__{g}
<A>__{leafing through papers.}
<C>__{arson}
<D>__{there appears to be some question as to the time of death. you said you went to dinner and a movie }
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{detective, not to be overly sensitive, but do i need my lawyer here? because these sound like the questions one asks when there's a homicide investigation.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{mr. tannen, i'd really like to just finish this up, i've got real homicides that need attention. how about if i just ask you some questions and the one's you don't want to answer, we'll just skip?}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{that sounds good, doesn't it, dad? i mean, let's just get this over with.}
<A>__{martin looks at mini, trying hard not to allow his anger to escape for a second.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{fair enough.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{terrific...now, the preliminary blood report indicated she had ritalin in her system.}
<A>__{mini's eyes shift between garson and his note pad.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i wasn't aware my wife was taking ritalin.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{neither was her physician, he had never prescribed it.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{well, as you may have discovered by now, my wife had substance abuse problems, i'm sure there were many drugs she took without a prescription.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{i know, but it's an odd drug to be taking. it's mostly given to adults and children with attention deficit disorder to calm them. but in people who don't need it, it has the reverse effect, making them incredibly hyper and agitated.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{again, detective, i really can't say why she was taking these drugs.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{fair enough...mr. tannen, were you and your wife close?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{no...we led, for the most part, separate lives. we had decided to stay together for mini.}

<C>__{garson}
<D>__{i see...}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{listen, detective garson, i must admit i don't see the relevance of these questions. diane was an extremely disturbed person. haven't you interviewed enough people who saw her at her worst?}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{yes, but what i'm still unclear about is her time of death.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{well, that makes two of us... again, detective, we were out for the whole evening.}
<C>__{garson}
<P>__{(looking at his notes)}
<D>__{after dinner you saw a movie that night?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{that's right.}

<D>__{start time 9 o'clock.}

<D>__{what did you see?}

<D>__{ahh...my buddy told me the end is crazy.}
<C>__{mini }
<D>__{for god sakes, does he think we wouldn't actually see it?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{yeah, he slides down washington's nose with the bomb strapped to him.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{dad...don't give it away, he hasn't seen it yet.}
<A>__{martin turns to mini, giving her a fatherly smile.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{another demerit...}
<A>__{mini rolls her eyes at garson.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{that's okay...where did you see it?}

<D>__{11:30.}
<C>__{mini }
<D>__{with 12 minutes of previews. you didn't think we'd forget the previews?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{now, if there aren't any more questions, it is a school night.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{no, that about wraps it up for now.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{for now? detective we are trying very hard to put our lives back together, but every time you come by, it just dredges everything back up. we've told you everything we know. g}
<C>__{arson}
<D>__{i wish i could be more definitive.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{well, i'm telling you the next time you have a question, it had better be because you're charging us }
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{us?}
<A>__{martin momentarily freezes.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i'm just asking you to please let us deal with our grief and get on with our lives.}

<D>__{okay.}

<C>__{martin}
<D>__{chill?! believe me, we'll be chilling in a pine box if he figures everything out. you do understand they could go for the death penalty?}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{he's probably just trying to spook us.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{hello?! they don't try and spook you unless they think you did it!}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{it was a great plan, no one can prove we stuck those sleeping pills in her mouth, because we didn't.}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(seething)}
<D>__{well, if it was such a great plan, why am i cancelling business dinners to accommodate a detective who appears convinced it wasn't a suicide?}

<C>__{mini }
<D>__{was there any question?}
<A>__{mini's eyes move quickly enough past him that it's ambiguous to him whether she spotted him or not. martin watches as mini leans in and in slow motion gives her partner a deep, long kiss. martin looks ill.}

<C>__{martin}
<D>__{and?}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{well, if she was unconscious by 9:30, that means the car must have been running for at least two hours when you found her. an unconscious person can't turn on a car, right?}

<D>__{detective, with all due respect, could you get to the point?}

<D>__{martin, don't say anything.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{now, mr. tannen, you clearly had the most to gain from her death, but i've learned from a number of your wife's friends that she and mini had a strained relationship.}

<D>__{again, detective, my client won't be answering anything, so let's just cut the cat and mouse.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{i'd like mr. tannen to know that if he's trying to be a protective father by covering up something mini did, i'd be careful. the district attorney is viewing this case as an opportunity to show the public that the rich don't get away with murder in this town.}

<D>__{if it was his idea, give me one reason you should take the fall?}

<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(disturbed)}
<D>__{well...uh...you have to be careful about sh ...so how's school?}
<C>__{mini}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{you'll never guess what happened.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{i was voted valedictorian!}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{but don't you have to be }
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{the best student? i know! but the students took a vote and they said they wanted me to have it for demonstrating remarkable courage in the face of unspeakable loss.}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(smiling sadly)}
<D>__{i wonder how the real valedictorian feels?}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{like slitting his wrists with the sharp end of a protractor.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{is rudell out of his coma yet?}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{i don't know, why?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{why?}
<P>__{(taken aback)}
<D>__{mini, if he recovers, he may try to blackmail you with those pictures.}
<C>__{mini}
<P>__{(nonchalant)}
<D>__{oh...i wouldn't worry about that.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{but if the d.a. got those pictures, you could }
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{i'm pretty sure he won't be doing anything with them.}
<A>__{he looks suddenly very worried.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{mini, you're not thinking of sleeping with him to keep him quiet? because i've met people in here who could help us with him, if it comes to that.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{help us?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{they know people on the outside we could...pay to make sure he doesn't try to take advantage of you.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{oh, gosh, that's so romantic. it's like you're a real life criminal with connections and everything, but i'm a little surprised you haven't figured it out yet.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{mini's eyes glint ever so slightly, as she examines martin's face, almost as if he's an animal at the zoo.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{oh...wow, like i thought you were just playing along `cause i'm your only link to the outside world, but you really don't know?}
<A>__{martin furrows his brow, confused.}
<C>__{m}
<C>__{ini}
<D>__{rudell didn't send those pictures.}
<A>__{he suddenly becomes very still, as mini's lips curl in a thin smile.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{you remember, aurelio?}
<A>__{martin looks at her blankly.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{our cabana boy from mexico?}
<A>__{suddenly, it hits him. he looks almost nauseous.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{what a sweetie, i thought i might have to fuck him, but just giving him the camera was enough.}
<A>__{his knuckles tighten around the phone.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{you...you...}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{it was pretty clear garson wasn't gonna give up, and sooner or later he'd find enough to charge us. it just seemed ridiculous that we'd both end up suffering.}
<A>__{martins jaw tightens as his pupils go black.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{oh, come on, you would've done it if you thought of it first...you know i'm right.}
<A>__{the veins start to bulge in his arm holding the phone.}
<C>__{mini}
<P>__{(suddenly switching gears)}
<D>__{hey, listen, since conjugal visits are pretty much out of the question, i thought it would be cool if we tried a little prison phone sex.}
<A>__{martin stares at her, taking deep steady breaths.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{they don't tap these lines, do they?}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{i think i might even be able to open my blouse without anyone seeing...you ready?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{guard!}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{no? are you sure? i won't be able to come back for a few weeks.}
<P>__{(mock jealous)}
<D>__{wait, have you met someone in here?!}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{guard!}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{why, you old dog! i knew you wouldn't be single in here for long.}
<A>__{a prison guard appears behind martin's stall.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{guard! she did it! she just admitted it! it was her idea!}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{i guess this means i could start dating around too?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{don't let her leave! she's guilty! get the warden!}
<C>__{g}
<C>__{uard}
<D>__{okay, that's enough!}
<A>__{the guard moves to take the phone from him. martin clutches it to his head.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{you bitch! you little whore!}
<C>__{mini}
<P>__{(starting to cry)}
<D>__{daddy, why are you saying those things!}
<A>__{the guard struggles to rip the phone away, but martin holds on for dear life.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i'm gonna kill you! do you hear me, you little bitch!}
<C>__{mini}
<P>__{(sobbing)}
<D>__{daddy, stop! i love you! don't say that! i love you!}
<A>__{finally, the guard smashes martin with a billy club, sending him sprawling on the floor. martin screams behind the glass, but cannot be heard, as the guard hog ties him and drags him away by his feet.}
<L>__{exterior a high school graduation ceremony day}
<A>__{seniors in gowns sit awaiting their diplomas, as parents sit in the audience, fanning themselves with programs. mini stands at the dais, addressing the class.}
<C>__{mini }
<D>__{...as many of you know, the past few months of my life have been very difficult. i don't know how i would have gotten through it without all of you. i really think it is a testament to the love in this institution, that i stand before you today, as the first straight "c" student in school history voted valedictorian.}
<A>__{a few cheers go up from the rowdier students.}
<C>__{mini }
<D>__{again, to marvin tepperman, the real valedictorian, he deserved this and i want to wish him a speedy recovery. i spoke to his doctors today and they say, with medication and therapy, marvin should be able to attend harvard this fall.}
<A>__{a polite smattering of applause is heard.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{while i may not have excelled in the classroom, i think my recent experiences in that bigger schoolhouse we call "life", have taught me a few lessons that i'd like to share with my fellow graduates.}
<A>__{her classmates instinctively lean forward a little to listen.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{follow your heart and don't question it, now matter where it tells you to go. trust me, it'll open up a world of new experiences you can't even imagine.}
<A>__{principal andrews nods in approval.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{but as you listen to it, don't forget your family, your parents. don't forget they're people too, and while we may not always agree with them, remember to love them when they need love.}
<A>__{a few parents look almost surprised to hear positive things said about them.}
<C>__{mini}
<P>__{(voice breaking)}
<D>__{and i mean really love them, don't just pay them lip service. really do it...whenever you can.}
<P>__{(holding back tears)}
<D>__{i know i did, and i just wish my dad could be here today, so after this speech i could just walk down into the audience and give him my love right here...in front of all of you. thank you and good luck.}
<A>__{mini puts her speech down, gently sobbing, as the audience erupts. principal andrews moves quickly to console her.}
<D>__{mini (v.o.) (cont'd) like i promised, no prom night highjinks, no nerds becoming popular, no shakespeare shoved up your ass.}
<A>__{mini's fellow graduates give her a standing ovation. a few parents become misty eyed.}
<D>__{mini (v.o.) (cont'd) and in case you're feeling guilty about having no one to identify with but me, relax...}
<A>__{mini looks out across the crowd and a huge smile ripples across her face, as she waves to everyone in the golden sunlight.}
<D>__{mini (v.o.) (cont'd) ...there's a first time for everything.}
<T>__{fade out:}
<B>__{the end}
