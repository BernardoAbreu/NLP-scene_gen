<D>__{ready.}
<A>__{she wraps a bungee cord around nothing and pulls it tight. she then takes some dye and sprays it. a surface appears, floating beneath the restraints. it sheens in the light as linda searches for a vein. she slaps the surface several times. a small bulge appears, like a vein.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{propped.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{let s make some history.}
<A>__{matt lowers the hypo to the vein. but sebastian takes the hypo from matt s hand.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{nice try, sparky.}
<A>__{matt relinquishes the needle.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{come on, isabelle. you can do this.}
<A>__{sebastian lowers the hypo. the skin bonds and gives. the needle remains in sight after it slips through the visible surface. matt presses down on the hypo plunger, releasing a dye into his bloodstream. the gold liquid twists into a long snaking tube up and down the limb. it s the shape of a vein. the liquid begins to react. small flashes of light blip up and down the strand of color. ba bump.. ba bump... the heartbeat starts to speed up.}
