<A>__{gabriel and sierra stop for a moment, so he can pull off his outer shirt. for the first time, we see that gabriel has a large tattoo on his back which looks like this:}
<C>__{ix}
<A>__{he's sweating a lot.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{am i crazy, or is it getting hotter?}
<C>__{sierra}
<D>__{oh, you're crazy.}
<A>__{she hands him back the water bottle. he gladly drinks. when she takes the bottle back, she steps forward. the motion leaves them face to face. she pauses for a moment, just long enough for him to turn away. he doesn't. she kisses him. he doesn't really kiss back but he doesn't fight it, either. she puts a hand on his thigh, sliding up the inside. only when she reaches his crotch does he pull back.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i have a wife. and a daughter. they're waiting for me.}
<C>__{sierra}
<D>__{where are they?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{back at the car.}
<C>__{sierra}
<D>__{i mean, which direction?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{they're back...}
<A>__{gabriel turns, trying to get his bearing. the trees blur. he nearly falls over. he manages to steady himself.}
<C>__{sierra}
<D>__{face it, g.: you don't know where they are. you don't know where you are. we've been walking in circles for an hour.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{where's your car?}
<C>__{sierra}
<D>__{there is no car. that was all a...}
<P>__{(what's the word)}
<D>__{"pretense," i guess. an excuse to get you alone.}
<A>__{wobbling, gabriel sits down on a stump. sierra kneels down in front of him.}
<C>__{sierra }
<D>__{dizzy, huh? it's probably just the ghb. in the water.}
<A>__{she holds up the water bottle.}
