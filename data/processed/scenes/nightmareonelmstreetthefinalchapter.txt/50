<C>__{david}
<D>__{this isn't america, it's my house. i've been checking up on you. you have no record with the police or the state or any of the runaway groups. you're the invisible kid. and if i sense even a little bit more trouble making from you, you're going to vanish from here. got it?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{david catches his breath. he looks like he wants to say more, but doesn't have the energy left. he just walks out of the room leaving a frustrated jacob.}
