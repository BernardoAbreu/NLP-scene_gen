<L>__{exterior back steps of the funeral home day}
<A>__{clarice sits outside, with her head on her knees, drained. she looks up wanly as lamar appears, offers her a can of coke.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{thanks, i'm not thirsty.}
<C>__{lamar}
<D>__{no, hold it under your chin, there, and on your temples. cold'll make you feel better. it does me.}
<A>__{she smiles, touched, and takes the can. when lamar sees crawford coming outside, he tactfully departs. crawford sits beside her; there's a brief silence. she soothes herself with the can.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{when i told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you, didn't it?}
<P>__{(she is silent)}
<D>__{that was just smoke, starling, i had to get rid of him. you did well in there.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{it matters, mr. crawford... other cops know who you are. they look at you to see how to act... it matters.}
<C>__{crawford}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{point taken.}
<A>__{she looks at him a moment, then offers the can. he opens it.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{when we get back, i want you to run that bug by the smithsonian, see if they can identify it. maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... you found it, starling, you deserve the credit.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{i'm wondering if he's done that before placed a cocoon, or an insect. it would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... can we check back on that?}
<C>__{crawford}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{the other girls are in the ground. exhumations are upsetting for the families. i will do it if i have to, but }
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{then have the lab check raspail's head.}
<P>__{(he looks at her)}
<D>__{dr. lecter's patient have them probe his soft palette tissues... they'll find another cocoon.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{you seem pretty sure of that.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. and lecter knows him. maybe even treated him... you think so, too, don't you? or you'd never have sent me to that asylum.}
<A>__{he looks at her for a moment, then sips again.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{before we caught him, lecter had a big psychiatric practice in baltimore. but he traveled all over the country teaching, consulting... christ, even testifying in murder trials. who knows how many potential psychos he turned loose, just for the fun of it...?}
