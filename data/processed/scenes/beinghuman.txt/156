<L>__{exterior gas station night}
<A>__{hector is filling up the car in a gas station close to the safeway. an attractive woman is filling her car in the next line. her eyes and hector's meet. for some reason they exchange the smallest smile. for a few brief moments they are talking without words as their tanks fill. the ten billionth romance in the history of the planet sparks into life and fizzles out again in the twinkling of an eye. by the time their credit cards are back in their pockets their love is a memory. from the back of the car the kids have watched it all. betsy gives hector a withering look of disapproval as he climbs back into the car.}
