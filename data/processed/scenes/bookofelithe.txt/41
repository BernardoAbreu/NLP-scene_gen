<L>__{exterior desert town main street continuous}
<A>__{local residents scream and rush to and fro in panic as eli darts along the boardwalk. carnegie's gunmen pursue, firing their rifles wildly on the run. the bullets splinter wood, pierce barrels and crates, narrowly missing eli as he dashes, keeping his head down. eli aims the shotgun and fires without even looking. the shot hits a gunman square in the chest, dropping him to the dirt. eli hits the deck, diving for cover behind a junkpile as more gunfire ricochets all around him. he takes a moment to collect himself, reloads the shotgun. the three remaining gunmen close in on the junkpile warily. eli signs a cross over himself with the shotgun, looks to the sky and offers up a silent prayer. then emerges from around the junkpile back into the street. all three gunmen open fire, their bullets whipping past on either side of him. in one swift motion eli raises the shotgun and fires. three shots in quick succession. and then there is silence. smoke wisps from the shotgun's sawn off barrel. the three gunmen lie dead in the street. one hit square in the chest. the other two each have maybe one half of their heads remaining. eli looks around. he's right at the end of the main road, the perimeter where the town meets the open desert. he's free. and then, a girl's scream. distant but unmistakable. eli whips around. in the upstairs window of the theater, carnegie shoves solara roughly against the wall. barking angrily at her, shaking her. eli looks at the road. then up at the theater. then back to the road again.}

<D>__{dammit...}
<A>__{he marches back toward the theater, stepping over the fallen bodies of the gunmen, re loading his shotgun as he goes.}
