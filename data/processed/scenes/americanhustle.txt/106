<D>__{what the hell do i think i'm doing?! what the fuck do you think you're doing? you really gonna come in here and judge me for flirting with somebody after you've been fucking my husband for how many years?!}
<C>__{edith greensly}
<D>__{you don't have any fucking clue what's going on!}

<D>__{he doesn't love you rosalyn he loves me. and you know it and i know it and he knows it. and it might be done now, but it was beautiful and it was real.}

<C>__{edith greensly}
<D>__{you scare him, and you manipulate him, and you use your son!}
<C>__{rosalyn rosenfeld}
<D>__{well, he must like it on some level. he must want it because he keeps coming back for it. it's like that perfume that you love that you can't stop smelling, even when there's something sour in it. you can't get enough of it. but guess what, he's never gonna leave me. he's always going to want me, and i will make you so sorry, edith. i will make you so sorry for what you've done to my family, mark my words.}
<C>__{edith greensly}
<D>__{that is fucked up! i would never say anything that fucked up to anybody, but you do because you're gross inside, you're so fucked up and gross.}

<D>__{oh, i'm gross inside?}
<C>__{edith greensly}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{rosalyn rosenfeld}
<D>__{maybe you're gross inside, with robbing people and all that shit that you do? maybe we're both gross inside, that's what irving loves about us. at least he's consistent with his women. you know, sometimes in life all you have are fucked up, poisonous choices.}
<A>__{rosalyn reaches over, grabs sydney's face and kisses her. rosalyn laughs a toxic, tough front dark laugh and walks out. the bee gees "how can you mend a broken heart?" starts. sydney looks into the mirror and wipes the lipstick off her lips as rosalyn storms out of the powder room.}
