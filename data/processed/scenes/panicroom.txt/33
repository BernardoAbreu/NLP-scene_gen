<L>__{interior sarah's bedroom night}
<A>__{in the top floor bedroom, a nightlight burns in another outlet. nearby, sarah is asleep in bed, the covers kicked off. the door to sarah's bedroom glides open, terribly slowly. the man stands in the doorway, staring, aghast, at the mountain of moving boxes piled in the room. his gaze falls on sarah in the bed. the man just stares, beside himself. his lips mouth a word, soundlessly. doesn't take a lip reader to guess it.}
