<A>__{barnes pokes his head up from a concealed trapdoor thirty yards from blair and marcus, who are hoarse from shouting.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{blair? good to see you.}
<P>__{(off her glare)}
<D>__{what's the password?}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{eat shit and die, barnes!}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{close enough. who's your friend?}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{could you get us outta here please?}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{kinda dumb ass, wandering around in a mine field.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{you didn't maintain the perimeter! where are your sentries?}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{it's too early for that military crap.}
<A>__{barnes consults a map, turning it to orient himself.}
<C>__{barnes }
<D>__{ok, if you keep walking straight you're gonna get blown all to hell... turn to your left and take, oh... five steps.}
<A>__{blair and marcus obey, moving cautiously.}
<C>__{barnes }
<D>__{ok, face me now. three steps.}
<A>__{they do as told.}
<C>__{barnes }
<D>__{almost home. turn to your right and take another five steps...}
<A>__{they slowly pace five steps. on the fifth one, there's a click beneath marcus' foot a horrified moment of eye contact between him and blair she dives to the ground, away from him as boom! marcus is thrown through the air by the explosion marcus' body lands a few feet from the trap door.}
