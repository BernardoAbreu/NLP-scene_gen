<L>__{interior hotel corridor night}
<A>__{white stumbles from the room, leans against a wall for support. lights flicker. at the end of the corridor, elevator doors open. light and musak flood out.}
<L>__{interior lobby night}
<A>__{white staggers from the elevator, moves past a deserted front desk. a voice from the back room:}
<C>__{hotel manager o.s.}
<D>__{hey, you! you gotta message.}
<A>__{white stops, looks uncertainly towards a bead curtain.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{manager o.s.}
<D>__{message in d'box! you deaf?}
<A>__{white sees several nooks for messages and keys in front of him. reaching across the desk, he glances through the bead curtain into the manager's office. television sounds o.s.}
<B>__{his p.o.v.}
<A>__{hard to see the man sits in the chair, lit by the glow of the t.v. set. white grabs the note, looks at it. a phone number, also his room number, and what appears to be his name: jonathan white. that's all. white thrusts the message in his pocket.}
<C>__{manager o.s.}
<D>__{got my money?}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{what? i... how long have i been here?}
<C>__{manager o.s.}
<D>__{jeez, too damn long if you ask me! what about the two weeks y'owe me...}
<A>__{totally confused, white turns to leave, sees something. stops. his p.o.v. a painting on a wall (cheap print variety) waves on a beach. a breeze rustles the pages of a calender, pinned beside the picture. tight on white move in on his ear. o.s. sound surf crashes on shore. a woman's voice whispers:}
<C>__{voice o.s.}
<D>__{what is your name... what is your name...}
<A>__{he backs away from the painting, looks about the lobby in panic sees a sign: toilets. a painted hand points the way.}
<C>__{manager o.s.}
<D>__{hey!}
<C>__{white }
<D>__{i will be back later.}
<C>__{manager o.s.}
<D>__{yeah. well, y'better be.}
<A>__{camera reveals a figure watching from a shadowy corner of the lobby. as white runs out, the mystery man picks up a pay phone, dials. whispers into the receiver in a foreign language.}
