<A>__{principal claire sits with the kids in the living room. from outside, they hear the front door open, and the sound of ominous, squishy footsteps. then the door swings open, revealing shane, looking like a swamp creature. everyone gasps, then covers their noses. a cute young cop enters behind shane. todd stiffens. zoe fixes her hair. the cop looks at them.}

<D>__{14 year old male, weird hair. 16 year old female. ditto. (into his radio:) cancel that a.p.b..}
<A>__{the cop turns to shane, with a smirk.}
<C>__{cute cop }
<D>__{in the future, use our nonemergency number. that's the one to call if nobody's fleein' or bleedin'.}
<A>__{the cop leaves, zoe checks him out as he goes...}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{shane are you okay?}
<C>__{shane}
<P>__{(eerily calm:)}
<D>__{just fine, thank you.}
<A>__{covering her nose. the smell is bad.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i should probably get going then. if you need anymore help... call.}
<A>__{she practically gags as she passes him. shane looks around at scott and zoe, he doesn't say anything, but with his hand he makes a "my eyes on you" gesture.}
