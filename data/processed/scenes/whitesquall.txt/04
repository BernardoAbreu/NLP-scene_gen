<L>__{exterior wharf day}
<A>__{chuck stares out across the harbor. in the distance, the echoes of singing masts. shrouds and canvas softly ping. the small boats of mystic tug restlessly at their moorings.}
<C>__{older chuck }
<D>__{he had taken us to worship, where, what was for him, the holiest of holies. and, for us too by the end...}
<L>__{exterior doctors office later}
<A>__{chuck stands silently on the periphery of a gathering of people. they surround a small building, a neighborhood clinic. a worn gray stone, long in the earth, dedicates the structure. in memory of natalie "alice" sheldrake m.d., captain's wife and ship's surgeon of the brigantine albatross may 2, 1961 next to the stone a funeral urn. a young minister gropes for meaning.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{i didn't know richard sheldrake personally, but his many friends who knew and worked with him, wanted to make sure that he was returned home, here, to be remembered with his beloved wife...}
<A>__{chuck gazes out at the sleepy harbor, the minister's voice fading away. the afternoon wind is coming up with the tide. he quietly heads towards the water. drifting, drawn, lost.}
<C>__{older chuck }
<D>__{though he had moved on with his life, now even for the years, to hear him eulogized by strangers, seemed strange. he had been a hewner of stones, a pilot by the silent stars. like me, alone among many. but most of all for us, the crew of the brigantine albatross, he was always and would forever be... our skipper.}
<A>__{a ship's bell turns him around. ding ding. ding ding. a beautiful three masted schooner steady on the water slips into port. a picture out of another time, another place. it takes him away...}
