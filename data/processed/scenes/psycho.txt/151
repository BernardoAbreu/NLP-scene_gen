<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{sam and lila in truck (process highway) for a moment, both are silent; sam watching the road as if there were other cars on it, lila staring at nothing in particular, except perhaps her own inner fear.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i wonder if we'll ever see mary again.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{of course we will.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{alive.}
<A>__{sam looks as if he'd like to say something humorous, something to cheer her. he cannot. he remains silent.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{we lived together all our lives.}
<A>__{when we woke up one morning and found ourselves orphans, mary quit college and got a job, so i could go to college.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{where'd you go to college?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i didn't. i got a job, too.}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{i wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me? some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(almost to himself)}
<D>__{she was willing to lick the stamps.}
<A>__{lila looks quizzically at him, is too concerned to pursue it.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i wonder so many things about her now. why she never told me about you... funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{we were going to get married. are going to get married!}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{do you know how i found out about you? i found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, sam.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{this is the old highway.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{watch your tenses.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{she always tries to be proper.}
<A>__{sam slows the truck to a stop, sighs, starts to light up a cigarette. lila looks questioningly and impatiently at him.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{you going to wait here for me?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm going with you. but we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{we're going to register. as man and wife. and get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you won't believe it...}
<P>__{(starts motor)}
<D>__{but this will be the first time i've ever pulled one of those man and wife renting cabin capers!}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(a tiny smile, first in hours)}
<D>__{i believe it.}
<A>__{as truck starts to drive on,}
