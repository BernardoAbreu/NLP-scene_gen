<L>__{interior samantha's house twilight}
<A>__{caitlin huddles on the steps, itching at her brand new wrist cast. eavesdropping on her parents. in the kitchen a counter top tv is on, the three stooges. samantha is on the phone, saying:}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{yes, i'm three blocks past the gas station... right. thank you mr. henessey, i will see you shortly.}
<A>__{she hangs up as hal enters behind her... she doesn't turn around. samples the topping of a cream pie. stares at the linoleum floor. he regards her with angry, vindictive eyes:}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{she rode all the way home. she didn't fall, not once. she didn't cry.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you're good. you should work with kids, you know that?}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{she said her wrist hurt. i didn't know it was broken, god. i can't even remember what i said to her...!}
<A>__{hal takes a breath, composes himself.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{we can still make six o'clock mass, you coming?}
<A>__{sam surveys her perfect kitchen. runs her hand over a hanging pot. looks sadly at her husband. whispers:}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{a private detective's coming by, he... he's found something.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i may have to go away. for a bit. now please leave me alone.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{go away. with a detective. jesus, it's the holidays, sam }
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{are you deaf? i said leave me alone. go to church. drink blood. drink some for me.}
<A>__{they stand in tableau. an electric silence... broken quite suddenly by the sound of singing. christmas carolers. outside the front door. the sweet strains of "god rest ye merry, gentlemen" wafts in through the window. except the sweet strains ain't so sweet. these carolers are terrible. missing by a country octave. sam and hal look at each other, what the hell...?}
