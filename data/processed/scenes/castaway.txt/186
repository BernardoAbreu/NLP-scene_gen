<L>__{interior cave fire night}
<A>__{the fish are being smoke under a palm frond. eel skins hang from sticks, roasting. chuck sits by the fire, hafting a stone knife onto a wooden haft. he ties some fiber to a stick, then braids it into string, using both hands and his mouth for the three strands. he ties the string tightly around the shaft. he does his work automatically.}
<L>__{interior cave night later}
<A>__{chuck eats some fish and some mashed breadfruit. he chews each bite, his eyes in distant focus. the firelight flickers on his face.}
