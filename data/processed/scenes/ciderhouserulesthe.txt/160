<L>__{exterior cider house night}
<A>__{the cider house in the rain. mr. rose staggers out; he stands there in the rain, trying to regain his composure. he starts to scream. another angle: huddled under the overhanging roof, muddy and peaches and hero are watching him.}
<L>__{interior bunkhouse rainy day}
<A>__{rose rose, curled in a fetal position, listens to the rain on the roof. candy sits on her bed beside her. she helps her to sit up, to drink a glass of water; then rose rose lies down again. rose rose's expression never changes while candy talks to her. mr. rose lies in his bed in the exact same fetal position as his daughter; he too, is listening to candy. homer is putting away his instruments.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{the bleeding should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. the cramps will ease up, almost entirely. the bleeding is usually much lighter in two days. as long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.}
<A>__{muddy enters the cider house from out of the storm. he glances at candy and rose rose; then at homer. then he speaks to mr. rose.}
<C>__{muddy}
<D>__{it's that vernon he keeps askin' where you and homer and rose rose is at.}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<D>__{tell that vernon to mind his own business, muddy.}
<C>__{muddy}
<D>__{i told him that you all is sick.}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<D>__{tell him what you want, muddy you is the crew boss today.}
<A>__{hero and peaches, dripping wet, come inside. peaches is standing next to the list of rules tacked to the kitchen support beam.}
<C>__{peaches}
<D>__{look at that. them same damn rules is tacked up again!}
<A>__{homer has finished putting his instruments away.}
<C>__{muddy}
<D>__{why don't you put them damn rules in the wood stove, peaches?}
<A>__{as the men are murmuring their approval of this idea, rose rose interjects.}
<C>__{rose rose}
<D>__{i want to hear what they are, first.}
<A>__{the men groan, but mr. rose won't oppose his daughter on this subject not this time. he just lies there.}
<C>__{rose rose}
<D>__{homer, let me hear what they are.}
<A>__{homer begins to read.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{"one: please don't smoke in bed."}
<C>__{muddy}
<D>__{we heard that one already, homer.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{"two: please don't go up to the roof to eat your lunch."}
<C>__{peaches}
<D>__{that's the best place to eat lunch!}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{"three: please even if you are very hot do not go up to the roof to sleep."}
<C>__{hero}
<D>__{what do they think? they must think we're crazy!}
<C>__{muddy}
<D>__{they think we're dumb niggers so we need dumb rules that's what they think.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{this is the last one.}
<A>__{the men groan, in mock disappointment.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{"four: there should be no going up on the roof at night."}
<C>__{peaches}
<D>__{why don't they just say, "stay off the roof!"?}
<C>__{hero}
<D>__{yeah, they don't want us up there at all!}
<A>__{homer crumples the list and throws it into the wood stove.}
<C>__{rose rose}
<P>__{(to homer)}
<D>__{that's it?}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{that's it.}
<C>__{rose rose}
<D>__{it means nothin' at all! and all this time i been wonderin' about it!}
<C>__{peaches}
<D>__{they're outrageous, them rules!}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<D>__{who live here in this cider house, peaches? who grind them apples, who press that cider, who clean up the mess, and who just plain live here... just breathin' in the vinegar?}
<P>__{(he pauses)}
<D>__{somebody who don't live here made them rules. them rules ain't for us. we the ones who make up them rules. we makin' our own rules, every day. ain't that right, homer?}
<C>__{homer}
