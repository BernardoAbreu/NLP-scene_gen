<C>__{dr. patel}
<D>__{pat, you have to have a strategy. i told you earlier. you need to recognize these feelings coming to you, otherwise you will be sent back to baltimore. so when you get these feelings, you need to get to a quieter place, and be at peace with yourself, however you can.}

<C>__{pat}
<A>__{after the dinner at ronnie's, she said, quote, "we can go to the back house and you can fuck me as long as we turn the lights out." unquote. and she still wears her wedding ring. so she's a loyal, married to a dead guy slut.}
<C>__{dr. patel}

<C>__{pat}

<C>__{dr. patel}

<C>__{pat}
<D>__{no, not the books.}
<C>__{dr. patel}
<D>__{you said nikki's friends with ronnie, veronica and tiffany. so if you become friends with tiffany, nikki will think that you're a kind, generous, large hearted person, who helps people in need, who is basically thriving. so if you help tiffany, it will be good for you.}

<D>__{"dear pat, it was very emotional for me to get your letter, as i'm sure you can imagine, but i'm glad you took the risk of discreetly getting it to me through tiffany. this gives us a chance to communicate while i keep the restraining order until i feel safe. i must admit you sound terrific and i'm happy that you are feeling so positive and becoming a more loving and caring man, which i always knew you were. i was moved to read about `excelsior' and your belief in happy endings. i am also moved by your act of love to read the books i have taught at the high school. i'm sorry you find them so negative, but i disagree. i think they are great works of art that reflect how hard life can be and they can also help kids prepare themselves for the hardness of life. in spite of all these positive developments, pat, i have to say if it's me reading the signs, i need to see something to prove you are ready to resume our marriage. otherwise i find myself thinking that we might both be better off moving on with our lives separately. please don't react quickly to this, but take time to think about it. i'm glad you're doing so well. love, nikki."}

<D>__{oh pat.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{not that i give a fuck about football or about your superstitions, but if it's me reading the signs, i don't send the eagles guy whose personal motto is "excelsior," to a fucking giants game, especially when he's already in a legal situation.}

<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{they go by the philadelphia rules. each dancer is scored on a scale of one to ten, ten being the highest. you have to average the four judges' scores.}
<C>__{randy}

<C>__{pat}
<D>__{we suck.}
<C>__{tiffany}
