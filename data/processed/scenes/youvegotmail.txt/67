<D>__{i can't believe you were talking to joe fox.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{joe fox? as in }
<A>__{she can't even finish the sentence.}
<L>__{interior vince mancini's apartment a couple of minutes later}
<A>__{joe is standing at a table of food, his back to the room.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{fox? your last name is fox?}
<A>__{joe spins around, looks at her.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{f o x.}

<D>__{god, i didn't realize. i didn't know who you }
<P>__{(she trails off)}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{ were with.}
<P>__{(quoting)}
<D>__{"i didn't know who you were with."}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{it's from the godfather. when the movie producer realizes that tom hagen is the emissary of vito corleone }
<P>__{(continued)}
<A>__{kathleen is staring at him.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{ just before the horse's head ends up in his bed never mind }
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{you were spying on me, weren't you? you probably rented those children.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{why would i spy on you?}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{i am your competition. which you know perfectly well or you would not have put up that sign saying "just around the corner."}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{the entrance to our store is around the corner. there is no other way to say it. it's not the name of our store, it's where it is. you don't own "around the corner."}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{next thing you'll be using twinkle lights.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{twinkle lights?}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{little white christmas lights that twinkle. i use them in my window and on all my displays, as if you didn't notice.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{look, the reason i came into your store is that i was spending the day with annabel and matt. i like to buy them a present when i see them because i'm one of those guys who likes to buy his way into the hearts of children who are his relatives. there was only one place to buy children's books in the neighborhood although that will not always be the case, and it was yours, and it is a charming little bookstore. you probably sell $250,000 worth of book a year }
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{how do you know that?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i'm in the book business.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{i'm in the book business }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{oh, i see, and we're the price club. only instead of a ten gallon can of olive oil for $3.99 that won't even fit into your kitchen cabinet, we're selling cheap books. me a spy.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{absolutely. and i managed to get my hands on a secret printout of the sales figures of a bookstore so inconsequential and yet full of its own virtue that i was instantly compelled to rush over and check it out for fear it would drive me out of business }
<A>__{kathleen stares at him. she's speechless.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{what?}
<P>__{(off her look)}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{kathleen shakes her head. frank turns up.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{hi. i'm frank navasky }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{ joe fox.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{joe fox? inventor of the superstore, enemy of the mid list novel, destroyer of city books tell me something: how do you sleep at night?}
<A>__{patricia joins them.}
<C>__{patricia}
<D>__{i use a wonderful over the counter drug, ultrasom. don't take the whole thing, just half, and you will wake up without even that tiniest hangover. you're frank navasky, aren't you?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{patricia}
<D>__{your last piece in the independent, the one about anthony powell, was brilliant. i'm patricia eden, eden books. joe, this man is the greatest living expert on julius and ethel rosenberg }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{and this is kathleen kelly }
<A>__{kathleen glares at him.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you liked my piece. god, i'm flattered. you know you write these things and you think someone's going to mention them and then the whole week goes by and the phone doesn't ring, and you think oh, god, i'm a fraud, a failure }
<C>__{patricia}
<D>__{you know what's always fascinated me about julius and ethel rosenberg is how old they looked when they were really just our age.}
<A>__{everyone is stopped dead by this observation and looks at patricia, who smiles at them all.}
<C>__{patricia}
<P>__{(to frank)}
<D>__{i'm so happy to have finally met you. we will talk. have you ever thought about doing a book?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{oh sure, it's passed through my head. something really relevant for today like the luddite movement in 19th century england.}
<A>__{at the same time:}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{patricia }
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{frank }
