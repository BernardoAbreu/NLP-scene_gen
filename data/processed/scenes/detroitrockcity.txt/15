<L>__{interior study hall day}
<A>__{the study hall teacher grades papers. on the wall a picture of president carter hangs next to old glory. the words "be quiet" are written on the blackboard. students study, read, doodle, sleep. jam is at his desk touching up the word "mystery" on his drumstick. next to him sits beth. quirky, but cute, she stares longingly at him wanting to say something, but not having the guts. pleased with his work, jam puts the drumsticks on the desk and opens a peter criss album cover notebook depicting countless doodles of the kiss logo, the mystery logo, and renderings of peter criss. beth sighs and opens her own notebook. drawings of hearts fill the pages. in them is written "beth + jeremiah" and "i love jeremiah." then, one of jam's drumsticks rolls off the desk and onto the floor. beth quickly reaches down to grab it for him just as he bends to get it too. thud, they bash heads.}

<D>__{oof!}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{rubbing her head, she smiles and hands him the drumstick.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{no problem.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{he stuffs his drumsticks in his socks pulling his pantlegs down. jam and beth stare at each other. there's a mutual crush, but both are apprehensive about making the first move. both want to speak, neither does. they awkwardly go back to their notebooks. mustering the nerve, jam breaks the ice and whispers...}

<D>__{beth?}
<A>__{beth spins too quickly. her pen flies out of her hand.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{yes?}
<A>__{boink! the pen hits jam in the eye.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{ow!}
<A>__{feeling awful, beth moves in to help. the teacher looks up sternly.}
<C>__{study hall teacher}
<D>__{mr. bruce, miss bumsteen, is there a problem?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{no. no problem.}
<A>__{jam points to his eye.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{just a little pink eye. no reason to panic.}
<A>__{unamused, the teacher goes back to grading.}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{jam}
<P>__{(handing back pen)}
<D>__{it's okay.}
<A>__{beth resumes doodling feeling like an idiot. jam does too. ah, teenage awkwardness. finally, beth musters up some courage.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{jeremiah?}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{yeah?}
<A>__{she hems and haw, then...}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i wanted to tell you something... i...}
<A>__{suddenly, beth is rudely interrupted by high pitched feedback coming from the p.a. the principal's voice echoes over it.}
<C>__{principal's voice}
<D>__{jeremiah bruce, come to the office immediately...}
<A>__{jam throws a startled glance to the speaker as the class sings in unison.}
<C>__{whole class}

<C>__{principal's voice}
<D>__{your mother's here and would like to see you right away...}
<A>__{more feedback as the mike on the other end changes hands.}
<C>__{mrs. bruce's voice}
<D>__{give me that microphone... jeremiah, you get your sorry self down to this office, mister!}
<A>__{all the kids except for beth burst into hysterical laughter. mrs. bruce's tirade continues over quick shots of...}
