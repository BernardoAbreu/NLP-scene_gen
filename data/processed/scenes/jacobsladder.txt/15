<L>__{interior laundry day}
<A>__{a heavyset woman with a dark tan is standing behind a counter cluttered with laundry. a picture of richard nixon is still stapled to the wall. she looks at jacob.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{where do you expect me to put those? i don't have any room.}
<A>__{she tries clearing the counter, but it doesn't help.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{how 'bout over there?}
<P>__{(she points to a table)}
<D>__{no wait. do me a favor. bring 'em to the back room.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{they're awfully heavy.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{i know. that's why i'm asking.}
<A>__{jacob waddles reluctantly toward the back of the store. chinese launderers are hovering over piles of clothes. steam from the pressing machines shoots into the air.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(huffing and puffing)}
<D>__{where's wong?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{that's what i'd like to know. if you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.}
<A>__{jacob stoops to put the boxes on the shelf. there is a snapping sound and he winces in pain. massaging his back, jacob unfolds some papers for the woman's signature.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{how was palm springs?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{hot. where do i sign?}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(pointing to the line)}
<D>__{you got a nice tan, though.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{tan? what tan? it faded on the airplane. i'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask?}
<P>__{(she looks heavenward)}
<D>__{two hundred dollars a night, for what?}
<A>__{she hands jacob the wrong sheet.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no. i will take the other one.}
<P>__{(he takes it)}
<D>__{right. well it's good to have you back. see you tomorrow, probably.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{if you're lucky.}
<A>__{jacob smiles to himself as he leaves the store. he walks carefully. his back is out.}
