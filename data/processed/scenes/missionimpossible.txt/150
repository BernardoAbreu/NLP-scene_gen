<A>__{the 3.5 disk is ejected from the floppy drive. ethan pockets it and signals to be raised. slowly, his body starts to move up. as it does, a bead of sweat rolls down his nose, balling at the tip. ethan ignores it. but below him, he sees the floor tiles, four of them lit up under the wheels of the chair at the computer terminal. his eyes widen as he realizes something the drop of sweat falls and he catches it with his right hand.}
