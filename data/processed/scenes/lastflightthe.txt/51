<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior nikki's suite next morning}
<A>__{a mountain of trunks and other luggage piled on the floor. nikki sits down near shep who finishes packing a suitcase on the floor.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{don't we have to go like anything? the train leaves in twenty minutes.}
<A>__{francis leans casually on the towering pile of luggage. bill stands next to him, smoking a cigarette and calling ironically to nikki:}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{are you sure you have everything?}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(misses the irony)}
<D>__{i i think so.}
<A>__{francis clicks his tongue as he regards the pile.}
<C>__{francis}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{hardly seems enough.}
<A>__{suddenly, nikki gasps and rises.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{oh, my turtles! my turtles!}
<B>__{the turtles}
<A>__{are plucked from the tub and placed in ...}
<B>__{... a basket}
<A>__{by nikki's little asian maid. the fancy beribboned wicker basket has an oversized handle which makes it a rather improbable turtle carrier. bill secures a wire mesh covering over the basket and carries it out of the bathroom, handing it grandly to francis.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{here you are, francis! you're the custodian of the turtles! now don't fall down on the job.}
<A>__{bill walks off. francis calls after him, worried:}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{hey! i never tended turtles before.}
<A>__{nikki arrives with a bottle of water and soaks her hand.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{now, all you have to do }
<A>__{she gives francis the bottle and sprinkles the turtles with water from her wet hand.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{ is to sprinkle 'em now and then, like this.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{oh, yeah. i see.}
<A>__{some of the water ends up in francis' eye which he wipes with the basket's ribbon. nikki walks off and francis practices soaking his hand and sprinkling the turtles.}
<B>__{in the bedroom}
<A>__{five bellhops march in and, under the direction of nikki and the men, proceed to carry off the luggage, chattering in french.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{well, we're off.}
<P>__{(to a bellhop, about the trunk)}
<D>__{be careful of that one.}
<A>__{burdened with luggage, the bellhops file out through the suite. bill, suitcase in hand, follows them out, beckoning to francis behind him.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{uh, come on, francis! take those turtles!}
<A>__{francis hurries along carrying the basket, followed by shep and nikki.}
