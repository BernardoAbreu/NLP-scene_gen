<A>__{(12) interior motel room night the door opens a light goes on. vanity stands in the hallway, peers cautiously into a squalid, rundown room. she hesitates briefly, seems to sigh, then indicates she will take it. the manager closes the door as he leaves. she stands a moment, surveys the room. a bed and bureau, sink, a chair, hotplate simply the essentials. she pulls a dress from her bag, a pair of hi heels, some gloves, underwear. she hangs the dress on a rod, places the shoes beneath it, arranges the rest in a bureau drawer. she looks around once more flowered wallpaper peels from the walls. she rushes to the window, tears open the shutters iron bars obstruct her view...

(14) interior vanity's hallway night she runs from the room, cuts down the hallway, slanming the door behind her}
