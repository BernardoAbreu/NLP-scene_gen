<L>__{interior corridor traveling with kirk}
<A>__{as kirk steps out, and the doors snap closed behind him. in the corridor the furor of the hurried depar ture is, as everywhere, quite evident: crew members move back and forth. but kirk does not see them; his mind is tormented by the transporter accident was there something he should have done, could have done, to prevent it? should he launch on schedule with the starship this unready? has he done right in yielding to this terrible needs for starship command again, forcing starfleet to give her to him? would decker's knowledge of the new design have prevented the acci dent? kirk reaches a corridor intersection, looks around, realizes he's lost track of where he is. a passing yeoman stops in response to his puzzled expression.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{turboshaft eight...?}
<C>__{yeoman}
<D>__{back that way, sir.}
<A>__{she's indicating back the direction from which kirk came. he nods his thanks, turns and moves back down the corridor.}
<B>__{decker}
<A>__{hurrying down the corridor. the two face each other a silent moment, decker studying kirk curiously.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{we'll have to replace commander sonak. i'd still like a vulcan there, if possible...}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{none available, captain. there's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{you are, mister decker. i'm afraid you'll have to double as science officer.}
<A>__{and kirk moves on, decker stands gazing reflectively after him.}
