<D>__{you think you are christians, and yet you see your so called white christian brother hanging black christians on trees. you say that white man loves you and yet he has done every evil act against you. he has everything while he is living and tells you to be a good slave and when you die you will have more than he has in beulah's land. we so called negroes are in pitiful shape. get off your knees praying to a picture of a white, pale blond, and blue eyed jesus. come out of the sky. build heaven on earth. islam is the black man's true religion.}
