<A>__{angle looking straight down. below us, tommy williams lies facedown at norton's feet. blood is spreading, fanning out oa the pavement. norton turns, strolls out of frame.}
<C>__{red }
<D>__{i guess after tommy was killed, andy decided he'd been here just about long enough.}

<C>__{norton}
<D>__{lickety split. i wanna get home.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{just about done, sir.}
<A>__{norton crosses to the wall safe and works the dial, his back turned. this time, though, we stay on andy: he pulls up his sweater, yanks out a large black book and a stack of files, lays them on the desk. he then grabs the real ledger and files, jams them down his pants and smoothes his sweater down. he picks up the bogus stack, crosses to norton, and shoves everything in.}
