<A>__{rain on the streets. a man, covered in tattoos an affluent hood, is in a doorway snorting snuff dominic, jones and several other cops emerge from hiding places, pointing their guns at the man who puts his hands up. hand held cameras follow several other cops and lilly as they move into the building, again catching various hoods unaware. lilly moves forward quickly, down a hallway and finds what she is looking for. in a room she discovers a harem of prostitutes, none of them older than ten years old. she stares at their doll like faces, then lowers her gun. we see lilly, the scars from edgar's attack now healed but still apparent on her neck. her hair is shorter; she seems more worn down. jones appears on her shoulder.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{take them away from here.}
<A>__{jones nods as lilly walks off.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{you don't feel like a drink?}
<A>__{but lilly doesn't respond, she just walks off. jones watches her leave. then he stares at the round faces of the children in front of him, something approaching compassion there.}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{now my girls, anyone hungry?}
