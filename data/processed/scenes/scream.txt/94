<L>__{interior attic continuous}
<A>__{the attic is long and narrow...cluttered with furniture, boxes, and the likes...moonlight filters in through a small raised window on the front wall of the house. sidney moves through the attic...bumping into this, knocking over that...she passes a dusty mirror, jumping at her own reflection. she cringes at her image, drenched in billy's blood. she stares long and hard...something about the blood, the redness of it. she moves on, determined. she eyes the raised window above her...a way out...if she could only reach it...}
