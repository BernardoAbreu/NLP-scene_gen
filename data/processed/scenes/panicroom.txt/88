<L>__{exterior great lawn day}
<A>__{ in the middle of the great lawn, in central park. she stands, turns in a circle, she's completely alone on the great green grassy plain in the middle of a beautiful spring day, tall buildings sparkling in the distance. meg stretches her arms out, smiles, but far off in the distance, she hears a voice calling to her, dimly:}
<C>__{sarah }
<D>__{mom?! mom!!}
<A>__{meg ignores the voice, she's so happy to be out here, out in the open, in the beautiful wide open, she could stay here forever, she spins around, throws her head back, but there's that voice again, insistent:}
<C>__{sarah }
<D>__{mom, please!!}
<A>__{there is the sharp sound of a slap, and meg's face abruptly jerks to the side. she touches her cheek, confused, as a hot red handprint rises up on it. what the hell was that? bam! now the perfect spring day is shattered suddenly by a deafening crunch. the smile vanishes from meg's face, she turns. where did that come from? bam! another one, even louder. meg's whole body winces at the sound. bam! a third one, and on this one meg falls to her knees, covering her ears, walls spring up around her, right there on the great lawn, we rush in on her, the walls close in, and she's right back }
