<L>__{interior labyrinth corridor night}
<A>__{o'connell, evelyn and jonathan race down the labyrinth, slapping at themselves and picking locusts out of their hair}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{did you see that!? grasshoppers! billions of grasshoppers!}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{that's one of the plagues, right? the grasshopper plague!}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{this is not a plague. it's generational. every so many years the locusts of egypt have a population explosion and they all take flight.}
<A>__{evelyn steps forward, something squishes. o'connell lowers his torch, the entire floor is filled with slimy frogs.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{okay,... and what about frogs?}
