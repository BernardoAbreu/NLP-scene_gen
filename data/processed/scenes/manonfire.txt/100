<L>__{interior traditional restaurant mexico city night}
<A>__{a mariachi band roams. we see creasy but not who he's with. a date? as we come around it's pinta. sitting with them, rayburn and his wife. and a sleeping four year old. note: rethink following dialogue with reference to creasy rayburn background.}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{my dad said all your friends were dead.}
<C>__{rayburn}
<D>__{all but one. the most important one. when we were eighteen, we made an agreement to "take the world" together.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{then one day, he calls and says, 'i'm in love and i'm moving to mexico.' i said what happened to the plan?}
<C>__{rayburn}
<D>__{i said the plan was right here.}
<A>__{rayburn looks at beautiful 19 year old alicia and their four year old son sleeping.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{i hung up on him. when i met alicia, i got it.}
<A>__{alicia blows creasy a kiss.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{can i kiss her now, or after you've gone to bed?}
<A>__{laughter.}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{okay, i think now is as good as time as any.}
<A>__{she takes out a velvet pouch from her pocket. she holds it out to creasy. he looks at her, takes it from her hand. his thick fingers fumble with a delicate drawstring. pinta waits for his reaction as creasy pours a simple, but fine medallion and chain into the palm of his hand.}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{i bought it with my own money. i saved it.}
<A>__{creasy is really affected, tries to hide it. she takes it, slips it over his head.}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{it's st. jude, the patron saint of lost causes.}
<C>__{rayburn}
<D>__{and hard cases. creasy's the reason st. jude became a saint in the first place.}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{yeah, that's right.}
<A>__{creasy looks at it, considers.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{thank you, pinta, it's beautiful.}
<A>__{pinta kisses him. as the mariachi band drifts over, rayburn grabs his wife by the hand.}
<C>__{rayburn}
<D>__{come on, baby. i feel like a third wheel. watch the kid.}
<A>__{they dance. a waiter steps over, refills creasy's water glass. as he drinks...}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{could i ask you a question?}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{could i stop you?}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{you don't drink like you used to.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{that's not a question.}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{i know because i go in your room and check the bottles.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{still not a question.}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{my mom drinks, too... why do people drink, creasy?}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{now that's a question. i don't know about your mom. for me, the problem isn't in the glass. the problem's in between my ears.}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{you think too much?}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{yeah. because at one time, i didn't think enough.}
<A>__{pinta nods, thinks she understands.}
