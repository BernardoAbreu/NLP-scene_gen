<A>__{richie curbs the cab as the guy goes into a dingy pizza parlor. richie climbs out, crosses the street. coming past the place, he tries to look inside without breaking stride. from around a corner, striding toward him, come four men looking like gestapo thugs in leather coats, manicured hair the princes of the city. richie detours into an alley as they enter the restaurant. richie peers in at the restaurant kitchen through a grimy basement window. watches trupo and his siu detectives burst in, guns drawn. they rough everybody up, get some down on the floor. one detective gathers the money and stuffs it in a bag. another gathers the dope. the mechanic tries to protest and trupo slaps him down with his pistol. richie keeps watching as the ny cops arrest no one but take the dope and the money (richie's money) and stride out as abruptly as they appeared, like bandits. as they come past richie }
