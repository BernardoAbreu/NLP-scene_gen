<L>__{interior kitchen}
<A>__{as jack comes into the kitchen, he finds frank searching through a cabinet. he watches for a moment.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what're you looking for?}
<A>__{frank turns quickly, surprised.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i didn't hear you come in.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what're you doing?}
<C>__{frank}
<A>__{oh ... i was just hoping for something to drink. but it seems the old lady was dry. not even a bottle of cooking sherry. jack nods. frank looks nervous.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{uh, we already boxed some things. i figured you'd want to go through dad's stuff. it's in there. if you want to get started.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{later.}
<A>__{frank nods. silence.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{is everything done? the arrangements, i mean.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{oh. yeah. it was all worked out before, you know. she and dad had taken care of it.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i set it for wednesday. the ceremony. they're doing the stone today.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{it's okay? wednesday?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah, fine.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{there's not going to be a viewing. i figured with the kids and all ...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{jack glances around the room. pictures on the walls. handmade curtains, lightly faded.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it's funny. before, whenever i came here, the house seemed small. but today ... i can't keep up with it. i keep losing my wind.}
<A>__{frank smiles slightly and he and jack lock eyes for a moment.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing;glancing away)}
<D>__{god, i could use a drink.}
<A>__{jack hesitates, then pulls a bottle out of his coat.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{oh. well, great. i will get a couple glasses.}
<A>__{frank moves to a cabinet, but there's nothing there.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{damn. donna must've packed them up this morning.}
<A>__{jack holds out the bottle.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(showing the seal is unbroken)}
<D>__{bought it on the way over. clean as a nun.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no, it's not that. i ... can't drink from the bottle. i ... gag.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh, yeah, right. i forgot.}
<A>__{frank looks embarrassed.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(remembering)}
<D>__{oh, hey, i want to show you something. come on.}
<A>__{jack follows frank back into the front room. frank stands before one of the tiny matching pianos and gestures jack to the other.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{hit the c. go ahead.}
<A>__{jack steps over to the other piano and taps, then frank does the same. jack glances up in surprise.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i'm right, aren't i? they're in tune.}
<A>__{jack hits the note again and nods in amazement.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{all these years. she kept them in tune. can you imagine? now why would she do something like that?}
<A>__{frank looks down at the keys and his smile fades. suddenly he notices the collection of tiny souvenir shot glasses on top of the piano, each bearing the name of a different hotel.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{hey, what do you know. looks like we can have that drink after all.}
<P>__{(picking up a few glasses)}
<D>__{what's your pleasure? we got the downtown ramada. we got the travelodge on route 41. and ... the mallory.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i will take the mallory.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{good choice.}
<A>__{frank blows some dust off the glasses.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{looks like these got a few years on them.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{this'll kill 'em.}
<A>__{jack pours and he and frank settle on the tiny piano benches. as frank swallows, he winces.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{jesus.}
<A>__{it suddenly grows silent, each sitting in his old familiar place, staring into his glass.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how're your hands?}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{oh. fine. it was nothing. couple sore knuckles. nothing.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you know, that night, i ... it just all came up.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yeah, i know. me, too.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i mean, you can play. you're okay.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i can keep the beat.}
<A>__{jack smiles slightly, then both go back to their glasses.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{charlie called.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yeah. larry shelton. blackie. couple others. donna said even lloyd called the other day. nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{jack and frank lock eyes again. frank's glance drops to jack's glass.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{jesus, when was the last time we played the mallory?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{five years ago.}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{november.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{right. it was someone's birthday. halloran?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{daughter's. sweet sixteen.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{christ, that's right. how could i forget. what a nightmare.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{she asked for it.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i told halloran we didn't do vocals, but he said:}
<C>__{jack and frank}
<P>__{(in unison)}
<D>__{what my sissy wants, my sissy gets.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{she got it all right.}
<A>__{jack and frank glance at one another, little boy mischief glowing in their faces. suddenly they swivel on the pianos and begin to play "you're sixteen."}
<C>__{jack and frank}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{she comes on like a dream peaches and cream lips like strawberry wine she's sixteen, she's beautiful and she's mine. ribbons and curls ooh, what a girl eyes that sparkle and shine you're sixteen, you're beautiful, and you're mine.}
<A>__{as jack and frank finish, they're laughing. after a moment, their voices die and the house is quiet again. full of ghosts. each stares at the tiny keyboard before him, awkward with the intimacy of the moment. it is quiet for a very long time. finally, frank looks over.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{well ... one more time?}
<A>__{jack glances up and sees frank has his empty glass held out. he hesitates, then picks up the bottle.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{one more time.}
