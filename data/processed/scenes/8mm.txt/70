<A>__{welles and mrs. mathews eat at a picnic table on the patio.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{it's very important you don't let this raise your expectations. it's not going to effect any ongoing efforts. all i'm saying is, please know, i'm not here to create any false hope.}
<C>__{mrs mathews}
<D>__{they hired you. you're like, a private detective?}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{that's exactly what i am.}
<A>__{mrs. mathews chews, staring off into the distance.}
<C>__{mrs mathews}
<D>__{i didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on tv.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{you probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat. drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. want to know what it's really like? it's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. glamorous, huh? and the guy who hired you, he has a hair lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.}
<A>__{mrs. mathews smiles.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{it's refreshing to actually sit down and meet someone face to face, someone nice like you.}
<A>__{welles smiles. mrs. mathews takes out a cigarette. welles lights her, joins her in smoking, refers to his clipboard.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{so, she didn't leave a note? she never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?}
<C>__{mrs mathews}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{she just seemed... depressed... ?}
<C>__{mrs mathews}
<D>__{she didn't seem herself. for months there never was any way to get her to talk about it. one night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone. she took some clothes.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{what was she running from?}
<C>__{mrs mathews}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{if there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but i have to ask. your husband... he committed suicide?}
<C>__{mrs mathews}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{september 4th, 1993. about a year after mary disappeared.}
<C>__{mrs mathews}
<D>__{we were divorced by then. things fell apart... he was living with a friend...}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{why do you think he did it?}
<C>__{mrs mathews}
<D>__{it got to be too much for him.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{you have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?}
<C>__{mrs mathews}
<D>__{there wasn't anything like that. the police and the fbi people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never. my husband... his heart broke when mary left...}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{i didn't mean to...}
<C>__{mrs mathews}
<D>__{you try going through what we did. bob couldn't take it, that's all. christ, there's times when it still seems like i can't either.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{i had to ask. i apologize.}
<C>__{mrs mathews}
<D>__{no one knows what it's like. you can't even imagine how much it hurts.}
<A>__{welles is miserable. a few customers walk past, looking at mrs. mathews. she tries not to notice then noticing.}
<C>__{mrs mathews}
<D>__{people remember me from the news.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{can you drive me back now?}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{of course.}
