<A>__{in the chart house. peter fires several more shots into the closet door. bullet holes appear just where the creature's head should be. there seems to be no way that the volley could have missed. silence for a moment. peter still holds his gun high. then, with a great crash, the closet door flies open into the room. two small children burst out. one has no left arm; the other has been bleeding from a great wound in his side. they are dead. they move directly toward peter. their heads are at least a foot shorter than the bullet holes in the closet door. peter stares down at the creatures, revulsed. he is so startled that he cannot react quickly enough, and they are on him. the moment he feels their clammy grasp, he regains his survival instincts. he cannot effectively aim his rifle. he kicks and thrashes around. one creature flies against a wall. the other is about to bite the man's arm. the big black grabs the small zombie and flings it physically back. the other creature pounces on his back. he throws it over his shoulders and it crashes against its brother. now peter raises his gun. as the children try to scramble to their feet the man fires several shots in rapid succession. first one creature falls; then the other. peter continues to fire, his eyes wide with desperation and disgust. finally his weapon clicks. it is out of ammunition. peter breathes heavily. he stares at the small corpses. instinctively, he begins loading his weapon, without even looking at the action, as he backs wearily out toward the door of the chart house.}
