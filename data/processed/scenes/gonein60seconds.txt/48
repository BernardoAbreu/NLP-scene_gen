<D>__{329 hro. there's no want on the license at this time...}
<A>__{castlebeck looks disappointed... otto grins ... castlebeck stares at the caddy, still unconvinced...}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{you're thinking: okay, there's no want ... but they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?}
<C>__{detective castlebeck}
<D>__{something like that }
<A>__{memphis opens the driver's side door ... gestures castlebeck in ... castlebeck gets behind the wheel ...}
