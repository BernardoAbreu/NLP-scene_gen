<A>__{a few minutes later. utah and pappas leaning on his car. the younger agent seems to have regained his hunt down fever.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{... so i started tailing him.}
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{this zen master surfer.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{bodhi, yeah. i'm on him all day, right. he goes here, he goes there, he goes to tower records and buys come cds, he has lunch at patrick's road house...}
<P>__{(mock casual)}
<D>__{... he goes into the assured trust savings and loan.}
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{did he rob it?}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{cute. he was inside for about 20 minutes. the other guy, roach, waited in the truck. they were scoping it out, right?!}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{yeah, or cashing a check.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{wait, wait. then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit. load it in bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit. you see? summer's almost over. they're splitting. they're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow. the next day at the outside latest. i got a feeling.}
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{last time you got a feeling i had to kill a man, which i always hate because it looks bad on the report.}

<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{alright, look... banks are closed. nothing's gonna go down tonight, right? so we'll be on these guys like white on rice... first thing tomorrow morning. okay? tomorrow. okay?}
<A>__{utah nods. then grins. pappas starts backing up, like a long rubber band which was stretched taut is pulling him back into the house.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{woof, woof.}
