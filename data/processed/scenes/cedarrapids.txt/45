<L>__{interior stairwell a little while later}
<A>__{deanzie sips from a mini bar bottle of rum as tim, now in a flannel bathrobe and slippers, enters the dingy stairwell.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{what the heck is going on here?}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{you sound like my fuckin' wife, timbo. jesus. ex, i should say. ex.}
<A>__{dean sits heavily on the cement stairs. he hiccups, burps. tim looks at dean with a feeling that borders pity.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{are you drunk?}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{fuck yeah!}
<P>__{(calms himself, whispers)}
<D>__{fuck yeah. but we didn't get to finish our little confab back at the bar. i figured some shit out.}
<C>__{dean }
<D>__{like i told you, no shocker helgesson's buttering you up to get you in his camp, because he knows you and me are close...}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{we're not close...}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{close enough. you're voting for me for president, right?}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{no i'm not.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{well anyway, there's a petition going around trying to take away your company's two diamond awards.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{i know. i heard.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{well hear this: after you left the bar, mike pyle comes up to me pyle of shit, i call him and he asks do i want to sign this thing. and i go, "lemke might have been a class a deviant, but the guy was tits as a rep..."}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{pardon my french, dean, but that's a bunch of bull roar. my boss, bill krogstad? he told me how you called up joyce armbruster and smeared roger's name all over town...}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{joyce who...? oh, no no no, whoa whoa whoa, that old whore called me. harping about lemke being a pervert and how she wants to take her business elsewhere. so i says, "ok, i will run some numbers." well, she calls back later that same day, says she got krogstad to lower her premium. which is all the greasy twat wanted in the first place.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{so wait, you didn't call her?}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{i may be a lot of things, but poacher ain't one of `em.}
<A>__{tim lets this sink in. dean hiccups and burps again.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{so what's with this petition?}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{personally? i think mike pyle of shit started the thing as a way to drive down the price of your agency. dollars to donuts he wants to swoop in and pick up northlands at a bargain basement price. and you know what else i think? i think orin's in on the deal somehow.}
<A>__{what? that's impossible.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{what? that's impossible.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{i can't quite figure it myself, but i know what i know. and what i know is you're wading into some duvious, er dubious, shit. just be careful.}
<A>__{tim looks shell shocked. what a long, long day it's been.}
