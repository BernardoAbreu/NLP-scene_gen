<L>__{exterior strawberry fields day}
<A>__{children working fields in sunlight. kneeling in the rows. hatsue with a half dozen japanese girls, her hair loose, her face lightly sheened with sweat. she works with efficiency and grace, filling her flat. three rows away. ishmael watches. the fear not far beneath the surface of his quiet, dark features.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{by two weeks, i knew i had made the defining mistake of my life.}
<A>__{hatsue's gaze drifts slightly in this direction, and ishmael looks down rapidly at his work. cheeks burning, certain she is watching. which she is not.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{i'd ruined everything.}
<A>__{later...end of day. the young pickers turning in their flats as a gentle rain begins. hatsue counts her money, slips it into her pocket, and... ...runs lightly off, into the growing rain. ishmael sees. stricken to his soul with longing. and indecision.}
