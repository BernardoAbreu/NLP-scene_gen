<L>__{exterior theatre same}
<A>__{gale approaches the side theatre door. she pulls on it. it's locked.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{she moves down along the theatre to another door.}

<L>__{interior theatre a minute later}
<A>__{hallie and derek move around sid, taking turns filming her with the camera.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{we met on the internet.}
<C>__{hallie}
<D>__{he sent me the cutest e mail.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{i read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. hook, line...}
<C>__{hallie}
<D>__{we have our own website now. we dedicated a whole page to you.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{you'd me amazed at how many of us there are out there. it's a whole world, sid. you're really popular amongst the demented.}
<C>__{hallie}
<D>__{you're the one who got away.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{until now.}
<C>__{cotton}
<D>__{you guys are fucked.}
<C>__{hallie}
<D>__{actually cotton, and i think critics would agree, it's the other way around.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{poor cotton, could life be a little more cruel?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{you're not going to get away with this.}
<C>__{hallie}
<D>__{of course not. who wants to? what's the point if we don't get caught? where's the glamour in that?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{the way i see it. we'll be arrested. go to prison. cash in on the home footage. secure a book deal. if all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of stab ii.}
<C>__{hallie}
<D>__{a verdict and premiere all on the same day. i love it.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{we're hoping for the death penalty. i have this whole dead man walking swan song exit planned.}
<C>__{hallie}
<D>__{and now, drum roll please...}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{hope you're ready, sid. we got one last surprise for you.}
<A>__{cotton pull and twists on his bound wrists. sid had loosened them somewhat. he tries to finish undoing them.}
<C>__{hallie}
<D>__{a twist ending if you will.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. it really is the curse of the sequel. the billy stu thing's been done.}
<C>__{hallie}
<D>__{... so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{and we didn't want to do that, sid. we wanted to give you your money's worth.}
<C>__{hallie}
<D>__{so we found a compromise.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{or it found us.}
<C>__{hallie}
<D>__{we have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{just for you, sid.}
<C>__{hallie}
<D>__{wait a sec, derek. we forgot to flip.}
<A>__{derek reaches in his pocket for a coin.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{oh yeah.}
<P>__{(to sid)}
<D>__{we figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. it's been an ongoing discussion.}
<P>__{(to hallie)}
<D>__{heads or tails?}
<C>__{hallie}
<D>__{tails.}
<A>__{he flips the coin.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{shit! you win.}
<B>__{in the auditorium}
<A>__{gale emerges from the lobby. she found a way in. she eyes the proceedings on stage. she sees sidney standing over cotton. and then hallie and derek on either side... knives in hand. she races down the aisle.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{sidney!}
<B>__{on stage}
<A>__{they all turn, spotting gale. sid moves forward, happy to see her.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{gale!}
<B>__{in the auditorium}
<A>__{gale moves down the aisle, not sure what's going on.}
<B>__{on stage}
<A>__{sidney moves down center. derek cuts her off just as...}
<B>__{the curtain drops}
<A>__{gale glimpsed the terror on sidney's face just as the curtain separates them.}
<B>__{on stage}
<A>__{derek grabs sidney, holding her, the knife at her throat.}
<C>__{hallie}
