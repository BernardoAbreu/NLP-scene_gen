<D>__{now let's try to get out of here.}
<A>__{eric walks into the back office. the others look at each other. suddenly a black figure runs across the bank behind the shadows, francois sees it and nervously fires. in the background the distinctive sound of european police sirens wail as more cars pull up to the outside of the bank. also, an unintelligible voice is blaring orders over a bullhorn.}
<C>__{francois}
<D>__{[the police! they're entering the building!]}
<A>__{suddenly all of them start firing like blindly into the smoke. francois runs back to eric who has walked up to the elevator via the back office.}
