<A>__{quail smiles, presses the red button again. there is a humming sound and the man fades into thin air like a television set being turned off. quail looks bemused. now he unrolls the leather pouch and looks inside. there he finds what look like surgical instruments; a sponge, a long piece of wire doubled over, with some attachments and a tiny metal head on one end, and some tubes of salve. he turns on the cassette recorder. the voice he hears on the cassette tape is his own!}
