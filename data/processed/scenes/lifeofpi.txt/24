<A>__{it is raining outside. pan from the window; mother lies in bed with pi as they continue sharing this story for the thousandth time. mother's voice plays over (note: they speak in tamil throughout the following dialogue):}
<C>__{pi}
<D>__{...but he didn't!}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{that's what he told her. "i didn't eat dirt!" "no? well, then open your mouth." so krishna opened his mouth.}
<A>__{pi opens his mouth in imitation.}
<D>__{mother (tamil) (cont'd) and what do you think yashoda saw?}
<C>__{pi }
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mother }
<D>__{she saw in krishna's mouth the whole entire universe.}
<A>__{pi and ravi's bedroom, 1966 night pi has made a tent of his blanket, a flashlight glowing beneath the covers. in his tent, pi flips through the pages of a hindu comic book, enthralled by the story of krishna... the panels of the comic book show krishna's mouth falling open, revealing stars and planets, the universe unfolding in wondrous detail. pondi temple courtyard, 1966 night a tank ceremony is about to begin. the tank is a square reservoir the size of a soccer field; pi's family sits among the crowd on the steps that lead down to the water.}
<C>__{adult pi }
<D>__{the gods were my superheroes growing up. hanuman, the monkey god, lifting an entire mountain to save his friend lakshmana. ganesh, the elephantheaded, risking his life to defend the honor of his mother parvati. vishnu, the supreme soul, the source of all things. vishnu sleeps, floating on the shoreless cosmic ocean and we are the stuff of his dreaming.}
<C>__{father}
<P>__{(with quiet sincerity.)}
<D>__{spectacle. don't let the stories and pretty lights fool you, boys. religion is darkness.}
<C>__{adult pi }
<D>__{my dear 'appa' believed himself part of the 'new india.' as a child, he'd had polio; he used to lie in bed, wracked with pain, wondering where god was. in the end, god didn't save him; western medicine did.}
<A>__{below, mother watches the ceremony, lost in contemplation.}
<C>__{adult pi }
<D>__{my 'amma' went to college and thought her family was part of the 'new india' as well until her parents cut her off because they thought she was marrying beneath her. her religion was the only link she had to her past.}
