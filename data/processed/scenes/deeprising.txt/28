<A>__{crammed wall to wall with enough horsepower to fly a 747. pumped out of two thumping engines. the domain of a scruffy, shifty eyed, likeable little weasel of a mechanical genius...joey pantucci. wearing a mechanic's toolbelt, slung sideways across the hips like a gunslinger, singing the theme to "gilligan's island" over the engine's roar. way off key. his hands crammed deep in a tangle of wires. on the walls are a few pictures: of a few major league engines. of a few major league pinups, and a few of pantucci and finnegan...together in the u.s. navy...in front of the saipan in shinier days.}
