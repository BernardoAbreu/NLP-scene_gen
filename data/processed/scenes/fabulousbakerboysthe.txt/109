<L>__{exterior street}
<A>__{jack walks down the street, mindless of the rain. frank follows a few yards behind.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{jack. we just,passed the car. jack. this is a tuxedo. three hundred dollars.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you gonna talk to me? or is this jack's famous silent act? look, it was for publicity. do you understand? publicity.}
<A>__{jack stops and stares at frank incredulously.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what are you? a fucking moron? it's three o'clock in the morning, frank. who's watching? your wife? maybe you can get us a gig playing little frank's birthday party. what do you think?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{look. i didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday. what was i supposed to do? i had the pianos anyway.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{basketballs, frank. you had us playing for basketballs.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i should've checked it out. i screwed up. but that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it wasn't professional, jack. it was a stunt. a stupid ass stunt.}
<A>__{jack just stares at frank, as if looking at a stranger.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what's happening to you, frank? you been kissing ass so long you're starting to like it? you let that guy turn us into clowns tonight. we were always small time, but we were never clowns, frank. what's happened to your dignity?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{dignity? who the hell are you to talk about dignity?}
<A>__{frank suddenly steps forward and reaches into jack's jacket, coming away with a bottle.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{this where you get your dignity, jack? this is where you get your courage?}
<A>__{jack tries to grab the bottle but frank holds it away.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{no, let's do it straight for once, shall we?}
<A>__{frank tosses the bottle into the street, where it}
<B>__{shatters.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{let me explain something to you, little brother. see, i've got people who depend on me. i've got a wife and two children who expect to wake up every morning with food on the table and heat in the house. i got a mortgage. i got car payments. i got ma's medical bills. oh yeah, and i got you. yeah, you. jack the shadow who's so cool and so hip and so fucking sure he's better than everyone else. don't you think i'd like to walk up to one of these assholes and blow smoke in his face? goddamn right i would. but i can't. because i have to be responsible, little brother. i have to make sure the numbers balance out in my favor at the end of each month so everyone can go on living their lives. you don't win medals for it, but you can be damn sure you'd all take notice if i folded up shop. so don't talk to me about dignity, little brother. you're drawing on a weak hand.}
<A>__{jack stares at frank through the rain, then turns and begins to walk away.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{great. terrific. walk away. you're good at that, jack. just don't forget to stop off for another bottle of courage on your way home.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{that's what he'd do.}
<A>__{jack stops, his back to frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you've found the perfect solution to all the pain in the world, haven't you, little brother? eight fifty a bottle, available any time day or night at your friendly neighborhood liquor store. you're weak, jack. just like he was.}
<A>__{jack turns, tough and dangerous in the darkness.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{stay off it.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no, let's stay on it. i'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. for christ sake, jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig. he left a wife and two sons. he wasn't a hero. he was a fool.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(eerily cold)}
<D>__{you weren't there.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{that's right. i wasn't there. i don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(coiled)}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no, fuck you. and fuck him too. fuck the both of you.}
<A>__{jack suddenly bolts for,ward and grabs frank by the lapels.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{hey, what're you doing? hey!}
<A>__{jack flings frank against the wall, pounding, pulling and slamming him in a fitful rage.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing; scared)}
<D>__{jack! ... jack! ...}
<A>__{frank slides to the ground, afraid, trying to protect himself. jack hovers over him.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how's it feel to have your little brother beat the shit out of you? huh? huh!}
<A>__{jack comes down with a vicious fist at frank's face. frank holds up his hands, trying to shield himself, and catches a blow on his fingers.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{my hands! my hands!}
<A>__{jack grabs one of frank's hands.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(mocking)}
<D>__{your hands. your hands couldn't take the blue ribbon on amateur night.}
<A>__{jack bends back frank's fingers.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(terrified)}
<D>__{jack!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{who's weak now, big brother?}
<A>__{jack pushes frank's fingers until the knuckles crack.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{jack! jack!}
<A>__{frank's voice echoes high above the sound of the rain. suddenly jack stops. looking at frank's hand, still clasped in his, he seems as shocked by his own behavior as frank. letting go, he steps back awkwardly and looks at his brother, beaten, to the ground, his tuxedo ripped and dirty. he stares at his own hands, the knuckles split and bleeding. he no longer looks dangerous. he looks hollow, frightened.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm through with it. i can't do it anymore.}
<A>__{frank, rubbing his fingers, glances up at jack, but jack just turns away, leaving frank on the sidewalk, and disappears into the rain. music begins. a sad, plaintive solo piano. and we see:}
<B>__{series of shots}
<A>__{jack, crossing the street to his apartment, the rain over now. frank, driving home, his face swollen and bruised in the dim glow of the streetlights. jack, letting himself into his apartment and standing there. alone. frank, easing the car into the driveway, turning off the engine. jack, taking a bottle from the kitchen, moving numbly. frank, much later, still sitting in the driveway as the sun begins to come up. jack, sitting in the phone booth, the bottle in his hand.}
