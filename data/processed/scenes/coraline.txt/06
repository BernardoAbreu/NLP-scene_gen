<A>__{it's pouring out. coraline looks out a window at the dead looking garden, and places packets of seeds pumpkins, squash, snap dragons, bleeding hearts on the sill. she's developed a reddish rash poison oak on one hand. the main floor kitchen, like most things in the pink palace, is barely maintained, and looks worn and faded. coraline's mother, mel jones, 40, bangs away at her laptop on the table, moving boxes stacked nearby. she's plain looking and tired and wears a neck brace.}
