<A>__{the core of a rotten apple. the bowels of hell. drenched in shadow, josh fumbles forward into yet another corridor of this labyrinth. he realizes he knows where he is. he is in his old house. an alternate world version of it. the lighting is different it's darker. there are no signs of life. water drips somewhere. josh stumbles forward, seeing an open door.}

<A>__{josh slinks into a darkened and dilapidated living room. there are three people in here a middle aged woman, a middle aged man and a young girl. they are all frozen, standing in place as if someone had hit the pause button on their life. the woman is in the middle of ironing. the man is sitting in an arm chair reading a newspaper. the girl is lying on the floor. the whole scene looks like a macabre `leave it to beaver' tableau a cheerful family frozen in time. josh steps closer to the mother... ...hairs prickling up on his neck when he sees her blink. her body moves slightly. she is not frozen merely playing statues. like a street performer keeping as still as possible. josh turns to the father. he is the same. his hand shakes, struggling to hold the newspaper in place. he backs away from them, truly creeped out. his back hits a window and he turns, peering through the glass down at the street below. a figure, hidden in silhouette, is gazing up at him.}
