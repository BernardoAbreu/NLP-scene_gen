<A>__{they walk in the front door. the rat stands uncomfortably in the doorway to the living room.}
<C>__{the rat}
<D>__{where's your brother?}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{i don't know. probably out. want something to drink?}
<C>__{the rat}

<A>__{stacy turns her back and pulls up her hair.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{will you unzip me?}
<A>__{angle on the rat's face as the wheels inside his mind start to spin. this can't be what it seems. he unzips stacy, past her bra, down to the small of her back. it's the first time he's ever done anything like that.}
<C>__{stacy }
<D>__{thanks!}
<A>__{she walks down the hall to her room, easing out of her dress as she walks. she leaves the door to her room open.}
<C>__{stacy }
<D>__{you can come in, if you want!}
<A>__{angle on the rat's face he is completely unsure of himself, as he begins to walk down the hall. his heart pounds into his throat. he turns the corner and steps into stacy's room.}
