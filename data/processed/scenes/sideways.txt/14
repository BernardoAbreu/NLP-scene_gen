<L>__{interior saab continuous}
<A>__{in a rear view mirror the erganians wave good bye. inside the car miles accelerates as he and jack wave back.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{where the fuck were you, man? i was dying in there. we were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i can't help the traffic.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{come on. you're fucking hungover.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{okay, there was a tasting last night. but i wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. check out the box.}
<A>__{jack turns around, and starts rooting around in a cardboard}
<B>__{wine box.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{why did you tell them my book was being published?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you said you had it all lined up.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{no, i didn't. what i said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at conundrum...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah, conundrum.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. she was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... it's always like this. it's always a fucking waiting game. i've been through it too many times already.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i don't know. senior editor? sounds like you're in to me.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{it's a long shot, all right? and conundrum is just a small specialty press anyway. i'm not getting my hopes up. i've stopped caring. that's it. i've stopped caring.}
<A>__{jack sits back in his seat holding up a bottle of champagne and two glasses.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{but i know it's going to happen this time. i can feel it. this is the one. i'm proud of you, man. you're the smartest guy i know.}
<A>__{jack now begins to remove the foil from the champagne bottle.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{don't open that now. it's warm.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{come on, we're celebrating. i say we pop it.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{that's a 1992 byron. it's really rare. don't open it now. i've been saving it!}
<A>__{jack untwists the wire. instantly the cork pops off, and a fountain of champagne erupts.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{for christ's sake, jack! you just wasted like half of it!}
<A>__{jack begins pouring two glasses.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{shut up.}
<P>__{(handing miles a glass)}
<D>__{here's to a great week.}
<C>__{miles}
<P>__{(coming around)}
<D>__{yes. absolutely. despite your crass behavior, i'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{you know how long i've been begging to take you on the wine tour. i was beginning to think it was never going to happen.}
<A>__{they clink and drink.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh, that's tasty.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{100% pinot noir. single vineyard. they don't even make it anymore.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{pinot noir? how come it's white? doesn't noir mean dark?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{jesus. don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. they'll think you're a moron.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{just tell me.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{color in the red wines comes from the skins. this juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(not really listening)}
<D>__{sure is tasty.}
