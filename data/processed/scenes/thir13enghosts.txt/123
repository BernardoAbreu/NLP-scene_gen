<D>__{do something! help me save the kids!}
<A>__{the ghost raises his hand, pointing into the ocularis, motioning for arthur to jump in... and that will stop everything. a fourth inner ring flaps up, working its way closer to the center. the kids are freaking out. arthur looks from his kids, to the spinning rings, and back to cyrus again. he wrestles with what he should do... then his eyes land on jean. she looks so sad, staring at her hysterical kids, helpless. arthur's choice is made. he steps up to the ocularis, standing in front of the spinning gears. he prepares himself for what he's about to do.}
