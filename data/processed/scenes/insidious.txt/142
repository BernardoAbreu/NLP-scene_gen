<L>__{interior corridor, the further}
<A>__{josh is exhausted, pushing himself to the limits. he hears the voice again distant and small. an echo.}
<C>__{renai }
<D>__{find us...}
<A>__{josh follows the voice to a door. he staggers towards it, still supporting dalton. he slams the door open, falling through it into }
<L>__{interior basement, lambert home, the further}
<A>__{ the empty basement. he is in the basement of his old house. the wooden steps beckon above him. renai's voice cries out from behind the door at the top of the stairs.}
<C>__{renai }
<D>__{hurry! come back to us!}
<C>__{dalton}
<D>__{put me down, i can run!}
<A>__{josh sets dalton down, who scampers up the stairs. josh is about to follow when he turns and spies a familiar face.}
<B>__{the old woman.}
<A>__{she leers at josh through the window of the basement, her visage spookily flecked in candlelight. josh is transfixed.}
<C>__{dalton }
<D>__{come on, dad! come on!}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{go! i'm right behind you!}
<A>__{dalton charges ahead as josh glares back at this face from his past.}
<C>__{josh }
<D>__{you...what do you want from me?}
<A>__{the old woman's eerily unblinking gaze cuts through josh. a long dormant rage boils over inside him. he approaches the window, vomiting fury at her.}
<C>__{josh }
<D>__{get the fuck away from me! i'm not scared of you, just leave me alone! get away from me!}
<A>__{the old woman's lips protract to unveil a yellow graveyard of molars. a smile to buckle the steeliest nerve. she raises a lit candle to her lips. she snuffs out the plume with a single puff...plunging the basement into darkness.}
