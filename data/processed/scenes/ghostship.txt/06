<A>__{dodge and greer look on from the stern, where the boat's name "arctic warrior" is emblazoned on the transom. dodge (37), scruffy chief engineer, wearing de rigueur greasy coveralls and nicotine stained fingers, is an expatriate texan and former merchant marine. greer (42), is the boat's first mate, african american, originally from some sweltering red neck hellhole, now a tug pilot intentionally well to the north. they watch as epps pulls herself toward them, the cable occasionally dipping a few feet with a spray of water as a passing swell slackens it. epps pulls herself to the stern where the cable winds into a tow anchor.}
