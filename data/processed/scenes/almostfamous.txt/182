<T>__{fade out: fade up:}
<L>__{interior band plane day}
<A>__{russell and william are in mid interview. the kid's microphone is out. it's a little bit of a rough flight. william wears the same clothes.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{why didn't you come back to the party? bob dylan showed up. he was sitting at our table for... had to be an hour, right? just rapping.}
<A>__{bob dylan! i}
<D>__{kept looking for you. i was going to introduce you.}
<A>__{the kid feels pain.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{what happened to you last night?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{it's a log story.}
<A>__{a sharp jolt of turbulence. russell begins pounding on the card table in rhythm.}
<C>__{russell}
<P>__{(singing buddy holly)}
<D>__{"peggy sure... peggy sue... "}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{please.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{"pretty pretty pretty pretty peggy sue... "}
<A>__{a moment of laughter, and then bam. jeff's drink rises and suspends briefly in mid air. the plane takes another mighty knock.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{we shouldn't be here.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{doris, we miss you!}
<A>__{fear is creeping in around the edges. william, already an uneasy flier, looks down.}
<C>__{pilot's voice}
<D>__{this is craig, your pilot. it appears we've caught the edge of that electrical storm we were trying to outrun. buckle up tight now. we're gonna do our best to getcha out of this.}
<A>__{the rocking of the plane worsens, as all buckle up.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{"electrical storm?"}
<C>__{russell}
<P>__{(strapping in for a roller coaster)}
<D>__{rock and roll.}
<A>__{the sky darkens abruptly. william looks up, increasingly nervous, stares straight ahead. the plane suddenly drops and stabilizes. everyone is silent but russell.}
<C>__{russell }
<D>__{wooooooo baby!}
<A>__{a moment later, an ashen faced co pilot emerges, balancing himself with hands on the ceiling of the shuddering plane.}
<D>__{co pilot we're gonna try to land in tupelo. we're going to have to cut the inside lighting for the next several minutes. we found a field to land in.}
<A>__{the kid notices silent ed is rubbing a small crucifix.}
<C>__{dennis hope}
<D>__{a field?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i can't breathe.}
<A>__{push in on russell. we hear a series of unfamiliar electrical sounds. the plane screwballs through the sky.}
<D>__{co pilot it might be a rough set down. we should be fine.}
<P>__{(cracking at the edges)}
<D>__{but what we do say in a situation like this is we would pass but before the plane ... disassembled. however, god help us, if there's anything you want to say to each other, any secrets, anything like that, now would be a good time. but just hang in there. we'll get you out of this.}
<A>__{he returns to the cockpit. the weather worsens, as the hail suddenly pelts the plane, and it comes down hard. inside lights shut off. william stares straight ahead, as the cockpit door swings open total chaos visible inside and then shuts again.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{and everyone thinks it's so glamorous out here.}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(oddly detached)}
<D>__{he just told us we're gonna die.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(insecurities running wild)}
<D>__{we're gonna crash in elvis' hometown }
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{shut up.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{ we can't even die in an original city!}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{c'mon dennis, get us a better city.}
<A>__{nervous laughter. another sheet of hail hits the plane.}
<C>__{leslie}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<B>__{push in on william}
<A>__{just shaking. nearly in tears. hyperventilating.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{if something should happen. i love all of you. i don't think we have to do the secrets thing.}
<A>__{the plane shakes. now lightening strikes very close. a flashing wall of electricity rolls through the plane and evaporates with a burning smell still in the air. in the darkness:}
<C>__{dennis hope}
<D>__{i once hit a man in dearborn, michigan. a hit and run. i hit him and kept on going. i don't know if he's alive or dead, but i'm sorry.}
<C>__{leslie}
<P>__{(gripped with fear) oh my god.}
<A>__{the plane wildly rises, and falls. it stops for a moment. a strange smooth patch.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{i love you all too, and you're my family. especially since marna left me. but if i ever took an extra dollar or two, here and there, it was because i knew i'd earned it.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{i slept with marna, dick.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i did too.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i waited until you broke up with her. but me too.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i also slept with leslie, when you were fighting.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{you... slept with jeff?}
<C>__{leslie}
<D>__{yes, but it didn't count. it was the summer we decided to be free of all rules.}
<C>__{russell}
<P>__{(to jeff)}
<D>__{and you say you "love me."}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(the truth)}
<D>__{i don't love you, man. i never did.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{please. enough.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{none of us love you. you act above us. you always have!!}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{finally. the truth.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{you just held it over us, like you light leave... like we're lucky to be with you. and we had to live with it. i had to live with you, and now i might die with you and it's not fucking fair.}
<A>__{william watches, catatonic.}
<C>__{russell}
<P>__{(to larry and ed)}
<D>__{you hate me? you too?}
<A>__{larry stares at him. ed says nothing.}
<C>__{russell }
<D>__{all this love.}
<A>__{all this loyalty.}
<P>__{(incredulous, giddy)}
<D>__{and you don't even like me.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{and i'm still in love with you leslie.}
<A>__{bam. the plane is pulling sideways, and dropping altitude.}
<C>__{leslie}
<D>__{i don't want to hear anymore. shut up! shut up! shut up!}
<C>__{russell}
<P>__{(to jeff) whatever happens, you're dead.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{don't be self righteous, russell, not now. you were sleeping with penny, that groupie. last summer, and up until yesterday.}
<A>__{why don't you tell}
<D>__{leslie that?}
<A>__{russell tries to get up and attack him. the force keeps him in his seat. he yells. loud.}
<C>__{dennis}
<P>__{(freaking out)}
<D>__{i quit.}
<A>__{the turbulence worsens. william finds his mouth saying emotional words he cannot control.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{"that groupie?" she was a band aid. all she did was love your band. and you all you used her, all of you. you used her and threw her away. she almost died last night, while you were with bob dylan.}
<A>__{you're always talking}
<D>__{about the fans, the fans, the fans. she was your biggest fan and you threw her away. and if you can't see that, that's your biggest problem.}
<A>__{russell and jeff stare at each other. the plane is rocking very very hard. leslie is crying.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{i'm gay.}
<A>__{they all turn to the silent drummer. (it's his first spoken dialogue of the movie.) then. the plane pops out from below the clouds. sunshine spikes through the embattled windows of the plane, as they float downwards to the city of tupelo, mississippi. a very very uneasy silence fills the plane. no one can look at each other. out bursts the co pilot, giddy with victory.}
<D>__{co pilot thank god above, we're alive!! we're alive!! we're gonna make it!!}
<A>__{shot of all the occupants, ending with russell. suddenly, the alternative seems far more attractive. we hear rod stewart's "jo's lament" as music plays over their still shocked faces.}
