<L>__{exterior kettle high campus day}
<A>__{two girls are hanging an homemade banner on the fence surrounding the football field. it says "turnabout dance october 5 tickets on sale." needy walks briskly toward school, huddled in her parka. she looks totally fucked up, like she hasn't slept in days. there are hollows beneath her eyes.}
<C>__{needy v.o.}
<D>__{they did a big memorial assembly for colin at school, and we had to watch another presentation about curfews and the buddy system and how to deal with grief. but nobody seemed to care anymore. sorrow was last week's emotion.}
<A>__{we see jennifer a few yards away, talking and laughing with some other flag team members.}
<C>__{needy v.o. }
<D>__{jennifer and i hadn't spoken since our encounter in my room. actually, i hadn't really spoken to anyone. i was busy with research. paranormal research.}
<A>__{needy gazes off into the distance with bloodshot eyes. as she stares at jennifer, she see has a series of brief, gruesome hallucinations: jennifer as a grinning death mask. jennifer as a corpse, the lower half of her face rotted away. jennifer as a harlequin monster. needy hears the rush of her own blood, the barely audible buzzing of flies... chip jogs up next to her, jolting her out of her reverie.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{hey. did you buy turnabout tickets yet? i don't get paid until next week.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{i gotta show you something.}

<P>__{(wearily)}
<D>__{is this about jennifer?}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{yes, but i promise you this is the last thing i need to show y }
<C>__{chip}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{needy, i care about you. a lot. as a person, not just a girl i made love to for four minutes the other night. and i'm scared of what's happening to you. you're acting really fucked up.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{please just let me show you.}
<A>__{her gaze is so intense and crazed that chip has no option but to submit. he nods reluctantly.}
