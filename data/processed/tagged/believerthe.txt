<L>__{interior yeshiva classroom day}
<A>__{a run down place. a dozen 12 year old boys sit at old fashioned desks. these are not hasidim, but orthodox jews: normal american kids in yarmulkes. the teacher, rav zingesser is young, overweight, acnescarred, good humored.}
<C>__{rav zingesser}
<D>__{and why did the holy one blessed be he do this? why did he ask abraham to sacrifice his only son, whom he loved?}
<A>__{two boys off to one side: avi (a smart, tough, brownnose) and danny (the eternal dissident) argue under their breath....}
<D>__{12 year old danny isaac wasn't his only son. ishmael was his son, too. 12 year old avi the only son he loved. 12 year old danny oh, they only kill them when they love them...? 12 year old stuart}
<P>__{(up front; answering zingesser)}
<D>__{it was a test of abraham's faith. of his devotion to god. 12 year old danny it's not about abraham's faith. it's about god's power. god says, "you know how powerful i am? i can make you do anything i want, no matter how stupid. even kill your own son. because i'm everything, you're nothing."}
<A>__{titters. danny looks around at his classmates: nerds, wankers, nose pickers. two kids in back furtively read the racing form under their desks. he hates them for their indifference as much as he despises stuart's piety or avi's ass kissing.}
<C>__{rav zingesser}
<D>__{but, danny, if hashem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge his actions? 12 year old danny we have free will and intelligence which god allegedly gave us....}
<C>__{avi}
<D>__{anyway, god never lets abraham kill isaac. he provides the ram so that 12 year old danny personally, i think that's a lie. i think he did kill him.}
<C>__{rav zingesser}
<D>__{you think?! based on what? 12 year old danny there's midrash supporting this. my father read a book by shalom spiegel that isaac actually died and was reborn.}
<C>__{rav zingesser}
<D>__{no one follows that midrash. 12 year old danny i do; i follow it. but okay, say god provided the ram. so what? once abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. he could never forget that. and neither could isaac. look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. by the end he can't tell jacob from esau....}
<A>__{the kids laugh. zingesser cracks a ruler against a desk.}
<C>__{rav zingesser}
<D>__{watch your language.... 12 year old danny}
<P>__{(rising impassioned)}
<D>__{i think the whole jewish people were permanently scarred by what happened on mt. moriah, and we still live in terror.... 12 year old stuart fear of god is the beginning of wisdom. 12 year old danny fear of god makes you afraid of everything. all the jews are good at is being afraid. and being sacrificed.}
<A>__{oooo. crack, crack, crack. even the guys with the sports pages are shocked by that one.}
<D>__{12 year old stuart don't you believe in god? 12 year old danny i'm the only one here who does believe. you say he's mysterious, yet merciful. i see him for the power drunk madman he is. and we're supposed to worship such a deity?? i say never! i say...fight him. i say }
<A>__{the ruler has been cracking from "power drunk" on.... now zingesser grabs danny, yanks him out of his chair.}

<D>__{and you, if you had come out of egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the golden calf. 12 year old danny then let him destroy me now. let him crush me like the conceited bully he is.}

<L>__{interior 7 train 1998 day}
<A>__{title: 13 years later the train passes above used car lots, discount furniture stores, residential side streets...finally pulls into a station. the doors open. people file on, the camera letting them go by until it spots a tall, thin college student in a yarmulke. danny grown up? pan with him as he sits, opens an organic chemistry texterior the doors close. the train starts up, but the jewish boy hardly notices; he is already reading. he sways with the motion of the car, half hidden by other passengers. we realize he is being watched. reverse angle: another young man, standing a "suede head" (his hair cut so short it's like a fine fabric). suede head's pov: the jewish boy pushes his glasses back up his nose, wipes the nose with a handkerchief, puts the handkerchief away, and all the time his eyes have not left the page. suede head steps between passengers and stands directly over the jewish boy. he looks down at the yarmulke pinned to the stiff, wavy hair, at the oversized shirt collar, scrawny neck, prominent adam's apple, pimples, dandruff, ingrown facial hair... he steps closer, crowding the boy's knees. the boy shifts a little without looking up. subtly but relentlessly, suede head pursues him along the bench until, unable to slide farther, the boy flattens his legs against the seat. suede head presses into the boy's knees. the boy accidentally bumps a businessman to suede head's left. the man (late 30s, wall street journal, african american) looks from the boy to suede head and understands at once what is going on. suede head stares right back and the businessman returns to his paper. suede head eases him aside and steps on the boy's shoe. shoes a heavy black boot pins a brown wingtip to the floor the wingtip wiggles back and forth, finally working free. the boy still hasn't looked up. suede head & the jewish boy swaying, locked in a strange, silent intimacy. suede head forces the boy into ever more contorted postures, increasingly ridiculous denials of what is happening. and the boy not only never stops reading the chemistry text, he keeps highlighting relevant passages. the train slows. the boy closes the book, caps the highlighter, gathers his things and manages to stand up, wriggling awkwardly around suede head. the doors open, he gets off.}
<L>__{interior station day}
<A>__{looking up a long escalator, the jewish boy riding down toward us. suede head arrives on the run at the top, races down a flight of stairs, vaults the bannister, slides down a metal slope.... lands on his feet and comes to stand at the foot of the escalator. the boy rides inexorably down. at the bottom, he tries to go around suede head who blocks this way, then another, driving him into a corner. the boy realizes he has nowhere to go finally turns to face his tormentor. their eyes meet for the first time. he is actually bigger than suede head, but not nearly as strong. he won't fight, is simply acknowledging what he can no longer deny. there is even an odd relief that disgusts suede head more than all the rest.}
<D>__{suede head fucking kike.}
<A>__{he slaps him in the face. he stumbles backward. as suede head goes to hit him again, the boy holds his books in front of him. suede head punches the books straight into his face. the boy falls, curls into a fetal position. suede head kicks him....}
<D>__{suede head get up.... get the fuck up....}
<A>__{he won't budge. suede head punches him repeatedly until he hears voices approaching. he runs back up the stairs to the train and only as we follow him do we realize that he is our protagonist. this is danny grown up.}

<D>__{yes. it's very pleasurable. but the jews are obsessed with it. you know why?}

<D>__{let's just say i've done due diligence.}

<C>__{danny}
<D>__{the jews clearly control the media and the banks. investment banks, not the commercial ones. but the point is they carry out in those realms the same principles they display in sexuality. they undermine traditional life; they deracinate society.}
<A>__{danny leans over to make sure guy's getting it right.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{deracinate... tear out the roots. a people a real people derives its genius from the land: the sun, the sea, the soil. this is how they know themselves. but the jew doesn't have soil.}

<D>__{those aren't jews.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{of course they're jews.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{notice the israelis: a fundamentally secular society. they no longer need judaism because they have soil. the real jew is a wanderer, a nomad. he has no roots, no attachments. so he "universalizes" everything. he can't hammer a nail, plow a field. he can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. he takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. this is his strength....}
<P>__{(pumped; this is what he loves)}
<D>__{take the great jewish minds: marx, freud, einstein. what have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. in a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. why? because it is the deepest impulse of the jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. nothingness without end...}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{are all jews the same?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{differences exist, of course, but they're irrelevant. for the jew, his jewishness dominates everything. even the ones who renounce it, who hate it, who want to cut it out of their hearts a knife...can't escape. they're still just jews.}

<D>__{drake! up here...}
<A>__{everyone turns, including drake who's blinded by the blood in his eyes, but recognizes the voice.}
<C>__{enraged man}
<D>__{see, he knows him. the nazi bastard...}
<A>__{drake moves unsteadily toward the front, pulling the girl with him. a woman (a doctor) goes to tend avi, who is still conscious. people begin to slip out the back, taking children. others stay, looking to jump drake, but he keeps the .357 on the little girl.}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(to carla, miriam, stuart)}
<D>__{get everybody out of here. fast.}

<C>__{danny}
<D>__{drake, i'm right here....}
<A>__{drake looks. danny reaches out a hand. drake points the .357 at him and fires, missing. a hand grabs the little girl, pulls her to safety. the room is nearly empty now, save miriam, carla, stuart, a few others. the avinu malkenu can still be heard from the hall....}
<C>__{enraged man}
<P>__{(from the door)}

<D>__{danny, good to see you...i wanted to take up that discussion we were having...}
