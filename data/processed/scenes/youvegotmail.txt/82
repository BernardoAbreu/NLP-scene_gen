<A>__{we see kathleen and george at the end of the day, counting the receipts. birdie is using a calculator to total them. christina is shelving books. there are thanksgiving decorations cardboard turkeys and pilgrims, books on colonists like myles standish.}
<P>__{kathleen (v.o., cont'd)}
<D>__{... and thrilling about this island in cyberspace i have with you. so please don't ask me again.}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{about $1200 less than the same week last year.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{that could be a fluke, right?}
<A>__{they look at each other.}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{or not.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{their store is new. it's a novelty. but it will all shake out. do you think i should put up more twinkle lights?}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{that's a lovely idea.}
<C>__{christina}
<D>__{what if we have to fold? i will never find another part time job and i won't be able to pay the rent and i will have to move to brooklyn.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{the joy of rent control. six room for $450 a month.}
<C>__{christina}
<D>__{we know. you've told us a million times. i can't believe you're bringing it up at a time like this. it's like bragging because you're tall. birdie never brags about her rent and she pays even less than you.}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{ten rooms. i just rattle around from one to the other.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{hey, guys. we are not going to fold.}
<A>__{the door opens, and meredith carter, the woman george had swooned over in front of his building, walks in. george stares, frozen in place, as she walks up to him.}
<C>__{meredith}
<D>__{george pappas?}

<D>__{detective carter, 23rd precinct. i'd like to ask you a few questions.}
<A>__{kathleen suddenly sees george, following meredith out of the store. he's in a complete daze.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{george? where are you going?}
<A>__{he goes out the door. laura margulies, a well known children's book author, enters as george leaves.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{kathleen, are you surviving?}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{laura! we're so excited about your new book. when should we schedule your signing?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{oh, it's being published in january. are you going to be in business in january? i'm so worried.}
<C>__{kathleen}
<D>__{we're doing great, aren't we?}
<C>__{christina}
<D>__{great.}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{no difference whatsoever.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{thank god. well, you know you can count on me. for anything, support, rallies. picket lines. we can get the times to write something. or that nut in the independent }
