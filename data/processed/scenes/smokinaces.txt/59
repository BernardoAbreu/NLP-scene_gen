<L>__{interior pool hall bar}
<A>__{the boys have retired to the bar for a round of dollar drafts.}
<C>__{elmore}
<D>__{i think it's idiotic to continue this conversation.}
<P>__{(turns, to deeks)}
<D>__{we're ex cops which means we weren't great cops or even good ones.}
<C>__{deeks}
<D>__{paying bills with bullshit casino jobs, sitting watch on slot machines.}
<C>__{elmore}
<D>__{which was a great gig until we we walked in here and started drinking.}
<C>__{dupree}
<D>__{the bond on israel expires in eighteen hours, after that, it's a jump ball. our window is now.}
<C>__{deeks}
<D>__{who posted his bail?}
<A>__{dupree pats himself down, searching for his cigs.}
<C>__{dupree}
<D>__{his law firm, same one that hired me. israel walked out after he made bail and nobody's seen him since.}
<C>__{elmore}
<D>__{jack, if the rumors hold and israel is really the great white whale of snitches, then the mob is looking to put all kinds of bullets into his ass and pour some serious psychotics into the mix to do just that. so what real incentive is there to track him on something as small time as a skip trace, when it's putting you and yours in the path of severe pain and suffering and an almost certain prelude to doom.}
<A>__{a beat. dupree blows smoke, flicks ash.}
<C>__{dupree}
<D>__{so i guess you're not going.}
<C>__{elmore}
<D>__{shit, if you're on a crazy jag, why stop there, why not take fort knox with a fucking slingshot or go into hell after hitler...i like your chances a lot more.}
<A>__{dupree, stubbing his cigarette.}
<C>__{dupree}
<D>__{i know his location, we've got the drop of a maybe half a day before that location gets grape vined and the rest of the world gets hipped.}
<C>__{elmore}
<D>__{that's already happened hoss. it's naive to think otherwise.}
<C>__{deeks}
<D>__{where is he?}
<C>__{wyman }
<D>__{ lake tahoe.}
