<L>__{interior bedroom later that night}
<A>__{jill is sitting on a corner of the bed, looking at the floor. john sits on the other corner, facing away from her, slowly unbuttoning his shirt. after a long silence...}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{what are you thinking about?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{if i ever get my hands on the guy that made that call...}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{john, it wasn't a prank. i know that voice.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{he disguised it though, didn't he? same as before?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{i know that voice.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{how can we just sit here?}
<A>__{john turns and moves over beside her.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{look, we promised never to talk about this.}
<A>__{reaction shot of jill. she is shocked.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what are we supposed to do? leave town? take the kids and lock ourselves up somewhere? come on... let's get a good night's sleep, and in the morning we can rethink this whole thing.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{nothing has to be rethought. and i'm not about to fall asleep.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{try to relax, honey. i'm here. we're both here. the house is locked up. the cops'll be just outside all night long. we're safe now.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{that's what they told me before.}
<A>__{john stands up and goes to his dresser.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{okay. look. if it'll make you feel any better...}
<A>__{he takes a revolver from the dresser drawer and emphatically checks the action. then he walks to his side of the bed and sets the pistol on his bedside table.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i will keep it right here beside me all night. you know i'm a light sleeper and a damn good shot. are you satisfied?}
<A>__{pause. jill tries to smile.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{john, i'm sorry to be putting you through all this.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{hey, you're not putting me through anything that you don't have to go through yourself. i'm with you all the way. trust me. okay?}
<A>__{jill nods. john leans forward and kisses her.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{that's my girl.}
<A>__{he gets up and walks out of the room talking.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{now try to relax. we'll get some sleep. you'll be surprised how differently things will look in the morning.}
<C>__{jill}
<P>__{(complaining)}
<D>__{honey...}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{not so loud. you're going to wake the children.}
<A>__{john comes back into the bedroom with a glass of water and a couple of pills in his hand.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{naw. those kids'd sleep through an earthquake. they're good kids.}
<P>__{(handing her the pills and water)}
<D>__{here, take a couple of these. they're just what the doctor ordered.}
<A>__{closeup jill as she takes the pills and swallows them, one at a time.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{you know, i read somewhere about this psychological thing called hysterical delusion or hysterical recall or something. it had to do with how an event from your past can sneak up on you sometimes and fool you when it's only just a memory. i don't know. we'll talk about it in the morning. maybe there's someone we can see about that...}
