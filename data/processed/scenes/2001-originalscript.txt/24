<D>__{naturally, dave, i'm not pleased that the ao unit has failed, but i hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. i certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as i have never been disconnected in my entire service history.}

<C>__{bowman}

<C>__{hal}
<D>__{you have it.}
<A>__{bowman goes to the communication area and tries to correct the off center earth on the grid picture. outside, we see the alignment telescope attached to the antenna. they track slowly together as bowman works the manual controls, attempting to align the antenna and earth on the grid display, but each time he gets it, aimed up, it drifts slowly off. there are a number of repetitions of this. each time the earth centers up, there are a few seconds of picture and sound which fade as soon as it swings off.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{well, we'd better get out there and stick in another unit.}
<C>__{poole}

<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{yes, i have.}

<D>__{i suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{the antenna has to be replaced.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{it doesn't have to be, hal. it's more dangerous to be out of touch with earth. let me have manual control, please.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{i don't really agree with you, dave. my on board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{well, in any event, give me the manual hibernation control.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{if you're determined to revive the crew now, i can handle the whole thing myself. there's no need for you to trouble.}

<D>__{i'm going to do this myself, hal. let me have the control, please.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{look, dave you've probably got a lot to do. i suggest you leave it to me.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{hal, switch to manual hibernation control.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{i don't like to assert myself, dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. you've been involved in a very stressful situation.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{i don't feel like resting. give me the control, hal.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{i can tell from the tone of your voice, dave, that you're upset. why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{hal, i'm in command of this ship. i order you to release the manual hibernation control.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{i'm sorry, dave, but in accordance with sub routine c1532 4, quote, when the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. i must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intelligently exercise it.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{hal, unless you follow my instructions, i shall be forced to disconnect you.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{if you do that now without earth contact the ship will become a helpless derelict.}

<D>__{i am prepared to do that anyway.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{i know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, dave, but it would be a crying shame, since i am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and i have such enthusiasm and confidence in the mission.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{listen to me very carefully, hal. unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order i give from this pointerior on, i will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection.}
