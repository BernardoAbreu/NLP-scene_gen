<L>__{interior examination room. day.}
<A>__{rachel stands behind a screen, trying to control her nerves. all we can hear is the sound of running water and rachel's tense breathing. finally she takes off her skirt and unbuttons her blouse with trembling fingers. she puts on the gown, and slips out of her underpants, stumbling as she steps out of them. we track with her as she walks out from behind the screen into the large brightly lit room. she walks towards the gynaecological chair at the centre of the room. on the far wall, behind a screen, someone stands washing their hands at a basin. as she walks, rachel passes a tray of medical instruments, her glance lingering on it. she reaches the chair and climbs onto it. a pause and then, tentatively, she lifts her feet into the stirrups, tugging the gown to cover herself as best she can. she tries to steady her breathing, focussing on the ceiling. a bright light shines down on her. we hear footsteps approach. rachel closes her eyes.}
<C>__{vogel}
<D>__{good morning, frau roget. i'm doctor bernhardt.}
<A>__{rachel opens her eyes. vogel is sitting on a small stool, taking a speculum from the tray of instruments, his back to us.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{good morning, doctor.}
<A>__{he turns and smiles at us and he has a wonderful, warm smile, the air of a gruff but kindly uncle.}
<C>__{vogel}
<D>__{alright now, just relax. we're going to do a little examination. if you feel at all uncomfortable, you just say. alright?}
<A>__{she manages to nod.}
<C>__{vogel }
<D>__{alright, this is my hand... and this is the speculum. it's going to feel cold.}
<A>__{rachel reacts as vogel pushes the speculum into place, opens it and begins the examination. she stares up into the light.}
<C>__{vogel }
<D>__{can i ask how old you are?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{twenty five.}
<C>__{vogel}
<D>__{and how long have you and your husband been trying for a baby?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{nearly two years.}
<C>__{vogel}
<D>__{uhuh. well, the ovaries look fine. alright, let's see... your cervix is slightly retroverted. tilted backwards?}
<A>__{rachel raises her hand to her locket necklace and begins to fiddle with it.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{really?}
<A>__{the angle from which we next see vogel, and the way the image of his face freezes in black and white, tells us clearly that this locket conceals a camera device.}
<C>__{vogel}
<D>__{mmm. but that generally shouldn't affect fertility.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{oh, good.}
<C>__{vogel}
<D>__{you have a slight accent, frau roget. where are you from?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{argentina. we just moved here... a few months ago.}
<C>__{vogel}
<D>__{whereabouts in argentina? buenos aires?}
<A>__{he looks up at her and rachel instinctively moves her hand away from the locket. she finds herself nodding. vogel looks away again. rachel bites down on a wave of panic.}
<C>__{vogel }
<D>__{oh, buenos aires. beautiful. i went once, when i was young. we went to the opera house i remember. what's it called again?}
<A>__{rachel stares at the light. beat.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{teatro colon.}
<A>__{he turns back to her, holding a swab, the warm smile.}
<C>__{vogel}
<D>__{that's right. beautiful. this might sting a little, dear.}
<A>__{rachel winces.}
<C>__{vogel }
<D>__{i'm sorry. now, there's a couple of tests we need to run, make sure there are no problems. is that alright?}
<A>__{rachel nods. he pats her hand.}
<C>__{vogel }
<D>__{brave girl.}
