<L>__{interior subway tunnel that moment}
<A>__{broken concrete slabs rain down on a subway car stalled in the tunnel directly beneath broad avenue. support girders groan and give way as the street itself collapses and the front end of the tank drops through, crushing the subway train beneath it!}
<L>__{exterior broad avenue that moment night}
<A>__{the rear end of the tank projects out through the rubble. a hatch pops open. the joker crawls out through the smoke and pulls himself up to the street. he's down to his last three goons. he points to the batwing: bent, broken, wedged on its side in the asphalt seam running up broad avenue half in, half out of the tunnel.}
<C>__{joker}
<D>__{you do him. i'm outta here.}
<A>__{the goons look on in dismay as the joker scurries off. they sidestep blackened debris and move up cautiously on the batwing. through the cockpit dome they can see batman... inert in his harness, beaten to a pulp, all but dead. a jet of flame drives them back momentarily. they reach for their guns, move in warily...}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{yo.}
<A>__{the frightened goons turn in unison. an abrupt flurry of motion feet and fists flying quick flashes of red and green and three goons lie paralyzed on the street. the only one left standing is a fifteen year old boy garbed in a red and green aerialist's uniform... dick grayson.}
