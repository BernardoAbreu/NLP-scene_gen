<L>__{exterior arhat hut same evening}
<B>__{drew comes out of the hut and walks around to the area behind the}
<A>__{hut, high up on the mountain. the view is incredible. drew stands looking at the view, and slowly becomes aware of a figure sitting on the ground near him. he looks down, and it is the arhat!}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{master! i apologize, i did not see you.}
<A>__{the arhat says nothing, but just puts out his hand for the scroll. drew bows again, and gets down on his knees.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{i failed, master. a person was in danger...}
<A>__{the arhat holds up his hand, and drew stops talking.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{of course, you're right. no excuses...}
<A>__{drew bows once more and is ready to leave. the arhat reaches into his robes and pulls out the embroidered box that drew was given at the temple.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{you have it? how?}
<A>__{the arhat holds up the box in front of drew for a moment, then tears it in two with his hands, scattering the pieces to the winds.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{so, i didn't fail, huh?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i can ask my question, then?}
<A>__{the arhat sits without moving or speaking. drew takes that as a yes.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{what is the meaning of life?}
<A>__{the arhat ponders that for a moment, then smiles and puts his sandles on his head and stands up.}
<C>__{arhat}
<D>__{what is life? what is reality? the head of a dead cat.}
<A>__{he walks off, leaving drew sitting there, dumbstruck by the answer.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(smiling ruefully)}
<D>__{i just climbed a mountain to ask a loon about the meaning of life.}
<A>__{he shakes his head and gets up, following the arhat. the arhat is standing on the other side of his hut, the sandles still on his head.}
<C>__{arhat}
<D>__{for forty years, shaolin disciples have made their quest to deliver a scroll to me. you are not chinese.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{no. american.}
<C>__{arhat}
<D>__{i notice the littlest details.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{how many succeeded?}
<C>__{arhat}
<D>__{a handful. you chose correctly. nothing is more precious than human life.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{but, i didn't obey.}
<C>__{arhat}
<P>__{(smiling slightly)}
<D>__{at the beginning of your training, you were to obey without question. now, as you become a shaolin, you must learn to question everything, and obey yourself.}
<A>__{drew and the monk bow to each other, the sunset over the mountain in the b.g.}
