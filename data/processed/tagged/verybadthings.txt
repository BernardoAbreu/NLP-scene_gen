"here shelmer," my dad cries. he's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "here girl." this dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. she walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. shelmer rejected the "pup corn." fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. not one dog ate pup corn. not one. three months later, "pup corn" shuts down. chapter eleven. my father never got over it. never.}
