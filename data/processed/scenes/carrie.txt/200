<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior carrie's room night}
<A>__{carrie sits in front of that same mirror, but this time, there's a different attitude. and a different girl, which pleases her. she looks different, very different, from before. she's dressed in her lush red crushed velvet prom dress, but the shot is angled in such a way that we don't see it. in any case, it is not prim. she is wearing some makeup. she looks... well, there has been a transformation. in the background, the door is opened by margaret.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{come in, momma.}
<A>__{margaret advances into the room. carrie opens a florist box and takes out a lovely corsage of tiny tea roses.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{do you want to pin it on, momma?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{i can see your dirtypillows. everyone will.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{breasts, momma, breasts. every woman has them.}
<A>__{carrie's voice is calm; nothing, not even margaret, will spoil tonight, and ever so slightly, this scene and all that follow for a considerable period of time has an edge of unreality to it. it's all been diffused a bit a fairy tale through carrie's eyes. what would look bad or tacky looks acceptable; what looked good before now looks spectacular.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{take off that dress.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{we'll burn it together, we'll pray for forgiveness.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{no, momma.}
<A>__{the black forest cuckoo clock sings out downstairs. it's eight o'clock.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{he's not coming.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{stop it, momma. i'm nervous enough.}
<A>__{margaret reaches up and pinches her cheek hard, leaving a red mark. she looks toward carrie. carrie is pinning the tea roses on herself. margaret hooks her right hand into a claw, rips at her cheek, leaving a thin line of blood.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{stop hurting yourself, momma. that's not going to stop me either.}
<A>__{margaret strikes herself in the mouth with her fist.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{go away, momma.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{you know i'm right. he'll laugh at you. they'll all laugh at you.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{no. it'll be okay.}
<A>__{bur she's rattled, and nervously starts moving around a series of objects in the room. cosmetics on the bureau, the florist box, the glow in the dark statue. but it's sheer will at this pointerior it's after eight, and there's no sign of tommy.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{it's not too late. you can stay here with me.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{i will answer the door and say you're sick, i will say}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{momma, sit on the bed.}
<A>__{flex. margaret is pushed back on the bed. horrified, she rises again.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{i will say that you changed your mind, i will say}
<A>__{flex. margaret is thrust back on the bed.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{`thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.'}
<A>__{the words stop. but margaret's eyes are fixed on carrie, as carrie leans toward her. carrie's voice is soft and compassionate.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{you'll say nothing, momma. you are going to have to learn that i'm not like you, not anymore.}
<A>__{the buzzer downstairs sounds. carrie goes to her window and sees:}
