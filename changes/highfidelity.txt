A middleweight.  Not the smartest guy in the world, but certainly not the dumbest.  I've read books like The Unbearable Lightness of Being, Angela's Ashes, and Love in the Time of Cholera, and understood them, I think -- they're about girls, right? -- just kidding -- but I don't like them very much.  My all time top five favorite books are Johnny Cash's autobiography, Snow Crash by Neil Stevenson, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, The Trouser Press Guides to Rock, and, I don't know, probably something by Kurt Vonnegut.  I look through the New Yorker when my neighbor's done with it, and I'm not averse to going down to the Fine Arts to watch subtitles films, although on the whole I prefer American films.  Top five being Blade Runner, Cool Hand Luke, the first two Godfathers which we'll count as one, Taxi Driver, and The Shining. I'm okay looking, average height, not skinny, not fat.  My genius, if I can call it that, is to combine a whole load of averageness into one compact frame.  You might say there were millions like me, but there aren't, really: Alot of guys have impeccable music taste but don't read, alot of guys read but are really fat, alot of guys are sympathetic to women but have stupid beards, alot of guys have a Woody Allen sense of humor but look like Woody Allen. Some drink too much, some drive like assholes, some get into fights, or show off money, or do drugs.  I don't do any of these things, really.  If I do okay with women it's not because of the virtues I have, but because of the ugly flaws I don't have... So.  Charlie and I didn't match. After her I was determined to never get out of my league again.}

<ACTION_ALT>__{TWO TURNTABLES}
<ACTION>__{with the mixer in the middle. "Just Begun" by Jimmy Castor spins on turntable #1.  A hand reaches in, and begins to draw the slides down, quieting the music. Rob looks up from behind the deejay table, set up amongst the instruments.  The place is packed with people, and everyone seems to be having a great time. Almost everyone -- Rob sees Barry, who pretends to nod off when Rob catches his eye, and Justin, who looks back at him and mocks a bulimic act.  Rob gives him the finger.  He sees Laura, and she beams at him.  He comes to the front of the stage, and taps a microphone.}

<DIAL>__{Uh, thanks for uh, coming out tonight. I hope you have a good time.  And I hope you like the record.  The one by the Kinky Wizards.  The record that we're having this record release party for.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(hoots from the crowd)}
<DIAL>__{Thanks.  Listen to it first, though.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(laughs)}
<DIAL>__{Okay.  We'll get to that later. Right now, I'd like to introduce...}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(mumbles)}
<DIAL>__{Sonic Death Monkey.}
<ACTION>__{Good-natured applause.  Rob steps down and bee-lines to Laura. Barry and his crew mount the stage.  Rob takes a big gulp of beer.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(to Laura)}
<DIAL>__{I'm an idiot.  I should have played the record first.  This place is about to get burned down.}
<CHAR>__{LAURA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's gonna be fine.  These people are ready for anything.}
<CHAR>__{BARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(dubious)}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, well...}
<ACTION>__{Barry stands in front of the mic, surveying the crowd with a smile.  He and the band all wear suits and ties.}
<CHAR>__{BARRY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thanks for the enthusiastic intro, Rob.  We're not called Sonic Death Monkey anymore, though, ladies and gentlemen.  We might be on the verge of becoming the Atavistics, but we haven't decided yet.  But tonight, we are... BARRY JIVE AND THE UPTOWN FIVE!  ONE TWO THREE --And they launch into Marvin Gaye's "Got To Give It Up," almost flawlessly faithful to the original.  Barry is transformed -- shuffling footwork, a wide smile, and when the intro winds up, an almost perfect falsetto.  The crowd goes nuts, filling the floor.  Rob is stunned, begins to smile.  Laura takes his hand and leads him out into the crowd...}
