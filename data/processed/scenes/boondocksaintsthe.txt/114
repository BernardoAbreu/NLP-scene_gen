<L>__{interior church priest's booth early morning}
<A>__{rocco takes the priest and puts his face in front of the slider to smecker's booth, gun to the back of his head.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{don't do this my son.}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{open it!}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{have you no fear of god?}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{that's who i'm doing this for, now open the fuckin' thing.}
<A>__{connor gets the slider open. rocco's long hair hangs just inches from connor's face. connor puts his thumb and forefinger through, desperately reaching for a lock of rocco's hair. rocco jostles the priest and puts the gun hard to his head.}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{father, i will do you right here.}
<C>__{priest}
<P>__{(slowly obey, whispering)}
<D>__{god have mercy on my soul.}
<A>__{rocco starts to move the priest aside and put his gun to smecker's now open slider. just then connor snags a piece of rocco's hair and pulls him back hard and fast by it, until his head slams into the lattice work. rocco grabs the priest back into position. connor grabs a nice wad of rocco's hair with his left hand, so that the side of rocco's face is now pressed to the lattice. connor then puts a gun to rocco's head.}
<C>__{connor}
<P>__{(hard whisper)}
<D>__{you little fuck. let him go. i will drop you right here.}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{okay, just calm down. he could hurt us, brother. he could ruin the whole thing.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{let him go or i will deliver you, right now.}
<P>__{(pulls hammer back)}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{you won't do it connor, you won't. you love me man.}
