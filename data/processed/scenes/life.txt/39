<L>__{exterior camp 8 yard dusk}
<A>__{a punch sends ray sprawling in the dust. goldmouth looms over him. the incorrigibles form a circle around the combatants. poker face, the camp bookie, is taking all bets.}
<C>__{goldmouth}
<D>__{how you like your corn bread now, new york?}
<A>__{goldmouth and ray square off. goldmouth swings, ray ducks and counters with a swift jab to the gut. goldmouth just flashes a shiny grin and clobbers ray with a fist the size of a thanksgiving turkey. ray sinks to the dust. radio drops down near him.}
<C>__{radio}
<D>__{come on, new york, you can do better than that! get up and show him how they do it in harlem!}
<A>__{ray shakes his head and staggers back to his feet. he circles the big man and gets in a couple of good shots, much to the crowd's approval. goldmouth shakes his head and wipes the blood from his nose. now he's mad. he grabs ray by the shirt and delivers a crushing blow. ray reels backward into cookie's arms.}
<C>__{cookie}
<D>__{i appreciate you going to all this trouble over my corn bread. i don't get a lot of compliments in my line of work.}
<A>__{cookie shoves ray back into the ring for more punishment. claude emerges from the mess hall, munching on a piece of corn bread. he squeezes in between poker face and willie.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{your pal's getting the tar whipped out of him on your account.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{how many times i got to tell you? he ain't my pal. besides, he looks like he knows what he's doing.}
<A>__{just then claude winces as goldmouth delivers a jaw crushing uppercut that knocks ray on his back. claude bristles under the incriminating looks coming at him from all directions.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{alright, alright...}
<A>__{claude crouches down as ray rolls over on his stomach and pushes himself up onto all fours. his eyes are swollen shut, his face covered with blood.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{hey, ray, i think you made your point, whatever that is. maybe now's a good time to throw in the towel. you know what i'm saying?}
<A>__{ray manages a smile and staggers to his feet.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(slurring)}
<D>__{shit, goldmouth. back in new york, i know bitches who hit harder than you.}
<A>__{goldmouth pulls back his fist and lets it fly. ray hurtles through the crowd, collapsing in the dust. willie steps in.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{the man's taken enough of a beating. let's get him inside.}
<A>__{cookie, radio and poker face raise ray to his feet. goldmouth slings him over his shoulder and carries him toward the bunkhouse. dazed, ray catches claude's eye.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{got him good, huh, claude? he won't be bothering us anytime soon.}
<A>__{a quick elbow jab from goldmouth and ray is out for good. disgusted with himself, claude tosses what's left of the corn bread to the mangy dog, who makes short work of it.}
<C>__{biscuit}
<P>__{(wagging a finger)}
<D>__{shame, shame, that's your name.}
