<L>__{interior sara's cabin. night}
<A>__{inman enters the cabin. it's a single room. a big fire. the baby on the bed, a rudimentary crib unoccupied next to it. the woman is already at the little stove. she turns to him. she's painfully beautiful. but sad and fragile. inman, despite himself, is mesmerized.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i'm alone here, as you can see, with my baby. i need to believe you mean no harm.}
<A>__{inman takes out his gun. she starts, terrified.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{no, i mean to give it to you.}
<A>__{he turns it handle forwards and offers it to her.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i don't want it. i had my way they'd take metal altogether out of this world. every blade, every gun.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{is your baby sick?}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{he cries. i don't know. he cries a lot. my man is dead. he took his wound at fredericksburg. never saw his boy.}
<A>__{she never once looks at him. her eyes on the floor or the food or the baby.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{it's pretty much what you'll get if you knock on any door of this war. man dead, woman left.}
<A>__{she hands him a plate of steaming beans. an onion perched on top.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{it's mean food but it's hot.}
<A>__{she goes over to the bed and picks up her baby and starts the same business of walking him, singing the while, an odd lament. inman eats, looks at her, at the child and the fire. he picks up the onion, bites into it. sara looks across.}
<C>__{inman}
<P>__{(ashamed of his hunger)}
<D>__{there's no hunting on the road, just cress and }
<A>__{he takes another bite. sara picks up the baby.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i need to feed this man, if you could look away.}
<A>__{inman, embarrassed, turns his back to her. he sits finishing the food while she puts the baby to her breast, slipping the shoulder from her dress. while the baby feeds.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{used to have a cow, few goats. raiders took them. made me kill our own dog on the porch. that poor creature watched over me. nothing left now save a hog and couple of chickens to live off till spring. i will have to kill that hog and make sense of the flesh and divisions which is something i never did.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{i could do that for you in the morning.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i'm not asking.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{it's what i'd gladly do for you for what you're gladly doing for me. i'm inman by the way. that's my name.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i'm sara. my baby's ethan.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{glad to know you both.}
