<A>__{phelps crawls like hell to get into position. looking up, he sees krieger pointing frantically behind him. phelps turns. ethan is climbing out the trap door. a cable and hook swing down from the helicopter, almost touching the roof of the train. phelps crawls closer to it. ethan, behind him, is in a far more precarious position. without goggles or suction cups, he has to use his fingers to grab small holes on the roof. he is flipped over by the wind, ending up facing the other way. loses his grip and is blown backwards over the roof.}
