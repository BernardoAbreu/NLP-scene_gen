<C>__{wet varnish}
<A>__{full shot foyer. full shot foyer. in the b.g. is a painter, varnishing the floor. he looks up in complete dismay as he sees his newly varnished floor being violated. after a couple of steps, jim stops, suddenly aware of the painter. the painter rises, throws down his brush, says something caustic.}
<C>__{bill's voice}
<P>__{(imitating painter)}
<D>__{don't mind me, buddy, i just got through varnishing that floor.}
<A>__{jim reacts, raises a tentative foot, the sticky varnish practically holding it to the floor. jim says something.}
<C>__{bill's voice}
<D>__{whose bright idea was this?}
<A>__{the painter says something, points at muriel. jim looks darkly and accusingly at muriel whose weak smile is an admission of guilt.}
<C>__{bill's voice}
<D>__{she just wanted everything to be nice and shiny on the day they moved in.}
<A>__{jim turns and shouts something to the painter.}
<C>__{bill's voice}
<D>__{stop painting that floor and put some planks down in here, or some thing!}
<A>__{the painter shouts back.}
<C>__{bill's voice}
<D>__{okay, mister, but take it easy. the republicans ain't in yet, you know.}
<A>__{jim reacts, turns and walks back out of the foyer, desperately trying to match his clearly outlined incoming footsteps. each step is outlined by strands of thick sticky varnish.}
