<L>__{interior lab night montage}
<A>__{susan and siri, both wearing walkman headsets, deftly mount butterflies and other insects onto display boards for the exhibit. rain is blowing in through the half open window. their movements are precise and lyrical, the colors and designs of the insects are beautiful. we understand how you can get lost in this world. susan works steadily, a partially eaten pay day bar and the wrappers of several others are evidence of her dinner. a pager goes off in susan's lab coat. she takes off her headset; classical music leaks from her headphones. on the pager's lcd screen the message reads: late}
<B>__{tonight. pete.}
<A>__{susan puts the pager down. goes to close the window. there is a loud, angry buzzing sound.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{siri?}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{siri?!}
<A>__{siri pulls her headset off; heavy metal music leaks from her headphones. the buzzing sound again. we pan across the various bugs and mounting implements till we come to rest... ...on the shoebox the boys gave susan. something rattles wildly inside.}
<C>__{siri}
<D>__{...the fuck?}
<A>__{susan crosses to the trash bin, picks the box out. it vibrates on her hand, then becomes quiet, something moves inside. she slowly opens the lid. the bottom of the box is littered with two inches of shredded newspaper. crumbs of bread and some rice krispies can be spotted here and there: a kid's idea of a comfy critter's nest. she moves her free hand closer.}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(to siri)}
<D>__{can you...?}
<A>__{suddenly and insect big as her hand springs out of the shredded paper nest and tries to grab on to her! minute pieces of paper fly through the air!! susan slaps the lid back down.}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(a scared whisper)}
<D>__{could you...help me...?}
