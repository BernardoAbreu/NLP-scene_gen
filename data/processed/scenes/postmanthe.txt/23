<L>__{exterior training grounds day}
<A>__{the conscripts stand at attention under the guard of idaho and two other soldiers. to their right is a dead oak tree. behind them, three rows of folding chairs. two figures approach. bethlehem and getty. getty carries a sheathed sword. bethlehem surveys the troops taking no more notice of the postman than anyone else.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{the laws of eight, gentlemen. that is the legacy handed down to us by nathan holn.}
<A>__{at the mention of this name, the recruits shout as one.}
<C>__{recruits}
<D>__{god rest his soul!}
<C>__{the postman}
<P>__{(low)}
<D>__{may he burn in hell.}
<A>__{getty looks over at him. he heard him. the postman swallows hard. getty stares hard. then he turns away. he's not going to bust him on it.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{these are the laws that we live by. the eight is our symbol. each man will bear it with pride.}
<A>__{bethlehem nods at idaho who pushes up his own sleeve to reveal the branded 8.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{only then will you be part of the clan. sit down, gentlemen.}
<A>__{the men move to sit in one of the three rows. only then does it become apparent that there are 18 men and only 17 chairs. one slow recruit is left standing. it doesn't take him long to realize that he's in trouble.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{law one. you will obey orders without question.}
<P>__{(to slow recruit)}
<D>__{i told you to sit.}
<C>__{slow recruit}
<P>__{(scared)}
<D>__{there weren't enough chairs.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{i didn't specify chairs. you could've sat down on the ground.}
<A>__{the slow recruit moves to do so.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{you disobeyed a direct order. you broke law one.}
<A>__{idaho and another soldier step up beside the slow recruit.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{law two. punishment shall be swift.}
<A>__{they hustle the recruit to the tree. idaho unslings a coil of rope, throws it over a tree limb. they quickly slip a loop over the slow recruit's ankles and haul him upside down into the air.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{law three: mercy is for the weak. four: terror will defeat reason. five: your allegiance is to the clan. six: justice can be dictated. law seven. any clansman may challenge for leadership of the clan. does any man here wish to challenge me?}
<A>__{there are no takers.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{on your feet!}
<A>__{the conscripts stand like jackknives snapping open. without a word, without a look bethlehem reaches out and draws a sword from a sheath that getty holds. bethlehem steps to the slow recruit who slowly twists around.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{law eight: there is only one penalty: death.}
<A>__{bethlehem raises the sword.}
<C>__{slow recruit}
<D>__{please, i'm begging you.}
<B>__{the postman}
<A>__{as the sword finds its mark. bethlehem looks at him, but addresses all.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{you will get out of this army what you put into it. work and you'll be fed. fight and you'll be respected. die and you'll be remembered. it's up to you.}
<A>__{bethlehem turns and walks away. getty following behind. the postman watches as they go. idaho steps up to him.}
<C>__{idaho}
<D>__{you thinking of challenging for leadership of the clan?}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{no, sir. i'm a follower not a leader.}
<C>__{idaho}
<D>__{you see colonel getty? always following the general? he's the only man who ever challenged. fight lasted six seconds, but the general didn't kill him. he cut off his tongue and he cut off his balls and old getty's been following him like a dog ever since.}
<A>__{the postman looks back to see bethlehem and getty disappear into the gloom. idaho grins, likes how this affects a new man. the postman moves on. idaho stops woody as he passes.}
<C>__{idaho}
<D>__{the general don't see it, but i say you got some nigger in you.}
<A>__{woody clenches his jaw, but wisely doesn't answer.}
