<L>__{exterior gale home establishing night}
<A>__{the house is an immaculately restored two story victorian, far better than what a university professor can afford. the grounds are perfect. david's volvo is in the driveway, his wife's new laredo beside it. on the street out front sits a new vw beetle.}
<L>__{interior kid's room night}
<A>__{david's son chase sits in bed holding a stuffed sheep in the air. david turns off the light in the adjacent bathroom, comes in holding his son's jeans and shoes. david wears a t shirt which says "evil doer & curious person." the room is over decorated with boy stuff.}

<D>__{did you mark your calendar?}
<C>__{chase}
<P>__{(looking up at it)}
<D>__{yep.}
<A>__{insert kid's calendar hangs above the bed, opened to the month of march. it has a felt tipped pen hanging from a piece of string taped to it. ten frowny faces cover ten consecutive days, then there are three empty days before a large smiley face awaits on the fourth. the frowny faces are in a kid's hand, the smiley face in an adult's.}
