<L>__{interior closet night}
<A>__{still unconscious, corky's head jerks, reacting to the kick. we see the dried blood caked to her check where his kick split the skin. she is again swimming toward consciousness. we hear water splash, her face flinching as we move closer, the sounds and voices echoing.}
<C>__{cesar }
<D>__{wake up! come on, you fucking dyke!}
<A>__{we hear caesar slapping her.}
<C>__{caesar }
<D>__{wake up!}
<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{corky's face is dripping with water as her eyes slowly blink open. coming into focus is caesar, standing over her with an empty glass in one hand.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{except for the gag, she is bound as we have seen her bound in the closet. caesar yanks out his gun and puts it to her head.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{i know everything now so i don't want to hear any "i don't know" bullshit, you understand?}
<A>__{she sees violet on the bed, also bound hand and foot.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{god, i should have seen this coming! the second i met you, i knew it. everyone knows your kind can't be trusted! fucking queers make me sick.}
<A>__{the gun digs into her cheek.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{but you tried to fuck the wrong guy. and i swear to you that i'm going to kill you for it.}
<A>__{he thumbs back the hammer.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{where is the money?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{don't tell him }
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{shut up, violet!}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{he can't kill you }
<A>__{he aims the gun at violet.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{violet!}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{not until he has the money!}
<A>__{he fires and she jumps as the bullet punches through the wall behind her. his point made, he puts the gun back to corky's head.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{now, where the fuck is my money?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{lick me.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{where is it?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face.}
<A>__{blood temperature rising again, caesar pulls the gun back and slaps her with it.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{stupid cunt!}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think }
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{don't try to tell me what to do.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you need the money just like we do.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{shut up, violet.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{let us go and we'll make a deal.}
<A>__{he rushes at her, grabbing a fistful of her hair.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{shut the fuck up!}
<A>__{he looks at corky.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{what did you do to her?! this isn't my violet!}
<A>__{he looks at her as if unable to recognize her}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{what did she do to you?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{everything you couldn't.}
<A>__{he shoves her down.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{you ungrateful bitch! you had nothing before i met you. you were nothing!}
<A>__{he stomps around the room.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{who gave you this place? this apartment?}
<A>__{he throws open the closet.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{who gave us all of this? i did! i gave you everything! i gave you this life! i made you, violet. i saved you.}
<A>__{he seems to believe what he is saying.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{i saved you.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{ha! what a load of crap. look at yourself, caesar. you're a thug. |you launder money for the mob. you rent women like you rented this apartment.}
<A>__{he doesn't want to hear this.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{saved me? you don't even know me. you used me, caesar, just like i used you. all part of the business.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{you betrayed me!}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you murdered gino!}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{i had to. you made me.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{bullshit, you killed him. not me. you did it because you couldn't stand the thought of johnnie fucking you.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{shut up!}
<A>__{he slaps her.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{okay, you want business, i will give you the fucking business.}
<A>__{he leans closer.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{i'm going to make you beg just like shelly did. just like shelly!}
<A>__{he storms out of the room. corky looks up at violet.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i'm sorry, corky ...}
<C>__{corky}
