<L>__{interior lakeview lunch night}
<A>__{smecker surveys photos and papers, as he smokes profusely. he stands next to a table in the back where chairs are knocked over. body chalk and blood stains are everywhere. the detectives seem like they don't want to be there, again.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{the shooter knew these guys, huh?}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{how do you figure?}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{friends, gentlemen. they were friends.}
<A>__{smecker flashes them a photo of a dead body. the victim is shot in the head and face down in his plate of food. his hands are on the table in front of him.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{these guys were packing. not one hand near a gun. it's simple human behavior. someone you don't know approaches you, you put your hand on it. this guy's got his hands on the table. he's eating his food, for christ sakes. they were friends.}
<A>__{smecker looks over the bar.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{these two fucking scenes are related. too many coincidences. same day? five hours apart? dead mobsters on both scenes. now, why did he kill the bartender?}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{crime of passion. he just went nuts. he would have shot everyone in here. he just ran out of bullets.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{duffy. this look like a fucking post office to you? this guy came in here with intent. maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. the bartender wasn't a fucking accident.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{well, we didn't get any help on that. a lot of people saw it. nobody's talking.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{fucking figures. look, are you guys seeing the pattern here? we got big questions at both of these crime scenes, with no answers. why did they kill the guys in the other two booths? why did he do the bartender? it would seem unnecessary, even stupid.}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{god, i hate cold crime scenes! i'm fucking leaving now. and do me a favor, tell me when the next guy dies, cause these guys are not done yet.}
<A>__{he storms to the entry way.}
