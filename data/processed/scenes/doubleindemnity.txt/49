<D>__{i guess i don't have to tell you what i was going to do at eleven o'clock, keyes. for the first time i saw a way to get clear of the whole mess i was in, and of phyllis, too, all at the same time. yeah, that's what i thought. but what i didn't know was that she was all set for me. that she had outsmarted me again, just like she always had...}
<A>__{d 19 hall stairway of dietrichson home (night) the lights are turned on. phyllis is coming down the stairs. she wears white lounging pajamas, and she is carrying something small and heavy concealed in a scarf in her right hand. she reaches the front door, opens it slightly, fixes the catch so that the door can be opened from outside. she switches off the porch light and the hall light. she moves towards the living room, where there is still light on.}
<C>__{neff's voice}
<D>__{she was all set and waiting for me. it could have been something in my voice when i called her up that tipped her off. and it could have been that she had the idea already. and an idea wasn't the only thing she had waiting for me.}
<A>__{d 20 living room on the long table behind the davenport, one of the lamps is lit. the only other light in the room is a standing lamp beside the desk. a window toward the back is open, and through it comes the sounds of music, probably a neighboring radio. phyllis enters and crosses to the table. she puts out the lamp, then moves over to the desk and puts out the lamp there. the room is filled with bright moonlight coming in at the windows. phyllis crosses to the chair by the fireplace (the one she sat in the first time neff came to the house). she lifts the loose cushion and puts what was in the scarf behind it. as she withdraws the scarf, there is a brief glint of something metallic before she covers the hidden object with the cushion again. she turns to the low table in front of the davenport and takes a cigarette from the box. she takes a match and is about to strike it when, just then, she hears a car coming up the hill. she listens, motionless. the car stops. a car door is slammed. calmly, phyllis strikes the match and lights her cigarette. she drops the match casually into a tray, goes back to the chair, sits down and waits, quietly smoking. there are footsteps outside the house. over the chair in which phyllis is sitting, the hallway is visible through the arch. the front door opens. neff comes in, he is silhouetted against the moonlight as he stands there. he closes the door again.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<P>__{(in foreground)}
<D>__{in here, walter.}
<A>__{neff comes through the arch and walks slowly towards her.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{hello, baby. anybody else in the house?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{nobody. why?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{what's that music?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{a radio up the street.}
<A>__{neff sits down on the arm of the davenport, close to her.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{just like the first time i was here. we were talking about automobile insurance. only you were thinking about murder. and i was thinking about that anklet.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{and what are you thinking about now?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i'm all through thinking. this is goodbye.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{goodbye? where are you going?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{it's you that's going, baby. not me. i'm getting off the trolley car right at this corner.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{suppose you stop being fancy. let's have it, whatever it is.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i have a friend who's got a funny theory. he says when two people commit a murder they're kind of on a trolley car, and one can't get off without the other. they're stuck with each other. they have to go on riding clear to the end of the line. and the last stop is the cemetery.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{maybe he's got something there.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{you bet he has, two people are going to ride to the end of the line, all right. only i'm not going to be one of them. i've got another guy to finish my ride for me.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{so you've got it all arranged, walter.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{you arranged it for me. i didn't have to do a thing.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{just who are you talking about?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{an acquaintance of yours. a mr. zachetti. come on, baby, i just got into this because i knew a little something about insurance, didn't i? i was just a sucker. i'd have been brushed off as soon as you got your hands on the money.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{save it. i'm telling this. it's been you and that zachetti guy all along, hasn't it?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{that's not true.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{it doesn't make any difference whether it's true or not. the point is keyes believes zachetti is the guy he's been looking for. he'll have him in that gas chamber before he knows what happened to him.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{and what's happening to me all this time?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{don't be silly. what do you expect to happen to you? you helped him do the murder, didn't you? that's what keyes thinks. and what's good enough for keyes is good enough for me.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{maybe it's not good enough for me. walter. maybe i don't go for the idea. maybe i'd rather talk.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{sometimes people are where they can't talk. under six feet of dirt, for instance. and if it was you, they'd just charge it up to zachetti, wouldn't they. one more item on his account. sure they would. that's just what they're going to do. especially since he's coming here, tonight... oh, in about fifteen minutes from now, baby. with the cops right behind him. it's all taken care of.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{and that'd make everything lovely for you, wouldn't it?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{right. and it's got to be done before that suit of yours comes to trial, and lola gets a chance to sound off, and they trip you up on the stand, and you start to fold up and drag me down with you.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{listen, walter. maybe i had zachetti here so they won't get a chance to trip me up. so we can get that money and be together.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{that's cute. say it again.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{he came here the first time just to ask where lola was. i made him come back. i was working on him. he's crazy sort of guy, quick tempered. i kept hammering into him that she was with another man, so he'd get into one of his jealous rages, and then i'd tell him where she was. and you know what he'd have done to her, don't you, walter.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{yeah, and for once i believe you. because it's just rotten enough.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{we're both rotten, walter.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{only you're just a little more rotten. you're rotten clear through. you got me to take care of your husband, and then you got zachetti to take care of lola, and maybe take care of me too, and then somebody else would have come along to take care of zachetti for you. that's the way you operate isn't it, baby.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{suppose it is, walter. is what you've cooked up for tonight any better?}
<A>__{neff gets up from the davenport. he listens to the music for a moment.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i don't like this music anymore. it's too close. do you mind if i shut the window?}
<A>__{phyllis just stares at him. he goes quietly over to the window and shuts it and draws the curtain. phyllis speaks to his back:}
<C>__{phyllis}
<P>__{(her voice low and urgent)}
<D>__{walter!}
<A>__{neff turns, something changes in his face. there is the report of a gun. he stands motionless for a moment, then very slowly starts towards her. camera is shooting over his shoulder at phyllis as she stands with the gun in her hand. neff stops after he has taken a few steps.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{what's the matter? why don't you shoot again? maybe if i came a little closer?}
<A>__{neff takes a few more steps towards her and stops again.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{how's that. do you think you can do it now?}
<A>__{phyllis is silent. she doesn't shoot. her expression is tortured. neff goes on until he is close to her. quietly he takes the gun out of her unresisting hand.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{why didn't you shoot, baby?}
<A>__{phyllis puts her arms around him in complete surrender.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{don't tell me it's because you've been in love with me all this time.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{no. i never loved you, walter. not you, or anybody else. i'm rotten to the heart. i used you, just as you said. that's all you ever meant to me until a minute ago. i didn't think anything like that could ever happen to me.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i'm sorry, baby. i'm not buying.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i'm not asking you to buy. just hold me close.}
<A>__{neff draws her close to him. she reaches up to his face and kisses him on the lips. as she comes out of the kiss there is realization in her eyes that this is the final moment.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{goodbye, baby.}
<A>__{out of the shot the gun explodes once, twice. phyllis quivers in his arms. her eyes fill with tears. her head falls limp against his shoulder. slowly he lifts her and carries her to the davenport. he lays her down on it carefully, almost tenderly. the moonlight coming in at the french doors shines on the anklet. he looks at it for the last time and slowly turns away. as he does so, he puts his hand inside his coat and it comes out with blood on it. only then is it apparent that phyllis' shot actually did hit him. he looks at the blood on his fingers with a dazed expression and quickly goes out of the room, the way he came. d 21 exterior dietrichson home (night) neff comes out of the house. he closes the front door with his right hand. his left arm hangs limp. he takes a few steps down the walk, then suddenly hears somebody approaching. he moves behind the palm tree near the walk. a man comes up the steps towards the front door zachetti. just as he reaches the door, neff calls to him.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{hey you. come here a minute. i said come here, zachetti.}
<A>__{zachetti turns and approaches him slowly.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{the name is neff.}
<C>__{zachetti}
<D>__{yeah? and i still don't like it. what do you want?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{look, kid, i want to give you a present.}
<A>__{he takes some loose change out of his pocket and holds out a coin.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{here's a nice new nickel.}
<C>__{zachetti}
<D>__{what's the gag?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{suppose you go back down the hill to a drug store and make a phone call.}
<A>__{neff starts to drop the nickel into zachetti's handkerchief pocket. zachetti knocks his hand away.}
<C>__{zachetti}
<D>__{keep your nickel and buy yourself an ice cream cone.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{the number is granite 0386. ask for miss dietrichson. the first name is lola.}
<C>__{zachetti}
<D>__{lola? she isn't worth a nickel. and if i ever talk to her, it's not going to be over any telephone.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{tough, aren't you? take the nickel. take it and call her. she wants you to.}
<C>__{zachetti}
<D>__{yeah? she doesn't want any part of me.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i know who told you that, and it's not true. she's in love with you. always has been. don't ask me why. i couldn't even guess.}
<A>__{zachetti just stares at him. neff moves again to put the nickel into zachetti's pocket. this time zachetti allows him to do it.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{now beat it. granite 0386, i told you.}
<A>__{he motions toward the street below.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{that way.}
<A>__{zachetti goes slowly past him. neff grabs him and pushes him almost violently down the walk. zachetti goes out of shot. the sound of his steps dies away as neff looks after him. then, far off in the distance, the siren of a police car is heard. neff moves off through the shrubbery toward the side of the house where he parked his car.}
