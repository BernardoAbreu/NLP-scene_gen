<L>__{exterior malt shop ten minutes later, rain}
<A>__{calvin emerges from the alley that separates the malt shop from another storefront (perhaps now a rundown thai restaurant.)}
<B>__{closer on him}
<A>__{watching the cars fly by on the wet avenue. suddenly, a cross dressing street walker steps up to him with a cigarette.}
<C>__{street walker}
<D>__{you got a light, honey?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{what?! a light! yes, i've got a light!}
<C>__{street walker}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{fumbling, he finally gets her little cigar lighted with one of his kitchen matches.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{so...you...survived the blast, did you?}
<C>__{street walker}
<D>__{the blast? honey, i have survived a host of things. like the song says: "a country boy can survive!"}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{yes, yes, the song. so tell me...has it been...hell up here?}
<C>__{street walker}
<D>__{"hell up here?" honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! hell everywhere.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{yes, i can tell that just looking around.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{"boy?" did you say you were a "country boy?"}
<C>__{street walker}
<D>__{cute little old man, if you want a boy, i can be a boy. and if you want a girl, i can be a girl. i can be anything you want me to be!}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{street walker}
<D>__{uh huh. and it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! and if you act now, i might even throw in some free lawn furniture.}
<C>__{calvin}
<P>__{(stumbling away from her)}
<D>__{no, i can't. i'm sorry! i have to go! i have to...}
<A>__{he breaks into a trot, heading up the street past a seedy bar (used to be the convenience store) just as a hopelessly drunk hag of a woman is shoved out and told to stay out. calvin watches as the woman stumbles to the curb where she tosses her cookies. two low riders hop by full of taunting young hispanic gang members, one of whom brandishes a pistol and, just for fun, points it at calvin. when calvin sees the pistol he ducks into the adult bookstore. the young gang member pulls the trigger and we (not calvin) see that the realistic looking pistol is really a water gun.}
