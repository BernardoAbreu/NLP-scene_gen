<L>__{interior confessional booth church day}
<A>__{maggie kneels, hands folded reverently. the booth's grate opens before her.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{bless me, father, for i have sinned. my last confession was... ahh... she tries to recall.}
<C>__{maggie }
<A>__{... anyway, i have sort of a technical question here. i've been having bad thoughts. i mean, really bad thoughts}
<B>__{...}
<C>__{priest}
<A>__{of an impure nature?}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{no like i'm having a problem with that whole turn the other cheek concept. i want revenge. i want to destroy this guy's life, career, everything. on the sin scale, how big is that? i mean, can i "hail mary" my way out of it?}
<C>__{priest}
<A>__{child, any sin in one's heart is...}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(impatient)}
<A>__{the name's maggie. it wasn't this side of ten years ago that you had your tongue down my throat. so don't call me "child", brian. it annoys me.}
<D>__{priest brian}
<A>__{now don't get upset. brian closes the confessional window and exits}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(still inside the booth)}
<A>__{brian, open up. don't ignore me. brian leans into her confessional. she steps out to join him.}
<C>__{brian}
<A>__{you're not even catholic, maggie you really shouldn't come to confession. he's a nice looking and gentle man. they regard each other for a beat.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{i'm sorry. i'm just so stressed out about that slime ball reporter being in town. i jus had to come warn you he might show up here and start asking you all kinds of ridiculous questions. brian moves away. maggie follows and sits in a nearby pew.}
<C>__{brian}
<A>__{actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question. the rest weren't so bad.}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(sliding along the pew)}
<A>__{what? you talked to him! did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?}
<C>__{brian}
<A>__{yes, yes, i'm sure i only did you good, maggie.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{what did he ask? a woman, mrs. murphy, rushes in.}
<C>__{mrs. murphy}
<A>__{father, am i too late?}
<C>__{brian}
<A>__{no, no.}
<C>__{mrs. murphy}
<A>__{it won't take long. jus two venials. the woman goes into the confessional booth to wait.}
<C>__{brian}
<A>__{only respectful things. what did we have in common back then... what kind of music did you like... did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar...}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{and what did you say?}
<C>__{brian}
<A>__{how could i be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as god intended?}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(relieved)}
<A>__{good one! thanks.}
<C>__{brian}
<A>__{it happens to be how i feel. brian sits next to maggie.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{god... of course. i'm sorry i mean, i'm...}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<A>__{brian i've got to go. the man's a lunatic, but i know exactly where he's going nexterior}
<C>__{brian}
<A>__{god bless you, maggie. she turns to rush out, then stops herself.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{oh, wait, my purse. she moves to the confessional, knocks, then speaks to mrs. murphy.}
<C>__{maggie }
<A>__{excuse me, sorry, forgot my purse. good luck. maggie closes the booth curtain and turns to brian.}
<C>__{maggie }
<A>__{wait what was the ridiculous question he asked? brian smiles mischievously.}
<C>__{brian}
<A>__{he wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{weird. like after all those years you would remem she starts to go, then stops in her tracks as she hears:}
<C>__{brian}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<A>__{ scrambled, with salt, pepper and dill. same as me. maggie looks at brian. suddenly, she remembers too.}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(tenderly)}
<A>__{i'm really sorry that i hurt you, brian.}
<C>__{brian}
<A>__{i'm happy here, where i'm supposed to be. but if you ever become a catholic, may i ask you a favor, maggie?}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{of course.}
<C>__{brian}
<A>__{could your confess to father patrick from now on?}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{of course. and she scampers out. brian goes back into the confessional.}
