<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{later. paul has gone. gene and amelia are at the bar, huddled over his beer and her coke.}
<C>__{amelia }
<D>__{gene had a terrible marriage and was separated from his alcoholic adulterous wife. but he was too kind to humiliate her with a divorce...}
<A>__{gene drains the last of his beer.}
<D>__{amelia (v.o.) (cont’d) as a result, he was basically a single parent to their young son, gore.}
<A>__{he glances at his watch. wow.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{i'm rattling on here, and you've got a morning train.}
<A>__{but she's just staring in his eyes. this could be her last chance to ask...}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{how's nina doing?}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{oh, fine.}
<A>__{really? he smiles, gently.}
<P>__{gene (cont’d)}
<D>__{actually, she hasn't been feeling her best. she'll probably summer in newport. so my kid's stuck with dad again.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{if you two get bored, i could tag along sometimes.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{you suggesting you're less boring than i am?}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{well, yeh.}
<A>__{he smiles first. hers is slower, but here it comes.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{any given meal, i can eat a lobster and have you boys in stitches.}
<A>__{a full beat. he's deciding.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{gore would love that. he has a little crush, i'm afraid.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{at seven?}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{he's eight.}
<A>__{well, then. he breaks the look. fishes out some cash for the bar tab.}
<P>__{gene (cont’d)}
<D>__{listen, paul and i would be thrilled to rope you into our shuttle.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{are you kidding, it's a godsend. no matter how hard george and i work, how many lectures we cram in, there's never enough money for the next adventure.}
<A>__{he looks at her. lets the silence sit there. his eyes seem to convey a depth of understanding.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{the next adventure. what is it?}
<A>__{she shrugs. no idea.}
<P>__{gene (cont’d)}
<D>__{because we're running out of oceans.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{wish you'd do something about that.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{i'm serious, amelia.}
<A>__{her soft smile.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{i know. always.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{the only way you can stay where you are. and be who you are...}
<A>__{serious indeed.}
<P>__{gene (cont’d)}
<D>__{is to keep feeding the beast.}
<A>__{she can't smile anymore. because this is the very fear she lives with.}
<P>__{gene (cont’d)}
<D>__{and the beast always needs something larger, greater, more daring...}
<C>__{amelia }
<D>__{he costs money, too.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{the price of fame, literally. do you and george talk about this?}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{we don't have to.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{with all respect. yes, you do.}
