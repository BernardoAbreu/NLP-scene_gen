<P>__{(proudly)}
<D>__{of course i did... they offered me anything... anything i wanted to go with them. 2nd new prisoner hey! i saw the circus in berlin about four years ago... didn't you make your entrance in a long tail coat with a pair of tails on the jacket about fifty feet long? sure! and a funny little clown at the very end carrying the tails like a woman's train?}
<A>__{helmut studies the prisoners glare and decides he couldn't even remember the clown he saw was gustav the great, why not? no one would ever know... and he nods with a kind of studied humility... yes.}

<D>__{hey, galt, it's your turn, how about doin' one of your belly dances for us?}

<D>__{you're wasting your time. he doesn't perform for the likes of us... he'll turn you down.}
