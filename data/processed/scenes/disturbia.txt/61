<L>__{interior kale's bedroom night later}
<A>__{tracking across kale's room the two tri pod mounted dv cams stand watch over giles' house. one camera feeds a grainy close up shot of giles' garage door to ronnie's portable tv on the floor. the other feeds a wide shot of giles' entire house to kale's color tv. both images appear on kale's computer monitor. wider to reveal kale and ashley sit on the floor near the window. kale peers over to giles with the binoculars as ashley messes with kale's cell phone. in the b.g. ronnie's passed out on kale's bed, his hand resting inside the pizza box just inches from the last slice.}
<C>__{kale}
<P>__{(re: giles)}
<D>__{he's been gone awhile.}
<A>__{on ashley she's messing with kale's cell phone.}
<C>__{ashley}
<P>__{(handing him his cell)}
<D>__{here.}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{how'd you get my phone?}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{i'm crafty like that.}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{what'd you do?}
<A>__{ashley carefully unclips ronnie's cell from his hip, flips it open, dials. after a beat, kale's cell rings with madonna's "like a virgin." kale laughs.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{every time he calls, that's what you'll hear.}
<A>__{kale laughs as ashley delicately re clips the phone to ronnie's belt. kale's pov the pilch's dog, wearing a pink sweater, suddenly darts into kale's yard.}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{what the hell?}
<A>__{their pov pilch's dog stops, spins around and takes a dump.}
<C>__{kale }
<D>__{where's }
<A>__{mr. pilch, in his robe, suddenly appears from the shadows, watches the dog do its business.}
<C>__{ashley}
<P>__{(re: mr. pilch)}
<D>__{three to one he doesn't pick it up.}
<A>__{nope. the dog finishes. pilch calls it over, scoops up the dog and heads o.s.}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{so that's why the grass is greener...}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{only in disturbia...}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{so why the move?}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{what do you mean? the greener grass, the safer pastures...}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{no, seriously.}
<A>__{there's a beat as ashley locks eyes with kale. then }
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{well, i guess my mom thought it'd help keep dad on a shorter leash. city life... had its temptations...}
<P>__{(beat; then matter of fact)}
<D>__{but my mom pretty much cries just as much as she always did, and dad doesn't care more than ever.}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{what did they think, an extra bathroom and two car garage would actually change things... somehow protect them and you from all that crap you can never escape?}
<A>__{ashley holds kale's gaze for a beat. then, she nods, with:}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{something like that.}
<P>__{(eyeing the bracelet)}
<D>__{so... what're your issues, kale?}
<A>__{kale hesitates. we see in his eyes that he's flashing to the past... "going there..." there's an uneasy beat as ashley picks up on it: then headlights appear outside. kale quickly turns away from ashley, pulls one of the dv cams off its tri pod, flips out the three inch lcd screen.}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{that's him.}
<A>__{dv cam pov giles' silver toyota pulls in the driveway. stops. engine and headlights turn off.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{another car }
<A>__{dv cam pov kale zooms in. the grainy image finally steadies to reveal a second car pulling in behind giles. a thirty something attractive woman a redhead is at the wheel. she pulls in next to giles' car.}
<C>__{ashley }
<D>__{you seen her before?}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{dv cam pov giles gets out. wearing a suit, no tie.}
<C>__{ashley}
<P>__{(re: giles)}
<D>__{cute for a killer.}
<A>__{giles goes to the woman's car, opens her door.}
<C>__{ashley }
<D>__{who said chivalry's dead?}
<A>__{the woman gets out, wearing a black cocktail dress.}
<C>__{ashley }
<D>__{there's a club girl for you.}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{bright green bracelet's "the pyramids," purple's "club 360," the big black stamp's from "flavor."}
<A>__{dv cam pov kale zooms in on the woman's wrist and hand. sure enough, she's wearing both a green and a purple bracelet, and has a black stamp blotch on her hand.}
<C>__{kale}
<P>__{(over the above)}
<D>__{missing girl was seen at a club. didn't say which one though...}
<P>__{(then aside to ashley)}
<D>__{your i.d. must be pretty good.}
<C>__{ashley}
<P>__{(with a smile)}
<D>__{i don't need one.}
<A>__{they turn back to the window, watch as giles escorts the woman to the house, shows her in. a light comes on inside. dv cam pov kale zooms in on one of the living room windows, spots the woman moving around inside, looking at artwork... she sits on the sofa as giles enters with two glasses and a bottle of wine. he sits down, pours the wine. they toast, take sips. giles moves in for a kiss }
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{he's going in.}
<A>__{dv cam pov the woman shies away from giles, stands from the sofa.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{denied...}
<A>__{they watch as the woman gets up, moves to the center of the room, and starts to get a little groove on...}
<C>__{ashley }
<P>__{(been there, done that)}
<D>__{oh no, he put on music...}
<A>__{dv cam pov giles watches the woman as she seductively moves her body to the music we're not hearing.}
<C>__{ashley }
<D>__{oh, c'mon, giles, all she wants to do is dance.}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{what do you think they're listening to?}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{could be radio. see if you can find the station.}
<A>__{kale sets the camera down, turns on his receiver. as he toggles through radio stations rock, alternative...}
<C>__{ashley }
<P>__{(watching the woman & giles)}
<D>__{no... no...}
<A>__{kale flips to an easy listening r & b station playing lou rawls "you'll never find another love like mine."}
<C>__{ashley }
<D>__{stop.}
<A>__{binocular pov ashley watches as giles takes the woman's hand and dances with her. their rhythm fits the music perfectly. on ronnie he stirs on the bed, still asleep.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<P>__{(eyes closed; grinning re: music)}
<D>__{hmmm...}
<A>__{ashley and kale eye ronnie for a beat. then turn back to the window. dv cam pov kale pans back to the woman and giles. they're really dancing close now. kale's and ashley's eyes shift to each other, then quickly flick away. a beat. then ashley raises the binoculars, faces back toward giles' with:}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{now's the time to bust your move.}
<A>__{ashley glances to kale. kale turns, holds her gaze. a palpable tension between these two. they ever so slowly lean toward each other when ronnie suddenly interrupts, pushing himself between them.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<P>__{(yawning; re: woman with giles)}
<D>__{who's that?}
<A>__{ronnie looks to kale and ashley who glare back.}
<C>__{ronnie }
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{ookay, just fill me in later.}
<P>__{(taking ashley's hand)}
<D>__{a pleasure.}
<P>__{(then; aside to kale, mouths; re: ashley)}
<D>__{duude!}
<P>__{(slaps kale's hand)}
<D>__{later.}
<A>__{ronnie stands, leaves. kale shakes his head, turns back to ashley. they lean in again when ashley's cell phone ominously rings with the first measures of beethoven's 5th "bum bum bum bummmmm." she pulls the cell from her pocket.}
<C>__{ashley}
<P>__{(re: cell)}
<D>__{it's my mom.}
<P>__{(into cell)}
<D>__{hi. no, i'm fine.}
<P>__{(with a smile)}
<D>__{i'm at barnes and noble. okay, i'm leaving. no, i will walk.}
<A>__{ashley flips the phone shut, joins kale who's watching the lcd screen: dv cam pov giles and the woman are back on the couch. the woman is leaning her head on giles' shoulder. as giles leans forward to take her wine glass, the woman falls over behind him. out cold. kale and ashley cringe.}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{and she's down for the count.}
