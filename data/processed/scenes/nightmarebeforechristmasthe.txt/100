<A>__{no part of the line stands outside now. the few citizens left still waiting for assignments stand...}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior town hall. dusk continuous time.}
<A>__{a very anxious sally stands at the head of the line, in a panic, going over and over what she intends to say:}
<C>__{sally}
<P>__{(almost inaudibly)}
<D>__{jack, you must let go of this insanity... this is a mistake...}
<A>__{behind her the furry behemoth waits patiently.}
<B>__{jack}
<A>__{works with the street band. demonstrating, he shakes a harness piece studded with sleigh bells. the bells jingle cheerfully.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{okay. now you.}
<A>__{the members of the band rattle their bones in response shaking legs and arms, echoing the jingle of the bells, but with their own distinctive hollow clank. jack laughs, enormously pleased.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{perfect!... now let's try this...}
<A>__{using various jingling bells, jack shakes out the tune to "jingle bells." the band clanks the tune right back phrase for phrase.}
<B>__{sally}
<A>__{watches with an increasing sense of doom as her turn with jack nears. jack heartily shakes hands and back slaps the three members of the street band. they head off practicing...}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(calls after)}
<D>__{thanks! you're the absolute best!}
<A>__{he turns to sally who stands frozen, wide eyed, her heart a wild bird trapped in the cage of her chest. he smiles encouragingly at her.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hi. i've saved a really special job for you.}
<A>__{he gestures for her to step closer. stiffly, she does.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(confidentially)}
<D>__{i want you to be the one who makes my sandy claws outfit.}
<A>__{she looks stunned. jack nods eagerly and pats her, mistaking her silence for awe at the responsibility.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i know you can do it.}
<A>__{he enthusiastically proceeds to describe the costume:}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it's bright red, the reddest red you can imagine both the jacket and the pair of pants... the boots are black. there's a big black belt that goes around the middle... oh, and there's white trim on the cuffs and collar.}
<A>__{swallowing hard, sally looks up at him, her wide eyes moist. her voice is tiny.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{are you sure, jack?}
<A>__{jack suddenly looks confused. he stops mid gesture }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{am i sure?}
<A>__{brow furrowing, he stares at the ceiling and thinks. sally holds her breath, hoping... finally, jack shrugs.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well... the trim is traditionally white from everything i've studied, but if you think green would give it more dash... i trust your judgement. i know you'll do a great job. whatever you decide!}
<A>__{at that moment, lock, shock and barrel race in dragging behind them a big sack with something squirming inside!}
<D>__{lock, shock & barrel jack! jack! we caught him! we've got him!}
<B>__{jack}
<A>__{strides excitedly to meet them, leaving sally.}
<B>__{sally}
<A>__{flees, mortified, miserable. she had hoped to help jack, to spare him the pain of his enterprise, to save him from himself... floppy and weak (her legs lost some stuffing in her jump from the evil scientist's window), she runs as best she can, arms and legs pinwheeling... lock, shock & barrel, in a frenzy of giggling, open the big sack and who should jump out but the}
<B>__{easter bunny.}
<A>__{jack's face drops. he turns on the three trick or treaters.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(loud)}
<D>__{that's not sandy claws!}
<C>__{shock}
<D>__{it isn't?}
<C>__{barrel}
<D>__{who is it then?}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{not sandy claws!}
<A>__{the three shrink back.}
<C>__{lock}
<D>__{we followed your instructions.}
<C>__{barrel}
<D>__{we went through the door...}
<C>__{shock}
<D>__{...in the tree.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{which door!?}
<C>__{lock}
<D>__{the door.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well, take him back!}
<A>__{jack turns to the easter bunny and speaks loudly and slowly to him, hoping to be understood.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm very sorry for the inconvenience, sir.}
<A>__{he scowls at the three trick or treaters.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{shall i send somebody else for sandy claws? lock, shock & barrel no!}
<C>__{barrel}
<D>__{not at all!}
<C>__{shock}
<D>__{we can handle it.}
<C>__{lock}
<D>__{we'll get it right this time lock, shock & barrel for sure!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i told you there's more than one door! sandy claws is behind the door shaped like this }
<A>__{he holds up a cut out of a christmas tree.}
<C>__{lock}
<D>__{got it!}
<A>__{they stuff the easter bunny back into the sack and hurry off.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(shouts after them)}
<D>__{take him home first. and apologize again. be careful with sandy claws when you catch him! treat him nicely!}
<A>__{they scurry out the double doors.}
