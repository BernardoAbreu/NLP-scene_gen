<L>__{exterior. salt mountains sunrise}
<A>__{the sunrise depicts two silhouettes, moving across the ridge. lincoln and ester clamber over the calcified rocks. ester now stops to catch her breath. she is wheezing again, fighting for air. as lincoln looks on with concern, she musters a brave smile }
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{i can make it.}
<L>__{exterior. salt canyon early morning}
<A>__{a freight barge whooshes through the canyon, trailing a chain of low, arched containers, capacious in width rather than height. the conveyance is similar to a lodeway but wider, deeper, known as a "lode canal". at each end of the canyon, it intersects with other lode canals, converging to use the same passage, a system of signals and lockgates controlling the flow of freight traffic. high above, on the south rim of the canyon, we find lincoln and ester. ester is no longer wheezing but rasping. she looks down at the passing vessel, daunted. lincoln offers her small comfort }
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{don't worry. the one we want goes the other way. he said it goes slower.}
<A>__{they exchange a smile. the chain of containers tailing off, the barge leaving the canyon with a blast of its resonant claxon.}
