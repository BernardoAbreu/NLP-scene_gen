<L>__{exterior berk village day}
<A>__{(scene 2700 a new beginning) a sheep grazes lazily on the grass as a terrible terror struggles in vain to carry him off. suddenly, both are snatched up by a passing dragon.}
<B>__{in the air}
<A>__{ruffnut and tuffnut wrestle over the sheep atop barf & belch. ruffnut send the sheep flying toward fishlegs. snotlout nabs it instead, blowing a kiss mockingly.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{this... is berk. a bit trampled and busted and covered in ice, but it's home. it's our home.}
<A>__{they swoop past a gathered crowd on the battered bleachers as snotlout dunks the sheep in his basket. eret joins the race atop skullcrusher. they fly past hiccup and toothless, who are steadily hoisting a palette of timber and supplies onto a rooftop where workers are rebuilding the damaged houses. hiccup then turns his attention to a massive statue of stoick, presently under construction. he grins with pride.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{those who attacked us are relentless and crazy. but those who stopped them? oh, even more so!}
<A>__{he looks to the horizon, scanning it from east to west to ensure that no trouble is approaching. astrid and stormfly buzz past him playfully, coaxing him to join the game. he smiles.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{we may be small in numbers, but we stand for something bigger than anything the world can pit against us.}
<A>__{astrid soars past the blacksmith stall, waving to valka and gobber as they remove the armor from drago's freed battle dragons.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{we are the voice of peace. and bit by bit, we will change this world.}
<A>__{realizing that he's late, gobber hurries over to the sheep launcher and pulls the trigger, sending the black sheep hurtling into the air. astrid and stormfly close in on the black sheep, about to snatch it out of the air, when suddenly, hiccup and toothless dart past, beating them to it. toothless looks back with a gummy smile.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{you see, we have something they don't. oh sure, they have armies and they have armadas...}
<A>__{toothless and hiccup dive toward the line of baskets. as they approach, toothless bounces hiccup into the air, allowing him to dunk the black sheep into astrid's basket. they reunite on the other side. the crowd cheers!}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{but we... we have...}
<A>__{hiccup and toothless land upon the chief's dais, joined by astrid, stormfly, and the other dragon riders.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{our dragons!}
<A>__{toothless lets out a proud roar as hiccup look out over berk, gleaming with pride.}
