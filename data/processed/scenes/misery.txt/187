<A>__{out in the hallway, on his way toward the kitchen, paul notices a door to his right. he wheels over and surprisingly it opens. however, this is not a door to the outside of the house, only a storage pantry. he looks around nothing but canned goods, potato chips, cereals and large plastic coke containers, etc. just as he is about to close the door, he notices an open cardboard box. he opens the flap and sees all kinds of prescription drugs. among them are a couple of strips of novril encapsulated in blisters. he grabs them and stuffs them into his sweatpants. now he closes the pantry door and heads to the kitchen.}
