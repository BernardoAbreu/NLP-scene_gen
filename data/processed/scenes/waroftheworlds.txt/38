<L>__{interior harland's house basement dusk}
<A>__{ray and rachel are sleeping on the couch. as we view down from ray's face we find that rachel is wide awake for some reason. she sits up and....}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(screams) ahhhh!!!}
<A>__{a robot camera is 1' away from her face. rachel runs to the wall, still screaming as ray hit's the camera with his hands. the camera hit's the ceiling and shakes it's self off of debris. ray begins blasting the axe he had in hand into the camera attachment line. rachel screams as he hit's the line. over and over and over. rachel runs up the basement stairs. ray continues hitting it and it finally pulls away. the camera, still attached by a hair, hits some wood planks and is pulled out of the hole.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{rachel???}
<A>__{no response for a few seconds, then rachel lets off a gut wrenching scream.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{rachel!!! (to himself) oh, my god, no!}
<A>__{he runs up the stairs to search for her in the house.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{rachel? rachel? (looks up the stairs)}
<D>__{rachel??}
<A>__{ray opens the front door to find red vines coated in blood in the doorway. he quickly brushes them down stepping out the door.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(searching) rachel, make some noise}
<D>__{baby. rachel??}
<A>__{he begins walking down a path to look for her farther out.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{rachel? rachel? talk to me baby, come on!}
<A>__{he gets no response from rachel. all is dead silent accept for him.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{rachel?!? rachel?!?!?!}
<A>__{ray sees an entire field of blood coated red vines beyond the hill.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{rachel!!!! rachel!!!}
<A>__{a robot's lights turn on to him as a food lands close enough to him to blow him back. one of the robot's grabbing claws comes after ray. he hides in a truck. the claw breaks through the glass, grabs the car, and flips it, causing it to roll about 3 times.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(screams) ahh!}
<A>__{now in the car, lying upside down, he hears rachel scream. he looks and rachel is standing at the top of a hill. the robot centers above her and begins to grab her with a claw. ray runs towards her to try and do what he can to stop it.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(screams) ahhhhh!!!!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{no no no!!!}
<A>__{the robot blasts through a building. ray is right behind the foot. he runs into an army vehicle and finds a belt full of grenades. he takes on off, removes the pin and throws it at the robot.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{hey!!!}
<A>__{it hit's the robot's shields and the robot turns right around. it eyeballs ray for a moment and picks him up by a grabbing claw.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(screams in pain) ahhh!}
<A>__{he is thrown into a cage with about 30 other people in it as well. the gate closes on the top as he is thrown in. the camera shows he is in one of two cages. people scream and cry in confusion. ray spots rachel sitting on the side of the grate.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{rachel!!}
<A>__{he goes towards her just as the door opens, it makes a sound and a grabbing claw comes out of a hole on the robot. ray falls down (luckily), it grabs another person and sucks him into the ship. the same happens in the other cage.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(reaching rachel) rachel. (no response)}
<D>__{rachel.}
<A>__{she seems to be frozen.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{rachel.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{dad?}
<A>__{ray goes to speak just as boom! the grate shifts, tossing all the people around and the door opens to take another person up. ray ducks down with rachel but this is noticed by the grabbing claw. he is swept up by it. rachel holds on to his neck to go with him. but then, ray sees his belt of grenades. he prigs rachel's hands off of him and grabs the grenades. a soldier sees this and latches onto ray's arm.}
<C>__{soldier 2}
<D>__{pull me! pull me!!!}
<A>__{people all start latching on to the soldier and begin heaving him and ray down. they loose ground until more people join.}
<C>__{soldier 2}
<D>__{we got him! keep pulling! pull me!}
<A>__{ray is let loose by the clamp and they all fall back into the cage. ray spits out two grenade pins out of his mouth. this is seen by the soldier.}
<C>__{soldier 2}
<D>__{everybody down!!!}
<A>__{hardly anybody gets down as the inside of the robot explodes. we can see the robot exploding on the inside. it breaks doors and fluid stars spilling out of it. the robot releases it's cages and they fall into a tree. splitting open. people promptly climb out. once the robot falls to the ground, rachel looks at ray in a way that meant how did you do that. boston city limits freeway day ray walks with rachel down the road as soldiers are ushering them to "keep moving." the crows are now eating the red plant which appears to be dying rapidly. ray picks up a piece, of dead plant.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{what happened to it?}
<A>__{ray crumples the plant in his hand. it turns to dust and blows away.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{it's dying.}
<A>__{watching the dust, they walk along to find a robot lying half struck into a building.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{soldier 3}
<D>__{i don't know, something's happening to them. please keep moving.}
<A>__{ray goes up to another soldier for information.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{something's happening to them?}
<C>__{soldier 4}
<D>__{go. go. just keep moving, sir.}
<A>__{ray asks another soldier down the road for information.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{excuse me, excuse me, what happened here? you guys take it down?}
<C>__{soldier 5}
<D>__{no sir, it was behaving erratically, walking in circles then it went down}
<P>__{on it's own about an hour ago. (to people)}
<D>__{now let's keep moving, don't stop do not stop! keep moving!}
<A>__{rachel and ray are walking down the road with soldiers and other people.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{how is it dead all by it's self?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{rachel, i'm not sure.}
<A>__{seeing another robot, one soldier motions to get into the water tunnel. other soldiers make signals to get set up for defense if necessary. everyone gets into the tunnel. a soldier can be heard telling everyone "calm down and get in the tunnel". ray notices that birds are flying over and landing on the robot. the robot's shields are down. as he goes to tell someone, the robot makes the viberating sound.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(to a soldier, during the robot noise)}
<D>__{look at the birds!!!}
<C>__{soldier 6}
<D>__{i can't hear you!!!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{look at the birds!!!}
<C>__{soldier 6}
<D>__{i can't hear you!!}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(louder) look at the god damn birds!!!}
<A>__{the soldier looks at them and doesn't get what ray's getting at. he looks back at ray. the noise continues erratically as if the robot is fighting to stay alive.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{no shields!!!}
<C>__{soldier 6}
<P>__{(motions and says) i can't hear you!!!}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(pointing) no shields!!!}
<C>__{soldier 6}
<P>__{(now getting it) (to the soldiers) the}
<D>__{javelin's the key! load the gustav, it's gonna be a tough kill!!! let's go!!!}
<A>__{ray gets in the tunnel as all the soldiers come running out.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(to the people in the tunnel and rachel)}
<D>__{it's safer in here!}
<C>__{soldier 6}
<D>__{lets go!!! brign out the javelin!!!}
<A>__{soldiers scurry to get set up and they hurriedly fire missiles at the robot. the first missile hit's the grabbing claws and knocks them off. a few more shots and the robot collapses into a nearby factory. the factory explodes and the robot grinds to a halt on the ground. they check it to be clear as an alien falls out of the door. it quickly dies on site.}
<C>__{soldier 6}
<D>__{it's clear!}
<A>__{we watch the alien turn to stone as it dies. boston walking down street near mary ann's mother's house day mary ann walks up to the front door and sees ray walking down the street with rachel in his arms. she flutters open the doors and she and rachel run towards each other on the street. mary ann begins crying.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{mom!!!}
<A>__{they hug each other crying. mary ann looks at ray who is still standing in the middle of the street.}
<C>__{mary ann}
<P>__{(just barely hearable) thank you.}
<A>__{mary ann's parents come out of the door. the mother has a shocked look on her face. tim is behind them. ray's eyes and face perk up as we see robbie coming down the front steps towards him.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{robbie?}
<A>__{ray and robbie take a good look at each other and robbie finally mutters with a dry throat.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{hey dad!}
<A>__{they hug each other in thankfulness for each other's survival. screenshot of a germ in a water droplet on a bud on a tree}

<D>__{from the moment the invaders arrived, breathed our air, ate and drank, they were doomed. they were undone, destroyed, after all of man's weapons and devices had failed, by the tiniest creatures that god and his wisdom, put upon this earth. at the toll of a billion deaths, man had earned his immunity, is right to survive among this planet's infinite organisms. and that right is ours against all challenges, for men do not live nor die in vein.}
