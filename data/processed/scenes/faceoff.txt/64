<P>__{(sickened)}
<D>__{jesus, what a life.}
<A>__{castor tries to catch a street address and rolls past... archer's house dressed for work, eve watches blandly as the car goes by. a moment later, it backs up and parks. hiding the beer can, castor forces a sheepish smile and gets out. she doesn't smile back.}
