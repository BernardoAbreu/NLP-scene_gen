<A>__{...ten feet onto the window cleaning platform. catwoman uses her bladed heel to cut a rope the platform plunges down the side of the building.}

<A>__{catwoman dumps daggett onto the roof, towering over him.}
<C>__{catwoman}
<D>__{where is it?}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{the 'clean slate'? type in a name and date of birth and within a couple hours that person ceases to exist in any database? little too good to be true.}
<C>__{catwoman}
<D>__{you're lying. rykin data took it to prototype stage }
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{that's why i bought them. but they had nothing. it was a gangland myth.}
<A>__{catwoman leans back from daggett, taking this in... shapes drop onto the rooftop. emerge from fire exits. they're not daggett's bodyguards, these are bane's men... catwoman holds daggett by the throat, threatening him.}
<C>__{catwoman}
<D>__{stay back!}
<A>__{they continue to approach. one of them screws a silencer onto his gun.}
<C>__{catwoman}
<D>__{i'm not bluffing!}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{they know...}
<A>__{all eyes search for the source of the voice. catwoman spots it a dark shape, crouched on the roof above: batman.}
<C>__{batman}
<D>__{they just don't care.}
<A>__{as the mercenary with the silencer looks up, catwoman leaps forward, grabs his gun. batman drops into the middle of the fray, fighting back mercenaries at catwoman's back she fires at one, clipping him, he drops. she spins aiming at another's head batman yanks her arm down, forcing her to miss the mercenary. batman takes him out with a kick.}
<C>__{catwoman}
<D>__{you've got to be kidding.}
<C>__{batman}
<D>__{no guns. no killing.}
<C>__{catwoman}
<D>__{where's the fun in that?}
<A>__{as more mercenaries come out onto the roof, batman runs for the far edge.}
<C>__{batman}
<D>__{come on!}
<A>__{catwoman follows, confused, as batman leaps off the roof. she gets to the edge, pauses to look down into the alley sees the black angular roof of the bat, cockpit open. shots impact around her she leaps, landing hard, but gracefully on the back of the vehicle, slides into the cockpit. as the engines thunder into life, and the canopy hisses shut, taking bullets from above.}
<C>__{catwoman}
<D>__{my mother warned me about getting into cars with strange men }
<C>__{batman}
<D>__{this isn't a car.}
<A>__{catwoman flinches as the bat thunders into the sky, downdraft forcing the mercenaries down onto the roof, all but one, who walks slowly across the roof, strong against the wind...bane. he watches the bat roar off into the night.}
