<C>__{jack}
<D>__{christmastime is buzzing in my skull. will it let me be? i cannot tell. there're so many things i cannot grasp... when i think i've got it, then at last through my bony fingers it does slip like a snowflake in a fiery grip. something's here i'm not quite getting though i try, i keep forgetting like a memory long since past here in an instant, gone in a flash... what does it mean? what does it mean? in these little bric a brac, a secret waiting to be cracked. these dolls and toys confuse me so... confound it all i love it though! simple objects nothing more but something's hidden through the door. though i do not have the key, something's there i cannot see. what does it mean? what does it mean? i've read these christmas books so many times i know the stories and i know the rhymes i know the christmas carols all by heart... my skull's so full, it's tearing me apart. as often as i read them, something's wrong... so hard to put my bony finger on...}
<A>__{a thought strikes jack. he takes a new tack... he whirls around, singing...}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{or perhaps it's really not as deep as i've been led to think. am i trying much too hard...? of course! i've been too close to see! the answer's right in front of me! it's simple really, very clear, like music drifting in the air invisible but everywhere. just because i cannot see it doesn't mean i can't believe it.}
<A>__{enthusiasm takes the place of torment. joy lightens jack's tortured soul.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{you know i think this christmas thing it's not as tricky as it seems. and why should they have all the fun? it should belong to anyone... not anyone, in fact, but me! why, i could make a christmas tree. and there's no reason i can find that i couldn't handle christmastime. i bet i could improve it too! and that's exactly what i will do!}
