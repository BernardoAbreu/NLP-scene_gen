<L>__{exterior whale's house day}
<A>__{clay fetches a pair of hedge clippers from his truck. he can't help stopping by the side view mirror to look at his face.}
<L>__{interior examination room day}
<A>__{doctors and technicians flash lights into whale's eyes... test his reflexes...inject him with radioactive isotope. whale sits very still with his head behind a fluoroscope screen while two doctors murmur over the image.}
<L>__{interior doctor's office day}
<A>__{a pair of x rays are slapped wet on a light board. two skulls, one facing forward, the other in profile. dr. payne, a bland young neurologist, points to a smudge in the side view x ray.}
<C>__{dr. payne}
<D>__{this is the area of infarction. by which we mean the portion of brain affected by the stroke.}
<A>__{the venetian blinds of the examining room are closed. whale sits calmly, flanneled legs crossed at the knees, gazing at his own skull.}
<C>__{dr. payne}
<D>__{you're a lucky man, mr. whale. whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{yes, yes, dr. payne. but from the neck up? what's my story there?}
<C>__{dr. payne}
<D>__{that's what i'm trying to explain.}
<A>__{payne turns off the light board and goes to the venetian blinds. the room is instantly full of sun.}
<C>__{dr. payne}
<D>__{the central nervous system selects items from a constant storm of sensations. whatever was killed in your stroke appears to have short circuited this mechanism. parts of your brain now seem to be firing at random.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?}
<C>__{dr. payne}
<D>__{that's as good a way as any to describe it. i've seen far worse cases. you might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{but the rest of it? the killing headaches. the phantom smells. my inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. it's all nothing more than bad electricity?}
<C>__{dr. payne}
<D>__{in a manner of speaking. i've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but i'm sure they're related.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{so what do i do?}
<C>__{dr. payne}
<D>__{take the luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you seem to be saying that this isn't just a case of resting until i'm better. that my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life.}
<A>__{the doctor responds with a sympathetic gaze. whale nods solemnly.}
