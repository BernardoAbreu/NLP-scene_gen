<A>__{irene, sitting in her car outside jerome's condominium, hangs up her portable phone. in her agitation, her finger involuntarily goes to her pulse. she catches herself and removes the finger from her wrist as if it has burned her. she exits the car.}
<L>__{interior jerome's condominium eugene's condominium. night.}
<A>__{irene quietly knocks on jerome's door but there is no response. trying the handle, the door opens. her curiosity takes her inside. all is quiet. irene calls out.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{no reply. irene hesitantly ventures further, drawn to the spiral staircase. she tentatively makes her way down the stairs and into eugene's dimly lit condominium. with wonder and reverence, she examines the instruments and samples laid out on eugene's work benches. she opens the refrigerator in the bathroom and inspects the samples and sachets. finally she regards the empty incinerator.}
<C>__{eugene }
<D>__{quite something, isn't it?}
<A>__{irene turns. eugene has entered through the mirrored door, not at all displeased by her unexpected visit.}
<C>__{eugene}
<P>__{(referring to the incinerator)}
<D>__{that's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{i've been looking for him. do you know where he is?}
<C>__{eugene}
<P>__{(unconcerned)}
<D>__{he's probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes.}
<A>__{eugene idly inspects one of the blood sachets.}
<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{don't be deceived, irene. these are just the clothes. he has to wear them. something i could never do.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{what's wrong with him?}
<C>__{eugene}
<P>__{(sympathetic smile)}
<D>__{you have more in common than you know.}
<A>__{irene's hand involuntarily goes to her heart.}
<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{but they say}
<A>__{his is already ten thousand beats}
<D>__{overdue. i have my doubts.}
<P>__{(wry smile)}
<D>__{for all my gifts, they could never engineer me a heart like vincent's.}
<A>__{irene turns back to the incinerator, lost in though.}
