<L>__{interior comms room day}
<A>__{sam sitting before the monitor. he hits the "play" button, begins watching the message. on the monitor: tess is sitting in a living room talking to sam. tess has a sweet voice, she sounds grounded, like she's got a head on her shoulders.}
<C>__{tess}
<D>__{hi sam. it's me. how are you?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{i got your last message, it was really great to hear your voice. i know you've been really lonely up there, but in a lot of ways it's been good for you, i think. i hope you don't mind me saying that. i'm proud of you.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{hey, someone's got something to say.}
<A>__{a woman, possibly a nanny or some form of hired help, swings a little girl into tess's arms. this is eve, sam and tess's daughter.}
<C>__{tess }
<D>__{eve, it's daddy. what did you want to say to him?}
<A>__{eve just stares. tess whispers to her ("remember what we practiced", etc.) finally eve attempts:}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{asstraut.}
<C>__{tess}
<D>__{who's an astronaut?}
<P>__{(encouraging)}
<D>__{go on!}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{daddy asstraut!}
<A>__{tess laughs. so does sam.}
<C>__{tess}
<D>__{that's right, daddy's an astronaut. clever girl!}
<A>__{eve fidgets, rubs her nose, distracted.}
<C>__{tess }
<D>__{she's shy. uh, cathy, could you...?}
<A>__{the maid steps in, hoists eve away. tess waits until they're out of earshot.}
<C>__{tess }
<D>__{it's her birthday next month. i thought we'd get her a play house for the garden. we could even pick it out together.}
<A>__{a pause. tess just stares into the camera. she is hundreds and thousands of miles away, but for a second it feels like she's right there in the comms room with sam. it's intimate. she finally shakes her head, self conscious, shy.}
<C>__{tess }
<D>__{god, i hate these things. sam, i love you. i'm thinking of you always. i can't wait to see you, sweetheart. okay. bye.}
<A>__{and the message ends. on sam: smiling, on the brink of tears.}
