<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{guard uniforms, exactly like those we've just seen, worn by the nomad's security staff. maroon with burnished gold buttons and brown piping down the slacks. three separate vestments laid out across the trunk of a rental car.}
<T>__{camera pulls back to reveal:}
<L>__{exterior parking lot off the lake day}
<A>__{dupree and deeks in an empty parking lot, bundled up in windbreakers, battling the frozen spindrift swirling in off the lake.}
<C>__{dupree}
<D>__{same place that rents the guard's uniforms. there's a shift change at 9am. graveyard goes home and we can blend in with the day shift coming on.}
<C>__{deeks}
<D>__{what about access cards? pass keys?}
<C>__{dupree}
<D>__{we'll have to get our hands on them. there's two separate units; casino floor count room security and general hotel security }
<P>__{(annoyed, nods to car)}
<D>__{does he want to hear this or what?}
<A>__{deeks bangs on the hood of the car.}
<C>__{deeks}
<D>__{hollis!}
<A>__{elmore steps out, moving slowly to the rear of the car.}
<C>__{dupree}
<D>__{nobody put a gun to your head.}
<A>__{elmore leans against the bumper, bored.}
<C>__{elmore}
<D>__{yeah, we've been through that.}
<C>__{dupree}
<D>__{then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl. reed just gave us fifty grand.}
<C>__{elmore}
<D>__{ jack, what am i doing? i'm standing here, aren't i?}
<P>__{(beat, to both men)}
<D>__{shouldn't that be enough? that i made the trip?}
<C>__{dupree}
<D>__{your attitude sucks.}
<C>__{elmore}
<D>__{i been accused of worse.}
<P>__{(glancing at uniforms)}
<D>__{what do we got...?}
<A>__{dupree, dubious, does he continue...? fine. fuck it.}
<C>__{dupree}
<D>__{two security levels, the one we're going in under the guise of, hotel security, has restricted access. they're mostly there to monitor the lobby, handle disturbances on the different floors and toss out drunks.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{there's a thirty five member employee rotation going from graveyard to day shift. if we split up, we can blend in and enter unnoticed. once we're inside the hotel, we'll regroup.}
<C>__{elmore}
<D>__{then what }
<A>__{ a plymouth barracuda passes by, brakes hard, reverses. the trio stop talking, look over...and then their lives end. bad intentions blaze from the driver's side, machine gun bursts dupree is hit flush, dead on his feet, his dying thought, cut comically short; "i had that car in high scho deeks, shredded where he stands, his body absorbing a fusillade of rounds traveling at twice the speed of sound. one creases elmore's skull, another blows out deeks' back, fragmenting, claiming three fingers from elmore's left hand. the three of them fall in weird, waterlogged flops, no dying breaths, no death rattles, just lights out...just like that. several seconds pass. then the car door opens and the tremor brothers, like circus clowns, clamber out in a cloud of gun and reefer smoke. lester tremor, the dandruff caked, pockmarked middle brother is the first out. he shakes off the cold, yawning, stretching, revealing all manner of tattoo. the tremors' youngest brother, the baby huey sized jeeves tremor bumbles out, pulling at his crotch. he unzips & rips, baptizing the cuda's tire with a truly prodigious piss. darwin tremor climbs from the car, the eldest brother, straw boss, brains of the outfit. he looks down at the dead men, seems saddened by their state. some remorse maybe? maybe so.}
<C>__{jeeves tremor}
<P>__{(still pissing)}
<D>__{luvin' that, rat tat tat tat, clean as a nun's snatch on kristal nacht!}
<C>__{lester tremor}
<P>__{(stops singing)}
<D>__{shut up fuckass, them spirits ain't vacated yet, s'keep quiet.}
<C>__{jeeves tremor}
<D>__{them spirts can kiss my chinese ass.}
<C>__{lester tremor}
<D>__{...you ain't no chinese!}
<A>__{this exchange prompts jeeves to turn and urinate on lester. lester squeals war cry, launching a wild windmill barrage on his behemoth little brother. jeeves ignores the hydrant like urine stream soaking them both and starts swinging back. darwin kneels down over the dead jack dupree, taking jack's face in his hand and squeezing back and forth, adding his own words in what amounts to a freakish ventriloquist act.}
<C>__{dupree }
<D>__{...i forgive you darwin.}
<C>__{darwin tremor}
<D>__{shoot, i appreciate that man.}
<C>__{dupree}
<D>__{if i needed your i.d. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, i woulda killed you to get 'em too.}
<C>__{darwin tremor}
<D>__{you woulda?}
<C>__{dupree}
<D>__{oh hell yeah. we's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. so don't feel so bad dude.}
<C>__{darwin tremor}
<D>__{damn...alright then.}
<C>__{dupree}
<D>__{i don't mind now anyway.}
<C>__{dupree }
<D>__{you know, up here in heaven, it's beautiful. way better than fuckin' hawaii or any place like that.}
<A>__{darwin's eyes begin to well, the tears coming slowly. in the background, lester and jeeves beat e ach other ruthlessly.}
<C>__{darwin tremor}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{dupree}
<D>__{i'm glad i'm here. i love it. i'm gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with jesus and them.}
<A>__{darwin wipes his eyes.}
<C>__{darwin tremor}
<D>__{man, that's great.}
<C>__{dupree}
<D>__{i got it made in the shade amigo. hey, i will see you up here some day, don't worry.}
<C>__{darwin tremor}
<D>__{you think so?}
<A>__{darwin uses his thumb and forefinger to make it appear as though dupree we're smiling up at him.}
<C>__{dupree}
<D>__{i know so.}
<A>__{darwin smiles back down at the corpse, wiping his nose on his sleeve. he reaches down and pulls out dupree's wallet. he spots the bondsman's license, eyeballs the bail papers: he sees the name robert israel in bold type. puts it together.}
<C>__{darwin tremor}
<D>__{damn jack...you was after the same sacka shit as us...small world.}
<A>__{darwin continues the pat down, pauses, pulls the envelope with fifty grand inside, fingers fresh bills. with his free hand he manipulates dupree's dead mouth one last time.}
<C>__{dupree}
<D>__{don't tell your asshole brothers you know about it, that money is for you old boy.}
<A>__{darwin, a nod of acknowledgement for the dead dupree.}
<C>__{darwin tremor}
<D>__{i appreciate that pard...i wish i coulda been a better friend.}
<A>__{darwin stands, his eyes move to the guard's uniforms, still laid out across the trunk...he looks over at his two brothers, jeeves now with a lenny like hammerlock on lester's head.}
<D>__{darwin tremor (contd) (cont'd) alright enough grabassin' goddamit! we need t'get over t'that hotel.}
<C>__{watters }
<D>__{we're already here baby.}
