<L>__{exterior front porch dining area a little later}
<A>__{jane nervously nibbles on her fingernail as the family sits silently around the table watching a ravenous jake eat french toast, bacon, coffee, side of fruit. his mood has been lifted. his energy is in full bloom.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{mommy's the best cook in the world!}
<L>__{exterior vegetable garden later that day}
<A>__{jane is working in the garden. a shadow falls over her. she looks up, jake stands before her, a cute smile breaking across his face.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{thank you for saving me janey.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{jake, you knew the kids were all here. shouldn't we have talked about this? agreed this was the right thing to do? this is so typical. only thinking about works for you.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i guess i should've called before showing up.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{ and i'm not sure you even left agness. maybe she saw something last night and threw you out...}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{what's the difference? i was drowning over there. i'm not going to get that many more chances in my life to figure myself out. janey, let's use these couple of days to see if we can make this work.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{we can't, jake. i told you this the other night. please listen.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{but you were all pissy because you thought i stood you up. things are different now. i'm a free man.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{can we just hug? i hate that you're being so distant. it's literally giving me a pain in my stomach.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{oh, god...}
<A>__{jane reluctantly hugs him. he tries to kiss her.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{see! too much!}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{okay! good note.}
<A>__{jane can't help but smile.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{can i help with what you're doing? hold your basket or...}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i'm fine....}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{okay... i'm going to go to the video store and get us all a dvd to watch tonight. we'll have movie night. just like old times. how's that? i will make the popcorn.}
<A>__{just then jane's cell rings.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{fine.}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{hello...}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{i love knowing i'm coming back here.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(nods, turning slightly)}
<D>__{oh, hi... i slept great. how `bout you?}
<A>__{jake waits, but realizes jane's not going to turn back.}
