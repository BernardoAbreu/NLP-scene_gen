<A>__{abby is coming through the screen door. the room is strikingly bare of everything except furniture. all personal effects have been removed. abby looks around, bewildered, as ray enters from the hallway.}

<D>__{...the truth is... he was alive when i buried him.}
<A>__{abby stares. an object materializes in the sky beyond them. it is flipping end over end in slow motion, moving toward abby and ray and the screen door. abby and ray, each staring at the other, fail to notice until thwack it bounces off the screen. abby starts; ray doesn't. the spell is broken, abby pushes hesitantly at the screen door. ray's hand slides off the cross slat; he makes no move to stop her.}
<B>__{close shot the front stoop}
<A>__{as abby steps over the rolled up newspaper that hit the screen door.}
<B>__{tracking shot on abby}
<A>__{hurrying down the driveway to get to her car. a low rumble is building on the soundtrack. abby glances at ray's car as she passes it. abby's pov tracking forward the car more blood has seeped into and dried on the dropsheet covering the back seat. the bass rumble grows louder, punctuated by a rhythmic thumping.}
