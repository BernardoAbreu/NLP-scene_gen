<L>__{interior mutchie's bar night}
<A>__{in lower manhattan. there are six or eight matrons still there, stevedores and truck drivers. most of them are clustered at the far end of the bar, where mutchie, a gray haired gone to paunch irishman with spectacles as thick as pop bottle bottoms stands behind the mahogany bar. the cluster of customers is involved in a typical new york saloon argument. doyle is ignoring the debate and watching the television. he is approached by a small man in a long coat and baggy suit with suspenders. this is jesus the booster.}
<C>__{jesus}
<D>__{hey, bo.}
<C>__{doyle}

<A>__{jesus blends into the crowd and we pick up the dialogue of mutchie and his cronies, bad eddie, lee and puggy.}
<C>__{mutchie}
<D>__{a big man could alluz beat a little man. that's why wilt chamberlain could murder jim brown if they ever fought.}
<C>__{bad eddie}
<D>__{no chance. brown'd kill him.}
<C>__{mutchie}
<D>__{chamberlain's seven foot tall, right? he's got a twelve foot reach. it's geophysics. he's punchin' down on you with leverage. he cave your chest in.}
<C>__{bad eddie}
<D>__{best i ever seen was the rock. he was the calmest and the meanest. guys like sugar'd be pukin' before a fight. jake lamotta'd be pukin'. marciano was calm like he was goin' to church. what about the night he fought lastarza? he hit him so hard he broke the blood vessels in lastarza's arms. he was the strongest meanest bastard ever lived.}
<C>__{puggy}

<C>__{puggy}
<D>__{ he was a stone tanker.}
<C>__{mutchie}
<D>__{that's right, he couldn't fight legit. one night at the garden about 1950, '51 he fought either jake lamotta or gus lesnevich, i think it was he took one o' those cream puff punches in the sixth the laziest left you ever seen missed him entirely. down goes blackjack without even workin' up a sweat and the whole garden gets up in its feet and i swear to christ, everybody starts singin' "dance with me henry."}
<C>__{lee}

<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{i hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer. i come by to help you carry out your money.}
<C>__{mutchie}
<D>__{they'll close you down if they ever get a look at those busted valise broads you run with.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{you want some eggs.}
<C>__{mutchie}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{doyle}
<P>__{(looking around for bacon)}
<D>__{hey, mutch! you want bacon?}
<C>__{mutchie}

<C>__{doyle}
<P>__{(rattling pans, looking around)}
<D>__{where the hell is it?}
<C>__{mutchie}
<D>__{where the hell do you think it is, potato head?}
<A>__{doyle opens the door to the icebox.}
<C>__{mutchie}
<D>__{no wonder there's so many mafia around. ya couldn't find a puerto rican in spanish harlem.}
<A>__{time lapse. almost morning. close on doyle and mutchie eating bacon and eggs. mutchie is standing behind the bar as he eats, doyle is sitting in front of it. they both have a bottle of beer.}
<C>__{mutchie}
<D>__{i got this little chick i'm tryin' to hit on. she's about 20, 21... i take her to jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... i says, "hey, this is 1971, baby, i'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{strike out, eh?}
<C>__{mutchie}
<D>__{yeah. in the late innings. ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.}

<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{morning. sometime.}
<C>__{mutchie}
<D>__{whyn't ya stretch out on the pool table for a couple hours. the kid comes in at six will wake ya. a couple eggs and a beer is cheaper than keepin' a dog around the jointerior}
