<A>__{in the hallway, the shiny doorknob leading to amy's bedroom is the only reflecting surface that has been forgotten. in the distorted reflection, we see michael's silhouette approaching. the little boy reaches for the knob but in reality, no hand touches it it's michael's reflection inside the shiny knob that is opening the door! inside the bedroom, amy fell asleep with daisy in her arms. on the bedside table, the home phone starts ringing she wakes up with a jolt and picks up the cordless receiver }
