<L>__{interior viktor's soundstage day}
<A>__{elaine and the executives stop in their tracks confronted with the surreal sight of the lone computer station in the vast soundstage. a desperate viktor catches up with them.}
<C>__{executive 1}
<D>__{where is she?}
<C>__{executive 2}
<D>__{she's not here.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{elaine... i...}
<A>__{elaine wanders over to the idle computer with a knowing smile.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{so, the secret's finally out, viktor.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{ i can explain.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{ i don't think that's necessary. i think it's perfectly clear. i should have guessed it all makes sense now... it's why she never goes anywhere, never seen in public...}
<A>__{viktor lowers his head, resigned to his fate.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{she's into computers.}
<A>__{viktor looks up.}
<C>__{executive 1}
<P>__{(nodding in agreement)}
<D>__{probably spends her whole life in chat rooms.}
<C>__{executive 2}
<D>__{it's the one place she can be herself.}
<C>__{executive 3}
<D>__{anonymous.}
<A>__{viktor seizes on the opportunity.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(adopting a serious tone)}
<D>__{it's worse than you think. she's extremely agoraphobic has a morbid fear of people and germs. in a way i'm relieved you... found out.}
<A>__{the executives are taken aback by the shocking revelation.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{the premiere was the first time i've convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst nightmares.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(concerned)}
<D>__{viktor, you should have said something.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{she doesn't want pity.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(seeing a new side of viktor)}
<D>__{you're so good to protect her like this.}
<A>__{viktor shrugs modestly.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(to the executives, conceding)}
<D>__{i will tell you what. i know how much this means to you. i will try to get her to plug the film.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm not promising anything but maybe she'll do a talk show taped.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{oh, make it live please, viktor.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{i will try. maybe live but remote. she'll never go to them.}
<C>__{executive 1}
<D>__{we understand. thank you, viktor.}
<C>__{executive 2}
<D>__{give her our best.}
<A>__{satisfied, the executives make their way out of the soundstage.}
<C>__{executive 1}
<P>__{(aside to a colleague)}
<D>__{that agoraphobia it's like a plague.}
<C>__{executive 2}
<D>__{it's out of control in europe.}
<A>__{viktor and elaine are left alone.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{i'm sorry i didn't get a chance to introduce you to simone at the premiere. there wasn't time with the riot and everything.}
<P>__{(picking up a framed photo from the work station)}
<D>__{but she wanted you to have this.}
<A>__{the photograph shows elaine, slightly inebriated at the premiere, simone standing slightly behind her.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{she was there. she didn't by any chance happen to mention me?}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{she said you were very beautiful.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(flattered)}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(blurting out)}
<D>__{elaine, what are you doing tonight? would you like to go somewhere dinner?}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{i'd love to. but aren't you supposed to meet up with simone?}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{oh, yes. of course. don't i always?}
<A>__{viktor watches elaine make her way back to her studio cart. viktor realizes he is still holding a copy of the national echo the headline, "million dollar reward for photo of simone"! accompanied by a photo of intrepid reporter max}
