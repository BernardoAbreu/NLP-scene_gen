<L>__{ext desert magic hour}
<A>__{they pull up at a huge desert stone formation, a canopy of white sandstone with vermillion streaks swirling through it looming over them like a giant oyster shell. wyatt dismounts, helping josephine. he takes his long duster from his saddle and lays it on a wide, table shaped rock for them to sit on.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{that was lovely!}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{you know you almost got us both killed back there?}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{fun though, wasn't it?}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{you'd die for fun?}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{wouldn't you? you're laughing! i was sure you never laughed.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{i laugh sometimes}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{yes, but how often? tell me, are you happy?}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{am i happy? i don't know. happy as the next man, i guess. i don't laugh all day long like an idiot, if that's what you mean.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{you're a little touchy about it.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{i'm not touchy, i just, it's a silly question, that's all. am i happy? are you happy?}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{of course, i'm always happy. unless i'm bored. that blonde woman, is that your wife?}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{what about her?}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{nothing... tell me, what do you want out of life?}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{where do you get these questions?}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{just answer.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{i don't know, make some money, have some kids, you know.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{doesn't suit you.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{how would you know?}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{just doesn't, that's all.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{well i ought to know my own mind and i'm tellin' you what suits me is a family and kids. that suits me right down to the ground. in fact, that's my idea of heaven.}
<P>__{(pauses)}
<D>__{all right, what's your idea of heaven?}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{room service.}
<A>__{wyatt laughs, almost in spite of himself. josephine beams.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{see? you're laughing again. but that's what i want. go places and move and never look back and just have fun. forever. that's my idea of heaven. need someone to share it with, though.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{you mean behan?}
<P>__{(sees her shrug)}
<D>__{then why are you with him?}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{well he's handsome and he's charming. he's all right. for now. don't say it, i know, i'm rotten. i can't help it. i've tried to be good but it's too boring.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{the way you talk. never heard a woman talk like that.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{oh look, i haven't got time to be proper, i want to live. i'm a woman, i like men. if that's unladylike then i guess i'm not a lady. at least i'm honest.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{well you're different, no arguing that. but you're a lady all right. i will take my oath on it.}
<A>__{he looks at her, enchanted, but suddenly his face clouds.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{i don't know, doesn't make any sense. i almost can't look at you. like it hurts.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{i know, me too. what should we do about it?}
<A>__{he takes her in his arms and kisses her. she sinks in his arms. he kisses her again then falls to her knees, throwing his arms around her legs and pressing his face into the folds of her skirts.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{god...}
<A>__{she runs a hand through his hair. he stands, lifting her with him until they are face to face and she can feel him pressing into her. after a beat:}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{you know this is adultery. you burn in hell for that.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{then let's make sure we get our money's worth}
