<T>__{camera on:}
<L>__{exterior forest meadow running naked day}
<A>__{jimmy has the camera and is chasing a naked (just from behind) judy through the woods. the camera shakes and rattles, but we can definitely tell this is all in good fun. judy screams as she is being chased through the woods. she couldn't feel more free. she begins to tire and slows down. she can no longer run and turns towards the camera. as she turns around, camera shows her from the waist up. she has a beer can in her hand and she is a little drunk. for the first time, she's completely at ease with her own body and looks perfectly natural being naked in the wilderness. she walks towards the camera smoothly and seductively. her long hair blond hair blows gently in the wind.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{i'm so glad you're out. next time your dad wants to take it in the ass, don't film him!}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{i know. ironic that i was the one sent to the nut house.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{i thought i was going to die without you. what if you and i could live here together? forever.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{right here?}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{i'm serious. maybe not here, but eventually we'll buy some land, and we can live together on it, and be naked whenever we want.}
<A>__{she takes a big swig of her beer. then burps.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{excuse me. what do you think?}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{i think you're drunk.}
<A>__{judy walks towards the camera. she puts her mouth inches away from the lens.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{i think you're right mister.}
<A>__{judy giggles, then dances around playfully in the woods. she has never felt so alive.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{i don't want this to ever end. i want to be here forever. i want to dance and be naked and be free, and i want us to ball our brains out everyday, and i want to feel the air on my body and i want to get drunk and not care about anything in the world. i just want us to be together in this moment.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{i know a place like that.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{you do?}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{yep. we can go there one day if you want.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{we can? where is it?}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{erlanger.}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(doesn't buy it)}
<D>__{erlanger!}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{yeah erlanger. everybody was talking about it in the nut house. that's all anybody fucking talked about was this dude who lives up there named uncle rodney. he supposedly has a commune where we can do this kind of thing every day.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{uncle rodney's commune?}
<A>__{judy smiles, almost laughing. it all sounds pretty ridiculous to her, but plays along anyway.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{that's funny.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<P>__{(playfully)}
<D>__{no, i'm serious.}
<A>__{judy walks back towards the camera and grabs it away from jimmy, surprising him.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{hey!}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{okay, now it's your turn.}
<A>__{shot from the waist up, we now see that jimmy's naked as well. he's at a loss as to what he should say.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{how does it feel to be a free man?}
<A>__{jimmy thinks. a drunk judy is losing her patience.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{come on, come on, come on...}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i'm thinking.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{just let it go, be free.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<P>__{(adoringly)}
<D>__{you're such a hippie all of sudden.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{come on.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{judy's not getting what she wants from him. camera shuts down.}
