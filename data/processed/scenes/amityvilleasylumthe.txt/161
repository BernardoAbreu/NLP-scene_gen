<L>__{78.interior cell night}
<A>__{lisa awakens, sat in the corner of a cold white cell. she tries to get up before realising she's strapped into a straight jacket. lisa screams. the hatch opens and mixter peers in. the hatch then closes and the door opens. mixter enters.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{let me out of here you sick fuck!!}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{now lisa, let's talk calmly or you will be sedated again.}
<A>__{mixter walks over and sits on the edge of the bed.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{why are you doing this?}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{you're having paranoid delusions. i'm also aware that you've been having disturbing visions.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i'm not having delusions, i know what i've seen!}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{well you think you know. the human brain is a powerful thing and i'm sure you do believe what you've seen. but it's all in your mind lisa, it's not reality. you're a very sick girl and you need treatment.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{you do this to all your staff huh? the minute we speak out we get fucking committed??}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{staff? you were never staff here lisa. you're a patient here. you've always been a patient here.}
<A>__{lisa appears confused.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{no, no. you're lying to me, i know who i am! i know who i am!!}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{i'm afraid not my dear. you've always been with us here. initially as an out patient but now the delusions have progressed i feel it's time for you to become a full time resident.}
<A>__{lisa becomes upset. tears stream down her face.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{but... but...}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{look, i understand it's a lot to process now. i will leave you to think about it and then we'll begin counselling sessions tomorrow.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{lisa sobs.}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{listen, how about i take this straight jacket off so you're more comfortable?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{first you must take this. it will help you sleep.}
<A>__{mixter hands lisa a red pill and a bottle of water. she takes the pill and pops it in her mouth before taking a gulp of water.}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{good girl. i know it's a lot to take in but together we'll get through this. now i'm going to take your restraint off. remember though, if you're violent then i promise you it will go straight back on. okay?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{mixter unties the straight jacket at the back and lifts it off.}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{that better?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{yes. thank you.}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{no problem. i'm going to leave you get some rest now. tomorrow we start the healing process.}
<A>__{mixter exits. the echo of the steel door closing reverberates around the tiny cell. we hear mixter's footsteps as he walks down the hallway. lisa's upset demeanour disappears immediately. she spits the red pill into the palm of her hand.}
