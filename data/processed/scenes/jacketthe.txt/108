<A>__{dr. morgan leads jackie and starks through a ward. starks looks around in disbelief; it's more like a hospital now than it ever was in 1993.}
<L>__{interior reception area, lorenson's office, alpine grove, 2004}
<A>__{as they arrive outside lorenson's office, morgan turns to them.}
<C>__{dr. morgan}
<D>__{let me just tell her we're here.}
<A>__{dr. morgan goes inside and jackie takes starks' hand as they wait. it's hardly more than a couple seconds when lorenson appears in the doorway. she looks at starks curiously and the two share a very lengthy, intense stare. dr. lorenson now in her 50s walks closer to starks suspiciously. for his part, starks doesn't look as unfamiliar with lorenson as he should; this doesn't escape lorenson.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{hello. i'm beth lorenson.}
<A>__{she puts out a hand that is trembling slightly.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{it's nice to meet you, mr. starks...}
<A>__{starks hesitates before he takes lorenson's hand. there is something very eerie about the exchange. starks quickly lets go and lorenson turns to jackie...}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{and you are...?}
<A>__{jackie looks back uncomfortably.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i'm just william's friend.}
<A>__{lorenson looks over both of them acutely and then calmly turns to dr. morgan.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{i think we'll be fine from here. thanks, stanley.}
