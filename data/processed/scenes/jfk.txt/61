<D>__{in response to the cashier's call, at least thirty officers in a fleet of patrol cars descend on the movie theatre. this has to be the most remarkable example of police intuition since the reichstag fire. i don't buy it. they knew someone knew oswald was going to be there. in fact, as early as 12:44, only 14 minutes after the assassination, the police radio put out a description matching oswald's size and build. brewer says the man was wearing a jacket, but the police say the man who shot tippit left his jacket behind. butch burroughs, theatre manager, says oswald bought some popcorn from him at the time of the tippit slaying. burroughs and witness bernard haire also said there was an oswald look alike taken from the theatre. perhaps it was he who sneaked into the theatre just after 1:30.}
<A>__{inside the theatre, cry of battle is on the screen. twelve to fourteen spectators sit scattered between the balcony and ground floor. brewer leads the officers onto the stage and the lights come on. he points to oswald.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{in any case, brewer helpfully leads the cops into the theatre and from the stage points oswald out...}
<A>__{the cops advance on oswald, who jumps up, as if expecting to be shot.}
<C>__{oswald}
<D>__{this is it!}
<C>__{policeman}
<D>__{kill the president, will you?}
<A>__{scared, oswald takes a swing at a policeman. he pulls out his gun. the officers close in on him from the rear and front. a wrestling and shoving match ensues. one officer gets a chokehold on oswald and another one hits him.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{the cops have their man! it was already been decided in washington.}
<A>__{outside the theatre, oswald, his eye blackened, is led out by the phalanx of officers. they are surrounded by an angry crowd.}
<C>__{crowd}
<D>__{kill him! kill him!}

<D>__{dr. best, himmler's right hand man in the gestapo, once said "as long as the police carries out the will of the leadership, it is acting legally." that mindset allowed for 400 political murders in the weimar republic of 1923 32, where the courts were controlled and the guilty acquitted. oswald must've felt like josef k in kafka's "the trial". he was never told the reason of his arrest, he does not know the unseen forces ranging against him, he cries out his outrage in the police lineup just like josef k excoriates the judge for not being told the charges against him. but the state is deaf. the quarry is caught. by the time he is brought from the theatre, a large crowd is waiting to scream at him. by the time he reaches police headquarters, he is booked for murdering tippit...}
<A>__{at the dallas police station, dallas police captain will fritz takes a call from a high official in washington. in the background we notice lee oswald continuing to be questioned by federal agents. we hear johnson's distinctive texas drawl but we never see him.}

<D>__{no legal counsel is provided. no record made of the long questioning.}

<D>__{thank you, mr. president. we're doing our best.}
<C>__{high official voice}
<D>__{cap'n, i know you're working like a hound dog down there to get this mess wrapped up, but i gotta tell you there's too much confusion coming out of dallas now. the tvs and the papers are full of rumour 'bout conspiracies. two gunmen, two rifles, the russkies done it, the cubans done it, that kinda loose talk, it's carin' the shit outta people, bubba'. this thing could lead us into a war that could cost 40 million lives. we got to show'em we got this thing under control. no question, no doubts, for the good of our country... you hear me?}

<D>__{yes, sir.}

<A>__{in an underground police garage, we see jack ruby being allowed in via an interior staircase by his police contact. he moves towards the outer edge of reporters, nervous. oswald comes out with his two guards. we see a repeat of the assassination in stop time... ruby's eyes, oswald's... do they recognize each other?}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{under the guise of a patriotic nightclub owner out to spare jackie kennedy from having to testify at a trial, jack ruby is shown into the underground garage by one of his inside men on the dallas police force, and when he's ready oswald is brought out like a sacrificial lamb and nicely disposed of as an enemy of the people. by early sunday afternoon, the autopsy has been completed on him. who grieves for lee harvey oswald? buried in a cheap grave under the name "oswald"? no one.}
<A>__{we see oswald dying on the floor of the police station. a paramedic pushes in and starts administering artificial respiration, which only aggravates the internal hemorrhaging. at a texas cemetery, oswald's mother weeps. oswald is buried with a few people present, but there are no details, no dates. we see marina whisked out by agents.}
