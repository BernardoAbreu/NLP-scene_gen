<L>__{interior courtroom morning}
<A>__{the gallery is crowded with reporters and spectators. dulaney sits beside rebecca at the defense table. cardenas stands before the jury. dulaney and cardenas are seated at their respective tables. rebecca sits beside dulaney. she is wearing a beautiful, well tailored dress. she looks beautiful and has surprisingly made no attempt to down play her looks. judge burnham, a confident black man in his fifties sits behind the bench. he is strong willed tough but fair. there is a rough edge to him from his childhood on the streets.}
<C>__{judge burnham}
<D>__{this trial by its very nature is explosive. the press is going to have a field day and i will not tolerate any activity in my courtroom that will fuel it.}
<P>__{(to dulaney and cardenas)}
<D>__{both of you are going to be delving into very personal aspects of peoples lives. i warn you now. when you do so if you cannot establish a clear line of relevancy early on in your examinations i will stop you. is that clear?}
<A>__{dulaney and cardenas both nod.}
<C>__{judge burnham}
<D>__{mr. cardenas.}
<A>__{cardenas stands and walks towards the jury.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<P>__{(points to rebecca)}
<D>__{you all can see the defendant, rebecca lawson. but as this trial proceeds you will see that she is not only the defendant she is the murder weapon itself.}
<P>__{(stops and thinks for a moment)}
<D>__{is that possible? can a person actually be a weapon? the answer is yes. if i hit you and you die i am the cause of your death. but can sex be called a weapon? yes. and what a deadly weapon rebecca lawson made of it. the state will prove that miss lawson seduced andrew marsh that she put increasing sexual demands on him while she secretly administered cocaine. all the while knowing that he had a severe heart condition.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{she is a beautiful woman but when this trial is over you will see her no differently than a gun, or a knife or any other instrument used as a weapon. she is a killer. and the worst kind one who disguised herself as a loving partner.}
<A>__{cardenas walks back to the prosecution table and sits down.}
<C>__{judge burnham}
<D>__{mr. dulaney?}
<A>__{dulaney stands up and approaches the jury.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{i know what you're thinking and it's a mistake. you look at miss lawson and you see a beautiful woman who was involved with an older man and you think she looks like the type. she could've done it. and that's exactly what the district attorney wants you to think. yes, she is beautiful. so what? does that make her a killer? of course not. this case is not about appearances. it's about facts.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{as mr. cardenas presents his case you will see that there are very few facts that the bulk of the states evidence is circumstantial. i'm confident that by the conclusion of this trial you will not just have a reasonable doubt. you will have no doubt at all that rebecca lawson is innocent of the charges against her.}
