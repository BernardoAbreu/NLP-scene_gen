<L>__{interior john and lori's living room moments later day}
<A>__{lori, now in a robe, sits down on the couch, facing ted.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{look, john loves you very much. more than anything in the world. and he's fallin' to fuckin' pieces without you. he knows he screwed up big time, but you gotta believe me that is wasn't all his fault. if you'll just give him one more chance to be with you }
<A>__{she rolls her eyes.}
<C>__{ted }
<D>__{listen to me! if you'll just give him one more chance... i promise i will leave and never come back. he'll be all yours. just give him one more chance.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{ted... that's a very nice offer, but i don't want you to do that. this is about john and me and our problems. and i don't think it can be fixed.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{because of me! look, you want him to be a man. and i'm the one who's keepin' that from happening. as long as he's got his teddy bear, he's still a boy. and i care about him as much as you do. but i'm willing to give up the boy so you can have the man.}
<A>__{we can see lori starting to soften a bit.}
<C>__{ted }
<D>__{look, i'm givin' this the best shot i got here, lori. i'm beggin' you. i'm no good at this emotional crap, but i gotta help my best friend. please. just talk to him.}
<C>__{lori}
<P>__{(sigh)}
<D>__{i will talk to him.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{thank you. he's waitin' for me down at charley's. so... maybe you could, y'know... go down instead of me?}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{what... now?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{please. you'll regret it for the rest of your life if you don't.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{alright, alright, i will go.}
