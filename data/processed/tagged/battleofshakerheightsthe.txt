<B>__{the battle of shaker heights}
<A>__{written by erica beeney}
<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{exterior forest day}
<B>__{distant gun and mortar fire}
<A>__{muffled by the wet green forest. the very earth seems to tremble.}
<B>__{a rabbit}
<A>__{darts out of a log, lifts itself on its hind legs and sniffs the air.}
<B>__{lobbed grenade explodes}
<A>__{voices and shouts, closer now, mix with the rumbling war sounds in a veritable symphony of violence and confusion. a dead american gi lays splayed out, careless in death. a pair of soldiers flash among the trees, running hunched over and low, and disappear into the gray blooms of smoke. for a moment the forest takes a breath. nothing but trembling leaves. then the rattle of a jeep coming closer in fits and starts, grinding through low gears. a willys mb appears, crashing through the undergrowth. it's driven by private first class kelly ernswiler. eighteen, if that. not much meat on him. his insignias indicate he's in the 29th infantry. his face might be attractive, under other conditions. he pauses and pulls a map from the pocket of his m41 standard issue field jacket.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{where the hell are those krauts?}
<A>__{to give himself courage, he sings tommy dorsey's "i will be seeing you [in all the old familiar places]" while maneuvering the jeep through the bushes and rocks. he drives straight for a fallen log, guns the engine and tries to go over it. the jeep's front wheels catch on the log. the back tires spin. kelly gets out. takes off his m1 combat helmet and wipes his face. assesses the situation. he grabs a branch. jams it under the wheel, trying to lever the jeep free. when the stutter of a nearby machine gun startles him. the branch snaps against kelly's weight. he slips and falls in the mud.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{determined, he grabs his pack and carbine and sets off on foot through the forest.}
<L>__{exterior clearing}
<A>__{kelly strides purposefully out of the woods. pauses against a split rail fence beneath the innocent sun. across the clearing stands a seemingly abandoned barn. but not for long, as two german infantrymen appear around the corner of it. kelly moves behind a tree to assess the situation. unaware, the germans smoke and talk. kelly's too far away to hear them but he watches their every move. they're relaxed, not as on guard as they should be. their karabiners rest slung across their backs.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{bingo.}
<B>__{against the tree}
<A>__{kelly focuses himself. then he shoulders his carbine. pulls out his dog tags and kisses them grimly.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{"and so they buried hector, breaker of horses."}
<A>__{he takes his smith & wesson 1917 pistol from his pistol belt and steps out into the sunlight field in plain sight of the guards. surely he knows they can see him. he must want them to see him. but they don't. too busy passing nudie wallet photos. halfway across the open grass, kelly raises the pistol but does not aim it. just strides steadily closer, arms spread out, making himself an easy target. crazy as it seems, private kelly ernswiler is trying to get himself killed.}
<L>__{exterior barn}
<A>__{kelly pauses not twenty feet from the germans, fires into the air and waves when from behind him comes a voice.}
<C>__{german officer}
<P>__{(o.s.)}
<D>__{eine maus findet den kase.}
<A>__{kelly whips around to face a third german, the officer. his pistol points right into the officer's shocked pink young face. point blank range. only kelly doesn't fire. he just lowers the pistol. the german smiles.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{kill me adolf.}
<C>__{german officer}
<D>__{mien prisoner!}
<A>__{the infantrymen have recovered from their idle and come running. one of them yanks kelly's hands behind his back and pushes him into the barn roughly. kelly doesn't struggle.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{hey, siegfreid and roy. what are you waiting for? kill me.}
<L>__{interior barn}
<A>__{kelly sits slumped in a chair, legs tied up. one of the germans shines a flashlight in his face. kelly squints.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{come on you pussies. let's get this over with.}
<A>__{the german officer produces a piece of paper and a fountain pen.}
<C>__{german officer}
<P>__{(german accent)}
<D>__{you will write your mother. tell her how you will die now.}
<A>__{kelly takes the pen and examines it.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{genuine third reich issue, no less. nice work.}
<A>__{the officer pokes the paper.}
<C>__{german officer}
<D>__{you will write. how you die alone.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{my mother and i don't have that kind of relationship.}
<C>__{german officer}
<P>__{(hisses)}
<D>__{write.}
<A>__{kelly thinks about it for a minute should he or shouldn't he but sighs and begins writing. after a few lines, the officer snatches the paper away and passes it to an infantryman.}
<C>__{german officer}
<D>__{enough. now you will beg for your life.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{what don't you understand?}
<C>__{infantryman}
<P>__{(interrupts sheepishly in german accent)}
<D>__{the protocol says we should }
<A>__{the officer wheels around and scowls at the speaker. he seems to be getting a bit hysterical.}
<C>__{german officer}
<D>__{i am the fucking protocol.}
<P>__{(to kelly)}
<D>__{beg!}
<A>__{he and kelly glare at each other. the officer fires his luger into the rafters.}
<C>__{german officer}
<D>__{beg for your life!}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{you got to be kidding me.}
<A>__{the officer grabs his throat.}
<C>__{german officer}
<D>__{silence. now i have a little fun.}
<A>__{kelly laughs. the officer slaps him. kelly jerks away.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{now that's against the rules.}
<C>__{german officer}
<P>__{(sneers)}
<D>__{there are no rules in war.}
<A>__{suddenly another american gi appears behind the german in the shadows. only kelly can see him. the gi motions to kelly "keep talking" while he gets into a better position with his m 1 rifle.}
<C>__{kelly}
<P>__{(to officer)}
<D>__{you've never killed anyone before, have you?}
<C>__{german officer}
<D>__{i shower in the blood of my victims }
<A>__{the gi shoots the two infantrymen who fall in exaggerated pain and commence death throes. quick as a flash, the gi's colt 1911 pistol is at the german officer's neck, his m 1 in his other hand.}
<C>__{gi}
<D>__{no wonder you smell so bad.}
<C>__{german officer}
<D>__{don't shoot, please.}
<A>__{the gi's eyes widen. he looks at kelly.}
<C>__{gi}
<D>__{will you look at the manners on this guy?}
<P>__{(to german)}
<D>__{remember to thank me when i kill you.}
<C>__{german officer}
<D>__{no, really, not in the neck }
<A>__{but the gi does anyway. the officer shrieks, grabs at his neck, and falls.}
<C>__{gi}
<P>__{(to kelly)}
<D>__{you all right?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{yeah. my elaborate death scene wasn't going anywhere anyway.}
<C>__{gi}
<D>__{you want me to give you a minute?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{that's okay. they'll get me eventually. if you can't get killed in a war, when can you?}
<C>__{gi}
<D>__{that's right. look on the bright side.}
<A>__{the gi holds out his hand.}
<C>__{gi}
<D>__{bart. bart bowland.}
<A>__{kelly takes the hand of the grinning all american type guy. about his own age, but bart takes up more space.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{kelly. kelly ernswiler.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{kelly?}
<C>__{kelly}
<P>__{(mimics)}
<D>__{bart?}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{i mean that's irish, right?}
<C>__{german officer}
<P>__{(from the floor, now}
<D>__{with a decidedly}
<P>__{american accent)}
<D>__{wow man, this is a really beautiful scene and all, but i have to interrupt.}
<P>__{(to bart)}
<D>__{why the fuck did you have to shoot that cap so close to my neck? you gave me a powder burn.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{listen you wienerschnitzel. you should talk. you slapped me. i'm not your bitch.}
<A>__{the officer gets up and dusts off his uniform.}
<C>__{german officer}
<D>__{well, what was that whole creepy death wish thing about?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{well it didn't work, now did it?}
<C>__{german officer}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{sometimes i get so caught up in the moment.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{and what was that ridiculous shit about making me write to my mother?}
<A>__{the officer grins.}
<C>__{german officer}
<D>__{inspired, wasn't it?}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{dude, you made him write to his mother? who are you, dr. phil?}
<C>__{infantryman}
<P>__{(also with american accent)}
<D>__{can we get up now?}
<A>__{bart helps him up and checks his regulation issue timex.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{might as well. there's only an hour left anyway.}
<A>__{the german officer crosses his arms.}
<C>__{german officer}
<P>__{(to kelly)}
<D>__{admit it. you were scared.}
<C>__{kelly}
<P>__{(snorts)}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{kelly gets up from the chair and falls over. his legs are still tied.}
<L>__{exterior forest}
<A>__{the dead gi gets up and walks off with the germans and some other soldiers, done for the day. bart and kelly walk back to the stranded jeep.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{that willys yours?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{yup. just got her. three summers packing out at shop rite.}
<A>__{bart unfolds an entrenching tool from his belt and digs under the back wheels, building up dirt. then he goes around to the front and puts his shoulder against the hood. bart rocks the jeep while kelly pumps the gas. the jeep finally pulls free and sprays bart with mud.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{my bad. thanks though.}
<A>__{kelly looks over his shoulder and starts backing away.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{see you.}
<A>__{bart stands there, dripping with mud, shocked. about a hundred feet away kelly stops.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{well, come on.}
<A>__{bart walks towards the jeep. kelly backs it up again.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i couldn't resist.}
<A>__{bart climbs in.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{real funny, ernswiler. you might still get your chance to die today.}
<L>__{interior diner day}
<A>__{the customers are all reenactors. some yanks, some germans, a few scottish and north african irregulars. "boogie woogie bugle boy" plays on the jukebox. bart and kelly sit in a booth together. bart has an easy, confident manner and expansive gestures. kelly eats hunched over, like someone might try and steal his food.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{character building? those crazy guys from ann arbor tied them to a dock.}
<C>__{kelly}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{that's what you get for invading wisconsin.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{d day at kenosha was nothing. at guadalcanal chillicothe there was a guy who actually injected himself with malaria.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{that's crazy.}
<A>__{they both eat for a minute.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{where do you live, anyway?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{shaker heights.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{that explains the death wish. me too. what street?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{penn place.}
<C>__{bart}
<P>__{(chewing)}
<D>__{hmm, don't know it.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{it's not technically in shaker heights but i go to shaker heights high.}
<A>__{pause. kelly looks at bart.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{langely prep.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{sorry to hear that.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{well, i got kicked out of shaker heights high because my birdhouse came unglued in honors woodshop.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{of course. i would have gone to langely myself only my polo pony had the fits.}
<A>__{bart throws his napkin on his plate.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{no matter.}
<P>__{(raises his voice to address the room)}
<D>__{we're all soldiers here.}
<C>__{crowd}
<D>__{that's right. here, here. whooping, cheers, etc.}
<L>__{exterior bowland house day}
<A>__{kelly pulls up into the circular gravel drive. bart's house is fancy. a nice yard and a pool. bart hops out.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{you should come over some time. service our lawnmower.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i would, but then i might soil my croquet whites. you understand.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{how bourgeois. cheerio then.}
<A>__{kelly watches bart go into his house and smiles in spite of himself.}
<L>__{exterior ernswiler house dusk}
<A>__{kelly's house is a also pretty nice, nothing to be ashamed of. it is smaller and weirder. the flowers and bushes are overgrown and strange sculptures dot the yard, some leaning at precarious angles. kelly washes his jeep in the driveway.}
<L>__{exterior ernswiler house night}
<A>__{kelly buffs the headlamps with a chamois. the jeep looks good as new. he pulls a canvas cover over it.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{sleep tight hot lips.}
<L>__{interior ernswiler house, kitchen night}
<A>__{kelly walks in on his dad abe making sandwiches. a great big pile of cheese and pb&j.}
<C>__{abe}
<D>__{sergeant keller! how was the war? did we win?}
<A>__{kelly doesn't smile at this. he looks at the sandwiches and puts his finger to his chin in a gesture so facetious it's downright angry.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{let me guess. happy meals for the wavy gravy wellness center?}
<A>__{abe grabs two pieces of bread from a loaf. he looks kind. a bit ill used by life. the phrase "rode hard and put away wet" comes to mind.}
<C>__{abe}
<D>__{as usual, your cynicism is refreshing.}
<A>__{he finishes that sandwich and adds it to the pile. kelly pauses while opening the refrigerator. his back tightens. he slams the door with his foot.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{as usual, your cheerful optimism makes me ill.}
<A>__{abe pauses over a slice of bread only briefly. the hostility is nothing new.}
<C>__{abe}
<P>__{(lightly)}
<D>__{you should get that checked.}
<A>__{kelly walks through the kitchen and out the back door.}
<C>__{kelly}
<P>__{(o.s.)}
<D>__{sure thing, doc. say hello to leif garrett for me.}
<L>__{interior ernswiler garage night}
<A>__{kelly opens the screen door and pokes his head in. a family of chinese immigrants, the lings, paints canvases at long worktables. there's a mother, father mao, grandmother xiou xiou, son and daughter. finished canvases hang from the walls and lean in piles against it. all of them are portraits of animals. some have on hats or clothes. kelly's mom eve shows grandmother xiou xiou a few strokes with a paintbrush. eve wears jeans. she's one of those young looking mothers kelly's friends would have crushes on. if he had any friends.}
<C>__{mao}
<P>__{(to kelly)}
<D>__{son of eve. you are very dirty.}
<C>__{kelly}
<P>__{(awkward)}
<D>__{a rough charge. you know.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(to kelly)}
<D>__{don't touch anything. we have to get ready for the starving artist show.}
<P>__{(to xiou xiou)}
<D>__{now nana, the gold has to be feathery, not gloppy see?}
<A>__{eve demonstrates on the painting a pair of monkeys in french court dress. kelly looks over his mom's shoulder.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{now you try.}
<A>__{grandmother xiou xiou dabs at the painting.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(to kelly)}
<D>__{she loves the gold. always overuses it. and usually her touch is so light. xiou xiou gold is the color of the sun.}
<A>__{eve moves along the row, stopping to look at the paintings in progress.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{you know why we never have anything to eat in this house?}
<A>__{but eve has stopped behind mao's painting. she's not paying attention to kelly.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{mao, what did we say about the eyes?}
<A>__{she gestures at the image of a horse done santa fe style, lots of pastels, very abstract. mao looks at her quizzically.}
<C>__{mao}
<D>__{more empathy?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{that's right. and didn't i tell you to put in more cacti?}
<C>__{mao}
<P>__{(shakes head)}
<D>__{no, no more cacti. too busy. simplicity is best.}
<A>__{his family nods in support of this rash aesthetic statement. eve rolls her eyes.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{oh boy. i'm not having this battle with you again.}
<A>__{kelly breaks in.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{because your husband takes food from his own family to feed every loser druggie in cleveland.}
<A>__{eve moves down the line.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{well, you can always chip in here. we're ordering pizza later.}
<A>__{at this the family nods and smiles to each other, pleased with the news.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{no. some people have to work later.}
<P>__{(casual)}
<D>__{will you drop something off at the dry cleaners for me tomorrow?}
<A>__{eve looks up at him for the first time. takes in his filthy uniform.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{sweetie, you know what we said about paying for the war things. nothing's changed.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{it's the only thing i ever ask you for }
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{don't be dramatic.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{but it's important to me.}
<A>__{eve stops at mother ling's painting.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{you're just going to have to find a way to pay for it yourself then, i guess.}
<P>__{(to mother ling)}
<D>__{no not that way the sky should be stormier. angry clouds.}
<A>__{mother ling looks up at kelly, who's scowling. she smiles and nods, understanding.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{why do i bother?}
<A>__{kelly leaves. eve's busy talking.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{more brown, less blue.}
<L>__{interior kitchen night}
<A>__{kelly comes back in a grabs a sandwich off the pile.}
<C>__{abe}
<D>__{now keller, who needs that sandwich more you or the daughter of a crack addict trying to make a new life?}
<A>__{kelly looks at him and bites into the sandwich.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{how about the son of a heroin addict trying to get ready for work?}
<A>__{kelly leaves with the sandwich. abe sighs and picks up more bread.}
<C>__{abe}
<D>__{that went well.}
<L>__{interior kelly's room night}
<A>__{on the walls a poster for the civil war miniseries next to one of led zeppelin. some maps. a globe. models of fighter planes and a set of old tin soldiers. oh yeah, and his mom's original painting, the one that started it all, this one signed by her a very intense looking pink rabbit glaring out of the canvas with huge eyes. he sits on the edge of the bed for a minute staring into space before he peels off his muddy uniform piece by piece.}
<L>__{interior grocery store night}
<A>__{ah, the graveyard shift. musak steely dan. kelly unpacks cat food. thousands and thousands of little cans of it. it's hard to keep the rows straight on the shelves. sarah, the night cashier, stands at her register. she's plain looking now but she'll be beautiful later when she figures out who she is. not another soul in the store. sarah wanders over to kelly's aisle as if pulled by a magnet.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{so how'd your battle go today? i still don't understand how you could reenact the battle of the bulge in seventy two degree weather.}
<P>__{(plays with hair)}
<D>__{didn't all those guys freeze to death?}
<A>__{kelly doesn't stop working. he's got a system.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{well, a port a john fell over on a couple of guys.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{that's gross.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{war is hell.}
<A>__{kelly grabs another handful of cans.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{then why do you do it?}
<A>__{kelly pauses. he puts two cans on the shelf very deliberately.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{you're never more alive then when facing simulated death.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{really? maybe i should try it.}
<A>__{kelly looks at her, thinks about this, and stands up.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{you are william j. stone of the 1st airborne, pinned down in noville. the germans have the high ground and they're shelling your position heavily.}
<P>__{(starts throwing cans)}
<D>__{you're holed up in a stone barn. sustaining heavy casualties. running low on ammo. the cries of wounded men fill the air like the cries of hungry babies.}
<A>__{sarah covers her head, huddled behind the boxes of cat food, dodging cans.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{your commanding officer gets hit in the face, dies. at 1 p.m. you lose radio contact with headquarters. if you withdraw, the germans will flank the entire allied forces arrayed along bastogne and break the front. what do you do? what do you do?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{stop it!}
<A>__{kelly goes back to stocking, satisfied.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{battle of bulge, the southern shoulder, december '44.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{sorry i asked.}
<A>__{sarah stands up and starts to wander away but kelly makes a peace offering.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{hey. want a snack? we got a whole shipment in of busted oreo's.}
<A>__{sarah looks at her feet, considering whether or not to accept it.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i will accidentally drop a couple pints of milk and meet you over there.}
<L>__{interior dairy backroom}
<A>__{sarah and kelly sit on milk crates, pass the cookies back and forth and get philosophical.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{the frozen food woman came in with her kids. they must eat out of those little cardboard trays every night. one of the kids looked like cardboard.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{do you know we stock more flavors of cat food than we do baby food?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{sixteen flavors of baby food including the toddler meals in ajar, thirty one flavors of cat food.}
<A>__{he fishes for a cookie.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{next time you should tell that woman to buy her kid some cat food.}
<A>__{an angry woman pushes open the swinging door of the backroom with her loaded shopping cart.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{is this store open? i've been waiting up front. if the store's closed, it shouldn't have a sign that says twenty four hours.}
<A>__{sarah gets up. kelly stays right where he is, finishing a cookie.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{sorry about that.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{i have a lot of coupons and i don't want to be here when they expire.}
<C>__{kelly}
<P>__{(to sarah)}
<D>__{charge her double for everything.}
<A>__{sarah smiles and hurries away.}
<L>__{interior shaker heights high day}
<A>__{kelly walks down the hall with his army issue backpack slung over one shoulder. besides a serious case of bedhead, he looks normal. no one says hi to him as he makes his way to his locker. as he twirls the combination and opens it, he notices lance short and wide, built like a tank, prematurely balding, and his girlfriend bridget embracing a few lockers down. they kiss raunchily, their tongues darting in and out of each other's mouths. lance sees kelly looking and stops kissing.}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{what the fuck are you looking at, gi jane?}
<A>__{kelly shakes his head and gets a book out of his locker.}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{no really, what makes you think you can look at me?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i honestly didn't know it was you. i thought it was a free preview of the spice channel.}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{that's pretty funny. you got dental insurance?}
<A>__{kelly closes his locker and walks away. bridget wipes her mouth guiltily. lance shakes his head and pulls bridget to him, grinding his pelvis against hers.}
<C>__{bridget}
<D>__{stop it.}
<A>__{she walks away.}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{what? what?}
<L>__{interior classroom day}
<A>__{the lights are off in history class. the teacher mr. norman shows slides on the civil war. the more we see the clearer it becomes that they are his own photos from a vacation spent visiting the memorials. mr. norman smiles out at his class in shot after shot. he clicks the remote and a photo of his wife, crouched over and wearing shorts, drinking from a garden hose appears on screen.}
<C>__{mr. norman}
<D>__{whoops!}
<A>__{he hurries through to the next slide. it doesn't matter anyway. everyone is almost asleep. except kelly, who becomes increasingly irritated the more mr. norman talks.}
<C>__{mr. norman}
<D>__{and here, at gettysburg, the ranks of union soldiers fought bravely on. they were willing to give their lives so that others might be free.}
<A>__{kelly shifts in his seat.}
<C>__{mr. norman}
<D>__{is there a problem mr. ernswiler?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{but mr. norman doesn't start talking again. he waits, looking at kelly, smiling blandly. until the silence becomes uncomfortable. and kelly gets mad.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{come on. isn't this analysis a tad simplistic? i mean, maybe for a second grade history class, sure but to insist on still characterizing the civil war as some moral struggle? the soldiers were drafted the only ones who had to fight were the ones who couldn't afford to pay their way out.}
<P>__{(losing it)}
<D>__{why don't you talk about the draft riots? where are your slides for that?}
<L>__{interior principal's office moments later}
<A>__{fresh flowers and a crocheted tissue box hoodie make the place cozy. kelly sits across the desk from principal holmstead, a well groomed woman with a gentle talk show host demeanor.}
<C>__{holmstead}
<D>__{what gives you the idea that you can or ought to question the curriculum?}
<A>__{kelly doesn't move. he's not into this.}

<D>__{i know. i mean, who ever heard of a classroom dialog? not socrates.}
<A>__{ms. holmstead is exasperated, but she likes him in spite of herself. he's a smart cookie. she's got to change her strategy. she leans back in her chair.}
<C>__{holmstead}
<D>__{kelly, you're a very bright boy. but you're making some serious mistakes.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i don't need to. everyone else makes them for me.}
<A>__{her chair squeaks as she leans forward and looks at kelly intently.}
<C>__{holmstead}
<D>__{this anger must be masking a lot of hurt.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i was wondering what the tissues were for.}
<A>__{holmstead tries again. she looks down at his file.}
<C>__{holmstead}
<D>__{i see you're not going to college next year. what are your plans?}
<A>__{kelly shrugs. holmstead searches his face for any clues.}
<C>__{holmstead}
<D>__{how do i get through to you?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{advertisers use status and sex to appeal to my demographic.}
<A>__{she shakes her head and swings her chair towards the window and gazes out at the front walkway of the school. her face clears. something's clicked.}

<D>__{i think we can come up with a punishment which might actually be more of an opportunity for you to realize your true potential.}
<L>__{exterior shaker heights high day}
<A>__{school's been out for a while. the first rush had already left. kelly comes down the front steps and starts across the parking lot to his jeep. lance steps out from behind an suv and intercepts him.}

<D>__{you upset bridget.}
<A>__{kelly hardly stops walking.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{give me a break.}

<C>__{lance}
<D>__{why are you fucking with me? you little fucker. want to play, fuckface?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{you just used fuck as a verb, noun, and adjective. impressive.}

<C>__{lance}
<D>__{let's see what beetle bailey's got in his knapsack.}
<A>__{lance grabs kelly's arm and yanks it back. kelly still seems unconcerned. suddenly he pulls away, but lance keeps hold of his backpack. lance holds the backpack up next to his head and points at it, gleeful. lance walks away towards his car. kelly runs after him. lance holds kelly off easily with one hand and throws the backpack into his suv. they struggle for a minute, until lance pushes kelly away, gets in the car. kelly runs next to the car and pounds on the window as lance drives off. finally, kelly gives up. lance turns out of the parking lot and honks the horn. kelly shakes his head.}

<C>__{kelly}

<D>__{if you stay in it long enough, maybe you'll get your fudgepacker badge.}
<A>__{ooh. the cro magnons laugh at lance and egg him on "you gonna take that?" "he just called you a fag", etc. lance frowns and grabs kelly.}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{you're a regular howie mandel.}
<A>__{still holding on to him with one arm, he slaps kelly hard across the face with the other. kelly's knees give a bit. lance holds him up.}

<D>__{one day you and me will be alone. and won't that be nice?}
<A>__{kelly is hurt but covering.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{too bad my mom won't let me date yet.}
<A>__{kelly frowns and adjusts his clothes. tries to re wet the dry inside of his mouth with his tongue. he turns slowly and trudges up the stairs. sarah has been watching the whole thing from the door.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{why do you mess with him?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{you're right. i should give him a break.}

<A>__{kelly looks at the tv.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{get abe to do it.}

<C>__{eve}
<D>__{when are you going to give me a break?}
<A>__{kelly jabs at the remote.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{let me think maybe when i finally forget every single word of the little mermaid soundtrack i'd listen to in the car waiting for him to score. no, probably when i don't prepare myself before i go into the bathroom, expecting to find him passed out on the floor.}
<A>__{eve waits through this.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{actually, you know what? i know i will be able to put it all behind me when i go away to college.}
<P>__{(slaps his forehead, pretend remembering)}
<D>__{only, i can't go because someone spent my college fund on mexican black tar. so looks like i will have to try to forget at shop rite, where i will be working for the rest of my life.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{you're right. you have every reason to crawl into the corner and give up. but please just get me some paints first.}

<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{what do you need?}
<A>__{she gives him the money.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{we need burnt sienna, cadmium red, and midnight blue. two tubes of blue.}
<P>__{(looks at him)}

<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{forget it.}
<L>__{interior art supply store day}
<A>__{kelly looks through the paints, picking out tubes. he looks up and sees tabby browsing the paintbrushes. he's suddenly nervous. he knocks over a few cans of thinner. almost leaves. instead, he gathers his courage, goes to the display opposite hers and waits to catch her eye.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{they're having a sale on glitter.}
<A>__{it takes tabby a second to recognize him.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{oh, hello. what happened to you?}
<C>__{kelly}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{tennis injury.}
<A>__{tabby looks at him suspiciously like she's not sure whether to believe him. tabby finishes with the mediums and moves onto the paints. kelly follows her, staying in the opposite aisle.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{you paint?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{well, you see... that's a difficult question.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{how so?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i don't really feel comfortable calling anything done since the renaissance "painting." we might have a more experimental interaction with the picture plane, but our skills have suffered from it.}
<A>__{in spite of herself, tabby laughs at this. this gives kelly more confidence. he leans over the aisle to see what she's looking at.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{you're working with acrylic. why? oil's much richer.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{oh you're not one of those oil snobs are you?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{of course not.}
<A>__{kelly comes around and leans nonchalantly against the shelves, knocks more things over and fumbles to replace them.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{it's just isn't acrylic a bit jejune?}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{jejune? you're jejune. how old are you anyway?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{older than my years.}
<A>__{tabby walks to the counter with her brushes.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{and you paint?}
<A>__{kelly looks down and partially confesses.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{well, you know, my mother's kind of an artist, so }
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{that explains it.}
<A>__{tabby signs the slip and takes the bag. she walks out, kelly with her, matches her pace, talking.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{that explains nothing. doesn't anyone believe in innate knowledge anymore? michelangelo was fifteen when he painted the infanta.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{infantas are spanish. michelangelo was italian.}
<A>__{tabby gets into her car. kelly leans into her window.}

<D>__{sure. i got a couple purple hearts. a silver star. dsc. can't sell them to you though. they were gramp's.}

<D>__{throw in one of those backpacks and we'll call it even.}
<A>__{the skinny guy looks at bart, and in the bag again. he goes to get the backpack. kelly's impressed by this smooth exchange. flea market between rows kelly and bart weave through the maze of stands. kelly now holds the backpack.}

<D>__{buying and selling us service medals is illegal.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{exactly. that's why the resale value is so high.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{is that what they teach you at langely?}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{don't be so naive. we all have our skeletons. some of them just pay more than others.}

<D>__{so, what do we have here, a little painting class?}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{kelly's a friend of bart's. he paints.}
<C>__{miner}
<D>__{oh? what's your real job?}
<A>__{kelly smiles eagerly at miner over the edge of his canvas.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{that would be stock boy at the shop rite. but, as president don kaminsky says, every employee is part owner. so you could say i'm a captain of industry in training. kind of capitalist larva.}
<C>__{miner}
<D>__{that's quite an image.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{only if you see the most magical part. do you see?}
<C>__{miner}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{kelly spreads his arms out and flaps them a little.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{one day i will be a beautiful butterfly. first i will have to be a pupa though. i figure i won't be going out much then. pupa: the awkward adolescence of the insect world.}
<A>__{miner stares at kelly. he can't tell what he might be making fun of, or if it might be him.}
<C>__{miner}
<D>__{whatever it takes to get you through the day.}
<A>__{kelly rolls his eyes at this uninspired response, though miner doesn't see it. he grabs tabby's paintbrush and pulls her to him.}
<C>__{miner}
<D>__{i have the afternoon off. come away with me.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{i'm not at a good stopping pointerior}
<C>__{miner}
<D>__{oh, come on. they'll still be here.}
<P>__{(to kelly)}
<D>__{i know you'll still be here.}
<A>__{kelly smiles his most idiotic energetic smile and slaps paint on his canvas in exaggerated strokes.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{i really shouldn't.}
<C>__{miner}
<D>__{but everyone will be coming soon. and it will get all crazy, and we won't have any time to ourselves.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{we will. i promise.}
<A>__{tabby kisses miner. he realizes there's no convincing her and sighs.}
<C>__{miner}
<D>__{like tonight? we can practice honeymoon suite.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{maybe. probably.}
<A>__{miner looks at kelly, who looks away. then he puts his hands in his pockets and leaves. tabby and kelly paint in silence for a while. kelly moves around to look at his canvas from different angles, like he's copying what he thinks a painter would do.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{is he always like that?}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{overbearing.}
<A>__{tabby stops and puts down her brush.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{just because he didn't want to picture you as a pupa?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{oh, he will later. when he's alone. whether he wants to or not.}
<A>__{kelly paints.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{not that though. how he wanted you to stop.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{he wants to be with me. what's so bad about that?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{just because some one wants to be with you doesn't mean they're good for you.}
<A>__{kelly is suddenly very involved with his painting. he has a hard time making eye contact with tabby.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{no one should ever ask you to stop. if you stop, you might not be able to start again. or you might start again, only things will be different.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{well, that's sweet }
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{it's not sweet, actually. it's just the truth.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{hey, i can take care of myself.}
<A>__{she picks up her brush.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{when's the wedding?}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{at the end of the month. but don't ask me about it. it makes me nervous.}
<A>__{kelly looks at her seriously.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{why? is something wrong?}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{awkward silence.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{what are you painting?}
<A>__{kelly stops and sighs, now back in serious artist mode.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{really, there are so many layers of imagistic symbolism that i really don't feel comfortable summing it up, but, well it's a recurring dream image. a mermaid riding a rocket ship.}
<A>__{tabby stops painting.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{what do you mean, "how?" sidesaddle. she's riding it sidesaddle. she's got a fish tail, for chrissake. i haven't decided yet if she's got scuba gear on or not.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{do you have any idea what you're talking about?}
<A>__{kelly puts up his thumb in an approximation of an artist's gesture.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{does that matter?}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{well, some people actually say what they really think.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{what if they don't know what they really think?}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{it doesn't matter. it's called being yourself.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{sounds boring.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{not boring. scary and wonderful and exciting.}
<A>__{kelly stops squeezing paint onto his palette. his gestures slow down. he's taking this in. then he shakes it off.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{hey. i'm trying to create here. stop distracting me.}
<L>__{interior eve's studio night}
<A>__{kelly comes in to return the art supplies. xiou xiou's alone working. she looks up and smiles at kelly.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{mom's got you working late? xiou xiou no.}
<A>__{kelly walks over and sees what she's working on. a beautiful spare chinese landscape.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{wow. you're really good. why do you make those stupid animals for mom? xiou xiou each painting is a lesson. here }
<A>__{she gets out a piece of paper for him.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i'm making a lot of art these days. i guess that means a lot of lessons. xiou xiou each line has a whole drawing contained in it. each drawing has a whole life contained in it.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{oh, that's all?}
<A>__{kelly watches her for a minute, the delicate whoop and swirl of her strokes. he dips a brush into the ink and watches xiou xiou's restrained and confident movements. eve leans against the doorframe.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{hey you two. i will try not to act surprised. it might spoil the moment.}
<A>__{kelly puts down the paintbrush.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i can't do this. i have to go.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{keller, i think i'm missing some art supplies. have you seen them around the house?}
<A>__{kelly avoids her eyes as he leaves.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{no, i haven't.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i don't know what to do with him. xiou xiou you son is not yet cooked. give him time.}
<A>__{eve looks over xiou xiou's shoulder.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{when are you going to let me give you your own show? we could do it for real. xiou xiou no problem. when you offer me an eighty twenty split.}
<L>__{interior bowland house, dining room night}
<A>__{kelly eats with the bowlands bart's mom, mathilda, his dad harrison, and tabby and bart. the bowlands dress up a bit for dinner, like any good wasp family.}
<C>__{bart}
<P>__{(to harrison)}
<D>__{ but i told you i want to take german }
<C>__{harrison}
<D>__{german's a cold war language. you can't get any kind of state department position without more diverse linguistic training than that. you'll take chinese.}
<A>__{bart frowns.}
<C>__{harrison}
<D>__{are we on the same page?}
<C>__{bart}
<P>__{(mutters)}
<D>__{same page.}
<A>__{everyone eats in silence.}
<C>__{mathilda}
<P>__{(to tabby)}
<D>__{so darling, when are you going to bite the bullet and do the seating arrangement?}
<A>__{tabby puts down her fork.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{i can't deal with that stuff, ma. i don't care who sits next to whom. i should have eloped.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{after all, mrs. bowland, sometimes when you bite the bullet, it explodes in your mouth.}
<A>__{mathilda looks surprised. this could go either way.}
<C>__{mathilda}
<P>__{(tentatively)}
<D>__{why, i've never thought about it before but that is a rather strange expression, isn't it? you wouldn't say, "sooner or later you've got to put the grenade in your pants," would you?}
<C>__{harrison}
<D>__{but have you ever noticed how in movies they always bite the grenade before they throw it?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{yeah, but they never take a bite out of their pants.}
<A>__{everyone but bart laughs. tabby throws kelly a grateful glance, for getting her out of a conversation she didn't want to have.}
<C>__{mathilda}
<D>__{what an unusual conversation! do you have similar discussions at the dinner table with your family, kelly?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{basically. i ask why all the furniture is missing and my dad reminisces about dropping acid and watching neil armstrong walk on the moon.}
<A>__{all but bart laughs again.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{he talks about art. bart mathilda you do?}
<A>__{kelly looks down at his plate.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{my mother's kind of an artist, so }
<C>__{harrison}
<D>__{you come from a creative family, do you?}
<A>__{mathilda salts her food.}
<C>__{mathilda}
<D>__{i wish my boys would talk to me about my passions. i can't get them anywhere near the subject of my garden.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i noticed your magnolias. very fine specimens.}
<C>__{mathilda}
<D>__{they are fine, aren't they?}
<A>__{mathilda beams.}
<C>__{bart}
<P>__{(ironic)}
<D>__{is there nothing you can't discuss?}
<A>__{if anyone notices the slight edge to bart's voice, they ignore it.}
<C>__{harrison}
<D>__{here, kelly, try a bit of these leeks. minnie has a way with the white sauce.}
<L>__{interior bart's room}
<A>__{kelly and bart play playstation ii "medal of honor" in bart's bedroom. bart is sulking, almost imperceptibly.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{my dad has this friend who's a director. he's shooting a documentary for the history channel.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{cool.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{he needs some guys to do a reenactment of some european theater battles for him.}
<A>__{kelly stops playing and looks at bart.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{we're going to be on the history channel?}
<A>__{bart's eyes stay on the screen.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{i haven't asked you yet.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{oh, come on.}
<A>__{kelly jabs at his controller.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{well, if you want to. next weekend. but you have to take it seriously.}
<A>__{kelly gives bart a derisive glance.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{what do you mean? of course i will.}
<A>__{the flickering tv light illuminates bart's pinched look.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{from what i've seen, you play fast and loose with your characterizations. this has got to be straight up.}
<A>__{this annoys kelly.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i'm not "fast and loose." i play the emotional truth. i make it real.}
<A>__{bart glances at him.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{like back in the dining room?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{what does that have to do with it?}
<A>__{bart shakes his head.}
<C>__{bart}
<P>__{(mimics)}
<D>__{"i noticed your magnolias. very fine specimens." that was real?}
<A>__{kelly's video game character dies. he drops the controller.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{what is this about?}
<C>__{bart}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{you just seem to have your own agenda, that's all.}
<A>__{bart plays on. he's keeping a lid on everything while kelly gets more and more agitated.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{my own agenda? what other reason is there to do anything?}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{i'm just saying. i know the difference between fantasy and reality.}
<A>__{kelly looks at bart in disbelief.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{are you saying i don't?}
<A>__{bart won't meet his eyes.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{bart pauses the game.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{why didn't you tell me your dad was a burn out?}
<A>__{kelly gets up and grabs his jacket.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{why do you steal from yours?}
<A>__{he leaves. bart un pauses the game and continues playing.}
<L>__{interior shaker heights high day}
<A>__{kelly drinks from the fountain and wipes his mouth on his sleeve. principal holmstead's smiling face greets him when he straightens up.}
<C>__{principal}
<D>__{kelly! i told some of your teachers about your presentation. we're all really looking forward to it.}
<A>__{kelly frowns at the principal's back as she clicks away. sarah appears. they walk down the hall together.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{what presentation?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i don't want to talk about it. as a matter of fact, do me a favor and pretend you never heard anything about it.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{okay. um.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{what, sarah?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{it's nothing. i }
<A>__{kelly starts to pull ahead.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i have an extra ticket to aerosmith this weekend.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{aw sarah, that's really great, i mean. it's just that i'm busy.}
<C>__{sarah}

<L>__{interior old soldiers' home day}

<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{yup.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{and what do you see in that?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{living, dying, camaraderie, bravery the big stuff. things we don't have anymore.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i see.}
<A>__{charlie sorts his tiles and scowls. he leans in to kelly's face, giving him the eye.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{and do you think it's brave getting trench foot and syphilis, eating another ration of spoiled frank and beans out of a dented can?}
<A>__{kelly is taken aback by this.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{well, no }
<A>__{charlie leans back and nods, thinking about kelly's response. he no longer seems angry.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yeah, that wouldn't be much fun, would it?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<A>__{charlie sets down a tile and pulls at his chin.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{parts of it were kind of fun though. i got separated from my platoon and lived for two weeks in the forest of the ardennes living off what i could kill.}

<C>__{bart}
<D>__{does it matter?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{of course it matters. doesn't the truth matter?}

<C>__{bart}
<D>__{i don't know. you tell me.}
<A>__{kelly avoids this by getting out of the car.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i want a drink. let me borrow a couple bucks.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{i told you not to play him for money.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i was trying to be nice. he's your friend.}
<A>__{bart returns the pump and screws in the gas cap.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{exactly. you should know better. what do you want.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{mountain dew }

<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{ oh shit.}
<A>__{but eve has seen him. she shields her eyes with her hand and calls to him.}

<C>__{bart}
<D>__{likewise. so, doing a little business?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{a little is right. but i work it as much as i can.}

<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i don't know what you're talking about. weddings? i love weddings. i always get drunk and make out with someone's cousin.}

<D>__{what? oh, i'm sorry.}

<D>__{i'm sorry.}

<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{you did, huh?}
<A>__{kelly walks over to her painting.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{like this painting. stare at it too long and you can't see it anymore. but if someone else sees it for the first time, they can tell exactly what it is.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{i don't need any more bullshit right now.}
