<L>__{exterior paris boulevard day}
<A>__{follow gavroche in as he races down a grand boulevard, dodging the crowds of strolling bourgeoisie and beggars, weaving in and out of the lines of carriages attempting to make their way in either direction. these are the conveyances of the rich, fine gilded coaches with matched horses and footmen on the back. virtually at a standstill, they lend gavroche a platform as he leaps from coach to coach, a street urchin dancing on the heads of the elite. as he goes, the poor on the pavements sing to the stony faced rich in their golden high sprung glory }
<C>__{beggars chorus}
<D>__{look down and see the beggars at your feet! look down and show some mercy if you can! look down and see the sweepings of the street!}

<A>__{the fine ladies and grand gentlemen in the carriages avert their eyes, or raise the blinds of their carriage windows to shut out the sight of the losers of their world. gavroche, bounding over their heads, evading the swipes of liveried footmen, lands on the running board of one particularly grand carriage and begs taunts the rich}

<D>__{`ow do you do? my name's gavroche! these are my people, here's my patch. not much to look at nothing posh! nothing that you'd call up to scratch. this is my school, my high society! here in the slums of st michel. we live on crumbs of humble piety tough on the teeth but what the hell! think you're poor? think you're free? follow me! follow me!}

<D>__{look down and show some mercy if you can! look down, look down, upon your fellow man!}
<A>__{still running with gavroche as he hops onto the back of another very grand carriage, the traffic now moving at last, hitching a ride on the back one or two of his gang hop on back of carriage with him, the others run panting after to hear his political lecture.}
<C>__{gavroche}
<D>__{there was a time we killed the king we tried to change the world too fast. now we have got another king, he is no better than the last. this is the land that fought for liberty now when we fight we fight for bread! here is the thing about equality everyone's equal when they're dead. take your place!}
