<L>__{interior harmsway's inner sanctum scottish manor house day}
<A>__{we're in a room that looks as if it could only exist in, well, a james bond movie: slick, stark, sterile. steel, glass, chrome. the six men are seated around a giant conference table, looking absurdly out of place in their formal mourning attire. elliot harmsway enters, (passing what appears to be the liechtenstein that hangs in the lobby of caa,) walks to the head of the table, takes off his gray mourning gloves, slaps them down, and:}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{good morning, gentlemen. i'm sorry to bring you here under these circumstances, but}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{considering our meeting was already scheduled, this was a happy coincidence.}
<A>__{the men nod. harmsway sits, dims the lights from a control panel.}
<C>__{harmsway }
<D>__{number one, your report?}
<A>__{a gap toothed californian with bland features stands.}
<C>__{number one}
<D>__{sir elliot: the entertainment division is releasing three new animated children's movies this year.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{by the time we're finished promoting them on our tv, radio, cable, newspaper, and magazine outlets }
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{there won't be a parent in the universe who won't feel guilty if they don't take their children to our stores and theme parks to buy the toys, books, video games and clothing featuring our 'lovable little creatures.'}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{we anticipate revenues of 3.1 billion dollars.}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{excellent, number one. build a better rat trap, and the world truly will beat a path to your theme park.}
<P>__{(turns to)}
<D>__{number two?}
<A>__{a young guy with glasses gets up, looking remarkably like bill gates.}
<C>__{number two}
<D>__{as you're aware, sir elliot, our software division has introduced a new computer operating system, gates '99.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's deliberately filled with bugs so people will be forced to buy our upgrades over the next five years.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the window on revenues is 2.8 billion.}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{outstanding, number two.}
<P>__{(beat, remembering:)}
<D>__{by the way number five ?}
<P>__{(a man looks up)}
<D>__{who's ahead in the american elections?}
<C>__{number five}
<D>__{the democrat, sir. by nine points.}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{maybe it's time to publish that story about his sex life. even things up. a close race is always better for our tv ratings.}
<C>__{number five}
<D>__{consider him slimed, sir.}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{splendid. nexterior..}
<P>__{(with noticeable reserve)}
<D>__{number three. your report?}
<A>__{a short middle eastern man stands. nervous.}
<C>__{number three}
<D>__{i regret to inform you, sir, that saddam hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the gulf war.}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{...haven't we already paid him for his services?}
<C>__{number three}
<D>__{yes, sir. but he still feels his people should share in the increased profits of our news division. he has proposed an additional 500 million dollar payment.}
<A>__{a pause. the other men in the room shift uncomfortably.}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{... and there's no truth that 10% of that money will go into your swiss bank account?}
<C>__{number three}
<D>__{no sir! i swear! this is not true!!}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{you disappoint me, number three.}
<A>__{harmsway presses a button. stamper enters. number three assumes this means death. he begs for his life:}
<C>__{number three}
<D>__{please sir. please }
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{...but because i am a just man, i've decided to give mr. hussein what he deserves.}
<A>__{number three is confused. does this mean he's going to live?}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{mr. stamper will escort you to the plane.}
<C>__{number three}
<P>__{(overwhelmed with gratitude)}
<D>__{thank you sir! thank you!}
<A>__{harmsway nods, watching him leave:}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{good bye, mr. azziz.}
<A>__{and the man is gone. harmsway turns his attention back to the room:}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{let's proceed with new business.}
<A>__{harmsway presses another button. the room darkens. the center of the table opens, and a 3 d map of malaysia rises into view.}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{gentlemen: in exactly 36 hours, we are going to initiate phase one of the word's most perfect crime: the biggest theft in the history of mankind.}
<P>__{(beat, pointing with a laser)}
<D>__{right here. in the strait of malacca.}
