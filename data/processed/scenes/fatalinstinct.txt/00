<T>__{fade in on:}
<L>__{exterior santa monica pier night}
<A>__{the sultry dampness of a blistering summer hangs in the night air. people stroll the boardwalk looking for a cool breeze. the soft rhythms of a jazz concert float from the band shell. close shot a pair of sexy high heels and a woman's shapely legs, walking along the wooden pier. opening titles & credits over. after several steps, a discarded piece of gum sticks to one of her shoes, stretching out stickily. two steps later, a piece of paper sticks to the gum, flopping awkwardly with each step. the moving camera pans up her gorgeous legs and sensuous body. she wears a loose summer dress that floats like gossamer around her soft curves. her hair is long and blond.}
<C>__{ned }
<D>__{to some guys, women are like a cheap puzzle... with pieces that just don't fit. they think the soul of a woman is darker than a back alley... more tangled than a telephone cord... and colder than a klondike bar in canada. but those guys don't even have a clue.}
<A>__{she stops at the railing. we see an incredibly beautiful face and cool, alluring eyes. this is lola cain. the term "femme fatale" was coined for her. she's on display... and knows it.}
<C>__{ned }
<D>__{when you know women the way i do, you understand exactly what what makes them tick... what makes them hum... what makes them jiggle up and down when they walk. and it's not the kind of thing you can learn from a correspondence course.}
<A>__{the camera moves with her as she walks on, passing two men whose eyes are glued to her. we hold on them. one is ned ravine, in his thirties, stalwart, handsome, hair trimmed neatly, but with a feel of loose ends about him... coat slung over his shoulder, sleeves rolled up, the sweat dampening his shirt. he's a cop. a plain clothes detective who's been around the block a few times and still gets lost. next to him is arch, his partner. older, if not in years, at least in mileage. dependable, solid, with no great aspirations except to reach the end of a shift intact. he's eating nachos from a cardboard container, licking the cheese off his fingers. the camera pushes in to ned. his eyes are fixed on lola. angle lola ned's pov she walks to the other side of the pier... as more paper sticks to the gum on her shoe. she stands at the railing.}
<C>__{ned }
<D>__{there are two kinds of women in this world... and i've known 'em both.}
<A>__{angle arch arch heaves an exasperated sigh and looks toward ned. the camera pulls back to include ned. it isn't "voice over" narration at all. ned is actually talking out loud.}
<C>__{ned }
<D>__{one will take you for a fast ride on a bumpy road with no seat belt. but the other kind...}
<C>__{arch}
<P>__{(interrupts)}
<D>__{jeez... knock off the chatter, will ya.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{just trying to keep you awake, arch.}
<C>__{arch}
<D>__{i'm awake! where do you come up with all that crap about women?}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{it's true. women are very complex, but if you know how to read 'em... they're an open book. you can always tell the rotten apples from the peaches.}
<C>__{arch}
<D>__{are you kiddin'?}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{i'd stake my career on it. anybody ever proves me wrong, i will throw away my badge.}
<C>__{arch}
<D>__{aayyhh... women are trouble...}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{i used to believe that too. until i married lana. now, she... is a peach.}
<C>__{arch}
<D>__{yeah, well you're a lucky stiff, pal. ya hold down two jobs. got a beautiful wife waitin' for ya at home. everything a guy could ever want, including no kids.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{i'd love to have kids.}
<C>__{arch}
<D>__{what?! rug rats? give me a break!}
<P>__{(looks around)}
<D>__{jeez, i hate stakeouts. what makes you think milo's gonna show up here?}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{logic. he knocked off all those banks. he's got cash. he's gonna want to spend it. this is one of the few places that still takes cash. sooner or later... he's gotta turn up.}
<C>__{arch}
<D>__{and how we s'posed to recognize this scumbag?}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{the "support hose bandit"? when you see him... you'll know him.}
<A>__{in the b.g., milo crumley, the "support hose bandit", ambles by casually, unnoticed, sucking on a cherry snow cone through the panty hose pulled down over his head.}
<C>__{arch}
<D>__{these are the best damn nachos in north america. maybe the world!}
<A>__{he pops the last chip in his mouth, licks his fingers and turns the container over.}
<C>__{arch}
<D>__{i'm empty. i'm gonna get a refill. you want some?}
<A>__{ned shakes his head. arch heads off to the nacho stand. ned steps over to the railing... gazes out at the ocean. a saxophone begins to wail a scorching, romantic melody... a recurrent tune that will come to be known as lola's theme. a beat later... lola moves to ned's side at the railing. he tries to ignore her presence, peering into the darkness. lola digs in her purse for a pack of cigarettes.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{got a light?}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{ned pulls out a small flashlight, shines it in her purse. she pulls a cigarette out of the pack, puts it to her lips... her eyes on ned, sizing him up.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{how about a match?}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{no thanks. i have plenty.}
<A>__{he pulls out a handful of matchbooks, shows her, then stuffs them back in his pocket. he turns and walks along the pier. she falls into step beside him, lighting her own cigarette. a saxophone player named dizzy follows behind them, continuing to play. he's the actual source of the romantic theme music we've been hearing.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{you really are incredibly stupid, aren't you? i like that in a man.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{i'd be insulted, but i know you're serious.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{you sound so sure of yourself.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{i'm not as dumb as i look.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{let me buy you a drink, mr. uh...}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{ravine. ned ravine. and you are...?}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{thirsty. what about that drink?}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{i'm on duty.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{brain surgeon?}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{cop.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{oooo... and i bet you have a big gun.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{you lose.}
<A>__{lola looks toward a nearby hot dog vendor.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{if i can't buy you a drink...}
<P>__{(nods toward vendor)}
<D>__{...let me buy you one of those.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{who can say no to a weiner?}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{not me.}
<A>__{lola turns to the hot dog vendor, raising two fingers.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{two dogs. hot.}
<A>__{she takes them... hands one to ned. he picks up the plastic mustard container to put mustard on her hot dog first.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{you come here often?}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{only when i'm in heat.}
<A>__{ned reacts to this, squeezing the container. a stream of mustard squirts out, hitting the front of lola's dress.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{oh! sorry.}
<A>__{flustered, he stuffs his hot dog into his inside jacket pocket, then tries to wipe the mustard off lola's dress, smearing it all over her, making it worse. she watches him with a cool, detached gaze as he fumbles ingenuously. suddenly, ned stops, looking off. he sees... milo crumley going into the public restroom. ned starts to leave. lola grabs his hand, holding it tightly against her breast.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{where ya going?}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{get something to wipe it off.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{that's okay. you're doing just fine.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{i will get you a wet paper towel.}
<A>__{he heads for the men's room... signaling to arch, who's waiting in line at the nacho stand. arch motions at the long line... all uniformed cops... shrugging helplessly.}
