<A>__{hunsecker has hung up. he stares at the telephone for a moment. then he moves towards susan's door, camera tracking with him. he comes to the threshold, looks at susan who is standing in much the same position in which sidney left her.}
<B>__{susan}
<A>__{unaware that her brother is watching her, she picks up the fur coat on the bed. (she is about to start packing her belongings.) she turns as she hears hunsecker speak.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{(over scene)}
<D>__{that's a pretty coat.}
<B>__{reverse angle}
<A>__{shooting across susan, towards hunsecker. hunsecker comes into the room.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{ but it's about time you had a new one.}
<A>__{susan turns squarely to face him.}

<A>__{she braces herself to tell him:}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(soberly)}
<D>__{i'm leaving, j.j.}
<B>__{resume reverse angle}
<A>__{he does not sense any danger in the seriousness of her tone (or, if he does, refuses to recognize it.)}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{(with a faint scoff)}
<D>__{don't kid a kidder. i will see you for breakfast around eleven.}
<A>__{without waiting for a response, hunsecker goes out, closing the door. susan stares at it for a moment. then she moves to get a small suitcase which she lays on the bed.}
<B>__{terrace}
<A>__{hunsecker opens the windows onto the terrace, comes out and looks over the parapet, (looking to see how far sidney has got, hoping to see kello's squad car.)}
<B>__{resume susan}
<A>__{she completes her simple packing, closing the suitcase. with a gesture that is obviously automatic, she starts to put on the fur coat; then she halts, realizing what she is doing. she pauses; camera moves closer. now, deliberately she throws the coat back on the bed. camera pans down with the gesture. she looks down at the coat, the discarded symbol of her dependence upon her brother. camera pulls back again as she takes a quick look round, then goes to take a duffle coat from the wardrobe. she throws this over her arm, picks up the suitcase, goes to the door.}
