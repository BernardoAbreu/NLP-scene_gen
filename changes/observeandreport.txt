<ACTION>__{A PERVERT in a trench coat runs along the edge of the mall. A group of OLD WOMEN is coming toward the MAIN ENTRANCE. The Pervert opens his trench coat and flashes the old women. They SCREAM! The Pervert ducks behind the bushes and runs with the skill of a Navy SEAL. A FAMILY is walking down the sidewalk. The Pervert opens his trench coat and flashes them. The Pervert ducks behind a dumpster. He keeps running and sees a car driving by. The Pervert flashes the CAR. The Pervert takes a two-step run, sees ANOTHER LADY, flashes her. He dives behind a car. Then pops up and flashes ANOTHER GIRL. It's an all-out Pervert assault! The Pervert then runs across the parking lot, jumps a fence, and darts from the property -- vanishing as quickly as a Ninja who just perfectly executed an assassination.}

One kid ollies onto the hood of a car. Another slams into an old man and knocks him over. Meanwhile, Ronnie sits in his golf cart -- waiting. He looks eerily like Mel Gibson at the beginning of Mad Max. The skaters ride past a set of construction cones. One skater picks up the cone and tosses it across the parking lot.

Ronnie is back in the chase and only Hector and Stevie are left. Ronnie guns the golf cart and zooms up closely behind the two kids. Ronnie rams Hector over and over from behind. Hector wobbles. Ronnie rams him again. Hector goes swerving off and falls down hard. Ronnie doesn't break his pace and guns it toward Stevie. Stevie is good. He turns and rides through cars, ollies over parking blocks, and through pedestrians. Ronnie burns down the lane beside him. Stevie looks behind and Ronnie is nowhere in sight.    He's in the clear.
