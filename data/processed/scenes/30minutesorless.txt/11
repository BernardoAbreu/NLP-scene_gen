<L>__{exterior small apartment building night}
<A>__{will sits on the darkened front stoop. he tosses an empty can into the bushes and gets to work on his fourth beer. he looks over at a parked hyundai elantra. a young man sits in the passenger seat with a pensive look on his face. he makes a sudden, surprised gasp. the homely young woman who was just blowing him sits up from his lap and rearranges herself in the driver seat. she leans over for a goodbye kiss. the young man obliges with much fanfare. the young man gets out and the car pulls away. this is chet (25), a clean cut guy dressed in the gap premium collection. he heads toward the building, high off his bj, humming outkast's "ms. jackson." he stops when he notices will in the shadows.}
