<L>__{interior task force room day (later)}
<A>__{m.j., ruben, nikko, and a number of other officers are being addressed by saks, an fbi agent. at the back are three more fbi agents, suited and tied. quinn stands off to one side. the song is just ending, on a cd player in the room. a projector beams up a copy of the note ruben found in the phone booth.}
<D>__{dr. hudson: don't lose your head. "once that you've decided on a killing first you make a stone of your heart and if you find that your hands are still willing you can turn murder into an art. well, if you have a taste for this experience you're flushed with your very first success then you must try a twosome or a threesome before your conscience bothers you much less. then you can join the ranks of the illustrious in history's great dark hall of fame all of our greatest killers were industrious at least the ones that we all know by name."}
<A>__{saks speaks...}
<C>__{saks}
<P>__{hello. i am (research title)}
<D>__{meryhew saks. the song is called "murder by numbers." the performers are a group called the police. adam here... ... from behavioral science is working out exactly what this perpetrator is trying to telegraph in the note. this is an extremely complex case, and we have a lot of fancy theories floating around. we're not ruling out the possib ility of three copycat serial killers. we have quantico working on graphology, the washington lap is cloning dna from the secretor. it's our feeling that the best lead we have is the two sperm samples in one of the victims. we have a team sweeping sperm banks. now i want to say a few word to you local people. your commissioner asked for our assistance. the bureau does not send us in on these cases to lord it over the local police. we couldn't catch up on what you people know if we had a year. we have nation wide resources and hard state of the art forensic science; you have the local savvy. together we can be unbeatable. which one is inspector halloran?}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{over here.}
<A>__{saks approaches m.j., guides her away from the others. two shot: saks is unctuous and insincere, self confident.}
<C>__{saks}
<D>__{we don't see too many lady homicide detectives. you have my respect. have you discussed the note with dr. hudson?}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{someone broke into her place last night. it wasn't connected to our case, but it shook her up pretty bad so i haven't...}
<A>__{quinn joins them, saks gives him a nod.}
<C>__{saks}
<D>__{i was just about to advise the inspector here not to show dr. hudson the note.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{sir, doctor hudson and i see a pattern develop...}
<C>__{saks}
<P>__{(riding over her)}
<D>__{we know helen. she's not exactly a credible collaborator. especially late in the day...}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{she takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.}
<C>__{saks}
<D>__{who prescribes the brandy?}
<A>__{m.j.'s look makes saks smile. quinn is called to the phone.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{how come you're so up on dr. hudson?}
<C>__{saks}
<D>__{she is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. giving lectures she's well paid for. her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{saks}
<D>__{we've put a tap on dr. hudson's phone. i know you won't mention it.}
<A>__{so much for any trusting relationship, right? quinn has arrived, addresses saks.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{sorry to interrupt. i need a word with my officer...}
<A>__{he turns to m.j. diplomatically, saks moves away.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{m.j., i'm going to have to borrow ruben. the alien smuggling thing in chinatown is going down tomorrow night and jack's kid got hit by a car. i gotta give ruben to nikko.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{what does this mean? now we got the fbi, my team is expendable? i'm working my ass off, is anybody listening? why ruben, anyway? he and nikko don't even get on together...}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self discipline.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{if this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{just, i need results. and i am short handed. who else am i gonna give him?}
<C>__{m.j.}
<P>__{(looking at saks)}
<D>__{give him that pompous son of a bitch.}
<A>__{she turns and leaves, brushing past saks as she goes... gigi meets her...}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{lab called. they got a result on the drug test you requested...?}
<A>__{it takes a moment to remember what it was...}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{they said it was windex?}
<A>__{if there was any residual doubt about what's happening, it's gone now. she starts after quinn, sees he is in spirited dialogue with saks and decides to wait.}
