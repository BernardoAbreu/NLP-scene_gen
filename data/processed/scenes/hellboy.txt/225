<L>__{interior hexagonal trap door pit day}
<A>__{bam!!! under his feet, a huge trapdoor falls open. he and manning drop through, along with the phonograph. hellboy grabs a rope. it spins through a copper pulley, but a large knot jerks him to a stop. hellboy snatches manning's hand, but loses his backpack. he looks down. the phonograph hits the ground with a crash.}
