<L>__{interior housewife's nice home day}
<A>__{the white woman and the black woman fly into the center of the living room, crashing onto her coffe table in front of the sofa. these two wildcats go at each other savagely, tumbling over the couch, clawing and scratching all the way, landing together on the plush carpet. the housewife kicks the bride, sending her crashing backwards into the small table where the phone, a note pad (for messages), and the mail is kept. the housewife scrambles up on her feet, but is caught by a flying tackle from behind by the bride that sends them both into........ an ornamental iron and tempered glass bookcase that has framed family photos, display toys, some african art, and a collection of painted commemorative plates depicting the negro experience in the american military. starting with a plate featuring cripis atkins in the revolutionary war, negro troops in union blue during the civil war, buffalo soldiers fighting indians, the jim crow troops of the first world war, the colored troops of world war two, korea, vietnam, and finally colin powell....the bride and the housewife crash through all this reducing everything to rubble. they land hard on the floor covered in broken glass, locked in grapple, each trying to get the best of the other one,... when the housewife headbutts the bride in the nose. the housewife hops off the bride, runs into the kitchen, opens a drawer and comes out with a huge motherfuckin butcher knife. the bride rises from the floor, and whips out a knife in a sheath hanging from her belt known as a sog. (a sog is a long, double edged knife that's as sharp as a razor, and is what navy seals use to kill humans with.) the bride backs up into the mess of the now totally demolished living room. the two woman stalk each other, each holding her blade, each looking like they know how to use it, each waiting for the other to make a mistake so they can plunge their blade deep into the other one. blood and sweat dript off of the faces of the two women locked in life and death combat...... ....when the back kitchen door opens, and a four year old little girl, carrying a lunch box steps inside.}
<D>__{four year old girl mommy, i'm home!}
<A>__{the two warrior women whose eyes reflect only combat concentration, suddenly switch upon hearing the four year old's voice. the housewife's eyes flash a look of pleading to the eyes of the bride. the bride seems to answer back; "okay." the black woman and the white woman hide their edged weapons behind their backs, as the four year old little girl walks into the newly destroyed living room. the housewife switches to her mommy voice.}
<C>__{the housewife}
<D>__{hey baby, how was school?}
<A>__{the little girl is flabbergasted at the mess, and the condition of her mother, who looks like she's just been in a bar room brawl.}

<D>__{mommy, what happened to you and the t.v. room?}
<C>__{the housewife}

<C>__{little girl}
<D>__{barney did this?}
<A>__{she says it with the slightest hint of skepticism, then tries to enter the living room.}
<C>__{the housewife}
<D>__{now baby, you can't come in here, there's broken glass all over the floor, and you gonna cut yourself.}
<A>__{the little girl's eyes go to the blonde lady in the living room who she ain't never seen before, who also looks like she's been fighting. the bride smiles at the confused little girl.}
<C>__{the housewife}
<D>__{this is a old friend of mommy's i ain't seen in a long time.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{hello sweety, i'm (bleep), what's your name?}
<A>__{whenever during the picture somebody says the bride's real name, it will be bleeped out on the soundtrack, ...that is, till i want you to know. the shy, suspicious little girl doesn't say anything, she just stares at the blond lady.}
<C>__{the housewife}
<D>__{her name is nikki.}

<A>__{the child doesn't move, so the mother repeats herself.}
<C>__{the housewife}
<P>__{(snapping her fingers)}
<D>__{nikkia in your room now.}
<A>__{the little girl slowly walks away and disappears behind the door of her bedroom. the two women turn to face each other, masquerade and combat both finished.}
<C>__{the housewife}
<D>__{want some coffee?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{yeah, sure.}
<A>__{the two women move into the kitchen. the bride re sheaths her sog, and the housewife puts the butcher knife back in the drawer. the bride sits down at the kitchen table, while the housewife pours both of them coffee.}
<C>__{the housewife}
<D>__{cream and sugar?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{both, please.}
<A>__{as the housewife fixes the coffee, we hear the bride's}
