<L>__{exterior desolate german inn late afternoon}
<A>__{roderick and captain galgenstein approach a very lonely looking place.}
<C>__{captain galgenstein}
<D>__{this is a very good inn. shall we stop for dinner?}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{this may be a very good inn for germany, but it would not pass in old ireland. corbach is only a league off, let us push on for corbach.}
<C>__{captain galgenstein}
<D>__{do you want to see the loveliest woman in europe?}
<A>__{roderick smiles.}
<C>__{captain galgenstein}
<D>__{ah! you sly rogue, i see that will influence you.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{the place seems more a farm than an inn yard.}
<C>__{captain galgenstein}
<D>__{the people are great farmers, as well as inn keepers.}
<A>__{they enter by a great gate into a court, walled round, and at on end of which is the building, a dingy ruinous place. a couple of covered wagons are in the courtyard; their horses are littered under a shed hard by. lounging about the place are some men, and a pair of sergeants in the prussian uniform, who both touch their hats to the captain. the inn has something foreboding about it, and the men shut the great yard gates as soon as they enter.}
<C>__{captain galgenstein}
<P>__{(explaining the gate)}
<D>__{parties of french horsemen are about the country, and one cannot take too many precautions against such villains.}
<A>__{the two sergeant take charge of the horses; the captain orders one of them to take roderick's valise to his bedroom. roderick promises the sergeant a glass of schnapps for his pains. they enter into supper.}
