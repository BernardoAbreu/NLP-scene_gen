<A>__{from the back of the darkened empty church, we see him mount the altar. a priest in fact. martin's hands open the gilded doors to reveal the chalice. he removes it, squirts a clear liquid into the cup, and swishes it out. he returns the chalice to the cabinet.}
<C>__{martin }
<D>__{the church seems to be purging itself of it's pedophile.}
<B>__{martin}
<A>__{sits in the back pew of the church, now crowded for mann. he watches the priest lift the chalice into the air, murmur a prayer, and drink from it. the priest collapses behind the altar.}
<C>__{martin }
<D>__{it's a bull market.}
<B>__{c.u. of altar carpet}
<A>__{the chalice bounces free from the priest's hand as it hits the ground.}
<C>__{martin }
<D>__{anyway, that never use to happen. i was always the prodigy. now i'm just one of the guys.}
