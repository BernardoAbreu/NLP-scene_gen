<A>__{a young hawaiian shirt wearing man named pete sits on a stool behind the counter. a few close up:stomers fiddle about. a man wearing a black suit, black tie, and wire rim glasses holds hands with a pretty blonde girl in cutoffs and bare feet. they look through magazines. another black suit wearing man holds hands with a red headed girl in a prep school uniform. they look through the beer cooler in the back of the store. both girls are around seventeen. mcgraw enters the store.}

<D>__{not even for lunch?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.}
<A>__{mcgraw walks over to the beer cooler, as if done ritually every night (it is), takes out a beer, pops it open and joins pete by the front counter.}
<C>__{mcgraw}
<D>__{jesus christ man, that microwave food will kill ya as quick as a bullet. those burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed. pull me down a bottle of jack daniels. i'm gettin' tanked tonight.}

<C>__{pete}
<D>__{isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public?}
<C>__{mcgraw}
<D>__{well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. who knows what goes on inside mongoloid's mind?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{you could sue the shit out of her, ya know. that kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin' burgers. you could own that fuckin' place.}
<C>__{mcgraw}
<D>__{what the hell would i do with that grease pit? besides, nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. then all this abilene shit happened. you heard about that bank robbery in abilene, didn't ya?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{that's all that's been on the box all day. they killed some people didn't they?}
<C>__{mcgraw}
<D>__{four rangers, three cops, and two civilians. and they took a lady bank teller as a hostage.}
<A>__{pete doesn't say anything.}
<C>__{mcgraw}
<D>__{they'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. and if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. we'll get 'em all right. i gotta piss. i'm gonna use your commode.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{knock yourself out.}
<A>__{mcgraw drops his last drip of beer, crushes the can and exits in the bathroom. the black suited man by the beer cooler turns around and, with the prep school girl in tow, walks rapidly toward pete. we see that the girl is crying.}
<D>__{black suited man #1}
<P>__{(to pete)}
<D>__{do you think i'm fuckin' playing with you, asshole?}
<P>__{(points to the tearful prep school girl)}
<D>__{do you want this little girl to die?}
<P>__{(pointing to the blonde with the other guy)}
<D>__{or that little girl? or your bosombuddy with the badge? or yourself? i don't wanna do it, but i will turn this fuckin' store into the wild bunch if i even think you're fuckin' with me.}
<A>__{the two men in black suits are the notorious abilene bank robbers, seth and richard gecko, "the gecko brothers." and the other customers are all being held hostage. seth is the one with the prep girl. richard is the one with the blonde. everybody speaks low and fast.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{what do you want from me? i did what you said.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{letting him use your toilet? no store does that.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{he comes in here every day and we bullshit. he's used my toilet a thousand times. if i told him no, he'd know something was up.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i want that son of a bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to "benny's world of blood."}
<A>__{richard, holding tightly the hand of the terrified girl, leans next to seth's ear and whispers something. seth looks at pete.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{were you giving that pig signals?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{what? are you kidding? i didn't do anything!}
<A>__{richard whispers something else in seth's ear.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{he says you were scratching.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i wasn't scratching!}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{you callin' him a liar?}
<A>__{pete controls himself.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i'm not calling him a liar, okay? i'm simply saying that if i was scratching, and if i did scratch, it's not because i was signaling the cop, it's because i'm fuckin' scared shitless.}
<A>__{richard speaks for the first time in a low calm voice to seth.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{the ranger's taking a piss. why don't i just go in there, blow his head off and get outta here.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{don't do that! look, you asked me to act natural, and i'm acting as natural in fact, under the circumstances, i think i ought get a fuckin' academy award for how natural i'm acting. you asked me to get rid of him, i'm doing my best.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{yeah, well, your best better get a helluva lot fuckin' better, or you're gonna feel a helluva fuckin' lot worse.}
<A>__{the toilet flushes.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{everybody be cool.}
<A>__{everybody goes back to what they were doing. mcgraw steps back out of the back. he appears to be unaware of the situation.}
<C>__{mcgraw}
<D>__{yeah, and i'm gonna be right back at it tomorrow. so tonight i'm gonna sit in front of the box and just drink booze. how much is the bottle?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{six fifty.}
<A>__{out of nowhere richard whips out his forty five automatic and shoots mcgraw in the head. mcgraw goes down screaming. richard stands over him and shoots him twice more. seth charges forward.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(to richard)}
<D>__{what the fuck was that about?}
<C>__{richard}
<P>__{(in a low monotone)}
<D>__{he signaled the ranger.}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(hysterical)}
<D>__{i didn't.}
<P>__{(to seth)}
<D>__{you gotta believe me, i didn't.}
<C>__{richard}
<P>__{(to seth)}
<D>__{when they were talkin', he mouthed the words "help us."}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{you fuckin' liar, i didn't say shit!}
<A>__{richard shoots pete and pete falls down behind the counter. seth grabs richard and throws him up against the wall.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{what the fuck is wrong with you }
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{seth, he did it. you were by the beer cooler with your back turned. i was by the magazines, i could see his face. and i saw him mouth:}
<A>__{richard mouths the words, "help us." while pete lies on the floor behind the counter bleeding from his bullet wound, he opens his floor safe and pulls out a gun from it. seth releases his brother.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{start the car.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{you believe me don't cha?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{shut up and start the car.}
<A>__{richard walks away from seth and crosses the counter... ...when pete springs up, gun in hand, and shoots richard in the hand. richard falls to his knees, howling. both pete and seth spray the store with gunfire. seth dives down an aisle. he reloads. pete ducks behind the counter. he reloads. richard has crawled to safety behind an aisle. the two girls have run out screaming.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{richie? you okay?}
<C>__{richard}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{i'm not dead, but i'm definitely shot! i told you that bastard said, "help us!"}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{i never said help us!}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{well that don't matter now, 'cause you got about two fuckin' seconds to live! richie!}
<C>__{richard}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{when i count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{gotcha!}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{one... two... three.}
<A>__{the two brothers start firing toward the counter. they hit the bottles of alcohol on the shelf behind pete. pete is crouched on the ground as glass, debris and alcohol rain down on him. seth grabs a roll of paper towels from off a shelf. richard keeps firing. seth douses the paper towels with lighter fluid, sets it on fire with his zippo, then tosses it. the flaming roll of paper towels flies through the air. the fireball lands behind the counter. the entire counter area immediately bursts into flames. pete screams from behind the counter. seth smiles to himself and stands. richard shakes his head in amusement and stands. pete runs out from behind the counter, engulfed in flames still holding his weapon and firing. seth and richard hit the ground firing their .45's. pete, the human torch, falls like a tree into the hostess pastry display. seth and richard rise from the rubble.}
