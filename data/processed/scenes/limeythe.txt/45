<L>__{exterior oceanfront. night.}
<A>__{they walk along the seafront. we hear the ocean but can't see it.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{when did you get in?}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{yesterday. afternoon.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(occurs to her)}
<D>__{you haven't been lurking outside my building all day.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{no, i had some other matters to attend to, you know. getting a car sorted ...}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{i might've been away for the weekend.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{well, i reckoned, saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{and you've seen eddie rama.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{yeah, saw eddie, yeah. me and him are muckers.}
<A>__{mates. friends. makes a kind of bonding gesture.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{i should really give him a call. he's a character, isn't he. well, not to you. i meant to us squares in the outside world.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{he give me your address.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{i gave him yours. said, here, you want to write, i think this is a relative. i guess i thought i was being true to jenny. who told me she didn't have a father before proceeding of course to tell me why.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life. on her own after her mum died. aunts and uncles for a time and then the bright lights beckoned.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{were you still married at the time to jenny's mother, i mean?}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{nah, we split up when jenny was six. her second husband done a runner after she got sick. they give me compassionate leave from parkhurst to go visit her in hospital. we were always mates, me and jenny's mum. i like to think they're together again now. y'know. heavenly choir.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{the address jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it?}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{nah, accommodation address.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{what's that, like a p.o. box.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{something like that, yeah.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{where you get your bank statements.}
<A>__{wilson gives a laugh.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{well, you gotta have something permanent, don'tcha. even if it's a hole in the wall. no matter which jug i might be transferred to, i always got someone on the out checks up on it for me, see. anything i need to know, comes round on visitor's day word in my ear.}
<A>__{elaine pauses.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{some word.}
<A>__{wilson leans on the wall overlooking the black ocean. sound of waves gently lapping the beach.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{i already knew. knew beforehand. when was it supposed to have happened? two o'clock in the morning, eddie said.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(watching him)}
<D>__{that's what was estimated.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{eight hours difference between here and london. would've been, what, ten in the morning, my time. i was just coming out on the yard. now, i was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then. bit of fresh air, stretch me legs well, stretch the day out, really, that's what you wanna do. and i will tell ya: i couldn't open the paper. could not pry the pages apart it was like they was glued together. that's how weak my hands went. thought i was having heart attack, only i knew i wasn't. bloke come up to me, he says, dave, he says, you've gone all white. i said, fuck me, i've been in prison half my life, what d'ya expect. but he was dead on, 'cause i could feel the blood drain right out of me head. and i knew ...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{something had happened to jen.}
<A>__{they stand here a while. listening to the breakers hit the shore.}
