<A>__{tatum and sidney make their way across campus.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{just relax. you're at school now. no one can get you here.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{but if it wasn't billy it could be anybody. he could be here at school right now.}
<A>__{they move up the walk as a figure falls in step behind them, sporting a white ghost mask.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{serial killers are smart by definition. they minimize their risk. they plan and pre calculate everything. showing up here would be the most lame brain move he could make.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{he promised me he'd be back.}
<A>__{as easy as the figure appeared, it disappears falling out of site, unseen by either of them.}
<C>__{tatum}
<D>__{i wouldn't put too much stock in a psycho's promise.}
<A>__{they move up the front steps toward the main doors of the school as the ghost masked figure reappears...standing at the top of the steps...sidney sees it first, stopping dead in her tracks. she steps back, spinning around to find... a ghost face behind her as well, both of them approaching, closing in on her. sidney starts to scream when the two ghosts bust up laughing, tearing off across campus.}
