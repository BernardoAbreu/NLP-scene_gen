<A>__{the room is badly lit. there is a mattress on the floor, and another on the table, a cupboard against the wall, some chairs. nothing else. at the back of the room to the left, there is a dividing curtain hung by a cord at medium height. the curtain is drawn and a large bed with brass headboards is visible. the algerian points in that direction; the captain signals for him to go there. they go forward silently, and push aside the curtain. there is a small light bulb hung on the wall beneath a small shelf covered with postcards and photos. the baseboard all around is more than three feet tall and is covered by majolica tiles. the algerian points to a spot in the brick structure, on the back wall, between the headboard of the bed and a corner of the room. marc and the captain have their machine guns ready. the captain goes near the wall, his breath drawn, and begins to examine it. he runs the fingernail of his thumb along the wall horizontally, between one row of tiles and another. he taps the tiles at different places until he hears the plaster in the interstices crumble. he looks at the bit of plaster that is left in his nail. he squeezes it in his fingertips; it is soft, newly laid. then he bends over, places his ear to the wall, and listens. suddenly he smiles.}
