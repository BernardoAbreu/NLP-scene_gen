<A>__{jean stretches out her fists and focuses her telekinesis. pyro spots jean with one hand continuing to blast cyclops, he uses the other to unleash an arm of fire toward jean. jean focuses as she brings her outstretched fists closer together. suddenly the two fire extinguishers crash through their glass holders. like two gunslingers in a showdown. the extinguishers bullet toward pyro. the arm of fire rockets closer to jean. suddenly, the extinguishers collide exploding in front of pyro. inches from jean's face, the arm of fire disappears. the column of flames against scott vanishes. the flames once covering the room are gone, a choking smoke is all that remains. through the smoke, at the center of the old torch, pyro lies dead, covered in a sea of white foam. jean starts choking on the smoke. cyclops stands and motions for her to get out of the smoke filled room.}
