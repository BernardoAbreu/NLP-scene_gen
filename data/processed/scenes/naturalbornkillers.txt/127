<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(talking in rhyme)}
<D>__{i stand amid the roar of a surf tormented shore, as i hold within my hand grains of the golden sand how few! yet how they creep through my fingers to the deep, while i weep while i weep! o god! can i not save one from the pitiless wave? is all that we see or seem but a dream within a dream?}
<A>__{mickey bites into the donut.}
<C>__{mickey}
