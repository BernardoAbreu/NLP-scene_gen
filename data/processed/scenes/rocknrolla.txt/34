<A>__{it's the next morning, we see one two running. mumbles and handsome bob pull up along side of him in their car. there is a moment of pause while they admire one two running along side of them.}
<C>__{mumbles}
<D>__{don't you get bored of that? i mean, your not really going anywhere. if you wanna run, why don't you run to the shops or do something useful?}
<C>__{one two}
<D>__{you could do with some of this yourself mumbles, you're letting yourself go.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{anyway, i'm busy, have you come to talk about anything important?}
<C>__{mumbles}
<D>__{it's all about the zone isn't it?}
<C>__{mumbles }
<D>__{you boys and girls like to find funny places in your head where nothing can get you, don't you? you're scared, you're running away from yourself one two.}
<C>__{one two}

<C>__{handsome bob}
<D>__{i'm good with the posh ones, don't you worry about that.}
