<L>__{exterior quadrangle day}
<B>__{close shot private friday clark}
<A>__{he is blowing the bugle, sounding pay call. the rays of a blinding sun flash on its shiny surface.}
<L>__{interior mess hall day}
<B>__{medium shot}
<A>__{the bugle is heard over shot. a line of spruced up men stretches through the mess hall. a blanket is spread over a table and behind it sits holmes, flanked by warden and mazzioli. in front of holmes is a pile of greenbacks and a cigar box filled with silver. he is paying out the man at the head of the line.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{ and just see you don't drink all this up in one place.}
<A>__{the man smiles, appreciating the whimsy, salutes, moves off.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{prewitt.}
<A>__{prew, next in line, steps up to the table.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{robert e. lee, ra 345071.}
<A>__{he is crisp, sharp, expressionless. he holds out his hands for fingernail inspection. holmes looks them over, then up at the perfect knot in his tie. he stares at prew as if trying to fathom him.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{have you given any thought to the boxing team recently, prewitt?}
<C>__{prew}
<P>__{(tonelessly)}
<D>__{i feel the same way, sir.}
<A>__{holmes' hands clench. he seems about to fly into a rage when he senses a motion at his side. he turns to see warden looking straight at him. warden's face has the same meaningfully expressionless look as prew's. holmes wilts before it, turns to mazzioli.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{what's this man's pay?}
<C>__{mazzioli}
<P>__{(reading from payroll)}
<D>__{private prewitt, thirty dollars base pay. deductions laundry, insurance, px checks.}
<A>__{camera moves in to close shot of holmes# hands laying money out on blanket.}
