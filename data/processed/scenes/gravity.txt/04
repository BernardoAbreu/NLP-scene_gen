<C>__{matt}
<D>__{ryan!}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{you're not going anywhere, you're not going anywhere }
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{it's not up to you.}
<A>__{matt begins to unharness the tether.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{please don't do this.}
<A>__{matt has unhooked the tether and is holding it in his hand.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{please don't do this. please don't do this.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you're going to make it ryan.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{he opens his hand, letting go of the tether, and begins to float}
<B>__{away.}
<A>__{relieved of matt's pull, the parachute begins to retrieve, pulling ryan closer to the station.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{i had you! i had you.}
<A>__{matt drifts away from the station into the empty space. ryan bumps against the station, pulled by the parachute, and she twists and turns before finally grabbing hold of a rail.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(on radio)}
<D>__{ryan do you copy? do you copy?}
<A>__{an alarm goes off.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{my co2 alarm went off. my co2 alarm went off.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you need to board the station. can you see the airlock?}
<A>__{she turns, looking for the station's airlock.}
<C>__{mat}
<D>__{do you copy?}
<P>__{(p.o.v shot beginning to blur)}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{yes. yes. i see it. i see it.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(on radio)}
<D>__{good. that's where you want to go. you're losing focus, right?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{that's because you're breathing co2 and you're losing consciousness. you need to board the station.}
<A>__{her eyes flutter...}
<C>__{matt }
<P>__{(on radio)}
<D>__{move!}
<A>__{ryan blinks, turns off the alarm, and begins climbing over a module of the station.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{the transmission becomes weaker, filled with static.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(on radio)}
<D>__{now listen to me. that second soyuz is too damaged for re entry, but it's perfectly fine for a little sunday drive.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{sunday drive...?}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(on radio)}
<D>__{look to the west... you see that dot in the distance? that is the chinese station. you're going to take the soyuz and cruise over there. the chinese lifeboat is a shenzou.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i've never flown a shenzhou }
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(on radio)}
<D>__{that doesn't matter. its re entry protocol is identical to the soyuz's }
<A>__{she nods, already looking.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{ok.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(on radio)}
<D>__{you've never flown a soyuz either.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{only on a simulator.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(on radio)}
<D>__{so then you know.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i crashed it. i }
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(on radio)}
<D>__{it's a simulator. that's what it's designed for.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{every time. i crashed the simulator every time.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(on radio)}
<D>__{it's not rocket science. just point the damn thing at earth and by this time tomorrow you'll be back in lake zurich with one hell of a story to tell. you copy? ryan. you copy?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i'm going to take the soyuz and come get you.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{no you're not. . i have too much of a head start. that ship already sailed.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{no. i'm coming to get you.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{ryan, you're going to have to learn to let go.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{but... i...}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(on radio)}
<D>__{i want to hear you say you're going to make it.}
<A>__{ryan is struggling for breath.}
<C>__{matt }
<P>__{(on radio)}
<D>__{ryan! say it!}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i'm... i'm going to make it.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{alright. keep going}
<A>__{ryan stares at matt's tiny figure in the distance.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{what kind of name is ryan for a girl?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{dad wanted a boy.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{are you close to the airlock?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{not yet.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{keep going.}
<A>__{ryan continues to the airlock.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{so, now that we have some distance between us you're attracted to me, aren't you?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{well, people say i have beautiful blue eyes.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{you... you have beautiful... you have beautiful blue eyes.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i have brown eyes... that hurts.}
<A>__{she looks at matt's figure receding.}
<C>__{matt }
<P>__{(on radio)}
<D>__{you wanna know the good news?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(on radio)}
<D>__{i'm going to break anatoly's record, and i think mine's going to stand for a long, long time.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{no... i'm coming to get you.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you know, ryan is a nice name for a girl. wow, you should see the sun on the ganges. it's amazing.}
<A>__{ryan starts to respond, then falters, watching matt's figure grow ever smaller. the sad crooning of hank williams crackles through the dying radio.}
<C>__{ryan}
<P>__{(in a daze)}
<D>__{matt...}
<A>__{only static hisses...}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{matt!}
<A>__{static again as matt falls deeper into the distance, becoming lost in a sea of white specks and the transmission ends.}
<C>__{silence}
<A>__{inside the helmet ryan is dizzy, sweating, and having trouble focusing. she sees}
<D>__{matt }
<A>__{nothing more than a dot. she stretches her hand toward him, as if trying to touch him with the tips of her fingers. but the dot has already vanished into never ending darkness.}
<B>__{everything is blurred.}
<A>__{ryan is about to lose consciousness, when a new alarm goes off. she takes one deep breath as she opens her eyes widely. if she doesn't move, she'll die. ryan pulls herself forward, reaching for a handle on the soyuz. she grabs it and reaches for another, climbing her way toward the station's airlock. but she's losing focus. as her right hand is reaching for a handle, everything becomes a blur, and she misses. inside the helmet her brain is shutting down from lack of oxygen. she struggles to open her eyes and mumbles words that are unintelligible. she reaches up again, almost blindly. her hand grips the handle, and with one huge effort she sprints across the docking module, swinging from handle to handle, in one continual push, until she reaches the }
<B>__{airlock.}
<A>__{she stops, takes one deep breath and she turns the latch and opens the re entry hatch. the hatch blows open as the air inside the cabin escapes into the vacuum, almost throwing ryan back into space, but she holds tightly onto the latch. she hangs outside, trying to gasp the last breath of oxygen inside her life system. she sees her feet dangling against the emptiness of space and with one last effort, she pulls herself into the airlock. airlock module. international space station. 500 km above earth. as she enters she does a 180 degree flip. as soon as her legs are in, she grabs onto the latch, and }
<B>__{closes the hatch.}
<A>__{she turns the latch and }
<B>__{the cabin is sealed off.}
<A>__{inside the helmet ryan is suffocating. with very little oxygen and her body intoxicated by the nitrogen in her blood, her breathing is coarse and painful. she can hardly keep her eyes open, and she pushes herself through the cabin, an empty cylinder lit by two circular mercury lights. she reaches the control panel, a small computer with a screen that monitors the atmospheric and temperature levels inside the airlock. she presses a button on the panel and }
<B>__{the cabin begins to pressurize.}
<A>__{a low hissing sound can be heard as the tanks in the station begin pumping pure oxygen into the airlock. the control panel's monitor shows the atmospheric levels slowly rising. inside the helmet ryan gasps for air, but there is none. she stares at the red orange green graph on the control panel showing the atmospheric levels. it reads red. her pupils begin to dilate as sound begins to surface in the vacuum of space there was nothing to carry sound waves, but now sound begins to travel through the oxygen that slowly fills the cabin. the sounds are muffled, like the sounds of the outside world heard from within the womb. a beeping sound intermittently penetrates the airlock, anxious and halting. the control system's graph slowly moves from red to orange. the cabin is still not fully pressurized. but that will have to do. with one sharp motion she takes off her helmet and pushes it from her head. she gasps for air and coughs. she contorts and shakes, fighting to breath in the thin atmosphere of the airlock. her helmet bounces around the walls of the cabin, floating. the beeping sound has become clearer and recognizable it is an alarm ringing out across the station. orange is turning to green. her lungs begin to absorb the oxygen and her breath becomes more even. her body floats, relaxed in the confined space of the airlock.}
<B>__{she floats.}
<A>__{ryan brings her hands together and removes one glove. and then the other. desperately, she begins to unscrew the lock near her waist. she squirms under the suit and pushes off the upper half. then she throws off the lower half, squirming out of it as if shedding her old skin, desperate to free herself from the claustrophobia of the suit. wearing only underwear and a t shirt, she floats in mid air, relieved and exhausted. the hum of the space station surrounds her. then, slowly, she pulls her knees to her chest and enfolds them in her arms, floating in a fetal position. for a moment, ryan simply hangs in suspension, a fly in amber, surrendering to the poetry of the planets, rotating slowly in the cabin's womb. outer space. 500 km above the earth.}
<B>__{silence.}
<A>__{the international space station, with its modules, its torn solar panels, and the soyuz with its parachute billowing out from its center, is dwarfed against earth's orb and the infinite universe stretching out beyond. the station looks frail and secluded, lost somewhere between the grandness of the heavens and the earth below. everything is still.}
