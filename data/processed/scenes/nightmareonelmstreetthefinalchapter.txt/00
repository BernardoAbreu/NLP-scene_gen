<A>__{jacob johnson is sleeping. it doesn't look like a pleasant experience. he is sixteen, dirty blonde, his eyes visibly moving under closed lids as he sits huddle under a blanket in his window seat. the lights are dim the shade on the window closed a bead of sweat dribbles down his forehead. the humming of the jet's engines vibrates through the cabin. the boy's eyes snap open. jacob glances around nervously. he looks like an escaped convict who just accidentally walked into the policemen's ball. a greyhaired man two seats away from him gives the teenager a cursory glance, then goes back to his book. jacob lays his head back and tries to relax. the engines continue to drone. until a new noise starts. a whooshing noise. the sound is very fainterior but distinct from everything else. jacob frowns. the noise gets louder. jacob's sure he's hearing it now. he looks at the greyhaired man. the man catches his eye and the two of them stare at each other for a heartbeat then jacob turns away. the man returns to his book. and jacob immediately turns back to him.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{do you hear that?}
<A>__{the man gives him an annoyed look as the whooshing gets louder.}
<C>__{greyhaired man}
<D>__{hear what?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{that noise.}
<C>__{greyhaired man}
<D>__{i don't hear anything.}
<A>__{the man turns back to the book as the sound gets even louder like it's coming closer. jacob squirms in his seat sneaks a look at the man again. how can he not hear that? a stewardess walks by and jacob catches her attention.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<C>__{stewardess}
<D>__{yes?}
<A>__{the whooshing is completely obvious now. the greyhaired man tries to ignore the two people talking over him.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what is that sound?}
<C>__{stewardess}
<D>__{that's just the engines, sir.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no, it's different. it's not the engines. it's getting louder.}
<A>__{the man sighs the stewardess smiles patronizingly.}
<C>__{stewardess}
<D>__{we're just gaining altitude to get above some rough weather. that's the sound of the engines speeding up a bit. everything's fine.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{um...okay.}
<A>__{the stewardess walks away as jacob sits back and starts to bite his nails. the whooshing is really starting to blare now. he looks between the seats in front of him twists around to look behind. he snaps back to the greyhaired man.}
<C>__{jacob }
<D>__{can't you hear that?}
<C>__{greyhaired man}
<P>__{(losing patience)}
<D>__{look, kid. will you relax? it's just the damn engines, okay?}
<A>__{the man glares at him, and jacob backs off. the sound has grown deafening. jacob grinds his seat like he's going mad. he looks at the closed window. he reaches out his hand, grabs the handle then rips up the shade for all to see: a 747 coming right at us. jacob screams. the planes crash. impact decompression explosion. the hull of the cabin buckles violently moaning like a dying elephant peeling inward revealing red and green striping on the outside. a huge wing section rips through the structure barely missing jacob taking the greyhaired man's head clean off nailing the stewardess in the gut and shoving her body across and out the other side of the cabin. and jacob's seat drops down sending him and us into:}
