<A>__{wesker has been exploring the corridor. stopping in front of the elevator, he shines his light into the car. we expect someone... or some thing... to be lurking inside. an attack comes from the opposite direction. a figure bursts out of the shadows behind weasker. another zombie? no. it's jill! in a rage, she holds her pistol to wesker's head.}
