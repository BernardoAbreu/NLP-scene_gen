<A>__{ard's throne room the beast captain keeps his machine gun trained on den as the soldiers lead him into the cavernous room.}
<C>__{dan}
<P>__{(v.o.)}
<D>__{they split us up and took me to this weird castle type place. i wanted to find out where they'd taken katherine, but none of these guys seemed to speak english.}
<A>__{in the middle of the room there is a round stone pedestal with a throne carved into it. on the throne sits ard, a child like ruler with a sadistic glint in his eye.}
<C>__{ard}
<D>__{they tell me you are den of earth, the one who dared to steal the female sacrifice from the queen.}
<C>__{dan}
<P>__{(v.o.)}
<D>__{this guy was a shrimp so i figured i'd play it tough.}
<C>__{den}
<D>__{where is the girl?}
<C>__{ard}
<D>__{i am ard supreme leader of the revolution and the next ruler of the world.}
<C>__{den}
<P>__{(tougher)}
<D>__{the girl!!}
<C>__{ard}
<D>__{well, aren't we fierce? if you are truly as tough as you seem, then you will serve me well. but first, a test. guards! castrate him!}
<C>__{dan}
<P>__{(v.o.)}
<D>__{uh oh.}
<A>__{two bestial guards approach from behind, brandishing curved short swords. den turns instinctively, dodges the first thrust and delivers a bone shattering elbow to the beast's head, crushing his skull. spinning with his own momentum, den throws a rock hard fist into the second guard's chest, snapping his rib cage and sending him flying across the room. without pausing, the bald muscleman grabs the nearby beast captain and lifts him into the air by his machine gun. the captain hangs on as den twists the gun, butts it into the creature's groin and then drives the weapon through the captain's jaw. the creature crumples, leaving den with the gun.}
<C>__{dan}
<P>__{(v.o.)}
<D>__{boy! i was pretty good at this stuff.}
<C>__{ard}
<D>__{excellent. you are worthy to serve me.}
<C>__{den}
<P>__{(aiming machine gun at him)}
<D>__{give me the girl or die.}
<C>__{ard}
<P>__{(taking it lightly)}
<D>__{well, if i have a choice, i will take death.}
<C>__{den}
<D>__{so be it.}
<A>__{den fires, spraying a row of bullets across ard's body. the bullets blast big yellow holes in ard's chest, but there is no blood. ard looks up and laughs.}
<C>__{ard}
<D>__{ha ha ha! you'll have to do better than that.}
<A>__{as den looks on, ard's wounds miraculously close up and heal themselves over.}
<C>__{dan}
<P>__{(v.o.)}
<D>__{i could see why they made this guy their leader.}
<C>__{ard}
<P>__{(standing up)}
<D>__{... but if you're really interested in the girl; i've had her encased in glass.}
<A>__{ard pulls the velvet covering off of a glass box to reveal katherine, unconscious, sealed inside.}
<C>__{den}
<D>__{she's dead.}
<C>__{ard}
<D>__{actually no. she's sleeping, but only i can awaken her.}
<C>__{den}
<D>__{what do you want of me?}
<C>__{ard}
<D>__{i want you to steal the sacred loc nar.}
<C>__{den}
<D>__{what is this loc nar?}
<C>__{ard}
<D>__{the queen's glowing sphere, you fool. the sacrifice to uluhtec can only be performed by the possessor of the sacret loc nar.}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{norl!}
<A>__{norl, a huge gorilla man, in a purple cloak, steps forward.}
<C>__{ard}
<P>__{(to den)}
<D>__{this is norl, my bravest warrior. you will go with him to the queen's castle and steal the loc nar. then i will give you the girl.}
<C>__{den}
<D>__{and if i refuse?}
<C>__{ard}

<A>__{den looks down at katherine's motionless body.}
