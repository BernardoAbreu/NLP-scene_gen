<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior worstick town hall (present day)}
<A>__{an auditorium has been transformed with colored lights and strung paper into a small town party. teenagers in period dress control the floor, dancing to a decidedly un period rock band. the older guests are gathered around the punch bowl talking crops or pennsylvania politics.}
<B>__{brenna}
<A>__{fitted as well as can be expected in her lace dress, enters with taupin, himself dressed in a formal suit complete with cape. his clothes fit perfectly. mr. north, comically dressed as a pirate, greets them.}
<C>__{mr. north}
<D>__{mr. taupin! glad you could make it. best get some punch before it's gone. near the whole valley showed up.}

<C>__{woman}
<D>__{if i didn't know better i'd say william taupin.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{his son. richard.}
<C>__{mr. north}
<D>__{mr. taupin is up from washington to look over his father's estate.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{your father died some years ago. this is your first visit?}
<A>__{the tone is snide.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{of sorts.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{i suppose a taupin had to show up eventually.}
<P>__{(walks away)}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{good evening, mrs. butler.}

<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{what was all that about?}
<C>__{mr. north}
<D>__{sorry mr. taupin. that's not meant for you. just some didn't take much to your father.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{my father was never one for social whirls.}
<C>__{mr. taupin}
<D>__{kept to himself for sure. then with all that business in '31.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{what business?}
<C>__{mr. north}
<D>__{family down the road from the taupin place was murdered. all cut up they were. horrible. two strangers were also found with the bodies. no one ever accused william, but with his reputation as a loner and the rumors about him and some of the wives in town, folks just never forgot. most were relieved when they heard he'd died. sorry mr. taupin.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{nothing to be sorry about.}
<C>__{mr. north}
<D>__{just your pappy scared some.}
<A>__{the rock band finished as a portly man in a union soldier's uniform takes the microphone.}
<C>__{portly}
<D>__{all right, the kids have had their fun. now it's time for a little more traditional dancing.}
<A>__{the rock band gives ground to a group of older musicians. with a nod from the union soldier they begin a folk tune with fiddles and hammer dulcimer. the costumed guests take to the floor.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{i don't know any of these. i will make a fool of myself.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{follow me.}
<A>__{taupin starts into it with perfect grace. a faltering brenna tries to keep up.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{william taupin seems to have left his mark.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{and you are william taupin, aren't you?}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{they do a final turn and finish. the other dancers applaud.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{you're using your son's name.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{no. just the child of some lonely girl i gave a ride to. when they died i put them in a grave with my name on it. twenty years later i became the son.}
<A>__{brenna is staring at him.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{more punch?}
<A>__{he leads her to a table.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{then you must be at least 70 years old.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{at least.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{that's impossible.}
<A>__{several of the elderly women are watching taupin from across the room.}
