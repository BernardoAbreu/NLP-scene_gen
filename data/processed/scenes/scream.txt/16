<L>__{exterior window}
<A>__{sidney sticks her head out the window. the late night wind hits her face as a shadow appears just to the left of her, a hand reaches out, grabs her and suddenly a figure is on top of her...}

<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{my dad's in the other room.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{i will only stay a sec.}
<A>__{suddenly... the bedroom door bursts open. the doorknob catches on the open closet door behind it jamming it, holding it in place.}
<C>__{voice}
<P>__{(from behind door)}
<D>__{what's going on in there?}
<A>__{billy quickly rolls out of sight behind the bed. sidney unjams the door to reveal... mr. prescott, late 40's, a severe presence. a distracted man, nervous and pre occupied.}

<A>__{he gives her a wink and pulls the door closed. billy reappears.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{close call.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<A>__{billy takes a flying leap and lands on the bed.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{it just occurred to me that i've never snuck through your bedroom window.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{now that it's out of your system.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{and i was home, bored, watching television, the exorcist was on and it got me thinking of you.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{oh it did?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{yeah, it was edited for tv. all the good stuff was cut out and i started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "r" rating on our way to an nc17. and how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of...edited for television.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{so you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have little bump bump.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{no, no. i wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule. i just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff.}
<A>__{she snuggles up next to him, planting a kiss on his lips. passionate and gentle. he, however, reacts like a shark, moving on top of her, his hands everywhere as he presses into her...sidney breaks away.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{time to go, stud bucket.}
<A>__{billy sits up. his heart isn't racing...it's pounding.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{see what you do to me.}
<A>__{sweat has popped out all over his forehead, his breathing heavy.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{you know what my dad will do to you?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{i'm going...i'm going.}
<A>__{he moves to the window. she follows, motioning to his wound.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{i appreciate the romantic gesture.}
<A>__{she gives him a kiss goodnight. sweet and simple.}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(whisper)}
<D>__{hey..about the sex stuff. i'm not trying to rush you. i was only half serious.}
<A>__{she kisses him again as he eases through the window.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{would you settle for a pg 13 relationship?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{she pulls her flannel gown open for a split second...flashing her left breast. his mouth drops open...surprise, shock. their eyes meet. they share a smile.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{get outa here.}
