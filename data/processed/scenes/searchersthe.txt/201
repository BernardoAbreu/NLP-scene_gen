<L>__{exterior a mexican village full shot ethan and martin day}
<A>__{it is a small place a single dirt street, a few adobe houses; a few racks of dried meat; a burro with a load of faggots on its back being driven along by a small boy; the music coming from a little cantina in the middle of the street. before the cantina is a bone rack of a horse, without a saddle only a blanket pad. there is something familiar about the horse and ethan is staring at it as they ride in.}
