<L>__{exterior juhu slum. night.}
<A>__{from high up, the rickety tin roof tops of the slum seem to stretch to the horizon. there is a distant shout, a figure waving an arm.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{it's coming!}
<A>__{then another shout and another, a chain of voices coming closer. people come out of their doorways with pails and buckets. the shouts come closer until we see a naked figure entirely encased in bubbles dancing and singing in the lane. jamal is the happiest boy in the slum.}
<C>__{jamal}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{amitabh, amitabh, oh amitabh!}
<C>__{jamal }
<D>__{i have your autograph, oh, holy amitabh!}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{here it comes!}
<A>__{water comes bubbling through a hose and jamal's mother hoses down her ecstatic son.}
