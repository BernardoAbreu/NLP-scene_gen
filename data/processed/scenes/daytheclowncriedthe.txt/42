<L>__{exterior barracks h night}
<A>__{the door to barracks h slowly opens and helmut peeks through the opening to see that all is clear... he slips out and walks along the dark, dreary alleyway towards the guard's shack... he moves like a prisoner trying to miss the spotlights in a jail break...}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{helmut gets to the guards hut... he looks into the window, and sees the guard he wants... sitting at his desk eating off a tray that has a meal fit for a king on it... including the "doilies"... wine, and a steak that would satisfy six men in barracks h... helmut looks around to be sure no one notices him and slowly slips up to the front door of the shack and knocks on the door...}
