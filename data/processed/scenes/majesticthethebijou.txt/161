<L>__{exterior sheriff's station day}
<A>__{pete comes out into the bright midday sun. it takes a moment for his eyes to adjust, and when they do, he becomes aware of perhaps twenty people lining the sidewalk in front of the station. pete's pov we recognize several of the people. carl leffert. bob leffert and mabel lanier. daley thornhill. katie rutherford. stanton lawson. now, there's nothing in the least bit threatening about the gathering and that's what's so disturbing about it. they're not an angry mob, they're just standing there, running the gamut of emotions. shock. disillusionment. betrayal. it's an awkward moment. pete doesn't quite know how to react. he wants to go over and talk to them, but he wouldn't know what to say. he wishes one of them would talk to him, just say something, anything. but no one does. then, bob leffert turns away from pete. he shoves his hook hand into his pocket and sullenly moves away, followed by mabel, then his brother, then the others... ... leaving pete alone.}
