<L>__{interior car same time}
<A>__{as buddy sees flashing lights approach from the opposite direction. he stays cool as the green and whites get closer... closer... then fly right on past.}
<L>__{interior trunk same}
<A>__{as the sirens scream at us for a moment, then fade.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{you're sure easy to talk to. i wonder say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and i came up to you i wonder what would happen.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i mean if you didn't know who i was.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you'd probably tell me.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i'm just saying i think if we met under different circumstances...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you have to be kidding.}
<A>__{silence. foley tries to get back to where it was working...}
<C>__{foley}

<C>__{karen}
<D>__{with robert redford, when he was young.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{yeah...}
<A>__{they lie there a moment, think about that as we hear the car slowing down, coasting, then bumping along the shoulder of the road to a stop.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{really.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i mean, romantically.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{well, but if }
<A>__{the trunk goes dark again as the car's turned off.}
<C>__{buddy }
<D>__{you still alive in there?}
<A>__{and the trunk lid raises so that we see karen and foley lying in the back. foley gets out. karen doesn't move.}
<C>__{foley }
<D>__{where in the hell are we?}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{that's the turnpike up there. glenn's waiting with the other car.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{okay, honey, come on out of there.}
<A>__{karen pushes off, rolls from her right side to her left, brings up her sig sauer in both hands to put it on them, both standing in the opening, in the dark, but right there.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{get your hands up and turn around. now .}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{shit...}
<A>__{foley brings the lid down, he and buddy moving in opposite directions as she begins firing from the inside... as buddy and foley hook up again in front of the car. we can see they're beneath an overpass. foley stares at the trunk.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{we may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{she's coming with us.}
<A>__{foley walks to the passenger seat, reaches in the window.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{jesus christ, what were you doing in there?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{get the shotgun. and her purse. i'd like to know who she is.}
<A>__{foley takes her wallet, looks at her driver's licence photo.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{i already looked. her name is karen sisco. like the cisco kid only spelled different, s i s c o.}
<A>__{a sheriff's green and white goes screaming past and they keep to the narrow space between the car and the concrete abutment of the overpass. when the road quiets down, foley moves to the trunk and bangs on it once with his fist.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{karen? be a good girl now, you hear? now, i'm gonna open the }
<A>__{foley jumps at the sound of a pistol shot.}
<C>__{foley }
<D>__{you're putting holes in your car!}
<A>__{he looks up to see buddy holding her shotgun, staring at him. he settles down, then...}
<C>__{foley }
<D>__{we're not leaving you. i'm gonna open the trunk enough for you to throw the gun out. okay? you shoot buddy's got your shotgun, says he'll shoot back if you do and i can't stop him. so it's up to you.}
<A>__{foley puts his hand out and buddy, still looking at him funny, gives him the keys.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{coming from somewhere above them.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{it's me, glenn.}
<A>__{foley steps out into the open, buddy close behind him. they look up to see a figure, head and shoulders against the evening sky, leaning on the concrete overpass rail. we can see his long blond hair falling beside his face, now half concealed behind dark sunglasses.}
<C>__{glenn}
<D>__{hey, jack, good to see you, man. the fuck're you guys shooting at?}
<A>__{foley looks at buddy.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{do we need him?}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{the green and whites saw us. one of 'em starts thinking, what's that car doing there? ties it to the break and turns around...}
<A>__{foley thinks about it, then looks up at the overpass again.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{oh, hey, studs? we thought you were somebody else.}
<C>__{glenn}
<D>__{studs. man, i haven't heard that since lompoc. what's going on?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{oh, nuthin'.}
<A>__{foley shakes his head, then walks back to the ford and bangs on the trunk.}
<C>__{foley }
<D>__{you coming out?}
<A>__{foley sticks the key in the lock as buddy steps up to the trunk and racks the pump on the shotgun. foley leans close to the metal.}
<C>__{foley }
<D>__{you hear that?}
<A>__{he turns the key and raises the lid. karen, bunched in there, extends her arm, her hand holding the sig sauer by the barrel.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you win, jack.}
<A>__{"jack." buddy gives him another funny look.}
