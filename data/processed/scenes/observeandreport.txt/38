<D>__{look, i'm sure you and your little friend have made a real lifestyle for yourselves here. it's probably easy for you to blind most men with your beauty, but i'm not most men. i can see through the sexuality to the truth. jewelry, gold, diamonds, you don't really expect me to think that a man wants that crap. i'm putting you on my list of top suspects. i don't think you did the crime, but i do think you are an accomplice.}
