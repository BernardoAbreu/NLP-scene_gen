<L>__{exterior prison yard day}
<A>__{a prisoner shirtless, his upper body smeared with white powder, screaming, slams his fist down into face. blood sprays on white. we see that he is beating down a uniformed guard. the guard wears a black gas mask, shattered and pouring blood. other prisoners, shackled together, stand by watching, forming a half circle around the fight. they are shirtless, covered in the same white powder they look like tribesmen. one of the prisoners, very distinctive, nods grimly, clearly enjoying the show.}
<C>__{distinctive prisoner}
<D>__{fuck him up.}
<A>__{the prison yard is a vast expanse of white it could be a chalk mine, or the surface of a strange planet. distant towers mark the perimeter. other groups of shackled prisoners can be seen in the distance, trotting along in lines. trails of thick magenta smoke snake across the yard, sucked by the wind. the rogue prisoner stomps down on the guard's face one last time his shoes are made of cloth. crunch. the guard stops moving. the prisoner starts to run for it across the white terrain. a group of guards appear to round up the remaining prisoners. they club them down with the butts of rifles but pay no mind to the fleeing rogue... they merely watch him go, impassive. in a moment, we see why when the rogue prisoner crosses between the two distant towers he is jerked to the ground by an invisible field. sound? light? magnetism? his body goes into spasms; blood foams from his ears, mouth, eyes.}
