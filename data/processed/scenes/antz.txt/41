<A>__{back at the feast, a cricket strums on his legs like a guitar, opining about life and the universe to a bunch of other chilled out, hippyesque insects...bala taps her feet to the song.}
<C>__{cricket}
<D>__{what if, like...we're just these tiny little things, and we're just like part of this whole other huge universe, that's like, so big we don't even know it exists?}
<C>__{ladybug}
<D>__{man...that's so deep...}
<A>__{at that moment ant team six rapels down from the top of the garbage bin, landing amongst the insects.}
<C>__{mandible}
<D>__{everybody down!}
<A>__{the cricket gets up to confront mandible, but mandible coldcocks him with a right to the jaw. the other insects, too surprised to fight, just do as they're told.}
<C>__{mandible}
<D>__{alright, you hippy scum! make one move and i will exterminate you!}
<A>__{a couple of commandoes grab bala by the arms and heave her up.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{stop! you don't understand!}
<C>__{mandible}
<D>__{i don't have to understand, missy i've got orders. now where's z?}
