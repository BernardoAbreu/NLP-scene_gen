<C>__{joan}
<D>__{there are really only three actions open to a person.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{only three okay. and what are they?}

<D>__{to run, to spectate, to commit.}
<A>__{max peers at her a moment, then around the square.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{has it occurred to you that this obsession with charity is really a flaw in your character?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{charity! it's not charity, dear child, it's love. you're very badly twisted around, aren't you?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{one of us sure as hell is.}
<A>__{the clinic's part time doctor, sunil dasgupta, comes out of the clinic after a very long day.}

<C>__{max}
<D>__{there you go, little guy. ut what's this?}
<A>__{reaching behind shambu's ear, max produces a boiled sweet. aloka watches this with a smile; their eyes touch again... as manooj lets out a cry at the sight of their father.}
