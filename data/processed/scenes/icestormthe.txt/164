<A>__{elena and jim walk outside into the freezing, pelting rain. covering their faces, they jog to his car, an oversized cadillac. a thick glaze of ice forms on his windshield.}
<L>__{interior jim's cadillac. night}
<A>__{they climb in.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{we're going to have to defrost this thing for a while.}
<A>__{he turns on the ignition, and the vents start to blow cold air at them. he leans over and kisses her.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{do these seats go back?}
<A>__{that starts it. he jumps at her, unbuckling her and unzipping himself. they tangle uncomfortably for a few seconds. and then, comically, he's in her. with a groan, it's over in a flash. jim pulls himself off, readjusting his pants.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{that was awful, really awful. i'm so sorry, elena.}
<A>__{elena has somehow worked herself into the cavity of the glove compartment, and is trying to figure out how to extricate herself.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{things are really rotten at home. you wouldn't believe how rotten. janey's sick. she's unstable, i guess... it's not the right time to tell you... but that's it it's like i can't make her happy, the boys can't make her happy, she just doesn't }
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{jim, maybe we should just go. i've got to look in on the kids. paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.}

<D>__{jesus, let me make it up to you i can do better than that, honestly }
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{well, we can talk about it.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{that's fine. i wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{maybe you just need look, can you wait here a sec, i need to tidy up just a minute, i will be right back. you'll wait?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{she opens the door and walks back to the house.}
