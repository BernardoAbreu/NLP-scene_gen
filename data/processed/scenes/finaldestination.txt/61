<B>__{on the counter}
<A>__{tod's hand enter frame. the scissors, sadistically just out of reach. tod's face falls into frame, suspended by the cord, propped against the back wall of the shower stall, his bluish purple tongue grotesquely juts from his mouth. tod's pov death all four edges of frame appear to collapse as if by weight of the darkness until forming a myopic center. then, from within the center... appears tod's face. although the expression is serene the pallor is grayish, until... suddnely, shockingly... tod's face decays, as if ten years of rot in the grave is compressed into 72 frames.}

<A>__{as his body settles... dies... camera pulls away fully revealing his lifeless form. once behind the toilet tank, camera cranes down to the floor. the water eerily retreats from the floor, slipping back toward the base of the toilet and like a murderer, slips out of the night.}
