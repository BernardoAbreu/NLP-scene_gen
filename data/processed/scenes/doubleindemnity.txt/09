<A>__{they have now reached the door. neff opens it. phyllis stands in the doorway, her lips white.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{straight down the line.}
<A>__{she goes quietly. he watches her down the corridor. slowly he closes the door and goes back into the room. he moves across the window and opens it wide. he stands there, looking down into the dark street. from below comes the sound of a car starting and driving off. the rain drifts in against his face. he just stands there motionless. his mind is going a hundred miles a minute.}
