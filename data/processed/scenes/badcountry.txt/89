<L>__{interior lucian adams' office day}
<A>__{close on: a snifter as louis xiii pours to the rim. from elsewhere in the room:}
<C>__{male voice}
<D>__{this operation of your's has become big business. you need relationships now more than ever...}
<A>__{the voice belongs to richard morris, 40s. he sits in a leather chair, facing lucian adams, who's face we cannot see. seated next to morris, is daniel kiersey.}
<C>__{morris}
<D>__{...we've done business successfully before, mr. adams. but it's a larger scope now. i'm here today because i want to represent you exclusively. you need someone lobbying at a state level, as well as in washington. my organization can provide both. we've got contacts that you don't have and other people can't get. now, i'm aware that you have multiple businesses... however you need one go to guy, so that all your ventures stay coordinated and all transactions and contracts are realized. i am that person, mr. adams. that's what i do.}
<A>__{lucian's hand lifts the cognac out of frame, drinks.}
<C>__{kiersey}
<D>__{what's this going to cost us?}
<C>__{morris}
<D>__{as a retainer, i want an advance of three hundred fifty thousand, along with ten percent of whatever economic benefit i bring to this organization.}
<C>__{kiersey}
<D>__{three fifty? c'mon, dick. that's out of line.}
<C>__{morris}
<D>__{if you want a quality global economic plan, that's what you pay for }
<C>__{lucian o.s.}
<D>__{we'll give you two, mr. morris...that's what it's worth.}
<A>__{morris goes suddenly silent, looks across at lucian.}
<C>__{lucian o.s.}
<D>__{the advance is a drop in the bucket. the real money is the percentage. it's in your interest to see it my way.}
<A>__{morris stares across the desk, several tense moments. then:}
<C>__{morris}
<D>__{you've got a deal.}
