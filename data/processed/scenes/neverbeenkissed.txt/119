<L>__{interior science classroom day}
<A>__{on the walls are safe sex posters. on the front desk, pamphlets on sexually transmitted diseases share space with plastic biology cross section models of male and female reproductive organs. sam stands in front of his english class, impatiently looking at his watch. josie looks up from her desk, sees anita waving wildly from the other side of the glass door. josie's eyes widen, she starts to make "get out of here" movements. sam notices josie and follows her gaze to anita. he opens the door, speaks sotto to anita.}
