<L>__{exterior woods day}
<A>__{deckard walking over the snow. alone. he walks slowly, mechanically through the cold, unaffected by it. his gaunt face, empty of expression except for the tears running down his pale cheeks. but for the squeak of his wet shoes over the crusted snow, there is no sound. and deckard recedes into the silence of the freezing white landscape.}
<L>__{exterior highway night}
<A>__{deckard's car, solid, throbbing, gunning along like some metal animal. headlights piercing the dark of the long, flat road. whistling speed of air and tires spin ning thrum. and then silence. and the silence astounded by the crack of a gun.}
