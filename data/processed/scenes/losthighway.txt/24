<A>__{renee opens the manila envelope. she's noticeably nervous when she sees a videotape inside. she stares at it. fred enters, also wearing a bathrobe. he sees renee staring at the videotape before she hears him enter. when she does hear him, her eyes jerk away from the tape.}

<D>__{come on.}
<A>__{they sit on the couch in front of the television. the tv monitor: we begin on the tv, then the videotape fills the entire frame. the videotape shows the front of the madison house, the camera panning slowly over it. the picture is accompanied by an eerie droning sound. after the camera pans back to the front door, the tape image turns to snow. fred and renee stare at the snow for a few moments. renee looks relieved.}
