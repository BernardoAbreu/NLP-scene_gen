<P>__{(finishing a joke)}
<D>__{ and the wife says yeah, harry, i know, but this one's eating my popcorn!}
<A>__{he busts out laughing. edwards, across from him, is completely disoriented. he looks down. there's a half eaten order of broccoli beef and several empty bottles of beer on the table in front of him.}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{huh?}

<D>__{another beer?}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{coffee. please.}
<A>__{she walks off. edwards looks at the table. there is a business card lying next to his plate, on which kay has handwritten "james d. edwards, saturday, 9 a.m., 504 battery drive." edwards looks at it, puzzled. he turns the card over and looks at the other side. there's not much there, no name, no phone or fax number, no e mail address. just three little letters, dead in the middle of the card:}
