<A>__{ryan and natalie enter, still having the same conversation.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{how about just not dying alone?}
<A>__{ryan stops to address this.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{starting when i was twelve, we moved each one of my grandparents into a nursing facility. my parents went the same way.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{make no mistake. we all die alone.}
<A>__{ryan turns, thinks of something, then turns back.}
<C>__{ryan }
<P>__{(adding)}
<D>__{those cult members down in san diego with the white sneakers and little dixie cups of kool aid. they didn't die alone.}
<A>__{natalie looks steamed.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{just saying there's options.}
<A>__{out of nowhere, natalie starts crying.}
<C>__{ryan}
<P>__{(almost silent)}
<D>__{oh fuck.}
<A>__{natalie is now balling in the middle of the lobby.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{brian left me.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{oh, hey... i...}
<A>__{ryan goes to hug natalie and she simply folds into his arms a mop of tears. ryan looks around for a place to set her down. instead, he finds... alex who gives a questioning look to the young sobbing girl.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{hi. alex this is natalie. natalie, this is my... friend, alex.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i should give you both a moment.}
<A>__{natalie attempts a recovery. it's not graceful.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{no, it's fine. i'm fine. just stupid emotions.}
<A>__{natalie gives alex a firm handshake.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{maybe a drink?}
<A>__{ryan goes to challenge the idea, when...}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{now we're talking.}
