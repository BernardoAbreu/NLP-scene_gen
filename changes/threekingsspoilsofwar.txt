He scrambles to load a grenade in his launcher as the gunship comes about.  It races for him, cannons at the ready.  This one is going to be close.  Epps locks and loads just as the chopter swings down on him.  Epps fires, but the gunship simply jukes up and away from the grenade the way someone might step over a bug.  The grenade impacts the rock face behind the chopter exploding harmlessly.  The chopter returns the favor by reining down a hail of shells that kicks Epps back FLIPPING HIM UP AND OVER the edge of the plateau.  His M-16 goes flying, smashing into the ground far below.

One of the Iraqis starts to yell something.  He lifts his weapon and aims it at our boys.  With his thumb Epps yanks the pin from the grenade and lets fly.  It's a perfect toss, landing in the chopter's bay.  The Iraqis see the grenade land, they scramble for it.  One of them grabs it up and is about to throw it back out of the gunship. Too late.

The bullets fly fast and furious swarming all around our boys. Epps whips the horse, trying to get everything she's got to give.  This is it:  They get away now, or not at all.  Their horse finds a little something extra.  She goes faster, faster... Suddenly Epps pulls up hard on the reins.  The horse rears up, she goes wild.  It takes everything Epps has to control her.  But better that than if she'd taken another stride. They've come to the edge of a very, very sharp cliff.  Epps may be a good rider for a novice, but no way he could get this beast to fly.
