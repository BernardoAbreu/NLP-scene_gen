<L>__{exterior team clifford building day}
<A>__{police cars line the driveway outside the beach front building site. officers cordon off the road as forensics teams photograph every inch of the building... standing amidst the crowd of onlookers is an irate mr. barajas, accompanied, as ever, by cicatriz. they are both on cellphones, both talking angry, fast spanish.}
<L>__{interior team clifford building night}
<A>__{plastic sheeting covers the windowless top floor of the unfinished condos. the white suited forensics team work meticulously, led by the tireless dr. chad borman, delicately dusting anything and everything that might yield evidence... morrison stands at the edge of an area cordoned off by police tape. he's looking at jay's smashed digital video camera, now bagged and tagged as evidence...}
<C>__{kristen }
<D>__{sexual predators often keep a trophy...}
<A>__{morrison spins, sees kristen. he stumbles with his words, not used to talking to beautiful women...}
<C>__{morrison}
<D>__{i'm sorry?}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{maybe he recorded the rape.}
<A>__{morrison looks at the remains of the camera.}
<C>__{morrison}
<D>__{and maybe he didn't. we'll never know. tape's mangled. forensics said it'd take months to fix it.}
<A>__{he looks up into kristen's hypnotic eyes.}
<C>__{morrison}
<D>__{we were never properly introduced. michael morrison.}
<A>__{she offers her hand, and morrison shakes it.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{miss richards. kristen. miami parole. was just in town for a couple days checking in on some parolees when all this went down...}
<A>__{she hands morrison a business card, which he absently stuffs into his pocket...}
<C>__{morrison}
<D>__{you think maybe you could lean on the girl? get her to drop this nonsense? we all know she's lying. with all this black widow shit going down, we just don't have the time or manpower to...}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{she might not be lying, you know.}
<C>__{morrison}
<D>__{what makes you think that?}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{just a look in her eye. i...i have some experience...}
<A>__{morrison doesn't want to push her further... all of a sudden the sunlight is blocked from the massive unfinished floor by black sheets erected by the forensics team, leaving everyone in pitch darkness....}
<C>__{morrison}
<D>__{what the hell?}
<A>__{slowly an eerie ultra violet glow fills the room. the white suited forensics technicians, glowing under the black light, wait patiently for evidence to show itself... suddenly the clear imprints of hands on the wall become clear, along with the black stains of blood flecks...}
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{gotcha...}
<C>__{morrison}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{blood, fingerprints, sign of a struggle. i'd say we've got a rape on our hands, detective, but we won't know for sure until we run the tests...}
<A>__{morrison's head is spinning...}
<C>__{morrison}
<D>__{fine. just do it...}
