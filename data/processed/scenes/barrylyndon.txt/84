<L>__{interior chevalier's apartments night}
<A>__{the chevalier is at play against several gentlemen, including the prince of turbingen, while roderick signals the cards.}
<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{it was agreed that i should keep my character of valet, that in the presence of strangers i should not know a word of english, that i should keep good lookout on the trumps when i was serving the champagne and punch about; and, having a remarkably fine eyesight, and a great natural aptitude, i was speedily able to give my dear benefactor much assistance against his opponents at the green table.}
<A>__{several cuts of playing and cheating to illustrate voice over.}
<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{simplicity was our secret. everything successful is simple. if, for instance, i wiped the dust off a chair with my napkin, it was to show that the enemy was strong in diamonds; if i pushed it, he had an ace, king; if i said, "punch or wine, my lord?" hearts was meant. if "wine or punch?" clubs. if i blew my nose, it was to indicate that there was another confederate employed by the adversary; and then, i warrant you, some pretty trials of skill would take place. the prince of turbingen, although so young, had a very great skill and cleverness with the cards in every way; and it was only from hearing ritter von brandenburg, who came with him, yawn three times when the chevalier had the ace of trumps, that i knew we were greek to greek, as it were.}
<A>__{the prince loses a big hand, and, in a fury, throws down his cards. he stares at the table, then at the chevalier.}
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{chevalier, though i cannot say how, i believe you have cheated me.}
<C>__{chevalier}
<D>__{i deny your grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?}
<C>__{prince}
<P>__{(glaring at roderick)}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{chevalier}
<D>__{your grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which i have honorably won.}
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. if you will be patient, maybe i will pay you something another time.}
<C>__{chevalier}
<D>__{your grace, if i am so tame as to take this, then i must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.}
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{i have said all there is to be said. i am at your disposal for whatever purposes you wish. good night.}
<A>__{he exits.}
