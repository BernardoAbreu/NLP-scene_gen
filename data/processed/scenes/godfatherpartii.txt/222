<L>__{exterior the impressive estate of don francesco day}
<A>__{we see an old car approach. its driver is the young tomasino. sitting in the car with him is vito. the car stops at the gates, and an old guard sees and recognizes tomasino, opens the gates allowing them to enter.}
<B>__{med. view}
<A>__{on an almost decrepit don francesco. he must be in his early nineties, sitting as powerful and as impressive as ever, in his throne like chair from which he manages the power as the mafia chieftan of this village. young don tomasino is speaking. we notice in a little distance in the rear, there are some younger shepherds with shotguns thrown over their shoulders.}
<C>__{tomasino}
<P>__{(sicilian)}
<D>__{don francesco, if you will honor me, by allowing me to introduce my associate in america, in new york. his name is vito corleone.}
<A>__{the old man and his eyes glance up at a notion of a man who has taken the name of this town as his name.}
<C>__{tomasino}
<D>__{we will supply him with olive oil exclusively in the town of corleone. his company is called the "genco olive oil company." here we have brought you an indication of how he will sell the product.}
<A>__{tomasino respectfully puts a can of olive oil where the old man can look at it. the old man nods, accepting the notion of this business.}
<C>__{tomasino}
<P>__{(sicilian)}
<D>__{we have come to ask your blessing and permission to continue this enterprise.}
<C>__{don francesco}
<P>__{(sicilian) (in a shrill, high, raspy voice)}
<D>__{where is this young man?}
<C>__{tomasino}
<D>__{he is right here, standing next to me, don francesco.}
<C>__{don francesco}
<P>__{(sicilian)}
<D>__{have him come closer, i can't see very well.}
<A>__{vito takes those several steps, so that he is standing right in front of the old man.}
<B>__{view on don francesco}
<A>__{looking up, squinting against the sun. don francesco's view strangely backlit, almost blurry image of the young man from america.}
<C>__{don francesco}
<P>__{(sicilian)}
<D>__{what is your name?}
<C>__{vito}
<P>__{(sicilian)}
<D>__{vito corleone.}
<C>__{don francesco}
<P>__{(sicilian)}
<D>__{you took the name of this town, eh? what was your father's name?}
<C>__{vito}
<P>__{(sicilian)}
<D>__{antonio andolini.}
<B>__{close view on the old man}
<A>__{the recognition of the name throws a shudder through him. it is as though he recognizes that this is the boy; the son of his old enemy, whom he had killed, and whose sons he had tried to wipe out. the old man raises his feeble hands signalling his guard, and in his weak voice, he shouts:}
<C>__{don francesco}
<P>__{(sicilian)}
<D>__{kill him! kill him!}
<A>__{but he is too late; vito steps forward.}
<C>__{vito}
<P>__{(sicilian)}
<D>__{in the name of my father, and my brother...}
<A>__{and uses the knife, ritualistically plunging it into the old man's belly, and then up to his throat, which is severed.}
<B>__{view on tomasino}
<A>__{has drawn his pistol and quickly shoots one of the guards, helping vito to escape back into the motor car.}
<B>__{view on a guard}
<A>__{raising his shotgun.}
<B>__{view on the motor car}
<A>__{just as tomasino is about to get into the car, the shotgun is fired, and he is hit in the legs. vito manages to pull him up into the car, and they make their escape.}
