<A>__{in the morgue, laurel is working at a desk when suddenly rosenberg's cat leaps up onto it from nowhere, the way cats do, landing right in the middle of the file she's studying. laurel jumps.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{boy, when you want attention }
<A>__{she pets the cat. as she does, the cat's collar shines in the light. laurel turns the name tag to face her. close on a precious jewel, and the word "orion." as it is written across the collar of the cat.}
<C>__{laurel }
<D>__{"orion." that's a pretty name.}
<A>__{from out in the corridor, a bell rings ding, ding. laurel notices something dangling from the cat's collar a circular icon of a strange and beautiful metal. the center is some sort of hardened, translucent material, light green in color.}
<C>__{laurel }
<D>__{what's this?}
<A>__{she peers into the jewel, and her face washes over with amazement.}
