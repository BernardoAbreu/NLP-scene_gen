<L>__{interior old van near maggie's}
<A>__{ray, still in his field clothes sits, training binoculars on the distant house. he opens a carton of milk, drinks some. then hears a whimpering. in the passenger seat sits the three legged res dog. ray has taken him with him. he drinks some milk, then opens the carton up fully and sticks it out so the dog can lap it up. ray laughs in disbelief, shaking his head.}

<D>__{for all i know, you're jimmy. and you're just waiting for a shot at my jugular. drink, jimmy. milk is good for you }
<A>__{the dog is lapping the milk, desperately. and then a roaring. a motorcycle. in the side mirror: crow horse, racing up on the left of the van. ray pulls his hat down low, and sits back. the motorcycle passes on the left, slowing enough so that crow horse can flip ray the middle finger. then he races on, far down the road. ray sits there, shaking his head. he'll let it go. bullshit. he starts the car.}
