<A>__{the cat is strolling around as roby and melkonis drop into seats; standard draws a cup of coffee from the machine.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{these day and night cycles are totally disorienting. i feel like we've been here for days, but it's only been how long?}
<C>__{roby}
<P>__{(stroking the cat)}
<D>__{about four hours.}
<C>__{standard}
<P>__{(staring into his coffee cup)}
<D>__{i'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place, martin. we never should have landed here.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{look, i'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything. the important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{i can't lean on faust any harder he's been working non stop on the engines.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{if we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship }
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{we do know that.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{they never made it off the planet. the parasites won.}
<A>__{this brings a chilly silence.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{where did the parasites come from?}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{they seem native to the planet. it's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity. it's dead now, but once it must have been fertile.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{no. it's just too small to support fauna as big as the parasites. if there were a native ecology, it would have to be microscopic.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{couldn't the pyramid have been built here by space travellers?}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{too primitive. it's a pre technological construction. that slab was engineered by an iron age culture at best.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{they're from a dead civilization; they're spores from a tomb. god knows how long they've been here.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{i think we better take another look at those heiroglyphs.}
<A>__{suddenly the door opens and faust sticks his head in. he is covered with dirt and grime.}
<C>__{faust}
<D>__{hey, guess what?}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{faust}
<D>__{the engines are fixed.}
