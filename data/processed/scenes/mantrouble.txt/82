<A>__{harry searches through the file cabinet then moves over to the desk and as joan had done previously, goes through the drawers. duke sits in the doorway, watching him.}

<A>__{duke follows harry's every movement, as he engages in a deft, professional search of the bedroom. he goes through the bureau drawers, the closet shelves, a pair of suitcases, then crosses to one of the two nightstands. finding nothing in the drawer, he moves around to its mate on the other side of the bed.}
<B>__{close on harry}
<A>__{he opens the drawer, glances inside and starts to close it when he sees:}
<B>__{pov of drawer}
<A>__{a gift envelope with his name on it rests on a small wrapped box. he picks it up, opens the envelope and takes out a plain white card with a handwritten message on it:}
<B>__{close on card}
<A>__{"thank you for everything you've done for me, harry, and mostly, for being in my life. i love you, joan."}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{harry sits down on the bed, feeling the utter deficiency of heart implicit in this act of treachery and deception. he stares blankly into space for a moment. then he puts the card back, picks up the box and without removing it from the drawer, gives it a little shake.}
