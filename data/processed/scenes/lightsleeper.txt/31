<D>__{that it'd be like this like, your life, you... that it would turn out this way? }
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{compared to what? my thinking this or that is going to make any difference? there's a plan unfolding. "will my plane crash?" "does life have meaning?" why ask me? thinking's a fear of living, negative living; living's something else. you're afraid. let the plan unfold. stop. stop, live one day one day }
