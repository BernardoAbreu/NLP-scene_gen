<L>__{exterior small building in back street day}
<A>__{a brick slides out of the wall. we're behind the brick and see gangooly's soft face as he reaches in and pulls out a key. the street is small and empty. though the houses are nothing much, to the pals, they look like palaces. manooj and shambu run about in delight. gangooly motions for quiet. with a flourish, he opens the door.}
<L>__{interior small room day}
<A>__{gangooly enters, glances around, waves the pals in. they're amazed. there's a cage occupied by two parrots. in one corner, a small altar dedicated to the goddess lakshmi is decorated with some flowers and, behind a torn, plastic curtain in a corner, part kitchen, part wash place, containing a tap with running water.}
<C>__{gangooly}
<D>__{be free look around.}
<A>__{on the faces of the family is one thought: is it possible? amrita goes right to the parrots.}
<C>__{gangooly}
<D>__{they'll need feeding. give them seed. but don't spoil them.}
<A>__{he bows briefly before the altar as he moves to the washing area.}
<C>__{gangooly}
<D>__{and now, one of the miracles of life in the city. one and two...}
<A>__{he turns on the tap and a stream of brown water gurgles out. the pals are hypnotized, the fists around their hearts begin to ease.}
<C>__{gangooly}
<D>__{holy water from the ganges! flows out forever. come touch it.}
<A>__{manooj and shambu put their hands under the tap.}
<C>__{gangooly}
<D>__{drink! it's as pure as the dew on shiva's lips.}
<A>__{they drink. gangooly claps in delight... and beckons hasari aside.}
<B>__{favoring gangooly and hasari}
<C>__{gangooly}
<D>__{now, this place is yours for two weeks. my cousin, moti, is away, traveling. normally, the rent takes fifty rupees for a week, but for a brother, forty. no, don't thank me.}
<A>__{hasari pulls out his little screw of money.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{i have only seventy five, but as soon as i have work...}
<C>__{gangooly}
<D>__{give me the fifty, pay the rest next week. you'll find work, i trust you. aren't i from bihar, too? yes.}
<A>__{and the money is in his hand. he joins his hands together.}
<C>__{gangooly}
<D>__{you are pleased? then mr. gangooly is pleased. it's how i am.}
<A>__{he turns on his heel and he's gone. for a moment, the pals are still, swept from the brink of catastrophe to salvation... and now, as one, they release their sheer and utter joy.}
