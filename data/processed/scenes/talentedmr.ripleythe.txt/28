<L>__{interior jazz club, naples. night.}
<A>__{a cavern blue with smoke. a surprisingly good quintet blast out their version of moanin' . dickie and ripley arrive and make their way to a table where fausto is sitting with friends. it's too noisy for conversation, but dickie shouts introductions and they shake ripley's hand. dickie is instantly absorbed in the music, ripley absorbed in dickie. an attractive italian girl, dahlia, comes over, kisses dickie, pulls off his hat, puts it on, there's no room for her to sit, so she sits on dickie's lap, smoking his cigarette. dickie raises his eyebrow at tom, but it's clearly no hardship. then the band strikes up the intro to tu vuo' fa' l'americano a hit which reflects the current craze for all things american and fausto pulls a protesting dickie up onto the stage.}

<D>__{and a big round of applause for a new friend from new york tom ripley!}
<A>__{ripley's mortified, but dickie jumps off the stage and pulls him up. the song continues and now, at the chorus, it's dickie and ripley who have to sing. ripley, of course, can sing well, if not confident in this arena. soon the audience is clapping, standing on tables, dancing, dahlia prominent.}
