<L>__{interior girls' locker room later}
<A>__{josie, post shower, is wrapped in a towel and carrying her sweaty gym clothes. a group of girls walk by her, giggling as they exit. she approaches her locker and finds it ajar and completely empty. she looks from the empty locker down to the sweaty clothes in her hand. a realization sweeps over her face.}
<L>__{interior high school hallway later}
<A>__{josie shuffles down the hall, still wearing her cheesy green and yellow gym clothes. she is clearly beaten. she looks down the hall, stunned. it is ridiculous rob is being followed by a posse, everyone knows his name. girls tug on his shirt, guys slap him on the back or high five him.}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{hey, rob.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{robster, what's up?}

<A>__{josie sees guy approach rob, and shake his hand.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{hey robo how's it going?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{nice pants, man. they are rufus.}
<A>__{guy smiles. josie looks like she's going to hurl. she looks down the hall the other way where a huge banner hangs that reads: "impeach sydney anakowski. elect rob student body president.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{hey rob, see you at the carnival later?}
<C>__{stoner 1}
<D>__{it's robilicious!}
<A>__{josie looks on the wall next to her and sees a list: "final cast list for hamlet. hamlet . . . rob."}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{oh, please.}
<A>__{josie has seen enough, and walks on.}
