<L>__{ext interior nightclub evening}
<A>__{a disembodied gaggle of jersey clad shoulders, jeans, and hats crosses a narrow street. lights flare, hands are stamped, torsos are patted down. money exchanges hands. we descend into a black, throbbing tunnel. explicit music booms from bassy club speakers. hips, legs feet dancing. a go go dancer struts and wiggles around a brass pole. hoots and cheers. the dancer marches in place, rolling her thonged bottom. more cheers, greedy hands stuff dollars into her waistband.}
<C>__{female dj }
<D>__{let's go! where all my sexy sagittarian ladies at?}
<A>__{arms go up. a collection of whoops ripple the crowd. the dancer wraps her legs around the pole and oozes upward headfirst. the camera rotates as she stretches her booted heels into the crowd. we realize that she has been dancing on the ceiling.}
<C>__{female dj }
<D>__{oh my god!}
<A>__{alike (pronounced ah lee kay), 17, covers her mouth, laughing and wide eyed. she tries to back away from the stage, but is pushed forward by a torrent of eager arms waving dollar bills. among them is laura, 18, worldly and smooth.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{where your singles at?!! where your singles at?!! yeah, baby!}
<A>__{laura strains over alike's shoulder to tuck a bill into the dancer's boot. alike drops her beer in all the jostling.}
<C>__{female dj}
<D>__{goddamn i love my job!}
<A>__{laura stuffs a bill into alike's now empty hand and forcibly waves alike's wrist in the air. alike pulls free just as the dancer takes notice and begins to direct her attention at her.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{stop! chill!!}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{whatchu' come here for?!}
<A>__{alike shoves the dollar bill into laura's chest and shoulders her way past the wall of onlookers surrounding the stage. laura shrugs, puts the bill in her teeth and lays her head at the edge of the stage. alike looks away and breaks through a snarl of clubgoers just as the dancer begins to descend.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{excuse me. sorry. excuse me. oof, sorry ladies.}
<A>__{finally free of the throng, alike takes a breath and looks at the clock on her cell phone.}
<C>__{alike }
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{she rolls her eyes back to the stage where laura is no longer visible. not daring to risk another plunge into the throbbing crowd, she retreats for the bar.}
<C>__{female dj}
<D>__{let's go!}
<L>__{interior nightclub bar night}
<A>__{alike beaches at an empty spot at the bar. her gaze settles on a cute girl a little ways down, staring out at the dance floor. alike jerks her eyes away and smooths the front of her shirt and adjusts her hat as she edges toward the girl.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{the girl ignores her. alike clears her throat and speaks a little too loudly.}
<C>__{alike }
<D>__{umm... hey! how are you?!}
<A>__{the girl jerks around and frowns at alike, looking her up and down.}
<C>__{cute girl}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{umm...sorry. i was just sayin' umm...hi.}
<C>__{cute girl}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{the girl dismisses alike and turns back toward the floor.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{oh. you wanna drink or something? hey! hey! over here!}
<A>__{alike strains, snapping at the bartender. a confident woman swaggers up close to the girl and extends her hand. the cute girl takes it and allows herself to be lead to the dance floor. alike looks around just in time to see her leaving. the bartender finally materializes, and alike slinks away.}
<L>__{interior nightclub bathroom night}
<A>__{alike slumps into a long line of women waiting to squeeze the cramped, 2 stall bathroom. a couple in front of her makes out vigorously, and she folds her arms and looks away. a buff 30 something woman with locs smiles and winks at alike. alike smiles and fidgets with her eyebrows and looks away. the line inches forward. alike glances around searching for the woman. the 30 something has already lost interest, her attention now fully directed at a much more feminine woman strutting out of the restroom. embarrassed, alike faces front again. two androgynous gangsters (ags) who have witnessed the whole thing nudge each other and sneer. alike squares her shoulders and widens her stance. one of the ag's breaks out in laughter and they turn around as the line inches forward again. alike pretends not to notice and slumps out of line and retreats for a lonely oasis of couch along the wall.}

<A>__{alike dozes on the couch.}
<C>__{female dj}
<D>__{give it up for sin a min ladies!!}

<D>__{lemme dance with shortie first, then i will be ready.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{laura spins the short haired on the dance floor and the pair continue their wobbling, uneven groove. alike endures several moments of invisibility as a sea of women, both "feminine" and "butch" push past her without a second glance. alike tugs at laura's jersey. laura, happily tangled in her dance partner's embrace rolls her eyes.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{stop pulling on my clothes!}

<C>__{alike}
<D>__{oh shit!! yeah, you got me with that one.}
<L>__{interior bus night}
<A>__{alike becomes more quiet and less playful as the ride wears on. a middle class bronx landscape, well lit with a newly constructed starbucks and renovated condos flits by the window. alike reaches over and presses the tape. laura elbows alike.}

<C>__{laura}
<D>__{you got a problem. call me.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{i'ma call you.}
<A>__{alike turns and watches laura stroll away. laura drums a little beat on alike's window as the bus pulls off. alike waves and faces forward again. an old lady sitting nearby shoots her a disapproving look. alike rolls her eyes and moves to a seat farther away.}
<L>__{interior bus continuous}
<A>__{alike studies her reflection in the window, and takes a breath. she unbuttons her bulky men's shirt to reveal a fitting baby doll shirt that reads "princess." she stuffs her baseball cap and durag into her backpack and jabs a pair of small gold hoop earrings into her ears. she slumps back against the seat and stares into the night. the bus stops at a lonely island of curb. alike is a dark silhouette sprinting around the corner and into the night.}
<L>__{interior alike's apartment night}
<A>__{alike cracks open the front door just wide enough to slip through. the house is dark except for the flashing microwave clock. alike takes off her sneakers and pads down the hallway. her younger sister, sharonda's door cracks open as she passes.}

<L>__{interior alike's bedroom night}

<D>__{compliments your figure. i saw something just like it on sale, maybe we could go shopping }
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{goodnight.}
<A>__{audrey stiffens and pulls her robe tighter. vinegar replaces honey in her demeanor as the warmth drains out of her voice.}

<D>__{i really don't care for that young lady you run around with anyway.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{yeah, okay!}
<C>__{audrey}

<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{watch your tone.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{well, it's your skin.}
<A>__{audrey leaves. alike is still. she listens for the door to her parent's room to shut before snatching off the scarf and storming to the bathroom.}
<L>__{interior bathroom night}
<A>__{alike turns on the faucet, wets the soap and puts it back in the dish, wets her wash cloth and puts it back on the rack. she plops down on the toilet and looks up. a crucifix frowns down at her from the wall. she averts her eyes and stands to leave.}
<C>__{audrey }
<D>__{did you brush your teeth?}
<A>__{alike wets her toothbrush and throws it back into the holder.}
<C>__{audrey }
<D>__{lee?}
<A>__{alike squeezes out a dollop of toothpaste and smears a little around the sink. she stares at her reflection.}

<C>__{alike}
<D>__{yes, mom.}
<L>__{exterior school morning}
<A>__{alike, bundled in an oversized hoodie edges up to the perimeter of campus and waits against a bus shelter. students horseplay and mill about the entrance in groups, chugging their morning fantas and munching on snack cakes. the school bell rings and the lawn slowly empties into the building. alike shifts her weight and checks her watch as the last stragglers finally trickle in. she yanks her hoodie tighter and launches across the lawn and into the building.}
<L>__{interior school hallway morning}
<A>__{a second school bell sounds and the din of slamming lockers and jubilant chatter dies to a hush as students shuffle into classrooms. alike cracks the back stairwell door and peeks out into the mostly empty hallway before tearing for the bathroom. one last straggler bina, a 17 year old girl with mature, but down to earth good looks rushes past alike. the two exchange a brief, confused look then mutually dismiss each other as they hurry in opposite directions.}
<L>__{interior school bathroom morning}
<A>__{alike hurtles into the handicapped stall and snaps it shut behind her. she rips off her hoodie and the "girly" shirt beneath and flings them to the floor. she pulls out a pair of wife beaters from her bag and pulls them over her head. she unwads a polo shirt and yanks it over her head. she stares at her reflection in the window and tries unsuccessfully to smooth her shirt. her eyes scour her reflection again and again for any imperfections. she spots the earrings and yanks them out of her ears. the late bell beckons and alike stuffs her "feminine" clothes into her backpack and bolts.}
<L>__{interior math classroom day}
<A>__{the math teacher glides up and down the aisles passing out graded tests. a chorus of groans follows in her wake.}
<C>__{math teacher}
<D>__{as promised, i will be grading these on a curve.}
<A>__{alike is folded into the backmost corner of the classroom. the desks in front her and beside her are empty. she is ignored as the rest of the class chatters and passes notes.}
<C>__{math teacher }
<D>__{but the highest grade on the test was a 98.}
<A>__{the math teacher puts alike's test on her desk and gives her a little smile. alike doesn't smile back. the lunch bell rings and the class is a tornado, clearing the room in a rush of limbs, shouts, and backpacks. alike jabs her headphones into her ears and packs her bag very deliberately, letting the eye of the storm pass over her before heading toward the door.}
<L>__{interior school cafeteria day}
<A>__{the cafeteria is a whirl of activity and social jockeying. clusters of girls and boys loud talk, flirt, fight and horseplay at tables and in tight little groups against the walls. alike walks alone, staying at the fringes of the crowd and shrugs through the cafeteria line.}
<L>__{interior school hallway day}
<A>__{alike flees the cafeteria, tray laden with rubbery cuisine of dubious nutritional value. she raps on the door of a classroom and slips in.}

<L>__{interior ap english classroom day}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{mrs. alvarado, a middle aged californian ex hippie type reclines with her feet on her desk, munching on celery sticks and sunflower seed paste. her small desk radio plays alternative rock. sun beams into the empty classroom and alike squints as she yanks the headphones out of her ears and pulls up a chair next to her desk.}
<C>__{mrs. alvarado}
<D>__{whaddja bring me?}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{nothin' you can eat.}

<A>__{mrs. alvarado flips to the back of the book and her mouth moves silently as she reads.}
<C>__{alike }
<D>__{i will probably do it in class.}
<A>__{mrs. alvarado hands the book back to alike and digs in to another celery stick.}
<C>__{alike}

<D>__{so what?}

<D>__{what do you think?}

<C>__{mrs. alvarado}
<D>__{they're lovely. of course your descriptiveness and use of alliteration is beautiful and all, you know that. but...i don't know. is it your best? no.}

<C>__{alike}
<D>__{i thought it was good.}
<C>__{mrs. alvarado}
<D>__{it's good. not great.}

<D>__{i believe you can go deeper.}
<L>__{interior hospital corridor afternoon}
<A>__{audrey is a heat seeking missile, whipping through the sparse hallways of the trauma wing, her clipboard and pen in constant motion. nurses and aides scatter in her wake, suddenly busying themselves with little bits of chore work to avoid her caustic gaze. she barks at a cluster of clerks chit chatting in the elevator bank and all but one manage to escape. audrey drills her.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{oh, so your log is all up to date?}

<L>__{interior hospital break room continuous}
<A>__{audrey whisks her lunch bag out of the fridge and heads toward a table. a few lounging aides wad up their garbage and flee the break room. audrey settles down at the table and pulls a fashion magazine from her work tote, pretending not to be hurt. she peels open a cup of vanilla yogurt and begins reading. a big red department store bag sits next to her work tote. the television suspended over the table mumbles corporate healthcare infomercials. mrs. singletary, one of audrey's co workers swoops in and plops a plastic grocery bag on the table across from her.}
<C>__{mrs. singletary}
<D>__{hey girl! mind if i sit here?}

<D>__{oh i'm...i don't know where my mind is...yeah, this is just uh well let me get your opinion.}

<L>__{exterior laura's rooftop weeks later}
<A>__{alike and laura sit at the edge of the roof sharing a quart of mint chocolate chip ice cream. sunset paints the cityscape pink and orange. the faint cadence of children playing drifts in and out on a fickle breeze. alike's wounds are healing and she seems happy. the friends exchange wordless smiles and soak in the peacefulness around them. laura hears a noise at the door and gets up to investigate. arthur is standing in the doorway. laura calls out to alike. alike looks up and the smile fades from her face. arthur tries to move around laura, but laura stares him down. laura looks back at alike. alike considers, then carefully nods. laura steps out of the way and watches arthur pass. alike rises to face her father. she stands tall, her weight is centered. arthur struggles to find her eyes, and she turns away from him. distant playground voices fill the pause.}

<A>__{alike sits at the edge of the roof writing in her notebook. laura swings open the door and alike looks back in greeting, her smile fading as arthur appears behind her. laura motions to alike. alike considers, then carefully nods. laura steps aside and watches arthur pass. alike wanders to the edge of the roof, arthur follows. distant playground voices fill the pause.}

<A>__{alike makes no sign.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{you couldnt've been more than 2 years old. and when the wind would blow, all those leaves would come rushing down the street at us and you thought they were alive. you'd get so scared. you'd cry and you'd scream and beg for us to pick you up. i would try and tell you "they're only leaves, baby" and make you stay on the ground. but you were so afraid and you cried so hard, your mother would always pick you up. she always picked you up.}

<A>__{sharonda waves maniacally. alike musters a smile and puts a hand on the window. laura raises a fist. the bus sails away from the curb. alike leans forward to keep laura and sharonda in sight as long as possible. as she faces front again, she glimpses arthur, standing in the doorway of the terminal. a passing van blots him from view and she leans back in her seat. an old korean woman next to her offers her a piece of ginger candy. alike pops the candy into her mouth and takes a deep breath. reflections of the retreating city landscape replay across alike's face and she is able to hold back neither the smile nor the tears that come.}
