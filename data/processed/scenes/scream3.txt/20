<B>__{detective kincaid and gale.}
<A>__{they walk through the set. gale's mesmerized. kincaid is all business.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{dejr vu do.}
<A>__{the pair come to a halt on the driveway of what is supposed to be the macher residence. everything from the smashed beer bottles in the garage, to the boat on the driveway is mimicked to a perfect t. even a foam dummy of tatum rielly dangles from the doggy door, head squashed a bloody mess. gale stares at the swaying dummy, haunted.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{well well, someone dies and gale weathers comes running. what a shock.}
<A>__{gale looks up. dewey stands beside her.}
<C>__{detective kincaid}
<D>__{mr. rielly? my name is mark kincaid. i'm with the l.a.p.d. are you aware of last night's events?}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{yeah. a real tragedy.}
<A>__{dewey stares daggers through gale. there is a real bitter coldness between the two.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about sidney. we need to know where she is.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{what so you can just exploit her again with another book? sid doesn't need you gale.}
<C>__{gale}
<P>__{(to kincaid)}
<D>__{show him.}
<C>__{detective kincaid}
<D>__{mr. rielly, this was found alongside the bodies of ben and his girlfriend.}
<A>__{kincaid hands dewey the ziplocked clipping. dewey examines it, his fear slowly growing.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{i promised sid i'd keep her in seclusion. i promised her nobody would ever find her. if you don't mind detective, i'd like to approach her with this on my own and see what she'd like to do about it.}
<A>__{kincaid nods.}
<C>__{detective kincaid}
<D>__{that's fine mr. rielly, but if anyone else should die, i'm going to have to get a warrant.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{understood.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{if you'll excuse me detective.}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{gale.}
<A>__{dewey walks off camera. kincaid puts his hand on gale's shoulder.}
<C>__{detective kincaid}
<D>__{i'm going to have a little chat with the producers. don't wander off. i may need you.}
<A>__{gale nods as kincaid disappears into the backdrop of the set. a shrill voice}
<B>__{o.s.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{gale weathers! oh my god!}
<A>__{jennifer jolie, an ambitious young starlet, playing gale in the latest stab, rushes towards her, with arms wide open. she's decked out in the flashy neon green ensemble gale wore in the first film and even sports a fake shiner on her right eye. gale is obviously pissed. she knows this actress and doesn't really want to be in her company very long.}
<D>__{gale shit. jennifer listen, i know we've never met, and i don't mind you never returning my calls, but i have to tell you that after two films i feel like i am in your mind. gale well, that would explain my constant headaches. jennifer}
<P>__{(defensively)}
<D>__{you know i'm sorry that things didn't work out on '60 minutes ii', but 'total entertainment' that's a pretty good fall back. gale thank you. i'm sorry that things didn't work out with brad pitt, but being single, that's a pretty good fall back. jennifer gives me more time for my work. after all, gale weathers, you're such a complex character. gale and to be played by an actress with such depth and range.}
<A>__{dewey steps back into the picture, cell phone in hand.}
<D>__{dewey no answer at sid's. where'd the detective go?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(excitedly)}
<D>__{dewey!}
<A>__{gale stares at the couple, just processing things in her head.}
<D>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(fondles dewey's butt)}
<D>__{gale, i think you'll really appreciate my character work in this one, someone's helped me understand the real you. gale someone? jennifer the ruthless ambition, your private self loathing, and that lost and lonely little girl inside. gale lost and lonely what? jennifer you heard me.}
<P>__{(takes dewey's cellular)}
<D>__{thanks dewey. i will return it. gale lost and lonely what? dewey little girl inside. gale i thought you were supposed to be in woodsboro! dewey well, i'm surprised you thought about me at all. listen i gotta get back to trying to get hold of sid. besides, she's more important than you ever were. gale wait! dewey we can work on this together! as a team! like in the past! dewey no really gale, that's a sweet offer, but this time i'd like to catch the killer before the body count gets any higher.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{toodles.}
<A>__{dewey walks away leaving gale alone. kincaid enters frame, talking to two producers. the elder, sixty five year old buddy shayne, a towering, hefty man with gray hair. the second, bigwig horror producer john milton, a creepy fifty something with penetrating eyes and a menacing demeanor. the two talk, ignoring gale the entire time. she's almost eavesdropping on their conversation.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{i can assure you that security on the set will be at an all time high. again, the deaths are sheer tragedy.}
<C>__{detective kincaid}
<D>__{well, i'd hate to see the production shut down.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i myself am a big stab fan.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{really?}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{have you ever thought about acting? you've got just the right face.}
<C>__{detective kincaid}
<D>__{i am kind of dedicated to my job. although i do enjoy taking acting classes on my weekends. i grew up around these studios anyway. i know my way around. my uncle was a screenwriter for paramount.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{really, what was his name?}
<A>__{before kincaid can finish, gale buts in.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{excuse me detective, i think we have some business to attend to.}
<C>__{milton}
<P>__{(flabbergasted)}
<D>__{gale weathers?! what are you doing here? no press on the set!}
<P>__{(to security)}
<D>__{no press, no press on set! get that woman out of here.}
<C>__{security gaurd}
<P>__{(approaching)}
<D>__{yes, mr. milton.}
<C>__{detective kincaid}
<D>__{no, mr. milton, miss weathers is with me.}
<A>__{milton nods his head, flags down the guard. he walks away.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{well then, i guess i will be leaving then.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{oh come on! why the hostility?}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{listen lois lane, i love your show and all but last month i happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because i'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. it was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.}
<C>__{gale}
<P>__{(shit eating smile on her face)}
<D>__{they're the ones who approved it.}
<A>__{milton storms off camera, buddy following close behind. gale looks up at kincaid.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{alright kincaid, no where to?}
<C>__{detective kincaid}
<D>__{i go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being gale weathers.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{oh. i thought you wanted me to stick around.}
<C>__{detective kincaid}
<D>__{look, miss weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. here's my card. i'm always there.}
<A>__{kincaid hands gale his card, begins to walk out of the building.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{shit. can i even get a ride home?}
