<A>__{ace and sherbert watch as a stage manager weighs in the 'femme fatale' showgirls.}
<C>__{nicky }
<D>__{but i will tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds. he knew all the fuckin' angles. he brought over the whole 'femme fatale' show from paris. but he forgot how lazy them european dancin' broads can get. i mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons.}
<C>__{ace}
<P>__{(to showgirl)}
<D>__{you're still eight pounds over.}
<P>__{(to manager.)}
<D>__{what's the reason for this?}
<C>__{stage manager}
<D>__{mr rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{never mind the 'sir'. never mind the 'sir'.}
<C>__{stage manager}
<D>__{well, sir, i was just...}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{why is she eight pounds over?}
<C>__{stage manager}
<D>__{...trying to offer you the respect that your...}

<C>__{stage manager}
<D>__{...and she doesn't always }
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{...all you do is give me answers. just just give me the right answer.}
<C>__{stage manager}
<D>__{but, sir. well, i don't know why. i guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{that's right. she will get fired. in fact, i want you to send her back to paris.}
<C>__{stage manager}
<D>__{it's always been our policy }
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{no. just stop everything.}
<A>__{sherbert and ace walk away across a huge stage.}
<C>__{sherbert}
<P>__{(to ace)}
<D>__{this woman's an institution.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{i don't care what she is. she's an institution, that's the problem. she's lazy.}
