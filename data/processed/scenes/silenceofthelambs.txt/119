<A>__{close on an open, multi tiered jewelry box, resting atop a bureau, as clarice's fingers pick through costume jewelry. clarice closes the box, and is just turning away when a figure suddenly looms into shot, giving her a bad start; she cries out softly. senator martin is revealed, staring at her suspiciously.}

<D>__{miss starling, you may know the deputy attorney general, mr. krendler. paul, this is the trainee that jack crawford sent to lecter... she lied to him, pretending to have my authority, and thus jeopardized this entire investigation. now she has the further gall to invade my daughter's privacy, again without permission. if her little games have killed my baby...}
<A>__{overcome, she hurries from the room. krendler shuts the door behind her, points sternly at clarice.}

<D>__{you're out of line, starling, and you're off this case. back to quantico.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{sir, mr. crawford instructed me }
<C>__{krendler}
<D>__{your instructions are what i'm giving you now. jack crawford answers to the director, and the director answers to me. my god, crawford's losing it...! he shouldn't even be on this, with his wife sick as she is... how the hell did you get in here, anyway? he gave you what? some kind of special id? let's have it.}

<D>__{lecter has already named buffalo bill.}
<A>__{clarice reacts, surprised. krendler takes a folded computer sheet from his pocket, shoves it at her. she takes it, reads.}
<C>__{krendler}
<D>__{he gave us a perfectly good description, and we're on it now, so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer or his, either. he's under close guard at the courthouse, pending a prison transfer. the next plane, officer.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{sir, doesn't this "william rubin" strike you as i don't know kind of vague?}
<A>__{krendler moves in very close to her, pale with anger.}
<C>__{krendler}
<D>__{do you need a police escort, starling? or do you think you can find the airport by yourself?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{yes sir. i can find it by myself.}
