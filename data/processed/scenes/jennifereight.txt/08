<L>__{8: interior living room kitchen. house. dawn.}
<A>__{the voice comes via a police scanner. most of this dialogue's bullshit. illegally parked autos and a few drunks still about. berlin sits on the mattress eating a breakfast of chewing gum and milk. he unwraps another juicy fruit and regrets it. goes round his mouth like a shoe in a washing machine. a reluctant decision is taken. spits gum at the sink as he arrives in the kitchen. starts unloading his leather bag. a flotsam of stuff is excavated including a 9mm beretta and a pack of cigarettes. he lights up and takes a cruel hit full of nicotine and guilt. wouldn't need a clairvoyant to realize he's trying to give up. something on the scanner interests him and he wanders back to the living room. there's a call going out for "david 72 sam 3." david 72 acknowledges and berlin clearly recognizes the voice. "we have a 927d springfield street city dump." but david 72 is already hired. "i'm outside emersons i wanna be the first horrible face of her day." berlin exhales through a smile. the controller needs an e.t.a. for the 927? david 72 doesn't know. advises her to roll a couple of cars and "secure the location."}
