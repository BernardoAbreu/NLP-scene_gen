<L>__{exterior hollywood night}
<A>__{the soundtrack opens with frank sinatra's "fly me to the moon". a helicopter shot of the l.a. basin. the pool of golden light disintegrates into the thousands of points which constitute it as we rapidly draw closer to the city. we are just above the tops of the highest buildings as we approach hollywood boulevard. below is neon and the icy thrust of search lights rotating on the corner of hollywood and vine. we continue west, then quickly north. there is the momentary appearance of the moonlit hollywood sign as we pass the blinking red beacon of the capital records building and drop into franklin avenue and over the architectural remnants of hollywood's past whip up. we are heading east at treetop level. a warm glow in the distance quickly grows into a modest commercial strip which includes cafes, bookstores, and a theater. we drop to eye level as we spy through the plate glass showcase window of the "bourgeois pig" coffeehouse, which holds the translucent reflection of the full moon. a cigarette wedged between knuckles smoulders. mike takes the last drag with great effort, then crushes it out. he sits in the window sprawled across a red velvet couch that once perfectly complemented a faux spanish foyer.}

<C>__{mike}
<D>__{and what if i don't want to give up on her?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{you don't call.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{but you said i shouldn't call if i wanted to give up on her.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{so i don't call either way.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{so what's the difference?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{the only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. see, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. you can only do things to make her not want to come back.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{so the only difference is if i forget about her or pretend to forget about her.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{well that sucks.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{it sucks.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{so it's almost a retroactive decision. so i could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like i just pretended to forget about her.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{right...or more likely the opposite.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{right... wait, what do you mean?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{unless she comes back first.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{ah, see, that's the thing. somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{there's the rub.}

<D>__{there's the rub.}
<C>__{mike}

<D>__{hi, lorraine. thanks for holding on.}
<C>__{lorraine}
<D>__{listen, mike. you really didn't have to get off the line. i just wanted to ask you one thing. i know i shouldn't have called, i mean, my friends said i should wait two days... oh god, i probably sound like such a schoolgirl... it's just that it's tonight only... i mean, it's sinatra's birthday and they have this thing every year at "the room". do you know where that is? it's impossible to find if you've never been there. i don't understand why none of the clubs in hollywood have signs. anyway, i'm so bad at this, if you're not busy i thought you might...}
<A>__{mike smiles as the camera pulls back from the window and backwards down franklin avenue in a reverse of the first shot of the movie. the soundtrack kicks in with sinatra's "here's to the losers"....}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{here's to those who love not too wisely, no, not too wisely, but too well... to the girl who sighs with envy when she hears that wedding bell... to the guy who'd throw a party if he knew someone to call... here's to the losers... bless them all...}
<A>__{...we rise and pass the glowing hollywood sign. it's still a full moon...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{here's to those who drink their dinners when that lady doesn't show... to the girls who wait for kisses underneath that mistletoe... to the lonely summer lovers when the leaves begin to fall... here's to the losers... bless them all...}
<A>__{.... past the blinking red beacon of the capital records building...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{hey tom, dick and harry... come in out of the rain... those torches you carry... must be drowned in champagne...}
<A>__{... up and over hollywood boulevard. high above the city...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{here's the last toast of the evening... here's to those who still believe... all the losers will be winners... all the givers shall receive... here's to trouble free tomorrows... may your sorrows all be small... here's to the losers... bless them all.}
<A>__{... it's all just a pool of beautiful golden light.}
