<L>__{interior barton park drawing room eve}
<A>__{dinner is over. marianne sits listlessly by the window. mr palmer is hiding behind a newspaper. sir john and margaret are looking at a map and discussing routes through china. lucy, charlotte, mrs dashwood and mrs jennings are at cards. elinor is reading.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{oh! if only this rain would stop!}
<C>__{mr palmer}
<P>__{(from behind the paper)}
<D>__{if only you would stop.}
<A>__{mrs jennings and charlotte laugh at him.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{'twas you took her off my hands, mr palmer, and a very good bargain you made of it too, but now i have the whip hand over you for you cannot give her back!}
<A>__{the heavy silence behind the paper attests to the unhappy truth of this statement.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{miss marianne, come and play a round with us! looking out at the weather will not bring him back.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<P>__{(sotto voce)}
<D>__{she ate nothing at dinner.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{mind, we are all a little forlorn these days. london has swallowed all our company.}
<A>__{charlotte and mrs jennings start to gossip about the disappearances of brandon and willoughby. lucy walks over and sits by elinor, who politely puts aside the book.}
<C>__{lucy}
<P>__{(low)}
<D>__{dear miss dashwood, perhaps now we might have our discussion.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{our discussion?}
<A>__{lucy looks around at mrs jennings and lowers her voice still further, so that elinor is obliged to move her chair nearer.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{there is a particular question i have long wanted to ask you, but perhaps you will think me impertinent?}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{i cannot imagine so.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{but it is an odd question. forgive me, i have no wish to trouble you }
<A>__{she looks away coyly as if deciding whether to speak.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{my dear miss steele }
<C>__{charlotte}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{miss dashwood, if only mr willoughby had gone home to combe magna, we could have taken miss marianne to see him! for we live but half a mile away.}
<C>__{mr palmer}
<D>__{five and a half.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{no, i cannot believe it is that far, for you can see the place from the top of our hill. is it really five and a half miles? no! i cannot believe it.}
<C>__{mr palmer}
<D>__{try.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{you have my permission to ask any manner of question, if that is of any help.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{thank you. i wonder, are you at all acquainted with your sister in law's mother? mrs ferrars?}
<A>__{elinor sits back in deep surprise.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{with fanny's mother? no, i have never met her.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{i am sure you think me strange for inquiring if i dared tell }
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<P>__{(shouting over)}
<D>__{if she tells you aught of the famous 'mr f', lucy, you are to pass it on.}
<A>__{elinor tries to ignore mrs jennings, who is keeping a curious eye on them.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{will you take a turn with me, miss dashwood?}
<A>__{lucy rises and takes elinor's arm. she guides her as far away as possible from mrs jennings and charlotte.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{i had no idea at all that you were connected with that family.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{oh! i am certainly nothing to mrs ferrars at present but the time may come when we may be very intimately connected.}
<C>__{elinor}
<P>__{(low)}
<D>__{what do you mean? do you have an understanding with fanny's brother robert?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{the youngest? no, i never saw him in my life. no, with edward.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{edward?}
<A>__{elinor stops walking.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{edward ferrars?}
<A>__{lucy nods.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{edward and i have been secretly engaged these five years.}
<A>__{elinor is frozen to the spot.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{you may well be surprised. i should never have mentioned it, had i not known i could entirely trust you to keep our secret. edward cannot mind me telling you for he looks on you quite as his own sister.}
<A>__{elinor walks on mechanically. disbelief has set in.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{i am sorry, but we surely we cannot mean the same mr ferrars?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{the very same he was four years under the tutelage of my uncle mr pratt, down in plymouth. has he never spoken of it?}
<C>__{elinor}
<P>__{(awareness dawning)}
<D>__{mr pratt! yes, i believe he has.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{i was very unwilling to enter into it without his mother's approval but we loved each other with too great a passion for prudence. though you do nor know him so well as i, miss dashwood, you must have seen how capable he is of making a woman sincerely attached to him. i cannot pretend it has not been very hard on us both. we can hardly meet above twice a year.}
<A>__{she sniffs and produces a large handkerchief which she holds to her eyes so that the monogram is clearly visible. ecf. elinor, seeing the copy of the handkerchief she has held so dear, moves quickly to a chair and sits down.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{you seem out of sorts, miss dashwood are you quite well?}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{perfectly well, thank you.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{i have not offended you?}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{on the contrary.}
<A>__{mrs jennings has been watching. now she rises, unable to contain herself.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{i can stand it no longer, i must know what you are saying, lucy! miss dashwood is quite engrossed!}
<A>__{mrs jennings starts to bear down on them. lucy whispers with real urgency.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{oh, miss dashwood, if anyone finds out, it will ruin him you must not tell a soul! edward says you would not break your word to save your life! promise me!}
<A>__{ecu on elinor's face.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{i give you my word.}
<A>__{mrs jennings looms over them.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{well, what can have fascinated you to such an extent, miss dashwood?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{tell us all!}
<A>__{elinor cannot speak but lucy glides smoothly in.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{we were talking of london, ma'am, and all its diversions.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{do you hear, charlotte?}
<A>__{mrs jennings claps her hands delightedly.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{while you were so busy whispering, charlotte and i have concocted a plan!}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{it is the best plan in the world.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{i make for london shortly and i invite you, lucy, and both the misses dashwood to join me!}
<A>__{elinor cannot hide her dismay. marianne springs from her seat.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{london!}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{oh, can i go! can i go?}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{you know perfectly well you are too young, dearest.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{i shall convey you all to my house in berkeley street and we shall taste all the delights of the season what say you?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{oh, please can i go? i'm twelve soon.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{mr palmer, do you not long to have the misses dashwood come to london?}
<C>__{mr palmer}
<D>__{i came into devonshire with no other view.}
<A>__{elinor exerts herself.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{mrs jennings, you are very kind, but we cannot possibly leave our mother...}
<A>__{lucy's calculating eyes turn to mrs dashwood with alacrity.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{indeed, the loss would be too great.}
<A>__{a chorus of objections goes up, particularly from mrs dashwood, who is both delighted and relieved to see marianne with a smile on her face.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{your mother can spare you very well.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{of course i can!}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{of course she can!}
<C>__{sir john}
<D>__{and look at miss marianne it would break her heart to deny her!}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{i will brook no refusal, miss dashwood!}
<A>__{marianne claps her hands, her eyes ablaze with joy. mrs jennings takes elinor's hand.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{let you and me strike hands upon the bargain and if i do not have the three of you married by christmas, it will not be my fault!}
