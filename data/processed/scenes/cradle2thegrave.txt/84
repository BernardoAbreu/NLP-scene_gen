<L>__{interior korean club day}
<A>__{a hostess bar, but very high end. beautiful women. elegant decor. pumping music. no strip club cheese. for extra money, private rooms for private pleasures. it's day, but the place is wall to wall with korean men. chambers' african americans maintain low visibility: at the door, behind the scenes, counting the register, etc. odion, a dangerous looking chambers main man, moves through the crowd to daria, waiting near the front door.}
<C>__{odion}
<D>__{delicious daria.}
<C>__{daria}
<D>__{'sup, odion?}
<C>__{odion}
<D>__{long time no see.}
<A>__{then, checking her out }
<C>__{odion}
<D>__{like cognac. just getting better.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{so what brings you around?}
<C>__{daria}
<D>__{... sometimes you need an old friend, y'know?}
<C>__{odion}
<D>__{got trouble?}
<C>__{daria}
<D>__{... with a capital 't.'}
<C>__{odion}
<D>__{tony fait? thought you and him were tight. bonnie and clyde.}
<C>__{daria}
<D>__{used to be that way. not treating me right these days. the kid's all he cares about.}
<C>__{odion}
<D>__{... what do you want me to do?}
<C>__{daria}
<D>__{... man, i don't know. probably nothing you can do. i just thought...}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{hey, y'know, this is crazy. i don't know what i was thinking. i shouldn't even be here like this. sorry, odion.}
<A>__{daria starts to go. odion stops her.}
<C>__{odion}
<D>__{nah, hey, hold up. it's okay.}
<C>__{daria}
<D>__{back in the day... just always seemed like you and i had something special between us.}
<C>__{odion}
<D>__{didn't know you thought so.}
<C>__{daria}
<D>__{i always cared for you, odion. that's why i'm here.}
<C>__{odion}
<D>__{... you looking for a job?}
<C>__{daria}
<D>__{i need something.}
<C>__{odion}
<D>__{... so maybe you could work here.}
<C>__{daria}
<D>__{here?... oh, man, i don't know.}
<C>__{odion}
<D>__{you were the best. not many girls pulling in two g's a night.}
<C>__{daria}
<D>__{yeah, but it's been a while for that... might not remember how.}
<C>__{odion}
<D>__{just like a bicycle, baby. you don't forget that stuff.}
<A>__{daria considers it a moment.}
<C>__{daria}
<D>__{don't know how jump'd feel about it. having me back.}
<C>__{odion}
<D>__{hey, you let me worry about jump, okay?}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{meantime, why don't you come on in, and you and me can, y'know, talk some more about it.}
<A>__{beat. daria knows the look in his eyes. gets the subtexterior}
<C>__{daria}
<D>__{... just talk?}
<A>__{odion's drinking her in.}
<C>__{odion}
<D>__{... no.}
<A>__{a beat. then, as daria reaches out and slips her hand into odion's, smiling at him }
