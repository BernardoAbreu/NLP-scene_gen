<A>__{apartment bathroom night someone shoved a nude girl into the bathtub which is now filled with congealed red jello. the boys are laughing and shoving each other about roughly. charlie comes out of the next room and walks along in a christ like manner through the madness, his arms outstretched. one boy kneels and kisses the hem of his robe and charlie blesses him. there is a great deal of pushing and shoving going on inside the bathroom and near the doorway. charlie promises to save the sinner as he pushes his way through. he helps the girl remove the jello from her body and helps her out of the bathtub. it is obvious that she is quite stoned. she caresses him and they find themselves kissing. the others storm into the bathroom and grab charlie.}
