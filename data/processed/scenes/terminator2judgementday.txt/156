<A>__{reviewing medication with the night attendant. on silberman, yawning, looking at his watch. he turns to go... sarah is there. she slams into him, hurling him through the door into the cage and follows him in. the orderly jumps up, going for his stunner, but she nails him with douglas' baton. whap whap whap! you can barely see the thing she's swinging it so fast. the guys goes down. silberman lunges for the alarm button and she cracks down hard on his arm. he cries out and grabs his wrist. she grabs him by the hair and slams him face down on the desk, smacking him behind the knees expertly with the baton. his legs buckle and he drops to his knees with his chin on the desk. she pins him with one hand. he face is full of outraged disbelief.}
