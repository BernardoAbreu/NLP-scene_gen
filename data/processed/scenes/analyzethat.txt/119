<L>__{exterior back yard swimming pool day}
<A>__{a big, family barbecue is going on in a back yard in queens. several children are splashing in an over sized, above ground swimming pool. oddly, the children appear to be shouting and laughing but make no sound. at the barbecue, nicky caesar is watching his friend mello turn italian sausage on the grill.}
<C>__{caesar}
<D>__{i like mine burnt.}
<C>__{mello}
<D>__{i don't know how you like your sausage? twenty fuckin' years we been doin' this. so you got the money?}
<A>__{the wind shifts and blows the smoke from the barbecue in their faces.}
<C>__{caesar}
<P>__{(coughing, eyes watering)}
<D>__{not all of it. i'm still light about fifteen large.}
<P>__{(blinded by smoke)}
<D>__{can we cut? this is ridiculous.}
<C>__{raoul }
<P>__{(shouts)}
<D>__{cut! can you do something about the fucking smoke?}
<A>__{we pull back to reveal the set of "little caesar." assistant directors and production assistants echo the director: "we're cut!" "reset!" "effects!" vitti observes the action sitting in a director's chair, still brooding over the previous night's events. raoul sits next to him.}
<C>__{raoul}
<P>__{(to vitti)}
<D>__{this is the problem with shooting on location. but it's worth it for the authenticity.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{yeah, this is real authentic.}
<C>__{raoul}
<P>__{(calls out)}
<D>__{tony! come here a second.}
<P>__{(to vitti)}
<D>__{anthony bella. he plays nicky caesar.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{i know who he is. they used to watch the show up at sing sing.}
<C>__{raoul}
<P>__{(delighted)}
<D>__{are you shitting me?}
<A>__{anthony bella joins them.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{tony, this is paul vitti.}
<C>__{tony bella}
<P>__{(australian accent)}
<D>__{you don't have to tell me who he is.}
<P>__{(shakes paul's hand)}
<D>__{it's a pleasure, mate.}
<C>__{vitti}
<P>__{(reacting to accent)}
<D>__{mate? i don't believe this! you're an english guy? you ain't even italian.}
<C>__{tony bella}
<D>__{australian italian. we got some paisans down under.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{down under what?}
<C>__{raoul}
<P>__{(to tony bella)}
<D>__{how incredible is this? paul tells me they watch the show in sing sing!}
<C>__{tony bella}
<D>__{fantastic! that's so fuckin' great.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{i wouldn't wet my pants over it. they watch 'supermarket sweep,' too.}
<A>__{raoul laughs hard.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{you laugh too much.}
<C>__{tony bella}
<D>__{so, paul, you going to join us?}
<A>__{vitti looks around, his future plans now beginning to form.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{yeah. you got a good setup here.}
<C>__{tony bella}
<D>__{great. see you later then.}
<A>__{he exits. vitti turns to raoul.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{coupla things, though. i don't know who makes these decisions, but some of this, it don't look right.}
<C>__{raoul}
<P>__{(concerned)}
<D>__{i sensed it myself. which elements strike you as wrong?}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{the people mainly. i mean, you got a boss who speaks australian. what the fuck is that? and i'm guessing your background is what?}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{the theater, mostly.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{yeah, the theater. so how about if i bring in some guys that i know you know, more 'authentic.'}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{i would be eternally grateful. anything else?}
<C>__{vitti}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{yeah. one of those trailers like the stars have.}
<C>__{raoul}
<P>__{(slight hesitation)}
<D>__{done.}
<P>__{(shakes his hand)}
<D>__{i will put that in the works right now.}
<A>__{he hurries off to talk to his assistant. jelly comes up to vitti.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{you really gonna do this?}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{no fuckin' way. i've had it with this job bullshit. a week of this and i'd either shoot myself or shoot raoul. but it's good cover while i figure out my next move. call the guys.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{you got it.}
