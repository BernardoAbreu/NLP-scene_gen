<L>__{interior mason dixie pawnshop day}
<A>__{maynard, a hillbilly lookin' boy, stands behind the counter of his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of butch races into his world.}
<C>__{maynard}
<D>__{can i help you wit' somethin'?}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{shut up!}
<A>__{butch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands next to the door.}
<C>__{maynard}
<D>__{now you just wait one goddamn minute}
<A>__{before maynard can finish his threat, marsellus charges in. he doesn't get past the doorway because butch lands his fist in marsellus' face. the gangster's feet go out from under him and the big man falls flat on his back. outside, two police cars with their sirens blaring race by. butch pounces on the fallen body, punching him twice more in the face. butch takes the gun out of marsellus' hand, than grabs ahold of his middle finger.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{so you like chasing people, huh?}
<A>__{he breaks the finger. marsellus lets out a pain sound. butch then places the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, pulls back the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to shield the splatter.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{well guess what, big man, you caught me}
<C>__{maynard }
<D>__{hold it right there, godammit!}
<A>__{butch and marsellus look up at maynard, who's brandishing a pumpaction shotgun, aimed at the two men.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{look mister, this ain't any of your business}
<C>__{maynard}
<D>__{i'm makin' it my business! now toss that gun!}
<A>__{butch does.}
<C>__{maynard}
<D>__{now you on top, stand up and come to the counter.}
<A>__{butch slowly gets up and moves to the counter. as soon as he gets there, maynard hauls off, hitting him hard in the face with the butt of the shotgun, knocking butch down and out. after butch goes down, maynard calmly lays the shotgun on the counter and moves to the telephone. marsellus wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily watches the pawnshop owner dial a number. maynard waits on the line while the other end rings. then it picks up.}
<C>__{maynard}
<D>__{zed? it's maynard. the spider just caught a coupl'a flies.}
<A>__{marsellus passes out.}
