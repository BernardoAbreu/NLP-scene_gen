<C>__{mrs. hathaway}
<D>__{you do have a choice! we all do!!! john, i've never asked you to stop. i've never asked you to give up or walk away.}
<A>__{joe looks back at the headlights and sees something very odd: the distant vehicle turns onto the tracks. push in on joe, unsettled as the train crosses them now joe looks back toward alice a blast of air, shockingly loud!}
<C>__{mrs. hathaway }
<D>__{but i'm asking you now please. for me. don't go back. don't leave me. i need to know this isn't the last time i will see you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i just love you so much.}

<C>__{detective hathaway}
<D>__{i love you too!!}
<A>__{and joe finally swings the mike down and yells:}

<C>__{joe }
<D>__{alice!}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{joe, we have to go.}
<A>__{they run off.}
<C>__{charles }
<D>__{i don't want to die!!!}
<A>__{as nearby cars rip off tracks, tumble cars from father back jettison toward them, slamming into the depot, shattering it the entire area is decimated in an instant! and then it's over. just the odd, dying chugs and screech screech screech of train wheels running out of momentum, hisses of steam, the unnatural bending of steel. in the dust, joe lies frightened on the ground, eyes tightly shut. his mind races, his heart pounds and then: a loud metal bang! joe stands up fast, faces a mountain of twisted steel upside down train cars piled frighteningly around him. just another few feet and he would've been crushed. but what was that sound? something metal? then again: slam! joe backs up, afraid it was almost a labored groan mechanical or animal?! a crazy screech, another bang, then again and again!!! we see joe tightly gripping his necklace locket in his hand then: crash! awful loud and a twisted ten foot square}
<B>__{sheet of metal explodes from behind the overturned train cars}
<A>__{ joe covers his head as the metal stabs the ground, twenty feet away: a train sliding door. joe turns to see it stunned then back to the direction of the noise but it is gone. nothing. tight on charles' camera on its side, finishing up a}

<C>__{joe }
<D>__{guys?!}
<A>__{joe finds martin, on his knees, throwing up martin keeps throwing up, but pumps a thumbs up.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{martin, are you okay?! preston, is that you?}
<C>__{preston}
<D>__{i'm okay! though i think i'm having a heart attack! and i have a scrape!}
<A>__{joe moves forward up to camera behind him, cary appears, smiling. this kid enjoyed the crash:}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{guys, did you see those explosions? that was awesome.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{has anyone seen alice?!}
<C>__{charles }
<D>__{i'm alive! is anyone dead?}
<A>__{through the debris, steel and dust. joe moves forward charles, shaken, eyes wide, appears through the thick dust joe moves forward, looking at, under a train wheel assembly... blood. a puddle of blood and joe's heart sinks as he moves toward it another woman he loves, crushed?! charles and preston and cary see the blood }
<D>__{charles (cont'd) preston}
<A>__{ oh god no nonono... martin, still sick, calls out:}
<C>__{martin cary}
<A>__{ what? guys, what is it? ... shit... joe moves closer to the blood heartsick on the verge of deep, real tears everything stops but then:}
<C>__{alice }
<D>__{ what's all that blood?}
<A>__{joe whips around standing in the dusty mess is alice shaken, but absolutely alive. joe just beams.}
<C>__{alice }
<D>__{what's the blood? did someone get hurt ?}
<A>__{but joe suddenly knows he moves to the blood reaches below the wheels the others watch, freaked out }
<C>__{kids }
<D>__{joe, wait maybe you shouldn't touch what are you careful!}
<A>__{joe pulls out his crushed make up kit. he brightens:}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{it's my fake blood. it's fake!}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{what is this stuff?}
<A>__{alice notices that he's holding the necklace. joe notices this and pockets it self consciously. preston calls out:}
<C>__{preston}
<D>__{guys, what are these things?}
<A>__{joe looks they all move to preston (except cary, who heads off): crates have spilled from a nearby split car; many shattered, revealing thousands of small white metal cubes which now litter the ground. joe kneels, picks one up:}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{hey, don't touch it, what are you doing?}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{they look like white rubik's cubes or something. they're heavy like metal or something. there's like a billion of them.}
<A>__{it's just a few inches per side, an unusual design. behind them, having walked up the angled sides of overturned train cars, cary calls out:}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{guys, get up here. you can see everything from up here.}
<A>__{they move up the mass of metal, revealing a vast view of the wreck. it seems to stretch on forever. it is sobering.}
<C>__{charles cary}
<A>__{oh my god. ... look at that...}
<C>__{preston}
<D>__{according to my uncle seth, an accident like this is exceptionally rare.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{it wasn't an accident.}
<P>__{(turns away, eyes on the field)}
<D>__{there was a truck. on the tracks.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{what? driving on the tracks?}
<A>__{joe's seen it. he points. chilled.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{there.}
<A>__{thrown fifty yards from the main wreckage is the pick up truck. sheared in half upon impact and lying in the overgrown grass.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{how can a pick up truck derail a train? that's impossible.}
<C>__{preston}
<D>__{obviously it isn't.}
<A>__{boom up from behind the shattered pick up as the kids approach from the wreckage. push in on them as they arrive at the truck and stop; what they see makes joe's heart pound they're stunned all of them. they just stop. finally:}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{... holy shit...}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{ is that him?}
<C>__{alice}
<P>__{(covers her mouth))}
<D>__{ yeah, it's him }
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{ who?}
<C>__{preston charles}
<A>__{it is, yeah, for sure holy shit.}
<C>__{martin }
<D>__{what? who is that?}
<A>__{we see now: it's dr. woodward 75, seat belted, bloody and unconscious, stuck inside the crushed wreckage. alice moves closer scared and sad for him }
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{dr. woodward...?}
<A>__{no one can take their eyes off this as, sotto:}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{that's dr. woodward? the science guy?}
<C>__{preston}
<D>__{biology.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{honors biology.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{wow... i'm not in his class.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{we know.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{shut up, cary.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{remember when old man woodward took your electronic football?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{yeah, he put it in the "dungeon," never gave it back...}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{the dungeon?}
<C>__{preston}
<D>__{that trailer woodward keeps in the school parking lot.}
<A>__{joe moves next to alice, who reaches out and gently nudges him you keep expecting him to suddenly grab her }
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{... dr. woodward?}
<A>__{but he's apparently dead; when she nudges him, he leans, his arm drops limp from the steering wheel, where he was holding a paper, that has now fallen onto the ground. joe picks it up. unfolds it: it's an old map thin, off white paper. they hold it up, the map now backlit and obscuring woodward. we see marker writing on it a black line, from nevada to dayton and numbers written along the way.}
<C>__{preston joe}
<A>__{map of the contiguous united states... what's the writing?}
<D>__{alice (cont'd) charles}
<A>__{ dates and times. what's that line across?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{it's a schedule for the train.}
<A>__{but a shadow has appeared: a trembling hand before they can react, it rips the map away they all scream as old dr. woodward is revealed, bloody eyes open, in a daze:}
<C>__{dr. woodward}
<D>__{ who who are you?}
<A>__{they're all speechless for a moment. finally, too loudly:}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{dr. woodward! it's charles kaznyk! from fourth period! you've been in an accident!}
<B>__{but woodward has reached into his jacket and pulled out a gun}
<A>__{ the kids jump back, stunned }
<C>__{dr. woodward}
<D>__{they will kill you. do not speak of this or you and your parents will die.}
<A>__{we're on joe's stunned face but distant voices make him turn his head: hundreds of yards away, through the wreck, figures with flashlights approach fast }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{ guys, look }
<A>__{the rest turn to look their minds are racing, all of them:}
<C>__{alice}
<P>__{(scared)}

<C>__{dr. woodward}
<D>__{gooooooooo!!!}
<A>__{the kids start moving away }
<C>__{preston charles}
<A>__{my dad will de ball me! let's get out of here!!! now they're sprinting flashlight men getting closer. charles arrives on the platform, grabs his camera. alice hurries past, hunting for her keys in that big purse she eyes the flashlight men getting closer:}

<D>__{move your ass, we gotta go!!!}
<A>__{joe grabs his make up kit another duffel runs for the car, past a whining charles.}
