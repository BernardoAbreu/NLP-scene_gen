<A>__{marshall swings into the cubicle... empty. he crosses to the cargo bay parachute launch ramp hatchway. looks through the porthole. korshunov straps on one of the few remaining parachutes. he tosses the rest of the spares out onto the platform. marshall steps onto the platform. korshunov fires off a round forcing him behind the door for cover. korshunov pulls alice in front of him and yanks down the ramp activation lever.}
<C>__{korshunov}
<D>__{stay where you are.}
<A>__{the ramp lowers, and alice gets her first look at the drop. marshall watches the remaining parachutes slide off the ramp and into the stormy sky.}
<C>__{korshunov}
<D>__{there goes your ride.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{let my daughter go or i will take you out!}
<C>__{korshunov}
<D>__{if you put down the gun, i promise not to drop her on the way down.}
<A>__{korshunov backs toward the edge of the ramp, pulling a struggling and fighting alice.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{let her go now! or i will kill you.}
<A>__{korshunov is a foot away from the edge of the ramp... two steps back, he and alice will take the plunge. marshall lines up his shot. korshunov laughs as he presses his pistol to alice's ear.}
<C>__{korshunov}
<D>__{no you won't. you'll compromise... like always.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{hold on, alice.}
<A>__{marshall fires, his bullet ripping apart a good deal of korshunov's face and snapping his body back. korshunov tumbles off the platform, but his limbs are caught. in alice's. she's knocked to her belly and his dead weight drags her off the edge of the platform.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{marshall dives down the sloping platform, reaching out for her... alice tries to grip the platform with her hands, but she can't hold on. her hand slip off the metallic lip. but as she falls, she's caught by the wrist. strong arms pull her up. her father's arms. he carries her back to the safety of the plane. she's sobs uncontrollably.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{oh ny god... oh my god... oh my god...}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{it's okay, honey. i got you. i got you. you're okay.}
<A>__{shepherd and rose appear. marshall locks eyes with rose... smiles. shepherd crosses to the parachute bins.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{gone. they're all gone.}
<A>__{the plane shakes with the thunder of a supersonic boom.}
