<D>__{bill slows the rental car to turn. barb looks down the road and across the field to where the farm house peeks out through the trees, beckoning, threatening, ominous. bill pulls the rental in front of the house. turns off the ignition. neither moves to get out. jean realizes they've stopped, pulls off her headphones.}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{i'm gonna grab a smoke. jean heads for the relative privacy of the fence at the edge of the yard. leaving bill and barb alone, watching.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{you've encouraged that.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i haven't encouraged anything.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{you admire her for getting hooked at fourteen, makes her seem even more mature. barbara climbs out. bill follows.}
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{goddamn, it's hot. bill unlocks the trunk, begins unloading luggage.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{suppose your mom's turned on the air conditioner?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{you kidding? remember the parakeets?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{the parakeets?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{i didn't tell you about the parakeets? she got a parakeet for some insane reason, and the little fucker croaked after two days. so she went to the pet store and raised hell and they gave her another parakeet. that one died after one day.}
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{so she went back and they gave her a third parakeet and that one died too. so the chick from the pet store came out here to see just what in the hell this serial parakeet killer was doing to bump off these birds. they head for the house with suitcases, wilting in the heat.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{and?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{the heat. it was too hot. they were dying from the heat.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{jesus.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{these are tropical birds, all right? they live in the fucking tropics. he laughs. barb looks over to jean smoking by the fence.}
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{what, is she smoking a cigar?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{are you ready for this?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{no. no way.}
