<L>__{exterior house day}
<A>__{the deafening shriek of the blade as it cuts into the tree. malcolm is soaked in sweat. ingrid watches from a few feet away. in the distance dick's orange bmw grinds into the driveway. maisy hurries toward him. ingrid says, buried in the noise:}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{there's dick.}
<A>__{malcolm sees dick. he pushes the blade harder into the wood.}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{is it almost ready?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(distracted)}
<D>__{almost.}
<A>__{maisy is talking to her father. dick spots malcolm. he immediately starts toward him. malcolm hesitates. cold fear creeps up his neck. dick speeds up. malcolm backs up slowly drops the chainsaw and bolts toward the water. ingrid watches, confused. dick takes off after him. malcolm stumbles down the long wooden stairs to the beach. malcolm runs wobbily he pants, already out of breath. sweat pours down his face and body. dick's gait is swift his arms stiff, bent at the elbow. his jeans make a swish swish. he takes the stairs two at a time. malcolm grasps the railing, moving as fast as he can sideways, trying not to fall. he reaches the beach, his feet sinking in the sand. he trips and topples forward. he looks up dick lunges. dick pounds malcolm's head and face. malcolm throws his arms up and tries to block the punches.}

<A>__{dick marches forward and kicks malcolm again hard.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{ow!}
<A>__{dick lights a brown cigarette and walks away. malcolm screams:}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{fucking dickbag! she's lying!}

<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(choking on tears)}
<D>__{oh, man.}
<A>__{there's a rustling noise in the wind. malcolm looks a mud and sea coated wizard watches him with a panting smile.}
