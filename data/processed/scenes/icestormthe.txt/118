<L>__{interior basement. day}
<A>__{wendy and mikey stand in the middle of the semi lit basement.}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{maybe we can mess around. you know, only if you want to...}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{why did you with sandy?}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{you like him? he worships you.}
<A>__{but wendy doesn't seem to hear she's drawn to an object lying next to a bean bag chair off to one side.}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{hey, what's this?}
<A>__{with a look of utter fascination, she picks up a nixon mask, looking at it as though it were an archeological find.}
<C>__{wendy }
<D>__{wow!}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{wendy!}
<A>__{she puts the mask on.}
<C>__{wendy}
<P>__{(from behind the mask)}
<D>__{i won't take my pants off. but i will touch it. that's as far as it goes.}
<A>__{mikey looks totally confused. remaining fully clothed, wendy loosens mike's belt, showing no excitement from behind her mask, and lets him climb on top of her for a dry hump. just then, a shaft of light hits them from the top of the stairs ben towers above them, looking down. mikey flips over immediately and pulls his clothes together, grabbing a tv guide as wendy stands up, the mask still on. as ben descends mikey, still stuffing his shirt tail into his pants, pretends to flip through the tv guide.}
<C>__{mikey}
<P>__{(muttering)}
<D>__{when worlds collide.}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{4:30 movie. when worlds collide.}
<A>__{ben arrives, folds his arms.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what the hell are you kids doing down here?}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{what do you think we're doing, dad?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what do i think? i think you're probably touching each other. i think you're touching that reckless jerk off, for god's sake, and i think he's trying to get into your slacks. i think, at fourteen years of age, that you're getting ready to give up your girlhood }
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{hey, hang on there, mr. hood }
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{don't you direct a single word at me, mikey. i don't want to hear it. i will be speaking with your parents about this situation very soon. bet your ass on that, son. young lady?}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{talking to me, dad?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{who else would i be talking to? and take that thing off!}
<C>__{wendy}
<P>__{(pulling off the mask)}
<D>__{well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now, lady. let's go. right now. you and i can discuss it on the walk home.}
<A>__{she stands next to mikey for a moment, both on the verge of tears.}
