<L>__{interior kitchen dusk}
<A>__{we have never seen diane focused and again so frazzled. her words are coming in spurts. she must constantly catch her breath. the thrill in her voice is backed up against an oppressive fear.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{okay, okay... look. okay. listen. i’ve kept dana and robbie out of this, but carol anne was with me when it started so i cut her in, but dana would blab and robbie’d be up for three weeks sleeping on your side of the bed.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{diane, put the breaks on will ya. just sit down a sec.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{no, goddammit, you sit down! i mean... stand right there. and just... just have an open mind. reach back into our past when i used to know you with one and use it for the next coupla minutes.}
<A>__{carol anne suddenly appears from around the corner looking exhausted and cranky. in her hand is a san diego charger football helmet.}
<C>__{carol anne}
<D>__{mommy didn’t cook any dinner.}
<C>__{diane}
<P>__{(loud)}
<D>__{we’ll go to pizza hut, all right?}
<A>__{angle steve looking around he sees chalk marks all over the kitchen floor. arrows and squares and numbers in two colors. diane’s breathing quickens as she steadies herself. skipping to the kitchen table she takes one of the colonial country chairs from the breakfast table and scrapes it along the floor to the center of the room where four circles have been described in chalk. diane places each leg in one of the proscribed circles and looks up at steve.}
<C>__{diane}
<P>__{(last words)}
<D>__{okay... okay now, watch!! watch!!}
<A>__{she removes her hands from the back of the chair and steps aside. steve watches diane as much as the chair. he starts to step forward when diane throws both of her hands out to stop him.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{look!}
<A>__{the chair begins to tremble. it virtually jitterbugs in place... then begins to move forward picking up speed until it traverses the entire length of the kitchen ending up right in front of steve’s bullfrog eyes. angle carol anne yawning. close diane with hysterical victory in her eyes. close steve looking for wires. he kneels and feels the chair legs, then immediately looks to diane for the answer.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{it’s okay. it’s okay. look!}
<P>__{(to carol anne)}
<D>__{sweetheart, show daddy.}
<C>__{carol anne}
<P>__{(angry now)}
<D>__{i’m hungry.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{don’t argue!!}
<A>__{carol anne shrugs and puts on the football helmet. diane runs over to steve’s side and pushes the chair out of the way. carol anne sits on the floor in a circle with her name on it in yellow chalk. angle steve starts to run for her protectively. diane restrains him. low angle carol anne she starts to tremble as if on a funhouse ride. her little body begins to move forward, faster, and all the way across the kitchen floor right into diane’s arms.}
<C>__{carol anne}
<P>__{(rubbing her fanny)}
<D>__{that burned!}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{sorry, baby, floor needed more wax.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{what the fuck!!}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{you try!}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{what???}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{you can’t believe the feeling.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{what’s the gag? there a magnet back there?}
<A>__{he looks behind the door in the dining room. nothing. steve just stands for a long moment in hapless silence, then...}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{i hate pizza hut! where’s supper? i don’t understand, diane. what the hell’s going on around here?}
<A>__{steve sidesteps the chalk marks, removing himself from the active area.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{i figured i’d never explain it to you. so i showed you instead, but don’t ask me how or what. just help me figure out what to do.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{you mean there’s no gimmick?}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{not from inside the house. maybe tuthill got himself a super remote from the radio shack.}
<A>__{carol anne adjusts her helmet and sits inside her launch circle. diane and steve are having the discussion across the room and aren’t aware of her.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{maybe the shake up and this thing... relate.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{no shit.}
<C>__{carol anne}
<D>__{daddy, look at me!!}
<A>__{they turn but it’s too late. carol anne shoots across the room faster than before, and with no one to catch her. angle kitchen wall at a sickening speed her helmet smashes into the wall. diane screams. steve runs over. an eight inch hole in the wall and the cracked plastic on the helmet testify to the force of impact. carol anne is dazed but unhurt.}
<C>__{carol anne}
<D>__{you promised pizza.}
