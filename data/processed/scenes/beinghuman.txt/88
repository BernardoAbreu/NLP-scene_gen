<L>__{interior cottage day}
<A>__{hector sits at the table with beatrice and her family. there is an air of awkward silence, although the boy and girl look openly at hector, perhaps assessing him as a future father. the meal has been served in a communal pot. in beatrice's house there is the luxury of small individual plates. the others wait for hector to begin, but he indicates to the old mother to help herself first. she does, and she doesn't stop until her plate is heaped high with food. there is definitely some power play going on in the old woman's mind, although her face is all innocence. hector submits, taking only a modest portion of food. the old mother's appetite is prodigious. it is comical to watch her little frame consume so much, quietly and methodically. she is an eating machine. during the meal beatrice and hector exchange glances. but this time their talking without words is a serious affair.}
