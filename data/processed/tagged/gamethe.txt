<A>__{a seven year old birthday boy with a blindfold spins round and round, the hands of other children keep him spinning. main title. it's a game of pin the tail on the donkey. the dizzy boy is given a strip of felt, and the camera follows as he stumbles toward a large cardboard donkey. he pins the tail on its nose.}
<L>__{2. quick, ragged cuts the boy blows out candles... opens gifts...}
<A>__{a clown ties balloon animals. children, maids and butlers hover about; there's even a real live pony. the party take splace in the gardens of a massive pacific heights mansion.}

<A>__{party. he's a serious looking child, who adjusts his glasses as he poses for a shot with his mother, mrs. van orton, a stiff looking society matron. a nanny brings over an infant and gently places the baby in schuyler's arms. schuyler is ultra careful, over whelmed by the responsibility of holding his tiny brother (david).}

<A>__{track through a large master bedroom; neat, masculine and spartan, free weights, a treadmill. atop the bed a laptop computer runs stock quotes. a large screen tv plays unwatched, a familiar cnn anchor (we'll assume bernard shaw). the bang & olufsen clock radio clicks on, 6:30 am; classical music now duels with the tv report. hand annotated paperwork and stock readouts cover a night table, where the ringing multi line telephone joins the cacophony. end titles as we move toward a door, it's open a crack from this adjacent bath we hear the sound of a shower running...}

<D>__{van orton... yes, it is my birthday, bob, is that why you called...? ah... no, i'm not carrying alan baer another inch, fuck him, bg lumber is history...}
<A>__{as he speaks, he continues his morning ritual hair combing, q tips, etc. (schuyler is a man in almost constant motion.)}

<C>__{schuyler }
<D>__{ignore the rumors, alan, you know me, of course i'm behind baer grace a hundred per cent... great, see you at the shareholders' meeting next month...}
<A>__{he hangs up and honks at another driver, displaying no emotion.}
<L>__{11. i n t . v a n o r t o n o f f i c e s d a y}
<A>__{track with schuyler through an elegant suite of offices. he passes a discreet sign: "the van orton group." schuyler is on a cell phone, carrying the laptop, trailed by maria, his middle aged secretary. she bears paperwork and patiently awaits his attention.}
<C>__{schuyler }
<D>__{i've got buyers for the bg paper mill, goose the lawyers, final papers in three weeks... sure it's sad, but an old dog loses its teeth and pisses itself, you put it to sleep...}
<A>__{as schuyler walks, he's greeted by passing underlings, whom he ignores. he shuts off the phone, maria hands him a couple of items, follows him into his office.}

<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{tell him to fuck himself. nicely.}
<C>__{maria}
<P>__{(awkwardly)}
<D>__{ and, um, somebody who identified himself as, um, p.p. willy.}
<A>__{schuyler freezes at this, stares at her.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{sorry, i figured it was a crank, but he swore you'd know who he was. he wanted to meet you for lunch, i told him you had appointments all }
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{cancel. cancel the whole afternoon.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{but you }
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{do it. did he leave a number?}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{no. he just said he'd be at leo's in the haight. at noon.}
<A>__{maria hands him a slip of paper, lingers, awaiting explanation...}

<A>__{a working class bar, an alcoholic or two, pinball machines. schuyler sits a table near a window, checking his watch, it's not his kind of place. a waitress arrives in a too small uniform young, multiple earrings, christine according to her name tag.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{can i take your order?}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{i haven't seen the menu.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{oh, right. here, see ya.}
<A>__{she hands him a menu and starts off. schuyler calls after her.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{an iced tea, please }
<A>__{she waves a hand, "yeah, right," without looking back. schuyler sighs and opens the menu. suddenly, someone backhands the side of his skull, he assumes a defensive posture. schuyler sees his laughing brother: david van orton.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yo, sky. happy birthday.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<P>__{(rubs his head, annoyed)}
<D>__{thanks, "pee pee." i never get tired of that.}
<A>__{david slides into the seat opposite him. he's in his early 30's, good looking but unkempt, wears bright, funky clothes, an earring and a perpetual grin. there's an intense, edgy quality to him which schuyler has some trouble readjusting to.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{well... long time.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yeah, since mom died what, five years? so how you been?}
<C>__{schuyler}

<C>__{david}
<D>__{you're divorced...}
<P>__{(off schuyler's nod)}
<D>__{too bad, she was actually interesting.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{she stopped drinking, i guess getting rid of me was the 13th step.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{so you're all alone in the house of pain.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{i redecorated. where have you been?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{all over. nowhere in particular. didn't your fucking gumshoes keep you informed of my every movement?}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{i called them off two years ago, david. you'd kicked the heroin, you'd left the ashram, you were windsurfing somewhere in central america...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it's gorgeous down there... you should go sometime.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{look, are you in trouble, is there anything you need? you can't have gone through the trust fund...}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(looks at him, hurt)}
<D>__{that's not why i'm here, sky, i just wanted to see you... i even brought a gift, for a change.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{you didn't bake me a cake, did you?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you can't still be mad about the hash brownies...}
<A>__{schuyler's unamused by the memory. david grins and pulls a small envelope out of his pocket, tosses it on the table in front of him.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{happy birthday, bro.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{what is this.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it's a bomb. open it!}
<A>__{schuyler shrugs, opens the envelope and shakes out a business card in blue and orange: "consumer recreation services." the c, r and s are highlighted, a phone number at the bottom. schuyler picks up the card, fingers it.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{consumer recreation services. ok...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i can't tell you very much about it, that'd ruin the surprise. just promise me you'll give 'em a call.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{i don't get it.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{just call 'em. ok look, it's simple, really. they entertain you.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{is this an escort service?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{no, it's nothing like that. they're a business, they're for real... they guarantee just one thing you won't be bored.}
<A>__{schuyler gives him a bored, blank look. david throws up his hands.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{they make your life fun.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{fun.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you've heard of it.}
<A>__{christine the waitress has shown up with schuyler's iced tea. she puts it down hastily, spilling some across the table. schuyler shies away, grabbing a napkin and blotting it up before it can drip into his lap. cracking gum:}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{she moves off as schuyler tries to order, raising a finger }
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{just a cheesebur... how'd you find this place?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{old connection used to meet me here. so you gonna call 'em?}
<C>__{schuyler}
<P>__{(a sigh, carefully)}
<D>__{you know, david, this is sweet, but it's an awfully busy time, i'm in the midst of a delicate liquidation }
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(mimicking him bitterly)}
<D>__{"a delicate liquidation," god, you would do this...}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{david }
<C>__{david}
<D>__{we can't get together once without you making me feel like shit. that's important to you, isn't it?}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{forget about it, don't bother.}
<A>__{david slumps in his seat, won't meet schuyler's eyes.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{are you still on medication...?}
<A>__{david glares at him. with the impeccable timing of all waitresses, christine appears, chipper.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{you guys know what you want?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{go away.}
<A>__{she curls her lip and departs before schuyler can open his mouth. he sighs, resigned to the idea of not eating. calmly:}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i just thought you'd like it. i did, it was a blast, best thing that ever happened to me. and for your information, i'm not on anything anymore, i'm not even seeing a shrink, i'm in a better place than i've ever been, i'm even happy but that's something else i wouldn't be able to explain to you.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{ok, ok, i will give them a call...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{whatever.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{look, take a pill. just be normal for thirty seconds and tell me what this is. i hate surprises.}

<C>__{elizabeth }
<P>__{(slight chuckle; serious)}
<D>__{how are you , sky?}
<A>__{she has the concerned, forthright tone of a "recovery person," someone who's been through a lot of therapy and wants to reach out. schuyler grimaces, then mimics the tone:}

<C>__{elizabeth }
<D>__{it wasn't a trick question. thirty eight, i thought that might be a a difficult year for you...}

<D>__{never mind... we'll just have to go with the earlier draft.}
<A>__{in bg, one exec picks up a page, whispers to an assistant, who moves out of the room. schuyler moves to his briefcase. it's locked. he starts patting his pockets.}

<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{up my ass, very funny...}
<A>__{his eyes drift to a piece of corporate stationary on the table in front of him. he picks it up: insert under baer grace letterhead we see a handscrawled note: "crs called." we don't see what's written below. schuyler is reeling, paranoia confirmed.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{i don't ok. ok, you're with crs...}
<A>__{baer stares at him blankly. schuyler puts a hand over his eyes, seems disoriented, trying to piece it all together.}

<C>__{baer}
<D>__{i'm not following you.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{like hell you aren't. how did you get my brother involved, that's unforgivable.}
<A>__{the assembled execs are looking at schuyler in utter confusion. as he speaks, the assistant returns with some paperwork. schuyler stares at him menacingly. hesitantly:}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{um... sorry to interrupt. we've been having some trouble with this fax, so they re sent the material. it's all ok now.}
<A>__{the assistant comes over, cheerfully places the crucial documents in front of schuyler. the assistant fishes in his pocket.}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{oh and mr. van orton are these yours? the pilot found 'em on the floor of the chopper...}
<A>__{schuyler gingerly takes the keys which the assistant holds out, looks from them to the paperwork. then he glances back at the handwritten note on the table: insert note: it actually reads "cbs called." (schuyler's thumb or a post it note covered the base of the b before, making it look like an r.) it continues "re: interview with alan b. on sun..." schuyler takes a breath, reassembles his composure and consults his watch. he rises, anxious to put the last few minutes behind him.}

<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{if i take that stupid key, will you give me back my briefcase and go away?}
<A>__{the rasta nods with a big grin. schuyler steps forward, hand extended. the rasta flings open the door of a stall beside him and hurls the key into the toilet. instinctively, schuyler moves to grab it, reaches into the toilet, pulls out the chain, his hand and sleeve dripping. the key is missing from the end of the chain.}

<D>__{i told you, this is over! i quit!}
<C>__{rasta man}
<D>__{they all say that at first.}
<A>__{he gives schuyler a hearty slap on the back and strolls off, humming. schuyler leans against the wall, shaking his head. he puts down his luggage, pulls the sunglasses from his pocket. close on sunglasses there's the image of a tiny gold key embossed on each of the arms. schuyler puts them on, looks around for a moment, catches a glimpse of himself in the mirror he looks silly. he quickly takes them off. as schuyler heads out the door we see him from behind... the rasta has slapped a colorful sign that reads "kick me" on his back.}
