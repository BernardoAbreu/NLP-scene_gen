<B>__{high angle on the corleone mall}
<A>__{several moving vans are parked in the mall; one feels that these are the final days; the families are moving out; signs indicating that the property is for sale are evident. a black limousine pulls up, and before it has even stopped, the rear door flies open, and connie attempts to run out, restrained by mama. she manages to break free and runs across the mall into michael's house.}
