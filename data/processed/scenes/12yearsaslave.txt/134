<A>__{we are beyond the main of the plantation, the cotton field in the background. we are at the slaves' cemetery, a mixture of crude crosses and unsettled ground. solomon, bob and henry, now much visually older than when we first saw them, are digging a grave in the dirt. the uncovered body of abram lays near. having dug down an appropriate distance, the three men take the body and, very unceremoniously, place it into the ground. holdin the shovel in his hands, and resting it by his feet, bob tilts his head down and closes his eyes. the others do the same. almost stutteringly, not really knowing what to say }
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i just want to say something about uncle abram. he was a good man and he always looked out for us since we were little. god bless him. god love him. and god keep him.}
<A>__{that done, they begin to cover it with dirt. it is all the more of a funeral that abram will receive.}
