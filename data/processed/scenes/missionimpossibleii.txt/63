<P>__{(outraged)}
<D>__{what did you think you were doing!}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{i wasn't thinking! just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all.}
<A>__{this hits ethan with the force of a blow.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{ you who don't have a conscience.}
<C>__{nyah}
<P>__{(something of surprise to her)}
<D>__{i guess i lied..you can't get both of us out of here, can you?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{then you'll have to kill me before it's too late. before i start killing people.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{i'm infected with chimera. you know you don't have a choice. just do it now.}
<A>__{she puts ethan's gun to her forehead.}
<C>__{nyah }
<D>__{for god's sake, get it over with.}
<B>__{the hammer}
<A>__{pulls back. close ethan he can't fire, lower the hammer.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{we've got 19 hours and 57 minutes before you start killing anybody. i will get bellerophon into your system by then. just stay alive. i'm not gonna lose you.}
<A>__{ethan runs from the cover of the tanks toward the exploded wall once in the open, he exchanges direct gunfire with ambrose's team, wounding a couple men. he reaches the wall and dives thru, camera with him as he drops 25 stories, the sound of gunfire in the air all around him. less than a hundred feet from the ground a small dark chute deploys and ethan is lost from view beneath it. panning shot paintings (interior cultural artifact center) of aborigine paintings, eerie patterns made of man and nature phantasmagorical, like the patterns that form under the eyelids shortly before sleep. b.g. the haunting notes of didgeridoo insure they're not being overheard.}

<A>__{swanbeck breaks off and turns to a somewhat battered and battle weary ethan:}
<C>__{swanbeck }
<D>__{ since it appears that chimera, the mother of all nightmares is on the loose somewhere around here is there any way this disaster can be viewed as a qualified one?}
<C>__{ethan}
<P>__{(tight lipped)}
<D>__{not yet. we did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{we could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable. no deposits, no withdrawals. therefore no suspects.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{we think we've got our finger on the buyer.}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{do you? even assuming you're able to prevent ambrose selling chimera, you've now got an additional problem. you destroyed all of chimera at biocyte. if ambrose is going to sell chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of miss hall's blood to market.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{yes, i believe that's right.}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{but that leaves another seven or eight pints of chimera.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{you mean that leaves miss hall.}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{yes, i believe that's right. now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure, the victim becomes infectious. highly infectious.}
<A>__{ethan glances at his chronometer. swanbeck sees it.}
<C>__{swanbeck }
<D>__{you noted the time of exposure?}
<A>__{ethan nods.}
<C>__{swanbeck }
<D>__{ good. then if you manage to get hold of ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've got }
<P>__{(glancing at the chronometer)}
<D>__{ 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of chimera on earth.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{she sacrificed herself..}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{brave girl. if you can get hold of bellerophon with the time limit, you may spare her the ultimate sacrifice. but in either case you've got less than nine hours to kill her or cure her. after that it's out of our hands and a matter of worldwide material law. and hunt. however you obtain it, we want you to preserve a sample of chimera. bring it back alive.}
<A>__{ethan's staring at swanbeck.}
<C>__{swanbeck }
<D>__{something else?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{aren't you even curious? about why she did it?}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{no. i can't afford to be curious. and neither can you, hunt..}
<A>__{as the eerie wail of the didgeridoo seems to mount in volume and intensity, the overcast sky filtering into the loft seems particularly oppressive. ethan's up against it and he knows it.}
<B>__{a view of sydney}
<A>__{from harbors to skyline in all its sunlight splendor. nyah sits for a moment, looking steadily at ambrose. ambrose pats the cannister he's carrying.}
<C>__{ambrose}
<D>__{feel like pleading for your life?}
<C>__{nyah}
<P>__{(with an edge)}
<D>__{not as much as you feel like hearing it.}
<A>__{ambrose slaps her. with scarcely a flicker of hesitation she slaps him back.}
<C>__{ambrose}
<D>__{god damn it, nyah! why did you do it? why did you save that bastard?}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{if it'll make you feel any better i won't do it again.}
<A>__{it doesn't. full of pain and rage, he gets out of the car.}
<C>__{ambrose}
<D>__{if it'll make you feel any better, you're going to take a lot of aussies with you and make me a lot of money.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{ambrose}
<D>__{in just a few hours you can be assured of going down in history as the typhoid mary of oz. g'day.}
<A>__{a nameless guard from michael's car idling nearby gets into the back seat with nyah. ambrose shuts the car door in nyah's face, gets in michael's car takes off.}
