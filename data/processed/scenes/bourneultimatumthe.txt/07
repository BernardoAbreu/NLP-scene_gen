<C>__{kramer}
<D>__{pam, what i need to know is, what kind of a threat is he to us?}
<C>__{landy}
<D>__{if he just wanted to hurt us he could have sent this tape to cnn.}
<C>__{kramer}
<D>__{maybe he still will. maybe he gave it to you because he wants to throw you in the opposite direction of his real plan. i don't know. i just know my number one rule is "the only way to stay safe is to assume the worst." as far as i'm concerned bourne is a serious threat until proven otherwise.}
