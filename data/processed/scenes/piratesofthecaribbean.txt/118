<A>__{moonlight shines down into the shallow waters, brightening coral, sparkling over the rippled sand floor. suddenly all the fish scatter. briefly, the waters are empty. and then figures appear in the distance, seeming to waver in the shifting current. they scuffle forward, kicking up clouds of sand the figures resolve into the skeleton pirates, moving silently across the lagoon floor, swords glinting. the tatters of their clothing drift in the water. their skull heads are fixed in an endless grin. the lead pirate glides forward and stops next to a huge iron anchor twice his' height, even buried halfway into the sand. a heavy chain with barrel sized links climbs up toward the surface a shadow falls across the lead pirate he transforms, and we see that it is pintel. he looks up above, the heavy chain leads to the giant bottom hull of the h.m.s. dauntless, silhouetted by moonlight. the huge shift drifts, again spilling moonlight below and the pirates gathered around the anchor are once again skeletons, staring with upturned faces. the pintel skeleton puts a knife between his teeth, starts to crawl up the iron rings. other pirates crowd forward, and soon the anchor chain is clustered with skeletons }
