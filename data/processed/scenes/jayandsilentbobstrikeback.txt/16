<C>__{jay}
<D>__{there's one. on this side of it, we ain't gay.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{all hitchers do this. why do you think people pick us up? if you get a ride, it's expected i don't care who the driver is. it's the first rule in the book.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{what book?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{the unwritten book of the road.}
<A>__{a truck starts to pull over to the side of the road. the guy points to it, as if to say "see?" the passenger side door opens. the guy climbs into the truck and closes the door. he looks out the window at jay and bob.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{follow the rules of the book, and you'll get where you're going in no time. excuse me.}
<A>__{through the windshield, jay and silent bob see the guy go face first into the truck driver's lap. the truck drivers smiles, and the truck takes off, roaring down the road. jay and silent bob watch the truck disappear. then, a car pulls up. the nun driving rolls down the passenger side window and leans toward them.}
