<L>__{exterior freeway night}
<A>__{driving her own highly excellent car, natalie has it floored.}
<L>__{intercut}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{i'm ten minutes away. wait until i get there.}
<C>__{dylan}
<D>__{i can't do that. call alex and meet me here.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{dylan...}
<A>__{but dylan's already hung up. cursing her partner, natalie races the car even harder.}
<L>__{interior knox's living room night}
<A>__{knox is sitting at the coffee table, signing papers. vivian, sitting across from him, has her cell phone open. they are both surprised to see dylan walk into the room.}
<C>__{vivian wu}
<D>__{i see you take your bodyguarding services seriously. still, i worry that no one is watching the door.}
<C>__{dylan}
<P>__{(covering)}
<D>__{oh, i'm watching it. in fact, i just called for back up.}
<A>__{from her bag, vivian pulls a silver 9mm.}
<C>__{vivian wu}
<D>__{all the same, i'm concerned about mr. knox's safety.}
<A>__{charlie's angels 8 18 99 although knox is clueless, it's clear the message vivian is sending to dylan. she's in control here. vivian sets the gun on the table, in easy reach.}
<C>__{knox}
<P>__{(explaining)}
<D>__{vivian just came over to run through some numbers for the ipo.}
<C>__{vivian wu}
<D>__{please, take a seat. i'm almost finished.}
<A>__{with a knowing glance at dylan, she goes back to her phone call. no alternative, dylan takes a seat beside knox. both face vivian, whose hand is very near the gun. dylan looks at knox as he reads through his papers. he has no idea there's anything wrong.}
<C>__{vivian wu }
<P>__{(on phone)}
<D>__{really. how disappointing.}
<A>__{vivian gestures to the abandoned scrabble game on the table. why not play?}
<C>__{dylan}
<D>__{i'm not much for games.}
<C>__{vivian wu}
<D>__{pity.}
<A>__{as knox flips pages in the report, dylan casually begins pushing scrabble letters around, nothing serious. but she's managed to spell...}
<B>__{enemy}
<A>__{she gets knox's attention, looks to the word, up to vivian. knox follows her intention, but doesn't seem to believe it. while vivian continues to talk on the phone, knox sets his report down. pushes around some letters of his own. the words finally come out as...}
<B>__{i know}
<A>__{close on dylan. what does that mean? vivian snaps her phone shut. charlie's angels 8 18 99}
<C>__{vivian wu }
<P>__{(to knox)}
<D>__{bad news: the other angels are still alive. good news: everything else proceeding apace.}
<A>__{dylan stands up. what the hell is going on? vivian draws the gun on her. knox moves over toward vivian's side.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{sorry dylan. i knew this moment would come sooner or later. i was just hoping for later.}
<A>__{a long beat, dylan trying to wrap her head around this.}
<C>__{dylan}
<D>__{all this time, we thought red star was behind this, but it was you.}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{you faked your kidnapping.}
<A>__{knox taps his nose. she's got it.}
<C>__{dylan }
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{to gain your trust. and get your help.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i want you to know, my personal attraction to you was a sincere and unrelated complication.}
<C>__{dylan}
<D>__{oh, well, in that case i feel a lot better about you being a lying pole smoker.}
<A>__{dylan looks like she's about to leap forward and tear knox's throat out. vivian gestures for dylan to keep stepping back.}
<C>__{dylan }
<D>__{i can't believe i trusted you.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{why not? you trust charlie and you've never even met him.}
<A>__{dylan crosses the sill, out onto the balcony. charlie's angels 8 18 99}
<C>__{knox }
<D>__{and believe me, there's a lot about him that you don't know. anyway, i'm not going to be an idiot and stand here talking when we could do something useful, like kill you. goodbye, dylan, i will miss you...}
<A>__{how right he is, because as soon as vivian squeezes the trigger... dylan drops to the floor, then rolls. blam! the bullet misses dylan and slams into the bulletproof window causing a spider web crack to spread. dylan sees her opportunity and heads right for the window while vivian pumps off shots. as she comes to the window, dylan jumps up in the air and does a flying kick, hitting right at the spot where the bullet impacted. smash! the bulletproof glass shatters outward, and dylan flies out the window, onto the ledge.}
<C>__{knox }
<D>__{wow.}
<P>__{(to vivian)}
<D>__{i've never seen you do something like that.}
<C>__{vivian wu}
<D>__{oh, shut up.}
