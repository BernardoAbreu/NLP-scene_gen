<A>__{people line the top as the postman and briscoe ride out. the strains of "america" still in the background.}
<C>__{briscoe}
<D>__{you got a helluva nerve, whoever you are.}
<A>__{the postman doesn't rise to the bait.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{is abby around?}
<C>__{briscoe}
<D>__{she and michael are working the north meadow this morning.}
<A>__{briscoe reins up he's gone as far as his duty commands.}
<C>__{briscoe}
<D>__{well, you're on your own.}
<A>__{the postman tips his cap and continues riding by "pine view population 132." briscoe watches a moment, then calls after him:}
<C>__{briscoe}
<D>__{hey! are you really who you say you are?}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{if i come back with some mail, you'll know!}
<A>__{the postman continues. caught in an inner turmoil, briscoe reaches into his pocket, and pulls out a letter. he turns it over in his hands, looks off at the postman.}
<C>__{briscoe}
<D>__{god damn it!}
<A>__{briscoe urges his horse forward, catches up. he hands the postman the letter, then rides back for town. the postman watches briscoe. the people lining the wall. and he realizes just what effect he's had. there's nothing to do, but shrug his shoulders and ride. strains of "america" still echo hauntingly over:}
