<A>__{two waiters are fussing over hunsecker's table at which places are already set for sidney and hunsecker. matre d' hands him an envelope as he passes.}
<C>__{matre d'}
<D>__{mr. hunsecker this was to be delivered to you personally }
<A>__{when the columnist comes up to the table, the waiters quickly pull out the table for him. sidney comes to join him; sidney gets some attention, but considerably less.}
<B>__{camera moves closer.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{these drinks are warm.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{you said you like to have them on your table.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{what are you a critic?}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{i will change }
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{forget it.}
<P>__{(to sidney)}
<D>__{the real money ball is the boy...}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{yeah, the boy...we're on the verge of a farce, a real farce. as i see it, if susie had stood behind him today he might have proved a threat. but since primarily he's wedded to his work, he's not going to be able to take it.}
<A>__{a waiter shifts the position of the salad dish at hunsecker's elbow.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{(to waiter)}
<D>__{stop tinkering, pal that horse radish won't jump a fence!}
<A>__{the waiter retreats rapidly.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{in brief, j.j., it's all over because any hour now the boy will give her up. is it a farce or not?}
<A>__{delicately salting his oysters, hunsecker looks obliquely at sidney.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{this syrup you're giving out, sidney, you pour over waffles, not j.j. hunsecker! what do you mean that lousy kid will give up my sister?}
<A>__{hunsecker, with a casual gesture, tugs lightly at the end of sidney's tie. hunsecker's gesture is playful, but it inflicts great injury to sidney's dignity; sidney cannot bear to be touched; he finds this liberty on j.j.'s part as intolerable as anything he has experienced, and only with great difficulty controls himself. the shot favors sidney.}
<B>__{sidney and hunsecker}
<A>__{hunsecker continues:}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{are you listening?}

<A>__{sidney senses a warning in hunsecker's manner. he protests:}
<C>__{sidney}

<D>__{for the next sailing of the mary. susan's run down she's never been abroad and as you so cogently put it, i'm not made of iron.}
<A>__{sidney slowly pushes the envelope back to hunsecker, who leaves it lying on the table before him.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{that's good. now that louse is outa susie's hair for good.}
<B>__{sidney}
<A>__{he has an instinct to laugh; but something tells him not to.}
<B>__{hunsecker}
<A>__{as sidney makes no response, hunsecker slowly, carefully continues in a voice which is dangerously soft:}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{i want that boy taken apart.}
<B>__{sidney and hunsecker}
<A>__{shooting across hunsecker onto sidney. sidney puts down his fork. he sees now that the issue is serious and must be faced.}
<C>__{sidney}

<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{(interjecting quietly)}
<D>__{she knows now.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{why give her real proof? you nearly ruined her with her first husband and you were right, j.j., but she almost followed him out the window. what do you want a chronic invalid?}
<B>__{hunsecker}
<A>__{he wants no advice from sidney. he interrupts with quiet savagery.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{i know how to handle susie. you just handle the boy, sidney...}
<P>__{(scribbles on scratch pad)}
<D>__{...preferably tonight.}

<A>__{camera moves closer as sidney picks scratch pad up. we can read two words: "get kello".}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{i think i will go home maybe i left my sense of humor in another suit.}
<B>__{hunsecker}
<A>__{hunsecker finishes eating. during the ensuing speech, which he begins quietly and sensibly, hunsecker's venomous feelings are unexpectedly betrayed.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{you've got that god given brain learn to use it! do you think it's a personal matter with me, this boy? are you telling me i see things in terms of personal pique? don't you see that today that boy wiped his feet on the choice, on the predilections of sixty million men and women of the greatest country in the world! if you had any morals yourself, you would understand the immorality of that boy's stand today! it was not me he criticized it was my readers!...}
<A>__{camera pulls back to include sidney. hunsecker manages to control himself; he reaches with nervous fingers toward his scribbling pad.}
<B>__{sidney}
<A>__{sidney's face has tightened. he has begun now to realize the extent of this man's megalomania. after a moment he says:}

<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{j.j., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...i'd rather have my freedom.}

<B>__{sidney}
<A>__{a close up. he knows the truth of what is said. but he takes refuge in quiet retaliation:}

<B>__{sidney}
<A>__{we see that an idea has entered his head an idea that takes the wind out of his indignation. his eyes lift rapidly to hunsecker's face.}
