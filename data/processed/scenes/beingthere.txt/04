<L>__{interior potting room afternoon}
<A>__{the potting room is filled with the tools of the gardener, everything arranged in an orderly fashion. rows of small pots are on tables, young plants sprouting from some of them. a small, 1940's table model black and white tv rests on a shelf. it is playing, tuned to the boston pops orchestra. attached to the front of the screen is a wheel containing colored gels. the wheels spins, creates an early form of color tv. as chance enters, his attention is on the television set. he watches it as he oils the tines of the pitchfork and puts it away. chance turns off the tv and leaves the room, but the sound of the boston pops continues.}
