<L>__{interior nick's living room}
<A>__{sid has covered the floor and remaining furniture with drop cloths and is applying even strokes to the ceiling with a long handled roller. nick steps in and stares at sid and his own nearly empty drop cloth covered home.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(at the top of his lungs)}
<D>__{this really bothers me!}
<A>__{sid stares at him.}
<C>__{sid}
<P>__{(after a moment, with mock politeness)}
<D>__{will you do me a favor?}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(spitting out the word)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{act normal.}
<A>__{nick advances on sid.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(adamantly)}
<D>__{listen! i don't want to be normal. i don't have to be, i don't! this is my house. you're in my house. and i'm tired of going to my house and finding strangers!}
<A>__{they're face to face in a stand off.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{it's not your house. you're gone. i'm painting }
<A>__{he puts the long handled roller right in nick's face.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{ for the new people whose house it's going to be.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you're gone. they're not here yet. i'm here.}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{i guess that makes this my house.}
<A>__{nick ponders this logic, sid's size, and the roller in his face.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(politely)}
<D>__{may i look around?}
<C>__{sid}
<P>__{(w a stony politeness)}
<D>__{sure. make yourself at home.}
<A>__{nick wanders around the nearly empty room, then, after a beat... ...he pulls a dropcloth off an object in the corner, revealing the television.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(dismayed)}
<D>__{nooo... she left the television.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{too bad.}
<C>__{sid}
<P>__{(pointedly)}
<D>__{she didn't seem to want it.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{that's foolish. that t.v. is a remarkable thing.}
<A>__{they both stare at the television. the sweep of headlights turning into the driveway cross their faces. they both race to the door.}
