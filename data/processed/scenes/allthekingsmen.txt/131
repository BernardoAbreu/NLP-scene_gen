<A>__{jack's car is seen coming across on the ferry.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(voice over)}
<D>__{i kept saying to myself that willie was wrong about the judge. if there was anything left at burden's landing, it was honor. i had to believe that.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior stanton living room, night}
<A>__{jack and anne stand together in the living room.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{anne, i want to ask you a question. was the judge ever broke? really broke?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{why do you want to know?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i don't want to know, but i've got to.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{did he tell you }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{did who tell me?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{i don't know. i... how should i know if the judge was ever broke?}
<A>__{she walks away from him. adam enters, carrying bundles of food and two wine bottles.}
<C>__{stanton}
<D>__{hello... come on, anne, take this food and start cooking. i'm hungry.}
<A>__{anne takes the grocery bundles. jack grabs the wine.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{me, i'm on the thirsty side. bring some glasses, anne, quick.}
<A>__{he joins adam, who has opened the piano.}
<C>__{stanton}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{it's been a long time since i played this thing. what do you say we wake up the ghosts, huh?}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(calling to anne)}
<D>__{another glass, anne, for a ghost.}
<C>__{stanton}
<P>__{(starting to play)}
<D>__{remember the last time i played this? you and anne were dancing?}
<A>__{anne returns with three glasses. jack grabs her around the waist and whirls her around.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{shall we dance?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{let's... let's have a drink first.}
<A>__{adam starts to pour the wine.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no, no... keep playing. anne and i want to hear this, don't we, anne?}
<P>__{(jack pours the wine)}
<D>__{adam... ghost... and me.}
<C>__{stanton}
<D>__{what shall we drink to?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{to the ghost?... to adam, to the director of the new medical center.}
<C>__{stanton}
<P>__{(bangs the piano keys)}
<D>__{don't you ever stop working for him?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{adam!}
<C>__{stanton}
<D>__{i came up here to get away...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm sorry, adam.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{well, i'm not. what's wrong with being the director of the new medical center?}
<C>__{stanton}
<D>__{nothing, except that i'm not going to take it.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{why? because your uncle resigned?}
<C>__{stanton}
<D>__{that's partly it. there are other things.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{what other things?}
<C>__{stanton}
<P>__{(looks at her)}
<D>__{you too?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{yes, me too.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{anne, if adam doesn't want to discuss it, let's not.}
<C>__{stanton}
<D>__{all right, let's discuss it.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{but calmly.}
<C>__{stanton}
<D>__{calmly. go ahead, jack. why do you think he wants me?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{because you're the best man for the job.}
<C>__{stanton}
<D>__{it could have nothing to do with my name being stanton?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it could have. let's grant that.}
<C>__{stanton}
<D>__{that's your answer.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no, it's not. if that were the only answer i wouldn't be with him any more. there's another side of it. i've learned something from him. you can't make an omelet without cracking eggs.}
<C>__{stanton}
<D>__{or heads.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{but at least a hospital will be built, and the sick will be cared for.}
<C>__{stanton}
<D>__{at what price?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{at any price.}
<C>__{stanton}
<D>__{do you really believe that, jack?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i really believe that stark wants to do good. you do too. it's a matter of method. many times out of evil comes good. well, pain is an evil. as a doctor you should know that.}
<C>__{stanton}
<D>__{pain is an evil; it is not evil. it is not evil in itself. stark is evil.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{the people of the state don't think so.}
<C>__{stanton}
<D>__{how would they know? the first thing he did was to take over the newspapers and the radio stations. why be so afraid of criticism? if stark is interested in doing good, he should also be interested in the truth. i don't see how you can separate the two. no, stark is not for me.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(upset)}
<D>__{no, stark is not for you. well, what is for you? pride. pride, that's all it is... foolish, stupid pride. all you've ever talked about is what you could do if... if somebody would tear down and build. all right, all right, somebody has, and he's given it to you. but he's not for you. no, he's not for you.}
<A>__{she throws down her glass and runs crying from the room. adam goes after her.}
<C>__{stanton}
<D>__{anne... anne...}
