<A>__{emmi, at the open door, has been listening. she's shocked, turns away to see steve, on the extension, chuckling, grinning from ear to ear.}

<L>__{interior waiting room day}
<A>__{david and furtwangler haven't moved. both are looking towards steve's office and emmi in the doorway. again the sound of steve's laugh. then emmi steps into the room, approaches furtwangler.}

<A>__{he gives her a wonderful smile. and, suddenly, steve stands in the doorway, smiling.}
<C>__{steve}

<P>__{(he sits, crosses his legs.)}
<D>__{tell me, herr dr. furtwangler, do you know hans hinkel?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{yes, a despicable human being. he was in the ministry of culture. his job was to get rid of jews in the arts.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{yup, that's him, that's the guy. you know what else the little creep did? he kept files, close on 250,000 files. and you know what's in those files?}

<D>__{i was warned.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{who warned you?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<P>__{(lowering his head)}
<D>__{goering. because hinkel was working for goebbels.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{what did goering say?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{he told me to be careful as one of goebbels' men was watching me. he read a report on me everything i said was quoted word by word.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{oh boy, you're gonna love this. take your time with this now. those files contain the details of every working artist in this country. those files are gonna tell us who joined the party, who informed and who was helpful.}
<A>__{furtwangler goes to the door. david opens it for him. furtwangler nods, then turns to emmi, bows to her and smiles. he goes.}
