<L>__{exterior brand's hatch press tent day}
<A>__{a crowded press room. in opposite corners of the room, james and niki are giving interviews to different press and tv journalists. stirling moss is talking to james...}
<C>__{stirling moss}
<D>__{...james, a few weeks ago, you were out of the running for this season completely, now you're right back in it. what's changed...?}
<A>__{screaming girls in the background, shouting "james, we love you." james stares across the room at niki...}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{a combination of factors, not all of which i'm prepared to discuss here. justice being done re: the disqualification in spain helps, and having my old car back of course...}
<A>__{in the other corner: niki is doing his interviews in german, (we see sub titles)...}
<C>__{journalist}
<D>__{mathematically in theory it's now possible for hunt to catch you. are you worried?}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{not at all. for him to catch me, he'd have to win all the remaining races, and i'd have to lose them. and pigs would have to fly.}
<A>__{laughter among the confident germans.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{now if you'll excuse me, i have a private family matter to attend to.}
<A>__{niki takes marlene's hand, and leads her away.}
