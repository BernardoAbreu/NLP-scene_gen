<L>__{interior carlos' car continuous}
<A>__{carlos's car is parked in street in front of carter's house, just down the street from where pedro has parked, but on the opposite side of the street and facing in the opposite direction. through the windshield, we see berubi head back toward the house as pedro glances at jessica, now showered and dressed in a yellow tank top, before climbing back into the tow truck and pulling back out onto the road. carlos has noticed pedro, but jessica, silent as she stares at the house, has not. finally, carlos speaks up.}

<A>__{jessica grabs the rear view mirror and aims it toward herself. she begins fixing her hair in the mirror. she pulls her lipstick out of her purse and begins to apply it as carlos watches. she puts her lipstick away and stares at carter's house another moment. she checks to see that her sunglasses are still hanging on the front of her shirt.}
