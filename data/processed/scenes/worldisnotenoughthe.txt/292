<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior submarine continuous}
<A>__{the gauge is passing 4900, edging towards the no way back}
<L>__{5000 mark. meltdown imminent...}
<A>__{he looks down the sub more water racing upward... back to the pile. scans the scene, searching for an idea. sees a hose, compressed air escaping from a fissure. thinks fast. grabs the hose, snaps it free...}
<B>__{renard}
<A>__{is recovering, has found a flare gun near him. raises it to bond... bond's pov in the reflection of the gauge (which is millimeters from}
<L>__{5000), we see renard approaching from behind us...}
<A>__{bond jams the hose into the reactor, ducks down as the air blows the rod out narrowly missing him as it shoots past impales renard in the heart, just before he could shoot. renard stares at bond in horror. bond calmly takes the flare gun off him.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{she's waiting for you.}
<A>__{and he lets him fall past christmas, through consecutive open hatches of the sub, crashing into the rising water. christmas looks down at the floating corpse. bond watches the gauge as it edges down from 5000. the nuclear disaster looks like it's averted. but suddenly water is gushing in from above, through splits in the sub's shell; it's going to sink.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{we're sinking.}
<A>__{but she won't come. as water courses over them:}
<C>__{christmas}
<D>__{help me. we have to seal it.}
<A>__{she moves to the reactor, closing the cover. bond uses his strength to push the heavy locking mechanism into place. bond climbs upwards, dragging christmas with him.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{we've got to get out.}
<C>__{christmas}
<D>__{we can't.}
