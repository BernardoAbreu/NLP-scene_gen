<L>__{exterior camp night}
<A>__{sarah and nick carry the screeching baby tyrannosaur in their arms, headed for the trailer. malcolm, holding his bleeding arm, isn't far behind.}
<L>__{interior trailer night}
<A>__{sarah and nick bring the screaming infant to the metal dining table and hold it down. malcolm is right behind them.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{this is exceedingly unwise.}
<A>__{sarah turns away from a drawer of medical supplies, holding a small syringe. her shirt is streaked with blood from the baby's injured leg.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{too late to worry about that! hold him together, nick!}
<A>__{nick tightens his grip on the animal and sarah makes an injection into its thigh, over its loudly voiced objections.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{just do whatever you have to do and get it out of here as quickly as possible.}
<A>__{sarah picks up a small ultrasound transducer and runs it over the animal's leg. a green and white skeletal image appears on a monitor next to the table.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{okay, there's the metatarsals tibia, fibula there it is! see it? that's a fracture, just above the epiphysis.}
<A>__{they peer closely at the monitor.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{that little black line?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{that little black line means death for this infant. the fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet. the baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk. it'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{can you set up?}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{it has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{think fast, sarah.}
<A>__{the tyrannosaur, still in pain, shrieks again.}
