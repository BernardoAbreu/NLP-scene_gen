<L>__{exterior elm street. night.}
<A>__{moving with nancy at full gallop, running blind. she crashes through a sawhorse into a new sidewalk, sinking into the wet cement over her ankles. the stuff sticks to her legs in long gluey globs and she can barely pull her feet loose. the killer looms nearby, mocking her his scalpel claws gleaming in the streetlight. he just misses the girl as she wrenches free and flees again, now so winded she can only stagger. moving with them. time after time nancy just barely manages to elude the shadowy form, leaping from his reach by inches and pouring on more steam. it's too close to even bother screaming now; and besides, that would take breath she doesn't have. the only sound is of running footsteps, rasping breath and the knife fingers whistling through the air.}
