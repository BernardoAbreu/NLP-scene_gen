<L>__{int poor house day}
<A>__{camera, tracks the gritty reality of a big city poor house, crammed with society's dregs: the poor, the uneducated, wailing babies, stampeding children. absolutely jangling with noise and confusion... loud and stifling... people getting eye ear nose throat exams... being vaccinated... the "doctors" in attendance are all ingolstadt students performing community service, none of whom look like they're enjoying it. schiller looks particularly harried. we find victor and henry giving out vaccinations. they keep glancing over their shoulders at waldman as he gets further embroiled in a no win argument with a wiry, ferret faced man terrified about getting his vaccination:}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{yer not stickin' it in me! got pox in it, i hear tell!}
<C>__{fat woman}
<D>__{pox? they givin' us pox?}
<A>__{ripples of panic spread. waldman is as tense and clipped as we've ever seen him, valiantly trying to control his temper amidst the surrounding cacophony and ad lib dialogue:}
<C>__{waldman}
<D>__{no, it's not pox, it's a vaccine...}
<C>__{fat woman}
<D>__{vaca what?}
<C>__{waldman}
<D>__{...vaccine, from the latin vacca, meaning cow}
<P>__{(glances at her girth)}
<D>__{...or vaccinia, meaning cowpox...}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{i told you there was pox in it!}
<C>__{waldman}
<D>__{...no, no, cowpox in a minute quantity, perfectly harmless, gives you a natural immunity to small ox, which is the point of this whole bloody exercise...}
<A>__{victor and henry are pausing work. concerned. drifting closer. the ferret faced man is cornered.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{you doctors kill people! i don' care what you say, you ain't stickin' it in me!}
<C>__{waldman}
<D>__{i most assuredly am! it prevents disease and it's the law! why am i explaining myself? somebody restrain this damn fool!}
<A>__{it happens this fast: there's an innocuous blur of motion as the man seems to tap waldman lightly in the stomach, then he darts away, slamming past victor and henry. victor looks after him running away, hears something clatter to the floor. he glances down. a thin knife. victor looks to waldman. puzzled. it still hasn't really dawned. waldman turns to them, face drained of color, hand pressed to his sternum, lips tight. he looks more annoyed than anything else. he exhales slowly.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{professor?}
<C>__{waldman}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{oh god.}
<A>__{that's when the blood starts pumping through his fingers. they catch him as he collapses, cradling him as he sprawls to the floor. people are pushing and crowding to see.}
