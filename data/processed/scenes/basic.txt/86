<T>__{pike turns to mueller:}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{cadet michael mueller, i hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of sergeant nathan west }
<C>__{mueller}
<D>__{the fuck are you talking about }
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{you are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard }
<C>__{mueller}
<D>__{bullshit }
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in sergeant west's body }
<C>__{mueller}
<D>__{shut up!}
<A>__{mueller pulls his sidearm and points it at pike.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{mueller, what the fuck }
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{don't do this }
<A>__{pike, eyes locked with mueller. continuing:}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{a test will no doubt link you to the killing }
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{put it down!}
<C>__{mueller}
<D>__{tell him to shut up }
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{ failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself }
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{pike, please }
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{although that won't matter much when coupled with the murder charge }
<C>__{mueller}
<D>__{shut the fuck up you fucking nigger }
<A>__{pike leans forward.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{you stupid white trash motherfucker, i saw you do it }
<A>__{and mueller fires. pike's head snaps back. the gunshot, deafening. then, for an eternity, silence. nobody moves. nobody breathes. as if time has stopped.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{oh.. . my god...}
<A>__{mueller lowers his arm, the pistol clattering to the floor. his face, as shocked as the others.}
<C>__{mueller}
<D>__{he wouldn't... stop talking...}
<A>__{he takes a step forward towards pike. a hole in the middle of the black man's forehead.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{so you killed him?}
<C>__{mueller}
<C>__{i. . .}
<A>__{almost mechanically, dunbar begins to reach for his own gun... the unmistakable sound of a two rifles' magazines being racked simultaneously. dunbar turns to see childs and nunez, their m 16's in hand. levelled at him.}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{get that hand away.}
<A>__{dunbar does. looks to nunez.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{you too?}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{we can still come out of this okay. pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. that's the story.}
<A>__{mueller collapses on the ground. head in hands.}
<C>__{mueller}
<D>__{west was one thing, but this }
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{shut up, mueller.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{you framed him...}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{none of that matters now. we got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. you're either with us, or against us which is it?}
<A>__{dunbar and kendall, looking at each other. it's clear what the wrong answer will mean. a long beat, until}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{okay }
<A>__{he is cut off as the wind outside roars the hurricane mounting to it's full force and the windows blow inwards, showering childs, mueller, and nunez with glass! dunbar's hand flies to his pistol, pulling it... mueller, screaming, trying to claw the glass from his eyes... childs, seeing dunbar move, pulls the trigger. .. . and the cabin is filled with the thunder of gunfire as kendall goes down, clutching his arm... dunbar fires, hitting childs directly in the chest... childs, still shooting, falls back, his random spray of bullets punching into mueller who jerks like a marionette... nunez, drawing a bead on dunbar, about to shoot, when... a great crescendo of wood splintering and supports buckling overtakes them and the cabin's roof comes down on their heads.}
