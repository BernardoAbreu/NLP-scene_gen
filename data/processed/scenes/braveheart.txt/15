<L>__{interior farmhouse dawn}
<A>__{william has been awake all night, afraid to sleep. he rises, and in quick cuts: he dresses; he moves down the hall, stops at the door of his father's bedroom and sees the undisturbed bed. he moves on, passing the door of his brother's room, also unrumpled.}
<B>__{in the kitchen}
<A>__{he finds the two cold bowls of stew, beside the exhausted candle. he spoons up his own cold porridge, and eats alone.}
