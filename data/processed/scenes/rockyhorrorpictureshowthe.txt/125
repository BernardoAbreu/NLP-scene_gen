<L>__{interior laboratory night}
<A>__{the laboratory is somewhere between a student observation operating theatre and a greek gymnasium. it is pink tiled throughout, facing the lift entrance is a circular area containing a tank on pedestals which though screened at this stage will be revealed to contain the body of rocky submerged in chemicals, the wall to one side contains a raised dias area for the guests, and facing one end of the tank, the operational controls, monitor and a giant refrigerator. a chandelier hangs above the tank. on the podium in front of frank's chambers there is a stand microphone. near the podium are some weights. behind the tank is a vaulting horse. these are wrapped in sellophane rocky's presents. the guests are waiting as the lift arrives. frank, now in surgeon's outfit stands in the middle of the room. riff raff gets out of the lift first, with a glass of champagne which he hands to frank.}

<A>__{magenta & columbia cross to the podium.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{it's not often we receive visitors here. let alone offer them hospitality.}

<C>__{janet }
<D>__{don't be ungrateful brad.}
<C>__{brad }
<D>__{ungrateful!}
<A>__{the room falls silent. all eyes are on frank, waiting for his reaction. a smile breaks on his face.}

<C>__{frank}
<D>__{and paradise is to be mine.}
<A>__{guests and everybody applaud. janet claps too, but brad indicates that she shouldn't.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it was strange the way it happened. one of those quirks of fate really. one of those moments when you seem irredeemably lost: you panic; you're trapped; your back's against the wall. there's no way out, and then suddenly, you get a break. (he cracks the bones in his hand) all the pieces seem to fit into place. what a sucker you'r been. what a fool. the answer was there all the time. it took a small accident to make it happen. an accident!}
<A>__{magenta & columbia step forward one each side of him.}
<P>__{magenta & columbia (softly)}
<D>__{an accident.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{that's how i discovered the secret. that elusive ingredient, that spark that is the breath of life.}
