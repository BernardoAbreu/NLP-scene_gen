<A>__{brendan walks away from the lot, towards the school. laura pulls up beside him in her car.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{brendan ignores her and b lines for the school. laura brakes hard, parking by the curb.}
<L>__{exterior school hallway continuous}
<A>__{brendan limps down the hallway. laura appears behind him, trotting to catch up.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{you're quite a pill.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{home.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{why did you take a powder the other night?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{same reason i'm taking one now.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{hold it.}
<P>__{(he keeps walking)}
<D>__{i don't get you. that's a chilly heel to be giving a girl who's where you want to know about.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{i will get where i'm going just fine.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i want to help you.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{go away.}
<A>__{silence behind him. he stops, turns wearily. she looks genuinely hurt.}
<D>__{brendan (cont'd) (cont'd) look, i can't trust you. you ought to be smart enough to know that. i didn't shake the party up to get your attention, and i'm not heeling you to hook you. your connections could help me, but the bad baggage they bring could make it zero sum game or even hurt me, so i'm better off coming at it clean.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i wouldn't have to lead you in by the hand }
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{i can't trust you. brad was a sap, you weren't, you were with him and so you were playing him, so you're a player. with you behind me i'd have to tie one eye up watching both your hands, and i can't spare it.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{you're not brad.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{no, i'm not.}
<A>__{he turns and walks away. she doesn't follow.}
