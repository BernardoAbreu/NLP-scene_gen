<A>__{in darkness, a blood curdling cacophony: the squeal of unoiled winches, the rasp of hooks and razors being sharpened; and worse, the howl of tormented souls. above this din one particular victim yells for mercy a mixture of tears and roars of rage. by degrees his incoherent pleas are drowned out by the surrounding tumult, until without warning his voice pierces the confusion afresh this time reduced to naked scream. and with the sound, an image. a house: number 55, lodovico street, an old, three storey, late victorian house, with gaunt trees lining its overgrown garden. its curtains are drawn, there is newspaper over its top window. the titles begin to run, as we approach the house down the driveway. we move inside, to the hallway. the cries are louder now. room by room, we explore the empty house, while the titles continue to run. it has been left empty for many years, though much of its furniture remains, covered in dust sheets. on the mantelpiece of one room, a plaster sainterior in the kitchen, evidence of life here. opened tins; bread; bottles of spirits; a glass. we move upstairs, gliding along the corridor of the lower landing. the din is furious now. on the floor of one room, a makeshift bed: blankets strewn; an open suitcase; more liquor. we move up a flight and approach a room off the upper landing, the door of which is ajar. the light within swings backwards and forwards, spilling into the passageway. as we reach the door, the screams from within halt abruptly. we can hear a bell now, which has been pealing steadily throughout this opening sequence. as we move through the door, the titles end.}
