<B>__{operating theatre}
<A>__{the night porter is adding fresh coal to the operating room stove. the old coals were still quite hot and now smoke begins to rise. the night porter takes up the bellows and begins to pump the coals into a blaze. the door bangs open and treves is there, standing stock still, in a cold murderous rage.}

<D>__{where is he?}
<A>__{the night porter, frightened by treves' intensity, begins to sputter.}

<D>__{don't lie to me. i know all about it. you were seen. where did you take him?}
<C>__{night porter}
<D>__{take him? now wait... i didn't take him anywhere. we were just having some fun. we didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{he's gone!}
<C>__{night porter}
<D>__{when i left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.}

<D>__{you're the monster! you're the freak! get out! you're finished!}
<A>__{treves takes the night porter by the arm and begins to drag him out. the night porter throws his hand off violently, whirls around, his back to the door, and seizes the poker from the stove.}
<C>__{night porter}
<D>__{have a care, mr. treves. i ain't afraid of you! you and your bleedin' elephant man! i'm glad what i did! and you can't do nothing! only mothershead can sack me.}
<A>__{treves, blind with fury, tears the poker from the night porter's hand, and is on the verge of using it. unbeknownst to them, mothershead has storm into the room, just in time to hear the last of the night porter's speech. without a break, she strides over to him and with a lightning movement, boxes him soundly on the ears. the blow is staggering and makes quite a formidable sound. the night porter falls to the floor, barely conscious.}
<C>__{mothershead}
<D>__{done.}
<A>__{outside the shop (day) treves is standing in the street looking at the now bare shop front. he walks to the window and tries to clean a small circle in the glass. he peers in. from inside, through the smeared dirty window, we see treves' distorted face.}
<C>__{carr }
<D>__{i'd like to think i felt no less for john than you, treves, but face the facts, the man has disappeared, very likely to the continent. there's no question of your going after him, you're desperately needed here by your patients. remember treves, you did everything in your power... everything in your power.}
