<L>__{exterior barge night}
<A>__{evelyn sits on a table, staring out over the passing river. the gunny sack drops onto the table, startling her.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{the only thing that scares me, mister o'connell, are your manners.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{still angry that i kissed ya, huh?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{if you call that a kiss.}
<A>__{o'connell reaches into the gunny sack and starts pulling out revolvers, pistols, hunting knives, a massive elephant gun, and a half dozen carefully wrapped sticks of dynamite.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{did i miss something? are we going into battle?}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{the last time i was at that place everybody i was with died.}
<A>__{this takes the smile off evelyn's face. o'connell starts dismantling and cleaning the guns.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{there's something out there, you know, something under that sand.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{yes, i'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. what do you think is out there?}
<A>__{o'connell looks into evelyn's eyes.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{evil. the tuaregs and the bedouin believe that hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell."}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{ahmar is ossirion. "passageway to the underworld", actually.}
<A>__{she gives him a know it all grin.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{i don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, mister o'connell, but i do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, the book of the living. it's what first interested me in egypt as a child. it's why i came here, sort of a life's pursuit.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{and the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right?}
<A>__{evelyn is surprised by his knowledge.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{you know your history.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{i know my treasure.}
<A>__{evelyn gets up to go, then she hesitates, nervous, she turns back to o'connell, and as matter of fact as possible says:}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{by the way,... why did you kiss me?}
<A>__{o'connell, cleaning his guns, just shrugs his shoulders.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{i was about to be hanged, seemed like a good idea at the time.}
<A>__{evelyn's eyes widen, furious, she turns and storms off. o'connell looks up, watching her leave, a bit perplexed.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{what?... wha'd i say?}
<A>__{then he hears someone snickering under the table. he quickly reaches down, grabs that someone and lifts him up. it's beni.}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{my very good friend! what a surprise.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{why if it ain't my little buddy, beni. i oughta kill you.}
<A>__{o'connell sticks a knife under beni's throat. beni swallows hard, then tries to weasel his way out with a big grin.}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{you never were any good with the ladies, o'connell.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{so you're the one leading the americans, i shoulda figured. so what's the scam? you get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{unfortunately no, these americans are smart, they pay me only half now, half when i get them back to cairo, so i must go all the way.}
<A>__{o'connell pulls the knife away. beni relaxes, rubs his neck.}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{you never believed in hamunaptra, o'connell. why are you going back? the devil himself lives out there.}
<A>__{they look as they hear evelyn yelp. a single camel in the horse paddock takes another bite at her. she yelps again and backs away. o'connell grins as evelyn flees down the deck.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{the girl saved my life, figured it was the least i could do, keep her out of trouble.}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{you always did have more balls than brains.}
<A>__{o'connell's eyes narrow at the insult, he looks back at beni.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{let's make us even, shall we?}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{even?}
<A>__{o'connell grabs him and chucks him over the side of the barge. beni splashes into the river. o'connell takes his gunny sack and starts walking off down the deck.}
<C>__{beni }
<D>__{o'connell! i am going to kill you for this!}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{sounds familiar.}
<A>__{and that's when he spots three sets of wet footprints, coming up over the railing from the river and heading down the deck. o'connell quickly looks around, immediately on the alert.}
