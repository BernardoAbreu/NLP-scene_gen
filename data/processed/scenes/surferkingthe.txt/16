<L>__{ext moments later day the wave area}
<A>__{the walk up to the wave attraction, where kids are surfing in a high water pressure river sheet of water. surf music plays loudly here, and kids are doing all kinds of tricks. some riders are good, some are not, and fall quickly. we also see skeeter and snitch, the tall skinny and short chubby grounds kids we met earlier. they are cleaning up around the exit area of the wave.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(as a rider falls)}
<D>__{it's a lot harder than it looks.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{i can't imagine it's that difficult.}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{...no rudder on the board...}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{now this is a place of many wonders. see those guys in line over there?}
<A>__{we see some guys that look a little stoned with unusual hair laughing and talking to each other.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{we call them "wave bums". they all have season passes, and do little more than ride the wave all day long. some of them get pretty good.}
<A>__{alex points up to a fence, behind which some smoke appears to be drifting up.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{that's where they hang out when they're not riding the wave. don't get too close to them.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{no?}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(sniffing)}
<D>__{contact high.}
<A>__{robbie nods, understanding. alex points back to the wave.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{and there, my friend, is another one of the wave's features.}
<A>__{we see a pretty girl in line to ride.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{we call them "wave babes". and there's a special secret to this ride.}
<A>__{with that alex walks over to bob, a guy in his late teens, wearing a security golf shirt. he is standing and looking off in a different direction.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{hey, bob....can i borrow your radio a minute?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{he hands him the radio, and alex is back with robbie.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(into radio)}
<D>__{hey frank, it's alex.}
<A>__{alex waves and frank, the guard watching the wave waves back.}
<C>__{frank vo}
<P>__{(heard through the radio)}
<D>__{yo, alex.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(into radio)}
<D>__{listen you have a possible code 4.}
<P>__{(to robbie)}
<D>__{means a "hottie".}
<C>__{alex }
<P>__{(to radio)}
<D>__{she's up nexterior a free chicken sandwich and a smoothie if you bounce up the pressure a bit.}
<C>__{frank vo}
<P>__{(heard through radio)}
<D>__{you got it bud. but two smoothies. "volcanos".}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(to robbie)}
<D>__{he knows my weak spot.}
<P>__{(to radio)}
<D>__{two volcanos and a chicken sandwich.}
<C>__{frank vo}
<P>__{(heard through radio)}
<D>__{time to go to ludicrous speed!}
<A>__{we see frank push forward on a handle next to him that seems to resemble the throttle on a speedboat. the ambient noise from the wave is noticeably higher. the wave babe jumps into the water with the board. skeeter and snitch are still cleaning near the exit.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(to robbie, still holding the radio)}
<D>__{watch, and wait....}
<A>__{they look intently at the wave babe, who is pretty good, even with the increased water flow. but, after a few deft moves, she falls. alex looks, and sees what he is looking for. robbie smiles.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{yesss!}
<A>__{we look back at the wave babe, but the water is obscuring our view. we then see a medium shot of skeeter and snitch. the wave babe walks past them carrying a board, but we don't see below her waist, the board obscures our view. snitch sees, and freezes, dumbstruck. skeeter is looking down at the grate where the wave water drains. he reaches down and pulls something out, and turns to the wave babe walking away.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<P>__{(unaffected)}
<D>__{excuse me... miss?}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{hello...excuse me...?}
<A>__{finally she turns. we see her, but just a flash of her from the back, as the board covers her waist area. she is puzzled by this grounds kid.}
<C>__{skeeter }
<P>__{(holding up the bottom to her swimsuit)}
<D>__{is this yours?}
<A>__{she looks down behind the board and reacts. she bites her lower lip, winces and nods yes. skeeter hands her her swimsuit, and she looks around and backs away towards a towel hanging from the fence nearby. snitch is still frozen, stunned by what he's just seen, mouth wide open. skeeter waves his hand in front of snitch's face. no reaction. he's never seen a naked girl before. we're back to alex and robbie.}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(looking at alex)}
<D>__{you were right. i was interested in this.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{well, sometime bring your swimsuit. we'll come back on break. i will show you how to do it. surf's is this way. and keep an eye out for frank over there. we owe him.}
<A>__{robbie nods in agreement, and they walk off.}
