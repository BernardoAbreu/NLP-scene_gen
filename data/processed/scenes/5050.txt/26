<L>__{interior bus evening}
<A>__{adam sits deep in thought.}
<L>__{exterior adam's house same time}
<A>__{the bus stops. adam gets off, walks to his house, and takes a deep breath...}
<L>__{interior adam's house. living room continuous}
<A>__{adam enters the living room it's empty. npr news is on the radio. fresh paint dries on a canvas resting on an easel. the sound of someone cooking comes from the kitchen.}
<C>__{rachel }
<D>__{adam? is that you?}
<A>__{adam walks into the kitchen. rachel is at the stove cooking in her underwear. adam stands in the doorway watching her. god she looks sexy. rachel turns }
<C>__{rachel }
<P>__{(in a hungarian accent)}
<D>__{welcome home mr. adam. i made vegetarian goulash.}
<A>__{like a ballerina, rachel crosses to adam on her tip toes holding out a spoon of her goulash. she holds up the offering to adam's mouth. he takes a small bite and smiles, trying to hide his internal distress. his sad eyes tell rachel another story.}
<C>__{rachel }
<P>__{(still using accent)}
<D>__{what is wrong?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(still using accent)}
<D>__{liar.}
<A>__{this is not going to be easy.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{we need to talk.}
<A>__{rachel drops the accent. this seems serious.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{why? what's going on?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i had a doctor's appointment today.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{what kind of doctor's appointment?}
<A>__{adam has no idea what to say.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{have you ever seen the movie "beaches"?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you mean with bette midler?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{yeah that one.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{not as good as "the rose", but good.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{remember the end of "beaches"?}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{yeah. sad....what does that have to do with you?}
<A>__{adam just looks her in the eyes...rachel gets it.}
<C>__{rachel }
<D>__{oh. oh my god.}
<A>__{in total shock, rachel covers her mouth.}
<C>__{rachel }
<D>__{what kind?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you don't know?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{well i do know, but i can't pronounce it. neuroscharnoma or something.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{well how bad is it?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{it's not good.}
<A>__{rachel hugs adam. soaking in the comfort, adam rests his head on her shoulder. she gently strokes his hair. adam's hand slowly moves down rachel's back. he starts kissing her neck. he knows it's wrong, but can't help it, the only thing running through his mind is sex. after a beat rachel pulls away.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(begins to cry)}
<D>__{you have cancer.}
<A>__{heart racing, rachel opens the top pantry. she reaches back as far as she can and pulls out a cookie jar. she sticks her hand in the jar and pulls out an old pack of american spirits. adam looks at rachel disapprovingly.}
<C>__{rachel }
<D>__{not now.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i just think it's an interesting time to take up smoking again.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{adam i'm 24 years old!}
<P>__{(catches herself)}
<D>__{you're25.}
<A>__{rachel puts one of the cigarettes to her mouth, lights it on the stove and takes a drag.}
<C>__{rachel }
<D>__{what are we going to do? i don't know what to do.}
<A>__{rachel begins compulsively pulling drags from the cigarette. adam takes the cigarette out of her hand. he goes to put it out, but takes a drag instead. he then hugs rachel with one hand and opens the window with the other; he proceeds to discreetly fan out the cigarette smoke.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{sshhhh. everything's going to be alright yammy. i'm going to start chemo in a few days.}
<P>__{(positive)}
<D>__{we're going to get through this.}
<A>__{they embrace in total silence...a beat. and then adam groans with the realization }
<C>__{adam }
<D>__{ugh...and my parents are coming over for dinner.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{do they know?}
<A>__{adam is clearly not in the mood to see his parents.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{pre lap: the sound of a doorbell...}
