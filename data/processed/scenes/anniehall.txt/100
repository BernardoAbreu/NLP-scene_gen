<A>__{annie, singing "seems like old times, " overlaps alvy's speech and continues over the next scene, where alvy, standing in front of a manhattan theater, shakes hands with annie and her escort. the theater marquee reads "ophuls prize film: 'the sorrow and the pity'."}

<D>__{... we had lunch sometime after that, and, uh, just, uh, kicked around old times.}
<A>__{a series of flashbacks following in quick succession while annie continues to sing: annie and alvy going up the fdr drive, the day they met playing tennis, annie driving, alvy bolding up partially eaten sandwich. annie and alvy in the hamptons house kitchen, annie banding a live lobster to alvy, who drops it in the pot on the stove. annie and alvy walking side by side by the shoreline. alvy at the tennis club, packing his bag, as he looks over his shoulder and sees annie, hands on her face, then clapping, as she offers him a ride home in her car. annie opening the door to alvy the night he came over to kill the spider; annie and, alvy in the bookstore buying the "death" titles; annie and, alvy in their hamptons house, annie reading a school catalogue, the night alvy puts in the red light. the memories continue to flash on the screen: annie and alvy at a friend's house, alvy blowing the cocaine all over the sofa; annie and alvy playing tennis; annie and alvy having a picture taken backstage at the college performance in annie's hometown; alvy bolding annie close, the night he came over to kill the spider. and continue: annie carrying her luggage and clothes into alvy's bedroom, alvy following, the day she first moved into his apartment. annie holding up her sexy birthday present from alvy, then leaning over and kissing him; annie and alvy walking down a city street, holding each other close; sitting on the park bench, observing the people; and kissing, on the fdr drive, the new york city skyline behind them. the music stops. returning to the present, the camera, focusing through the cafe window, shows annie and alvy across street. they look about at the city traffic. lunch is over; it's time. alvy and annie shake hands and kiss each other friendly like. annie crosses the street, alvy watching her go. then he turns, and slowly walks down the street off screen. his voice is heard over the scene:}
<D>__{alvy's voice over after that it got pretty late. and we both hadda go, but it was great seeing annie again, right? i realized what a terrific person she was and and how much fun it was just knowing her and i i thought of that old joke, you know, this this this guy goes to a psychiatrist and says, "doc, uh, my brother's crazy. he thinks he's a chicken." and, uh, the doctor says, "well, why don't you turn him in?" and the guy says, "i would, but i need the eggs." well, i guess that's pretty much how how i feet about relationships. you know, they're totally irrational and crazy and absurd and ... but, uh, i guess we keep goin' through it because, uh, most of us need the eggs.}
