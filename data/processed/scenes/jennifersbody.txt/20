<L>__{exterior the carousel continuous}
<A>__{jennifer collapses in needy's arms, coughing. needy hugs her fiercely, almost romantically. she cups jennifer's flushed face and looks into her eyes.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(dazed)}
<D>__{it's so hot, needy. i think i'm on fire. oh god, i'm burning!}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{you're okay, i promise. you got burned worse when you wore that tin foil bikini to the beach. everything's fine.}
<A>__{suddenly, a hand clamps onto jennifer's shoulder. both girls jump. it's nikolai, his forehead creased with false concern.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{are you girls all right?}
<A>__{needy is less than thrilled to see him.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{we're great. maybe you should try to find your band?}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{those guys? they were the first ones out the door. ran for the van like a bunch of marys. frankly, i'm ashamed of them.}
<A>__{needy narrows her eyes suspiciously. muffled screams rise up from the flame engulfed building. jennifer covers her ears and cowers, sweat rolling down her face.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{god, it feels like hell out here. come and hang with us in the van for a while, just until they hose this place down.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{okay...okay...}
<A>__{she slumps against nikolai's chest.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{you're in shock. here, drink this. you'll feel better.}
<A>__{he smoothly retrieves a plastic bottle of peach schnapps from his coat and holds it to jennifer's lips. she swigs it cooperatively, dribbling down her chin. needy blinks in disbelief at the coincidence.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{aren't you a little freaked out about this? what about all your stuff? it's probably melting, and when you get to the next stop you'll have to do like, a crappy acoustic set! nobody likes that.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{we'll be able to afford new gear soon enough. i have a feeling we're gonna blow up.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(slurring)}
<D>__{i want to see your van. c'mon needy, let's go to the van.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{why? why should we? we have the malibu. let's just get out of here. we can go to el ojo and get northwoods nachos with extra badger sauce! please? i'm starving.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{needy, stop it. just stop it!}
<A>__{she defiantly follows nikolai toward the white van, which is parked a suspiciously safe distance from the bar. needy staggers after them slowly, watching. behind needy, the bar explodes. screams. flames. silence. needy doesn't even look back as she watches jennifer get into the van. ash drifts into her hair like snowflakes. nikolai takes off his shirt as he enters the van, revealing his slick, muscled white torso.}
<C>__{needy v.o.}
<D>__{i watched her get into that van and i knew something awful was going to happen. but for some reason, i felt drawn toward them. toward him. he was pale and twisted and evil, like this petrified tree i saw when i was a kid.}
