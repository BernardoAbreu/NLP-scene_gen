<L>__{interior brian's apartment living room night}
<A>__{a funky apartment on the upper west side. nick and lexi are both asleep in sleeping bags on top of a futon on the floor, their suitcases nearby. brian tiptoes past them, carrying two glasses of champagne. he knocks on his office door.}
<C>__{roberta }
<D>__{come in.}
<L>__{interior brian's apartment office continuous}
<A>__{roberta's in a bathrobe and nightgown, some rollers in her hair. she's tidying up her suitcase, etc., next to an old couch that's been made up as a bed. leftist political books line a shelf above brian's desk, including copies of his own, to hell and back: interviews with vietnam vets by brian turner. his desk is covered with files and books pertaining to migrant workers. brian enters.}

<C>__{brian}
<D>__{there's no rush.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{no, we've put you out enough. you're supposed to be writing, not babysitting for us.}

<P>__{vietnam book)}
<D>__{i've started your book. it's very powerful.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{brian comes up behind her and starts to kiss her neck. roberta's scared so she keeps talking, as if it's not really happening.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{so what made you choose migrant workers for your next book? i mean, how do you know what to write about?}
<C>__{brian}
<P>__{(kissing her neck)}
<D>__{i follow my gut, pay attention to what i'm being drawn to...}
<A>__{roberta's aroused, in spite of herself. she turns around and faces him.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{i've been waiting to do that since mr. baines' orchestra class.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{you didn't even notice me!}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{sure i did. you used to ignore me and it drove me wild.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{you had at least five different girlfriends.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{it didn't mean i had the one i wanted.}
<A>__{he gives her a flirtatious smile, then takes out one of her rollers.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{you're not a navy wife anymore...}
<A>__{he moves to takes out another roller and roberta stops him.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{yes i am... legally.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{and is it a navy requirement that you dress like it's the 1950's?}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{i do not!}
<C>__{brian}
<P>__{(goading her)}
<D>__{who did you vote for in the last election?}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{what does that have to do with anything?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{tell me.}
<C>__{roberta}
<P>__{(hesitates, then)}
<D>__{i don't know. charles filled out my absentee ballot.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{oh my god it's even worse than i thought!}
<P>__{(touching her hair)}
<D>__{is this the same roberta who got the orchestra to strike until they gave us new uniforms?}
<A>__{she laughs wistfully, then looks a little sad.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{that roberta's not around anymore.}
<A>__{he pulls her towards him by the belt to her robe.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{i don't believe that.}
<A>__{they kiss and it heats up quickly. roberta pulls back.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{i shouldn't.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{because?}
<C>__{roberta}
