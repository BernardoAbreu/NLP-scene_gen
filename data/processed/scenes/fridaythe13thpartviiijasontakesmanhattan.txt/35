<L>__{interior bridge close on harpoon day}
<A>__{sharp and rusty, mounted on the wall amidst jagged scaling knives, shark jaws and other artifacts. widen to reveal they are surrounding a navigational chart on the cruise ship's bridge. admiral robertson and his chief engineer are preparing for departure, checking the omega satellite computer as well as the loran.}
<C>__{admiral robertson}
<P>__{(checking watch)}
<D>__{let's take in the brow.}
<C>__{chief engineer}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<P>__{(into intercom phone.)}
<D>__{take in the gangway and single up all lines.}
<A>__{sean and miles enter the room; sean gets a glance from his dad. miles is very impressed with the bridge.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{hello, dad.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{hey, admiral robertson. love your ship.}
<C>__{admiral robertson}
<D>__{she's a beauty, isn't she? i should've retired from the navy ten years ago.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{you've really been generous to give us this cruise. i know i speak for everybody on board.}
<A>__{everybody...with the possible exception of sean. he avoids eye contact with his father.}
<C>__{admiral robertson}
<D>__{hell, there's just twenty or so of you we only need a skeleton crew and it's a pleasure to sail her anyway.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{by the way, congratulations on winning the intramural diving championships, miles. i'm sure you made your old man proud.}
<A>__{admiral robertson gives his own son a glance; maybe sean should think about doing the same.}
<C>__{chief engineer}
<D>__{have you decided on your departure protocol, admiral?}
<C>__{admiral robertson}
<D>__{actually, i thought i'd leave the honors to my son.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{dad, i don't think...}
<C>__{admiral robertson}
<P>__{(to chief engineer, ignoring sean)}
<D>__{relinquishing command of the princess ruby to captain sean robertson.}
<A>__{sean has no say in the matter. miles can feel his friend's nervousness as well.}
<C>__{admiral robertson}
<D>__{but before you take the helm, take this.}
<A>__{he tosses sean a wrapped box. sean opens it. inside is a navigational computer the size of a calculator, sitting next to a rusty old sextant.}
<C>__{admiral robertson}
<D>__{something old and something new. i used the sextant when i was your age, but now they have these goddamn computers to do all the work for you.}
<C>__{chief engineer}
<P>__{(to sean)}
<D>__{have you decided on a plan of departure, captain?}
<A>__{sean's nervous. he eyes the omega, quickly glancing at the loran, briefly referring to the navigational chart.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{how about if we start up the forward engines and come around. 180 degrees...}
<C>__{admiral robertson}
<D>__{aren't you forgetting something?}
<A>__{sean looks flustered. admiral robertson storms to a large button, pressing it three times, piercing the air with three long blasts of the ship's horn. it underscores his frustration.}
<C>__{admiral robertson}
<D>__{we're in foggy weather! send out the international maritime signal that a vessel is backing down, followed by a security broadcast warning other ships!}
<A>__{he shoves the mike out at sean, but he doesn't grab it, leaving the bridge, humiliated. there's an awkward moment for miles, unable to find any appropriate words. he exits as well. admiral robertson stares out the bridge window, saddened and frustrated. it wasn't supposed to go this way.}
