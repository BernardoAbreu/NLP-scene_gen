<L>__{interior harry's bedroom same time}
<A>__{harry is on the phone, smoking a cigar. his pajama top is unbuttoned, his hair is allover the place. his bed is a mess, laptop open, newspapers spilling onto the floor. erica stands in the doorway. he quickly hides his cigar.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{can you hold a see, doll?}
<P>__{(looks to erica)}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{okay, here's the thing. i really don't want to play the part of the uptight nurse to your bad boy patient. if you want to have another heart attack, go ahead, it's your life but i have work to do and i don't have time to make another run to the hospital because you're filling your already clogged arteries with smoke but more importantly, i'd rather not have my house smell like a pool hall.}
<A>__{erica holds out a partially filled water glass for harry to deposit his cigar in.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i have a question for you.}
<A>__{she waits. she doesn't say anything.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{what? do i hhave to say what?}
<C>__{arry}
<D>__{have you always been like this or do i bring this out in you?}
<A>__{she shakes the water glass, waiting for the deposit. he drops the cigar in.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i don't think i've ever had this effect on a woman before.}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(picking up the newspapers)}
<D>__{and what effect do you think you're having on me?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i don't quite recognize it, that's how i know i've never had it before.}
<A>__{erica rolls her eyes as she finishes cleaning up.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{so you don't sleep?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i only need about four hours a night.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{me too. never slept eight hours in my life.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{me either. i wish i could. ..but...}
<P>__{(re: curtains)}
