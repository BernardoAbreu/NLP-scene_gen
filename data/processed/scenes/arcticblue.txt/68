<A>__{corbett's right hand is still handcuffed to the wall unit. terrified about being alone with corbett, anne marie cautiously puts a cup of coffee in front of him.}

<D>__{how long have you been up north?}
<C>__{anne marie}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{six months.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{can't be. too keen a sense of this place in your pictures.}
<C>__{anne marie}
<D>__{six months this time. i was born in the aleutians.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{your people alaskan?}
<A>__{anne marie doesn't want to talk to a killer, but corbett is so soft spoken and charming that she answers despite herself.}
<C>__{anne marie}
<D>__{my dad was a navy doctor.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{knew you had no native blood, even with your dark hair. blue eyes give you away. my wife had blue eyes.}
<C>__{anne marie}
<D>__{had?}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{she's dead.}
<C>__{anne marie}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{had some good years. met her in '66. she showed up one day in coldfoot. no one knew her. one sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder. didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.}
<P>__{(off anne marie's amazed look)}
<D>__{my bid was eight thousand dollars. beautiful girl.}
<C>__{anne marie}
<D>__{how did she..?}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{i was gone, in september, laying traplines. she went to our cache for some meat. got mauled by a bear. tore open her skull. more }
<C>__{corbett }
<D>__{might've lived if she got help, but the exposed part of her brain froze.}
<A>__{anne marie shudders. smiling good naturedly, corbett looks around, spotting the package anne marie's new dress came in.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{what about you why come back? classy girl like you seems more suited to the finer things.}
<C>__{anne marie}
<D>__{that's why i left, moved to washington. when i met eric i was doing day shoots products and fashion, mostly. pretty dull. eric was teaching college, and then he got the job with northland oil. we wanted to stay together, so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography... and here i am.}
<A>__{as she's talking, the turtle rocks slightly. she looks out the tiny window. her pov through window eric is putting wilder's body inside an enclosed storage compartment built flush into the side of the turtle.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{horrified, anne marie turns away.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{you should know something.}
<C>__{anne marie}
<D>__{i don't want to talk any more.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{wasn't my intention to hurt wilder. i'm telling you the truth. i liked the man. i only meant to get loose... to survive. your cheechako boyfriend better understand that.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{listen, i've got some money put away }
<C>__{anne marie}
<D>__{ don't ever think you can buy eric off, mr. corbett }
<C>__{eric }
<D>__{ cheechako?}
<A>__{eric comes in, none too thrilled about anne marie chatting with corbett.}
<C>__{anne marie}
<P>__{(translating)}
<D>__{outsider.}
<A>__{he carefully stuffs wilder's magnum in his belt and ignores anne marie's disparaging look as he does.}

<C>__{anne marie}
<D>__{wait a second.}
