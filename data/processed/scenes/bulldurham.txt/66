<L>__{exterior a local batting cage day}
<A>__{annie digs in at the plate bat in hand. crash a few feet away. annie spits on her hands, wear batting glove, pumps the bat back and forth. the mechanical pitching machine delivers kawoosh. annie swings lashes out a line drive. crash smiles.}

<D>__{see my hips?}
<C>__{crash}
<D>__{yep.}
<C>__{annie}

<C>__{crash}
<D>__{when you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.}

<C>__{annie}
<D>__{but you were pulling your hips last night.}
<C>__{crash}
<D>__{so... wanta make love?}
<A>__{annie swings and misses the next pitch.}

<C>__{annie}
<D>__{young men are uncomplicated.}
<P>__{(crash mutters)}
<D>__{and he's not "dim". he's just inexperienced. my job is to give him "life wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.}

<D>__{that's my job too.}
<A>__{annie swings and misses another pitch.}
<C>__{annie}

<A>__{annie fouls one off and digs in gamely.}
<C>__{crash}
<D>__{don't tell anybody.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{why not? if you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ! the record's...}
<C>__{crash}
<D>__{247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.}

<C>__{crash}
<D>__{fact is you're afraid of meeting a guy like me 'cause it might be real so you sabotage it with some bullshit about commitment to a young boy you can boss around }
<P>__{(whack a line drive)}
<D>__{great deal. you get to write self indulgent little poems all winter about how hard it is to find a man even though you just sent him packing }
<P>__{(whack a line drive)}
<D>__{so what do you really want? you wanta be a tragic woman figure wallowing in the bullshit of magic?}
<P>__{(whack a line drive)}
<D>__{or do you want a guy?}
<A>__{the pitching machine arm flaps. empty. silence.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{oh crash... you do make speeches...}
<A>__{crash puts the bat down, heads out the gate. she follows. a little league team arrives twenty five 10 year olds in uniform with a couple parent coaches.}
<D>__{little leaguer #1 hey, are you crash davis! can i have a autograph?!}
<A>__{crash stops to sign autographs amidst 25 little leaguers.}
