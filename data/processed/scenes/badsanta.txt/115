<A>__{willie sleeps it off behind a flimsy cardboard set.}
<L>__{interior marcus' van parking lot dusk}
<A>__{marcus and lois continue their stake out. we see gin exit the store and head for his car.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{there he is... that lousy, leatherfaced, dago motherfucker...}
<L>__{exterior quiet road night}
<A>__{marcus stands by the side of his van. it's parked on the shoulder with the hood up, jumper cables attached and hanging. lois is in the driver's seat. gin's ford 4 x 4 speeds around the corner and marcus flags him down. screeeeech! gin slams on the brakes, then backs up and pulls over. he emerges from the 4 x 4 with road rage on full brew, and strides over to the van.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{jesus, mother mary and joseph! what in the name of the holy lord fuck is the problem now?}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{sorry, the van stalled. give us a jump will ya?}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{well, i will be dipped in dogshit!... what am i, your auto mechanic now?}
<A>__{he shakes his head in disgust. grumbling, he goes back to the 4 x 4 and drives it into position. he gets out and raises the hood. the two vehicles face each other nose to nose, several feet apart as gin opens the hood.}
<C>__{gin}
<P>__{(motions to his battery)}
<D>__{help yourself, small fry.}
<A>__{marcus seems to have a little difficulty reaching the battery terminals.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{it's hard for me to reach...}
<A>__{gin grabs the cables from him. marcus takes a few steps back.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{jesus christ, give me those!}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{gin attaches the cables.}
<C>__{gin}
<P>__{(then, to lois)}
<D>__{alright, try it!}
<A>__{lois turns the key and the van starts right up. gin takes the cables off the van and closes the hood. he lights up a pall mall. marcus signals to lois. she puts the car into gear and stomps her foot on the accelerator, squashing gin between the two vehicles. angle prom inside van (slow motion): gin's face as it's squooshed up against the van's windshield. a cloud of cigarette smoke escapes his lips. lois continues to step on the gas, trying to crush him. angle on: the tires spinning in the gravel. finally, she takes her foot off the gas. the van eases back. gin falls to the ground with a groan. marcus steps up and leans over him.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{oh my, what a terrible accident!}
<C>__{lois}
<D>__{is he dead?}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{no, but it looks like you broke most of his ribs.}
<A>__{then, leaning down to gin.}
<C>__{marcus}
<P>__{(for gin's benefit)}
<D>__{i'd say maybe... fifty percent of them? or do you think thirty percent?}
<C>__{lois}
<D>__{i needed more of a running start i couldn't build up any speed.}
<A>__{marcus paces around trying to figure out what to do nexterior}
<C>__{marcus}
<P>__{(shaking his head in dismay)}
<D>__{motherfuck!}
<A>__{he grabs the jumper cables still connected to gin's 4 x 4 and clamps the other ends on gin's ears. a small jolt and a spark or two. only a minor shock.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{he grabs gin's arm and with great effort drags him over a few feet so that his head is positioned behind the front tire of the van. gin tries to crawl out of the way. angle on: gin's feet slipping on the gravel.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{put it in reverse.}
<A>__{angle on: shift level moving into reverse. angle on: lois' foot stepping on the gas pedal. wider: lois drives backwards. there's a bump and the sound of a dull pop.}
