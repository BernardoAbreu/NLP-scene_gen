<A>__{the smoke from fires. laughter. music playing. the indians have prepared food for the spaniards, who are drinking and enjoying themselves in this strange world. columbus sits with mendez, pinzon, the indian chief, elders of the village. other indians stand around, smiling, curious. the indians talk among themselves. the elders smoke primitive cigars and offer them, with good humor, to their guests. the spaniards cough and choke at first... and laugh. in return, they offer the indians wine... dogs roam around the campfires. the women openly suckle their babies. the men are entranced. pinzon draws out attention, for the first time, to a small gold ornament on the nose of one of the indians. he points to it, indicates his interest in it.}

<D>__{gold...! gold!}
<A>__{the indians says the word in his own language, laughing. we see that some of the other indians also have small gold ornaments. pinzon repeats the indian word for gold. the indian removes the ornament from his nose, gives it to pinzon, who indicates that he wants to have it. the indian nods but points to pinzon's dagger, indicating that he wants it in return. pinzon shakes his head, stops the indian from taking it.}

<D>__{by god! that's the worst trade of my life!}
<A>__{his friends laugh. innocently, the indian has taken it by the blade. he yelps, looks down at the blood welling up... a moment of tension... then mendez laughs at his clumsiness, and the elders laugh too... and the indian laughs. just outside this circle, we see the first indian we saw, squatting on his haunches, watching. this is utapan.}
