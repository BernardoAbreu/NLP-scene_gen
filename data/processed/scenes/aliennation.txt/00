<A>__{a long lens shot of a far distant metallic object hovering just above the ground maybe two or three miles away. the heat waves and the light refraction off the desert scape make the object undulate rhythmically, keeping its true shape and appearance indistinct. the video camera recording this scene zooms back, then pans over revealing a semicircle of us army vehicles and personnel. army engineers with their tripod mounted scopes and binoculars are shoulder to shoulder with the armed infantry. everyone stares off at the same point on the horizon. waiting. the video camera movements are handheld, unsteady, as it moves through the line of army personnel to reveal a second, less organized semicircle of observers fifty yards behind the army. locals from nearby towns perch in truck beds and on car roofs, budweiser and fritos at hand, eyes glued to the distant object. the video camera image climbs up onto the roof of a parked local tv van, finds the object again in the distance, zooms in, and waits, like everyone else. abruptly the video image contracts, becoming a box chromakeyed behind cnn reporter duncan crais.}
