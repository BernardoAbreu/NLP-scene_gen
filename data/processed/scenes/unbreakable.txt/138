<A>__{a steel fence leads to a set of stairs that travel down to the dozens of interconnected tracks below. david walks down about forty feet. a fenced gate with a lock stops his progress. david looks through the fence down to the tracks. just to the side is a construction site. cranes and lifts and various equipment stand idle in the area next to the section of train wreckage that has been brought to the station grounds for dismantling and salvaging. the bent shapes of the train pieces can only be glimpsed in outlines as they sit in the darkness, hundreds of feet away from the immaculately lit train station. beat. a huge metallic crack echoes through the train yard as david kicks open the fence door that holds him back from going down.}
