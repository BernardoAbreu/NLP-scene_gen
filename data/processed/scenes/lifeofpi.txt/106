<A>__{pi wakes in the sloshing water under the tarp. sunlight filters in from above. the storm has passed. richard parker lies listlessly in the side bench. pi climbs out of the waterlogged hull. a double rainbow pierces majestic clouds, the sun breaking through.}
<L>__{exterior the lifeboat day}
<A>__{the gentle sound of water lapping at the side of the lifeboat; the breeze rattling the tarp. time has passed; life on the boat has grown tougher for pi, his supplies more meager, since the raft was lost. pi lies in the bow, exhausted, delirious. he pulls himself upright, takes a drink of water and looks around, confused. richard parker lies in the stern of the boat, severely emaciated, his coat dull, his eyes clouded. shivering, pi uses the last of his strength to drag himself over to the tiger. the animal's body is curled, his tail flat. some of his fur has fallen away from his shoulders and haunches. he's a skeleton in an oversized bag of fur. pi reaches out to place a hand on the tiger. he gently touches him on one spot.}
