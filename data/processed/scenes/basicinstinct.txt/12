<L>__{interior a police department conference room day}
<A>__{nick, gus, lt. walker, harrigan, andrews, captain talcott and beth gardner. with them is an older, white haired man, dr. andrew lamott. there are copies of "love hurts" around the table.}
<C>__{lt. walker}
<D>__{dr. gardner?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i've asked dr. lamott to consult with us. this isn't really my turf. dr. lamott teaches the psycho pathology of psychopathic behavior at stanford and is also a member of the justice department's psychological profile team. dr. lamott?}
<C>__{dr. lamott}
<D>__{there are two possibilities. one. the person who wrote this book is your murderer and acted out the killing described in ritualistic, literal detail. two. someone who wants to do the person who wrote this book harm read the book and enacted the killing described to incriminate the writer.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(after a long beat)}
<D>__{what if the writer did it? what are we dealing with?}
<C>__{dr. lamott}
<D>__{you're dealing with a devious, diabolical mind. this book must have been written at least six months, maybe years before it was published. that means the writer planned the crime, at least in the subconscious, back then. the fact that the writer carried it out indicates psychopathic obsessive behavior in terms not only of the killing itself but in terms of applied advance defense mechanism.}
<A>__{a long beat.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{most times i can't tell shit from shinola, doc. what was all that you just said?}
<A>__{some grins, titters.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{she anticipates the book to be her best alibi.}
<C>__{dr. lamott}
<D>__{correct.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{she's going to say do you think i'd be dumb enough to kill anyone in the exact way i've described in my book? i wouldn't do that because i'd know i'd be a suspect.}
<A>__{a long beat as they think about it.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what if it's not the writer? what if it's someone who read the book?}
<C>__{dr. lamott}
<D>__{you're dealing then with someone so obsessed that he or she is willing to kill an irrelevant and innocent victim to place the blame on the person who wrote this book. we are talking about deep seated, obsessional hatred; an utter lack of sense of proportion or perspective.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{we've got a top of the line, once in a lifetime loony tune either way you cut it that's what you're saying, right, doc?}
<C>__{dr. lamott}
<D>__{you're dealing with someone very dangerous and very ill.}
