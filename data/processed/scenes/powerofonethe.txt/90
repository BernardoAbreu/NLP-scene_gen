<L>__{exterior carnival}
<A>__{a bell at the top of a strongman's game sounds. a big boer farmer, mallet in hand, roars in triumph, swinging the mallet again and ringing the bell again.}
<B>__{angle on pk and maria}
<A>__{walking through the carnival, munching popcorn.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{you took a big chance talking to my father the way you did.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{not really. going in i was behind on points with him. i'm english. i attend a politically suspect school. i'm a boxer.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{he likes boxers.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{all men like boxers. but not for their daughters. so i had to find some way to make an impression.}
<A>__{they get on line for the ferris wheel.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{you could have picked a more agreeable topic.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{and made much less of an impression. talk to someone about their passion. even if they disagree they'll remember you. it was really the most logical strategy if you think about it.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{do you spend hours thinking about how to deal with me, too?}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{days.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{know what i think?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you're dangerous.}
<A>__{their turn comes to mount the ferris wheel. they get into the seat and strap in.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{when i was little we would go to my grandfather's farm in the high veldt for holiday.}
<A>__{the ferris wheel starts to go up.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{my father would take me to the top of the highest hill and we'd play this game, 'what do you see' until we ran out of things to see. do you ever play that?}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{want to try?}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{the ferris wheel stops to let more people on. johannesburg glitters beyond.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{i see a forest. it goes on forever. there are giant trees which keep getting bigger and bigger over thousands of years. now you.}
<A>__{the wheel begins to move a little higher and then stops.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{i see little trees growing on the forest floor, learning to grow with the little bit of light the big trees let in. now you.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{i see the big trees getting bigger, their leaves and branches making one great green umbrella over all of africa.}
<A>__{the wheel stops again at its highest pointerior}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{i see the sun growing weaker, giving off less light. i see the big trees dying because they cannot live without a lot of light. i see the little trees take over the forest because they learn to adapt.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{you tell a very good story.}
<A>__{her eyes sparkle, making her irresistible. pk leans forward. maria turns her face towards him. her lips part slightly. they kiss tenderly. the camera rises from them to the star littered sky twinkling above. the sky goes from black to grey as the camera pans down.}
<C>__{geel piet }
<P>__{(sing song)}
<D>__{can't hit you, can't hurt you. can't hit you, can't hurt you. can't hit you, can't hurt you. that's it. good. good.}
