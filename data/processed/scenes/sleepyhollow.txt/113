<L>__{exterior van tassel estate, orchard night}
<A>__{the lantern light moves through the orchard, away from the house. we cannot make out the person. elsewhere, young masbath runs in pursuit. he hides against one tree, leans to look... the light enters forest. young masbath follows.}
<L>__{interior van tassel house, ichabod's room morning}
<A>__{ichabod's hurting. masbath helps with a shirt.}
<C>__{young masbath}
<D>__{someone left last night. looked like they headed to the square, but i lost them in the forest.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{man or woman?}
<C>__{young masbath}
<D>__{all i saw was their lantern.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{business, best hidden is hidden best at night.}
<A>__{ichabod goes to his work table, organizing his satchel.}
<C>__{young masbath}
<D>__{if someone has the horseman's skull... if they control the horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet?}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{because, i serve a fine purpose alive. it is perfection for our murderer if i return to new york city with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{we must uncover the reason these victims were targeted. what was taken from them... other than their lives? who benefits by their deaths?}
<A>__{ichabod fumbles the bottle of white powder. it bounces, cork popping out... rolls under the bed.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{damn it.}
<A>__{ichabod kneels, pained. a trail of the blood detecting powder has spilled. the bottle is out of reach.}
<C>__{young masbath}
<D>__{i will get it.}
<A>__{young masbath gets down, ready to crawl for it, but ichabod stops him, peering under.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{wait...}
<A>__{far under, near the bottle, some powder is bubbling. ichabod moves to the end of the bed and lifts, in pain. young masbath helps. they drag the bed to one side. under the bed: a satanic pentagram has been drawn in blood. ichabod stares, trying to grasp the implication. masbath is about to speak, but ichabod puts a finger to his lips. ichabod moves to lock the door.}
<C>__{young masbath}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{who did this?}
<A>__{ichabod does not answer. he picks up a wash basin and dumps the water to wash the pentagram away.}
