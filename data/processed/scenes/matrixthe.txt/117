<L>__{interior basement (matrix) day}
<A>__{this part of the basement, a dark concrete cavern, was the main mechanical room. there are four enormous boilers, dinosaur like technology that once pumped hot water like arteries. black and bloody, they squeeze out from the ceiling into the tangled web of pipes. their enemies are waiting for them. blinding lights cut open the darkness as gas masked figures fire grenade launchers. smoke blossoms from the green metal canisters. morpheus never stops moving. searching the floor, he finds what.he needs; the cover of the catch basin. cypher watches him pry open the grate, when a gas can bounces near him.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{come on!}
<A>__{cypher seems to trip as the cloud envelops him.}
