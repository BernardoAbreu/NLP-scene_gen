<A>__{young cole sees little more than the gaudy pants, the duffle, and the man's ponytail flopping as he rushes towards the gates. just then, a woman's voice cries out, "nooooooooo!" young cole turns back toward the security check point just as travelers scatter madly, some diving to the floor, others running. a terrified traveler, hitting the floor close by, looks up at young cole with panicky eyes, and asks....}

<D>__{still among the myriad microwaves, the infra red messages, the gigabytes of ones and zeroes, we find words, infinitesimally small, byte sized now, tinier even than science lurking in some vague electricity where, if we listen we can hear the solitary voice of that poet telling us, "we are no other than a moving row of magic shadow shapes that come and go round with the sun illumined lantern hold in midnight by the master of the show."}
<A>__{as the poet reads, we study the audience, mostly yuppie culture junkies or bohemians. among them, a light haired woman of twenty eight, soberly dressed, wearing glasses. she's kathryn railly. and it's her beeper that suddenly beeps. beep! beep!}
