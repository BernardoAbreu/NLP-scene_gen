<C>__{louis}
<D>__{no, i'm okay. will i really be able to dig him a grave? the soil looks thin.}
<C>__{jud}
<D>__{soil's thin, all right. but you'll manage.}
<A>__{he hands him the pick and shovel.}
<C>__{jud}
<D>__{i'm going to sit over yonder and have a smoke. i'd help you, but you've got to do it yourself. each buries his own. that's how it was done then.}
<A>__{jud walks away, leaving louis with the digging tools in one hand and the flashlight in the other. after a minute, louis walks out into the burying ground.}
