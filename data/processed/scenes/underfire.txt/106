<L>__{interior price and claire's tent later that night}
<A>__{price lies on his back on a table. claire sits in a chair, a lantern is on the table. his reclining body is not unlike rafael's. he plays with a camera without looking at it, turning it slowly, removing and replacing a lens. he's never been this calm, this unmoving. claire, however, moves around the tent like a caged animal like price normally is. she smokes. she's nervous and wired.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i spend my whole life separating how i feel from how i think and what i see from what i say that's called journalism, isn't it?}
<A>__{he nods slightly.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{it's disciplined. it civilized. it involves distinctions. i'm great at distinctions. i wish i wasn't so good at them. sometimes i envy you you don't make any it's very convenient.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the only time i don't worry about all those things is when i'm with my daughter.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{or when you're in bed.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{yes!}
<P>__{(beat changes direction)}
<D>__{my job is to find a story, then tell a story whatever it is because i believe that if enough people hear enough stories then somehow, through information alone, we all have a better chance to survive.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i believe in information.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that's a very romantic streak i have running through me maybe it's a weakness. information is good lack of information is bad. simple, eh?}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{not so simple.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{you're god damn right it's not.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you take that picture you'll take it for all the right reasons i understand.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{i'm not gonna take it.}
<A>__{he fiddles with the cameras.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{that's fine for you. but do i go back and say i interviewed rafael? do i go back and say i missed the biggest story of the war? or do i say rafael was stone cold dead that's the information, isn't it? or do i say he entertained us all in his inimitably charismatic manner around the ol' revolutionary campfire?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{can we throw up our arms and say we fell in love with the querillas because their cause was... sympathetic?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{journalists don't fall in love.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{which story do you want me to tell?}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{do what you want to do.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{christ, what the fuck are we doing here?}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{i want to be here.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{with you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what do you want.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i want this war to end.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm not going to tell the world that rafael is dead.}
<A>__{silence. claire lies down on the cot. exhausted but high. price gets off the table and goes to her.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{i love you.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i think i love you.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{don't think so much.}
<A>__{he gets on the cot with her. they kiss deeply, passionately, and begin making love.}
