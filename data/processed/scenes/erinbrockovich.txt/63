<A>__{paulsen is seeing erin out of his office.}
<C>__{paulsen}
<D>__{i gotta say, erin first time i saw you, i did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own epidemiological study.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{don't go telling anyone. it'll ruin my reputation.}
<L>__{exterior usc campus day}
<A>__{erin towers over david frankel as she walks across campus with him. he's the grittier variety of scientist: patagonia, birkenstocks, bushy beard. he's as dry as dust, and as much as dr. paulsen responded to erin, frankel barely notices her.}
<C>__{frankel}
<D>__{what kind of chromium is it?}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{there's more than one kind?}
<C>__{frankel}
<D>__{yes. there's straight up chromium does all kinds of good things for the body. there's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{harmful, like how? what would you get?}
<C>__{frankel}
<D>__{with repeated exposure to toxic levels god, anything, really respiratory disease, liver failure, heart failure, reproductive failure, chronic headaches, bone or organ deterioration plus, of course, any type of cancer.}
<A>__{he rattles it off coolly. just facts. erin's stunned.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{so that stuff it kills people.}
<C>__{frankel}
<D>__{oh, yeah. definitely. highly toxic, highly carcinogenic. bad, bad stuff.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{well, how do i find out what kind of chromium is up in hinkley?}
<C>__{frankel}
<D>__{have you been to the water board?}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{hunh uh. what's that?}
<C>__{frankel}
<D>__{every county has one. they keep records of anything water related within their jurisdiction. you should be able to find something there.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{county water board. all righty, thanks.}
<C>__{frankel}
<D>__{good luck.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{oh i wouldn't advertise what you're looking for if i were you ...}
