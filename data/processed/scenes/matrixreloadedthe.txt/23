<L>__{exterior mountain top, late day (construct)}
<A>__{trinity sits alone on the tip of an impossibly high finger of rock. it looks like it sits on the rooftop of the world. all around her, as far as the eye can see, lie mountains. their snow capped peaks are pink in the sunset light. she looks into the sunset. heavy thoughts weigh on her mind. a hand appears on her shoulder. its neo. how he got on the finger of rock is anyones guess.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{boo.}
<A>__{trinity grins slightly and pulls on his arm. there is only enough room for one on the end of the rock, so he sits down behind her.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{dont lose your balance.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{it doesnt matter if i do.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{so, you can fly.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{do you think i can?}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{i think you can do anything you want, if you believe.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{like you?}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{i dont know. i dont know exactly what i can do. trinity half turns.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{will you teach me to fly?}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{i dont know if i can.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{free your mind of doubt.}
<A>__{neo stands, and steps in front of trinity. hes on the very, very edge of the rock. he extends his hand down to her. she grabs it, and he hauls her up. her eyes dart to the ground, thousands of feet below the finger.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{in this construct program, the ground can kill.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{i wont let you fall. ever.}
<A>__{they look into each others eyes. despite the trauma theyve been through, and not even truly knowing one another, theres a connection. neo suddenly backs away. he walks on the air with perfect traction, as though hes on an invisible plane of glass. he leaves trinity standing precariously on the edge, wobbling a bit as she maintains balance against nerves. she breathes deep, and looks back up at neo, maintaining her cool even as she eyes the spectacle. neo stands a few feet away from her, completely at ease as the high altitude winds ruffle his hair. neo extends a hand to her.}
<C>__{neo}
<A>__{"its not real, trinity. youre not standing there. step out. i can do}
<D>__{it. you can, too."}
<A>__{with one last glance at the infinite drop, she steadies herself and stares straight into his eyes. blue meet brown. breathless, she steps straight out. she takes one step in the air. for a breathless second, as she steps off the edge, she is stable. when she takes her foot off the edge, though, she sways, and her foot slips, as though shes on a greasy surface bobbing up and down. she corrects herself, tries another step, sags further.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{she glances down, then locks eyes with neo. then drops like an anvil.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{whoops.}
<A>__{he dives down, shooting like a missile. trinity is calm, falling backwards, watching neo come for her. the rocky ground looms behind her. she makes no effort to reach for neo as he draws close to her. he reaches for her with all his might.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{grab me!}
<A>__{trinity makes no effort to save herself, even as collision is seconds away. she stares at him intently.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{grab on to me!}
<A>__{seeing she is doing nothing, he goes beneath her and scoops her up, superman style. he barely accomplishes this before he slows and settles onto the rocky ground. they are in a twilight glade shaded by the mountains.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{what the hell were you doing? trinity smiles slightly. her madness has a purpose.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{showing you, neo.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{showing me what? you nearly gave me a heart attack.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{i want you to know how much faith i have in you.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{oh. and this requires acts of insanity?}
<A>__{trinity smiles. she looks him up and down. she moves intimately close.}
<D>__{so, you really are superman.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{only when im plugged in.}
<A>__{trinity steps away. neo grabs her shoulder and turns her to him. he}
<D>__{attempts a kiss, but she turns her face, letting it land on her cheek.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{what? trinity looks at him, then up at the sky.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{its not you. just, not here. neo doesnt understand. trinity rolls her eyes.}
<C>__{trinity}
<A>__{"theyre watching us, you big dope. do you know how horny computer}
<D>__{geeks get?"}
