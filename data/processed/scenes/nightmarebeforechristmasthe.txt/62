<L>__{interior sally's room. night moments later.}
<A>__{sally rushes in and hurries across to her window. she stands on tip toe and strains to peer out. in the distance, between two other buildings, she can just make out a corner of jack's tower. a strange glow emanates from there. sally stares for a long time, biting her lip with worry, then decisively: sally turns to her desk. she takes out a piece of paper and a pen and writes, reading aloud as she goes:}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{dear doctor... please don't come after me again. please let me go this time. i am all grown up and need to find my own life now. i hope you will understand, some day at least. signed sally. p.s. i will come visit very soon. p.p.s. there's fresh soup in the 'fridge. p.p.p.s. it isn't spiked.}
<A>__{she adds some x's and o's to the bottom of the letter, then sets it on the pillow of her bed where the doctor will be sure to find it. she takes a needle and spool of thread out of her drawer, stuffs them into her dress, then without warning,}
<B>__{jumps out her window}
<A>__{with suicidal abandon.}
