<L>__{exterior twilight. thornfield the orchard}
<A>__{jane is alone, drinking in the beauty of the evening looking at the gardens as if she may never see them again. she turns a corner and sees rochester staring intently at something. his back is to her. she is about to tiptoe away.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{come and look at this fellow, jane.}
<A>__{jane approaches, wondering how he has sensed her presence. rochester is looking at a huge moth.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{look at his wings. he looks west indian i have never seen one like him, here. there; flown.}
<A>__{they watch the moth as it flies towards the house.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{thornfield is a pleasant place in summer, isn't it?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i will be sad to leave it.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{yes, but it can't be helped. i soon hope to be a bridegroom.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{have you found me a new situation, sir?}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{a situation, yes of course. it's the least i can do for a faithful paid subordinate such as yourself. you're to undertake the education of the five daughters of mrs dionysus o'gall of bitternut lodge, connaught.}
<C>__{jane}

<D>__{from what?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{from here. from you.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{we've been good friends, jane haven't we? but with the irish sea between us you'd soon forget me.}
<A>__{jane's great distress escapes her.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i wish i could. i wish i'd never come here. i love thornfield i've lived a full life here. i've not been trampled on or petrified or buried with inferior minds. i've talked face to face with what i reverence, with what i delight in. i've known you mr rochester }
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{then why must you be torn from me?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{because of your bride.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{i have no bride.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{but you will have.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{yes, i will.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{then i must go.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{you must stay.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{do you think i could stay to become nothing to you? am i an automaton, a machine without feelings?}
<C>__{jane }
<D>__{do you think that because i am poor, obscure, plain and little that i am soulless and heartless?}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{jane }
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i have as much soul as you and full as much heart. i'm not speaking to you through mortal flesh. it's my spirit that addresses your spirit as if we'd passed through the grave and stood at god's feet, equal as we are.}
<A>__{rochester takes jane in his arms.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{as we are.}
<A>__{jane struggles away from him.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{let me go.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{no }
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i'm a free human being with an independent will, which i now exert to leave you.}
<A>__{rochester releases her. she stands in front of him.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{then let your will decide your destiny. i offer you my hand, my heart and a share of all this.}
<A>__{he gestures towards the house, the land. jane is stunned.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{i ask you to pass through life at my side. jane, you are my equal and my likeness. it is you i intend to marry.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{are you mocking me?}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{do you doubt me?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{entirely.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{you have no faith in me?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{not a whit.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{you little sceptic.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{your bride is miss ingram }
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{what love have i for miss ingram? what love has she for me? i caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was lost and got instant coldness. i wanted to make you jealous, to move you to love me. it's you you strange, unearthly thing. i love you as my own flesh. you poor and obscure as you are please accept me as your husband.}
<A>__{jane begins to believe him.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{are you in earnest?}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{i must have you for my own.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{you wish me to be your wife?}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{i swear it.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{you love me.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{then sir, i will marry you.}
<A>__{they embrace. neither jane nor rochester moves. darkness is almost complete. still the intensity of the embrace is held.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{it will atone. it will atone.}
<A>__{a sheet of lightning momentarily lights up the sky. some moments later a distant rumble of thunder. i e. night. thornfield the front hall it is teeming with rain. rochester and jane run to the front entrance. he holds his jacket around her. lightning. they reach the dry hearth inside. thunder. they are both euphoric, breathless, laughing.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i must go.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{good night. good night.}
<A>__{he kisses her. they kiss again. jane will not let him go.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{good night.}
<A>__{as jane runs upstairs she sees mrs fairfax, deeply shocked.}
