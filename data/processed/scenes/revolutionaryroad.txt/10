<C>__{april}
<D>__{could we sort of stop talking about it now?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{sure. i just don't want you feeling bad about it, that's all. because it's not worth it. i mean, it's bad enough having to live out here among these damn people what'd you say?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{i said yes. all right, frank. could you just stop talking now, before you drive me crazy, please?}
<A>__{frank clenches his jaw and flips on the indicator.}
