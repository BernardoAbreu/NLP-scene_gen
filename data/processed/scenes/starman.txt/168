<L>__{interior elmo's diner day}
<A>__{it's bustling, loud and smoky. jenny is standing just inside the entrance. she licks her lips and tries to clear the frog out of her throat.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(small voice)}
<D>__{anybody going to...}
<A>__{nobody pays any attention to her. her voice trails off. she swallows hard and tries again, this time booming out.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{anybody going to wisconsin?}
<A>__{the activity in the diner comes to a screeching halt and in the silence jenny adds in a normal voice:}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i need a ride.}
<A>__{an older man, with a face seamed by cigarettes and weather, waves at her from the counter.}
<C>__{older man}
<D>__{i'm going to des moines. if you can wait till i finish here, you're welcome to ride along.}
<A>__{this gets some good humored cheers and catcalls.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i can wait.}
<A>__{smiling self consciously, she takes a seat at the end of the counter and orders coffee from the waitress. while she is waiting for it to come, she happens to glance outside and sees a colorado highway patrol car stopped in the yard. the officer on the passenger side is talking to one of the attendants. jenny turns away from the window and finds that she is able to watch the conversation in a strip of mirrors that runs around the top of the pie case. the squad car leaves and her coffee arrives.}
