<L>__{interior kara's room (continuous)}
<A>__{kara yawns, removes her glasses and rubs her eyes, setting danny's drawing on a pile of open books. cliffs notes and diet coke cans. telltale signs of a late night cram session. adjusting the dial on her fm alarm clock, kara begins to move about the little room, slipping out of her clothes as the subtly seductive voice of a woman comes over the radio:}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{i know this sounds crazy, harry, but i love him. i write to him every week. i think i even want to have his child }
<A>__{the woman is cut off by the nasally, steel trap voice of harry simms, talk radio's most popular man of controversy:}
<C>__{harry simms }
<D>__{let me get this straight, debi. now you're saying that not only does this guy get you sexually aroused, but now you want to bear his offspring?!}
<A>__{wearing only her bra and panties, kara moves to a full length mirror and lets down her long, flaxen hair. beneath her studious exterior, she is quite attractive: delicate features with an enviable, naturally toned figure.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{deep down, he's just like you and me. he just needs someone to understand him. someone to love him.}
<C>__{harry simms }
<D>__{you're talking about one of this nation's most notorious serial killers like he belongs in some kind of est seminar! what planet have you been on, lady? michael myers has been dead for six years!}
<A>__{a click as the woman is abruptly disconnected. kara suddenly whirls around, startled by a flash of something a face in the mirror! drawn to the window behind her, she rubs off rainy mist and peers outside. kara's p.o.v. of the large victorian frame house directly across the street. another flash of lightning reveals the shadow of a man standing in the uppermost window looking right at her!}
<B>__{angle on kara}
<A>__{frightened, her eyes lock on danny's drawing. a child's scribbling in red crayon: the triangular symbol of thorn!}
