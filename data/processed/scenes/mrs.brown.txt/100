<L>__{exterior highlands, glen gelder day}
<A>__{staying close to the ground we develop through a series of shots showing the other highlands sheet rain against heather and gorse, rivulets of water slashing through mud, crude pathways sliding in wind and all ball breakingly cold. coming up the hill, we begin to make out a hunting party. the sound first. like a small army, crashing their way up the winding path. ghillies urging on their horses and dogs, guns and equipment jangling off pony hacks an then the tall figure of john brown striding out in front. making no concession to anyone, he force marches them up the hill, eyes on the hunt ahead. behind them trot the men on horseback disraeli, ponsonby, bertie and other gentlemen, each led by ghillies and attendants, among them}

<A>__{suddenly, brown stops and raises a hand. the party halts. he listens for a second. satisfied that he has found his quarry, he brings his hand down and the party of gentlemen dismount as quietly as they can. as he waits, brown winces slightly from the pain in his side. he pulls a flask of whiskey from his sporran and drinks. all the time, disraeli keeps his eyes on brown.}
