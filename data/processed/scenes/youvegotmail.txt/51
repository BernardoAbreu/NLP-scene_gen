<L>__{interior auditorium day}
<A>__{someplace like the auditorium at the museum of broadcasting. patricia eden, joe's girlfriend, who is the editor in chief of a new york publishing house called eden books, is standing at a podium at a sales conference. in the audience are sales reps, wholesalers, etc. there's a screen behind her with pictures of the authors being flashed on it as she speaks.}
<C>__{patricia }
<D>__{and now, the book you've all been waiting for, the book it's been my dreams to publish. the legendary veronica grant has written her memoirs }
<A>__{there's a burst of applause as a photograph of veronica grant flashes on screen.}
<C>__{patricia }
<D>__{ and i'm happy to report it is just crammed with tragedy.}
<P>__{(she laughs gaily)}
<D>__{just kidding, but seriously, it's all here: poverty, addiction, divorce, tracheotomies }
<A>__{we see pictures of veronica at eight with her sharecropper family, veronica at 14 with her first child, veronica with a series of husbands, veronica in a wheelchair, etc.}
<C>__{patricia }
<D>__{ her third husband beat her up, hip replacement, and an amazing face lift where all the injected fat fell to her chin.}
<A>__{now we see a blow up of the book's jacket, with a picture of veronica on it and the title: "am i rising from ashes, or did i just forget to dust?"}
<C>__{patricia }
<D>__{this book is fabulous. and even if it weren't, it would sell like crazy, because veronica is going to plug it to death on every talk show in america. this book...}
<A>__{patricia bursts into tears.}
<C>__{patricia }
<D>__{i'm sorry. i can't talk about it without crying. veronica and i have so much in common well, not all the sad parts but we were both famous by the time we were 29 and, believe me, that's rough.}
<P>__{(wipes her nose with a kleenex, pulling herself together)}
<D>__{anyway, i just want to say that i'm especially thrilled to be publishing it. veronica lives in my building and we met in the elevator. by the time we had traveled from the eighth floor to the first, we had a deal. first printing: one million copies.}
<A>__{everyone applauds enthusiastically.}
