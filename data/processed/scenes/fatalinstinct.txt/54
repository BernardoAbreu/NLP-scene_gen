<A>__{she is following him, her eyes intense, obsessed. dizzy sits in the back seat, noodling softly on his saxophone.}
<L>__{interior ned's house night}
<A>__{ned steps into the living room carrying the box. lana comes down the stairs, pulling on a bathrobe.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{what happened to you last night?}
<C>__{ned}
<P>__{(guilty as charged)}
<D>__{why? what have you heard?}
<C>__{lana}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}

<P>__{(reflecting back)}
<D>__{only part of the time.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{i never know when you're coming home, ned. how can i ever make any plans?}
<A>__{in the b.g., through the window, we see frank drop from the second floor, right onto the seat of a waiting motorcycle. he zooms off into the night. ned steps up behind lana, slips his arms around her.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{i promise i will spend more time with you. i know it's been rough, being alone so much. but i will make it up to you. maybe we should try again, you know... to have a baby.}
<A>__{she rolls her eyes at this... changes the subject.}
<C>__{lana}

<C>__{ned}
<D>__{oh... i brought you a present!}

<C>__{lana}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{it's... sorta like a cat.}
<A>__{ned pulls out a pet skunk and puts it in lana's lap. she forces a weak smile.}
