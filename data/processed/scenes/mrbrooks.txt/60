<L>__{interior hallway detective atwood's condominium n night}
<A>__{what light there is, is coming from a room we can't see. larry nibbles at atwood collarbone, kisses a breast, strokes his hands down her sides. she shivers. he brushes his lips back and forth across her stomach and then down to where the flesh of her belly meets her pubic hair. she's watching all of this in a mirror on the opposite wall. then he sinks to his knees and buries his head between her legs. from low in her throat, atwood moans. we lose sight of the couple as we move around a corner.}
