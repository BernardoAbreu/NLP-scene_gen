<A>__{the tape revolves in the stereo, playing a beautiful ballad. charlie watches sam sway to his music like a serenade. like she is dancing with him. but she isn't. a wider angle reveals that she is slow dancing with... craig. charlie is 15 year old crushed. no filter. just feeling. patrick, alice, and mary elizabeth watch sam across the room.}

<D>__{so, what do you think?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{alice}

<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{i just hope she stops playing dumb with these guys. i keep telling her... don't make yourself small. you can't save anybody.}
<A>__{craig dips a smiling sam as the song ends. sam goes into the kitchen. craig approaches charlie. turns off his mix tape.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{man, your mix is morbidly sad, kid. how about something a little more upbeat?}
<A>__{craig grabs a record from the pile and slaps it down.}
<C>__{craig }
<D>__{sam tells me you want to be a writer.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{don't you write poetry, craig?}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{no. poetry writes me. you know?}
<A>__{charlie sighs. craig's upbeat song begins to play. he dances over to sam. charlie's heart breaks as he watches sam hug on craig.}
