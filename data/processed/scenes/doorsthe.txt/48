<A>__{day (1967) light my fire continues. documentary footage of the "human be in", the "summer of love" swarming flower children, war protestors. a staged 16mm. grainy shot of jim and pamela, ray and dorothy, john, robbie and their two new girlfriends wandering thru the crowd sharing the spirit. pam and jim fool around laughing tickling each other for the home movie camera shot by ray... pam is goofy, makes funny faces, teases him running a flower under his nose, thru his hair, then trips him. he chases her across the lawn.}
