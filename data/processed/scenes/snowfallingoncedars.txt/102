<L>__{interior courtroom later}
<A>__{pan the jury, slowly, as they hear...}
<C>__{nels }
<D>__{...not a single witness has testified to anything that could suggest pre meditated murder. not in the days before carl heine's death...or at any time...has anyone described a murderous rage toward the deceased.}
<A>__{nels stands very still. hands resting on the rail. as calm and quiet as his adversary had been dramatic.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{etta heine had cheated his family. he had asked his childhood friend carl to sell him the land. and carl was considering it.}
<A>__{leans forward. just a little.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{there is no evidence of anger at carl, much less rage , much less murderous rage. no reason for premeditation and no evidence of it. anywhere.}
<A>__{he picks out a housewife. the youngest. smiles sadly, wisely. as her grandfather might.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{and yet the state is required to prove these things. beyond. a reasonable. doubt.}
<A>__{his eyes widen.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{can you seriously think there is no reasonable doubt? why is kabuo's d 6 battery in carl's well, if carl was helping him ?}
<A>__{why?}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{why isn't the blood on the gaff more consistent with carl's hand wound than a skull fracture? given the absence of bone or brain tissue.}
<A>__{and now. he begins to pace, limping slightly, eyes down.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{what mr. hooks asks you to believe is that no proof is needed. against a man who bombed pearl harbor.}
<A>__{slow. eyes on his feet.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{look at his face, the prosecutor said. presuming that you will see an enemy there. treacherous by nature, by a thousand years of something or other.}
<A>__{he stops. looks at them.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{an argument i find as despicable as it is dishonest and twisted and insulting to us all. mr. miyamoto is a much decorated hero of the united states army. for god's sake.}
<A>__{the feeling wells in te old man. it bleeds through the very quietness of his voice.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{if someone said you should convict carl heine. or his lovely widow. of murder. without proof. because their ancestry is the same as hitler's. you would spit in his eye.}
<A>__{yes, you would.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{and every decent american. would applaud you.}
<A>__{he leans his elbows on their rail. as if confiding to them across their backyard fence.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{now kabuo miyamoto did one thing wrong. he was afraid to trust us, at first. afraid that he would be crucified by prejudice. as mr. hooks is urging you to do.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{well, we sent him. and his wife. and thousands of americans to concentration camps. they lost homes, belongings, everything. we did that, folks. can we now be unforgiving about his uncertainty? his mistrust?}
<A>__{looking in their eyes. as if waiting for an answer. they shift their weight, fidget beneath his gaze.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{you may think this is a small trial. in a small place. well, it isn't.}
<A>__{he straightens his spine. winces slightly, with the pain of it.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{every once in awhile. somewhere in the world. humanity goes on trial. and integrity. and decency. every once in awhile, common folks get called on to give the report card for the human race.}
<A>__{the eyes are watering. but the voice gains strength.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{now here in america. we relish those chances. give us that one, we say. that's why we built this country in the first place.}
<A>__{one step back. just above a whisper...}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{be americans. make your children proud.}
