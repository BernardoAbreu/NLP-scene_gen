<A>__{willow tears after the vulture which vanishes in the towering trees. as the path narrows, something whis tlse past his ear. finger length arrows rain down on him from every direction, peppering the surrounding trees. some even hit willow. he plucks them out as he races along. he comes to a fork in the path: decision! he starts down one way, then slams on the brakes. he sees ropes and nets.}

<D>__{oh no, it's a trap!}
<A>__{he hurries back to the fork and takes the safer route }

<D>__{oh noooooo!!}
