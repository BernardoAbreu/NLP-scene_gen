<L>__{exterior town dusk}
<A>__{prosperity is bathed in sunset. the mine shaft entrances are clearly visible. like black holes of malevolent promise.}
<L>__{interior palmer house garage day}
<A>__{the garage is cluttered. old station wagon. bikes. skis. sam leads chris to a bag full of her ex husband's clothes.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i guess i should watch more 'oprah.' it must be a textbook 'no dad' kind of thing.}
<A>__{chris shifts awkwardly. in shock. sad. sam holds up a flannel shirt.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{that one looks kind of scratchy.}
<A>__{sam holds up a shirt that chris approves of. he takes it and proceeds to take off his old soot stained shirt.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{all jason cared about was getting out and starting over. i guess that included buying a new wardrobe.}
<A>__{sam turns to pass chris a pair of levis. he's buttoning up the new shirt. chris takes the pants. he doesn't register sam ogling his exposed chest.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{gladys thought i should sell... but you know... i never wanted to get rich. if it was about the money, i would have sold out to wade a long time ago.}
<A>__{chris moves behind the car and takes off his pants.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i think i just wanted to prove the gold was down there. that my family wasn't crazy to keep looking. even after we'd lost so much. and now... she's gone, too.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm sorry, chris.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{do you know what i'm trying to say?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it wasn't about spending the gold, it was about finding it.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{that's right. that's exactly right.}
<A>__{sam glimpses chris through car windows. the poor guy's struggling to pull on some 501s. sam turns away, but catches sight of him in a propped up glass door.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{remind me never to let you do my laundry.}
<A>__{she turns, only to see him in a mirror. he steps out from behind the car. sam stares at him.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{they look great.}
