<L>__{interior basement shul day}
<A>__{a wise looking, bearded hasidic man with benevolent, piercing eyes stands tenderly over max. he wears traditional black clothes. lenny meyer paces nervously in the background. as max comes through, rav cohen speaks.}
<C>__{rav cohen}
<D>__{max, max. you're okay i'm rabbi cohen. cohen like you. i'm sorry for what lenny did, he's been reprimanded. it is not our way are you okay?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{yeah, yeah}
<C>__{rav cohen}
<D>__{everything will be fine, max. you need to give us the number. do you have it?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<P>__{(charging over)}
<D>__{i told you we don't know}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you wouldn't be so flipped out if you didn't know. what's happening to me?}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{give us the number!}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{screw you!}
<C>__{rav cohen}
<D>__{okay, okay! lenny, easy! max, i will tell you what's going on. just calm down.}
<P>__{(deep breath, then)}
<D>__{the talmud tells us it began two thousand years ago, when the romans destroyed the second temple.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{what are you...}
<C>__{rav cohen}
<D>__{just give me a chance. you'll understand everything if you listen.}
<A>__{max takes out his pills and starts feeding himself some.}
<C>__{rav cohen}
<D>__{the romans also murdered all of our priest hoodthe cohanimthe cohens, and with their deaths they destroyed our greatest secret. in the center of the great temple was the holy of holies which was the heart of jewish life. this was the earthly residence for our god. the one god. it contained the ark of the tabernacle which stored the original ten commandments that god gave to moses. only one man could enter this space once a year on the holiest day of the year, yom kippur on the day of atonement, all of israel would descend upon jerusalem to witness the high cohen's trip into the holy of holies. if the holy man was pure he would reemerge a few moments later and israel was secured a prosperous year. it meant that we were one yea r closer to the messianic age. closer to the return of the garden of eden. but if he was impure, he would die instantly and it meant that we were doomed. the high cohen had a single ritual to perform in the holy of holies. he had to intone a single word.}
<A>__{rav cohen takes a dramatic pause. max is anxious to hear the end of the story.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{rav cohen}
<D>__{that word was the true name of god.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{rav cohen}
<D>__{the true name, which only the cohanim knew, was two hundred and sixteen letters long.}
<A>__{a long beat.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{you're telling me that the number in my head is the name of god!?}
<A>__{wondrously, max rubs the scar on his head.}
<C>__{rav cohen}
<P>__{(passion building)}
<D>__{yes...it's the key into the messianic age. as the romans burned the temple, the talmud says, the high cohen walked into the flames. he took his secret to the top of the burning building. the heavens opened up and took the key from the priest's outstretched hand. we've been searching for the key ever since. and you may have found it. now let us find out.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{that's what happened. i saw god.}
<C>__{rav cohen}
<D>__{no, no, max. you're not pure. you can't see god unless you're pure.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{it's more than god... it s everything. it's math and science and nature... the universe. i saw the universe's dna}
<C>__{rav cohen}
<D>__{you saw nothing.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i saw everything.}
<C>__{rav cohen}
<D>__{there's much more. we can unlock the door with the key. it will show god that we are pure again. he will return us to the garden.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{garden? you're not pure. i'm the one who has the number}
<C>__{rav cohen}
<D>__{who do you think you are? you are a vessel from our god. you are carrying a delivery that needs to be made to us.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{it was given to me. it's part of me. it's changing me.}
<C>__{rav cohen}
<D>__{it's killing you. because you are impure.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{it will kill you!}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{and what will it do to you?}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{we're pure. give us the number!}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{the number is nothing. you know that!}
<C>__{rav cohen}
<D>__{we can use it. we can wield it.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{it's just a number. i'm sure you've written down every two hundred sixteen number. you've translated all of them. you've intoned them all. haven't you? but what's it gotten you? it's not the number! it's the meaning. it's the syntax. it's what's between the numbers. if you could understand you would. but it's not for you! i've got it. i understand it. i'm going to see it!}
<P>__{(whispers to rav cohen)}
<D>__{rabbi...i was chosen.}
