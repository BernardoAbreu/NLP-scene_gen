<L>__{17 terrace. kader's house. outside. night.}
<A>__{it is a starry night and there are few lights visible in the windows of the casbah. in the background, there is the triumphant neon of the european city, the sea, the ships at anchor, the shining beams of a lighthouse. kader turns around gracefully, and goes to sit on the wall of the terrace.}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{you could have been a spy. we had to put you to the test.}
<A>__{ali looks at him sullenly.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{with an unloaded pistol?}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{i will explain.}
<A>__{kader is a few years older than ali, but not so tall. he is slender with a slight yet sturdy bone structure. the shape of his face is triangular, aristocratic, his lips thin, his eyes burning with hatred, but at the same time, cunning. he continues to speak in a calm tone which has an ironic touch to it.}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{let's suppose you were a spy. in prison, when the nlf contacts you, you pretend to support the revolution, and then the french help you to escape ...}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{sure. by shooting at me.}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{even that could be a trick. you escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{i don't even know your name yet ...}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{my name is kader, ali ... saari kader ... in other words, in order to join the organization, you had to undergo a test. i could have told you to murder the barman, but he's an algerian ... and the police would let you kill him, even though he is one of theirs. by obeying such an order, you still could have been a double agent. and that's why i told you to kill the french policeman: because the french wouldn't have let you do it. if you were with the police you wouldn't have done it.}
<A>__{ali has followed kader's logic a bit laboriously, and he is fascinated by it. but not everything is clear yet.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{but i haven't shot him.}
<C>__{kader}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{you weren't able to. but what's important is that you tried.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{what's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{c'mon ... you're exaggerating. the orders were to shoot him in the back.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{i don't do that kind of thing.}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{then don't complain.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{you still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{because we aren't ready yet for the french. before attacking, we must have safe places from which to depart and find refuge. of course, there is the casbah. but even the casbah isn't safe yet. there are too many drunks, pushers, whores, addicts, spies ... people who talk too much ... people who are ready to sell themselves, undecided people. we must either convince them or eliminate them. we must think of ourselves first. we must clean out the casbah first. only then will we be able to deal with the french. do you understand, ali?}
<A>__{ali doesn't answer. kader has come down from the wall and looks toward the casbah. ali too looks toward the casbah, immersed in the night.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{and how many are we?}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{not enough.}
