<A>__{anna, oliver, elliott, shauna and arthur drive up sunset blvd. they arrive at alvarado, park and get out. above them a well lit large blank white billboard. as oliver and elliott get spray paint cans from the back of the car...}

<D>__{oliver, don't write any of that serious stuff, okay? just write something funny. girls like funny.}
<L>__{exterior rooftop}
<A>__{the gang get to the top of the stairs, on to the roof where they can see the large blank billboard towering in front of them.}
<C>__{shauna}
<D>__{you know what? here, give me arthur. we'll just stay here and get arrested. you know, that's good.}
<A>__{oliver leaves arthur with her, and anna and elliott and him head off to the billboard. they climb it's structure, it's high and a bit scary. on the top is a gang plank looking over the city. anna is happy she came. elliott goes to paint the back side of the billboard. oliver meets up with anna, over looking the city.}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{yeah. i'm gonna stay here with my new friend (the handrail she holds).}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{oliver walks out and writes big letters across the billboard. you make me laugh but it's not funny. he makes his way back. anna's not where she was, he looks and finds her in the gangways between the two billboards with a view to downtown below her.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{c'est beau ici.}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{he comes to her, wanting to get beyond the romance somehow.}
<C>__{oliver}
<D>__{i'm trying to impress you.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(gasps ironically) really?}
<A>__{she walks to him and puts her hands around his head, somehow it's more intimate and vulnerable now.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it's working.}
<A>__{they kiss. moments later. they're at the bottom of the ladder. they all run back to their car.}
