<L>__{exterior suburban street night}
<A>__{ellie and grant head toward the rental car parked in the driveway.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{good luck with the fund raising.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{it was never easy, but before jurassic park, you could find money. somewhere. now fossils are out. everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{times change alan. but you're the still the best. i mean that.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{the last of my breed.}
<A>__{a long moment passes between them as both consider where they've ended up.}
<C>__{grant }
<D>__{i'd better get going.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{let me know if i can help, alan. youre bad about asking for help, but please ask me. anything, anytime.}
<C>__{grant}
<P>__{(deep down knowing he never will)}
<D>__{okay. goodbye, ellie.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{goodbye, alan.}
<A>__{not sure what the right thing to do is, they finally end up with a friendly hug. they keep it short. grant gets in his car. starts the engine. he's about to pull off when ellie knocks on the window. he rolls it down.}
<C>__{ellie }
<D>__{when i met you, i thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. wiped out. but you told me otherwise. when conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. they became other things. they evolved.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{a well accepted theory.}
<C>__{ellie}
<P>__{(simply)}
<D>__{alan don't be afraid to evolve.}
<A>__{grant hears her, but ellie knows it didn't really get through. a forced half smile, than grant waves goodbye. ellie watches as he drives off.}
