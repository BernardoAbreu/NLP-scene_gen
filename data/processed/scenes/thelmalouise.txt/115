<A>__{louise and jimmy are sitting on the edge of the bed. jimmy has put the ring on her finger and they both are looking at it, as jimmy holds her hand in his. they both ponder it.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{it does look good.}
<L>__{interior thelma's room night}
<A>__{j.d. is standing on the dresser with a towel tied around his neck like a cape.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{faster than a speeding green t bird, able to leap tall babes in a single bound...}
<A>__{he leaps from the dresser and flies across the room landing on the bed, straddling thelma.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<P>__{(in his deep man's voice)}
<D>__{hi. could i interest you in some fuller brushes?}
<A>__{thelma has not stopped laughing since he came in the room. he is the greatest guy she's ever seen. he is sniffing her neck like a dog.}
<C>__{thelma}
<P>__{(giggling)}
<D>__{stop, stop, stop!}
<A>__{thelma tries to catch her breath.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{who are you?}
<A>__{j.d. attacks her again.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{i am the great and powerful oz...}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{j.d.! just tell me. i know you're not some schoolboy. now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{i'm just some guy. a guy whose parole officer is probably having a shit fit right about now.}
<A>__{thelma gasps.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{what?! parole officer? you mean you're a criminal?}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{well, not anymore, thelma, except for bustin' parole, i haven't done one wrong thing.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{what did ya do?}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{i'm a robber.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{you're a bank robber?}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{nope. i've never robbed a bank.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{well, i robbed a gas station once, and i robbed a couple of liquor stores, and some convenience stores. and that's it.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{well, i was just down on my luck and it seemed like somethin' i was good at so i...}
<C>__{thelma}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{no, i mean how would you do it? do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{naw, honey, that would be burglary. i never got arrested for burglary. burglary's for chicken shits. if you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it. just take the money. that's robbery. that's a whole 'nother deal.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{tell me.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{well, first you pick your place, see, then i'd just sit back and watch it for awhile. ya gotta wait for just the right moment, which is something you know instinctively, that can't be taught. then i'd waltz on in...}
<A>__{j.d. jumps up and picks up a hair dryer and holds it like a gun. he starts acting it out.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{and i'd say, "alright, ladies and gentlemen, let's see who'll win the prize for keepin' their cool. simon says everybody lie down on the floor. if nobody loses their head, then nobody loses their head. you sir... you do the honors. just empty that cash into this bag and you'll have an amazing story to tell all your friends. if not, you'll have a tag on your toe. you decide." then i'd split. simple.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{my gosh, you sure gentlemanly about it.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{i've always believed if done right, armed robbery doesn't have to be a totally unpleasant experience.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{god. you're a real live outlaw!}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{i may be the outlaw, but you're the one stealin' my heart.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{and smooth, boy, you are smooth.}
<A>__{they kiss passionately.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{you're kinda the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{you're a little angle, you are.}
<A>__{j.d. turns out the light.}
