<L>__{int ray's house kitchen day}
<A>__{ray and rachel are running as fast as they can up the stairs into the kitchen. bam!! the lighting continues again and makes rachel scream.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{it's okay. you're fine.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{it hit right behind our house.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{yeah, well it's not gonna hit there again because lighting doesn't strike twice in the same place.}
<A>__{bam!! it hits again and makes ray jump.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{oh, shit!}
<A>__{they both get under the table for safety as the lighting continues. they both begin panicking. bam!! bam!! bam!! the lightning goes on with no apparent end. ray and rachel both scurry on the floor under the table as the lighting goes on.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{where's robbie?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{is robbie okay? (no response) are you okay?}
<A>__{bam! the lighting continues.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{where's the thunder?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{why won't it stop?}
<A>__{pan out from under the table as the lightning subsides and all is silent.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(with hesitation) is it over?}
<A>__{ray remains speechless as he is fixated on the area where the lightening came from. ray climbs out from under the table to get an idea of what just happened.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{just checking things out. just wait, wait there.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{are we going to be okay?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you don't know.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{no. i meant... rachel, please, just stop asking so many questions. just wait here.}
<A>__{ray walks around to various parts of the kitchen to see if everything is okay. the power is off. after saying "just wait here" he then walks into the living room. nothing in the living room has power. he checks his phone which doesn't work. he tries his cell phone which also appears to not work at all. he sees his watch which has also stopped working.}
