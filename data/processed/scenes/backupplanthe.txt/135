<A>__{some fantastic song that makes us want to cry is playing... we are close on zoe's face. she is smiling. she does not look scared. and she does not look alone. widen to reveal stan by her side. and we pull back and above the operating table and see dr. harris performing the c section. he pulls out the babies one by one. we follow the babies as they get swaddled tight and handed back to zoe and stan. zoe and stan look at the little girls and then at each other. they are both in tears. even dr. harris can't help but cry.}
