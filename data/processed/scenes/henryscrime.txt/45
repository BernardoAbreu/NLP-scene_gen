<A>__{henry looks up : we travel around him, see what he sees :}
<B>__{the first buffalo bank}
<A>__{directly across the street. holding on henry as he contemplates the place... henry takes a deep breath. focuses in. there's something happening, he's not sure what it is...an idea perhaps, an instinct that somehow with each passing moment becomes more like a knowing.... a moment of revelation. he starts across the street toward the bank, moving now, heading right toward the front door, transfixed, as the sound drops out and he begins to smile screeeech! a car hits henry in the side. he's knocked down. a girl (30s) rushes out of the car.}
