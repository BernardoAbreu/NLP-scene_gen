<D>__{jenny working hard in her room. it's been completely stripped bare of everything except schoolbooks. she has become ageless, genderless her life is now monastic.}
<L>__{exterior park. day}

<L>__{interior coffee bar. day}
<D>__{jenny on her own, smoking nervously. hattie and tina come in. they obviously haven't seen her since it all happened. they both hug her sympathetically and sit down. nobody knows what to say.}

<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{yes. who'd have thought there'd be a down side to all that? i could tell you all about the imagery in jane eyre. but i couldn't see that a man who stole maps from old ladies might be a liar. they look at her. this is new information.}
