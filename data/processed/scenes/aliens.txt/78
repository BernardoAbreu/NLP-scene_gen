<L>__{interior medical wing}
<A>__{they pack lights play over the devastation of the colonists' last ditch battle. the equipment of the med labs has been uprooted to add to the barrier. the walls are perforated by pulse rifle fire and acid. scorched by untended fires to bare metal. a few instruments glow with emergency power.}
<C>__{wierzbowski}
<D>__{last stand.}
<C>__{gorman}
<D>__{no bodies?}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{no, sir. looks like it was a helluva fight.}
<A>__{tight on ripley transfixed by something.}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(low)}
<D>__{over there.}
<A>__{the others turn and approach, seeing what she sees. she has entered a second room, part of the med lab area. in a storage alcove at near eye level stand seven transparent cylinders. stasis tubes. they glow faintly with an eerie violet light given off by the field which preserves the specimens inside. they look like jars containing severed arthritic hands, the palsied fingers curled in a death rictus. structurally they are more like spiders with sickening translucent skin, a flacid scrotal body, gill like organs underneath drifting in the suspension fluid. something you definitely do not want on your face, for example.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{are these the same...?}
<A>__{ripley nods, unable to speak. burke leans closer in fascination. his face almost touching one cylinder, is lit by its glow.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{watch it, burke...}
<A>__{the creature inside lunges suddenly, slamming against the glass. burke jumps back. from the palm of the thing's handlike body emerges a pearl escent tubule. like a tapered piece of intestine, which slithers tonguelike over the inside of the glass. then it retracts into a sheath between the "gills."}
<C>__{hicks}
<P>__{(to burke)}
<D>__{it likes you.}
<A>__{only two of the creatures seem to pulse with life. burke taps the other stasis cylinders but the hand things remain inertly clenched.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{these are dead. there's just the two alive.}
<A>__{on top of each cylinder is a file folder. ripley takes a folder from above one of the live specimens. inside is a medical chart printout with handwritten entries.}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{removed surgically before embryo implantation. subject: marachuk, john l. died during procedure.}
<P>__{(looking up)}
<D>__{they killed him getting it off.}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{poor bastard.}
<A>__{they are startled by a loud beep. they turn. hicks is intent on his motion tracker, aimed back toward the shattered barricade. beep. beep.}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{behind us.}
<A>__{he gestures at the corridor they just passed through.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{one of us?}
<C>__{gorman}
<P>__{(into headset)}
<D>__{apone...where are your people? anybody in d block?}
<C>__{apone}
<P>__{(voice over; filtered)}
<D>__{negative. we're all in operations.}
<A>__{vasquez swings the smart gun to ready position on its support arm, locking it with an authoritative click. she and hicks head toward the source of the signal, the others following.}
