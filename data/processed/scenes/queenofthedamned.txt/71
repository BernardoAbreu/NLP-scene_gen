<L>__{interior marius's villa night}
<A>__{lestat lays in bed, feverish, his skin paler than ever. at the foot of the bed stands marius.}
<C>__{marius}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{lestat?}
<A>__{the young vampire's eyes bulge open in the grip of some incredible sensation, smiling the most wicked of smiles. lestat's chest heaves upward, pulling his body with it, only to be jerked back by the manacles that hold him to the bed.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{more!}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{i don't think so, my little lord.}
<A>__{lestat writhes with a physical delight that is almost painful. lestat realizes he is shackled to the bed with manacles and chains. struggles against them.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{let me go!}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{no. you've drunk the purest blood. seen the oldest of things far too much for one as young as you. you've been unconscious for days.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{god, her blood is like liquid fire.}
<P>__{(squirms)}
<D>__{who are they?}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{she... she is your mother, my mother... akasha, the queen of all who are damned. and he is her king.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{release me!}
<A>__{lestat struggles with all his might. one of his manacles splits, releasing a leg. marius stares, surprised.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{she made you quite powerful.}
<P>__{(withdrawing a saber from its sheath)}
<D>__{don't make me use this!}
<A>__{lestat still struggles. the manacles strain.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{marius, please, just one more time. i felt the sun. the light, marius, the light!}
<A>__{suddenly pressing the knife to lestat's throat }
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{lestat, listen to me! i have watched over akasha and her king for 2000 years! they must never awaken!}
<A>__{lestat stares up at him.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{akasha and her king nearly drank this earth dry when they ruled over egypt. they drank until they lost their will to drink. they became living statues. and yet akasha still sustains the life force of all vampires. it is believed what happens to her, happens to all of us.}
<A>__{lestat gazes up at him, taking it in. marius moves slowly away.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{if she were ever to rise, she would again desiccate the earth! she has no respect for anything except the taste of blood. immortal and human alike...}
<A>__{lestat roars and struggles against his manacles.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{you'll not stop me...}
<A>__{marius stares at him, shocked.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{i hear her blood in your voice... in all the years i've cared for them, not once have they moved...}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{until tonight. and she chose me! me! never you! you'll not stop me!}
<A>__{marius moves at super speed, grabs lestat by the neck, and pins him down.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{you are part of a great coven! you take responsibility for your kind!}
<C>__{lestat}
<P>__{(snarls)}
<D>__{i must have more!}
<A>__{lestat, lost, looks at marius, his eyes intoxicated with akasha's blood. marius steps back. looks at his fledgling with great sadness, anger, disappointment.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{i chose you for your bravery, but i was wrong. you know only selfishness. i can no longer trust you... it gives me no pleasure to look upon what i have created.}
<A>__{marius turns his back on lestat. lestat stares after him.}
