<L>__{interior kitchen day}
<A>__{peter's giving mary her bottle, jack is carefully putting all her stuff into a bag bottles, nipples, cereals, etc. in the doorway sylvia, with reddened eyes, silently watches them.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{let's see, the five bottles, the little bottles for water, the strainer for her cereal...}
<P>__{(to sylvia)}
<D>__{... do you have a blender?}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{a blender?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{for bananas and carrots and stuff. it's time for her to start eating them...}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{no, i don't have a blender.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{okay, you can have ours.}
<A>__{he stuffs the blender into the bag. mary has now finished her bottle.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<P>__{(to peter)}
<D>__{do you want me to take her?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{no, i have to burp her first.}
<A>__{with dexterity, he places mary face down on his shoulder and walks around in the kitchen, patting her on the back.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(to sylvia)}
<D>__{here, could you give these to michael so he can pack them with the clothes?}
<A>__{he hands two bibs to sylvia. sylvia walks through the apartment, and stops in front of michael's room, where she looks strangely at the changing table with its mattress, its pretty sheet, and the baby's toilet articles. sylvia enters the living room. michael has spread all of mary's clothes, neatly folded and ironed on the couch. he is packing them in a big bag.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{here are the bibs. jack told me to give them...}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(taking the bibs)}
<D>__{thanks... i put the woolen things on the bottom and the diapers and lighter things on top, because you'll need those first...}
<C>__{sylvia}
<P>__{(her mind is elsewhere)}
<D>__{yeah, sure...}
<A>__{michael bustles about. sylvia's gaze comes to rest on the crib which stands imposingly in the middle of the living room. music boxes, little booties and stuffed animals are hanging from the bars, and a pretty white tulle frames the crib.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you'll have to come back and get the crib later.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{yeah...}
