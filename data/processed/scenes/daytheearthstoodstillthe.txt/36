<L>__{interior hospital room full shot}
<A>__{as harley enters, closing the door behind him. klaatu no longer wears his helmet and we see his face clearly for the first time. even sitting up in bed, with his shoulder strapped in bandages, he is a figure of great authority. his face reflects inner dignity and assurance. harley, who is a hardened diplomatist, can't help being impressed by his present assignment and a little awed by klaatu. harley obviously has been sent by the president to find out what he can. klaatu's eyes study him, cool, penetrating, reserved.}
<C>__{harley}
<D>__{my name is harley secretary to the president}
<P>__{(klaatu continues to study him silently)}
<D>__{i've been told that you speak our language that your name is mr. klaatu.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(coolly)}
<D>__{just klaatu.}
<C>__{harley}
<D>__{the president asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened. we all feel }
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(evenly)}
<D>__{sit down, mr. harley.}
<A>__{somewhat relieved, harley seats himself. he speaks with a half smile, hoping to ease the tension.}
<C>__{harley}
<D>__{i'm sure i don't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise.}
<P>__{(getting a little}
<D>__{smile from klaatu, he is encouraged to}
<P>__{do some fishing)}
<D>__{had you been traveling long?}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{about five months your months.}
<C>__{harley}
<D>__{you must have come a long way.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{about 250 million of your miles.}
<A>__{harley glances at him quickly to be sure he's not joking. he's not.}
<C>__{harley}
<D>__{naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(easily; he's a diplomat, too)}
<D>__{from another planet. let's just say that we're neighbors.}
<A>__{harley reacts, as his wildest assumptions are so blandly corroborated.}
<C>__{harley}
<D>__{it's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{i'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.}
<C>__{harley}
<P>__{(eyebrows raised)}
<D>__{the present situation?}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{i mean the reasons for my coming here.}
<C>__{harley}
<P>__{(his eagerness apparent)}
<D>__{we're very curious about that, too. would you care to talk about it?}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{i'd be glad to.}
<P>__{(noticing that harley}
<D>__{is settling himself}
<P>__{expectantly)}
<D>__{not now, of course with you alone.}
<C>__{harley}
<D>__{perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the president }
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(somewhat sharply)}
<D>__{this is not a personal matter, mr. harley. it concerns all the people on your planet.}
<C>__{harley}
<P>__{(startled by the scope of this statement)}
<D>__{i i'm not sure i understand }
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{i want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the earth.}
<C>__{harley}
<P>__{(shocked and perturbed by this notion)}
<D>__{i'm afraid that would be a little awkward. it's it's completely without precedent. and there are practical considerations the time involved the enormous distances.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(coolly)}
<D>__{i traveled 250 million miles. what about your united nations?}
<C>__{harley}
<P>__{(surprised and a little puzzled)}
<D>__{you know about the united nations?}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{we've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. that's how we learned your languages. lately, we've been getting your television also.}
<C>__{harley}
<P>__{(wryly)}
<D>__{you must have a rather strange impression of us.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{the first two years of television we were convinced that all you did was wrestle.}
<A>__{harley smiles. then his mind reverts to the seriousness of the situation and he speaks gravely.}
<C>__{harley}
<D>__{i'm sure you recognize from our broad casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. surely you would agree }
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(evenly)}
<D>__{i am not concerned, mr. harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. i consider that to be your business not mine.}
<C>__{harley}
<D>__{i was only hoping to make you understand.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(sternly, impressively)}
<D>__{my mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. it concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on earth.}
<C>__{harley}
<P>__{(uncomfortably)}
<D>__{perhaps if you could explain a little }
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{i intend to explain. to all the nations simultaneously.}
<P>__{(his manner precludes opposition)}
<D>__{how do we proceed, mr. harley?}
<A>__{harley is thoroughly shaken. the tremendous force and power implicit in klaatus's manner preclude the possibility of argument.}
<C>__{harley}
<P>__{(after a long thoughtful moment)}
<D>__{we could call a special meeting of the general assembly... but of course the un doesn't represent all of the nations.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{then why not a meeting of all the chiefs of state?}
<C>__{harley}
<P>__{(helplessly, but patiently)}
<D>__{believe me, you don't understand. they wouldn't sit down at the same table.}
<A>__{growing a little impatient with such nonsense, klaatu eyes him evenly, speaks with jovian authority.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{i don't want to resort to threats, mr. harley. i simply tell you bluntly that the future of your planet is at stake... i suggest you transmit that message to the nations of the earth.}
<A>__{the eyes of the two men meet for a long, silent moment. then harley rises quietly.}
<C>__{harley}
<D>__{i will make that recommendation to the president.}
<P>__{(he picks up his brief case and hat)}
<D>__{i must tell you in all honesty that i'm extremely dubious about the results.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(with a half smile)}
<D>__{apparently i'm not as cynical about earth's people as you are.}
<C>__{harley}
<D>__{i've been dealing in earth's politics a good deal longer than you have.}
<P>__{(he bows)}
<D>__{goodnight, sir.}
<A>__{he turns and goes out. close shot klaatu he stares after harley for a moment, puzzled by this strange and apparently unreasoning world he has come to. he shakes his head in thoughtful, tolerant bewilderment.}
