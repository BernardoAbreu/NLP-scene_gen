<L>__{exterior commercial building rooftop. day}
<A>__{colin looks out through the door, no gun drawn, but very much a cop clearing his corners. he steps out and billy takes him from behind the door, his only blind side, and grabs the back of his collar and crams a pistol into the bottom of his skull.}

<D>__{get your hands up. hands. hands.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{put the fuckin' gun down.}
<A>__{billy turns colin around and puts the pistol to colin's forehead, hard enough to break the skin. he takes out colin's belt gun and puts it in his pocket. (billy screams "hands!" at colin every time he makes a move).}
<C>__{colin }
<D>__{i came here to talk some fucking sense to you. you get a hold of yourself and put down the fuckin' firearm and act professional and i can get you your money.}

<A>__{billy cracks him across the jaw with the gun. colin goes down. colin is drooling blood, his bell rung, one eye open. billy throws away colin's ankle gun.}

<D>__{i don't give a fuck if these charges don't stick.}
<P>__{(whaling him in the beats)}
<D>__{but i'm still fucking arresting you.}
<A>__{colin is hammered to his knees. head down, blood in his hair, drooling blood, thinking (impossibly) about his next move. he seems to realize he's fucked.}
<C>__{billy }
<D>__{[you are what you do.] get up.}
<P>__{(colin doesn't move.)}
<D>__{i said get the fuck up.}
<A>__{billy grabs the back of colin's collar and puts the gun to colin's head. a crunch of gravel, off. billy and colin both hear it.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{put down the weapon and step away from sergeant sullivan.}
<A>__{billy drags colin to his feet and using colin as a shield aims the pistol at: brown. brown is aiming his weapon.}
