<L>__{interior stifler's house day}
<A>__{the next morning. the party is long over. plastic beer cups and various bottles litter the house, but it's not trashed. jim is wandering around in a daze, holding his head. he stumbles over a body. it's kevin.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{ow, what the hell?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{sorry, i thought you were dead.}
<A>__{they walk over to the other side of the room. finch is sitting on the couch.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{good morning gentleman.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{finch! where were you last night? what happened to the foolproof plan?}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{i thought a fashionably late entrance would enhance my appearance.}
<P>__{(off their looks)}
<D>__{when i got here, the bacchanalia was over and the nymphs had left.}
<A>__{oz wanders in, still sullen. takes a seat, sulking.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{feeling better, oz?}
<C>__{oz}
<D>__{i'm such a loser.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{that's the spirit.}
<A>__{we hear footsteps coming down the stairs. it's the central girl. she wears a "central" sweatshirt. sherman follows behind her. the guys watch in disbelief as sherman and the girl speak hushed, intimately.}
<C>__{sherman}
<P>__{(snippets of conversation)}
<D>__{...i will never forget...thank you.}
<A>__{the central girl smiles. notices the other guys watching. just gives sherman a kiss on the cheek.}
<C>__{central girl}
<D>__{bye.}
<A>__{she exits. the guys are dumbfounded. jaws hang. sherman looks triumphant. strides over to the guys.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you did it.}
<C>__{sherman}
<D>__{fellas, say goodbye to chuck sherman, the boy. i am now a man.}
<A>__{the guys are shocked and amazed.}
<C>__{sherman }
<D>__{i highly recommend you join the club.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{i i don't get it, how the hell did you do that?}
<C>__{sherman}
<D>__{it was just my time, fellas, it was just my time. best of luck to you, boys.}
<A>__{sherman exits. silence. the guys look like they just lost the world series on errors. they slowly take seats, ruined.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{i put in months of quality time with vicky. sherman meets a chick for one night and scores? this is just wrong.}
<C>__{oz}
<D>__{no shit, i'm never gonna get laid. how the hell am i gonna become this mr. sensitive man?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{jesus, we're all gonna go to college as virgins. they've probably got special dorms for people like us.}
<A>__{a long beat as they give this serious consideration. then, kevin strides purposefully to the front of the group.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{alright, i got an idea. but it stays between us. agreed?}
<A>__{they do.}
<C>__{kevin }
<D>__{okay. it's really simple. we make an agreement no wait, more than an agreement.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{like a bet?}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{no, a pact . no money involved. this is more important than any bet. now here's the deal: we all get laid before we graduate.}
<A>__{a beat}
<C>__{oz}
<D>__{dude, it's not like i haven't been trying to get laid.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{this is different. this is better. think of when you're working out, oz. you need a partner, someone to spot you. someone to keep you motivated.}
<A>__{oz nods, getting into it. kevin smiles and continues, arms outspread.}
<C>__{kevin }
<D>__{that's what we are, we keep each other on track. prior to this day, we've postured. we've procrastinated. we've pretended. we've well i can't think of other p words, but we've probably done them too.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{pontificated.}
<C>__{kevin}
<P>__{(ignoring him)}
<D>__{separately, we are flawed and vulnerable. but together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(kung fu voice)}
<D>__{their tiger style kung fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!}
<C>__{oz}
<P>__{(going on)}
<D>__{the sha lin masters from east and west must unite!}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{guys, guys you're ruining my fucking moment here. now think about it }
<A>__{kevin jumps up on a chair.}
<C>__{kevin }
<D>__{no longer will our penises remain flaccid and unused! from now on, we fight for every man out there who isn't getting laid when he should be! this is our day! this is our time! and, by god, we're not gonna let history condemn us to celibacy! we will make a stand! we will succeed! we will get laid !}
<A>__{kevin jumps down off the chair, and puts his hand out in front of him. one by one, the guys pile their hands on top, in between them it's a pact! they break with a cheer. woo hoo!}
<C>__{stifler}
<P>__{(wandering down from upstairs)}
<D>__{what the hell are you losers doing?}
<A>__{they all stop. stifler has a toothbrush hanging from his mouth. a goatee of dried toothpaste.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{if i might ask, when you brush your teeth, do you spit or swallow?}
<A>__{stifler tries to give a retort to finch, but turns green and heads back upstairs.}
