<D>__{finish what?}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{...i think the whole process would have taken an hour... maybe more. and then i suppose both would have changed back to dog form.}

<D>__{well, that thing in the ice sure weren't no dog.}
<C>__{blair}
<P>__{(impatient)}
<D>__{of course not... but whatever it was revived, it... well, the thing was probably disoriented... and realized it couldn't survive for long in our atmosphere... but being the incredibly adaptable creature it was... it tried to become something that could... before the norwegians killed it... it somehow got to this dog.}

<D>__{what do you mean "got" to the dog?}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{it was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell.}

<D>__{you're saying... that big muther in the ice, became the dog.}
<C>__{blair}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{i think we're talking about an organism... that could imitate other life forms... perfectly... it could have gone on and on... it could have become one dog... it could have become as many dogs as it wanted to and without losing any of its original mass...}

<D>__{so what's our problem?}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{well... there's still some cell activity... it's not entirely dead yet.}
