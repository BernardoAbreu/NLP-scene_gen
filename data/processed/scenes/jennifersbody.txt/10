<L>__{exterior jennifer check's house moments later}
<A>__{three police cars squeal up to the curb with sirens and lights engaged. officer roman duda, 22, a muscular young cop, jogs authoritatively toward the house. he shakes his head, dumbfounded.}
<C>__{roman}
<D>__{christ, needy, what have you done?}
<L>__{interior police squad car dawn}
<A>__{needy, innocent looking in pigtails, is hustled into the back of the squad car. her clothes and face are smeared with blood. officer duda starts the ignition. his partner, a hard faced female cop, slides into the front seat. her cap is pushed back to accommodate a huge round pouf of shellacked mall bangs.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{hi, roman! how's the force treating you? i like that jaunty cap. blue like your balls.}
<C>__{roman}
<D>__{how could you do this, needy?}
<P>__{(emotional)}
<D>__{you killed jen jennifer i mean, the victim. are you on something?}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{everything's going to be okay now. i rule.}
<C>__{female cop}
<D>__{shut your mouth back there!}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{hey. didn't you used to baby sit me in like 1998? when my mom worked the overnight at hormel?}
<A>__{the female cop fidgets uncomfortably.}
<C>__{needy }
<D>__{yeah. gracie, right? gracie. i really like your hair, gracie. how many cans of salon selectives did it take to erect that monument?}
<A>__{the cop reaches into the backseat and slaps needy, who hiccups with laughter.}
<C>__{needy }
<D>__{watch it, puffy combs. that's police brutality!}
<C>__{female cop}
<D>__{you're one to talk about brutality, ms. lesnicki. you're looking at attempted murder.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{ugh, don't say attempted. that sounds so jv. small time. teeny weeny, just like officer duda up there. and trust me i'd know.}
<A>__{roman swallows nervously, eyes on the road. officer warzak glances at him.}
<C>__{needy }
<D>__{let's get our facts straight: i successfully committed a hard core, fully premeditated murder back there. i fucking destroyed that brat, ok? i, needy lesnicki, put a stop payment on jennifer check.}
<A>__{she slumps down in the backseat.}
<C>__{needy }
<D>__{why am i even in these cuffs? i just saved every guy in this town from becoming satan chow. i'm a hero.}
<C>__{female cop}
<D>__{she's delirious.}
<C>__{roman}
<P>__{(muttering)}
<D>__{this is going to be a circus.}
<C>__{female cop}
<D>__{at least we've already got a confession.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{confessions are for pussies. you've got a declaration, grace.}
<A>__{she giggles maniacally. roman turns on the radio, violating protocol. it's a soaring rock anthem the same song we heard being piped into solitary confinement. both cops brighten when they hear the song. roman cranks the volume.}
<C>__{roman}
<D>__{god, i love this song.}
<C>__{female cop}
<D>__{i know. and they've done so much for this town.}
<C>__{roman}
<D>__{they're way more than a band, really. they're heroes.}
<C>__{female cop}
<D>__{wait, this is my favorite part...}
<A>__{roman and the female cop begin to sing along with the uplifting, corny song:}
<C>__{female cop and roman}
<P>__{(in unison)}
<D>__{"through the trees, i will find you. heal the ruins left inside you. and the stars will remind you, that you are home..."}
<A>__{needy stares out the window at the sun creeping up over the forest on the horizon.}
<C>__{needy v.o.}
<D>__{so i killed her. whatever. it won't undo anything. three pulses three lives all stopped cold by adolescent bloodlust. it's hard to believe that just two months ago, me, jennifer and my boyfriend chip were completely normal people.}
<C>__{needy v.o. }
<D>__{we were our yearbook pictures. nothing more, nothing less.}
<A>__{we see a brief montage of black and white yearbook stills: jennifer executing the splits on a football field, her smile bright. needy inspecting a school newspaper layout, pen in hand, glasses on her nose. and finally, chip dove, playing a strap on snare drum at a school pep rally, his head bent in concentration....}
<C>__{needy v.o. }
<D>__{jesus, chip..}
<A>__{the photo fades into the pep rally itself. chip is animated, drumming in full color...}
