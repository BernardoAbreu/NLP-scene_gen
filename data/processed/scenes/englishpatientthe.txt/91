<L>__{78. exterior the desert. day.}
<A>__{almasy, kamal and two of the other young bedouin stand around the mess of the two broken vehicles. the one working car is loaded with men and provisions. katharine sits inside, next to madox, almasy comes over to her window, to speak past her to madox.}
<C>__{madox}
<D>__{i will be back as quick as i can. thirty six hours at the outside.}
<C>__{almasy}
<D>__{try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the pottery hill. and a better jack. we planned badly.}
<C>__{madox}
<P>__{(nods at almasy, then shouts over}
<A>__{to the wrecked vehicles)}
<D>__{bermann!}
<A>__{this is bermann's cue to take leave of kamal who is staying behind. kamal makes a little bow.}
<C>__{kamal}
<D>__{may god make safety your companion.}
<A>__{bermann nods and hurries away, squeezing into the car which jolts off, bouncing over the track. the vehicle gets about twenty yards, almasy watching, before it sinks forlornly into the soft sand. it's hopelessly overloaded with people.}
<B>__{they all get out.}
<C>__{katharine}
<D>__{i shall stay behind, of course}
<C>__{madox}
<D>__{certainly not.}
<C>__{katharine}
<D>__{i insist. there clearly isn't room for us all, i'm the least able to dig, and i'm not one of the walking wounded. those are facts. besides, if i remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us.}
<A>__{it's hard to argue with this logic. almasy shrugs. later the madox car makes a more effective departure. and almasy and katharine are left alone. they look at each other as if realizing this for the first time. almasy immediately returns to the two damaged vehicles and helps the men stretch the cut canvas which was once a tent to fashion a makeshift shelter between the two cars. katharine goes to join them. there is no obstacle to the remorseless horizon, just miles of undulating dunes.}
