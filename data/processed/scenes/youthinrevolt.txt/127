<L>__{interior girls' dorm hallway night}
<A>__{an empty hall. the sneaky strings of night on bald mountain. sheeni rounds the corner at the far end. as she and heather sneak the boys down, the other occupants of the floor giggle in french and dart from door to door in near undress.}
<L>__{interior sheeni's dorm room night}
<A>__{a cement cubicle just big enough for a bunk bed, two small desks, an army surplus dresser, and a stuffed armchair. sheeni pulls a nightgown from the dresser.}

<D>__{lefty, should maybe sleep in my room. it's pretty crowded in here.}
<C>__{lefty}
<D>__{your roommate won't mind?}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{oh, darlene went home for the weekend.}
<A>__{lefty gulps and picks up his grip. he pauses in the hallway.}
<C>__{lefty}
<D>__{well, see you guys in the morning.}
<A>__{the door closes and vijay and nick exchange a knowing glance.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{pardon me, everyone.}
<A>__{sheeni steps into the tiny closet to change. vijay and nick regard the... wall of taggarty's conquests a series of mug shots of sullen looking teenage boys. most of them have been given a grade of c or below.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{there's your competition.}
<C>__{vijay}
<D>__{a distinguished group i would be happy to join.}
<A>__{the two boys turn around and watch in hot blooded bliss as taggarty searches for her misplaced nightie.}
