<L>__{interior coffee bar. day}
<D>__{jenny and two school friends, hattie and tina, are sitting at a table in a typical late 50s coffee bar, sipping cappuccinos. jenny is easily the most attractive of the three and also, we will see, possibly the cleverest. hattie is slower than the other two, and a lot frumpier; tina is pretty, and sharp rather than clever. she is also the least middle class of the three she's clearly a scholarship girl. they are all dressed in an unflattering and unambiguous school uniform no attempts to disguise it with more fashionable accessories. jenny is smoking pretentiously, and seems to be practising some kind of pout. tina starts to slurp the froth from her cappuccino with a spoon, inelegantly and noisily. jenny tuts her disapproval. tina sighs, and puts her spoon down.}

<D>__{we still don't have to like him.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{camus doesn't want you to like him. what he's trying to say is that feeling is bourgeois. being engagee is bourgeois. his mother dies and he doesn't feel anything. he kills this arab and he doesn't feel anything.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{i wouldn't feel anything if my mother died. does that make me an existentialist?}

<D>__{no. that just makes you a cow.}
