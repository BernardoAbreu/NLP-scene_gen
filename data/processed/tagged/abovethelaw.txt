<L>__{exterior jungle late afternoon}
<A>__{nico in the point, leading fox and the three cit (chemical interrogation team) men down an unmarked, twisting trail. we see from nico's gait that he is athletic, a born leader and totally at home in the jungle. trail late afternoon snakes along a ridge line, high enough to give us a view and let us know these guys are way out in the boonies.}
<C>__{zagon}
<D>__{how long till we're across the border?}

<C>__{nico}
<D>__{i don't trust these yo yo's.}
<A>__{full shot base camp we see nico moving like a shadow from one defensive position to another, checking the perimeter. we can vaguely hear him rousting the cambodian lookouts, speaking in dialect. defensive position nico hears a sound, looks back toward the hooch. nico's pov hooch two asian prisoners, stripped to the waist, babbling in coherently, are dragged out the back by a pair of cambodian guards and hustled off into the darkness. voices can be heard inside the hooch. a single lantern glowing inside gives the hut a creepy, frightening aspect.}
<B>__{back to nico}
<A>__{he's extremely uneasy about what's about to happen inside the hooch.}
<L>__{interior hooch close on rickety card table night}

<B>__{nico}
<A>__{enters at this pointerior he takes in the scene quickly, moves to a spot beside the entrance. zagon doesn't look at nico, but it's plain he is aware of nico's presence. it is as if he wants to prove something to this muscular kid and prove it to the others, too.}
<B>__{first prisoner}
<A>__{dies in agony on the ground.}
<B>__{second prisoner}
<A>__{watches with eyes like flinterior he is in his mid forties, scarred, missing several fingers. probably a colonel or higher, he looks like he's been fighting these round eyes since the french in the 50's. he is plainly one tough customer. the second prisoner meets zagon's eyes, as if daring him to use the drugs on him, too. zagon eyes the prisoner with barely contained hatred. the prisoner doesn't back down an inch.}
<C>__{zagon}
<P>__{(to second prisoner)}
<D>__{so my little doctor bag doesn't scare you, eh? well i don't need it to open your yap.}
<A>__{zagon reaches to a scabbard on his western belt, pulls out a fearsome serrated blade a cross between a bowie knife and a scalpel. he steps toward the prisoner, displaying the blade in the lantern light.}

<A>__{watches impassively.}
<C>__{zagon }
<P>__{(to prisoner)}
<D>__{where's our load, you sack of slime? what did you do with my shit? }
<B>__{zagon}
<A>__{punches the prisoner full in the face, holding the knife handle in his fist to double the force of the blow and to terrify him with the proximity of the blade. the prisoner crashes sideways, face bloody }

<D>__{i'm gonna teach you good. i'm gonna teach you never to fuck with my opium }
<B>__{fox and two cit men}
<A>__{seem to know exactly what this is about.}
<B>__{nico}
<A>__{didn't know, but the new kid on the block is catching on fast. nico has difficulty containing his emotion. zagon stands over the prisoner, as if daring him to get back up. the prisoner gets back to his knees, bloody eyes meeting zagon's with defiance }
<C>__{zagon}
<P>__{(to prisoner)}
<D>__{you're a hard nigger, aren't you, boy? you took it from the chinks... you took it from the french. you'll be fucked if some yankee peckerwood's gonna start your gums flapping }

<C>__{zagon}
<P>__{(to second prisoner)}
<D>__{i'm gonna start carving at your ankles. we'll throw your feet in that box right over there. then i'm gonna take off your arms }
<A>__{one of the cit men yanks the prisoner's leg forward, clamping it to the ground with his hands. the prisoner still hasn't flinched. he seems as locked into this dance of death as zagon.}

<C>__{fox}
<D>__{shut up, nico.}
<C>__{zagon}
<D>__{you can disappear as easy as this slope, kid }
<A>__{zagon starts for the prisoner. here comes the blade. suddenly nico grabs zagon's shoulder. zagon spins with terrifying quickness, cocking the blade to slash at nico. before zagon's blow even starts, nico slams him with a ferocious elbow shot right under the jaw. zagon literally comes off the ground, nico's blow is so terrific. zagon drops in an unconscious heap. in a flash the two other cit men move to jump nico. smash! the second cit man is swallowing his teeth. fox leaps in the way of the third, shoves nico out of the hooch }

<D>__{ i will fix it! get out! get the fuck outa here!}
<A>__{the cit man calls out to the cambodian troops, in dialect, pointing at nico. the soldiers start toward nico, as if to seize him. fox, too, starts yelling to the troops in dialect, apparently countermanding the orders of the cit men. the troops, confused, hold up for a moment.}
<C>__{fox}
<P>__{(to nico)}
<D>__{i will call for a chopper... get outa here!}
