<D>__{it begins with a single nano cell planted in the motor cortex of the brain this cell can replicate, replacing the cells `round it with perfect copies...}
<A>__{we see a cartoon image of a tiny nano cell labeled with a bold, block letter n. the nano cell approaches a normal cell next to it... there is a flash; now the cell next to it has turned into an exact copy of the nano. this continues, multiplying exponentially, until we zoom back to reveal that the entire brain has been converted to nano cells.}
<C>__{ken castle }
<D>__{... these copied cells contain remote access functionality. therefore, nano plus cortex equals the nanex.}
<A>__{the graphic zooms back further to show a pair of hands working a retro atari style joystick... animated waves indicate a wireless transmission from the joystick to the slayer, who unfreezes and flies into action.}

<A>__{castle waves in his personal security: a half dozen geeks in black jeans, black t shirts w white socks and sneakers; backpacks... yes, even fanny packs. a full range of geek variations: beard mustache combos, thick glasses, pony tails, etc. one geek brings out the cutest, softest little spaniel puppy in the world and places it in castle's lap. meanwhile several others are directing handheld sensors at gina and thumb clicking to establish tracking points her slightest movements are scanned and interpreted as data in real time.}
