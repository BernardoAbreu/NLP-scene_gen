<A>__{colonel lee leans out and shoots javal's rear tires out. the van drives erratically, held in its lane by bumping against the cars around it. carson pulls up closer... suddenly, the rear doors of the van burst open... and javal flies out, riding a motorcycle. he's got the money stuffed into two big, chaps sized saddlebags slung over the back of the machine. he straddles the lanes, going against traffic, riding like a maniac back the way he came. carson watches him in the rear view... and speeds up, driving away from him.}

<D>__{turn around!}
<A>__{but carson hugs the shoulder, moving through the heavy traffic, until he spots what he was looking for: the biker club, riding in formation up ahead. carson cuts in front of them and slams on the brakes. he jumps out and grabs one of the biker's machines by the handlebars, wrestling it to a stop. while pulling its burly owner off it:}

<D>__{fbi. call our office, they'll take care of you.}
<A>__{meanwhile, the other bikers have come to help their friend. they pull guns, knives, chains... they're stopped by sabatini, who appears holding her mp 5 machine pistol. the biker yells at carson as he drives way:}

<A>__{gets in the driver's seat of the mercedes and turns it around.}
<B>__{javal}
<A>__{continues down the freeway on his bike, straddling lanes, driving the wrong way, retracing his route back to highland, leaving car horns, cursing, and collisions in his wake.}
<B>__{wider}
<A>__{when everyone thinks they've seen it all, here comes another mad biker carson riding against traffic in pursuit.}
