<D>__{maybe it's the most important building block that we have to begin again... we start from the beginning each time and i feel today as if i'm starting from the beginning. we'll just keep asking each other questions, and don't look to me for the answers, okay?}
<A>__{on cue, young guido opens the door behind him and ushers in the cast of guido's life. they enter with a sense of anticipation and excitement and arrange themselves on the staircases and scaffolding that loom behind guido. they are all dressed in angelic white. but guido is oblivious, focused instead on the task that lies ahead. he talks to his cameraman. puts down his script. he takes off his jacket and hangs his glasses off his sweater, stands contemplating the set in front of him.}

<A>__{a long wide pan reveals a tableau vivant looming behind guido like a glorious choir, his every muse, his every inspiration. they watch him as he begins to work. a part of him now and forever. guido sits on the crane. the soundstage door opens, and we see a small figure slip quietly onto the set. tentatively, she steps through the shadows. it's luisa. from a discreet distance, she watches her husband return to his gift. pierpaolo calls for silence.}
