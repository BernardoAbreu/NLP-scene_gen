<A>__{chris labors up the riverbank with his water jug full. he is shirtless and absolutely emaciated. frightening. he pauses at the river's edge to take air into his lungs. it's all he can do just to breath. wide angle tableau (continuous): chris standing at the river's edge catching his breath framed against the background of the 3000 foot butte that he'd so recently climbed with ease. now, maintaining this tableau, something moves from near camera right into frame. bit by bit we'll realize it's a large bear entering frame and moving away from camera toward chris. it lumbers to within feet of him. cu over bear onto chris: chris, passive to the bear's presence. angle: the bear, just as passive towards chris, as though he didn't represent enough of anything to eat. back to tableau as the bear, passing chris, disappears over the rise toward the river. chris, a motionless and slight silhouette.}
