<L>__{interior roy's apartment kitchen night}
<A>__{sara's on the phone, unwrapping one of those t.v. dinners.}
<C>__{sara}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{it was so... slamming, lindsay. the dancing! i'm going again. what? no, i haven't seen anybody get shot yet. god, i didn't move to bosnia.}
<L>__{interior patterson high hallway morning}
<A>__{a fight. two black girls having at it. it's a ferocious match. hair pulling, spit flying, punches landed, clothes torn apart.}
<B>__{angle on sara}
<A>__{as she crowns the corner, comes to a bottleneck of students. it's like the nose bleed section of caesar's palace. the far hallway is the ring. sara cranes her neck to see the action. angle widens as a security guard earns his hazard pay. he separates the two girls who are still swinging at each other. he throws one into a corner, hurls the other in an opposite corner.}
<B>__{on sara}
<A>__{as a white girl standing next to her shakes her head lamentably.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{what happened?}
<A>__{the white girl studies sara's suburban clothes and fresh scrubbed face. thinks she found a kindred spirit.}
<C>__{tony }
<D>__{we freed the slaves and didn't teach them no manners.}
<P>__{(before sara can react)}
<D>__{you're sara, right?}
<P>__{(as sara warily nods)}
<D>__{toni. i was gonna introduce myself before but you're always with that crowd. you know. chenille, her girls, that identity crisis diggy.}
<A>__{sara looks at toni. getting it. getting her. the expression on her face closes off. toni, too dense to read it, keeps talking.}
<C>__{toni}
<P>__{(brightly)}
<D>__{we should hang out sometime, sara. the two of us. whenever you decide to lose the tan?}
<A>__{her inference clear, toni flashes a brilliant smile, happily walks off. sara shakes her head to herself. what an idiot. as sara continues down the hall, a p.a. address comes on.}
<C>__{p.a. address }
<D>__{seniors, a reminder before you rise up and change the world. mrs. gwynn is holding all diplomas hostage in her office. her only demand is the pleasure of your company for career d day. be there.}
<A>__{sara enters her classroom, a bunch of kids in front of and behind her.}
