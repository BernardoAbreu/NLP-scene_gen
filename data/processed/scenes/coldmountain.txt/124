<L>__{exterior swanger farm. dusk}
<A>__{ada and ruby, riding together on the horse, arrive at the swangers. sally is still pinned under the fence post. the noose around her neck has been tied off to the post so that she can't move. there's a bloody sheet draped over the edge of the well. blood on the ground. ruby heaves at the fence.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{i can't get this damn thing off her.}
<C>__{ada}
<P>__{(at the well, looking down)}
<D>__{dear lord in heaven.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{ada, i can't get this off her!}
<A>__{ada runs over. they struggle, can't lift it. sally's lips are moving.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{what darling? what?}
<A>__{she bends down, listens to her. looks up at ada.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{she's saying don't bother.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{wait!}
<A>__{she grabs a thick log off the stack, staggers back and in a second they've inserted it into the fence and levered it up and away from sally's hands. they fall back onto the dirt. ruby cradles sally. ada nods towards the well.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{there's someone down there. i think it's esco.}
<A>__{ruby looks over at the well, then at ada.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{this world won't stand long. god won't let it stand this way long.}
