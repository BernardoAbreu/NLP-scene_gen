<C>__{brody}
<D>__{ohhhh. . .}
<A>__{kazim gestures with his gun toward the now unconscious brody. the other two men take brody's hands and drag him into one of the book lined aisles.}
<L>__{interior another part of the catacombs day}
<A>__{decomposing corpses rest in niches carved into the stone walls. grotesque skeletal remains with rotting linen stretched across blackened bones. indy holds the lighter up as he and elsa inspect symbols carved into the walls. elsa spots a symbol cut into the wall that she doesn't recognize. as she blows away some cobwebs:}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{what's this one?}
<A>__{indy only has to give it a quick glance to know.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{the ark of the covenant.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{are you sure?}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(deadpan)}
<D>__{pretty sure.}
<A>__{indy holds the lighter up and he and elsa enter another dark passageway.}
<B>__{another part of the catacombs}
<A>__{indy steps to the wall and runs his hand over the stone. he scrapes the cobwebs away to reveal the roman numeral "x."}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{watch out.}
<A>__{elsa now holds the lighter as indy rams his shoulder into the wall. the wall collapses on impact and indy falls through into another room. another room the catacombs as indy falls through the hole in the wall onto rocks surrounded by bubbling, green, slimy liquid. more skeletons surround him, resting in their carved niches. elsa holds the lighter as she peers in at him through the hole in the wall.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{petroleum. i could sink a well down here and retire.}
<A>__{indy reaches up and tears a piece of cloth from one of the skeletons, which breaks apart and falls into the oil slick water. indy uses the scrap of cloth and a bone to fashion a crude torch, which he then dips into the oily water.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{give me the lighter.}
<B>__{another part of the catacombs}
<A>__{using the cloth wrapped bone torch to guide their way, indy and elsa come upon a narrow passageway. the water is knee deep and teeming with rats. thousands of them crawling on one another's backs. squealing. squirming. thrashing in the water.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{oh, rats...}
<A>__{elsa gasps as the rats scamper between her legs. indy moves forward through the rat infested water as elsa follows, still gasping in horror. suddenly he slips into a hole. recovering his balance, he reaches out to elsa.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{come onl}
<A>__{she gasps once again, terrified. indy lifts her and carries elsa as he moves forward. the catacombs the hole in the wall kazim and his men step to the opening indy made earlier and shine their flashlights through to the rat infested water.}
<B>__{another part of the catacombs}
<A>__{more rat infested water as elsa, now walking again, follows indy through another passageway lined with skulls and bones. indy reaches for a wall to steady himself and inadvertently grabs a skeleton. a bone comes loose in his hand as rats scurry about and leap at him from all directions. he takes a moment to compose himself, then steps across the water to elsa's side. he steps into the water, then reaches up to help elsa do the same.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{come here.}
<B>__{large burial chamber}
<A>__{the chamber is flooded with black, briny water.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{look. . .}
<A>__{in the center of the chamber, jutting up above the water, is what amounts to an "island altar" on which several ancient coffins rest. they move toward the altar. indy and elsa begin to inspect the ornately carved coffins like the scholars of antiquity that they are. these are big oak caskets held together by straps of etched brass.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{it must be one of these...}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.}
<A>__{one coffin is elevated above the others.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{it's this one.}
<A>__{together they begin to push on the lidstraining and groaning until it slides away and bangs against the stone platform.}
<B>__{inside the coffin}
<A>__{lie the decomposed remains of a knight in armor. indy and elsa look in...elsa gasps.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{this is itl we found it! look the engraving on the shield. it's the same as on the grail tablets the shield is the second marker!}
<A>__{indy unfolds a piece of paper and holds it over the shield.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{it's a rubbing dad made of the grail tablet.}
<A>__{the missing portion of the rubbing is completed by the shield.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{just like your fathergiddy as a schoolboy.}
<A>__{indy laughs.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(chuckles)}
<D>__{he never would have made it past the rats! he hates rats! he's scared to death of them!}
<A>__{close a hand as it lights a match. pull back to reveal kazim dropping the lighted match into the oil slick water.}
<B>__{indy and elsa}
<A>__{elsa holds the torch. indy looks around. listens. something is wrong. and then he sees the glow of firelight dancing across the catacomb walls. this is followed by thousands of rats fleeing from around the corner of the narrow passageway, stampeding toward elsa and indyshrieking and squealing as they approach. the rats literally wash over themlike a rodent tidal wavein their efforts to escape a:}
<B>__{huge orange ball of fire}
<A>__{roaring around the corner hurtling towards themfeeding on the oil slick; consuming the oxygen.}
<B>__{elsa screams.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{get back! back against the wall.}
<A>__{indy braces his back against the altar and topples the coffin with his feet. it crashes against the stone platform and splashes into the water.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{quick! under it!}
<A>__{they jump into the water beside the bobbing, overturned coffin.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{air pocket!}
<A>__{elsa hesitates. indy literally dunks her and pushes her underneath.}
<B>__{under the coffin}
<A>__{elsa surfaces into the air pocket created by the coffin, sputtering and}

<A>__{now indy pops up into the air pocket. he looks at elsathey are both soaking wet.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{don't wander off.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{indy disappears under the water and swims out from under the coffin.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{what?}
<B>__{under the water}
<A>__{indy swims, looking for an escape route.}
<B>__{under the coffin}
<A>__{the rats are beginning to force their way inside, swimming through the water and climbing on elsa, who squirms and screams in terror. indy pops back up through the water.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{i think i've found a way out. deep breath.}
<A>__{elsa groans. they take a deep breath and both dive under the water.}
