<L>__{interior restaurant night}
<A>__{the fanciest one in d.c. the entire eight person team sits around a round table, drunk and laughing, as the last champagne flute is filled. sebastian raises his glass.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{to the finest research team i've ever known.}
<A>__{a round of "hear, hears" and they all clink glasses and drink.}
<L>__{exterior restaurant balcony later}
<A>__{the din of the diners fades away as linda slips out onto the restaurant's balcony. she find sebastian leaning against a railing, breathing in the night air.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{hey...}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{i thought you'd gone.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{where would i go?}
<A>__{he looks out over the sweep of the city, the twinkling lights of d.c. and darkness of the potomac river.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{twenty years ago there were no computers, no fax machines, no cell phones. i was just wondering what the world will be like twenty years from now... if what we're doing will change everything.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{a little "i am become death... the shatterer of worlds"?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{something like that.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{since the day i met, all you wanted to do was change the world.}
<A>__{she puts her hand on his shoulder.}
<C>__{linda }
<D>__{listen, i know we've... i mean... well ... i just want you to know how proud i am of you. i know it probably doesn't mean a lot...}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{actually it does.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i guess since you were there from the beginning, you know me better than anyone else on this godforsaken planet.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{you're positively maudlin. you should be happy. do you have any idea what you've accomplished?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{yeah... but i was working so hard, i didn't realize i'd have no one to share it with.}
<A>__{sebastian heads back inside. but he stops and turns back.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{i don't suppose we could turn back the clock for a night and you could come home with me?}
<A>__{her look says it all. too much water under the bridge.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{right. sorry. too much champagne.}
<A>__{he turns and heads back into the party. as he heads in he passes matt heading out. he and sebastian exchange "heys".}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{what was that about?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{nothing. it's just... he is who he is. sometimes i just have to be reminded.}
