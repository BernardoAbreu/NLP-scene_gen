<A>__{by the time the binoculars are up, another truck has crossed from the left. in momentarily blocks out the side of our freight truck. by the time the two trucks part, we can only see the back half of the freight truck before it pulls out of sight. jeff is only able to read the words "freight lines". the binoculars are held for a moment until we see a puffing and blowing stella arrive at the opening of the alleyway. she looks toward the front of thorwald's apartment house. and by her attitude we can see that there is no truck outside. she looks about her for a moment.}
