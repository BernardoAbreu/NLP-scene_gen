<L>__{interior kendo souvenirs day}
<A>__{the place is huge, ramshackle, loaded with every piece of tourist crap imaginable. the only paintings on display are renderings of big cats on black velvet. she winds her way through, to a counter at the back. one guy there...}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{may i please speak with mr. okati.}
<C>__{okati}
<D>__{you doin' it.}
<A>__{the best we can say for the pudgy, balding fellow in the hawaiian shirt and spectacularly baggy trousers, is that he does not seem to be the guy who is selling you a monet. even a minor one.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{i think there's some mista...}
<C>__{okati}
<D>__{you from mac?}
<A>__{she stops. jesus. the guy coughs horribly.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{i'm from mac.}
<C>__{okati}
<D>__{lemme see card.}
<A>__{she hesitates.}
<C>__{okati}
<D>__{four million, six hundred thirteen thousand, five hundred?}
<A>__{wow. he slaps his hand on the table. lay it down, toots.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{you first.}
<A>__{he shrugs. lifts straight up, from beneath the counter... ...a brown paper wrapped rectangle. not much larger than two feet square. she can't even believe she's here, doing this. gestures to him. open it up! he obliges, coughing grossly all the while. unwrapped, the painting does look like a monet. from here. she stares at it.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{now bring me the real one.}
<A>__{he doesn't blink.}
<C>__{okati}
<D>__{this as real as it gets, lady.}
<A>__{and from within her pocket. the cellular rings. she takes it out. puts it to her ear.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{you got it?}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{is this an audition, a joke, or a rip off? i'm staring at an obvious forgery, here.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{turn it over.}
<A>__{this gives her pause. then, cradling the phone against her shoulder, she does as she's told. to see...}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{is there an envelope? taped to the back? in a ziploc bag?}
<A>__{sure is.}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{detach the bag. read what's in it. aloud.}
<A>__{she does. carefully unfolding several sheets of paper, maps...}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{shikoku naru, a freighter, it says, yokohama to jakarta...dates, statistics...specs on some kind of machine, diag...}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{papers back in the envelope, envelope back in the ziploc, very quickly, without seeming to hurry...}
<A>__{her eyes are flickering questions, but she does as she's told, cradling the phone with her shoulder.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{now take the debit card from your purse, slipping the ziploc into the purse as you do it, shielding the move from everyone in the room but okati.}
<A>__{and she does. more deftly than we could ever have imagined. like a pro.}
<P>__{mac (o.s., quietly)}
<D>__{give him the card.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{mac, the painting's a forg...}
<P>__{mac (o.s., even quieter)}
<D>__{this is a test. of whether you'll still be alive four minutes from now. do you hear me?}
<A>__{her face freezes. in a pleasant smile.}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{yes, mac, i do.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{now. hand him the card, and tell him in japanese to pretend he is checking it by phone. tell him to take awhile, as if he's on hold.}
<A>__{she turns the sweet plastic smile to okati. hands him the card...}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{mac says, pretend you're checking this by phone, and take your ti...}
<C>__{okati }
<D>__{...like i'm on hold, sure.}
<A>__{and suddenly, his eyes are keen and quick, and he is no longer some schmuck in baggy pants. he takes the card, stares at it comically, picks up the phone.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{while he's checking, look around the room casually, as if searching for the cheesy handbags...}
<A>__{she begins to.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{all the while laughing, as if you are chatting with someone you actually like .}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{i'm not that good.}
<A>__{but she is. and she laughs, as she strolls over to the cheesy handbags.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{as you're looking around, do you notice any m...}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{three guys, two together, one alone. cheap suits, not looking at me in a cop casual way.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{call out cheerily to okati, in english, 'where's the toilet?'}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{can i say, 'little girl's room'?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{wing it.}
<P>__{gin (calls out, cheerily)}
<D>__{where's the crapper?}
<A>__{okati, absorbed by his make believe phone call, points around the back.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{get going. now.}
<P>__{gin (into phone, as she saunters)}
<D>__{mac, the painting isn't...}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{you've got what we bought, are you out of their sight?}
<A>__{she turns the corner. filthy corridor. restrooms at opposite ends.}
<D>__{mac (o.s.) run into the men's toilet. i know you know how.}
<A>__{a beat of uncertainty. she looks both ways.}
<P>__{mac (o.s., ominous)}
<D>__{are you running ?}
<A>__{and she does. sprinting down the garbage strewn hallway, throws open the men's room door, bursting in on... ...a wispy old guy taking a leak through a hole in the floor.}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{get the fuck out of here!}
<A>__{the panicked little man startles. bolts out the door.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{jump.}
<A>__{jump? hear now, from the corridor, footfalls pounding. she looks down through the piss hole. the surf roils thirty feet below.}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{it's too small.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{the window , twit!}
<A>__{oh. she hops over the disgusting hole, boosts herself up to the small window, footfalls racing closer, hoists herself halfway through, dropping the phone a scary 30 feet to the surf below, as behind her, the door... ...slams open and she flies out the window...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{shiiiiiiiiiit...}
<A>__{with her in slo mo, kicking and flailing and grasping her shoulder bag, and she... hits the ocean like a ton of bricks. disappears. comes up, sputtering in the swirling water, as from out of the shadows of the pilings... ...an engine roars to life, the blur of a custom jetski, mac reaching to scoop the startled girl out of the water, and they... ...blast off, as bullets rain helplessly after them. the agents shouting into their cellulars, racing in frustration down the pier, which rapidly vanishes behind us, as... ...gin hangs onto mac for dear life. this baby is really hauling. he wears an orange waterproof slicker with matching trousers. shouts back, against the noise...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{are you pissed off?}
<A>__{she thinks. admits, shouting in his ear...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{actually. it's incredibly cool!}
<A>__{he is heading into deep water, a major shipping channel, points to one side, and she sees... ...a huge harbor patrol vessel fire up in near distance. the chase is on. they speed toward the wake of a luxury liner, and as she realizes...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{oh noooooo...}
<A>__{they slam into the wake head on, and are airborne for an amazing distance, jolting back to the surface, racing toward... ...two gigantic freighters which approach each other from opposite directions. the harbor patrol in hot pursuit, blasting its horn...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{we're gonna die, aren't we?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{just as soon as i'm ready!}
<A>__{as we near the outbound freighter, mac cuts his speed. now the harbor patrol is really gaining.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{faster, not slower, you twit !!}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{have to give them a sporting chance...}
<A>__{cruising straight toward the part side of the outbound freighter, as the inbound freighter begins to pass it on the far side...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{...something we scots learned from the brits!}
<A>__{as the harbor patrol is nearly on them, mac veers suddenly around the stern of the outbound freighter, the harbor patrol wheeling madly to pursue, only to find we are both careening straight at... ...the starboard side of the inbound freighter, mac cuts his wheel in an adroit nearly right angle swerve, and hears the screams as the harbor patrol... plows into the freighter! wasting no time, he accelerates into maximum burn, streaking toward the immensely crowded harbor and its thousand vessels. gin can't help but look back at the impressive crash site, mouthing a silent wow. nearing the harbor, mac cuts speed completely, drifting between two huge ships and... ...vanishing from sight.}
