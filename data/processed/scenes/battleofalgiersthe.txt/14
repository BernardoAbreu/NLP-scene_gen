<L>__{14 small square. casbah. outside. day. january 1956.}
<A>__{it is raining. the water runs along the gulleys of the narrow alleys. the white houses have turned spongy gray. the children of the casbah are playing and spattering mud. skinny and half naked children with bloated bellies and hair cropped because of sores. their mothers call them in vain. they continue to run, play, and wallow in the mud with a despairing gaiety.}
<B>__{calls. voices. shouts.}
<A>__{petit omar was then ten years old. he is slender, dressed in long pants and a jacket which is too large for him and torn so that he seems almost clownish. calm and absorbed, he passes in the midst of the other children, but doesn't notice them or their games. a small square on a sloping ascent. in the center, a fountain. on the elevated side of the square, on a corner, there is a mosque.}
<B>__{sounds of church music.}
<A>__{standing still at the foot of the steps is an algerian in white cloak, and hood down to his eyes. other people pass by. the algerian is turned to one side so as not to be seen. petit omar walks toward him and nears his back. the algerian turns; it is ali la pointe. he tells the boy with a tone of boredom and curtness:}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{go away!}
<C>__{petit omar}
<D>__{men have two faces: one that laughs and one that cries ...}
<A>__{ali looks at him incredulously and asks:}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{and they sent you!}
<A>__{the child slips a hand under his sweater to his chest.}
<C>__{petit omar}
<D>__{sure, something wrong with that?}
<A>__{omar takes out a piece of paper folded in four, and hands it to ali.}
<C>__{petit omar}
<D>__{take it. everything's written here.}
<A>__{he turns away and begins to run.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{wait!}
<A>__{omar stops running and turns to ali.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{come here ... come.}
<A>__{omar retraces his footsteps. ali goes to meet him.}
<C>__{ali}
<P>__{(in a brusque manner)}
<D>__{can you read?}
<C>__{petit omar}
<D>__{sure ...}
<A>__{ali hands back the paper.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{read it.}
<C>__{petit omar}
<D>__{here?}
<A>__{ali turns and looks around him. he squats on his heels in order to reach omar's height.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{it is still drizzling. omar unfolds the paper and begins to read it.}
