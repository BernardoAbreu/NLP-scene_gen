<D>__{'spitfire', hop to it.}
<A>__{blakeney takes command of the gun. to one side calamy is in charge of 'beelzebub', on the other side hollom is now directing 'sudden death'. once again the orders are given, and the crews, now competing with each other, go through the sequence: 'out tompions', 'cast loose your guns', 'cartridge. ball. prime. run out your gun. prime. aim. stand clear... fire!!'}
