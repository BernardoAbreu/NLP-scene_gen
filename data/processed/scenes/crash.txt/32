<L>__{interior james's car day}
<A>__{the car swerves from the fast lane and veers toward an airline coach coming out of the exit ramp. helen quickly shifts to the left of her seat and, pressing her shoulder against james's, closes her hand over james's hand on the wheel. with helen's help, james just manages to pull the car behind the coach. they watch the cars swerving past on both sides of them, horns sounding.}
