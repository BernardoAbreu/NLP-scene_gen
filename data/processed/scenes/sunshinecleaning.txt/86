<L>__{exterior ice cream hut day}
<A>__{rose pays for three soft serve cones and makes her way to the picnic table where norah and oscar wait. norah points to an `apartment for rent' sign on the building across the street. a big bosomed woman sits on the porch with a rabbit in her lap.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{how cool to live across from the ice cream hut.}
<A>__{rose distributes the melty goods.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{you should rent it. seriously, you're making money now.}
<A>__{norah assesses the building. the rabbit lady sees them staring. she waves. rose and norah turn around amused.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{yeah well, what about dad?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{oh please, dad would survive just fine. you should do it.}
<A>__{as norah thinks about a possible move glistening rivulets of chocolate ice cream drip down oscar's cone, over his hand and on to norah's leg.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{ahh! lick around the base. secure the perimeter.}
<P>__{(to rose)}
<D>__{don't you teach this kid anything?}
<A>__{norah demonstrates proper technique. she extends her tongue out to the bottom edge of the dripping glob, then twirls the cone to lick away the troublesome chocolate.}
<C>__{lynn }
<D>__{it's the gorilla girl.}
<A>__{norah looks up to see lynn with a milk shake in hand. an involuntary smile breaks across norah.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{you never came to donate.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{lynn looks at rose. an awkward moment passes.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{my sister.}
<A>__{rose smiles, nods a hi. something familiar about the girl nags at rose. she searches to connect a face out of contexterior lynn eyes norah. chemistry.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{we have snacks you know. juice boxes.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{had i known about the juice boxes...}
<A>__{rose makes the connection her smile drops. lynn picks up on the tension between the two.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{okay. well, see you around.}
<A>__{lynn leaves. rose slaps norah with an accusing look.}
