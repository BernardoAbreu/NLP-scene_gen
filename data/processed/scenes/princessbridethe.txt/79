<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{inigo}
<A>__{walking away. finally he goes back to cliff edge, starts to talk. it's instant death if the man in black falls, but neither gives that possibility much credence. this is our two heroes meeting. they don't know it yet; but that's what it is.}
<C>__{inigo}
<P>__{(hollering down)}
<D>__{hello there.}
<A>__{the man in black glances up, kind of grunts.}
<C>__{inigo}
<D>__{slow going?}
<C>__{man in black}
<D>__{look, i don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. so i'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.}
<C>__{inigo}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{man in black}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{inigo steps away, draws his sword, loosens up with a few perfect thrusts. then resheathes and looks eagerly over the edge again.}
<C>__{inigo}
<D>__{i do not suppose you could speed things up?}
<C>__{man in black}
<P>__{(with some beat)}
<D>__{if you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do.}
<C>__{inigo}
<D>__{i could do that. in fact, i've got some rope up here. but i do not think that you will accept my help, since i am only waiting around to kill you.}
<C>__{man in black}
<D>__{that does put a damper on our relationship.}
<A>__{he finds another bold a few inches higher.}
<C>__{inigo}
<D>__{but i promise i will not kill you until you reach the top.}
<C>__{man in black}
<D>__{that's very comforting. but i'm afraid you'll just have to wait.}
<C>__{inigo}
<D>__{i hate waiting. i could give you my word as a spaniard.}
<C>__{man in black}
<D>__{no good. i've known too many spaniards.}
<A>__{and he just hangs there in space, resting, gathering his strength.}
<C>__{inigo}
<D>__{you don't know any way you'll trust me?}
<C>__{man in black}
<D>__{nothing comes to mind.}
<A>__{and on these words, camera zooms into a close up on inigo. he raises his right hand high, his eyes blaze, and his voice takes on a tone we have not heard before.}
<C>__{inigo}
<D>__{i swear on the soul of my father, domingo montoya, you will reach the top alive.}
