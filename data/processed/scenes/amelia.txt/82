<L>__{exterior garden, rye day}
<A>__{amelia on her knees, tending to her garden. she seems happy and filled with energy. george comes and kneels beside her. starts weeding.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{have i told you what a perfect job you did on the peonies? they're miraculous.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{you have, actually. twice.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{it's all right. you've been distracted lately.}
<A>__{no spin on that. if anything, the tone is kind.}
<P>__{george (contâ€™d)}
<D>__{listen, i've put together a month in europe. close some foreign licensing deals, open new markets...}
<A>__{she doesn't look up.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{when are you leaving?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{thing is. i'd like you to come.}
<A>__{she stiffens only slightly. can he sense it?}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{i don't really see how i can.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i've talked to the promoters, they'll switch some lecture dates for us.}
<A>__{now he's looking at her profile. saddened, if not surprised, by what he sees.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{well, it's not just that. there's my work on the shuttle, we're at a critical stage, and...i've just started as gene's consultant at the aeronautics branch...}
<A>__{she knows he's watching. shakes her head. keeps on working.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{normally, i'd be worried about leaving you here alone. but i suppose that won't be a problem, will it?}
<A>__{she stops now. looks up at him. if he wants a direct conversation, he can have it.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{what are you trying to say?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i think i've just said it.}
<A>__{a long held look. neither backing away. sadness on both sides.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{is there anything you want to say?}
<A>__{she sighs. her fingers reach out, rub his hand with affection.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{i can't think of anything helpful.}
<A>__{he nods. well, then. rises slowly... walks back toward the house, his garden tools forgotten. she stares after him. he disappears into the house. she's still staring.}
