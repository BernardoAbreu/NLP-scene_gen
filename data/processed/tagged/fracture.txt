<A>__{credits sequence: extreme close ups an unfinished mechanical device: a scaffold of thin metal pipes, levers, pulleys, wiring, serve motors. thomas crawford works on it: in his 40s, well dressed but in disarray, graying stubble, hair and clothes unkempt. magnifying glasses distort his eyes, making them huge and strange. he sets aside a tool, takes a marble sized ball bearing and drops it into a slot at the top of the device. his enlarged eyes follow the metal ball as it rolls and flips and spirals through a rube goldberg style maze, setting off bells, clicking past turnstiles then missing a leap and clattering across the work table. eyes on the device, crawford's hand traps the ball. he stays still, analyzing. he selects a tiny screwdriver from a neat array of metal working and electronics tools. makes a miniscule adjustment to a single jointerior drops in another ball. it rolls and flips and spirals all the way down. crawford doesn't react. just studies the machine. behind him, on a desk: a framed photograph of a beautiful woman in her mid 30s. his wife.}

<A>__{jennifer crawford is just reaching orgasm with rob nunally: mid 30s, good looking, aging boyish. they clutch each other, shuddering, lost in passion. and then, breathing heavily, caressing each other nunally rolls off her slowly coming back to earth. jennifer studies her lover, a quiet play of relief and gratitude and satisfaction on her face darkened by a troubled distance, maybe even fear. she is, after all, having an affair.}

<A>__{crawford stares through the grotesque lenses, motionless, expressionless. he takes a deep breath and checks his watch. then he stands, removing the glasses. we now see his office: large, austere. decor and equipment related to aircraft engineering. outside big windows, jets take off from an industrial airstrip. crawford gets a brand new bottle of jack daniels from a desk drawer, uncaps it and swigs as he opens the door to a private bathroom. he gargles, spits into the sink. he pours out more, then puts the half empty bottle back on his desk. he collects a home made device from the workbench: it looks like a pda connected by wires to a blank credit card. he puts it in the pocket of his suit jacket, which he sets on the desk. adjusts the placement of the open bottle, nearby. crawford goes to a light box, studying a set of large x rays: dark strips of welding in a grayish fuzz of metal. tina, his assistant, appears in the doorway.}

<A>__{the twisted, torn and burned wreckage of a large private jet is being reassembled on the big empty concrete floor. n.t.s.b. investigators in shirtsleeves and aircraft company executives in suits cluster around work boards covered with photographs and diagrams of a crash site. they look up, falling silent, as crawford comes in carrying the x ray. a few exchange surprised, concerned glances; this is not a man who skips a shave. but when he gets to them, crawford is laser like holding the x ray and pointing to a spot three inches above it:}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{it's here.}
<A>__{he hands a startled investigator the film and strides off toward the giant open doors out to the airfield. his foot knocks a piece of the carefully laid out wreckage in passing; it clatters across the concrete, but crawford doesn't slow or look back.}

<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i offered my losing cases in exchange for two or three of anyone else's possible convictions. they couldn't handle their workloads, and i prefer not to lose.}
<A>__{lobruto knew this; the question was would willy admit it.}
<C>__{lobruto}
<D>__{you're going to need a middle initial.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{sir?}
<C>__{lobruto}
<D>__{you're going to wooton sims.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{in two weeks.}
<C>__{lobruto}
<D>__{you'll be able to afford a better suit. but those guys all play squash and have middle names. they go in for the mother's maiden name a lot.}
<A>__{beat. willy doesn't like the implied personal judgement, but the only way it shows is how calm he stays.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{my mother didn't have a maiden name.}
<A>__{lobruto nods, unruffled by willy's hard calm.}
<C>__{lobruto}
<D>__{so you're a bastard; sometimes i can be a son of a bitch. maybe you belong here.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i didn't work this hard to stay where i belong.}
<C>__{lobruto}
<D>__{you're a street fighter, willy. you should be in court. we can move you up to better cases.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i appreciate the offer.}
<C>__{lobruto}
<D>__{i didn't think so.}

<D>__{no, i think that's everything thank you.}
<C>__{lobruto}
<D>__{the offer stands. if you get tired of carrying a spear.}

<C>__{willy}
<D>__{just get somebody else for this one.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{everybody's booked up. look: it's not going to trial. there's a weapon with prints, and a confession. take the arraignment and wait for the plea.}

<A>__{willy slips self consciously through the double doors, wearing the tuxedo. he gets even more self conscious when he notices a handful of local reporters. he hurries in passing nunally, in the back row. nunally is making a good show of keeping it together...but it's only a show. judge irene feldman, 50 ish, looks over her half glasses.}
<C>__{judge feldman}
<D>__{mr. slocum. nice to see a man who dresses for court.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{sorry, your honor. long story.}

<D>__{the state of california versus thomas crawford.}
<A>__{the defense rises; crawford hardly pays any attention to the judge glancing back and noticing nunally, whose eyes bore into him, haunted and burning. crawford stares at him impassively a second, then turns to lean past his p.d. and watch willy hastily skim the file.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{mr. crawford, you've been charged with section 664 slash 187 of the california penal code: attempted murder, with additional allegations of assault with a deadly weapon penal code section 245 dash a2, with great bodily injury, p.c. section 12022.07.}

<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{not guilty. but i also want to waive my right to counsel, and represent myself.}
<A>__{willy looks up from the file startled.}
<C>__{judge feldman}
<D>__{do you have a problem with your appointed counsel, mr. crawford?}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{no. i just want to do it myself. i believe it's within my rights.}

<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{i'm not your client. try and keep up, would you?}

<C>__{judge feldman}
<D>__{do the people have an objection or a comment for the record, mr. slocum?}
<A>__{willy hesitates, held by crawford's strange, amused gaze. shakes it off:}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i'm sorry, your honor: we've got the weapon and a signed confession. i really think mr. crawford needs a competent attorney to frankly negotiate a plea.}
<A>__{crawford reaches up with cuffed hands and adjusts an imaginary bow tie. willy self consciously touches where crawford indicated on his own collar, straightens his clip on. crawford nods: you're welcome. willy turns to the judge.}

<C>__{judge}
<D>__{you don't need to look out for mr. slocum, mr. crawford. the district attorney's office can shift another prosecutor to the case }

<D>__{all due respect, your honor, i'm worried this may turn into some sort of a circus }
<C>__{judge feldman}
<D>__{i appreciate your concern for the dignity of my courtroom, mr. slocum considering you're making the argument dressed as a game show host. unfortunately, the man is a tax paying citizen, entitled by our constitution to try and manipulate the legal system, like everybody else.}
<P>__{(turning)}
<C>__{judge feldman }
<D>__{as for you, mr. crawford, i strongly urge you to retain counsel. lack of same will not be grounds for appeal.}

<C>__{judge feldman}
<D>__{are the people ready to go to trial without a preliminary hearing?}

<C>__{willy}
<D>__{is that what i'm supposed to be?}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{i asked around. you're supposed to be top notch but to me it looks like you've got one foot out the door, and you're wiping the rest of us off the bottom of the other one.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i'm sorry to...disappoint you.}
<A>__{nunally is silent frustrated. the concrete walls and ceilings echo from distant cars.}

<C>__{willy}
<D>__{and now you want mine?}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{i'm here to warn you. take this seriously, because it's serious. this guy is stone cold and his wife is lying in a hospital bed with brain damage...}

<D>__{forget it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's a lock. we're good. put him down. bury him.}
<A>__{willy nods. nunally turns and walks away, down a ramp. willy watches him go. sad. like he's watching nunally drown. but he's seen people drown before...and he's not about to put out a hand. might get pulled in himself.}
<L>__{interior chandler pavilion lobby later}
<A>__{willy moves uneasily among clusters of laughing, chatting, sparkling formal dressed people. nikki gardner joins him, strolling alongside. she's his age, but her elegant dress, unlike his tux, was made for her.}

<D>__{are you a shark?}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{sorry?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{you've been circling the lobby for half an hour now, like if you stopped you'd die.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{if i stopped, i'd be standing around with no one to talk to. at which point, death would be a relief.}
<C>__{nikki}

<D>__{on bob's orders.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{listen, i don't...actually know "bob." i mean, i've only met the man once.}
<A>__{nikki nods, considering this. and him.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{interesting.}
<A>__{they're each conscious of an unexpected buzz of attraction. the lobby lights flicker, breaking the spell a little. as the crowd begins to drift toward the auditorium doors:}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{you like opera?}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{truth is, i haven't really had that much expos }
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{neither do i.}
<A>__{with a conspiratorial head tip, nikki moves toward the plaza doors. willy follows.}
<L>__{exterior arts center soon after}
<A>__{they stroll the emptying plaza, dressed to the nines.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{bob assigned you to my team. i will supervise your case work, steer you through the office arcana, and generally keep an eye on you.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{kind of like a mentor.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{kind of like a probation officer.}

<C>__{willy}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{wooton sims expects absolute loyalty and a hundred and ten percent performance. but: you get to work on legendary litigation. national, sometimes global, in scope. it's high stakes. and cut throat even within the team. we burn out associates at an astonishing rate.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{you're trying to scare me.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{willy}

<C>__{willy}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{who are you?}
<A>__{willy doesn't answer. maybe uncertain what she means. maybe not wanting her to know. or even not knowing, himself.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{we have a guy in our criminal division, fresh out of yale, named calvin tyler. one of our very rich clients gets pulled over, d.u.i. which is routine bullshit, so calvin gets it. against you. next thing we know, calvin is fired, and bob wooton, who has never even interviewed a junior associate before let alone hired one says you're on my team.}
<A>__{willy weighs his options. decides to level:}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{it was a good bust, so calvin came to me for a deal. i told him if he could arrange an interview for me with mr. wooton, i would throw the case. i laid out his arguments and evidence for him and i showed him how i would lose. calvin set up my appointment for the day after our court date. then he did what i had suggested in court and i wiped the floor with him. your client got the maximum. next day, i met with mr. wooton.}

<C>__{marchand}
<D>__{it's a perfectly good weapon. a heckler & koch nine millimeter. it's just no good as evidence. it's never been fired.}

<C>__{marchand}
<D>__{yep. bought by mr. thomas crawford and registered to his wife, about a month ago. apparently a gift.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{and between the shooting and arrest, this guy was locked inside his house.}
<C>__{marchand}
<D>__{is that a question?}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{no, i mean, just: what's the point? playing games with the gun. he's alone in the house with the victim, and he confessed it's not like the gun's gonna get him off the hook.}
<C>__{marchand}
<D>__{do you have a question i can answer?}
<A>__{beat. willy shakes the puzzle off, irritated:}

<C>__{willy}
<D>__{the idea here is we're trying to take boxes out not bring more in.}

<D>__{is that the idea?}
<A>__{willy sourly gestures to a chair; checks the label as the messenger sets it down }
<C>__{willy}

<C>__{messenger}
<D>__{i picked up at county. slip says bring 'em here.}
<A>__{messenger holds out a clipboard. willy reluctantly signs. as the messenger leaves, willy cuts the tape and takes out a folder. opens it: crawford has scrawled no in red marker across the top sheet. willy turns to the next page. a big red no across that, too. pulls out more documents flips through: no no no no red letters wriggling across the typed pages, like flip book animation. beat. disturbed, he picks up the phone, dials.}

<D>__{i don't need the gun to convict you, by the way.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{she was cheating, you know.}
<A>__{willy looks at him, slightly taken aback. he didn't know; it wasn't in the confession. as he considers whether it makes a difference he notices crawford watching, enjoying. willy shuts his briefcase.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{it doesn't matter what she did...tom. what you did is a crime.}
<C>__{crawford}

<C>__{willy}
<D>__{it's kind of clever: this guy is trying to provoke the system into declaring him insane. i think he thinks we'll call in the doctors and he can fake 'em out by refusing the defense. he's acting out this really organized plan to appear crazy.}

<A>__{crawford sits alone at the defense table. he wears an expensive suit and no handcuffs, but two deputies sit behind him. he's barely listening to the testimony drawing on his legal pad: intricate, dense complex diagrams of "rube goldberg" contraptions.}

"walking the scene" again, on paper. the whole apartment is an array of law books, notes, exhibits, marked up depositions. he's staring at evidence he's already stared at a hundred times. he grinds the palms of his hands into his eye sockets, a dull moan rising into a yell as he sweeps everything off his bed in a storm of paper throwing books tearing up printouts pulling out drawers, emptying them, smashing them on the desk yelling in a frenzy until his throat is hoarse, his shabby garage apartment is trashed, and he's sitting, exhausted, in his chair. there's a knock on the door. willy frowns, checking the clock: it's two thirty a.m. he goes to open it revealing nunally, standing in the darkness, a haunted shadow of the boyish confident cop we met making love to jennifer crawford.}

<D>__{brilliant.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{you know, this is really kind of fun. it's like showing some caveman a cigarette lighter.}
<A>__{willy looks down at the gun in his hand. thoughtful.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{this caveman's gonna put you in prison for the rest of your life.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{it's still not evidence, willy. there's no prints left by now. nothing ties that gun to me.}
<A>__{willy smiles, slow... enjoying himself, at last.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{no. that would be true. except for all those eggs.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{those what?}
<A>__{willy nods to himself, going to the wooden bowl of ball bearings selecting one, carrying it to the rube goldberg machine:}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{with all those little cracks and weak places. like nunally. shooting himself, right there in the courthouse. i didn't think he was going to do that. did you?}
<C>__{crawford}
<P>__{(wary)}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{studying the complex device, toying with crawford:}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i mean, we all knew he was going to fall apart sooner or later. that was part of your plan, right? like a bank shot, on a pool table: you kill your wife and destroy her lover. with one bullet.}
<P>__{(turns)}
<D>__{well: four bullets, actually. right?}
<A>__{crawford frowns. trying to see what willy's getting at.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{first bullet goes into your wife.}
<T>__{intercut quick flashbacks:}
<A>__{crawford fires at jennifer }
<C>__{willy }
<D>__{then three more out the front of the house, to get some attention.}
<A>__{ and fires three times at the transom.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{then while you're waiting for the show to begin you have to reload nunally's gun.}
<A>__{crawford pushes new bullets into the clip }
<C>__{willy }
<D>__{i mean, you don't want him wondering where the hell four bullets went, considering he never fired his gun that night.}
<A>__{ and slides the clip back into the gun, pleased. willy nods, thinking it out. sure of himself. he sets the ball bearing into the slot at the top of the machine }
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{and i'm betting you didn't worry about fingerprints.}
<A>__{crawford reacts. close: crawford's fingers, putting the bullets in the clip. willy lets the ball go watching it begin rolling down the ornate tracks.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i mean, why would you? nobody's going to be looking at his gun.}
<A>__{the ball tumbles and clatters flipping and clicking through the ingenious, precise, heartless machinery }
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{and sooner or later, life goes on, those four incriminating bullets would get used, and be gone forever.}
<A>__{ and crawford is recognizing, slowly, his one mistake. the gun in nunally's limp dead fingers, glimpsed on the marble courthouse floor, through the crowd.}
<C>__{willy }
<D>__{except nunally only fired one of those bullets. into himself.}
<A>__{willy turns from the machine which continues clattering and working, beside him.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{which means there are still three left with your fingerprints on them tom. in this clip.}
<A>__{he holds the gun up. savoring crawford's growing fear. they can hear a car rolling up the driveway. red and blue lights sweep the frosted glass by the front door.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{everybody has a weak spot, right? some place they break.}
<A>__{without looking, willy gently pushes the machine, moving it a fraction of an inch on the floor as the ball catapults out sailing across the living room in a perfect, graceful arc that misses the bowl. outside, the police car doors open and then slam. crawford, going pale, watches the metal ball roll off the coffee table and across the floor toward him. crawford doesn't move. trying to focus. his mind working. the ball comes to rest against crawford's shoe. the doorbell rings. crawford looks up. meeting willy's eyes. smiling slightly, willy tucks nunally's gun into his belt and puts his hands in the air. and gives crawford a wink. crawford is staring at willy, frozen panic and hatred and fear curdling in his eyes as behind him, the police begin pounding on the front door.}
