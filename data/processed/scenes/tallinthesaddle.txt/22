<L>__{interior stan's place day}
<A>__{full shot from doorway. it is a large barn like room on one side of which is a bar. on the other side is a fireplace and a partition behind which is a rough dining table and benches. standing at the bar drinking with his back to the door is a wizened little man, dressed in an odd assortment of ragged garments of unrecognizable origin. on the counter is a travelling prospector's pack, to which is strapped an assortment of prospector's equipment, including a pick and shovel. as dave enters, the man (zeke) turns around and reveals a face even hairier than dave's.}

<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{rocklin has entered and moved to the fire. miss martin and clara enter and stand in the doorway watching the scene at the bar. a pale faced, dyspeptic looking man of about 45 (stan) comes from the kitchen and approaches them ingratiatingly.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{good evening, ladies. how about something to eat?}
<C>__{miss martin}
<P>__{(with a dubious look}
<D>__{toward the pair at}

<D>__{why?}

<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{from fireplace. rocklin is standing in f.g. looking down at the fire and making the inevitable cigarette from his pocket dip. seated at the table are clara and miss martin. from o.s. comes the sound of zeke and dave singing to the phonograph record. miss martin glares indignantly in the direction of the bar, obviously about to make a protest. at this moment stan comes from the kitchen with a large dish in his hand which he dumps on the table.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{there you are, folks. dig in and help y'rselves.}
<A>__{miss martin, sitting forward eagerly, suddenly sees the dish of meat and freezes.}

<A>__{camera has panned to include the side door next to the window and almost opposite to the dining table. the owner of the face at the window (bob clews) is now standing in the doorway. behind him is the man with the sheriff's badge on his dirty vest (jackson). as they come forward toward stan, the latter shows obvious signs of nervousness.}

<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{like i said i wouldn't want to make a mistake with an ole timer.}
<A>__{jackson follows stan into the kitchen. clews moves to the fire and lunges there picking his teeth and eyeing clara, who stirs uneasily under the man's gaze.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{as rocklin comes out of the thoughtful mood in which he has been plunged by the information about red caldwell and notes the by play between clews and clara. he frowns and makes a movement as if about to rise. at the same time, dave and zeke, whose voices have been heard throughout in the b.g., stagger into the shot.}
<C>__{dave}
<P>__{(chuckling and pointing to miss martin)}

<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(indicating food)}
<D>__{seems we're eatin' stolen beef.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{somebody's loco. stan might have given house room to bit o' dead beef, but he'd never be fool enough to leave the hide lyin' around.}
