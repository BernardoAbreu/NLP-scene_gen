<A>__{didgeridoo music. a child admires a painting. swanbeck and ethan face one another. a long, long pause. for a moment it appears as if swanbeck has lost awareness of ethan's presence.}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{sorry, ethan. i don't quite know where to begin. any suggestions?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{you'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{why not? you've done just about everything else on this operation.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{i'd thank you but i'm not sure that was a compliment.}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{of course it was. anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there. you try flogging the stories on cnn i've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days. at any rate, it's been most instructive what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.}
<P>__{(picking up a file)}
<D>__{miss hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the chimera virus. not even antibodies.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{yes, i gathered as much.}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{and the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from ambrose.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{and that appears to have been destroyed. it also contained the anti virus, bellerophon.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{well, bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against chimera.}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{but you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the chimera virus. i'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{by fire. that's the best way, really.}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{so you didn't fail mission, you simply changed it.}
<A>__{ethan doesn't respond.}
<C>__{swanbeck }
<D>__{it's no longer enough for you to execute and implement imf policy, you now wish to go in the business of creating it?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{no, i don't. but in this case }
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{in this case, it wasn't a bad idea. in face, it was a pretty damn good idea. just don't make a habit of it. and, as for ms. hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged. i'm assuming you approve.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{where is she now, by the way? do you know?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{i don't. no exactly.}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{well, hunt, what are your plans?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{not sure. some sort of vacation. i will let you know where i'm going.}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{oh, you don't have to do that. wouldn't be a vacation if you did.}
<A>__{ethan and swanbeck exchange one final, knowing glance.}

<D>__{this incident in the wake of rumors suddenly surfacing about mr. mccloy and biocyte's financial difficulties including criminal allegations of insider trading, embezzlement, conspiracy to commit fraud, and stock parking have, understandably, sent stock prices of the pharmaceutical company plummeting.}
