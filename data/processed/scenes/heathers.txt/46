<A>__{hungover in dark sunglasses, veronica stumbles down the hall. she stops to read a sign plastered on a wall: the new happiness a special lunchtime announcement ala pauline fleming. veronica takes off her sunglasses, squints, then continues down the hall.}
<B>__{the cafeteria}
<A>__{pauline's evita peron like composure is crumbling.}

<D>__{yo, what's the problem? i know you know how to hold hands. ring around the rosy a pocketful of posy...forget it! i'm just so thrilled to announce that whitney james of wetc news is taping a rap session with students from area high schools including westerburg .}
<A>__{cheers raucously emerge from the enlivened students.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{let's show the world westerburg is a diverse happy home, not suicide central!}
<P>__{(shrewdly)}
<D>__{you know there's some people who say westerburg is too weak and wimpy a school to be on t.v. is that true?}
<A>__{the students make loud, scattered rumblings of the word "no." pauline hungrily unbuttons her paisley blazer.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{no or hell no?}
<C>__{students}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{hell no!}
<A>__{frightened and flustered by the fanatic camaraderie around her, martha dunnstock dumptruck quakes for a moment then crawls underneath her table.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{i can't hear you....}
<A>__{fingering her bangs in an attempt at composure, veronica steps into the cafeteria and her fellow students boom.}
<C>__{students}
<D>__{hell no!}
<A>__{as a blown away veronica takes in the panorama of students from different cliques chanting to the beat of pauline's gospel recital, pauline's voice is replaced on the soundtrack by the evocative female moanings of the opening scene. j.d., also wearing a black armband, stalks veronica from behind. his hand unzips her dress. the female voices swell louder as a glowing veronica takes in glorious images. geek braces and a jock chant together, standing on chairs. heather mcnamara and heavy metaler matt look to each other dubiously then mindlessly shout out. a morrisonesque stoner dances on a table of cheering betty finn a likes. j.d. slides his hand through the opening in veronica's dress. the female voices cut off as the spell over veronica breaks. she swings her elbow into j.d.'s stomach.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{can't you see this is a special moment?}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{i was just making it more special.}
<C>__{pauline }
<D>__{veronica, there you are!}
<A>__{veronica spins to an electric pauline fleming glistening in the mouth of the cafeteria, flanked by heather duke and peter dawson.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{you people are in charge of getting delegates from every clique in the school to be on the whitney james teenage suicide prevention t.v. special. let's be able to say we were the ones who put peer pressure out to pasture.}
<A>__{j.d. looks out through the cafeteria. he sees martha poke her head out from beneath her lunch table then dart back under. j.d. moves away from the chattering group.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{westerburg? a happy family?}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{i'm sure you'll work something out.}
<C>__{heather duke}
<P>__{(wickedly)}
<D>__{don't worry. we'll work something out.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{yes. yes. we'll work something out. i swear to god. won't we j.d.?...j.d.?}
<A>__{martha dunnstock dumptruck's table martha slithers from under the table up into her seat, and head down, trys to finish off a bowl of soup. she slowly looks up and freezes. j.d. is revealed to be seated across from her, behind his rebel without a cause lunch box. he smiles warmly.}
