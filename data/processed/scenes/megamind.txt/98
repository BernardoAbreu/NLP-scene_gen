<L>__{interior wayne scott's mansion night}
<A>__{the doors opens. a beam of moonlight immediately pierces the darkness, forming an illuminated path into the heart of the manor. master mind enters. covered in dust and cobwebs, the hall looks like a gigantic crypt.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{good lord, man. you've only been dead for two months.}
<A>__{master mind walks, coming to a gigantic painted portrait of wayne scott. he stops to reverently admire the image of his fallen foe.}
<C>__{master mind }
<D>__{a disguise so simple, it's ingenious. no wonder i never caught on.}
<A>__{besides the armani suit, there's nothing to hide the fact that this is the same person as uberman. in the picture, he's even standing in the same cheesy, heroic pose with his fists on his hips.}
<C>__{master mind }
<D>__{two lives, yet in both you were an ideal. perhaps it was you who was victorious in the end, old friend.}
<A>__{a bonging sound suddenly bellows through the dark halls. master mind comes to a grandfather clock standing next to a gigantic bookcase. on the twelfth bong it falls silent. master mind begins to slide it across the floor until he hears a loud click. the bookcase slides into the wall, revealing a hidden}
<B>__{passage.}
<C>__{master mind }
<D>__{i will miss how predictable you were.}
<A>__{the passage way leads master mind to a working escalator. master mind gets off the escalator to see a long hallway with stone walls. he begins to hear strange sounds, almost like muffled screams, coming from a doorway at the end of the hallway. master mind starts walking towards it. as he steps closer, he begins to notice a light cracking through the bottom of the door.}
<C>__{master mind }
<D>__{hello? anyone here...besides..all the big men who are with me now?}
<A>__{nothing.}
<C>__{master mind }
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{what's the worst you're gonna find?}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{the man was a boy scout, not a serial killer.}
<A>__{he opens the door to his immediate amazement. it's some kind of screening room. a projector shoots an image onto a dirty white screen hanging on the wall. beer cans litter the floor; a table in front of a ripped up couch is covered in discarded snack goods; and a kiss pinball machine stands in the far corner next to a closed door. master mind turns his attention to the action on the screen.}
<B>__{screen}
<A>__{a woman dressed in a leather dominatrix outfit is whipping an overweight man lying on a swing like device with his butt sticking out.}
<C>__{dominatrix in film}
<D>__{you are a worm!}
<A>__{she whips him three times. the man cries out in pain.}
<C>__{fat man in film}
<D>__{pineapple!!! pineapple!!!}
<A>__{master mind's eyes are transfixed on the disturbing imagery. the door by the pinball machine suddenly swings open. wayne scott, dressed in raggedy sweats, steps into the room carrying a can of beer and a bowl of jiffy pop. master mind cannot believe his horrified eyes.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{ahhhhhh!}
<A>__{wayne scott is just as startled.}
<C>__{wayne scott}
<D>__{jesus!}
<A>__{he drop his drink and snack to the floor. the two men stare at each other as they struggle to regain their normal breathing patterns. wayne scott walks over to the couch, brushes off a thick layer of chip crumbs, and sits down.}
<C>__{wayne scott }
<D>__{what the hell are you doing here?}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{i might just ask you the same question. i had thought i incinerated you.}
<C>__{wayne scott}
<D>__{you scared the bejesus out of me. how'd you figure out i was still alive? wait, how do you know my identity!?}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{roxanne told me. as for your ruse, i forgot to line the bottom of the copper cage somebody pointed that out to me recently. figured if they could do it, so could you. but one thing i couldn't figure out }
<C>__{wayne scott}
<D>__{the skeleton? something i "borrowed" from a medical school a few months before.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{a few months? how long had you been planning this?}
<C>__{wayne scott}
<D>__{i always planned to retire eventually. i mean, come on, you can't do this sort of thing in your fifties. you'd just look ridiculous.}
<A>__{the pieces of the puzzle appear to be coming together in master mind's head.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{i see it all so clearly now.}
