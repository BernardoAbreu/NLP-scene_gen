<A>__{the pickers on their ladders, all picking. homer is now a good picker; he looks over at rose rose. she is slumped against the ladder, not picking, completely ignoring an argument beneath them in the aisle between the trees. (mr. rose is checking over the apples peaches has just picked.)}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<D>__{you pickin' nothin' but cider apples, peaches i hope you understand that.}
<C>__{peaches}
<D>__{they ain't drops i picked 'em off the tree!}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<D>__{then you pickin' 'em too fast they ain't no better than drops to me. see that bruise, and that one? half of these is bruised! look at this one! it ain't got no stem! you might as well step on 'em, too they only good for cider.}
