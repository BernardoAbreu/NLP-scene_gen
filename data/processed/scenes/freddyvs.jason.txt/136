<L>__{exterior lonely road night}
<A>__{an ambulance races along the road with it's emergency lights flashing. in back erwin lays strapped to a gurney. up front sit a driver and an attendant. they chat disparagingly about the freak in the back, when suddenly a large form appears in the road just ahead. the driver slams on the brakes and the wheels lock up with a terrible squeal. whump! the ambulance plows into the form, knocking it some fifty feet down the road. the driver and the attendant stare out of the cracked windshield in shock. finally, the driver turns to the attendant and says:}
<C>__{ambulance driver}
<D>__{i will go check it out. you stay here.}
<A>__{the driver gets out and goes to the form laying in the road. he bends down to examine the charred, mammoth carcass when a fist flies up, smacking the driver in the face. he falls to the ground, unconscious. the corpse sits up in the glare from the headlights it's jason! burnt and blackened but ready for action! he starts towards the ambulance. the attendant gets out and pulls his service revolver, emptying into jason's chest. jason recoils only slightly as bullet hits burst his coveralls, then he grabs the attendant by the head as he snaps the empty pistol in panic. jason slams the attendant's face into the side of the ambulance. in the back of the ambulance, a terror stricken erwin watches as a face shaped dent appears in the wall with a sickening wrenching of metal and flesh. then... silence. rip! jason pulls off the back door of the ambulance and climbs inside, the shocks bottoming out under his weight. he reaches out for erwin, who closes his eyes... waiting for the inevitable. then... nothing. after a second, erwin opens an eye. jason is standing over him, hand outstretched. in his big, burnt palm meagan's necklace. erwin looks from the necklace to jason. jason thrusts out his hand impatiently.}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{you... want me to tell you where meagan is?}
<A>__{again with the thrusting.}
<C>__{erwin}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{well why didn't you say so?! jesus, for a minute there i thought you were going to kill me.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{you're not, are you?}
<A>__{jason shakes his palm at erwin yet a third time.}
<C>__{erwin}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{okay... okay! i will take you right to her. could you help me out of this?}
<A>__{jason reaches over and yanks out the gurney straps. erwin exits out the back with jason following close behind. erwin climbs in behind the wheel, saying:}
<C>__{erwin}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i will drive.}
<A>__{jason pushes erwin aside so roughly that he slams into the passenger side door.}
<C>__{erwin}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{okay... you drive.}
<A>__{as jason climbs into the driver's seat, a chime goes off as a female computer voice in a pleasant tone says:}
<C>__{computer voice}
<D>__{fasten your safety belt, please.}
<A>__{erwin fastens his. jason watches him and pulls the safety belt across his massive chest it won't reach. jason pulls harder, ripping the belt out of the bolts. the chime goes crazy.}
<C>__{computer voice}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{fasten your safety belt, please... fasten your safety belt, please...}
<A>__{jason smashes the dashboard with his fist, silencing the voice and chime. he turns suddenly to erwin as if to say, "yeah?! what about it?" erwin shrugs nervously:}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{fuck the bitch. let's roll!}
<A>__{with tires squealing, burning rubber and smoke, the ambulance roars away into the early morning.}
