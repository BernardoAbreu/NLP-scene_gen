<L>__{ext early morning. thunder bay}
<A>__{robbie and pipeman are in the middle of a practice session. pipeman is at the side, robbie is in the water on his board.}
<C>__{pipeman}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{ok, now this time, get up on the board more quickly. this is a wave pool and this wave dissipates quickly. you only have a little time to show your stuff.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{how will the judging work?}
<C>__{pipeman}
<D>__{you get a possible ten points. three for your surfing, three for your style and four for the judge's overall impression of your ride. no one's ever gotten a ten...i'm not really sure why.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{you've seen the competition. what does everybody do?}
<C>__{pipeman}
<D>__{everybody just surfs, man and tries not to fall. the big reason cowboy's done so well is he goes to hawaii for a couple weeks every year. but there he's mostly a longboarder. your job is to figure out how to make the most outta this little wave.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{ok. i'm ready.}
<A>__{the wave comes and robbie catches it and surfs it hard, kicking up high at the end.}
