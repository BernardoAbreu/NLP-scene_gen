<L>__{exterior "rockdonald's" restaurant night}
<A>__{"rockdonald's" is, of course, complete with golden arches of stone, a drive up window, etc. it even has the oblig atory cops on a break... in this case, feldspar and gravel. they're sitting in their patrol car eating from little bamboo containers shaped just like mcdonald's styrofoam. (of course, the logo on the building behind them proudly reads "over 100 sold.")}
<C>__{feldspar}
<P>__{(mouth full, bitching)}
<D>__{speed traps again! face it, gravel. i'm in a rut... and meanwhile, the guys who went through the academy with me, they're all big shots now: sam slate... dirty harock... magma, p.i. and you know why? 'cause they got the breaks, that's why!}
<A>__{suddenly both officers react to the sound of skidding tires and honking horns. they look out their window at fred and barney driving past both still battling the wheel and the resistant costume head. (by now their gyrations have put barney's face inside the jaws of the monster mask.)}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{gravel}
<D>__{s sarge, d did you see that? some sorta creature was attacking that little guy !}
<C>__{feldspar}
<D>__{there's a lesson there, gravel... never pick up hitchhikers. besides }
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{ did you say 'creature'?}
<A>__{they do a big double take at the now vanishing car.}
<D>__{feldspar & gravel the xenosaurus!}
<A>__{excited, feldspar bangs his dashboard and a dispatch parakeet in a police uniform pops into view. feldspar grabs it around the neck, holds it like a microphone.}
<C>__{feldspar}
<D>__{this is a xenosaurus alert. repeat, a xenosaurus alert. the creature has been sighted on the slate city exit of the venturock freeway! it is driving a brown late model sedan and eating a white male caucasian. car twelve is in hot pursuit.}
<A>__{he releases the bird, which doesn't fly away right away, but gives him a look.}
<C>__{feldspar}
<P>__{(remembering)}
<D>__{oh, yeay... over and out!}
<A>__{the bird nods, appeased, flies off.}
<C>__{dispatch parakeet}
<P>__{(as it goes)}
<D>__{awwk! car twelve is on the way. car twelve is on the way...}
<C>__{feldspar}
<P>__{(thrilled)}
<D>__{gravel, this could mean promotions for both of us!}
<P>__{(trotting up to speed)}
<D>__{load the shotgun and turn on the siren!}
<A>__{fred's car travelling barney is rocking fred's head back and forth, finally gives it one last mighty yank. something breaks. barney falls back on the passenger side of the car. fred drives with one hand, "raps" the monster head. it rattles. when fred speaks again, the monster mouth no longer opens and closes in sync.}
<C>__{fred}
<P>__{(muffled, shouting)}
<D>__{ho, gweat! hoo bwoke hit, bahnee! hi khnat twalk hennymore!}
<A>__{suddenly both men (pardon, man and xenosaurus) react to an approaching siren. they both look back at felspar's patrol car closing in. gravel has produced a little sabre tooth cat and is "cranking" its tail. as it wails away, the cops close in on our heroes.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{ho noh! ahhrisser felghspah!}
<P>__{(turning to barney)}
<D>__{haybee whee hould shtop ?}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{what, and explain what you're doing in that costume? start talking about coo coo berries and fibrerock? by then it'll be too late!}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{'hen yore height, yore height...}
<A>__{fred pours on more speed. they careen around a turn. camera whip pans to a road sign: slate city 1 mi. slate city rear gate a fence surrounds the empty housing development; in the distance, we can see the dark slate scrapers, and past them, the brightly lit and gleaming fibersphere and slate needle. we hear a screech and then the camera pans back to pickup fred's car as it whips around a turn, two wheels off the ground. it crashes right into the gate, knocking down a sign reading "slate city delivery gate." the fence collapses all around the car.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{fred and barney stagger out of the wreck. barney, covered with debris, rummages around and sighs with relief when he finds the flit gun of coo coo sap is still intact.}
<C>__{barney}
<P>__{(hearing a siren)}
<D>__{we'd better split up; that way at least one of us can make it to the slate needle !}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{'ood hidea. ood whuk, ol' bhudee.}
<A>__{they slap hands together like basketball players, then head off in two directions.}
