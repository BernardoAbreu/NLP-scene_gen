<A>__{a cold day on a nice country club course. anthony watches bob hit a hard slide straight into the rough. bob stands there in a frozen follow through. then he suddenly swings his club and hums it down the fareway. he starts to walk back to the golf cart.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{bob, where you going?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i'm not playing any more golf.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{cause i'm not getting any better. it's a waste of time.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{you've only been playing for two weeks, bob. it takes a long time to learn this game.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{you think i'm improving?}
<C>__{anthony}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{yes. you just got to stick with it.}
<A>__{bob looks down the fareway. he takes a deep breath and starts walking toward his club about twenty yards away.}
