<A>__{enters as johnny speaks. dizzy is laid out in dress gray. the surviving roughnecks have gathered to pay final respects.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{dizzy bought the farm. she was my good friend, and friens are the best luck anyone gets... but in war, we must go on without our friends. we take with us their memory, and we are left to wonder if there is meaning in their death. let me tell you what it is: dizzy bough the farm so we can keep on fighting.}
<A>__{several intelligence officers march into the bay.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{officer on deck !}
<A>__{everyone snaps to attention. colonel carl jenkins strides into the room. his eyes are hollow, and he looks grim. he returns johnny's salute, nods to carmen.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{please continue, sergeant.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{dizzy wouldn't want our tears. she'd want us to remember her... with a vengeance. so go out and kill a bug for dizzy. kill as many as you can. you are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death.}
<A>__{johnny nods to the gunnery crew. they load dizzy's body into a tube. johnny steps back, salutes dizzy. everyone salutes.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{womb to tomb, cap trooper !}
<C>__{roughnecks}
<D>__{womb to tomb !}
<A>__{the crew chief fires the tube. out the viewports, a pulse of light disperses into space. the roughnecks file out. carl approaches. carmen takes johnny and carl by the hand.}
<C>__{carmen}
<D>__{well, look at this. the three of us back together again.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{how are you, carl ?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{johnny, i'm sorry it had to be your unit on planet p. that mission had a very low survival probability...}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{elegant proof of intelligence, isn't it ? we thought there might be a brain on p.}
<C>__{carmen}
<D>__{you knew and you sent them anyway ?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{a colony has to reach a certain size before it produces a brain... we think 300 generations. woulda too expensive to launch an operation if there wasn't a brain...}
<A>__{carl sees the way carmen is looking at him, like he's a bug.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{you don't approve. well, too bad. we're in this for the species, boys and girls. it's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday i have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{didn't they tell you, colonel ? that's what cap troopres are good for.}
<A>__{carl allows himself a tiny smile.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{hope you're ready for more. we're going back to p to capture that brain.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{the roughnecks are always ready, sir.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i hear they need a new lieutenant... want the job ?}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{i will take it... until i get killed or you find someone better.}
<A>__{klaxons sound. suddenly, everyone has someplace to go.}
<C>__{carmen}
<D>__{hope you get your brain bug, carl.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{it's good to see you two. it reminds me of the way things were before...}
<A>__{carl turns abruptly and heads away. his entourage follows.}
<C>__{carmen}
<D>__{take care, wilya johnny ?}
