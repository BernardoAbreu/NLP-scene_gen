<L>__{exterior alley day}
<A>__{meetoo is trapped. the pack surrounds him, ready to pounce when anya leaps into the middle of the circle. the pack is startled, but begins to advance on both anya and meetoo. anya doesn't know what to do. she crouches and then. . . growls back at them, making her eyes look as ferocious as possible. the pack exchange a confused look; there's a girl growling at them. meetoo stands, suddenly brave, behind her and growls along with her. suddenly, anya pounced toward the pack, growling louder. the pack has definitely had enough some start to back out quizzically, others turn and run like hell. anya turns to meetoo, who looks up at her gratefully, wagging his tail. anya picks up the bone and puts it back in his mouth.}
