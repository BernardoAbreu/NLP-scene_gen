<A>__{annina beckons to him. beyond her, he sees albert, andy, and bruno. he's being escorted or maybe just pushed it's hard to tell. each step of the way, he's pounced upon by individuals we've never met. the room is wall to wall with people. people are swept along in currents.}

<A>__{they are approached by mary boone, a short woman in high heels and an armani suit).}
<C>__{andy warhol }
<D>__{jean michel, this is mary boone. she's got the great new gallery.}

<P>__{(shaking jean's hand)}
<D>__{you should be pleased. it's a great show...i'm having a dinner later at mr. chow's for albert. you should come.}
<A>__{in the background, we see annina watching.}
<C>__{andy warhol}
<D>__{you'll like it. everyone'll be there.}
<A>__{annina walks over to jean with a couple.}
<C>__{annina nosei}
<D>__{jean, your parents are here.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{hi dad. hi nora.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{congratulations.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{thanks for coming.}
<A>__{rene appears out of the crowd.}
<C>__{annina nosei}
<P>__{(continuing to jean's father)}
<D>__{you must be very proud.}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{i am!}
<C>__{rene}
<D>__{how does it feel to have a genius in the family?}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{it feels... good!}
<A>__{jean notices benny across the room. he slows down and waves. jean sees gina across the room wearing the scarf. just beyond her, he sees big pink approaching. there must be ten people between them.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<P>__{(to rene)}
<D>__{i will be right back.}
<A>__{he moves towards her. suddenly, directly in front of him are the krugers.}
<C>__{tom kruger}
<D>__{we love our painting.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{which painting?}
<C>__{tom kruger}
<D>__{the green one.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{oh yeah.}
<C>__{cynthia kruger}
<D>__{we got a couch to match.}
<C>__{tom kruger}
<D>__{she's only kidding!}
<A>__{looking past the krugers, jean looks for gina. he sees her. his path is blocked. he presses forward, looking for gina, getting caught in the crowd. jean strains to keep an eye on gina and big pink.. benny arrives at jean's side holding a bottle of jack daniels and a shot glass.}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{willie mays. a toast.}
<A>__{jean brushes past him.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{not now, ok?}
<A>__{benny is left standing next to andy holding the bottle. jean manages to advance a few more feet through the crowd, then runs smack into rockets, his drug dealer.}
<C>__{rockets}
<D>__{jean michel, my man. nice party. should we step into my office?}
<A>__{nearby, benny sees this meeting and walks off, disgusted, thinking this is why jean gave him the brush off.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{that's alright. i'm cool now.}
<A>__{jean looks off and sees big pink fingering the scarf, saying something to gina. gina slaps her in the face. jean tries to get around the dealer. gina turns to leave. she catches jean's eye. she walks out.}
<C>__{rockets}
<D>__{a gift! i was just trying to give you a gift!}
<A>__{the dealer palms something to jean.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{i gotta go.}
<A>__{jean steps away from rockets, but is trapped in the crowd. rockets looks after him with disappointment. rene arrives with, andy, bruno, and a photographer.}
<C>__{rene}
<P>__{(edging his way in)}
<D>__{this guy wants a picture.}
<A>__{they shrug and crowd in jean, andy, and rene. the photographer gets them to squeeze closer and closer.}
<C>__{photographer}
<D>__{of the painters, please.}
<A>__{there's not enough room. rene accidentally gets pushed out of frame. rene fumes. albert milo arrives with his parents (jack and esther milo). they are a nice jewish couple in their 70's.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{he said 'of the painters!' hey albert! get in the picture!}
<A>__{albert crowds in. the photographer snaps a picture and the flash blinds everyone momentarily.}
<C>__{albert milo}
<D>__{hey, jean, i'd like you to meet my wife....and my parents. mom, dad, this is jean michel basquiat.}
<A>__{jean pulls out a joint and lights it as if it were a cigarette. he offers it to albert, who takes a hit.}
<C>__{esther milo}
<P>__{(frowning at her son)}
<D>__{don't do that.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{hello, jean.}
<C>__{jack milo}
<D>__{hi, john... are your parents here?}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{well.}
<P>__{(inhaling)}
<D>__{my dad's here with his wife. my mom couldn't make it.}
<A>__{he offers the joint to albert's mother.}
<C>__{esther milo}
<P>__{(waving it away)}
<D>__{no thanks.}
<A>__{everyone laughs.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(to jean)}
<D>__{i'd like to do a show with you.}
<P>__{(pointing to "rene 5:11" painting)}
<D>__{i'm especially interested in that one. i'd like to buy it for myself.}
<A>__{jean spots the very word on the painting ("rene 5:11") and freezes for a second.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{i wasn't gonna sell this one.}
<A>__{he looks around the room for rene, but doesn't see him. bruno remains smiling, waiting for an answer.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{you shouldn't have put it in the show. this is the one i absolutely have to have. i really love it.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{sure, ok..}
<A>__{jean wants out. he feels compromised.}
<C>__{basquiat }
<D>__{do you think i could borrow your limousine? i will get it back to you in an hour.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{it's ok. just have him bring you to dinner at mr. chow's later. we'll be there.}
<C>__{andy warhol}
<D>__{bye, jean.}
<A>__{jean makes his way through the crowd, as we see images of the crowd and fragments of paintings. as he nears the door, he feels his arm pulled.}
<C>__{rene}
<P>__{(hissing)}
<D>__{you fucking little whore! you sold my painting! i'm gonna tell you something, brother when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs! believe that shit.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{i will make you another one.}
<C>__{rene}
<D>__{forget it.}
<A>__{he pulls out a scrap of paper and starts writing.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{rene }
<A>__{rene shushes him... he hisses loudly, like a cat.}
<C>__{rene}
<D>__{shhhhhh. later.}
<P>__{(speaking to himself)}
<D>__{"what is it about art, anyway......"}
<A>__{jean pauses. he turns around and surveys the room once more. a blink. silence. we see the crowd in slow motion. everyone's eyes are shut.}
<P>__{rene (o.s.; cont'd)}
<D>__{... that we give it so much importance? artists are respected by the poor because what they do is an honest way to get out of the slum using one's sheer self as the medium. the money earned is proof pure and simple of the value of that individual... the artist.}
