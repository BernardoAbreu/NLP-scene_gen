<A>__{a dense gathering of partygoers is packed tight within the confines of carter's room, rather small despite being the largest bedroom in the house. the collection of partygoers are watching with religious fervor the basketball game playing from the modest tv in the room. carter, berubi, aaron and troy are among the crowd. all those gathered here have an interest in the game, but none as much as buggerin' bobby bales, who stands back against the far wall though the nobody in the congregation dares venture into his sightline of the television. partygoers yell in unison at various events displayed on the screen. the door opens, and pedro peeks into the room.}
