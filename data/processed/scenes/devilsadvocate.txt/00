<L>__{interior florida courtroom day}
<A>__{northern florida in the midst of a heat wave. air conditioners fighting a losing battle. the gallery is full. the judge a stern, old hand. the prosecutor, an efficient man with a good case. the witness is barbara. she is maybe 13. she is a witness in a criminal trial. her testimony has been carefully rehearsed.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{... we go back to our homeroom for dismissal, unless you have a pass for sports or something.}
<C>__{prosecutor }
<D>__{and is that what you did on the day in question?}
<C>__{barbara}

<D>__{mr. gettys closed the door.}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{everyone else had gone?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{yes. he told me to sit in the chair beside his desk.}
<A>__{mr. gettys, the defendant, is 50. the very picture of respectability. his perfect wife and son staunchly enduring this testimony.}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{in your own words, barbara, can you tell us exactly what happened during the next few minutes?}
<A>__{kevin lomax. defense counsel. taking it all in.}
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{i told him i was afraid i would miss my bus. he promised i would get to the bus on time if i would help him to do something...}
<A>__{kevin his eyes drifting around the courtroom taking inventory assessing damage }
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{... then he put before i could say anything he placed his hand inside my blouse...}
<A>__{kevin checking the jury and }
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{... i was so frightened i didn't move. i thought if i was just quiet it would be okay...}
<A>__{kevin checking gettys seeing something that stops him cold }
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{... then his other hand went up under inside my skirt...}
<A>__{gettys' hand down below the table down where no one but kevin could possibly see it getty's fingers subtly feeling their way along the leg of his chair }
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{... his hand then, it started, he started, moving back and forth farther and farther inside my skirt...}
<A>__{kevin glancing around nobody else can see it }
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{... he said he was testing to see if i had any special feelings, that he wanted to find out what kind of feelings i had...}
<A>__{gettys' hand excited now stroking the chair leg absently involuntarily unmistakably sexual }
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{... i didn't know what to say, i was trying to think of something to say but i was confused and he just kept on with his hand moving it under my dress higher and higher...}
<A>__{kevin is rocked. trying not to show it.}
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{... then i, i was asking him to stop but it was like he couldn't hear me he just kept on }
<A>__{suddenly, gettys' hand stops moving }
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{ and then i screamed...}
<A>__{kevin looks up to find gettys' eyes waiting for him. gettys quickly returns his hand into his lap. he's been caught watching, as kevin turns away and }
