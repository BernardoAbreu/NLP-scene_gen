<C>__{clemenza}
<D>__{paulie, pull over. i gotta take a leak.}
<A>__{the car pulls off the causeway, into the reeds. clemenza steps out of the car, our view moving with him. he turns his back three quarters from us (we can no longer see the car), unzips, and we hear the sound of urine hitting the ground. we wait on this for a moment; and then there are two gunshots. clemenza finishes his leak, zips up and turns, moving back to the car. paulie is dead, bleeding from the mouth; the windows behind him are shattered.}

<A>__{lampone gets out, the two men walk through the reeds a few feet where there is another car. they get in, and drive off. fade out: }
