<L>__{interior chimera stairway passageway moments later day}
<A>__{murphy and epps come up the stairway, crossing to the doors.}
<L>__{exterior chimera forward deck continuous day}
<A>__{as epps and murphy come out, moving toward the make do raft.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{it should be enough to get us to one of those islands. gimme a hand, wouldya?}
<A>__{she joins him and they lift it off its stand, taking it to the rail.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{prop it here. we need to pull these braces off. there's a hammer on the stand. there.}
<A>__{epps crosses back to the stands.}
<B>__{at the stands}
<A>__{epps kneels. no hammer. she pulls back murphy's canvas duffle, folding back the flap to reveal a shotgun, the shotgun dodge had when he died. a beat as she holds there, when murphy's hand grabs it.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{i will take that.}
<A>__{a beat as she looks to murphy.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{it was you.}
<A>__{he only looks back at her as she stands there.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you killed them.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{it was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{you saw it coming as well as i did. dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. and greer too, except he went nuts. couldn't take it, i guess. could've happened in the middle of downtown anchorage. but did it make him any less dangerous? i don't think so.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{so you killed them?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{the way i figure it, it was them or me. i thought putting dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? bought a little time. made it look like whoever killed those greeks was still around. but it's just us on this ship. us and your... spirit friends.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{and now you're gonna kill me, is that it?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{i didn't want it to turn out this way.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{murphy, don't you see what's happening?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{i think i see it pretty well.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{it's the ship. the ship's making you think this way.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{i know a little bit about human nature and what i've seen only confirms that.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{it's a trap. there was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. nobody ever does. it's just the bait. this ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{i think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. there's nothing supernatural about greed. and that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i don't give a damn about the gold.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{i wish i could believe that. either way, you know what i've done. i've got no choice.}
<A>__{he raises the shotgun.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{he prepares to fire, when a concussion rocks the ship. epps ducks and murphy fires, a spatter of buckshot shredding the vent behind her. a screeching of metal deep in the ship sounds as she gets up, diving for cover as murphy shuttles the gun again.}
<B>__{with epps}
<A>__{epps scrambles behind a deck vent.}
