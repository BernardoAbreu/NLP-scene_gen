<L>__{exterior student union late afternoon}
<A>__{the place is a circus. the front steps of the student center have been roped off to form a platform. a podium and mike have been placed center. crowds have gathered for the press conference that is being held by the university. reporters and cameras have been roped off to the side. on stage, dean fisher, a sharp looking woman in her forties is talking to spectators.}
<C>__{dean fisher}
<P>__{(reading from a prepared statement)}
<D>__{"... and we feel this unfortunate isolated tragedy in no way reflects upon our fine school and we should trust that the authorities and fbi are acting quickly to bring us answers..."}
<A>__{beside her stand uniformed cops, the local sheriff, fbi agents. she continues on...}
<B>__{in the roped off news section}
<A>__{gale walks through the crowd, listening to the dean.}
<C>__{female voice }
<D>__{gale? can i have a second?}
<A>__{gale spins around to find debbie salt, the flashy reporter who she decked earlier, standing in front of her.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{look, i'm sorry about the face.}
<C>__{debbie salt}
<D>__{job hazard. debbie salt, stringer newsweek. answer a few questions?}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{fair enough.}
<C>__{debbie salt}
<D>__{what are you doing here? i thought you had retired from field reporting?}
<A>__{the woman has immediately put gale on the defensive. two other reporters have taken notice. suddenly, cameras are on gale.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{well, you know i'm dear to the subject matter.}
<C>__{debbie salt}
<D>__{and much richer as a result.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{do i know you? you look familiar.}
<C>__{debbie salt}
<D>__{i took your vulture seminar seminar at berkeley last year.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{good for you.}
<A>__{and in seconds the vultures are upon her as gale weathers is beseiged by reporters. the questions spew forth. "why are you here?" "is this the work of a copycat killer?" "have you talked to sidney?" etc.}
<C>__{gale}
<P>__{(ever smooth)}
<D>__{guys, you're missing the show.}
<A>__{and with that gale wanders off into the crowd.}
<B>__{on stage}
<A>__{the local sheriff, a smart looking guy in his 50's is fielding questions.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{no, we have no evidence of a serial killer. we think the killer acted deliberately and not at random...}
<B>__{on the lawn}
<A>__{students and concerned faculty stand. among them are sidney, derek, hallie and mickey. next to them stand joel, 20's, black, sensible and friendly. a very intelligent face.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{but what are they doing? he's talking but he's not saying anything.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{sounds like they don't know anything.}
<C>__{hallie}
<D>__{do you think they'll cancel hell week?}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{you're getting nailed you're not getting out of it.}
<A>__{from across the way, two gorgeous sorority type girls, lois and murphy stand with their fraternity jock boyfriends. all looks and attitude. their eyes are on sidney as they huddle in a conspiratory stance.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{have they questioned you yet, sid?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{this has nothing to do with me, joel. there's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the us at any given time. i can't control that. who's hungry?}
<C>__{hallie}
<D>__{i have rehearsal.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{i have to watch rehearsal.}
<A>__{hallie kicks him. joel moves to sid.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i gotta hit the library. anatomy. some of us have real majors. you gonna be okay, sid?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{you're not allowed to ask that.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i will stop by the deltas tonight.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{thanks, joel.}
<A>__{joel smiles, heading out as the two sorority girls, lois and murphy saunter over.}
<C>__{lois}
<D>__{hello, pledges. enjoying yourselves?}
<A>__{instantly, hallie stands at attention. sidney joins begrudgingly.}
<C>__{hallie}
<D>__{yes, sister lois. very much so. thank you for asking.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{good. we need your help, pledges. are you familiar with the deltas tp fundraiser?}
<A>__{the pledges shake their heads. suspicious. lois withdraws two rolls of toilet paper from her book bag and passes them out.}
<C>__{lois }
<D>__{in our efforts to raise money for our favorite cause...}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{... this week's tke kegger...}
<C>__{lois}
<D>__{ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{we've set you each at a five dollar quota.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{come on, guys. uncool.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{am i getting fraternity interference, mickey?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{it's okay. i can peddle toilet paper.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{sid, you don't have to.}
<A>__{sidney takes her toilet paper.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{no special treatment. i can do this. c'mon hallie.}
<A>__{she throws him a comforting glance. she's okay with this. she heads off with hallie. derek watches.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{how do you put up with this greek shit?}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{hey, it's cool. hallie's into it, i'm into hallie...}
<C>__{across the way}
<D>__{gale moves through the crowd as the press conference rally continues. she runs dead smack into...}
<B>__{dewey}
<A>__{their eyes meet. a long moment. the silence between them is revealing.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{hello, dwight.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{miss weathers.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{i've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{i'm on crowd patrol, miss weathers, excuse me.}
<A>__{he tips his hat curtly, then starts off. she stops him.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{the name's gale, remember'?}
<A>__{he turns on her. his eyes on fire.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{yes, miss weathers, your name is embedded clearly between my ears.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{i see you read the book.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{yes, i do retain reading skills. shock.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{and an explanation is, of course, out of the question.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{page 32. "deputy dewey filled the room with his dim witted barney fifish presence." i think you've explained yourself.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{oh dewey, i'm sorry.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{no, what you are is a money hungry, fame seeking liar and forgive me for saying mediocre writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be.}
<A>__{this stings gale.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{you have every right to be upset.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{page 41. "deputy dewey oozed with inexperience."}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{i never meant to imply...}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{how do you know my dim witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?}
<A>__{gale is at a loss.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i don't know what else to say except i'm sorry.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{no, i'm the one who's sorry. i misjudged you. now if you'll excuse me, i have some oozing to do.}
<A>__{dewey turns and limps away, leaving gale staring after him. her face smashed fiat.}
<B>__{on stage}
<A>__{the sheriff continues fielding questions from reporters.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{no, there has been no evidence that more than one killer is responsible...}
<B>__{across the way}
<A>__{sidney and hallie have split up. they move through the crowd selling toilet paper. several students make their purchase. sidney pockets her change, looks up to see gale, standing alone. she goes to her.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{hello, gale.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{sidney. hello. how are you?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{i'm okay. people magazine won't stop calling but other than that...}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{yeah, well... you are the definition of mixed emotions. i really should hate you... i see your movie's getting good reviews.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{it seems to be causing a stir. what's with the toilet paper?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{it's hell week. i'm pledging the deltas.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{it's good to see you involved.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{my morn was a delta.}
<A>__{beat. people have begun to notice the two of them talking. reporters and spectators have slowly circled them. gale looks around. she spots randy, who appears behind sid, with his camera. gale gives him the nod. he throws the camera up, hits the light. sid spins around, surprised to see him.}
<C>__{sidney }
<D>__{randy? what are you doing here?}
<A>__{but then she sees someone else, standing off to the side. a man she recognizes immediately. he looks at; her, his face sullen, broken. sidney loses her breath.}
<C>__{sidney }
<D>__{cotton...}
<A>__{he moves to her.}
<C>__{cotton}
<D>__{hello, sidney.}
<A>__{gale motions to randy. he maneuvers, getting the two of them in frame. a long moment, sidney just stares at him. completely off guard. she looks to randy who aims the camera directly at her... filming her.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{she turns back to gale, staring holes through her, realizing she's been set up. she looks back to cotton. she doesn't know what to say. she turns back to gale. eyes aflame.}
<C>__{sidney }
<D>__{you bitch!}
<A>__{sidney storms off, disappearing in the crowd. cotton turns to gale. his face pained.}
<C>__{cotton}
<D>__{this was a mistake. i shouldn't be here.}
<A>__{he takes off, pushing through the crowd. randy stops filming.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{can you say backfire?}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{did you get it?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{yeah, i got it.}
<A>__{randy is clearly not happy about his part in this. it's in his voice.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{you need to check your conscience at the door. we're not here to be loved.}
<A>__{randy's face reveals otherwise.}
<C>__{at the podium}
<D>__{the sheriff continues.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{no, we don't anticipate another murder but we are taking every precaution possible...}
