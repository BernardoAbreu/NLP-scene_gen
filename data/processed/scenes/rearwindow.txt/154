<L>__{exterior neighborhood night semi long shot}
<A>__{the salesman's apartment, just as we saw it a moment ago. the shades drawn and lights out in the bedroom, the shade up and lights on in the living room and kitchen. still no one in sight.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{well, "ain't i?" pay attention to me.}
<L>__{interior jeff's apartment night two shot}
<A>__{we are now able to see that jeff's apartment is in darkness, only faintly lit from the distant light of the neighbors' window. by her position, lisa is seated on jeff's sound knee, her arms around his neck.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i'm not exactly on the other side of the room.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{your mind is. and when i want a man, i want all of him.}
<A>__{she starts kissing him.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{don't you ever have any problems?}
<C>__{lisa}
<P>__{(murmurs, kissing him)}
<D>__{i have one now.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{so do i.}
<C>__{lisa}
<P>__{(kissing)}
<D>__{tell me about it.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(slight pause)}
<D>__{why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? and come back three times?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{he likes the way his wife welcomes him home.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{not that salesman's wife. and why didn't he go to work today?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{homework. it's more interesting.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{what's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{nothing, thank heaven.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(looking again)}
<D>__{why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i wouldn't dare answer that.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(after pause)}
<D>__{lisa there's something terribly wrong.}
<A>__{she gives up trying to interest him in romance, and moves back from the embrace. the camera pull back.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{and i'm afraid it's with me.}
<A>__{lisa stands, straightens out her dress, stretches a little then she turns to the divan, apparently not too interested in his observation about the salesman's life.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(looks at lisa)}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{lisa}
<P>__{(without returning his look)}
<D>__{something too frightful to utter.}
<A>__{jeff is thoughtful for a moment, then he relaxes and smiles a little. he turns to the window to look out again. lisa exits the picture.}
