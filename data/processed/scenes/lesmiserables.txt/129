<A>__{marius makes his way slowly up the stairs to the upper room. he's still weak from his wounds. he enters the room where his friends died, and looks round. he sinks into a chair.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{there's a grief that can't be spoken there's a pain goes on and on empty chairs at empty tables now my friends are dead and gone.}
<A>__{he sees the bloodstain on the wall beneath the window sill. the blood of enjolras.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{here they talked of revolution here it was they lit the flame here they sang about tomorrow}
<P>__{(more)}
<C>__{marius }
<D>__{and tomorrow never came... from the table in the corner they could see a world reborn and they rose with voices ringing and i can hear them now! the very words that they had sung became their last communion on the lonely barricade at dawn.}
<A>__{he looks out of the window at what's left of the barricade. he seems to see again the brave doomed defence, the smoke and the gunfire, the young men falling.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{oh my friends, my friends, forgive me that i live and you are gone there's a grief that can't be spoken there's a pain goes on and on... phantom faces at the window phantom shadows on the floor empty chairs at empty tables where my friends will meet no more. oh my friends, my friends, don't ask me what your sacrifice was for empty chairs at empty tables where my friends will sing no more.}
<A>__{slowly he rises from the chair and turns to the doorway. there stands cosette, waiting for him.}
