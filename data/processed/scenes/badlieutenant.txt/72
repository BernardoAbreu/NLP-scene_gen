<L>__{int: late night ariane's apartment}
<A>__{lt rushes in, triple bolts the door behind him. he immediately pulls the drapes.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{someone just took a shot at me...}
<A>__{ariane laughs.}
<C>__{ariane}
<D>__{sure, baby sure and you don't do cocaine, either.}
<A>__{lt turns on her. adamant. pleading with her to believe him.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{it's not the drugs, ariane, it's it's someone who wants to kill me.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you gotta believe me!}
<C>__{ariane}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{why?}
<A>__{ariane walks away, speaks with her back to lt.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{just kick back, baby. make yourself at home.}
<P>__{(suddenly pissed)}
<D>__{but of course it won't be nobody's home, if you don't come through with the fucking rent!}
<A>__{lt lays his coat down on the bed. puts the cigar box of money under it. lt sits down near the phone. he lights his crackpipe with a match from the matchbook on which lite wrote the bookie's number. then he tries to reach the bookie. some sort of wacky mob joint answers.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{hello? is large there?}
<C>__{mob voice}
<P>__{(oc)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{look, man. lite gave ne this number. ok? just take a message. tell large to fucking call me right away at 123 1234. got it?}
<C>__{mob voice}
<P>__{(co phony humble)}
<D>__{sure, i get it...}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{i'm a good friend of lite's, man. it's urgent that }
<A>__{the mob voice (co) hangs up on lt. lt tries to strangle the phone.}
<B>__{lt redials.}
<A>__{the line is busy.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{christ! shit! i could kill them all with my bare hands.}
<C>__{ariane}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{those fucking mob assholes.}
<A>__{lt makes the strangulation gesture again. ariane laughs at him.}
<C>__{ariane}
<D>__{c'mere. you got some good blow, right?}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{ariane}
<D>__{then c'mere. i got something for you.}
<A>__{ariane pulls out a pristine needle. lt comes but flinches at the sight. apparently bowtay overheard that drugs are on the way. bowtay appears out of the kitchen. bowtay sits down near by, awaiting her dose. ariane starts preparing the dose. she's got all the paraphernalia: spoon. cotton, a candle flame, etc.}
<C>__{ariane}
<D>__{first i will put your uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, i'm gonna add some downtown. they call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that...}
<P>__{(beat she leans in)}
<D>__{first time shooting up?}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{nah...}
<C>__{ariane}
<D>__{sure it is. you're a virgin. just like that nun. and i'm gonna rape you.}
<A>__{that decides it for lt. he sits down like a little boy and lets ariane shoot him up with the potent mixture of cocaine and heroin. ariane shoots up bowtay, nexterior they do it on the bed, exploiting all possible erotic connotations. when lt rushes, he gets totally paranoid. jumps at sounds, sneaks to the window, hears noises that aren't there. then he flips, and becomes crazy bold. opens the drapes. sticks his head out the window, waves his gun at specters. then he becomes shit scared, again. his behavior is lunatic. ariane laughs at his antics. finally lt becomes wildly sensual. revealing himself with total abandon. dances. in the midst of this the phone rings lt is seriously startled. then he realizes who it may be. he slowly answers the phone. lt can hardly speak. he is nude, and communicating from another world syllable by syllable.}
<C>__{lt}
<P>__{(into the phone)}
<D>__{large?}
<C>__{large}
<P>__{(oc)}
<D>__{all right, cop. i want my money.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{it's still my money. if you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.}
<C>__{large}
<P>__{(oc)}
<D>__{what about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{fuck yesterday's game. the world series is seven games not six. put in my bet.}
<C>__{large}
<P>__{(oc)}
<D>__{let me think about it.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{there's nothing to think about. either you put in my bet or you ain't getting nothing.}
<A>__{big silence on the phone.}
<C>__{large}
<P>__{(co lethal)}
<D>__{oh, really?}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{yeah, really. i'm no fucking asshole, man. i'm a fucking cop!}
<C>__{large}
<P>__{(oc)}
<D>__{ok, cop. i want you to give yourself and your friends on the force a message. tell them i've got my own reasons to be very interested in whomever did the job on the nuns. i will double the church reward if you bring those punks direct to me. 100 g cash. get it?}
<A>__{lt absorbs this, then bursts out.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{fuck the nuns, man! i'm talking about strawberry! is the bet down?}
<A>__{large takes a moment.}
<C>__{large}
<P>__{(oc)}
<D>__{here's the deal: you meet me tonight across from the garden. 33rd & 8th. at the beginning of the ninth inning. we'll listen to the end of the game together. you bring your cash, i will bring mine.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{yeah, sucker. you better be there!}
<A>__{lt hangs up, turns to ariane.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? he kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 g to bring in some guys who raped a nun. what a sick fuck. man...}
<C>__{ariane}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{a wiseguy. paying 100 grand for the rapists if i turn then over direct to him.}
<A>__{ariane's eyes light up.}
<C>__{ariane}
<D>__{but you could do it, baby. we could use the bread...}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{you mean you could use it.}
<A>__{ariane shrugs, waves his dig aside. lt leaps up. he's on a manic roll. conceives an insanely captivating, impossible idea. as he speaks, he speeds more and more until he seems to be reciting a rapid fire tongue twister perfect.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{i got it, man! i will find those kids. and i will get the 50 g from the church! then the kids'll go to jail. i will be in charge, of course. after a little while, i will break the fuckers out and i will turn them in to shithead i was just talking to. and pick up his 100 g. no. i will hit him up for 200 g. or 250 g. l can do it 'cause i've got the kids. then, of course, there's the 180 g i'm gonna pick up on the game tonight when the strawberries win!}
<C>__{ariane}
<D>__{"the strawberries"?}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{the mets. so anyway, chalk up another 180 g for the game. jesus christ! that's almost half a million dollars. ariane! wait. that's not good enough, i will ask the shithead for 280 g for the kids. then it'll be a perfect 500 thousand. yeah. perfect. 280 g for the kids. yeah, it's good i prepared, or i wouldn't have thought to }
<A>__{ariane has been grooving on it until now. she sees a problem they've overlooked.}
<C>__{ariane}
<P>__{(cuts in)}
<D>__{how come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the church haven't come up with shit? you got some kinda inside track?}
<C>__{lt}
<P>__{(nods dead serious)}
<D>__{i'm a catholic.}
<A>__{ariane laughs, decides to go with it. lt, out of breath from his tirade, lets the downtown half of his dose kick in but good. he sits down in the same easy chair in which he nodded out the morning of the desecration. nodding out, he stares out the same window. his eyes close. as it was that morning only four days ago, the sunrise is blood red. as if it is lt's dream, we }
