<L>__{exterior valley day}
<A>__{hector is tiring, too. with the girl still awkwardly clinging to his neck he is picking his way up a steep slope, half dragging the boy up behind him. he stops for a breath and sees the raiders moving into the valley below. in a moment of utter panic he lets go of his son, drops the girl from his shoulder, and runs on alone. we can sense the moment of release in his unburdened flight. but it doesn't last long. some way up the slope he stops and turns. he sees his children, only now beginning to work out what has happened, and the raiders below. he can't do it. even as the girl calls to him he is running back down the hill, feeling the first stab of a guilt that will never leave him.}
