<A>__{she stands in her bathrobe staring down at the tub. her dressing gown is buttoned to the neck as well.}

<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{yeah ... i'm just going to take a bath first.}
<B>__{closer. betty.}
<A>__{she swallows once as she stares down at the tub then reaches for the spigot and turns on the water. betty's heart beats a little faster as she hears the water thundering down.}
<B>__{closer still ...}
<A>__{betty reaches up and unties the little silk ribbon at the top of her robe. she slips it off, and lets it drop to the floor, standing naked in the middle of the bathroom. betty glances toward the mirror and then quickly glances away. she takes a deep breath and steps into the tub.}
<B>__{even tighter. on her face ...}
<A>__{betty slides down into the warm water, breathing in the steam, and closing her eyes for a moment. she lingers like that for a second or two, before settling a little lower in the tub. betty opens her eyes, but they only half open. there is the slight trace of a smile.}
