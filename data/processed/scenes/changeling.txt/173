<L>__{exterior union station day}
<A>__{a small crowd is assembled at the front of the station, where chief davis stands with the boy who had been "walter" as a train pulls up before them.}
<C>__{chief davis}
<D>__{ so after much effort, we were able to identify this boy, who was has been responsible for so much recent trouble, as arthur hutchins of cedar rapids, iowa. between this, and the arrest of the man suspected of murdering the real walter collins, we have cleared up two of the biggest mysteries in the history of los angeles.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i hope that you gentlemen of the press will give as much space to the good things we do as the mistakes that are made on rare occasions.}
<A>__{just then, he turns as a matron comes off the train with janet hutchins, middle thirties, the boy's mother.}
<C>__{chief davis}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce you to the boy's real mother, mrs. janet hutchins.}
<A>__{she goes to him and hugs him. "walter" looks like he wishes he were somewhere on mars. davis moves closer to them to be in frame while the flashbulbs pop. she's in the same pose as they got christine to take when she "accepted" her lost son.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{i hope he hasn't been too much trouble for you.}
<C>__{chief davis}
<D>__{oh, no, not at all....}
<A>__{he towsels the boy's head like he'd like to cut it off. then he nods to an aide, who approaches with a bundle of clothes.}
<C>__{wright}
<D>__{mrs. hutchins...mrs. collins, the woman he was staying with, wanted him to have these. they're the clothes she let him wear.}
<A>__{changeling a true story}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{well, thank you. isn't that nice, arthur? tell the nice officer thank you. "walter" i don't want 'em! give 'em to somebody else!}
<C>__{davis}
<D>__{precocious little fellow, isn't he? "walter" it's not my fault! it was the police! they said i was walter collins, not me! it wasn't my idea!}
<A>__{she yanks him away. davis smiles gamely at the reporters.}
<C>__{chief davis}
<D>__{there...blame the police for your own mistakes. we've seen a lot of that lately, haven't we?}
