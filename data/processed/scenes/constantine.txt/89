<A>__{but hennessey is on a quest. for food. and it's everywhere. he starts grabbing meals right off of plates. fish, pasta, prime rib. shovels it all in. patrons are yelling screaming. he's eating as if his life depended on it. and even though he's devouring anything in sight, this huge man is wasting away before our eyes. in the middle of all this chaos is one customer calmly eating his meal. balthazar. hennessey hijacks a food cart consumes everything on it yet his skin is getting looser and the body inside gets thinner. he grabs a steak from a woman's plate but she jerks it back so he bites into his arm. she screams as her husband pulls her away. hennessey's strength is withering away. desperate, he grabs a fork, digs it into his own hand. a hispanic busboy rushes into the room, grabs onto hennessey.}
