<L>__{exterior cemetery day}
<A>__{an inscription on a headstone reads:}
<C>__{hank aleno}
<D>__{remembered virtually forever}
<A>__{viktor kneels at hank's grave. he places a bunch of flowers there.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(referring to the flowers)}
<D>__{they're plastic, hank. i know that's the way you'd want it.}
<P>__{(glancing to a simone}
<D>__{billboard outside the}
<P>__{cemetery wall)}
<D>__{she killed you, hank. now she's killing me. she's a serial killer.}
<P>__{(ducking out of sight of}
<D>__{the billboard as if}
<P>__{simone is watching him)}
<D>__{but i don't know how to stop her. she's taken on a life of her own. i can't just come clean make some confession. i've defrauded millions they'd turn on me. and i can't put the genie back in the bottle. if she stopped working dropped out of sight, they'd never let it rest. i've tried to kill her career but they like her even more.}
<P>__{(more desperate)}
<D>__{what am i going to do, hank?}
<A>__{a thought occurs to viktor. he slowly rises from behind hank's headstone, revealing a forest of headstones.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{don't say another word, hank. you are truly a genius.}
