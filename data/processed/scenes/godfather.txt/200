<L>__{ext day: mall (1955)}
<B>__{high angle on the corleone mall}
<A>__{silence. the flower cars, funeral limousines, and private cars fill all the areas attendant to the corleone residence. hundreds of people fill the mall, reminiscent in size of the wedding of connie and carlo; of course, now the mood is somber and respectful. michael, mama, fredo and hagen stand by the flowered platform which holds the ornate coffin. we cannot see the remains of don corleone. bonasera is nearby, ready to do service to the bereaved family. one by one the mourners come by, weeping, or merely with grave expressions; pay their respects and continue on. the view alters, and we see that the line is endless. johnny fontane, tears openly falling, takes his turn. children are taken by the hand, and lifted for their last look at the great man. clemenza whispers into the ear of lampone. lampone immediately arranges for the members of the five new york families to pay their respects. first cuneo, then strachi and then zaluchi. then philip tattaglia, who merely passes by the coffin. then barzini in a black homburg, standing a long time. michael watches the scene. barzini crosses himself and passes on, immediately rejoined by his men. as barzini leaves, it seems as though everyone is fawning on him; perhaps asking for favors: but at any rate, it is clear from the doors opened for him, the cigars lit for him, that he is the new capo di capi the place formerly held by don corleone. michael watches silently. barzini is searching for somebody with his eyes. first clemenza. then tessio. connie rushes into michael's arms, tears in her eyes. he embraces and comforts her. everywhere michael goes, neri is a few feet away watching all who come close to him.}
