<A>__{a simple, classic wedding dress hangs on a closet door in this sun drenched bridal suite. sitting at the makeup table, surrounded by her bridesmaids, is the beautiful bride, tracy turner, 20's. she's busy doing her makeup. just then, tracy's rich, stern father, 50's, blows in.}

<C>__{vick}
<D>__{tracy, it's vick.}
<A>__{parked on the dirt road behind vick is his near totalled 1967 cadillac deville convertible; it's scratched, dented, filthy and missing its passenger side door. slouched inside are two other guys, also looking like hell.}

<C>__{vick}
<D>__{listen, honey...the bachelor party got a little out of control and, well...we lost doug.}

<D>__{dude this is already the best weekend ever!}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{stu, relax, we're still on the 10.}

<D>__{oh, did i show you pictures of my kids?!}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{no, dude, show `em.}
<A>__{stu fishes pictures out of his wallet and eagerly shows them to doug in the front seat. doug is clearly the core of this group, the glue that holds these childhood friends together.}

<D>__{hey so alan, are you and becky still together?}
<A>__{but before alan can answer }
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{of course they are, doug. jesus, alan's been dating becky for 14 years. when they first met, alan had braces and soccer hair, and becky had a functioning hymen.}
<C>__{vick }
<D>__{asking alan if he's still with becky is like asking the sun if it still rises in the east.}
<A>__{the guys try not to laugh; alan scowls.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{she still pressuring you to get married?}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{enh, we've moved past the pressure stage...it's more like aggravated assault stage now? like at the last wedding we went to, she threw a camera at my head, called me a closet fag, then ran out crying.}
<A>__{the guys wince, oooo.}
<C>__{alan }
<D>__{but we talked, and everything's cool now.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{maybe you could wear a helmet to doug's wedding.}

<D>__{oh, great. yeah, i'm working on bringing the next big dessert craze to los angeles. it's gonna be huge.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{bavarian custard. we ran the numbers, and it's gonna be bigger than fro yo.}
<A>__{doug and stu nod, impressed; only alan looks skeptical.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{isn't custard like a trillion calories ?}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{our plan is to open three stores in the valley and then franchise it. shares are selling fast, but i can probably squeeze you guys in...}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{yeah, man, count me in.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{me too, man! i love pudding!}
<A>__{alan just shakes his head, unbelievable.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{is this gonna do better than the hip hop label you started, vick? or the topless sushi bar? or the mobile tattoo parlor ?}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{tattoo to you was an idea ahead of it's time, alan! and don't come crying to me when there's a custard cabana on every street corner in america and you didn't buy in !}

<A>__{vick and alan quiet. stu is still drumming the seat.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{dude! i can't believe i get to party all night, and then, tomorrow ...i get to sleep in! it's almost too much! and fyi, if anyone gets really drunk and craps themself, just let me know, i can have you cleaned up and partying again in under three minutes. no joke. i am a master of stool removal...}

<D>__{hey stu.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{hey guys. doug! doug !}
<A>__{then stu registers what just happened. he stops and turns around enh? but the gay men are gone. before he can comment, however, he sees vick and alan talking to atashir at}
<B>__{the reception desk}
<A>__{he slowly bow legs himself over.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{you find doug?}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{no, i assume you didn't either?}
<A>__{stu shakes his head, no. then atashir hangs up his phone.}
<C>__{atashir}
<D>__{there is no doug billings at any of the area hospitals, morgues, or police stations.}
<A>__{the guys frown, starting to grow worried.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{maybe he went for a jog?}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{dude. it's 120 degrees outside.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{or shopping?}
<A>__{the guys just look at him like: you're an idiot.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{great. so we've officially lost doug. his wedding is in what, 22 hours?}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{relax, it's doug, he's probably crashed out on someone's couch right now. all we have to do is retrace our steps from last night, and we'll find him.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{okay, so last night...}
<A>__{the guys wince, trying to remember. it's painful to think.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{well, we started on the roof...}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{right, that was like, 6ish...?}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{then...i think...we had steaks at the palm?}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{yeah. then...we played craps at the hard rock...maybe?}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{that sounds right...}
<A>__{stu throws up his arms, already giving up.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{okay, honestly? i don't even remember going to dinner.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{i vaguely recall...doing body shots ....at some point? is that...maybe?}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{i'm pretty much blank after the hard rock.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{i think we went to the flamingo after that...? and then, i just remember a lot of blue light...and the overpowering smell of baby oil.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{so that was what, 10ish?}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{give or take.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{was doug still with us?}

<D>__{yes. yes. doug was with us. i tackled him...for some reason.}
<A>__{the guys nod, okay, okay.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{okay. so we only have a 13 hour window where we could've lost him.}
<A>__{they guys frown. shit. stu puts his hands into his pockets, thinking... then he feels something. a matchbook. he pulls it out. it's from the flamingo nightclub.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{hey! look, we were at the flamingo.}
<A>__{a long beat of silence... then the guys hurry to an empty blackjack table and start emptying their pockets of the detritus from the night before. they find matchbooks, receipts, room keys, a valet ticket...}

<D>__{i think we should call tracy.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{absolutely not.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{what if doug called her? she might know where he is.}
<A>__{stu shifts uncomfortably, tenderly adjusting his ass.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{yeah, i'm with alan on this one.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{of course you're with alan, you're both gutless cowards. but we're not calling tracy. you never call the bride from the bachelor party. ever. if my balls were on fire and tracy was sitting next door with a tall glass of water, i still wouldn't call her. it's a rule.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{but shouldn't we at least tell her we're gonna be getting home late?}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{she has a watch, she'll figure it out.}

<P>__{(finally realizing)}
<D>__{oh! oh! oh!}
