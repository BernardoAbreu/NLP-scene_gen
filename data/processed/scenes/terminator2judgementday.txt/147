<L>__{66d up ahead we hear typing. the night nurse has her back to us, working.}
<A>__{the guard stops as the drinking fountain. bends to take a sip. behind him the fluid mass as reaches six feet of height and begins to resolve rapidly into a human figure. it loses the color and texture of the tile and becomes... the guard. t 1000's mass has been spread out a quarter of an inch thick over several square yards of floor. the guard walked over the t 1000, and his structure was sampled that instant. now we see it drawing in and pulling up to form the figure of the guard. the t 1000 guard's feet are the last to form, the last of the "liquid floor" pulling in to form shiny black guard shoes. the shoes detach with a faint sucking sound from the real floor as the t 1000 guard takes its first step.}
