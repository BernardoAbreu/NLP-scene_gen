<A>__{ferris is standing at the urinal.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{she's a person who views life as an ordeal that must be endured. her body is a transport vehicle for her anger. i don't know where she gets this shit. basically, the family's pretty cool.}
<A>__{he looks down at the urinal.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{i wonder if everybody shoots at cigarette butts in urinals? probably not many women.}
<P>__{(continues)}
<D>__{i used to think that my family was the only one that had weirdness in it. it used to worry me. then i met cameron and i saw how his family functioned.}
<A>__{he zips this trousers and steps away from the urinal.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{cameron's home life is really shit. he wasn't lying. that's why he's sick all the time. it really upsets him. what he said about his parents hating each other? i refuse to sleep over at his house. his parents fight all the time. even when i'm there. is there anything worse than being at somebody's house when their parents are fighting? it's the absolute height of social discomfort.}
<A>__{he checks his hair in the mirror.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{when they go after each other, cameron tightens up. it's scary. he gets so wadded up, you couldn't pry his buns apart with a crowbar. the thing with taking his old man's car? it's good for him. it teaches him to deal with his fear. plus, and i must be honest here, i love driving it. i highly recommend picking one up.}
<A>__{he exists the men's room. we hold a beat. a toilet flushes. another beat and tom walks out of the stall. he crosses to the sink.}
