<L>__{exterior field day.}
<A>__{the black men work...sledge hammers in hand... as they work, miraculously, they sing.."they sing about the women they knew, the children they had been...they sing of bosses and masters and misses...of mules and dogs and the shamelessness of life...they sing of sisters long gone. they sing love songs to death."}
<L>__{interior trench night.}
<A>__{a torrential downpour. the men in the wooden cages watch the rain filling the trench, corroding the red dirt wall around them. bugs and human debris swirl around their legs and feet. mud covering them through the cracks of the scrap lumber roof. some finds rest. other's minds are long gone. camera finds paul...he is screaming. but there is no sound coming from his mouth. tears flow down his face, but when he touches them, he realizes; they are tears of mud. he looks up and the wooden planked roof is breaking under the power of the rain..he looks down and the water is up to his thighs. suddenly, the chain linking his feet is pulled and he is knocked down..he gets up, searches through the mud for the chain and notices it's slack..he pulls as well.... one by one the men in the boxes realize the chain's end is being undone by the rain, as camera tracks down towards the last box to the dirt wall, into which the chain has been locked...it is giving way within the muddy wall.}
<B>__{the men break through the rotted wood roofs to freedom...}
<A>__{wide angle; as the men climb out of the muddy coffins, grasping for a hold, crawling with every muscle of their bodies to get out of the trench before mud and water drown them.... paul climbs with the will of ten men, with every ounce of strength he has left... end of memory.}
