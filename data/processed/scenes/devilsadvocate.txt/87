<L>__{exterior canal street (chinatown) day (little later)}
<A>__{a street food stall. milton paying for kevin's eggroll. and they're walking...}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{best street food in the world. try that. tell me it isn't great.}
<P>__{(as kevin eats)}
<D>__{new york. what a scene, right?}
<C>__{milton }
<D>__{guy like moyez living in that subterranean shithole all the time he's running around with fifteen million dollars in the bank.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{you gotta be kidding.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{what do you think? we're giving you away? he's paying us in goat's blood? i'm billing you out at four hundred an hour, my friend. i don't see a whole lot of pro bono work in your immediate future.}
<P>__{(buzzing here)}
<D>__{seriously, what i like, you got in there with him. inside the cage. that's instinct. can't be taught. you gotta hear that on your own. it's gotta be in your blood. it's molecular. i bet i've got five thousand lawyers working around the planet. i couldn't name ten couldn't name three i'd trust with moyez.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{so what the hell are they doing?}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{what are they doing? they're corporate lawyers, what do you think they're doing? they're busy reducing life and death to the proper position of a semi colon. they're doing needlepointerior push button battles. push button wars. armies that get so fucking far away from each other they need satellites to tell them who won. no pain. no sound. no smell. one big, multinational circle jerk. you, on the other hand, you're on the slaughterhouse floor. you can't help but smell your clients.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{i figure you came to court to make sure i didn't fuck this up.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{maybe i did. but don't get too cocky. no matter how good you are. don't let them see you coming. that's the gaff, my friend make yourself small. be the hick. the cripple. the nerd. the leper. the shit kicking surfer. look at me i've been underestimated from day one. do i look like a master of the universe? that's your only weakness as far as i can tell.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{the look. the florida stud thing. 'scuse me, ma'am, did i leave my boots under your bed?'}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{never worked a jury didn't have a woman.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{you know what you're missing? what i have? this beautiful girl she's just fucked me every way she knows how we're done she's walking to the bathroom she turns back and there i am. it's me. and she smiles it's like a veil coming down across her face and that smile, that's a question mark, because she's looking at me, she's wondering, how did that happen? and see, right there, from that moment on, she's got a secret. i'm the hand up mona lisa's skirt. i'm the whisper in nefertitti's ear. i'm a surprise. they never see me coming. that's what you're missing.}
<A>__{milton escaping across the street.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{so why did you come down today?}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{because i knew it was gonna be good. because i knew i was gonna like it. that you would shine that we would take this walk that we'd really talk. why i came down? you want the truth? i'm an aging, hipster plutocrat. i came up from nothing. from dirt. i'm warming my hands on your talent }
<P>__{(distracted then )}
<D>__{where's the chicken?}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{a chinese man sits in a doorway }
<C>__{milton}
<P>__{(perfect cantonese)}
<D>__{where's the chicken? the chicken that plays tic tac toe. he used to be right here.}
<C>__{chinese man}
<P>__{(cantonese)}
<D>__{no, you passed it. back that way.}
<C>__{milton}
<P>__{(back to kevin, as they walk)}
<D>__{there's a chicken, he's famous, he plays tic tac toe. he never loses.}
<P>__{(suddenly)}
<D>__{hey. like you. right?}
<P>__{(catching himself)}
<D>__{look, i'm rambling because i'm excited. you're in the part of the game i like best. the realm of the true believers. you are a believer, aren't you?}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{i believe in the presumption of innocence.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{better a hundred guilty men go free than a single innocent be executed.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{something like that.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{no. exactly like that. it's faith. you're either in or out. you can't believe a little bit.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{i was kidding.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{you're not here to amuse me. see, that's why people hate lawyers. so many of us have lost our faith. don't let that happen to you. token?}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<A>__{milton offering a token. behind him, the entrance to the canal street station }
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{learn the subways, kevin. use them. stay in the trenches.}
<A>__{kevin taking the token, as we }
