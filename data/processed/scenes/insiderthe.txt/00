<A>__{and we're in a speeding soviet jeep... two men in front, shouldering assault rifles. hezbollah soldiers... and there are three men in the back. a middle aged man wearing a tired suit and tinted sunglasses trying to hold on. and on either side of him, two men, blindfolded. the man on one side is in his forties, hands pressed in the pockets of a well travelled black leather jacket... a stocky man, with the edge of a j.d. salinger character, he's seen everything at least once. but even he has lost some of his self confidence, here, turning his head, sensing the wind, a blast of arabic music that disappears behind him... he's lowell bergman. on the other side of the man in the tired suit is a lanky man with a voltmeter around his neck, norman.}
