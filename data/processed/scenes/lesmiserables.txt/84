<L>__{interior valjean's house, rue plumet night}
<A>__{cosette is pacing in her bedroom. it's a pretty room, the best room in this small summer house. her shutters are open, giving a view of a wild unkempt garden. she looks at herself in a mirror, aware of her looks perhaps for the first time.}
<C>__{cosette}
<D>__{how strange this feeling that my life's begun at last! this change can people really fall in love so fast? what's the matter with you, cosette? have you been too much on your own? so many things unclear so many things unknown... in my life there are so many questions and answers that somehow seem wrong. in my life there are times when i catch in the silence the sigh of a faraway song and it sings of a world that i long to see out of reach just a whisper away waiting for me! does he know i'm alive? do i know if he's real?}
<P>__{(more)}
<C>__{cosette }
<D>__{does he see what i see? does he feel what i feel? in my life i'm no longer alone now the love in my life is so near... find me now! find me here!}
<A>__{valjean knocks and opens her door. he closes her shutters.}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{dear cosette, you're such a lonely child. how pensive, how sad you seem to me. believe me, were it within my power i'd fill each passing hour. how quiet it must be, i can see, with only me for company.}
<C>__{cosette}
<D>__{there's so little i know that i'm longing to know of the man that you were in a time long ago... there's so little you say of the life you have known, why you keep to yourself, why we're always alone. so dark! so dark and deep, the secrets that you keep! in my life please forgive what i say you are loving and gentle and good. but papa, dear papa, in your eyes i am still like that child who was lost in a wood.}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{no more words no more words. it's a time that is dead. there are words that are better unheard, better unsaid.}
<C>__{cosette}
<D>__{in my life i'm no longer a child and i yearn for the truth that you know of the years... years ago!}
<A>__{valjean leaves and goes into his own bedroom. a simple wooden shack at the back of the summerhouse, valjean himself lives with spartan simplicity he has given the best room to cosette. cosette follows. valjean sits on his bed, his back to cosette.}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{you will learn. truth is given by god to us all in our time, in our turn.}
