<L>__{interior exterior nelson's house evening}
<A>__{a big graduation party in progress. but ted sits in the corner, looking sad, dejected. julie didn't show up. he blew it. jimmy and charlie approach, with cheering on their minds.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{why so melancholy?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you were born naked, wet, and hungry. now you're hip, handsome, and rich. you are the coxswain on the ship of life.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{eat, drink, and screw mary!}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(proudly)}
<D>__{i taught him that.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{great.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{from my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. you scored big.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you got everything you ever wanted.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{except the girl. the only one that really mattered.}
<C>__{julie }
<D>__{and who might that be? miss july? miss august?}
<A>__{ted turns to find julie. his faces brightens with hope.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{julie, wow. i was afraid you left. i was afraid i'd never see you again.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i'm not going anywhere, ted. you're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i decided to let helen run the magazine. i need to go to college, learn a few things, you know.}
<A>__{julie seems pleased.}
<C>__{ted }
<D>__{and i thought maybe i'd take up boating. i've always wanted to be a "coxswain."}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{very ambitious. i like that.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{the thing is, i will need a first mate.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board.}
<A>__{all kidding aside, he speaks from the heart...}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{julie, you were right. all the naked girls in the world mean nothing. it's the one you want to cover up with your coat that you really love.}
<A>__{julie smiles...}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{planet ted. five years from now. what's happening?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i graduated from college. did great, summa cum laude and all. and i'm about to launch a brand new magazine called "exposed!" an homage to miss julie conroy of xenia, ohio.}
<A>__{julie grins.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i know where you can find an excellent editor in chief.}
<C>__{ted}

<C>__{ted}
<D>__{they're playing our song.}

<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i'm a sucker for a happy ending.}
<P>__{(hugging jimmy)}
<D>__{hold me.}
<A>__{and we start to rise again, above the nelson house, into the clouds above xenia...}
<C>__{ted }
<D>__{so, as you can guess, everybody pretty much lived happily ever after. my parents didn't give up the grocery store...}
<A>__{we descend through clouds and quickly find we're...}
