<A>__{atwood gets in and presses the key for her destination, then slumps into a corner for the ride. the doors close. the elevator begins to move. all at once atwood screams. her pent up anger and frustration rip the air and she goes nuts. she punches the wall of the elevator, kicks it, throws herself to the other side, bangs her head against that wall, punches it, kicks it, all the while screaming. then the tears come. the screams stop and she settles upright against the back wall, where she strikes her chest repeatedly with the flat of her closed hand.}
