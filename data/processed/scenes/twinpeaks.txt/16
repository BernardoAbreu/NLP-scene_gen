<C>__{desmond}
<D>__{good afternoon, federal bureau of investigation, special agent chet desmond. i'd like to see sheriff cable.}
<A>__{cliff just smiles for a long minute.}
<C>__{cliff}
<D>__{why don't you folks have a seat. make yourself at home. it's gonna be a while.}
<A>__{desmond stays standing and stanley sits. after another long moment, cliff joins the secretary in a conspiratorial giggle over the long wait they are planning to give the fbi. in the middle of a giggle cliff smiles up at desmond.}
<C>__{cliff }
<D>__{why don't you have some of that coffee. it was fresh two days ago.}
<A>__{cliff has a good laugh over this and leans again over the secretary pretending to look at some paper work. they both laugh.}
<C>__{desmond}
<D>__{okay, that's it. i've had enough of the waiting room now.}
<C>__{cliff}
<P>__{(still smiling)}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{desmond walks towards the door that obviously must go to sheriff cable's office. cliff blocks his way with his arm across the doorway, daring him to do something. while they stare eye to eye, desmond's hand goes up slowly towards cliff's face in a slow mesmerizing way. cliff tries to knock chet's hand away. chet counters by grabbing cliff's nose and pinches a nerve to its side injecting cliff with a great amount of pain.}
<C>__{cliff }
<D>__{aaahhhhhhhh...}
<A>__{desmond spins the deputy 180 degrees placing himself on the inside of the office and then still pressing the nerve guides cliff down into a chair. while the deputy's eyes tear copiously desmond turns to the secretary.}
<C>__{desmond}
<D>__{you can start that fresh pot of coffee right now.}
<A>__{desmond stalks to sheriff cable's office. stanley remains behind continuing to observe every detail.}
