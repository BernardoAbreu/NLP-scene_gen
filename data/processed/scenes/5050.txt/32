<L>__{interior coffee shop morning}
<A>__{adam and seth stand on an endless line of business men and women waiting for their morning coffee. greg is at the front of that line he's taking forever to decide what he wants. adam impatiently looks at his watch.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{what's taking him so long? how hard is it to buy a cup of coffee?}
<A>__{seth ignores adam as he stares at the cleavage on the woman behind him.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(quietly to adam)}
<D>__{look at how tight that shirt is. she's totally aware of how large her breasts look too. this morning when she got dressed, she said to herself "i have these things and i want the world to see them."}
<A>__{greg looks up at the menu of endless options.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{what about that frozen drink, what's that like?}
<C>__{barista}
<P>__{(enthusiastic)}
<D>__{the bavarian blender. it's absolute heaven.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{i don't know. does it have a lot of sugar?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{we've been here 20 minutes. what's he shopping for a car?}
<A>__{seth's eyes are still fixed on the woman's breasts.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{why are you in such a rush?}
<A>__{adam looks around at all the stodgy business men all having menial conversations.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{is this really how you want to spend the rest of your life? wasting away in this place?}
<A>__{greg still hasn't made up his mind. adam snaps.}
<C>__{adam }
<D>__{i don't believe it. why can't he just get a latte like he does every morning.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{relax. we have plenty of time.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{no we don't have plenty of time! life is finite.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{what the fuck is wrong with you?}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{i have cancer.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{yeah right.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i'm serious.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{get the fuck out of here. you have cancer?}
<A>__{people in line look at seth.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{maybe a little louder, you can make a special announcement.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{when did this happen?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{yesterday. they found a tumor in my spine.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{who?}

<D>__{i'm telling you now.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{if i had cancer i'd tell you right away.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{what do you want the better friend award? it's not an easy topic to bring up.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{holy shit!}
<A>__{seth takes a deep breath. a look of panic sweeps across his face...he quickly shakes it off.}
<C>__{seth }
<D>__{okay, let's relax here.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i think the best thing to do is to look on the bright side.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{the bright side of what?}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(emphatically)}
<D>__{this is your chance to do all the things you've always wanted. this is it. this is your time to live it up.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{plus, do you know how much pussy we're going to get?}
