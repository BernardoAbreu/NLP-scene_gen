<A>__{alison stands on a scale while dr. howard's nurse weighs her.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{you know what? maybe i should take my shoes off. or my belt buckle. my belt buckle's huge.}
<C>__{dr. howard's nurse}
<D>__{don't worry about gaining weight. your baby wants you to gain a whole mess of weight.}
<A>__{ben walks into the room, winded.}
<C>__{alison}
<P>__{(to ben)}
<D>__{are you fucking kidding me?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{why don't you take off your earrings, too? they weigh about eighty pounds. they're made out of moon rocks aren't they?}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{do not make fun of me. okay? i am hormonal, i am terrified, and i am falling apart, so stop treating everything like it's a big joke!}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i'm sorry you're freaking out, but i just walked three fucking miles through koreatown to get here. sorry if i'm trying to lighten the mood a little.}
<A>__{the nurse leaves.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{well, don't! okay?! you can't take anything seriously! you didn't even read the baby books.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i didn't read the baby books! what's gonna happen? how did anyone ever give birth without a baby book?! knocked up 94.}
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{that's right, the ancient egyptians fucking engraved "what to expect when you're expecting" on the pyramid walls! i forgot about that! who gives a flying fuck about the baby books?!}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{it just shows your lack of commitment, ben! that you're not in this with me!}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{did you just say my lack of commitment? because that's what it sounded like. it almost seems as though you forgot i proposed to you like an asshole! and you said no to me!}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{if you feel that way, you should just go. really. just go. because we didn't mean to do this together, okay? and, and we tried to make it work and that was good, i suppose.}
<A>__{alison holds back tears.}
<C>__{alison }
<D>__{but it doesn't work. because we are two completely different people. and i think it would just be easier for both of us if we stop fooling ourselves.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you know what? i know this isn't you talking, it's your hormones, but i would just like to say, "fuck you, hormones! you are a crazy bitch, hormones! not alison! hormones!" fuck them. it's a girl. buy some pink shit!}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{nice. you are such an asshole. you know what? go fuck your fucking bong, you fuck!}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i will fuck my bong. doggie style, for once.}
<A>__{ben exits while giving alison the finger as her walks away. dr. howard's nurse returns.}
<C>__{dr. howard's nurse}
<D>__{are you ready?}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{i'm really sorry about all that. that was really inappropriate.}
<C>__{dr. howard's nurse}
<D>__{that's okay. it happens all the time here. it's fine. knocked up 95.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{i don't feel so stupid, then.}
<C>__{dr. howard's nurse}
<D>__{not at all.}
