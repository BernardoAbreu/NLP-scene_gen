<A>__{eponine crumples up the letter. she walks sadly away down the street. rain is just starting to fall.}
<C>__{eponine}
<D>__{and now i'm all alone again nowhere to turn, no one to go to. without a home, without a friend,}
<P>__{(more)}
<C>__{eponine }
<D>__{without a face to say hello to. the city goes to bed and i can live inside my head. on my own pretending he's beside me all alone i walk with him till morning without him i feel his arms around me and when i lose my way i close my eyes and he has found me.}
<A>__{she crosses a bridge over the river.}
<C>__{eponine}
<D>__{in the rain the pavement shines like silver all the lights are misty in the river in the darkness the trees are full of starlight and all i see is him and me forever and forever! and i know it's only in my mind that i'm talking to myself and not to him. and although i know that he is blind, still i say there's a way for us. i love him but when the night is over he is gone the river's just a river. without him the world around me changes the trees are bare and everywhere the streets are full of strangers. i love him but every day i'm learning all my life i've only been pretending. without me, his world will go on turning a world that's full of happiness that i have never know. i love him i love him i love him but only on my own.}
<A>__{her solitary journey has brought her to the gorbeau slum. she goes inside.}
