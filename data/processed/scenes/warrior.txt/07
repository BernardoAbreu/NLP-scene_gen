<L>__{exterior brendan and tess' home, philadelphia day}
<A>__{a chaotic birthday party in the back yard of a middle class home in the suburbs of philly. a cluster of 5 year olds run about, some whacking at a pinata hanging from a tree, some whizzing down a large blow up slide, some getting their faces painted by a make up artist dressed like a gypsy. tess conlon (29) bounces around the yard, multi tasking like a champion and filming the proceedings with a video camera. she trains the camera on brendan conlon (30), who sits in a lawn chair in a scarf, hat, and women's make up. through video camera lens: two girls, emily (5), who wears a birthday girl crown, and rosie (3), mimic the make up woman}

<D>__{well, i'm not sure, but i think daddy is now a princess.}
<A>__{tess laughs. brendan looks at her with a "help me out here" expression.}
<C>__{tess}
<D>__{em, you want to open your presents?}
<A>__{the make over ends abruptly at the mention of "presents." emily, little sister in tow, runs over to a table filled with gifts as parents and children gather around. brendan gets out of the lawn chair and follows tess over to the gift table. amidst all the presents is one box, covered in pink wrapping paper, that is far larger than the rest.}

<D>__{it's her birthday.}
<A>__{tess turns the video camera toward brendan again. he couldn't look more ridiculous. and he obviously didn't clear the gift with his wife. he grins at her as she lowers the camera.}

<D>__{i know, but that's why you call it a budget. you set it, and you don't budge.}
