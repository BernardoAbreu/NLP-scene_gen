<A>__{janie (aged eight) is seated at the piano playing "hark, the herald angels sing," which she practices during the remainder of this scene. there is a christmas tree all decorated near the fireplace. at a large table mary is busy putting cellophane bows and decorations on gift packages. at a small table pete (aged nine) is seated with pad and pencil in the throes of composition. on the floor tommy (aged three) is playing with a toy vacuum cleaner. we hear the sound of a door open and close. mary turns and sees george enter the hall, a slight powdering of snow on his head and shoulders.}
