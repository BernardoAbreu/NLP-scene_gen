<D>__{may i walk with you?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{i'm sure your country doesn't have any laws about sharing a pavement.}
<A>__{as they walk the sound of the piano filters out of the rehearsal room window and down onto the lot.}
<L>__{interior rehearsal room morning}
<A>__{dick is playing about with a verse.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{go back to the chorus. dick & bob}
<P>__{(singing it incorrectly)}

<A>__{dick is confused.}
<C>__{bob }
<D>__{so go up.}
<A>__{dick plays a high note.}
<C>__{bob }
<D>__{try b.}
<A>__{he takes a pencil from behind his ear and marks dick's sheet music. dick immediately begins finding the tune on the piano}
<D>__{dick & bob}
<P>__{(singing `down' in an up key)}
<D>__{just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.}
<A>__{don looks up from his sketching.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{yes!}
<A>__{the sound of walt's cough signals his imminent arrival.}
<C>__{don}
<D>__{man is in the forest.}
<A>__{pamela and walt enter the room.}
<C>__{don }
<P>__{(to walt)}
<D>__{i want you to hear this.}
<P>__{(to the boys)}
<D>__{play him what you got.}
<A>__{walt takes a seat beside the piano. pamela folds her arms across her chest defiantly.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{it's just a chorus }
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{tell us what you think. he knows dum dum will help dum dum dum duuuum!}
<A>__{bob whistles what will end up being the robin's part of the song.}
<C>__{dick}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down the medicine go do own, medicine go down just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down in a most de da dee daaa!}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{we'll work out the other lyrics.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{you see how it goes up on the word down?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{on the word down it goes up!}
<C>__{pamela}
<P>__{(unhappy)}
<D>__{up.}
<C>__{don}
<D>__{it's ironic.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{is it?}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{forget ironic, it's iconic.}
<A>__{pamela rolls her eyes.}
<C>__{pamela}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{bravo.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{i won't be able to stop singing that for weeks!}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{it seems enormously patronising to me. the very sort of annoying tune you would have playing in your themed park i daresay. all giddy and carefree, encouraging children to face the world unarmed. all they need is a spoon and some sugar and a brain full of fluff and they're equipped with life's tools. wonderful!}
<A>__{dick is completely deflated.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{what's your point pam?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{mrs travers! my point is that, unlike yourself, mary poppins is the very enemy of sentiment and whimsy. she is truthful, she doesn't sugar coat the darkness in the world that these children will eventually come to know. she prepares them for it, she deals in honesty. one must clean one's room; it won't magically do it itself!}
<A>__{she waves the script in the air.}
<C>__{pamela }
<D>__{this whole script is flim flam! where is its reality? where is its heart, where is the gravitas?}
<A>__{she opens a window and flings the script out.}
<C>__{pamela }
<D>__{no weight mister disney! see?}
<A>__{dick, don and bob look out of the window as the pages flutter downwards and spread themselves over the disney lot.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{no whimsy or sentiment says the woman who sends a flying nanny with a talking umbrella to save the children.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{you think mary poppins is saving the children mr disney?}
<A>__{pamela sighs, shakes her head.}
<C>__{pamela }
<D>__{oh dear.}
