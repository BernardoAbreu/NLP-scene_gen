<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{wes}
<A>__{wes catches the coin. he turns it over in his fingers. he smiles, and there's nothing pleasant about it.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{jaeger and epps}
<A>__{epps yells up.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{wes, thrown down a pack.}
<A>__{a beat later an empty pack comes falling down. epps picks it up and takes it over to jaeger. the two of them start loading the coins into it.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i don't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins.}
<P>__{(yelling up.)}
<D>__{wes!? we'll send the gold up, then me and jaeger'll climb back.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{ready when you are.}
<A>__{epps is just about to attach the pack of gold to the line when jaeger grabs his arm.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{wait.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{jaeger isn't sure how to say what he's thinking.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{we send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{he's not going to leave us.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{what's to stop him if he wanted to? all he has to do is cut the line...}
<A>__{good pointerior what is to stop him?}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{you ready?}
<C>__{epps}
<P>__{(to jaeger)}
<D>__{all right. i will go up, then you send up the gold and }
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{why do i have to stay down here?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{jesus, jaeger.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i don't see how that plan's any better.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{someone's got to send the gold up. it can't get on the line by itself.}
<C>__{jager}
<D>__{why's it got to be me?}
<A>__{a tense moment passes.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{what are you doing? you ready?}
<A>__{another moment, then:}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{all right. you go up, i will send up the gold, then follow.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{yeah. yeah, that'll work.}
<A>__{jaeger goes over to the line and hooks himself on. he's just about ready to climb up when epps stops him. serious as a heart attack he says:}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{if you're even thinking about leaving me down here, you better think again.}
<A>__{jaeger stares at epps for a beat, then laughs himself a little laugh. he yells up:}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{wes, i'm coming up.}
<A>__{jaeger starts to climb as wes helps out by pulling on the rope. epps watches him for a bit, then looks at the pack of gold and the rest of the equipment. suddenly he scurries about gathering up all the things they've brought down. jaeger continues his climb, disappearing up into the crevice. a few beats later the rope comes snaking back down from, above. epps brings over the pack of gold and attaches it to the rope. yelling up:}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{okay!}
<A>__{the rope goes taught, slowly drawing the pack up, up into the crevice finally to be swallowed from view. epps waits for the rope to come back down. he waits. he waits a beat more. no rope.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{wes? jaeger?}
<A>__{he tries to keep the apprehension from his voice, but it creeps in anyway. he tries it again.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{jaeger?}
<A>__{still more nothing. what's that sound? it's epps' breath getting heavier and faster.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{jaeger!?}
<A>__{nothing. then something. the rope snakes its way back down. epps can't help but let go of a little laugh, like a guy who's just been given a scare by his own shadow. taking up his own pack epps hooks up, then starts the climb to the top.}
