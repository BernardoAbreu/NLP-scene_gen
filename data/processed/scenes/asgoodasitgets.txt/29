<L>__{interior hospital room day}
<A>__{as jackie enters.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{how you doing, great one?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i haven't looked at myself yet. i figured i could tell from your reaction.}
<A>__{he turns toward her. much of his body taped his painting hand wrapped. simon's face is something of a horror. swollen, one savage discolored cut. we are into yuccchhh... the sight is a jolt. jackie breaks into tears... sobs, actually.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{that bad, huh?}
<A>__{they share a helpless half laugh then frank appears in the doorway.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{hey, hey...}
<P>__{(as he sees him)}
<D>__{haaa... bad but temporary. the nurses say it's much better than you looked three weeks ago... the hand will come back... they're sure...}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{jackie, will you hand me the mirror?}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(a small voice)}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{she starts to hand him a large mirror from her purse then thinks better of it.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{wait, i have a smaller one.}
<A>__{but he holds out his hand and she gives him the mirror he starts to look then thinks better of it.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{so, what's new anyway? how's verdell?}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(sheepish)}
<D>__{your neighbor udall is taking care of him.}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(suddenly alive and upset)}
<D>__{how could you do that? he'll hurt him.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no, i promise... not a chance. i own this guy. there was no one else. i'm on the move too much. trust me.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{you are very certain my dog is okay... because you have no idea...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yes. your dog is fine, simon.}
<A>__{simon holds the mirror poised for a moment of discovery, then he takes a breath like someone about to dive underwater. first a small, mumbled pep talk to himself.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{okay, waiting gives the devil time. now!}
<A>__{he quickly brings his hand up and looks at the mirror... he is startled the bottom drops out leaving him awed by his misfortune.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{oh my... where'd i go? ummmm?}
