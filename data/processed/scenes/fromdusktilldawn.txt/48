<L>__{interior bathroom mobile home night}
<A>__{the bathroom, which consists of a shower, a toilet and a small sink, is a tight fit with three people in it. richard has his back against the wall, with his arm around kate, holding her in front of him. one hand is over her mouth, the other holds a .45 against her head. kate's eyes are wide with fear. seth stands, .45 in hand, ready to fire if the wrong person should open the door. everybody talks low and quiet.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{this isn't gonna work.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{shut up. it's gonna work just fine,}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{i just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{duly noted. now, shut up.}
<A>__{everyone's quiet for a second, till richard breaks it.}
<C>__{richard}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{they're gonna search the van.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(offhand)}
<D>__{as long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(distracted)}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{richard lets kate go, she quickly moves to the side.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{you just called me a fuckin' nut.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{no, i didn't.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{yes, you did. you said as long as i don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that i've been acting like a fuckin' nut.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{take a pill, kid. i just meant stay cool.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{you meant that, but you meant the other, too.}
<A>__{kate can't believe what she's watching. neither can seth.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(serious as a heart attack)}
<D>__{this ain't the time, richard.}
<C>__{richard}
<P>__{(his voice rising)}
<D>__{fuck those spic pigs! you called me a fuckin' nut, and where i come from, that stops the train on its tracks.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(real quiet and violent)}
<D>__{keep your voice down.}
<C>__{richard}
<P>__{(quiet back)}
<D>__{or what?}
<B>__{back to jacob and scott}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{have you forgotten about your sister?}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{they're gonna kill us. they get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{if they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{dad, i watch those reality shows. they never let anybody go. any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. this is our chance.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what about kate?}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{they're gonna kill her anyway. at least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{son, i have this situation under control. i know exactly what i'm doing. you're going to have to trust me on this.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{if trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, i can't do that. if you don't tell the cops, i will.}
<A>__{jacob grabs scott by the front of his shirt, and yanks him to him.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{now, you listen to me. you ain't gonna do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear me! nobody cares what you think, i'm running this show, i make the decisions.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{he's running the show.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i'm running the show. i make the plays, and you back the plays i make. stop thinking with your fucking balls. kate in a room with a couple of desperate men with nothing to fucking lose ain't the time to "go for it." i need your cover. cover my ass.}
<A>__{there's a honk behind them. they both look out the window. it's their turn with the border patrol guards. jacob takes the wheel and drives up. a stern border guard approaches jacob's window.}
<C>__{border guard}
<D>__{how many with you?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{just my son and i.}
<C>__{border guard}
<D>__{what is your purpose in mexico?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{vacation. i'm taking him to see his first bullfight.}
<B>__{back to bathroom}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{i'm curious. what was the nuttiest thing i did?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{this ain't the time.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{oh, i know, was it possibly when your ass was rotting in jail and i broke it out? yeah, you're right, that was pretty fuckin' nutty. not to mention stupid. but you know what? i can fix that right now.}
<A>__{seth hauls off and punches richard smack in the head. richard hits the floor, guard, jacob, and scott hear richard fall in the bathroom.}
<C>__{border guard}
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.}
<C>__{border guard}
<D>__{you said it was just you and your son.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i meant me, my son and my daughter.}
<A>__{close up border guard}
<C>__{border guard}
<D>__{open the door. i'm coming aboard.}
<B>__{back to bathroom}
<A>__{close up kate we can only see kate's face. it's scared. we hear rustling around the bathroom, but we don't know what it is. then it's quiet. then we hear talking outside the door, but we can't make it out. then we hear a knock.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i'm in the bathroom.}
<C>__{border guard }
<D>__{it's the border patrol. open up.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{it's open.}
<A>__{we hear the door open and see the light change on kate's face. she's looking up. border guard in the doorway looking in. he sees: kate by herself, pants around her ankles, sitting on the toilet.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{do you mind? shut the fucking door.}
<C>__{border guard}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{he closes the door. kate lets out a breath. we wait a beat, seth pulls back the curtain in the shower, we see richie on the floor of the shower knocked out. seth and kate meet eyes. he gives her the o.k. signal.}
