<L>__{exterior rue de la chanvrerie end of day}
<A>__{marius is stopped as he exits the front door of the gorbeau tenement by a passing carriage. once it passes marius sees two people in the street outside. one is an old gentleman, valjean. the other is a beautiful young girl, cosette. the two are giving alms to beggars as they walk back from evening church service. marius can't take his eyes off cosette. he's never seen anyone so lovely in his life. we hear the instrumental foreshadowing of `a heart full of love'. as if drawn by marius's gaze, cosette looks up and meets his eyes. she too is amazed: he's looking at her as if he already knows her. a second carriage breaks their held gaze. marius continues on down the street and when he looks back, at that precise moment cosette looks at him again. valjean instinctively puts his arm round her, guarding her jealously from this distant boy's gaze. we cut further down the street to an alleyway where the thenardiers, heavily disguised, are waiting for valjean's approach with their gang of crooks, babet, brujon, clacquesous, montparnasse.}
<C>__{thenardier}
<D>__{everyone here, you know your place brujon, babet, clacquesous you, montparnasse, watch for the law with eponine take care.}
<P>__{(montparnasse hurries over}
<D>__{to the doorway where eponine was watching}
<P>__{marius)}
<D>__{you turn on the tears!}
<P>__{(to madame thenardier who is holding a baby)}
<D>__{no mistakes, my dears!}
<A>__{thenardier approaches valjean and lures him into the mouth of the alleyway where madame thenardier is sat on the ground holding the crying infant. cosette is a few steps behind, still entranced by the sight of marius.}
<C>__{thenardier}
<D>__{please, m'sieur, come this way. here's a child that ain't eaten today. save a life, spare a sou! god rewards all the good that you do.}
<A>__{as valjean bends down to look at madame thenardier she recognizes him.}
<C>__{madame thenardier}
<D>__{wait a bit! know that face!}
<P>__{(to monsieur thenardier)}
<D>__{ain't the world a remarkable place!}
<C>__{thenardier}
<D>__{men like me don't forget you're the bastard who borrowed cosette!}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{what is this? are you mad? no, monsieur, you don't know what you say!}
<A>__{thenardier pulls off his disguise. valjean recognises him.}
<C>__{thenardier}
<D>__{you know me! i know you! and you'll pay what i'm due.}
<A>__{he signals to his gang. a door opens in the alleyway revealing the huge brujon. the gang move in on valjean menacingly.}
<C>__{eponine}
<P>__{(shouts from up the street)}
<D>__{it's the police! disappear! run for it! it's javert!}
<A>__{the gang spill out into the street to find themselves confronted by javert now with his men. marius watches, as does gavroche, drawn by the rumpus.}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{another brawl in the square! another stink in the air! was there a witness to this? well, let him speak to javert!}
<A>__{he sees man with his arm protectively round a girl but does not recognize valjean as valjean has averted his face.}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{monsieur, these streets are not safe. but let these vermin beware, we'll see that justice is done!}
<A>__{he turns back on the thenardier gang in the passage.}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{look upon this fine collection crawled from underneath a stone. this swarm of worms and maggots could have picked you to the bone! i know this man over here, i know his name and his trade. and on your witness, m'sieur, i will see him suitably paid.}
<A>__{he turns back to find valjean and cosette gone.}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{but where's the gentlemen gone? and why on earth did he run?}
<C>__{thenardier}
<D>__{you will have a job to find him! he's not all he seems to be and that girl he trails behind him she's the child he stole from me!}
<A>__{marius, equally baffled, goes off in search of them.}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{could it be he's that old jailbird that the tide now washes in? heard my name and started running... all the omens point to him.}
<A>__{thenardier, listening, hears this all with great interest. so valjean is a crook like him.}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{and the girl who stood beside him, when i turned they both had gone. could he be the man i've hunted? could it be he's jean valjean?}
<C>__{thenardier}
<D>__{in the absence of a victim, dear inspector, may i go? and remember when you've nicked him it was me what told you so.}
<C>__{javert}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{let the old man keep on running i will run him off his feet!}
<P>__{(to the crowd)}
<D>__{everyone about your business!}
<P>__{(to gavroche)}
<D>__{clear this garbage off the street!}
<A>__{gavroche is sitting on a horse trough and falls back into it when javert surprises him. he is furious. he sings to javert's departing back, and to marius who is close by.}
<C>__{gavroche}
<D>__{that inspector thinks he's something but it's me who runs this town! and my theatre never closes and the curtain's never down! trust gavroche! have no fear! you can always find me here!}
<C>__{eponine}
<D>__{cosette! now i remember... cosette! how can it be? we were children together. look what's become of me.}
<A>__{she turns back to find marius gazing down the street.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{eponine! who was that girl?}
<C>__{eponine}
<D>__{that bourgeois two a penny thing!}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{eponine, find her for me!}
<C>__{eponine}
<D>__{what will you give me?}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{anything!}
<C>__{eponine}
<D>__{got you all excited now, but god knows what you see in her. aren't you all delighted now? no, i don't want your money, sir.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{eponine, do this for me, discover where she lives. but careful how you go don't let your father know. eponine! i'm lost until she's found.}
<C>__{eponine}
<D>__{you see? i told you so! there's lots of things i know! eponine, she knows her way around.}
