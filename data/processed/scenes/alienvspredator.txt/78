<A>__{connors makes his way through a maze of pitch black ducts. he too has been released from his stone cell. he carries a flashlight in one hand, an ice axe in the other. every fifty feet the duct splits in two. a bewildering array of possibilities. connors drops his flashlight. he reaches down to get it and finds it covered in slimy alien residue. puzzlement turns to fear on connors' face. connors hears miller and verheiden's faint voice.}

<C>__{connors}
<D>__{it's connors. where are you?}
<A>__{connors is petrified. he raises the ice axe, ready to strike. as connors rounds a corner, his flashlight illuminates something horrific! it's standing right in front of him but we can't see it! connors' face is throttled with shock.}
