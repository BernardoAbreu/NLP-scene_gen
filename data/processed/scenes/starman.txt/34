<A>__{the star man, still in his life support suit, looks surreal in the twilight world under the canopy of firs. the morning rain has gone. a hum of traffic pulls him across the hill to a stand of alders that border the forest. through the leaves he can see a highway entering the sprawl of eau claire, wisconsin. the cars and trucks zipping along the asphalt are of particular interest to him. when he has absorbed them he walks through the trees to get a better look at the town. on the wind he can hear shouts from students boarding a line of yellow buses in front of a grade school off to his right. suburban houses have begun to snuggle up to the base of the hill he is on. keeping to the tree line well above them he continues his search for an avenue of escape. his head swivels to watch a volvo station wagon come down the street. it swings into the driveway of the house directly below him and stops next to a mustang hatchback. the back door opens and jenny haydn, a pretty girl in her mid twenties, gets out carrying a crudely lettered be ribboned sign 'welcome back, mrs. haydn.' female voices drift up to the star man from inside the car.}
