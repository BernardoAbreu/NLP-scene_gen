<L>__{interior wishbone lab, carrier night}
<A>__{banner and stark are working on tracking the cube. banner is scanning the scepter with a device.}
<C>__{banner}
<D>__{the gamma readings are definitely consistent with selvig’s reports on the tesseract. but it’s gonna take weeks to process.}
<A>__{stark works on a screen.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{if we bypass their mainframe and direct route to the homer cluster we can clock this at around six hundred teraflops.}
<C>__{banner}
<D>__{all i packed was a toothbrush.}
<C>__{tony}
<P>__{(giggles a bit)}
<D>__{you know, you should come by stark tower some time. top ten floors all r and d. you’d love it, it’s a candy land.}
<C>__{banner}
<D>__{thanks but...last time i was in new york i kind of broke...harlem.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{well, i promise a stress free environment. no tension, no surprises.}
<A>__{he zaps banner in the side.}
<C>__{banner}
<D>__{ow!}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{hey!}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{nothing?}
<A>__{steve approaches.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{are you nuts?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{jury’s out!}
<P>__{(to banner)}
<D>__{you really have got a lid on it, haven’t you? what’s your secret? mellow jazz, bongo drums, huge bag of weed?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{is everything a joke to you?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{funny things are.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn’t funny. no offense, doc.}
<C>__{banner}
<D>__{no it’s alright. i wouldn’t have come aboard if i couldn’t handle pointy things.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{you’re tip toeing, big man. you need to strut.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{and you need to focus on the problem, mister stark.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{you think i’m not? why did fury call us in? why now, why not before? what isn’t he telling us? i can’t do the equation unless i have all the variables.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you think fury’s hiding something?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{he’s a spy. captain, he’s the spy. his secrets have secrets.}
<A>__{he gestures to banner.}
<D>__{it’s bugging him to, isn’t it?}
<C>__{banner}
<D>__{uh, aah, i just wanna finish my work here and }
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{doctor?}
<C>__{banner}
<D>__{a warm light for all mankind," loki’s jab at fury about the cube.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i heard it.}
<C>__{banner}
<D>__{well, i think that was meant for you.}
<A>__{he gestures to stark, who offers him a blueberry.}
<D>__{even if barton didn’t tell loki about the tower, it was still all over the news.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{the stark tower? that big ugly }
<A>__{stark gives him a look.}
<D>__{ building in new york?}
<C>__{banner}
<D>__{it’s powered by an arc reactor, self sustaining energy source. that building will run itself for, what, a year?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{it’s just the prototype.}
<P>__{(to rodgers)}
<D>__{i’m kind of the only name in clean energy right now, that’s what he’s getting at.}
<C>__{banner}
<D>__{so, why didn’t shield bring him in on the tesseract project? what are they even doing in the energy business in the first place?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{i should probably look into that as soon as my decryption program finishes breaking into all of shield’s secure files.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i’m sorry did you say }
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{jarvis has been running it since i hit the bridge. in a few hours i’ll know every dirty secret shield has ever tried to hide. blueberry?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{yet you’re confused about why they didn’t want you around.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{an intelligence organization that fears intelligence? historically, not awesome.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i think loki’s trying to wind us up. this is a man who means to start a war and if we don’t stay focused he’ll succeed. we have orders, we should follow them.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{following’s not really my style.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{and you’re all about style, aren’t you?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{out of the people in this room, which one is "a" wearing a spangly outfit and "b" not of use?}
<C>__{banner}
<D>__{steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{just find the cube.}
<A>__{cap exits the lab, pauses and turns, walking off in another direction.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{that’s the guy my dad never shut up about? wondering if they shouldn’t have kept him on ice.}
<C>__{banner}
<D>__{guy’s not wrong about loki, he does have the jump on us.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{what he’s got is an acme dynamite kit. it’s gonna blow up in his face, and i’m gonna be there when it does.}
<C>__{banner}
<D>__{i’ll read all about it.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{mhm, or, you’ll be suiting up with the rest of us.}
<C>__{banner}
<D>__{now, you see i don’t get a suit of armor. i’m exposed, like a nerve, it’s a nightmare.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{you know, i’ve got a cluster shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart. this stops it }
<A>__{he taps the arc reactor.}
<D>__{ this little circle of light. it’s part of me now, not just armor. it’s a terrible privilege.}
<C>__{banner}
<D>__{but you can control it.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{because i learned how.}
<C>__{banner}
<D>__{it’s different.}
<A>__{tony wipes clean the screen between them that banner was working on.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{hey, i read all about your accident. that much gamma exposure should’ve killed you.}
<C>__{banner}
<D>__{so you’re saying that the hulk the other guy saved my life? that’s nice. that’s nice sentiment. saved it for what?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{i guess we’ll find out.}
<C>__{banner}
<D>__{you may not enjoy that.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{and you just might.}
