<L>__{interior st. luc's examination room night}
<A>__{st. luc is examining mr. parkins. parkins sits on the examination table with the hospital tunic on. st. luc presses gently around parkins' abdomen in the area of the navel.}
<C>__{parkins}
<D>__{ow! better take it easy. there's a lot of pressure in there!}
<A>__{st. luc stops pressing and takes up his stethoscope. he begins to percuss the old man's abdomen.}
<C>__{parkins}
<D>__{want me to breathe deeply?}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{just breathe normally.}
<A>__{st. luc finishes percussing, removes the stethoscope from his ears, and stands back thoughtfully.}
<C>__{parkins}
<P>__{(confidentially)}
<D>__{good shape for an old man, eh?}
<C>__{st. luc}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{mr. parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?}
<C>__{parkins}
<D>__{she had a couple just like them. right here near her belly button. you could push 'em around. i thought they were kinda sexy, myself.}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?}
<C>__{parkins}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{didn't seem worried about them.}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{was this girl from starliner towers?}
<C>__{parkins}
<D>__{yep. she lived in 1208. but we usually went to my place. bigger liquor cabinet, bigger bed.}
<P>__{(chuckles, then gets serious)}
<D>__{she was gone when i got back from my last florida trip. too bad. had a beautiful tan.}
<P>__{(smiles again)}
<D>__{must have gone home to mother.}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{was her name annabelle horsefield?}
<C>__{parkins}
<D>__{that's the one.}
<A>__{st. luc sits down at the counter beneath the medicine cabinet and begins to write in parkins' file.}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{ok, you can get dressed now, mr. parkins.}
<A>__{the old man begins to put his shirt and tie back on.}
<C>__{st. luc}
<P>__{(handing parkins a slip of paper)}
<D>__{i'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few x rays taken. i want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, ok? give them this. the address is right there under radiology.}
<C>__{parkins}
<D>__{gonna cut me open?}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{well, let's wait for the x rays.}
<C>__{parkins}
<D>__{used to know a doctor who said he got to know his patients better than their wives did.}
<P>__{(chuckles)}
<D>__{cutting a man open sure does expose more of him than pulling down his pants, gotta admit that.}
<A>__{st. luc smiles politely, his mind obviously elsewhere.}
