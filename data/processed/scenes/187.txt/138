<L>__{exterior rita's trailer (sun valley) same morning}
<A>__{(7:30 am) strictly low rent district. the small dirt yard in front is contained within a cinder block wall. rita, back to her chola look, heavy makeup, black (right) eye where cesar punched her, watches her two younger brothers as they fight over a toy truck. her three year old baby sister, maricella (too big to be carried) straddles her hip as rita yells at the boys...}

<A>__{something stirs deep inside her.}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(struggles with it)}
<D>__{why'd they have to kill snowball?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{... they didn't.}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(on the verge of tears now)}
<D>__{what's it fuckin' matter?! 'at school shit's for other kids, not me!}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{that's not true. you're so smart, rita. don't you know that? you have an opportunity here to change your life. please don't throw away everything we've worked for.}
<A>__{trevor just stares at her, incredulously. rita lowers her gaze, unable to look him in the eye. momentous deliberation, and now...}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{i know what happened with childress.}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(knitting her eyebrows)}
<D>__{what?}
