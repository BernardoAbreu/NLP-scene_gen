<T>__{fade to black:}
<A>__{the sounds of a dinner banquet. forks clanking against plates and the din of a hundred conversations, broken by... the ding, ding, ding of a spoon tapping against a wine glass. super title: "moscow three weeks later}
<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{interior banquet room night}
<A>__{hundreds of men and women in formal evening wear sit at round banquet tables. a hush falls over the guests as the dinging continues. all attention turns to the front table. a rotund, silver haired man in his late sixties rises and sidles past u.s. and russian flags up to the podium microphone. he is stoli petrov, president of russia.}
<C>__{petrov}
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{thank you for joining us this evening.}
<A>__{petrov's harsh russian issues through the room. but over it we hear a young woman's voice translating.}
<C>__{translator }
<D>__{tonight we are honored to have with us a man of remarkable courage, who, despite strong international criticism...}
<A>__{at the front table a translator's words ring in the earpiece of a handsome man in his mid forties. worry lines crease his forehead and the touch of gray at his temples attest to three very difficult years in office. this man is james marshall, and he is the president of the united states of america. he busily makes last minute changes to his speech.}
<C>__{translator}
<P>__{(v.o. earpiece)}
<D>__{has chosen to join our fight against tyranny in forging a new world community. ladies and gentlemen, i give you the president of the united states of america...}
<A>__{mr. president. thunderous applause as marshall rises and approaches the podium. at the back of the room, doherty, a senior policy adviser whispers to the president's chief of staff ed shepherd...}
<C>__{doherty}
<D>__{maybe we should consider running him for re election instead of the u.s.}
<A>__{the applause dies as marshall begins to speak.}
<C>__{marshall}
<P>__{(in russian with subtitles)}
<D>__{good evening and thank you. first i would ask you to join me in a moment of silence for the victims of the turkmenistan massacres.}
<A>__{the room remains silent a few beats. most guests respectfully bow their heads. marshall begins again, but this time in english. the young woman translates simultaneously for the russian audience.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{as you know, three weeks ago american special forces, in cooperation with the russian republican army, secured the arrest of turkmenistan's self proclaimed dictator, general ivan stravanavitch, whose brutal sadistic reign had given new meaning to the word horror. i am proud to say our operation was a success.}
<A>__{applause from the audience. marshall turns the page on his speech.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{and now, yesterday's biggest threat to world peace... today awaits trial for crimes against humanity.}
<A>__{during the applause, marshall pulls a page from the speech, folds it and slides it into his pocket. he removes his glasses and looks out into the crowd. his tone becomes more personal. he's not reciting the speech anymore.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{what we did here was important. we finally pulled our heads out of the sand, we finally stood up to the brutality and said "we've had enough. every time we ignore these atrocities the rapes, the death squads, the genocides every time we negotiate with these, these thugs to keep them out of gig country and away from gig families, every time we do this.e. we legitimize terror.}
<A>__{terror is not a legitimate system of government. and to those who commit the atrocities i say, we will no longer tolerate, we will no longer negotiate, and we will no longer be afraid. it's your turn to be afraid. applause rolls through the crowd.}
