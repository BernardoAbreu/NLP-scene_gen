<A>__{milton and mary ann sitting together. alone.}
<C>__{mary ann}
<D>__{deadbeats. i mean, that's what it comes down to. you can call yourself a finance trainee, or a financial resources adviser, or whatever, you're still spending most of your day trying to hammer car payments out of deadbeats.}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{no deadbeats here tonight.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{you'd be surprised. there's a lot more fear in this room than you'd think.}
<C>__{mary ann}
<D>__{what do these people have to be afraid of?}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{each other. themselves. why? what scares you?}
<C>__{mary ann}
<D>__{not knowing who the deadbeats are.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{you'll figure that out. there's only one thing worth being frightened of anyway, and that's being alone. truly and finally alone.}
<C>__{mary ann}
<D>__{yes. i think you're right.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{you know what terrifies me? responsibility.}
<C>__{mary ann}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{for what. for you. let's be honest, i've changed your life. changed it forever. there's been a seismic shift in your existence and i'm responsible. and you've never even met me. we're talking for the very first time. how insane is that?}
<C>__{mary ann}
<D>__{it's a wonderful opportunity for kevin.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{kevin. please. i'm not worried about kevin. he buys a few new suits. learns a few new tricks. he's there. i don't worry about kevin. what about you?}
<C>__{mary ann}
<D>__{i'm not leaving a lot behind.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{you must have family.}
<C>__{mary ann}
<D>__{bad subject. i haven't spoken to my folks in a long time. my sister ran all the way to germany.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{whoaa... i gotta think about that. i had you down as daddy's little girl, you know? the princess. sugar plum snapshots. pastel bedspreads. cinnamon cookies.}
<C>__{mary ann}
<D>__{i tell kevin the only thing worse than not having a father was having mine.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{so you've got a lot at stake here. you've made a real commitment.}
<C>__{mary ann}
<D>__{i guess i have.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{it's not gonna be like gainesville, but then you know that already.}
<C>__{mary ann}
<D>__{we're gonna be fine. it's gonna be great.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{if it isn't, will you come to me? let me help? i'd feel a lot less responsible. will you do that for me?}
<C>__{mary ann}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{the worst vice is advice, right? but can i make a suggestion? it's about your hair, some people are sensitive, that's why i ask.}
<C>__{mary ann}
<D>__{no. i mean, go ahead. you don't like it?}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{you have shoulders nobody can see. pull it back.}
<C>__{mary ann}
<D>__{you mean, you want me to pull my hair back?}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{if i do it, everyone in this room that's pretending not to watch us will assume we're fucking or something. pull back your hair.}
<P>__{(there's the mirror)}
<D>__{take a look. see. that's it. isn't that incredible? you need to cut your hair.}
<C>__{mary ann}
<D>__{you're kidding.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{a woman's shoulders are the frontlines of her mystique. and her neck, if she's alive, has the very mystery of a border town. it's the no man's land in the battle between mind and body.}
