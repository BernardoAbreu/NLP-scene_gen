<L>__{ext andalusian villa (late night pre dawn)}
<A>__{the stars dimming, the sky a gun metal blue. ethan and nyah emerge from the villa, walking slowly. nyah's clearly preoccupied.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{i'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace. even after i botched the job, i could've walked out of there with the bloody thing.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{at least you walked.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{if you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{wanted to see how good you were. i'm hoping we might work together.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{may i say something, no offence? you look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop what the bloody hell do you have in mind?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{working under adverse conditions. highly adverse conditions.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{sounds smashing. i'm in. muchacho, mi carro, por favor! now be serious. you couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{you didn't do that badly.}
<A>__{her car arrives.}
<C>__{nyah}
<P>__{(as she moves to her car)}
<D>__{you're apologizing for me? quite the gentleman..}
<C>__{ethan}
<P>__{(opening the car door)}
<D>__{not really. i triggered the alarm..}
<A>__{one foot on the floorboard she freezes, back to ethan.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{hey, the bulgari job last week was flawless. and i've always been partial to pale yellows.}
<A>__{she slides behind the wheel.}
<C>__{nyah}
<P>__{(as he leads on the car)}
<D>__{i don't do laundry, or put up with cheeky bastards who set me up on their territory so they can poach on mine.}
<A>__{she takes off, spewing bits of gravel and dust in her wake. ethan smiles and shakes his head. on the road nyah (moving) around curves, hair flying, she's free. her car phone rings. perplexed, she lets it ring once or twice picks it up:}
<C>__{nyah}
<P>__{(tentatively)}
<D>__{hola..}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{hi. would you mind slowing down?}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{where did you get this number? i don't even have it!}
<C>__{ethan' voice}
<D>__{would you like it?}
<A>__{she hits the end button and disconnects. the phone immediately rings again. she refuses to pick up. ethan pulls alongside hers. she looks at him. they speak through the open cars.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{pull over and listen to me, will you? just listen..}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{listen to what?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{i need your help and i thin you can use mine.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{your help? what are you talking about?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{scotland yard, interpol, every dutch authority. i can make them go away.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{oh bloody hell. you're a spy.}
<A>__{she floors it and shoots ahead of ethan, nicking his car as she takes off.}
<C>__{ethan}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{i deserved that.}
<A>__{series of driving shots nyah and ethan ethan rings her again. and keeps ringing. her face becomes grim, her flight progressively more desperate and with ethan's pursuit progressively more determined. they are reaching the limits of adhesion around blind curves. more shots driving (dawn) the sky's battleship gray; ethan pursues nyah around hairpin turns high above the costa del sol; they rip thru patches of marine fog drifting on the road, obscuring it. both are appalled by the other's willingness to escalate risk in this game of flight and pursuit until ethan tears thru a fogbank and sees on his gps what nyah can't see thru the fog less than four hundred meters ahead is a turn she can't possibly negotiate and if she can't she'll plunge off the road hundreds of feet to rock and sea below. ringing her number again:}
<C>__{ethan}
<P>__{(half to himself)}
<D>__{slow down, slow down.}
<A>__{she turns up a mound and loses control. she spins out and heads toward the edge of the cliff.}
<C>__{nyah}
<P>__{(realizing she's in trouble)}
<D>__{uh oh.}
<A>__{ethan cuts her off and sends them both into a 540 degree spin. her car stops just at the cliff's edge. furious she wrenches open the car door and gets out.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{suddenly there's no nyah. ethan leaps over to nyah's car and sees nyah dangling over the ocean and rocks hundreds of feet below, holding the door handle.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{oh..oh..}
<A>__{taking a firm grip on her wrist.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{don't look down. just..look at me. that's it..that's it..}
<A>__{he pulls nyah up to the car, across the seat and half into his arms. for a long moment it looks like she's in shock. then:}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{what's you name?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{ethan hunt.}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{well, ethan hunt, what is it you want to talk to me about?}
<A>__{thru the veil of morning fog, nyah looks at ethan. her dark eyes suggest wit, and willingness, and longing.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{...more than i thought..}
<A>__{they scarcely to move to bring their lips together:}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{awfully short notice..}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{care to wait a decent interval?}
<C>__{nyah}
<D>__{who wants to be decent?..}
