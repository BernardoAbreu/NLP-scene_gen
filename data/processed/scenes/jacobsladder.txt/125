<L>__{interior off campus coffee shop day}
<A>__{jacob and professor stern are sitting at a quiet table in a nearly empty coffee shop. they are both fixing cups of tea, not speaking. suddenly jacob looks at stern.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i've got a problem, prof. more augus tine than kierkegaard, if you know what i mean.}
<P>__{(stern looks at him questioningly)}
<D>__{i need to know about ... demons.}
<C>__{stern}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{demons, jacob? why demons? are you writing ... ?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(he pauses a moment)}
<D>__{i see them.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{see them?}
<P>__{(he smiles uncomforta bly)}
<D>__{what do you mean? physically?}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(hesitantly)}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{stern pauses. he looks at jacob. the intensity of his gaze is unsettling and jacob reaches for his tea. the cup rattles.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{i know very little about demons, ja cob, fleshy ones anyway. i know them as literary figures, biblical ones ... dante, milton ... but jacob,}
<P>__{(he pauses)}
<D>__{this is the 20th century. we don't see demons now.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i see them, prof. everywhere. they're invading my life.}
<A>__{a look of concern fills stern's eyes.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{christ, i know how it sounds.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{have you considered a doctor? a psy chiatrist?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(suddenly uneasy)}
<D>__{i don't want them. i'm not looking for analysis or drugs. it's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.}
<P>__{(he pauses uncomforta bly)}
<D>__{it's more than that. i can feel it. i need you prof. you're the only one i can talk to.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{i don't know what to say.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i need your insight, your intuition.}
<A>__{stern sips his tea slowly. he is thinking.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{demons? i don't know what to tell you. it sounds like a spiritual mat ter to me. the problem, jacob, is that you have no context for it. you're a renegade existentialist suf fering demons a hundred years after freud. how the hell am i supposed to make it fit?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i'm afraid, prof. nothing makes sense.}
<P>__{(he pauses)}
<D>__{please help me.}
<C>__{stern}
<P>__{(trying to be delicate)}
<D>__{jacob, i don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. i don't be lieve in devils fighting for our souls. i don't believe in enternal damnation. i don't believe in other worldly creatures tormenting us. we don't need them. we do a good enough job on ourselves.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(disturbed)}
<D>__{but i see them.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{look. i don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. for all i know it's pathological and they should be pumping valium into your veins by the quart. but if you're not willing to accept the help of sci ence; and believe me, i admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat tle on your own. what can i say? it's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. but to be pursued by ... demons no less ... there are no guides, jacob.}
<P>__{(he muses)}
<D>__{you wanna know what i'd do if i sud denly started seeing demons? i'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. i'm no sainterior}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{hell, you think i am?}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{i'venever understood you, you know that? you were by far the best pupil i've ever had, bar none. intellectu ally, you were the most original, the most imaginative. who knows, maybe you've been "elected" to see demons. maybe you're in touch with ... some thing. nothing would surprise me about you jacob. nothing.}
<A>__{jacob gazes at his old friend and mentor, frustration blazing in his eyes. they are both surprised to see tears form and run down his cheek. jacob reaches for a napkin and dries them quickly. stern, uncomfortable in the face of emotion, turns away. addendum 2: the party at della's suddenly a strange and terrifying spectacle unfolds before him. the dancers undergo a shocking transformation, a full three dimensional alteration of their physical forms. clothes fuse to their bodies like new skin. horns and tails emerge and grow like exotic genitalia, exciting a frenzy among the dancers. new appendages appear unfolding from their flesh. dorsal fins protrude from their backs. armored scales run in scallops down their legs. tails entwine sensuously. long tongues lick at the undersides of reptilian bellies. the metamorphosis holds a biological fascination. bones and flesh mold into new forms of life, creatures of another world.}
