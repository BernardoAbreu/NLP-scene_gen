<L>__{exterior yard behind shuttered building night}
<A>__{the yard is grown over. as nick goes in there comes a low buzz of flies. he trips over something, draws back. seeing a candle on the little table under the grape arbor, he crosses and lights it. the yard is full of discarded champagne bottles, red velvet cushions and rotting corpses. nick leans over one of the corpses. the skin is falling away and the eye sockets writhe with maggots. nick straightens, looks around.}
