<L>__{exterior promontory point close on golden spike day}
<A>__{it's driven finally into place to a rousing cheer. pull back to reveal that president grant, his sleeves rolled up, has delivered the blow. hats in the air, handshakes, pictures. the specter of loveless and his evil plot a fading memory. grant turns to west and gordon.}
<C>__{president grant}
<D>__{gentlemen, i now strongly believe the united states is going to be truly united. not because of this railroad... but because of you.}
<A>__{grant scans the crowd, every race seems present at this momentous event. he reaches into his pocket, takes out two silver shields.}
<C>__{president grant}
<D>__{i've signed into law the creation of an agency whose sole duty is to protect the president and the country from lunatics like loveless.}
<P>__{(pins badges on their vests)}
<D>__{welcome to the secret service, agents no. 1 and no. 2.}
<A>__{the president shakes both their hands. gordon resists looking down.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{uh, just out of curiosity, sir... who's agent no. 1?}
<A>__{grant just shakes his head, some things never change.}
<C>__{president grant}
<D>__{i don't think that matters very much, do you? gordon? besides, you'll have plenty of time to discuss it on your new assignment.}
<P>__{(hands them piece of paper)}
<D>__{see you back in washington.}
<A>__{he snaps off a salute, starts to go as they read it. gordon looks up, very troubled.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{but, sir... what about our train?}
<C>__{president grant}
<P>__{(over shoulder)}
<D>__{well, i'm taking it of course. hell, you let loveless blow up mine.}
<A>__{as they look at one another in dismay...}
<C>__{rita }
<D>__{jim... arte...?}
<A>__{they turn to see rita approaching them from a crowd of scientists. she's looking extraordinarily fetching in a print dress and parasol. west and gordon sit up like dogs.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{rita! you look great.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{ravishing, a vision.}
<A>__{she hugs west, she hugs gordon. who's it gonna be?}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{i just wanted to thank you for everything you've done for me... before i went back home to texas.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{texas? why're you going back there? why don't you come with me back to washington?}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{or better still, come with me to washington. i could introduce you to people i still know in the theater...}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{she's not really an entertainer, remember?}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(intercedes)}
<D>__{i can't go with either of you.}
<A>__{she looks from one crestfallen suitor to the other.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{it's not that you both don't have your attributes.}
<P>__{(to gordon)}
<D>__{you're so sophisticated and such a wonderful cook.}
<P>__{(to west)}
<D>__{jim, you're good with a gun... and have great legs.}
<P>__{(to both)}
<D>__{and you're both so brave. but... i'm afraid i haven't been completely honest with you.}
<C>__{west and gordon}
<D>__{uh oh...}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{professor escobar's not my father. he's my husband.}
<A>__{she gestures to a handsome goateed latino waiting for her. shaved and cleaned up, he's not the old man we thought.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{rita... why didn't you just tell us that in the first place?}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{well, i was going to... but would you have really brought me along if i said i was married? honestly.}
<A>__{neither west nor gordon knows what to say.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{i didn't think so.}
<A>__{she turns and starts to walk away. stops and smiles.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{at least you still have each other.}
<A>__{as west and gordon look at one another...}
