<L>__{interior hallway to cell area continuous action}
<A>__{she slams the door shut on his fingers and fumbles to slide the deadbolt behind her when the door suddenly smashes open against her, knocking her backwards onto the floor he looms over her. she reaches around for anything to defend herself. nothing there. game over }
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{it wasn't some satanic pact, society didn't make us do it. but i believe given the proper circumstances a person is capable of anything certainly in my line of work you see it day in, day out.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{tell you what, keep the shirt. the bra will do.}
<A>__{miranda stares, helpless. the sheriff gestures for her to begin. like he has all the time in the world. miranda slides up the wall and starts to unclasp her bra under her shirt. petrified }
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{chin up, doctor. you wanted to get to the bottom of this and you did. you followed it all the way through. this is how it ends.}
<A>__{his demeanor and voice are eerily calm, as if in a trance. he takes the bra from her hand and hangs it around her neck, as if helping somebody with their tie. she takes a step back and finds herself pinned against the wall }
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{doug settled down once you two got married. new start and all that. wanted nothing to do with this runaway i'd found, tracy seaver }
<A>__{he squeezes the bra tightly around her throat, choking her. she stares straight into his eyes her whole body simultaneously frozen in place and shaking uncontrollably }
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{or so he claimed. because the truth, doc is people never change. the son of a bitch couldn't resist. i asked him to dump the body and instead he went found some barn to work her out of his system some more. go fucking figure.}
<A>__{and now we pan down to see miranda's left hand ever so slowly reach for his holster...}
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{you can't count on anyone, even friends you've had your whole life.}
<A>__{they're so close together their noses nearly touch. he gazes into her eyes, watching life drain out of her. he applies one final burst of pressure, stretching her skin to the point of no return }
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{the only soul you can ever count on is yourself }
<A>__{blam! a gunshot rings out and half his ear explodes in a gush of blood. he stumbles back, still on his feet, dazed. he looks up at miranda with the gun trained on him. struggling to catch her breath. a faint smile forms on his lips, somehow appreciative of this turn of events.}
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{why, doctor. that was unexpected.}
<A>__{he steps forward, almost playfully. she slowly shakes her head. wraps her fingers tightly around the trigger }
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{you sure about this?}
<A>__{he stares at her. blood flowing from the side of his head. he's now standing directly in front of miranda's open cell, weighing his options at triple speed }
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{you need me alive for your story to stick. be logical now. you know you can't kill me.}
<A>__{he takes exactly half a step forward when miranda drills a bullet through his forehead. sheriff ryan splays backwards and lands with a crash.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{logic is overrated.}
