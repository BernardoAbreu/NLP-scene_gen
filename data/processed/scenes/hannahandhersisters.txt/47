<L>__{interior evan and norma's apartment day}
<A>__{evan, his back to the camera, walks to the front door and opens it to hannah.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(distracted)}
<D>__{hi. how's she doing?}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{i am glad to see you.}
<A>__{hannah takes off her shoulder bag and her coat as her aggravated father walks past her towards the kitchen. he passes a wall with an ornate mirror and some framed photographs.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{she's in the kitchen there. it's the same thing. same thing. she promises, promises.}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{but it's all lies.}
<A>__{through a doorway, norma can be seen sitting on a chair in the kitchen. she wears a robe over a slip and stockings; she's drinking. evan stands in the doorway looking at her; he doesn't go in.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(offscreen, patiently)}
<D>__{don't make it worse, dad.}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{always.}
<A>__{hannah hurriedly passes her father and enters the kitchen; her mother takes a sip of her drink.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{hi, mom. how you doing? here, let me get you some coffee. that's enough of that.}
<P>__{(taking away her mother's drink, to evan)}
<D>__{what triggered it?}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(gesturing, as norma}
<D>__{turns her head and}
<P>__{watches him)}
<D>__{we were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good looking salesman...}
<A>__{norma reacts, turning to her daughter. hannah, however, has her back turned. she is busy taking charge in the kitchen as evan speaks. she takes some pills out of a cupboard and hands them to her mother with a glass of water.}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{...and your mother was throwing herself at him in a disgusting way, and when she found she was too old to seduce him, that he was just embarrassed by her }
<C>__{norma}
<P>__{(angrily interrupting, turning her head)}
<D>__{liar! liar!}
<A>__{the camera moves to evan, who continues to tell his story, ignoring his wife's outburst, as he walks away from the kitchen doorway into the den.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{then at lunch she got drunker and drunker}
<P>__{(shouting over his shoulder)}
<D>__{and finally she became joan collins!}
<A>__{evan walks over to the piano, where several framed family photographs sit in a line on its top. he picks one up as norma speaks offscreen in the kitchen.}
<C>__{norma}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{all my life i've had to put up with insults...}
<A>__{the camera moves back to the kitchen as norma talks. she is still glaring offscreen at the doorway where evan stood moments before. she holds the water glass and the pills.}
<C>__{norma}
<P>__{(continuing, dramatically)}
<D>__{...from this non person, this, th th this haircut that passes for a man.}
<P>__{(turning to look at the offscreen hannah)}
<D>__{he could never support us. it's a good thing we had a talented daughter!}
<A>__{evan is back in the doorway, listening to norma, getting more and more angry. as he makes a retort, he starts to walk back to the den and his piano.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i can only hope that she was mine. with you as her mother}
<P>__{(gesturing, his voice getting louder)}
<D>__{her father could be anybody in actors' equity!}
<C>__{norma}
<D>__{she's talented...so it's not likely she's yours!}
<P>__{(taking a sip of water)}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(walking over to the}
<D>__{doorway to speak to evan, who's already}
<P>__{fuming in the den)}
<D>__{dad, could you just please stay in the other room and let me take care of her?}
<A>__{hannah goes back to norma; she takes the glass of water away.}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(offscreen, choosing to ignore hannah's suggestion)}
<D>__{you never know when she's going to fall off the wagon and humiliate everybody.}
<A>__{hannah, choosing to ignore evan's remark, hands her mother a cup of coffee; she puts her mother's hands on the cup.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{here, mom. drink this.}
<P>__{(leaning against a kitchen counter)}
<D>__{you know, you're awful. you probably were flirting.}
<C>__{norma}
<P>__{(sipping her coffee)}
<D>__{no! i like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because i get the attention. he's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and i've tried to stay young...at heart.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{you promised to stay on the wagon.}
<C>__{norma}
<P>__{(shaking her head)}
<D>__{the sacrifices i've made because of that man.}
<P>__{(inhaling)}
<D>__{he's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his }
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{his his his his mediocrity!}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{okay, stop being so dramatic.}
<C>__{norma}
<P>__{(shouting to the offscreen evan)}
<D>__{he's the one that's made every ingenue in stock!}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{okay, okay.}
<C>__{norma}
<P>__{(touching hannah's arm, gasping)}
<D>__{th th they, they wanted me for a screen test.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(patiently)}
<D>__{yeah, i know, mom.}
<C>__{norma}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{but i, i knew that he'd get up there and he'd flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes. he's all show!}
<P>__{(touching hannah's}
<D>__{arm again, then}
<P>__{touching her chest)}
<D>__{now how can you act when there's nothing inside to come out?!}
<A>__{norma sips her coffee, softly sobbing. hannah, reacting, walks away from the counter and, capping the bottle of pills, puts them back in the cupboard. evan plays the piano offscreen. the camera moves in on hannah's face as she reflects, her voice heard over the screen.}
<C>__{hannah }
<D>__{she was so beautiful at one time, and he was so dashing. both of them just full of promise and hopes that never materialized.}
<A>__{the camera leaves hannah's face as she continues to reflect; it moves to the den, to the row of family photos on the piano: one of a present day evan and norma, others where both norma and evan are young, beautiful, hopeful. the music plays on.}
<C>__{hannah }
<D>__{and the fights and the constant infidelities to prove themselves...and blaming each other. it's s sad. they loved the idea of having us kids, but raising us didn't interest them much. but it's impossible to hold it against them. they didn't know anything else.}
<A>__{the film cuts back to the kitchen. norma stands up; hannah takes her coffee cup and sets it on the counter.}
<C>__{norma}
<D>__{you know, of all of us in the family, you were the one blessed with the true gift.}
<A>__{she puts her arm around hannah's shoulder. mother and daughter walk out of the kitchen.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(holding the hand her}
<D>__{mother had placed on}
<P>__{her shoulder)}
<D>__{ohhh, my true gift is luck, mom.}
<A>__{norma chuckles.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{i just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know? i've always thought lee was the one destined for great things.}
<C>__{norma}
<D>__{yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.}
<P>__{(gesturing and chuckling)}
<D>__{she knows it. she worships you. she wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(looking at her mother)}
<D>__{now, holly's not shy.}
<A>__{they stop at the entrance to the den. evan can be seen playing the piano as they continue their conversation.}
<C>__{norma}
<D>__{no, holly's game for anything. holly takes after me.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{true.}
<C>__{norma}
<P>__{(shaking her head)}
<D>__{i'd have been a great dope addict.}
<A>__{norma chortles. hannah laughs, touching her mother. they walk over to evan at the piano.}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(looking up)}
<D>__{remember this, hannah?}
<A>__{evan plays a few bars of "you are too beautiful" as mother and daughter, their backs to the camera, listen. norma leans over the piano; hannah looks off into the distance, deep in reflection. the piano music continues in the background as the movie cuts to: lee walking along a wharf by the waterfront. the wind blows her hair; she hugs the e.e. cummings book to her chest. she, too, is deep in thought. she stops at the edge of the wharf; the camera continues to move, to a group of wooden pilings nearby, lapped by the water.}
