<L>__{exterior city morgue morning}
<A>__{it's raining hard. mills exits the morgue building with a few art books and a paper cup of coffee. he holds one art book over his head as he dashes through deep puddles in the street.}
<L>__{interior mills' car morning}
<A>__{mills gets in, puts his coffee on the dash and tosses the art books in a box. he closes the door. alone with the sound of the rain. he wipes water off his face, looks at his tired eyes in the rearview mirror. he reaches in the box of books, takes out copies of the canterbury tales and dante's purgatory. he makes a face, opens dante's purgatory: mills turns to a bookmark, rests the book on the steering wheel. he reads. he bites his lip, leaning close to the words. he concentrates, mouths some of the words to himself. he finally closes the book, shaking his head, not understanding anything he's reading. he starts pounding the book against the steering wheel with all his might.}

<A>__{a figure outside the window knocks on the glass. mills rolls it down. a cop in raincoat hands a wet paper bag through.}
<C>__{mills }
<D>__{good work, officer. good work.}
<A>__{the cop leaves as mills quickly rolls the window up and rips the bag open. inside: cliff notes for dante's purgatory and the canterbury tales.}
