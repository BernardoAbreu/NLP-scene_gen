<L>__{exterior la push cliffs dawn}
<A>__{the sun is just beginning to rise, reddening the clouds overhead. bella paces by the cliff's edge, trying to come to grips with this new reality. jacob keeps his distance, trying to control his anger.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{you just have to... stop.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{it's not a life style choice. it's in my dna.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{killing is in your dna?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{man, i thought maybe you wouldn't be such a hypocrite what, i'm not the right kind of monster for you? can't measure up to your bloodsucking friends }
<C>__{bella}
<P>__{(angry as well)}
<D>__{hey, they manage to survive without hurting innocent people.}
<A>__{jacob stops a beat as his anger is replaced by confusion.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{wait innocent? so... you don't care that i morph into a giant dog. just that i... kill people?}
<C>__{bella}
<P>__{(appalled)}
<D>__{"just?" those hikers' lives mean that little to you?}
<A>__{he bursts out laughing.}
<C>__{bella}
<P>__{(repelled, turns to go)}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{bella bella wait...}
<P>__{(he stops her)}
<D>__{we're not killing hikers. we're trying to protect them.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{from what?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{the only thing we do kill: vampires.}
<C>__{bella}
<P>__{(stunned, reels)}
<D>__{vampires? jake, no }
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(steps back, bitter)}
<D>__{don't worry, we can't touch your precious cullens unless they bite someone and violate the treaty }
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{that's not what i you can't fight vampires. they're too dangerous.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{please. we took out that leech with the dreads easy enough.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{you... killed laurent?}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{... he didn't seem like a friend.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{no, god no. but... how?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{it's what we do, why we exist. a few "lucky guys" in the tribe have the gene. if a bloodsucker moves to town, our dna kicks in, we reach the right age and the fever hits }
<C>__{bella}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{"mono."}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i wish. next thing i know, they're telling me, this is your life now. that future you saw for yourself? gone.}
<A>__{desolation fills him. she sees this.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{it's bad, huh?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i just hate feeling... out of control. like maybe sam is right; you shouldn't be around me.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{like you could get rid of me.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you've seen emily.}
<A>__{that lands with her. she nods.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{sam lost it for a split second; em was standing too close he's still messed up about it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i don't want to be that kind of nightmare.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{you're not like that. you save people, right? you saved me from laurent.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{yeah, didn't mind taking him out. his red headed girlfriend will be fun, too.}
<A>__{bella stops, chilled to the bone.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{victoria. she's here?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{we chased her all the way to the border the other night. but she won't stay gone. keeps coming back if we knew what she was after...}
<P>__{(sees bella's face)}
<D>__{... what?}
