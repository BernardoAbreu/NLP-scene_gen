<A>__{a cattle car is coupled to another, the pin dropped into place. on the platform, clerks at folding tables shuffle paper while others mill around with clipboards, calling out names. thousands of prisoners on the platform, some climbing onto strings of slatted cars on opposing tracks. some already in them, most standing in lines, changing lines, the end of one virtually indistinguishable from the beginning of another. paperwork. lists of names. pens in hands checking them off. some bound for brinnlitz, the rest for auschwitz, if they can be properly sorted from one another. a boy is allowed to remain in a line with his father; his mother is taken to another line composed of women and girls. this segregation is the only recognizable process going on; the others, if they exist, are apparent only to the clerks and guards, and maybe not even to them. it is chaos.}
