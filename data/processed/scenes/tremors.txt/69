<L>__{exterior storage shed day}
<A>__{the storage shed where melvin is hiding. it sits in a vacant, weed choked lot. crashing through the weeds, rhonda has almost reached the shed when she is suddenly brought up short and slams face down in a cloud of dust! she can't get up!! something's got her! she's caught in an old rusted barbed wire fence, lying almost flat, hidden in the weeds. some strands have come loose and are curled up like vicious concertina wire. barely has she taken this in when the ground caves in under her! she rolls wildly to one side as hook tentacles snake up, missing her by inches! she keeps rolling crawling scrambling anything to get away from the awful maw but gets her legs hopelessly tangled in the barbed wire. she freezes. the creature feels around where she was. she calms herself, pulling gingerly at the wire, working tensely to free herself but the creature's mouth slams shut on the fence. like a spider sensing something caught in its web, the monster knows it's on to something. its hook tentacles shoot forward to snare three feet of fence, then the creature lunges up and out, swallowing that three feet in a big "gulp" and yanking rhonda violently toward it! she screams, pants ripped, legs slashed and bleeding! gulp! she's dragged even closer.}
