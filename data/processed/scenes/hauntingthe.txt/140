<L>__{interior great hall night}
<A>__{luke and theo drag nell down the stairs into the great hall. marrow brings up the rear. they retreat for the entry as luke puts his jacket over nell's shoulders. marrow stops, looks back up the stairs.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{wait a second! wait!}
<A>__{all there is are the sounds of nell, luke and theo making for the hall to the entry. the house is silent.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{luke goes out. but nell pauses, stopping theo with her. the house is quiet. marrow's hand still outstretched. nell looks around the room. there are heads everywhere, faces: animal heads, humans, gods, all staring from the woodwork, the carpets everything. all turning to her. theo looks around, but can't see what nell is seeing. nell's breath comes faster, disoriented, yet aware...}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{they're all in here. all the ones he killed. they're just children! we have to help them!}
<C>__{theo}
<P>__{(to marrow)}
<D>__{come on! why are we waiting?}
<A>__{even now, marrow can't believe what he just saw, but theo's voice brings him back. he whirls, grabs onto nell, helps theo drag her out.}
