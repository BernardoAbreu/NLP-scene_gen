<A>__{ben's car is being gassed up. it is a huge gas station with dozens of pumps and many neon lights. ben runs to a series of vending machines. he pushes quarters into them, receiving cigarettes, a sandwich, an apple, a cup of coffee. balancing them all carefully, he runs back to the car, climbs in, puts his purchases on top of the dashboard, hands the attendant a bill and drives off.}
