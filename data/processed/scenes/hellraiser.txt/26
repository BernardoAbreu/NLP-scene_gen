<L>__{interior hallway day}
<A>__{the three sweating men have the bed wedged in the door.}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(not seeing julia)}
<D>__{alright, let's give it another try. 2nd man}
<P>__{(sees julia)}
<D>__{do you really need this bed, lady?}
<A>__{larry turns. sees julia.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{how are you doing through there?}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{it looks like a bomb's dropped. 2nd man got any beer?}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{there's some in the 'fridge.}
<A>__{nobody moves to get it. certainly julia has no intention of being waitress. she goes to the bottom of the stairs.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i will get it.}
<A>__{larry disappears through into the kitchen. julia starts up the stairs, watched appreciatively by the two men in the doorway. one leans over and whispers to the other, who laughs. julia glances back at them. the whisperer licks his lips; the meaning of the gesture perfectly apparent. julia heads upstairs.}
