<A>__{the ship accelerates, and then, with an eye filled burst, whips ahead to warp speed, disappearing.}
<L>__{interior spock's quarters}
<A>__{spock is at meditation as kirk enters quietly. spock looks up.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{we've got a problem.}
<A>__{spock raises an eyebrow }
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{something may be wrong at regula i. we've been ordered to investigate.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{regula i is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i told starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. spock: those cadets of yours how good are they? how will they respond under real pressure?}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{like all living beings, admiral each according to his gifts. the ship is yours.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{that won't be necessary: just take me to regula i.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{excuse my presumption, but i do not agree. as a teacher on a training mission, i am content to command a starship. if we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{but it may be nothing; garbled communications. why don't you...}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{you proceed from a false assumption. i am a vulcan. i have no ego to bruise.}
<A>__{kirk smiles in bemused wonderment.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{you are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{i was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{your mistake, if i may be so bold, was promotion. commanding a starship is your first best destiny. anything else is a waste of material.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i would not presume to debate you.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{that is wise. in any case, were i to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{or the one.}
<A>__{spock inclines his head.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{you are my superior officer. you are also my friend. i have been and always shall be yours.}
<A>__{kirk is moved. he starts to speak, can't finally:}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{will you accompany me to the bridge?}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{i'd best talk with mr. scott, first so that he may, in his own words, explain the situation to his cadets.}
<A>__{kirk's face tells us the wisdom of spock's choice.}
