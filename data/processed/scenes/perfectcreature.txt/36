<A>__{it has rained. the small square is dimly lit. at it's center is a small park with distorted trees. and a rundown playground. a rusty swing creaks. we see a figure there. it is lilly. she watches the rusty swing creak. then she looks up to the surrounding buildings. we tilt up to one of the buildings which is perhaps eight stories high; like the others around the square it is an apartment building. there is movement at the very top. cut to}
