<L>__{exterior snow camp morning}
<A>__{bodies writhe under the fallen mass of canvas, and ra ziel hovers and screeches above. then, a silver blade slits through the tent, and out jumps madmartigan wielding sorsha's sword. alarm! nockmaar soldiers and death dogs charge across the snow. madmartigan battles them with incredible skill, backing toward the mountain slope. wilow crawls out from under the corner of the tent, clutchign the baby. madmartigan kills several so diers, littering the snow with bodies and weapons. willow reacts, impressed by madmartigan's swordsman ship. madmartigan makes the mistake of acknowledging it: he bows, prod and cocky.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{whoops!}
<A>__{he slips on the ice and catches himself. nearby a shield skids off along the snow.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{willow! jump on the shiled!}
<A>__{kael howls and thrashes inside the collapsed tent. then he gashes it open with his huge black sword. he sees willow and the baby get on the large shield.}
<C>__{kael}
<D>__{bowmen! horses! after them!}
<A>__{madmartigan runs toward the shield. archers draw their bows. madmartigan turns and sees sorsha beside kael.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{sorsha! i didn't betray you. i love you!}
<A>__{as arrows rain down around him, madmartigan leaps onto the shield behind wuillow. sorsha watches them as they slide away down the mountain, raziel flapping and shrieking overhead.}
<C>__{kael}
<D>__{kill them!!}
<A>__{kael waves his sward and a crack squad of nockmaar horsemen gallop down the mountain after the sled shield.}
