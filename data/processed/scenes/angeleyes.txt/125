<L>__{interior pogue home day}
<A>__{we're in the midst of the party. we see sharon drifting a bit, a hello here and there. she feels out of place. though the home and yard are thick with people, there is some tension, especially in the core group all who know about the estrangement of sharon. now and then a nervous glance from her mother is directed at sharon, or a hostile glance from larry. sharon passes the videographer, who is pointing light, camera and microphone at the vanders having them put their good wishes on tape. she smiles, then looks over and sees her father across the room. he is alone. she steels herself and heads his way. he makes eye contact, then averts his look. she is approaching him, about to speak, when he walks up to some friends and starts joking with them, leaving sharon hurt, humiliated. her mother has seen this and comes to her, speaking quietly, nervously.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{don't make him talk about... anything today.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{mom, i was going to fix his tie. his tie is crooked.}
<A>__{she sighs, pushing through her hurt to say...}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{it was a nice ceremony.}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{yes. we're running out of chicken, though. nobody's eating the ham.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{it's a great party, mom. you look happy.}
<A>__{some joy is allowed to surface in her mother's face.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{thirty five years and still in love, huh?}
<A>__{her mother's look clouds a little, nervous again.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{you think that's wrong, don't you?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{of course not...}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{i always... i feel like apologizing to you. but i love him.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{and then i feel like apologizing to him for loving you. i'm the one in the middle. i'm the only one in this family who knows how to forgive anybody.}
<A>__{and she walks away. sharon's eyes follow her, surprised and thoughtful. she watches her mother approach her father and straighten his crooked tie. then kathy is moving toward sharon. sharon turns to her and they both speak quietly at the same time.}
<C>__{both}
<D>__{you look great.}
<A>__{then they smile sad smiles. kathy gestures to her face, the faded bruise.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{tons of makeup. on larry, too.}
<A>__{they smile wryly again.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{sorry about that, but... i couldn't stand him doing that to you. i took it on...}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{don't worry. i'm not your mother. if he tries it again, i'm gone. i'm out of there, me and larry junior. he knows that.}
<A>__{they stare, and sharon gives her a hug, kathy returns it.}
<B>__{on larry}
<A>__{we see larry, across the room, notice this hug. he keeps his expression intact for the group he's in, but we see a flare of anger in his eyes.}
<B>__{on sharon}
<A>__{moving across the living room. she sees larry jr. sitting alone and goes to him, sits beside the child who looks sad.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{what's up with you?}
<C>__{larry jr.}
<D>__{they won't let me watch t.v.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{oh. well... let's pretend this is t.v. it's a show about a party.}
<A>__{they look about the room.}
<C>__{sharon}
<P>__{(as if it's a secret)}
<D>__{that man... is really a super hero.}
<C>__{larry jr.}
<D>__{is not.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{is too. and so is she. look. see? red tights under her dress... oh oh, that man gave her a drink with something in it.}
<C>__{larry jr.}
<D>__{with what?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{with stuff to make her sleep. he's a bad guy.}
<A>__{the woman sips her drink, and the boy smiles, getting into it.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{she drank it.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{watch. she'll fall down any minute.}
<A>__{the boy is suddenly swooped up, lifted away by his father. larry puts the boy down near the door.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{hey, sport, you should go play outside.}
<A>__{he turns to sharon.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{stay away from my family.}
<A>__{then he turns to the crowd, smiling a smile without humor, speaking loudly.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{hey, everybody, keep it down. somebody might call the police.}
<A>__{there is some nervous laughter, people watching them now. sharon is angry and embarrassed, keeping her voice low.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{what're you doing?}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(to crowd)}
<D>__{once the cops leave, we can really party.}
<A>__{the crowd around them is all staring now as he turns back to sharon.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{why don't you give everybody a break and go home?}
<A>__{in the hushed tension that follows, a glass falls and shatters, and more people quiet down and stare. sharon looks at her glaring brother, looks at her mother nervously picking up the broken glass no support there. angry and shaken, she turns to the door. she walks to the door, opens it, starts to leave, starts to close the door behind her, and she stops, take takes a breath, battling hard against the old patterns of hurt and anger. she looks at that nearly closed door. she pushes it open and walks back in. we see a surprised and angry look from larry, a worried look from her mother but sharon is moving through the crowd, searching until she sees her father. she heads toward him. he sees her and walks into the kitchen, avoiding her. she follows him. we see larry and his mother exchange an anxious look and then move toward the kitchen.}
