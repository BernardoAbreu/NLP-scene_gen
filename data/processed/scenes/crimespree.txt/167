<A>__{the door flies open as the crew runs across the lot. sami has already started the impala and is waiting for them. a moment later the stairwell door opens and the wiseguys run out, guns blazing. the crew heads for the impala, shooting behind them as they run. nicky "the rake"" shoots. zero is hit in the leg. he falls to the ground, then rolls on his side behind a parked car. he fights through the pain, props himself up and begins to shoot back. two wiseguys step out to flank zero. zero takes aim and shoots one. he lines up on the other wiseguy and pulls the trigger again. click! his gun his empty. daniel and marcel run towards zero, firing their guns as fast as they can pull the trigger. marcel takes aim and fires. the wiseguy's dive for cover as marcel blazes away until his gun is empty. we hear tires screeching as the impala backs up. the wiseguys shoot, blowing out the back window. they move in on marcel and zero. daniel runs forward with two guns firing at the wiseguys. as he nears marcel he throws the extra gun to him. slow motion :on the gun as it flies through the air. slow motion: one of the wiseguys has almost circle around the car. slow motion: on the gun has it flies through the air. real time on marcel: he looks to his left just as the gun arrives. it hits him on the forehead and knocks him down. daniel fires a few shots driving the wiseguy back. he runs over and with marcel's help they grab zero and help him to the car. they dive into the back seat. the car screeches forward and races out of the garage. silence. the staircase door opens and an exhausted joey "two tons" steps out, gasping for air.}
