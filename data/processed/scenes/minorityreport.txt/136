<L>__{interior precog chamber}
<A>__{power has been restored to precrime headquarters. witwer walks slowly through the ruins of the chamber. emt teams work on ennis page and the other dazed personnel anderson has left in his wake. technicians cluster around the two remaining precogs, the brothers. their eyes are closed and they are limp. their lips move soundlessly as if in conversation with each other. lieutenant glaser is with him, but when witwer speaks it is almost to himself.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{why didn't the precogs know he was coming to do this?}
<A>__{the lieutenant has no reply. witwer runs both hands through his hair. it has begun to wear him down, the ticking of the clock ...}
<C>__{witwer }
<D>__{the next time he shows up it'll be to kill me.}
<C>__{lieutenant glaser}
<D>__{we won't let that happen, sir.}
<A>__{witwer takes in the chaotic scene around him, then gives the lieutenant a withering look.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{you won't, huh?}
<A>__{when the lieutenant tries to speak to him, witwer walks away and goes over to the technicians working on the precogs. he stares at the precogs.}
<C>__{witwer }
<P>__{(to a technician)}
<D>__{when can we get these things operational?}
<C>__{technician}
<D>__{they're a hive mind, sir. it takes three for their predictive abilities to be fully operational.}
<A>__{which witwer does not want to hear. witwer leans very close to the technician.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{these two are all i have to find the man who is about to murder me. hook them up, and flood them with whatever kind of fucking chemicals you have to. they are a machine, and i need that machine at my disposal.}
<A>__{the precogs's lips stop for a microsecond, and then begin their silent movements again.}
