<L>__{exterior beverly's house (town) day}
<A>__{beverly uncoils a hose, cranks a spigot. she sprays her vegetable garden with water. after a beat, a solid object is coughed up through the hose. beverly continues watering. two more unidentified objects are spewed from the hose. she reacts by cranking the spigot on full. the water sprays harder. then inexplicably stops. beverly checks the spigot. she looks into the opening of the hose. puts it to her ear and listens. sniffs. now she puts the end of the hose in her mouth and sucks deeply, trying to siphon away the blockage. beverly removes the hose. a faint rumbling sound. she puts it back in her mouth and sucks. a solid object comes through the hose and into her mouth. then another. and another. a dozen things pump through the hose and into her mouth. beverly yanks it out. water spews from her mouth and out of the hose. apparently the blockage has cleared. beverly falls to her knees. hunching forward. she vomits forth a stomach full of water... and small spiders. mouth agape. eyes wide in horror. she watches them scurry into the garden. beverly tries to scream... but can only retch.}
