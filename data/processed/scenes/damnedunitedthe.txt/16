<D>__{...i also did it under the assumption that you'd be coming here wanting the best for the club. for the city of leeds. so why do i still get the feeling this is all about you and don?}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{of course it's just about me and don. always has been. but instead of putting frowns on your foreheads, o ye elders of leeds, in your blazers and brass fucking buttons, it should put big white colgate smiles on your big white faces, because it means i won't sleep and won't eat until i take whatever that man's achieved and beaten it beaten it so i never have to hear the name "don fucking revie" again beat it so the only name anyone sings in their yorkshire ale houses, raising their stinking jars to their stinking mouths, is brian clough. brian clough uber fucking alles. understand?}
<A>__{the blazers and brass buttons, white haired elders of leeds stare at one another.}
