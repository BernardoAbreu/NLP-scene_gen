<L>__{exterior islet beach morning}
<A>__{close on jack's face, dead asleep, lying in the sunlight. his nose twitches. a bit of smoke drifts by. his nose twitches again. his eyes open. jack groans and sits up. he rubs his head, looks over all of the foliage in the middle of the island is on fire. smoke rises high up into the clear blue sky. jack leaps to his feet. he sees elizabeth, as she pours out the last of the rum, dowsing a scrub brush at the base of a palm tree. it goes up in flames. she rolls the barrel forward it starts to burn merrily. jack can't believe his eyes.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what are you doing? you've burned our food, the shade the rum!}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{yes, the rum is gone.}
<A>__{she wipes her hands together. one of the rum barrels in the fire explodes.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{one, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels. two }
<A>__{she points to the sky.}
<C>__{elizabeth }
<D>__{that signal is over a thousand feet high, which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction. the entire royal navy is out to sea looking for me do you think there is even a chance they could mass it?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you you burned up the island, for a one time chance at being spotted?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{exactly.}
<A>__{elizabeth turns toward the sea.}
<C>__{elizabeth }
<D>__{just you wait, captain. in an hour, maybe two, keep a 'weather eye open' and you'll be seeing white sails on that horizon!}
<A>__{she sits down, determined. shields her eyes, scans the water, waiting, searching. jack is speechless. he throws up his hands, stalks up the sand dune, just to get away from her.}
