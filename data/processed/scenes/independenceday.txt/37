<A>__{racing over back roads behind a long open field, miguel rides his beat up motor bike, searching. looking up he sees something in the air. miguel's pov an old bi wing airplane converted into a crop duster, buzzes overhead. spraying insecticide wildly, the plane zigzags over the field.}

<D>__{russell! god damn it, russell!}
<A>__{looking down from the cockpit, russell brennon waves stupidly. shaggy blonde hair and two days' growth, russell is the image of a fifty one year old little boy. miguel follows him below, screaming at him. russell, flying recklessly, looks down at miguel not understanding. by the time he looks back he sees...}

<A>__{at the edge of the field, nearly on top of him. in a trick move, russell turns the plane on its side, and slices through the narrow gap between the trees. miguel screams with delight at his prowess. miguel looks pissed. angle other side of trees moments later miguel races over, skidding to a halt next to the landed bi with plane.}

<D>__{damn it, he was doing you a favor. you know how hard it is to find someone who doesn't think you're completely crazy? what are we supposed to do now? huh? where are we supposed to go now?}
<A>__{pissed, miguel peels away, kicking gravel back at russell. pathetically, he reaches into his jacket and pulls out a bottle of jack daniels. he takes a healthy swig.}
