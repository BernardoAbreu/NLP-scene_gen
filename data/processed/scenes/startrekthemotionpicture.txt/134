<A>__{on spock close as kirk's voice stops and all that is heard now is the heavy static crackling ominously. spock's expression flickers, then he hits reverse thruster jets, stops he turns to glance at the inner wall, then his thrusters turn him so he can look back the way he came from. but he cannot resist kirk's call; he suddenly hits his thruster controls, then jets flare, and: wider angle spock as thruster jets accelerate him back toward kirk.}
