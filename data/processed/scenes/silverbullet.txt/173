<L>__{interior uncle al, marty, tammy, and mrs. sturmfuller in a pew}
<A>__{as we look at them, from left to right: uncle al, marty, tammy, mrs. sturmfuller. uncle al unobtrusively takes a small silver flask from his hip pocket. engraved on it in old english letters is the word "rotgut." he spins the cap and takes a quick knock. he pauses and glances at marty, who looks deeply stunned.}
<P>__{jane (v o continues)}
<D>__{...they didn't at all mind drafting him. as to the sort of comfort uncle al may have been able to offer him...}
<A>__{uncle al hands the flask to marty. marty looks at him questioningly for a moment, and then drinks. marty looks at tammy, who looks frankly terrible. her mother is looking away. marty nudges her. she looks around at him. he offers her the flask. her eyes widen.}
<P>__{jane (v o continues)}
<D>__{...i now believe that was best kept between the two of them...}
<A>__{after a brief moment's consideration, tammy takes the flask and has a deep swallow. she hands the flask back to marty, who hands it quickly back to uncle al as tammy coughs. her mother looks at her... then at marty and uncle al. uncle al smiles sympathetically, hiding the flask with one hand, as if to say, "isn't it a terrible thing?" mrs. sturmfuller looks distractedly back toward the service.}
<P>__{jane (v o concludes)}
<D>__{...or among the three of them.}
<A>__{uncle al pockets the flask just as the organ stops playing.}
