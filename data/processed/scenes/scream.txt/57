<A>__{mr. himbry sits at his desk staring at the ghosts masks before him. he picks one of them up, snickering.}
<C>__{mr. himbry}
<D>__{damn...}
<A>__{he stands and moves to the closet next to his office door. he pulls it open to reveal a mirror hooked inside the door. he tries the mask on, pulling it over his face, looking in the mirror when... a knock at the door stops him. he rips the mask off his head, turns to his office door and opens it to reveal... an empty doorway. he pokes his head into the outer office area and looks around. but no one's there.}
<C>__{mr. himbry}
<D>__{yes? hello?}
<A>__{the place is empty. a little suspicious he closes the door, catching his reflection in the closet mirror. he looks at the mask in his hands. jesus, even he's jumpy. two seconds later... another knock at the door. himbry grabs the door quickly, this time throwing it open. again no one's there. he steps out into the outer office determined to catch a prankster.}
