<L>__{int: night j.c.'s straight puerto rican apartment}
<A>__{a cheerful apartment. quite different in atmosphere from the stairwell, above. a large, multi generation puerto rican family sits around the dinner table, eating chicken on rice and beans. jc is at the table. religious artifacts abound. a coded knock on the door. jc jumps up to answer it. it's lt. (the hideous stairs led here.) jc lets him in.}
<C>__{jc}
<D>__{how are you doing, man?}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{very good. very good. the mets are gonna win tomorrow.}
<A>__{jc notes lt's bizarre manner. decides to humor his paranoid catatonia.}
<C>__{jc}
<D>__{i know. here. just a moment.}
<A>__{jc reaches into a bookcase, looking for something. meanwhile, lt looks around the room. pov lt a shrine is in the corner. candles are lit before plaster saints, african deities, other icons abstruse and exotic. a large "madonna and child", painted on black velvet, hangs above the shrine. the madonna and child are black. lt takes this all in. jc startles him. jc is holding a cigar box. he opens it. it's full of cash. jc hands it to lt.}
<C>__{jc}
<D>__{this should be it. oh, wait.}
<P>__{(to an old woman at the table)}
<D>__{mamacita?}
<A>__{mamacita takes some vials of crack out of her apron. smiles. jc takes them from her, give them to lt.}
<C>__{jc}
<D>__{there. now you've got your profit and more. you'll have more product day after tomorrow, right?}
<C>__{lt}
<P>__{(very spaced)}
<D>__{uh right. sure. the mets are gonna win tomorrow.}
<C>__{jc}
<D>__{i know.}
<P>__{(beat looks at lt with concern)}
<D>__{take care of yourself, man, ok? be cool.}
<A>__{lt nods, puts mamacita's crack vials in his pocket. he notices that pov lt cu the cigar box is inlaid with a cross, made of costume jewels. other strange symbols surround it. it could be cursed or blessed. lt turns to go. the door closes behind him. he's gone.}
