<A>__{the old man puffs away at his trusty pipe. now he lays it down. kicking bird and dances with wolves are waiting patiently.}
<C>__{ten bears}
<D>__{it's hard to know what to do.}
<A>__{the old man gets up, walks to his bedside, reaches up into the sacred rigging above an takes down a melon sized rawhide bundle. he brings this back to the fire and unwraps it slowly. inside is a rusted hunk of metal, the helmet of a spanish conquistador.}
<C>__{ten bears}
<D>__{the men who wore this came in the time of my grandfather's grandfather. eventually, we drove them out. then the mexicans came. in my own time the whites came... the texans. they have been like all the others who find something they want in our country. they take it without asking. i have always been a peaceful man, happy to be in my own country and wanting nothing from the white people. nothing at all. but i think you are right. i think they will keep coming. when i think of that, i look at this bundle. our country is all that we want. we will fight to keep it.}
<A>__{he picks up his pipe and puffs deeply.}
<C>__{ten bears}
<D>__{tomorrow morning we will strike the village and go to the winter camp.}
