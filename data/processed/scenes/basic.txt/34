<L>__{exterior obstacle course. one week ago evening}
<A>__{the six members of section eight on a forced run through the rain. we focus in each face as dunbar describes them. first up is mueller a tall aryan looking blonde with a square jaw.}
<C>__{dunbar }
<D>__{mueller was from tulsa, a real good ol' boy type. one of those "his daddy's daddy's daddy died at bull run and no bleeding heart yankee was gonna take away his scatter gun" . he idolized west.}
<A>__{muller, grinning, as west kicks his ass to pick up the pace. next to him is nunez, a strapping hulk of a manchild.}
<C>__{dunbar }
<D>__{and nunez idolized mueller. big fella from new mexico. after he got sectioned he just followed mueller around like a lap dog. he wasn't mean like mueller, though, didn't have it in him.}
<A>__{next to nunez is childs, small and weasely with feral eyes.}
<C>__{dunbar }
<D>__{but childs did. didn't talk to anyone, but you got this feeling something was wrong with him, like real wrong. type of guy you felt uncomfortable going to sleep near.}
<A>__{behind childs runs pike.}
<C>__{dunbar }
<D>__{pike i told you about. he took the brunt of it from mueller and west. once they found it out he was a convict they were merciless. dunbar (v.o.) (cont'd) he'd been busted for auto theft, judge gave him the option of jailor the army. he made the wrong choice.}
<A>__{next to pike, dunbar and kendall run side by side. kendall is short like childs, but also weak. wheezing.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{finally kendall and me. kendall was a smart guy, we got along okay. pike and i tried to help him, but...}
<A>__{kendall falters and pike stops to try and help him up. west smacks the him away, practically kicking kendall to his feet.}
<C>__{dunbar }
<D>__{he was sickly. had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?}
<C>__{osborne }
<D>__{epilepsy.}
<C>__{dunbar }
<D>__{yeah. spent half his time in the infirmary. only reason he enlisted was his father. west didn't section him till last week.}
