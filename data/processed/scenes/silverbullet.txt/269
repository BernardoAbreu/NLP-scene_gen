<L>__{exterior the path between the house and the garage}
<A>__{marty comes slowly up the path. we hear soft grunts of exertion; he's still hand turning the wheels for the sake of silence, and it's hard work. he stops at the line of bushes and gets the bag of fireworks. he puts it on his lap and starts moving again.}
<L>__{exterior the coslaw driveway, from the road}
<A>__{the driveway has a slight downslant, and marty coasts easily out to the road. he turns right and begins to roll slowly along the verge of the highway, still using his hands. we can see that the light is still on upstairs. marty turns back once to verify this himself, then keeps on going. he's not going to be deprived of his treat.}
