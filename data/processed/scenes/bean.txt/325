<L>__{interior hospital. corridor day.}
<A>__{bean exits from the theatre still in gown and mask, followed by the assistant. the police side kick is waiting.}
<D>__{side kick any news on the chief?.}
<C>__{assistant}
<D>__{there certainly is. dr bean here just saved his life.}
<A>__{side kick's eyes water. he's choked. bean shakes his hand nervously, and heads on fast before he's found out. he turns the corner and suddenly sees david and alison, still seated. alison sees him.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{0 my god.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{sorry, honey he just happened to tag along.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{nothing ever really changes, does it, david?}
<A>__{she turns her head away: the bond of the moments before is gone. bean looks very contrite. at that moment, another doctor walks by.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<C>__{doctor 2}
<D>__{yes, your doctor will be with you in a minute. we have a lot to deal with here, sir.}
<A>__{alison looks round, and shakes her head. bean kicks david in the shins. david looks round, puzzled. there is a poster of the human skeleton. bean points to the spine. david looks but cannot fathom a relevant meaning from it. another doctor comes along the same one who they spoke to first. he's young, confident slightly arrogant.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{excuse me, doctor.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{really ma'am, we'll get to you in due course.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{david looks at the poster opposite again. spine, ribcage, skull. looks back at bean gesturing to it. this time the penny drops! spine spineless!}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{say that again, son.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{i beg your pardon?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i said say that again, son because the next time you do, i will make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{i'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{we have. in fact, we've been sitting here since the start of the millennium and i'd really like some action from you before the end of the world.}
<A>__{a hint of a smile arrives on alison's lips. she's heard that somewhere before.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{so, why not haul your ... (checks) nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{okay, sir. certainly. good.}
<A>__{david turns to alison she does a little tilt of her head `wow'. and he turns to bean, who points to himself, and nods .... n come on!}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yes, and bean, for god's sake, keep out of the goddamn way, will you?}
<A>__{bean nods enthusiastically and backs off.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{smiling well, well.}
