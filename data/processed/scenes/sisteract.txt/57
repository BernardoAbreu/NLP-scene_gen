<L>__{interior convent crafts room}
<A>__{this is a large, open room where the nuns create various gift items which the convent sells to support itself. several nuns sit at a table, diligently hand painting christmas cards and making christmas tree ornaments. on the other side of the room is a large, free standing loom, which resembles a grand piano. the loom is wooden; a tapestry is half completed. mary patrick is seated at the loom, which is a complicated mechanism. christy stands beside her.}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<D>__{the minute i saw you. i said to myself, she's a weaver. have you ever used a loom?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{not in years.}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<D>__{well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy. i'm working on a wall hanging, of the convent.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<D>__{to sell, of course. i hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at st. katherine's. we need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{but don't you get money? from the vatican?}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<D>__{mary clarence. goose. we're completely self supporting. like all convents. like yours.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{oh, right. at my old place, we used to... wash cars. groom dogs. so... nice loom.}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<D>__{isn't it lovely? now i will demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.}
<P>__{(as she deftly works the loom)}
<D>__{you just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed. then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed. shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed. keep tension on the warp. is that clear?}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(pretending to be fascinated)}
<D>__{just about. show me again.}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<D>__{you betcha.}
<A>__{crafts room an hour later angle on the wall hanging, which has progressed considerably. angle on christy, leaning against the wall, thumbing through a magazine. angle on mary patrick, hard at work at the loom.}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<D>__{shuttle, beat, shed. and watch your heddles.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{i love my heddles. show me again.}
<A>__{mother superior appears.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{mary clarence how is your weaving progressing?}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<D>__{oh, she's doing just fine, reverend mother }
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{really catching on.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{good. mary patrick, i need you in the office. mary clarence, carry on.}
<A>__{mother superior gestures to the loom. christy sits at the loom, and waves as mother superior and mary patrick exit. christy stares at the loom; a look of horror crosses her face. she has not been paying attention to mary patrick's instructions. she cracks her knuckles, as if she were about to play the piano. she grabs two parts of the loom, at random. she moves these parts. angle on the loom. as a result of christy's movements, the loom collapses, piece by piece. the tapestry unravels, the many skeins of wool snap, and the mechanical apparatus disintegrates, until finally the entire loom shudders and falls to the floor, as christy watches, aghast.}
