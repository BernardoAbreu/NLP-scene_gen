<L>__{interior jeremiah's house day}
<A>__{bill in a kind of shock can only lie in his bedroom, staring at the ceiling. tia's out in the living room, sitting on the couch weeping in her mother's arms. patrick's in the bathroom tending the bloody scratches on his back and arms. he's frightened. and angry. he storms out of the bathroom, down the hall to his father's office.}
<L>__{interior jeremiah's study continuous}
<A>__{as patrick slams the door behind him, jeremiah hides a stack of papers and photos beneath a pile on his desk.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{did you do it?}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{sure, son. i went down there and torched the place myself.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{you could have had it done. you didn't want us there.}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{i wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out. i was trying to protect you.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{from what?}
<A>__{jeremiah can't answer. but patrick's not leaving it alone.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{why? why did you give a shit about the building? why did you care that we were there of all places?}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{it's...it's a bad neighborhood. as you can see now.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{bullshit, dad. don't front me. for once. just tell me the truth. i came from there, too.}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{you were just a kid.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{i saw your face. you knew that place. you knew those people.}
<C>__{jeremiah}
<D>__{that's the past. it's dead.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{dead? i don't think your past is dead.}
<P>__{(points to the bandages)}
