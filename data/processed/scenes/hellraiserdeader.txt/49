<L>__{interior hotel bathroom night}
<A>__{amy smashes through a vertical plane of safety glass, smashing it into a thousand tiny fragments as she goes crashing back, through it... her head hits hard against a tile wall and she goes sliding down, in the dark, her hand scrambling for something to hold onto. her reaching hand grabs some metal handle. she pulls... and abruptly, water begins to cascade down onto her face. she turns herself sideways and rolls over, gasping. she's in a bathtub... in fact she's just been thrown through the safety glass door. she scrambles over the bottom edge of the sliding glass door, scraping herself across the tiny pegs of glass that still line the border of the frame. she pulls herself up, her hand feeling for a light switch... finally, she finds it, flips the switch. she's in the hotel bathroom, slumped over against the sink. soaking wet, scratched, shaking, gasping, she stares at herself in the mirror. there's a tiny square of glass stuck into her shoulder. she tugs it loose. it clinks as she drops it into the sink.}

<A>__{she lifts her hand to wipe the wet hair from her face... then pauses. she turns toward the bathtub. she reaches through the shattered door and turns off the shower.}
