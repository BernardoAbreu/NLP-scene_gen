<L>__{exterior radio station day later}
<A>__{bangs walks with william on this sharply inclined san diego street. it's early, the streets are silent. bangs is about fifteen beer pounds overweight. his jeans are loose, his paleness and messy moustache an emblem of the long days and nights spent writing. in there somewhere is a good looking guy. his hands are thrust deeply into his pockets, and he takes big sweeping steps.}
<C>__{bangs}
<D>__{so you're the one who's been sending me those articles from your school newspaper }
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i've been doing some stuff for a local underground paper, too.}
<C>__{bangs}
<D>__{what are you like the star of your school?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{they hate me.}
<C>__{bangs}
<D>__{you'll meet them all again on their long journey to the middle.}
<A>__{the kid nods, they walk.}
<C>__{bangs }
<D>__{well, your writing is damn good. it's just a shame you missed out on rock and roll.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i did?}
<C>__{bangs}
<D>__{oh yeah. it's over.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{over?}
<C>__{bangs}
<D>__{over. you got here just in time for the death rattle, the last gasp, the last grope.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{well. at least i'm here for that.}
<A>__{bangs looks at the much smaller kid, shaking his head. it's too late for newcomers. but if the kid's age is an issue, he doesn't mention it. like a machine gun:}
<C>__{bangs}
<D>__{what do you type on?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{smith corona galaxis deluxe.}
<C>__{bangs}
<D>__{you like the new lou reed?}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(automatic)}
<D>__{the early stuff. the new stuff, he's trying to be bowie, he should be himself. i'm not a big lou man.}
<C>__{bangs}
<D>__{yeah, but if bowie's doing lou, and lou's doing bowie, lou's still doing lou.}
<C>__{william}
<P>__{(standing his ground)}
<D>__{if you like lou.}
<C>__{bangs}
<D>__{take drugs?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{bangs}
<D>__{smart kid. i used to do speed and sometimes nyquil and stay up all night writing and writing, like 25 pages of dribble about, you know, the guess who, or coltrane, just to write, you know, with the music blasting... william me too.}
<A>__{the writing part... for a moment, the serious demeanor dissolves and the oddest thing happens. bangs laughs. it's an odd and charming laugh, the kind a tough guy keeps well hidden. it surprised the kid, who smiles back. bangs stops at the corner, and offers a pleasant but very final nod of the head.}
<C>__{bangs}
<D>__{well, alright. it's been nice to meet you. i will see you around. keep sending me your stuff.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{okay. see you.}
<C>__{bangs}
<D>__{i can't stand here all day talking to my many fans.}
<A>__{wide shot solitude but neither have anywhere to go on this early downtown morning. they stand for a beat, hands in pockets, on this deserted street. they are alone together, there's nobody else in sight.}
