<L>__{interior la improv, showroom late night}
<A>__{very late a clock says 1:15. a young comic is onstage, performing to the dozen audience members left. in back walks... andy. unshaven, morose, he quietly approaches paternal owner budd friedman. budd sees him, grins, and gives him a hearty hug. andy points at the stage and asks for something budd eagerly nods.}
<L>__{interior la improv, showroom later that night}
<A>__{budd is onstage.}
<C>__{budd}
<D>__{and now we have a treat for you late night diehards. the star of taxi here in person, andy kaufman!}
<A>__{the sparse crowd applauds. budd leaves, and andy shuffles up.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{actually, budd, you're wrong. i found out today that taxi's been canceled.}
<A>__{the crowd awwwws sadly. andy blinks.}
<C>__{andy }
<D>__{yeah, that's how i felt too... though i don't know why. 'cause for years, all i wanted to do was get off that show.}
<P>__{(quiet, very confessional)}
<D>__{but now that nobody will hire me, and nobody thinks i'm funny... i guess it was probably a pretty good job.}
<A>__{one guy laughs sharply. andy gives him a look thinks then continues.}
<C>__{andy }
<D>__{not to mention that my wife has left me. and she took the kids.}
<P>__{(he sighs)}
<D>__{i don't know what i'm gonna do with myself. my options are sorta limited...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{this morning, i noticed i've got a cyst, or some kind of boil, on the back of my neck. it's really disgusting. look.}
<A>__{andy turns. the red lump is bigger, grosser. the crowd groans, revolted.}
<C>__{andy }
<D>__{so i was thinking, since i'm sort of a quasi celebrity, that i could charge people to touch it.}
<P>__{(candid)}
<D>__{does anybody want to pay a buck to touch my cyst?}
<A>__{a couple stoners giggle and clap. andy coughs, then frowns.}
<C>__{andy }
<D>__{i'm serious.}
<A>__{a pause... then a few curious people walk up to the stage. the first taker is a goofy blonde woman. she starts to reach for the cyst when andy stops her.}
<C>__{andy }
<D>__{no, no, you gotta pay first.}
<A>__{she nods, discomforted, and reaches for her purse...}
