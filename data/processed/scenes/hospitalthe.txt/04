<L>__{interspersed with credits, the following scenes:}
<A>__{room 806. night dark. just a bit of moonlight streaking through the not quite closed bathroom. the hallway door opens, and a young woman, carrying a top coat, slips quickly in giggling like hell, followed by schaefer, who is likewise giggling and admonishing her to be quiet. her name is sheila. sheila notices the other patient in the room sleeping away and looks questioningly at schaefer, who reassures her as he removes her coat. after which he strips off his own white jacket and trousers and hangs them in the armoire. the girl asks in a hoarse whisper if they're going to get totally nude and wonders if that's such a good idea. for an answer, schaefer fondles her crotch. they both giggle, they both shush each other, they giggle again; they're both stoned. the girl unzippers her dress. the dark room is filled for the moment with the flurry of undressing, flung garments, elbows, legs and arms, bumpings into each other, and sheila saying between giggles, "boy, i sure hope nobody walks in." they eventually wind up on the unoccupied bed, and the scene ends looking across the sleeping profile of the patient in the other bed as schaefer and his girl thump away at each other with much creaking of springs, moans, groans, giggles and the white limbed patterns of fornication. room 806 dark, silent, hushed. the fun and games are over. sheila is in front of the armoire. she slips back into her dress, after which she tiptoes back to the bed where schaefer is deeply asleep, smiling in postcoital peace. sheila bends, shakes his shoulder.}
