<L>__{exterior the rectory night}
<A>__{a chevrolet with tarker's mills constable painted on the side in gold leaf pulls up. joe haller gets out, and as he does there's a business of pulling his pants legs down over his boots nice stitched cowboy boots, not black cop's shoes. we want the audience to notice these boots, remember them probably haller should wear them all through the picture. he goes up the walk. haller rings the doorbell. no one comes. haller rings the bell again. waits. no one comes. he leans down and looks through a side window.}
