<A>__{she plops back on the couch with stacy.}
<C>__{linda }
<D>__{i will bet he forgets to call again.}
<A>__{she notices that stacy is crying over the tv show.}
<C>__{linda }
<D>__{god, stacy, it's not that sad. it's just david soul and ricardo montalban.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{i don't know, i'm just so depressed. everything is just so... depressing.}
<A>__{linda shuts off the television.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{you have been acting very strange the last few weeks.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{i don't know... i just don't feel right.}
<A>__{linda sits down next to stacy on the bed.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{what do you think it is?}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{what do you think it is?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{it couldn't be.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{it could be. i had a pregnancy test at the clinic. i will find out monday. i guess it was damone.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{of course it was damone. if it was ron johnson, you'd be out to here!}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{i'm not going to tell him. he's an asshole. i hate him.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{but it costs money to have an abortion. even at the free clinic. you tell damone to pay for it. it's the least he can do. it's the guy's responsibility too.}
<A>__{she puts the tv back on and they watch.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{you know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{you didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{you're right. i didn't tell you that.}
