<L>__{exterior rear of terminal building night}
<A>__{sarg (imagine george kennedy), dressed in a tuxedo, tie undone, with a huge cigar, which he eats during the conversation, talks to his wife on his car phone. a worker in hard hat waits next to him. behind the worker are fuel drums and a large sign that reads: danger, fuel absolutely no smoking, absolutely no spitting.}

<D>__{marge, you better go without me. we've got a condition red.}
<B>__{split screen with wife at home.}
<C>__{marge}
<P>__{(in evening gown, a cigar stuck in her mouth)}
<D>__{we've got a condition red with our marriage. i think you're in love with that shuttle, not with me. i want a divorce, sarg.}
<A>__{sarg lights his cigar.}
<C>__{sarg}
<D>__{is there someone else, marge? is that it?}
<A>__{sarg throws the lit match towards the "absolutely no smoking" sign. the worker grimaces but nothing happens.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{sarg, there's been someone else for fifteen years. you were just too involved in your work to see it.}
<A>__{they hang up. sarg bites off the end of his cigar and spits it in the direction of the "no spitting" sign, blowing the worker out of frame with a massive explosion. sarg hops into his car, takes a lava lamp from the seat and puts it on the car roof like kojak's flasher. the lamp flashes, the siren wails, as sarg pulls away.}
