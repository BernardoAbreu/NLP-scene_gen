<A>__{soldiers pick themselves up just in time to hear another engine a super powerful track bike, emerges from the burnt rubber smoke screen. a wheely bar on the back of the bike keeps it from flipping around the rear tire as it accelerates like a bullet out of a barrel. there isnt even time to take a shot until shes gone.}
<L>__{interior countach (matrix) day}
<A>__{they rocket up the entry to a highway, ripping past cars by driving up the breakdown lane. once they hit a straightaway trinity floors it, and the speedo creeps up past 130 as they dodge in and out of cars. morpheus grabs his twisted, folded legs. he was literally poured into the seat. concentrating, his face knotting in pain, he straightens the broken, fractured legs. he closes his eyes and concentrates.}
<D>__{the legs reform into straight, strong limbs. morpheus grabs the wheel.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{keep your foot on the gas. heal thyself.}
<A>__{trinity pulls her bleeding wound from her arm. her face tightens, and she closes her eyes, fervently concentrating, shutting the world out, which is good, as they suffer constant close calls as morpheus controls the wheel from his awkward spot. when she opens her eyes again, she grabs the wheel. with both hands. morpheus pulls out his cell and tries the line. its still full of static.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{any luck?}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{none. theyve killed city wide comms.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{then the agents are out of touch with each other.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<A>__{"they cant track us, but that gives them more time to destroy our exits, and find the neb. well try the desert. communications might be}
<D>__{working there still."}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{what about niobe?}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{she knows to meet us there.}
