<A>__{in the dining room, zindzi looks down at a big front page}
<B>__{photo of mandela and pienaar shaking hands.}
<A>__{she is a modern, cosmopolitan young woman. when mandela enters, zindzi looks up from the newspaper with a very mandela like grunt.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{zindzi}
<D>__{it doesn't matter what i think.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{yes, it does.}
<C>__{zindzi}
<P>__{(defiant)}
<D>__{okay. i think he looks like one of the policemen who forced us out of our house when you were in jail. i don't like seeing you shake his hand. and i'm not the only one.}
<A>__{mandela overreacts.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{you criticize without understanding. you seek only to address your own feelings. this is selfish thinking. it does not serve the nation.}
<A>__{zindzi shakes her head, turns, leaves.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{wait. please. i }
<A>__{mandela wants to apologize, doesn't know how. instead, he pulls an envelope out of his pocket, holds it out.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{will you give this to your mother.}
<C>__{zindzi}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{a bracelet.}
<A>__{zindzi looks into the envelope. in it is the beaded bracelet, from earlier, from the bathroom.}
<C>__{zindzi}
<D>__{just throw it away.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{i don't have the right to. it's not mine.}
<C>__{zindzi}
<D>__{if she left it here, she meant to throw it away.}
<A>__{only children know how to twist the dagger so deftly. mandela turns away so that his daughter cannot see his eyes. a man so at ease with strangers does not know how to talk to his own family.}
