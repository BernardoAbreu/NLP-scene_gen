<L>__{exterior annie's backyard morning}
<A>__{flowers and birdfeeders everywhere. and, 60 feet away in complete, oversized catcher's gear jackson in a catcher's crouch nuke stares, in his street clothes, but now with a glove and ball.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in here, hum babe }
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{that's not necessary, jackson }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{okay, nuke, now lean in for the sign.}
<A>__{he does. jackson flashes some ridiculous signs.}
<C>__{nuke}
<D>__{this in ridiculous. i'm a pro.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{just do what i say. now, which nostril are you breathing through?}
<C>__{nuke}
<D>__{which nostril am i breathing through?}
<A>__{annie puts her hand under his nose.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{the right nostril. good.}
<C>__{nuke}
<D>__{my right nostril?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{there are two important psychic conduits called the "pingala" and the "ida". the pingala starts with the left testicle (or left ovary of the female) and ends at the right nostril.}
<A>__{she touches his left nut through his pants in a matter of fact manner. he stares back.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{the ida originates at the right testicle (or ovary) and terminates at the left nostril.}
<C>__{nuke}
<D>__{i'm really beat. i need some serious "z's" }
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{the pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.}
<C>__{nuke}
<D>__{switch nostrils?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{right. okay, fire a couple in there.}
<A>__{nuke tosses an easy pitch to jackson. annie's incensed.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{you're patronizing me! i will not be patronized }
<C>__{nuke}
<D>__{if i throw too hard i will hurt the kid.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{he's handled a lotta pitchers whose records were better than one and six.}
<A>__{nuke gets a little steamed. he feels his nostril, winds, and fires a medium speed fastball to jackson.}
<C>__{nuke}
<P>__{(a bit angry)}
<D>__{how was that?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{a little better.}
<C>__{nuke}
<D>__{gimme the god damn ball!}
<A>__{nuke winds up and fires a pitch to jackson. alas the ball sails through a window crashing glass.}
<C>__{nuke}
<P>__{(cynically)}
<D>__{how ya like that?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{much better. your delivery was fully integrated because you weren't thinking about it 'cause you were pissed off at me.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{this is progress.}
<A>__{nuke smiles and gives in. and reaches for her.}
<C>__{nuke}
<D>__{i give up. let's go inside, make love, and fall asleep till it's time to go to the ballpark.}
<A>__{she takes his hand and leads him up to the back porch.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{or...}
<P>__{(taking his hand)}
<D>__{...we could just take that sexual energy and save it for a few hours and re channel it into your pitching tonight.}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{c'mon, jackson, i've got some lemonade!}
<A>__{jackson runs over in full gear to join them. sitting on the back porch a pitcher of lemonade.}
<C>__{nuke}
<D>__{i can't keep up with you. first you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher now no sex is gonna do it?!}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{it's all the same thing.}
<A>__{suddenly nuke's face is filled with alarm he points.}
<C>__{nuke}
<D>__{what's that?!}
<A>__{ p.o.v. a cardboard box on a table nearby scrawled in larged letters on the side are the words "max patkin".}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(matter of factly)}
<D>__{that's max. his ashes anyway. he left no kin...}
<A>__{nuke stares, unsettled.}
<C>__{nuke}
<D>__{god... i think i'm gonna be sick }
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{oh don't be silly. death is nothing to be scared of. it's just another way of living. it's just a fresh start kinda like spring training.}
<A>__{nuke thinks about this carefully. looks at the ashes, at annie, and at jackson, in full gear, mask on his head.}
<C>__{nuke}
<D>__{death is like spring training?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{yes. and so is birth. now look me in the eyes, nuke }
<P>__{(sweetly accusing him)}
<D>__{you haven't been wearing my panties, have you?}
<A>__{close on nuke utterly bewildered.}
