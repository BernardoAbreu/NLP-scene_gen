<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{i'm an extremely important waiter.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{what can i get you?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i don't want to know what it is, i just want to order the most expensive thing on the menu.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i will have the duck. and i think you look like a little rat faced man.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{okay, i will have those right up for you.}
<A>__{the waiter leaves. mark and jennifer stare at each other for a short beat. something has changed between them and they can both feel it.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{things seem to be turning around for you.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{today is the best day of my life. hands down. easy. best day.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{it's not every day you unearth a monumental historical event and sell it for a ton of money.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{that wasn't the best part. it was great, but it wasn't the peak of my day.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i've had a crush on you ever since i saw a picture of you on greg's refrigerator two years ago.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{the best part of my day today is right now, sitting at this table here with you.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you're the most beautiful woman i've ever seen in my life, and you're special... and it makes me happy to be around you.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{jennifer is touched...but she doesn't reciprocate mark's feelings. jennifer moves on.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{tell me something about your family. i really don't know much about you.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{ah, my family. we're what you'd probably call "not lucky". my whole family is kind of marked by tragedy, bad luck and general... shittiness. it goes back a long ways and could probably drive someone to suicide just hearing about it, so i will keep it simple. my mom died when i was six. cancer.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{sad.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{and my dad got real depressed and lost his job. out of work and with a kid to raise he had no choice but to turn to a life of crime.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{what kind of crime?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{he was a robber. houses mostly.}
