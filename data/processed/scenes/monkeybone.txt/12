<L>__{interior car night moving}
<A>__{stu backs out of his space. the small parking lot is full of delivery trucks from would be merchandisers all too large for the spaces they're parked in. stu has to keep backing up because the exit lanes are blocked. it's like negotiating a labyrinth.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{look at this! he won't let us leave!}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{the monkey!! he's everywhere! he'll take over both our lives if we let him.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{stu stop it. that monkey is good luck. you thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. so relax! enjoy it!}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i'm trying. it's weird, that's all. i never had any good luck, until i met you...what if it's all just another bad dream?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{what's the "bad" part?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i might wake up.}
<C>__{julie}
<P>__{(laughing; taking his hand)}
<D>__{if you do, i will be right there beside you. so face it. you're just going to have to be happy!}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i am happy. it just so happens this is the happiest night of my life.}
<A>__{he says it so solemnly that she cracks up. after a moment he joins in.}
