<L>__{exterior seminary same time}
<A>__{the side door bursts outward and a limping figure emerges, frantically signaling for the chopper: timothy's got murder in his eye. the chopper banks, coming in low as he hauls himself aboard.}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{sir, your shoulder }
<C>__{timothy}
<D>__{fuck the shoulder, knee's worse. just bring me around and hold her steady. i'm not leaving until i know the bitch is dead.}
<A>__{he grabs an automatic rifle. back with caitlin underneath the tanker she adheres to charly's motionless form. looking small and terrified. whispers in her mother's ear. soft and low:}
<C>__{caitlin}
<D>__{mommy, get up now. you just stop it, mommy, you stop being a little baby. stop it, you're not dead, i know you're not dead so you get up now.}
<A>__{face contorted, she strikes out. flails. hits charly.}
<C>__{caitlin}
<D>__{don't you die, you get up now, goddammit...! life is pain, you just get used to it, and stand up right this minute, mommy. life is pain, do it, you bitch. do it.}
<A>__{tears coursing in rivulets. little fists clenched. then it might be a trick of the wind. tiny aspiration, not enough breath to fog a mirror...}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{...mommy... here...}
<A>__{a solitary tear appears in the wide open staring eye. one fingernail, then. scratches feebly. toes, shifting. seeking purchase. a hand, planting itself... teeth bared, a rictus of pain... rising up... standing. full height now, flexing one deadly arm. she hugs her daughter and says:}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{...you're grounded...}
<A>__{overhead, the howling of rotor blades. charly gasps for breath. cracks open the gun... no bullets. swell. scans the pavement... there. the mp 5 machine gun lies twenty feet from her. twenty miles, same difference. across the pavement, even farther away: timothy's car.}
