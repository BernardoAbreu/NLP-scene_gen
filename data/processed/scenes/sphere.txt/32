<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{long shot seeing them suspended high in the air on the catwalk, walking. their tiny streams of light moving about. we see just how ominous this spacecraft really is.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{it's empty. why would someone build a ship like this?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you'd have to ask them.}
<A>__{they approach a door, at the end of the catwalk.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{alright, beth, do that thing you did before.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{how about i just press the button?}
<A>__{she presses a button near the door. the door slides open.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{or just... press the button.}
<A>__{barnes holds out his gun, and enters. the others behind him.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{strange, isn't it? you know how it would have a button.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, ted.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{still, make a note i recognized that.}
<A>__{on barnes leading them through a small hall. it seems to be opening up into some sort of room when barnes stops. dead in his tracks.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{barnes}
<P>__{(serious)}
<D>__{what do you make of this?}
<A>__{on norman as he steps around barnes, his light brightening on: a sign that reads: "trash."}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{what the hell?}
<A>__{very softly, harry begins to laugh.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{english?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{that's right.}
<A>__{norman looks up and sees more of the room as his light shines throughout it: tables, couches and chairs made of leather, very comfortable looking. they begin to slowly wander about...}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i don't get it.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{it doesn't make any sense.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you don't think it does? i think it's rather obvious.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{is it some sort of joke? like one of those hoaxes?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{a spacecraft half a mile long with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it? someone went to a lot of trouble. try again.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{but it's impossible.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{is it?}
<A>__{beth touches the table, it's metal, but it's soft and rubbery.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{why would this ship carry instructions in english?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{think about it.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{unless, this alien spacecraft was you know somehow presenting itself to americans in a way that would make us feel comfortable.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{400 years ago? i'm sure christopher columbus would've loved these accomodations.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{good theory, ted.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{well, what's your theory?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i'm a woman. i don't theorize. i only deal with facts.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{all the facts you need are right in front of you.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{gimme a minute here... i think i've got it.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{do you?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{if it is an alien spacecraft }
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{save your breath. it's not an alien spacecraft.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{then what is it?}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's an american spacecraft.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{an american spacecraft? half a mile long? and buried 400 years? yeah, good theory, harry.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{it's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, captain? that's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it?}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{we had considered it.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{considered what? that it's american? how would you think it's american?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{the chip in the door.}
<A>__{on norman glancing up at harry...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{we take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal. yet any spacecraft even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour crashes into the water it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper. but there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere. not even a scratch.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{meaning?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{meaning it didn't land in the water.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{please. it must have flown here }
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{it didn't fly here. it rrived ere.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{arrived? from where?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{not where. when. 400 years ago. from our future.}
<A>__{a quiet moment as they take this in.}
