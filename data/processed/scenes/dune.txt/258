<D>__{two thumpers are planted. the worm may not surface for the first he will rise for the second. remember, when the worm approaches, you must be utterly still... and close enough to plant the hook firmly under a ring segment.... the worm will turn to lift this exposed area as far from the abrasive sand as possible and it will take you with it to the top. do not get too close as he approaches... the sand will engulf you.... wait till the head of the worm passes then go... quickly. stilgar & fremen shai hulud... shai hulud.}
<A>__{in the distance the telltale sound of the worm's approach begins. this worm is deep underground and the sound is low and the ground trembles violently.}
