<A>__{the small fire that never goes out has been enlarged to cook the day's meal. beyond the fire on a rock shelf hector plays with his children, a girl of six and boy of eight. it is the usual rough romp that fathers indulge in, but in 4000 bc possibly rougher than normal. hector is acting the part of some trapped wild animal, lashing out at the hunters surrounding him. but in his act of wild rage he gets carried away. he picks up his son and throws him hard, much too hard, on his back. the boy tumbles down from the shelf to the cave floor at his mother, deirdre's feet, howling in pain. deidre scowls at hector. if the gesture had been invented he would probably shrug his shoulders. the boy howls on. hector kneels beside his daughter, absorbed in her antics as she sleeps. she is a vivid dreamer. her whole little form wriggles and contorts in response to the fantasy unspooling in her head. she emits unearthly nighttime noises, squeals and giggles and moans. hector is fasci nated. where has his daughter gone? who is this strange wild creature that has taken her form, lying beside him? hector's daughter delights him. and while hector watches his daughter, deirdre from their bed watches hector. it is almost dawn, the cave is quiet and the fire has diminished. by its light we see deirdre and hector making love, on their bed of dried grass and skins. it's diffi cult to say what their lovemaking might look like. what has 6000 years done to that art? we will think about it. on the far side of the cave we see the sleeping children. as we move closer we see that they are far from sleep. two sets of bright eyes peek out from under their cover. we cut between : them, the loving parents and the watching, learning children. hector is arguing with his son, just outside their cave. the boy wants to go foraging with him again.}

<A>__{there is real anger in his voice. the boy wisely retreats to the cave. as hector turns to continue his walk alone he see deirdre looking at him accusingly from the entrance. she holds out her arms ready to comfort the boy rejected by his father. hector is in the classic, timeless, no win situation and he knows it. with a sigh of frustration he heads for the beach.}
