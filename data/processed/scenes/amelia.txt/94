<A>__{co eds gathered in the common room in robes and nightgowns. they fill the old couches, the mismatched easy chairs, curl up in blankets on the floor. pan to... ...amelia in flannel pajamas, sitting on the grand piano, pointing to the next question among the many raised hands.}
<D>__{co ed okay, it's all well and good to tell us to study whatever we want, and work at whatever we want, and not give a darn about what the world of men think...}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{...including them wanting us to say darn instead of damn.}
<A>__{laughter. the girl flushes a little, her point is a crucial one...}
<D>__{co ed but what about those of us who are getting married when we graduate? what advice do you have for us?}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{don't.}
<A>__{she meant that. and no one is laughing now.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{build your career first. and, surprisingly, that's the best thing you can do for your eventual marriage.}
<A>__{so many eager faces, so many disturbed ones.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{look. it starts with a strong sexual attraction, that the woman assumes must be love.}
<A>__{some heads are nodding. some eyes suspicious.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{everything works until the first financial crisis jars the man's confidence and threatens the woman's security. why...?}
<A>__{she looks from one to the nexterior}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{because she can't help. all she can be is dependent. because that is what she's been trained to be.}
<A>__{a phone rings. one of the girls snatches it up to cut off the interruption.}
<P>__{co ed #2 (hushed)}
<D>__{common room. oh. sure.}
<P>__{(hand over phone, to amelia)}
<D>__{he says he's the man in your life.}
<A>__{amelia hops off the piano. there are plenty of curious faces.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{trust me. only a husband talks like that.}
<A>__{in their laughter, she goes to the phone. everybody hangs on every word of...}
<C>__{amelia }
<D>__{yes? yes. yes...}

<D>__{me, too.}

<D>__{me, too. thanks for the roses.}

<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{can you women keep a secret?}
<A>__{they can. and boy, do they want to hear one.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{well, it’s no secret that i’m a bit driven, some might say obsessive, about my little flying adven tures...}
