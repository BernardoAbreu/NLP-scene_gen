<A>__{the double doors at the entrance slam open to reveal hok. indy is halfway along an unprotected wall back to his ventilation entry route. hok opens up on him, cutting off his retreat. indy jumps behind a marble column, which is promptly blasted with machine gun fire. indy looks above him, sees the giant disk of the gong. reaching up, pushing with tremendous effort, he maneuvers it off the hook. it bounces down to the floor on its side, chipping the marble with its monstrous weight. indy steadies it and then puts his whole body into rolling it across the room toward the window. as it starts to roll, indy slips behind it and runs across the room with it. hok can see the rolling gong. he opens up on it. the vicious cacophony of machine gun fire is joined by the musical reports of bullets hitting the gong and ricocheting away. very, very noisy. behind the gong, indy gauges his move. as the gong is about to be stopped by a marble bench, indy talks a long stride onto the bench and dives through the glass of the high window. hok's bullets hit the wall.}
