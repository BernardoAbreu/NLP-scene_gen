<L>__{interior charlie's apartment night}
<A>__{still dressed from the banquet, charlie comes through the front door. he removes his coat, and tosses it across the sofa.}
<B>__{charlie walks down the hallway}
<A>__{rubbing the exhaustion from his face. at the bedroom door, he flips the light switch. the scallop shell lamp casts it's mournful glow across the empty bed. charlie stares wistfully for a moment, then flips the light back off.}
<B>__{in the dimly lit marble bath}
<A>__{charlie lays back in the foamy bubbles in the tub. lifting a cigar to his mouth, he strikes a match and lights it. he inhales deeply, holds the smoke for a moment, then expels it suddenly. he tosses the cigar into the toilet, where it sizzles and dies. he reaches over and flushes the toilet, then lays back into the bubbles, deep in thought.}
