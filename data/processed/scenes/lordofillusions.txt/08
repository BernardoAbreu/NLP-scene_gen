<A>__{a place of nightmares. hanging from the middle of the ceiling is another grotesque sculpture, three times the bulk of a large man, and made of metal, fly blown animal parts and knotted rope. it is vaguely cruciform, but its swaying, creaking bulk is not even faintly christian. it is a perverse, sickening image, evoking insanity and agony. from the shadows in the corner, we hear a young girl's soft}

<C>__{nix}
<D>__{hush...}
<A>__{nix goes to the girl. she is twelve; beautiful, blonde, and presently in a state of mortal fear. she sits, bound, in a fetal position, her face soaked with sweat and tears, her mouth bloodied, her cheek bruised.}
<C>__{nix}
<D>__{i said hush.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{please. let me go.}
<A>__{from the opposite corner the screech of nix's pet baboon. nix goes to it. the animal is large and lethal.}
<C>__{nix}
<P>__{(to baboon)}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{the baboon pulls on its chain, staring at the girl and baring its teeth as it screeches.}

<P>__{(to girl)}
<D>__{i think he's in love.}
<A>__{he unshackles the baboon. the animal pads toward the girl, trailing its chain.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{keep it away from me.}
<A>__{nix catches hold of its chain. holds it back. the baboon starts screeching again, scrabbling at the girl, its nails catching her arms and legs, drawing blood.}

<D>__{please... please...}
<A>__{nix watches her terror dispassionately.}
<C>__{butterfield}

<C>__{nix}
<D>__{you don't like him, do you?}
<C>__{butterfield}
<D>__{he wants your magic.}
<C>__{nix}
<D>__{maybe. go fetch him.}
