<A>__{she works the fluorescent stains. makes notes. kimble helps load the next sample.}

<D>__{half the people in the study were indigents. no follow up, no baseline on them. who could say they didn't come into the study with bad livers?}

<D>__{the one on the right is one of the samples you sent me. it shows a lot of perriportal inflammation loaded with eosinophils. when you see that with the accumulation of bile it's a classic for }

<D>__{i'm impressed. now look at this.}
<A>__{she positions a second slide.}
<C>__{wahlund}
<D>__{according to the study, this is a slice from the same liver.}

<A>__{she yields the microscope to kimble.}
<C>__{wahlund}
<D>__{see this small area of bile duct proliferation? von meyenberg's complex. occurs in only 2% of the population. but it's in every one of your five samples.}
<A>__{kimble looks up.}
<C>__{kimble}
<D>__{that's statistically impossible.}
<C>__{wahlund}
<D>__{that's because they're all from the same liver.}
<A>__{she smiles at kimble.}
