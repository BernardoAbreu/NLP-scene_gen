<L>__{exterior woods night}
<A>__{drew pauses long enough to listen for zowie... nothing until a faint cry drifts back at him.}
<B>__{deeper in the woods}
<A>__{zowie limps into frame. blood is flowing from the bullet wound in his left hindquarter, trailing from his suspended leg. every step is a strain.}
<B>__{drew}
<A>__{comes upon a break in the trees. the hanging moon outlines the knoll stretching beyond. and then, the strained breathing, the hushed whimper. drew hesitantly approaches the crest of the knoll. zowie is just beyond, lying on his side at the end of the bloody trail. his chest rises and falls almost imperceptibly with every effort to survive. drew drops to his knees at zowie's side and cradles the dog in his lap, shaking his head in denial. zowie's weak eyes shift, gazing longingly at drew. drew strokes the fur under zowie's chin, hardly able to see the dog through his glaze of tears. zowie's eyes drift off. his chest falls and doesn't rise again. he falls limp in drew's arms. drew hugs zowie even tighter and he begins to weep.}
<B>__{from a distance}
<A>__{we see the image of drew with the dog cradled in his arms, silhouetted against the moonlit horizon.}
