<L>__{exterior dickie's house, mongibello. afternoon.}
<A>__{ripley appears, with his meagre luggage at dickie's front door. he's carrying his tote bag under his arm, the bottom of which seems to be unstitched and held together only by his fingers. marge is on the terrace, she looks down to see tom talking with dickie.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{hi tom.}
<C>__{dickie}
<P>__{(looks up)}
<D>__{marge, ripley's saying goodbye.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{i will come down.}
<C>__{dickie}
<P>__{(to ripley)}
<D>__{did you speak to my father?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{you were right about the telephones. there are no lines, there's some problem.}
<C>__{marge}
<P>__{(coming out of the front door)}
<D>__{hello tom. you're off? what are your plans?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{back, i suppose, slowly as i can.}
<A>__{he goes to shake her hand and as he releases the tote bag the seam splits and records spill to the ground, scattering. he bends down, starts gathering them up. marge helps.}
<C>__{ripley }
<D>__{oh, damn, sorry, this bag's }
<A>__{dickie's delighted when he sees the jazz titles.}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{you like jazz!}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(gathering up the records)}
<D>__{i love jazz.}
<C>__{dickie}
<P>__{(holding up a chet baker)}
<D>__{this is the best. marge says she likes jazz, but she things glenn miller is jazz.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{i never said that!}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{bird. that's jazz.}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{bird! ask me the name of my sailboat }
<C>__{ripley}
