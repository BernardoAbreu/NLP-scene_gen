<D>__{listen. esther, you seem like a nice girl, so i'm only gonna say this once. i no longer affiliate myself with that organization. the politics there were brutal. besides, i've already got a full case load.}
<A>__{esther looks down at his desk. we cut to a shot of the hammer's in out box. both are completely empty, and thickly coated with spiderwebs. the hammer takes notice of her expression of skepticism.}
