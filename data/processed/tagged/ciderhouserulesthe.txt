<A>__{homer makes his way up the hill toward the orphanage. music over.}
<L>__{exterior orphanage early morning}
<A>__{edna is breaking up fights; this time, instead of fighting over snowballs, the orphans are fighting over their pumpkins. suddenly homer tops the brow of the hill and they all see him. buster is the first to catch sight of homer; he runs toward him. mary agnes also sees homer; she immediately turns away and runs inside. music fades out over.}
<L>__{interior lavatory early morning}
<A>__{mary agnes crashes into the bathroom and stumbles up to the mirror; she starts to fix herself up with shaking hands.}
<L>__{interior orphanage, front hall early morning}
<A>__{everyone has heard the news; they come on the run. the children flock around homer, hugging him. homer takes angela and edna in his arms. mary agnes joins the group. homer takes in how changed, how attractive she is. they smile awkwardly at each other.}
<L>__{interior boys' division evening}
<A>__{homer's suitcase is open on the bed; we see homer's hands as he begins to unpack. smaller hands reach in and root through the clothes.}
<C>__{curly }
<D>__{did you bring something for me?}
<A>__{curly continues his search. homer thinks for a second; then reaches into his pocket and pulls out the piece of pale green glass.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{you know what? i did.}
<A>__{homer hands the piece of glass to curly.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{it's from the ocean. it's for you.}
<A>__{curly is duly impressed; he walks away to examine his new treasure. homer continues unpacking. he pulls his x ray out and puts it aside.}
<C>__{buster}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<A>__{homer turns to see buster, mary agnes, angela, and edna in the doorway.}
<C>__{mary agnes}
<D>__{we made up a room for you.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{wouldn't you be more comfortable by yourself?}
<A>__{homer smiles; he nods. angela and mary agnes start to put homer's things back in his bag. edna picks up the x ray and looks at it with a somber expression.}
<C>__{edna}
<D>__{homer, do you know what this is?}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{sure. it's my heart.}
<C>__{angela}
<P>__{(shakes her head)}
<D>__{actually, it's fuzzy's. there's nothing wrong with your heart.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{fuzzy's?!}
<C>__{edna}
<D>__{dr. larch wanted to keep you out of the war, homer that's why he did it. that's why he told you it was yours.}
<A>__{homer is stunned; he puts his hand to his heart.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{i think he worried about his own heart. he said it would never stand up to homer wells going off to war.}
<A>__{homer takes that in; he nods. mary agnes touches him sympathetically.}
<L>__{interior larch's office night}
<A>__{homer looks at his fake diplomas; they are now framed and hanging on the office wall. homer surveys the office, as if for the first time; he sits down in the desk chair, as if slowly getting used to his new position.}
<L>__{interior boys' division night}
<A>__{homer reads to the boys from "david copperfield". while his voice is strong positive, optimistic, certainly reassuring to the boys there is in the conclusion of the chapter something that distracts him. he seems to hesitate; he misses a line or two, and perhaps he purposely skips one or two others. (possibly homer's eyes wander ahead, to the title of the next chapter: "i make another beginning.")}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{"thus i began my new life, in a new name, and with everything new about me... i felt... like one in a dream... the remembrance of that life is fraught with so much... want of hope... whether it lasted for a year, or more, or less, i do not know. i only know that it was, and ceased to be; and... there i leave it."}
<A>__{homer stops and looks at the boys' faces.}
<C>__{curly}
<D>__{what happens next?}
<A>__{homer smiles.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{that's tomorrow, curly. let's mot give the story away.}
<A>__{homer puts out the lights and leaves the boys in the familiar semi darkness. seconds, later, the closed door to the hall is flung open, flooding the room with light from the hall, and homer, dressed in his long white laboratory coat and looking every inch the doctor, delivers his best imitation of larch's popular blessing.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{good night, you princes of maine! you kings of new england!}
<A>__{on copperfield and steerforth and curly as the door to the hall is closed and semi darkness prevails in the room again. copperfield, smiling, shuts his eyes. after a second, the wide eyed steerforth shuts his eyes, too. then curly. the last to close his eyes is buster.}
