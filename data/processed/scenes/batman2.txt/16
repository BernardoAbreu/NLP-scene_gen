<A>__{the robbers give each other a big thumbs up. they're almost halfway across the lake now and the batmobile is disabled. all at once they hear a strange whistling overhead... fireworks? no, it's a thermite bomb rocketing past them, hitting the ice some forty feet ahead and exploding gaudily. jagged chunks of ice break free and shift in the frigid water and the robbers are skidding into the drink before they know what's hit them. angle on snowmobile #5 moving the last of the robbers is santa claus his big sack filled not with toys, but precious stones. he approaches the edge of the park, negotiating his way through a maze of rocky outcroppings. he squirts out from behind a boulder into a clearing... ...and gasps in panic as a searing burst of flame erupts behind him. the batmobile speeds out from the other side of the boulder; santa twists his accelerator, desperately trying to build up speed. as it is, he's barely managing to stay ahead of the flamethrower. but the jet of flame suddenly dies; the hood of the batmobile rises half a foot and twin projectiles launch into the air. a heavy net is strung between them and it lands smack on top of santa claus, entangling the snowmobile and stopping him in his tracks. immobilized, he watches through the net in horror as the batmobile barrels down. when the great black machine is almost atop him it stops on a dime six inches from his heavily padded frame.}
