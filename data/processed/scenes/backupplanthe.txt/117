<L>__{interior zoe's apartment morning}
<A>__{zoe and nuts lie on the pillow together. zoe scratches behind his ears.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{guess it's just you and me again.}
<A>__{nuts licks her face. she gets out of bed and goes to check her belly in the mirror. it's actually getting kind of huge.}
<L>__{exterior zoe's brownstone day}
<A>__{zoe walks down the steps. stan is waiting for her on the sidewalk. his hands in his pockets.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{what.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{it's thursday. we have a doctor's appointment.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{there is no "we", stan.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{come on, i didn't mean to say it, and that's not how i feel.}
<A>__{zoe shakes her head.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i made a mistake trusting you.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{don't say that. that's not true.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{you're not good for me. you made me think i needed you, and i don't.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{so that's it? because of one stupid, asinine thing that i said, it's all over? this is how it ends?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{yes. this is how it ends.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{i don't know why you're so surprised. i told you, nothing lasts forever.}
<A>__{zoe gives him a matter of fact shrug and walks off.}
