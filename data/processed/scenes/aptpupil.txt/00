<T>__{fade in:}
<A>__{through the window of a moving vehicle, we see a series of small, middle class houses. this could be any suburban street in america.}
<L>__{interior city bus day}
<A>__{a boy is seated near the back of a moving bus. this is todd bowden, 15, as all american as they come. he stares out at the other passengers indifferently. then something catches his eye.}
<L>__{exterior residential street santo donato day}
<A>__{title: santo donato, ca february 1984 todd pedals his bike down a quiet street and pulls up to an unassuming bungalow set far back on its lot. this is the kind of house one would hardly notice driving through the peaceful suburban community of santo donato. todd gets off his bike and heads up the front steps. on the way, he bends down to pick up the l.a. times. two signs, in laminated plastic, are secured neatly above the door bell. the first reads: "arthur denker". the second reads: "no solicitors, no peddlers, no salesmen". todd rings the bell. nothing. he looks at his watch. it is twelve past ten. he rings again, this time longer. still nothing. finally, todd leans on the tiny button, staring at his watch as he does so. after more than a minute of solid ringing, a voice is heard from within.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{all right. all right. i'm coming. let it go!}
<A>__{todd lets go as a chain behind the heavy door starts to rattle. then it opens. an old man stands behind the screen. he is kurt dussander, a.k.a. arthur denker. mid seventies. standing there in his bathrobe and slippers, a cigarette smashed in his mouth, he looks like a cross between boris karloff and albert einstein. dussander stares at todd, who tries to speak, but suddenly cannot.}

<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{a boy. i don't need anything, boy. can't you read? i thought all american boys could read. don't be a nuisance, now. good day.}
<A>__{the door begins to close. todd waits till the last moment before speaking.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{don't forget your paper, mr. dussander.}
<A>__{the door stops. dussander opens it slowly. he unlatches the screen and slips his fingers around the paper. todd does not let go.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{give me my newspaper.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{sure thing, mr. dussander.}
<A>__{dussander snatches the paper away and closes the screen door. quickly, almost imperceptibly, the old man's eyes survey the area: across the street, up and down the sidewalk, the boy's bicycle.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{my name is denker. see?}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{denker. perhaps you cannot read after all. what a pity. good day.}
<A>__{as the front door closes, todd speaks rapidly into the narrowing gap.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{bergen belsen, january '43 to june '43. auschwitz, june '43 to june '44. then you went to patin.}
<A>__{the door stops, still partly open.}
<C>__{todd }
<D>__{after the war, you escaped to buenos aires. from 1950 to '52 you were in cuba, and then... from 1952 to '58... i don't know. no one does. but in 1965, you popped up in west berlin, where they almost got you.}
<A>__{the door opens wider.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{listen, boy. i don't know what is the matter with you. but i don't have time for this game. now, get out of here before i call the police.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{call them if you want.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{fine.}
<A>__{the heavy door slams shut.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{it's okay by me herr kommandant. i'm sure the police would love to meet the "blood fiend of patin."}
<A>__{in a flash the front door is open, so is the screen. dussander is through the doorway and descending upon todd with the rolled umbrella raised to strike him. todd stumbles back against the porch rail.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{you get away from this house, god damn you! i will beat you all the way home.}
<A>__{but todd regains his composure quickly. he brushes himself off and levels his eyes at the old man who now hardly seems the threat he was a few seconds ago.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{after 1965, no one saw you again... until i did. three weeks ago on the downtown bus. if you want to call the cops, go right ahead. i'ii wait on the steps.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{you'll do no such thing.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i won't? listen, old man, if i want to start screaming right here, i will. if i want to ride down to the police station and bring the cops back myself, then i will. i will do what ever i want. do you understand?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{but if you like, i could come in for a minute. we could talk.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{i'd be out of my mind to let an insane boy like you into my home.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{is that what you want, to come into my home? so be it. there is no arguing with crazy people.}
<A>__{dussander turns and steps back through the screen door. he stops at the threshold of the house and turns. he is holding the screen door open with one leg, the front door open with the other. he looks straight ahead. a moment later, todd steps into the house.}
