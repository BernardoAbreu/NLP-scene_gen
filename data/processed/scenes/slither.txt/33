<L>__{exterior grant garage night}
<A>__{starla pulls into the driveway. she presses the button on her garage door opener. the door shudders but stays closed. starla's confused. she gets out of the car and examines the door. she looks down and sees a new padlock, locking the door to the cement driveway with bolts on both sides.}
<L>__{interior grant foyer moments later}
<A>__{starla enters the house. she heads toward a door along the wall that leads to the garage. there's a shiny new lock on that door as well. she touches it, baffled. she turns to see grant standing at the end of the foyer. he's in shadows, a little spooky in the darkness.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{welcome home.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{grant? why are there did you put locks on the garage?}
<A>__{pause. no answer.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{you drilled into the driveway.}
<A>__{grant walks into the light.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{yeahhhh. i'm sorry. i just got so excited about... your present.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{my present?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{you're my princess, aren't you?}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{i got a super special birthday present for you this year. i couldn't risk you finding it, so i had to put them locks on the doors.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{all right... i have to clean up before dinner.}
<A>__{grant smiles at her. starla confused, tries to smile back, then turns and heads up the stairs. grant watches starla's fine form from behind, somewhat lustily. but his leering gaze gradually turns into something darker, and he has a realization.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{you're meat.}
<A>__{starla turns.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{grant snaps himself out of it.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{oh, nothin'. nothin'. see you in a sec.}
<A>__{starla smiles uneasily, and heads on upstairs.}
