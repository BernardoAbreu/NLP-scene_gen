<L>__{exterior american express, naples. day.}
<A>__{ripley and dickie are walking out of the american express office, dickie pushing the rest of his money into his case, ripley despondent reading aloud extracts from a letter from herbert greenleaf }
<D>__{ripley ...the thousand dollars, of course, was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing dickie home. naturally, i hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way...}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{you can't blame him. you could hardly expect this to go on forever.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i thought you might write again. now that we're brothers...}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{i can't, how can i, in all decency? we've had a good run, haven't we?}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(increasingly miserable)}
<D>__{what about venice? can we stick to that plan at least?}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{i don't think so, tom. you can't stay on here without money. it's time we all moved on. besides i'm sick of mongi. especially now with everything i really want to move to the north. i need to check out san remo next week, find somewhere new to keep the boat. but it would be great, though, if you came with me. our last trip before you leave. there's a jazz festival we could say goodbye in style. what do you think? a last trip?}
