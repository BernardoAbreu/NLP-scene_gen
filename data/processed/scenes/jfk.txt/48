<A>__{jim in court with a series of drawings indicating with arrows entry and exit wounds to kennedy's neck and head. dr. finck is on the stand, erect, very precise, and irritated.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{colonel finck, are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck?}
<C>__{finck}
<D>__{i was told that the family wanted examination of the head.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{as a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?}
<C>__{finck}
<D>__{i had the cause of death.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{your honor, i would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question. why did colonel finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck?}
<C>__{finck}
<D>__{well i heard dr. humes stating that he said...}
<A>__{flashback to: bethesda autopsy room.}
<C>__{humes}
<D>__{who's in charge here?}
<C>__{army general}
<D>__{i am.}
<C>__{finck }
<D>__{i don't remember his name. you must understand it was quite crowded, and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the president who is dead, you don't look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{but you were a qualified pathologist. was this army general a qualified pathologist?}
<C>__{finck }
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{but you took his orders. he was directing the autopsy.}
<C>__{finck }
<D>__{no, because there were others. there were admirals.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{there were admirals.}
<C>__{finck }
<D>__{oh yes, there were admirals and when you are a lieutenant colonel in the army you just follow orders, and at the end of the autopsy we were specifically told as i recall it was admiral kenney, the surgeon general of the navy we were specifically told not to discuss the case.}
<C>__{kenney}
<P>__{(in bethesda scene)}
<D>__{gentlemen, what you've seen in this room is intensely private to the kennedy family and it is not our business to...}

<D>__{president johnson ordered the blood soaked limousine filled with bullet holes and clues to be immediately washed and rebuilt, 4) sent john connally's bloody suit right to the cleaners, and 5) when my office finally got a court order to examine president kennedy's brain in the national archives in the hopes of finding from what direction the bullets came, we were told by the government the president's brain had disappeared!}
<A>__{there's a pause, and then a murmur from the court. jim is on a roll and knows it. the faces in the courtroom are with him, absorbed, horrified. the law students are still there, they have been since day one. but it is liz's interest that touches him the most.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{so what really happened that day? let's just for a moment speculate, shall we? we have the epileptic seizure around 12:15 p.m.... distracting the police, making it easier for the shooters to move into their places. the epileptic later vanished, never checking into the hospital. the a team gets on the 6th floor of the book depository...}
<A>__{flashback to: the book depository, 1963. a shooter and two spotters dressed as working men move into the oswald spot. one spotter produces the mannlicher carcano.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{they were refurbishing the floors in the depository that week, which allowed unknown workmen in and out of the building. the men move quickly into position just minutes before the shooting.}
<A>__{the camera takes the shooter's point of view: we see down the street through a scope. his spotter wears a radio earpiece. the second spotter is working out of the southeast window.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{the second spotter is probably calling all the shots on a radio to the two other teams. he as the best overall view "the god spot".}

<A>__{at the picket fence a shooter in a dallas police uniform moves into place, aiming up elm street. his spotter has a radio to his ear. another man in a secret service suit moves further down the fence.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{the third team, the c team, moves in behind the picket fence above the grassy knoll, where the shooter and the spotter are first seen by the late lee bowers in the watchtower of the railyard. they have the best position of all. kennedy is close and on a flat low trajectory.}
<A>__{part of this team is a coordinator who's flashed security credentials at several people, chasing them out of the parking lot area. an "agent" in tie and suit moves on the underpass, keeping an eye out. in the crowd on elm street, we catch brief glimpses of the umbrella man and the cuban, neither of them watching kennedy, both looking around to their teams. there is a third man, heavyset, in a construction helmet.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{probably two to three more men are down in the crowd on elm... ten to twelve men... three teams, three shooters. the triangulation of fire clay shaw and david ferrie discussed two months before. they've walked the plaza, they know every inch. they've calibrated their sights, practiced on moving targets. they're ready. it's going to be a turkey shoot. kennedy's motorcade makes the turn from main onto houston.}
<A>__{j.f.k. waves and turns in slow motion.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{six witnesses see two gunmen on the sixth floor of the depository moving around. some of them think they're policemen with rifles.}

<D>__{...probably a security agent.}
<A>__{in the dallas county jail, johnny powell is one of many convicts housed on the sixth floor the same height as the men in the book depository. we look across to the depository through cell bars. johnny and various cell mates are watching two men in the sixth floor of the depository.}

<C>__{jim }
<D>__{...they don't shoot him coming up houston, which is the easiest shot for a single shooter in the book depository, but they wait till he gets to the killing zone between three rifles. kennedy makes the final turn from houston onto elm, slowing down to some 11 miles per hour.}
<A>__{all the shooters tighten, taking aim. it's a tense moment.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{the shooters across dealey plaza tighten, taking their aim across their sights... waiting for the radio to say "green green!" or "abort abort!"}
<A>__{the camera is on kennedy waving. a montage follows all the faces in the square that we've introduced in the movie now appear one after the other, watching the killers, the man with the umbrella, the newman family, mary moorman photographing, jean hill, abraham zapruder filming it, s.m. holland, patrolman harkness... intercut : with the zapruder and nix films on j.f.k. in the final seconds coming abreast of the stemmons freeway sign.}
