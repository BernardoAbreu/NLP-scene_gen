<L>__{interior laboratory day}
<A>__{we are looking at a large screen showing an electronically generated three dimensional view of a human brain featuring color coded neurological activity. in a specific section of the image, cells flash from yellow to red... pull back to reveal henry west surrounded by computers, monitors, electronics, and keyboards. dr. miriam kent stands before a peculiar diagnostic machine scrutinizing data and images. both wear garb favored by surgeons or microchip assemblers. the impressive, weird computer system hums as it shifts programs, the unusual brain image changing colors. through a large window, we see into an adjoining room within which a human figure hangs suspended in mid air by a series of cables designed to simulate flotation. at the console, miriam uses a pen to hit specific areas of the touch sensitive screen, changing the complex chemical symbols displayed there. in the procedure room, a series of pharmaceuticals are injected into an intravenous tube feeding the sleeve arm of the figure. a featherweight cloth mask electronically rises, revealing the sleeping face of catherine. at the console, miriam hits a button and speaks into an intercom microphone.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{sing a song of sixpence...}
<A>__{in the procedure room, there is no reaction from catherine.}
<D>__{miriam (o.s.) (cont'd) sing a song of sixpence...}
<C>__{catherine}
<P>__{(hoarse, groggy)}
<D>__{a pocketful of rye...}
<C>__{miriam }
<D>__{four and twenty blackbirds.}
<A>__{catherine's eyes open.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{baked in a pie...}
<A>__{in the control room, henry hits a switch and catherine is lowered to the pedestal. miriam checks monitors displaying catherine's vital signs and continuing what must be a routine, presses numbers on a keypad to open the pressurized airtight door separating the two areas. in the procedure room, lights come on and miriam eases catherine out of the apparatus. she checks her pupil dilation, pulse, throat, and reflexes. she pokes and prods with a familiarity that would seem rude to an outside observer, but is nothing to them. getting to her feet, we see that catherine's bodysuit is made of an unusual dark fabric almost liquid in consistency. at the console, henry moves to another section and for the first time, we see there are two elaborate neural monitors. and the "brain" pictured here is smaller. younger...}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{"mister e." is doing fine.}
<A>__{reveal a second figure suspended from the ceiling in the procedure room. a small boy is lowered to the pedestal and as miriam records data, catherine removes the child's "mask," displaying the haunted face of edward. clearly, the boy is in some kind of catatonic state.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{did we go sailing?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{almost. mocky lock showed up.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{"mocky lock is the bogeyman, mocky lock wants me where i am."}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{mocky lock is a pain in the ass.}
<A>__{henry communicates with them via the intercom.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{where did that come from again?}
<A>__{catherine looks annoyed how could he forget?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{a nursery rhyme.}
<A>__{catherine detaches the cables and eases edward's frail body into a waiting wheelchair. miriam takes a penlight and examines the boy's eyes... an emotionless void, oddly beautiful.}
<C>__{miriam}
<P>__{(thinking aloud)}
<D>__{nursery rhymes, fairy tales, the bogeyman... all preparation for the horrors of the real world.}
<A>__{making certain the child is comfortable, catherine covers him with a blanket, rests a teddy bear on his lap, and pushes him into the control room, accompanied by miriam. henry types in a command and moves to join them.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{anybody hungry? i'm hungry...}
<A>__{a buzzer sounds and another door hisses open... a constantly fretting administrator, barry cooperman, is waiting for them in the corridor.}
<C>__{cooperman}
<D>__{edward's parents are here.}
<A>__{we can see it in catherine's face this isn't good news.}
