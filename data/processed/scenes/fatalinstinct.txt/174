<L>__{exterior ned's house wide shot near dawn}
<A>__{we move in slowly toward the house.}
<C>__{ned }
<D>__{so... maybe i was wrong. maybe women really are like a big jigsaw puzzle... with pieces that never seem to fit where you want 'em to.}
<L>__{interior ned's house the bedroom same time}
<A>__{ned and laura are in bed, wrapped in each other's arms.}
<C>__{ned }
<D>__{all i know is, there are three things that men can't possibly ever do...}
<A>__{new angle ned and laura revealing that it's not "voice over narration." ned is actually rattling on aloud again.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{...understand women... give birth... and program a vcr. and giving birth is the easy one.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{ned...}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{yeah, laura?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{knock off the chatter, will ya?}
<A>__{he smiles at her. they kiss. romantic saxaphone music begins to play... only this time, it's "laura's theme." the camera pulls back slowly... revealing dizzy laying on the bed beside them... playing the sax. after a beat, laura turns to dizzy.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{we won't need you anymore.}
<A>__{ned casually slips him a twenty dollar bill. dizzy slips off the bed and out the door. laura turns to ned.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{we can make our own music.}
<A>__{her hand reaches slowly over the edge of the bed, toward the floor. suddenly... she comes up with a concertina, a small accordian... and begins to play it! ned lays there listening for a few moments, a stunned look frozen on his face. then... he reaches under the pillow and pulls out a harmonica and joins in. the camera booms up to a high angle shot... as they play medley of all the music heard in the film.}
