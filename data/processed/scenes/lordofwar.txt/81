<A>__{the freighter slips out of the harbor.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{in ukraine since 1992, $32 billion worth of arms have been stolen and re sold. one of the greatest heists of the 20th century.}
<L>__{exterior dockside monrovia. day.}
<A>__{crates of munitions are unloaded from the freighter onto waiting trucks under yuri's supervision.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{the primary market was africa. eleven major conflicts involving 32 countries in the past decade a gunrunner's wet dream.}
<A>__{yuri sizes up the militiamen loading the arms.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{my best customer was self declared president of liberia, andre baptiste. even though we'd met before, i was in no hurry to meet him again. he'd gotten a reputation for routinely hacking off the limbs of those who opposed him. his seven year civil war has been described as "a relentless campaign of sadistic, wanton violence unimaginable to those unfamiliar with the details of man's capacity to visit the abyss." that kind of sums up andy for me.}
<A>__{as the final truck door is secured, a customized lincoln continental convertible comes flying around a corner stereo blaring, deliberately terrorizing the locals on the dock. the car slides to a stop beside yuri. it contains andre baptiste jnr., a handsome young man with sunglasses, a mirror for an earring and a facial tattoo. also in the car, two bodyguards and a pair of liberian teenage girls dressed in dallas cowboy cheerleader uniforms.}
<C>__{andre jnr.}
<D>__{mr. yuri, i am andre baptiste junior. my father would like to meet you.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{thank him but i have other business. a busy schedule.}
<C>__{andre jnr.}
<D>__{it is not optional. my father is easily offended.}
<A>__{yuri ponders for a moment. the machete in the bodyguard's hand makes up his mind.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{what do you know? my schedule just freed up.}
<A>__{a bodyguard takes yuri's suitcase. yuri is barely in the car before it screeches away. as the car roars along the highway on the edge of control, we hear yuri's thoughts.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{but if i thought i was scared of andre senior, i knew i was scared of andre junior. like father, like son. the guava doesn't fall too far from the tree. he was a heavy drinker, a womanizer with a penchant for cheerleaders and a lover of fast american automobiles which he drove recklessly and with total impunity around the streets of the capital. oh yes, he was also a cannibal. they say andre would eat a victim's heart while it was still beating to give him superhuman strength. i could've told him he'd get the same effect from a pastrami sandwich at carnegie's deli.}
<A>__{andre announces his arrival in the main street of monrovia with a burst of gunfire. the city, a violent clash of cultures. goats and gucci.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{monrovia itself was like being on another planet. planet monrovia. from the temperature it was obviously a planet close to the sun. i rarely saw another white man even at my hotel that was soon dubbed the "little kremlin". and i never left town alone. outside town, was the edge of hell. i didn't want to even gaze into it.}
<A>__{the car pulls up to monrovia's premier hotel. a dead body on the ground attracts no attention whatsoever.}
<C>__{andre jnr.}
<D>__{this is your hotel.}
<P>__{(proudly)}
<D>__{two stars.}
<A>__{a porter, carrying yuri's suitcase, steps over the dead body.}
<C>__{andre jnr. }
<P>__{(to yuri)}
<D>__{can you bring me the gun of rambo?}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{part one, two or three?}
<C>__{andre jnr.}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{i have only seen part one.}
<C>__{yuri}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{the m60. you want the attachable grenade launcher?}
<C>__{andre jnr.}
<D>__{please. and the armor piercing bullets.}
<P>__{(revving the car)}
<D>__{i will be back to get you in an hour...or two. it's liberia.}
<P>__{(mischievous smile)}
<D>__{we left a welcoming present in your room.}
<A>__{yuri nods, uncertainly.}
