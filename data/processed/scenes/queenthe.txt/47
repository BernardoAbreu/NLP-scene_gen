<A>__{the queen's face, bristling at the suggestion. (we intercut as necessary)..}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{no member of the royal family will speak publicly about this. it is a private matter and we would all appreciate it if it could be respected as such.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{i see.}
<A>__{tony straightens, taken aback..}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{i don't suppose anyone has had time to think about the funeral yet?}

<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{..their express wish, that it should be a private funeral. with a memorial service to follow in a month, or so.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{tony shoots a look at cherie..}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{given that diana was no longer a member of the royal family we have no choice but to respect their wishes.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{i see.}
<A>__{tony shoots a look at cherie..}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{you don't feel that in view of her high profile and popularity..}
<P>__{(}
<D>__{choosing his words}
<P>__{carefully)}
<D>__{...it might be an idea to pay tribute to her life and achievements?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{or even just to her as a mother?}
<A>__{the queen's face freezes over.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{as i said. that's the spencers' wish.}
<C>__{tony }
<D>__{and the public, ma'am? the british people?}
<A>__{tony hesitates..}
<C>__{tony}

<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{hance to what..?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{to share in the grief?}
<A>__{the queen's face: did she hear right?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{it's a family funeral, mr. blair. not a fairground attraction.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{i think the princess has already paid a high enough price for exposure to the press, don't you?}
<A>__{prince philip enters, dressed and ready for church. he indicates his watch..}
<C>__{elizabeth }
<D>__{now, if there is nothing else i must get on. the children have to be looked after.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{`click', the queen hangs up. tony stares at the receiver.}
<C>__{tony }
<D>__{good bye, your majesty.}
<A>__{he puts down the phone...}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{her instinct is to do nothing. say nothing. and give her a private funeral.}
<C>__{cherie}
<D>__{are you surprised? she hated her guts.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{well, i think it's a mistake.}
<A>__{tony's face becomes dark..}
