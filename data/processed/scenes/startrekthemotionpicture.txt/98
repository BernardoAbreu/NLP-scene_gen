<A>__{moving slowly through the maze of visual's seen from the main viewer.}
<L>__{interior bridge including the viewer (o)}
<A>__{as the cloud obscures all now. everyone gazes at the viewer, almost mesmerized by the shifting violet power field displays.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(staring at viewer, frustrated, awed)}
<D>__{no vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...}
<C>__{spock}

<D>__{captain....!}
<B>__{angle on sulu}
<A>__{sulu peering toward o.s. main viewer, his eyes wide with incredulity.}
<B>__{other reactions}
<A>__{crew peering at o.s. main viewer with expressions of near disbelief. similar reactions as kirk and decker turn too, reacting to: what they see on main viewer (o) (v'ger theme music up) the cloud "aurora" effect rapidly thinning in the "eye of the hurricane" center of the cloud is the object which has stunned the entire bridge crew. rapidly growing in size already frighteningly huge. totally alien in look . its enormous bulk is irrides cent, faintly glowing, suggesting that it is made up of exotic combinations of matter, and energy far beyond the scientific knowledge or ability of earth's 23rd century technology. menacing and yet strangely beautiful, both at the same time.}
<B>__{various angles on the bridge crew and the viewer}
<A>__{the object continues to grow rapidly in size as the enterprise continues moving toward it. everyone is awed; even spock, from whom we discern an involuntary, impressed reaction. decker is with spock at the science console.}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{incredible dimensions , sir! ... i make it as seventy eight kilometers in length ...}
<A>__{all digest the dimensions, as:}
<B>__{angle on the bridge elevator doors}
<A>__{opening to admit mccoy and chekov, whose face and hands are taut with plastiskin applications. seeing the object on the viewer (o.s. at this angle), chekov's eyes open with wide astonishment. he crosses quickly to his weapons defense station, his eyes on the viewer. mccoy, eyes also fixed on the sight, moves to kirk's side.}
<C>__{uhura}
<D>__{it could hold a crew of tens of thousands ...! mccoy or just one thousand, ten miles tall.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{evaluation, mister spock?}
<B>__{across kirk to spock}
<A>__{(this will be the first time we've seen spock dislay ing a definite reaction, almost an emotion.) so engrossed is spock in the main viewer image that he appears not to have heard kirk, whose ad libs a sharp " mr. spock ...!" spock looks absently at kirk an instant, then:}
<C>__{spock}
<P>__{(awed; compelled)}
<D>__{that vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the earth's sun.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(turns to uhura)}
<D>__{transmit image of the alien to starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.}
<C>__{uhura}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
