<C>__{voice }
<D>__{buddy... ya busy?}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{huh whuh?}
<A>__{he opens his eyes and looks stuporously about. buzz is grinning down at him in his little pillbox elevator cap.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{looks like ya nodded off there, buddy! say, ya got a minute?}
<A>__{norville clears his throat.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{oh, uh... buzz... is it important?}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{i like to think so! it's this little idea i been working on!}
<A>__{he turns an easel to face the desk.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{...ya see, i don't intend to be an elevator boy forever! take a look at this sweet baby!}
<A>__{the easel displays an oversized sheet of graph paper. onto it has been rendered a top view, which is a perfect circle, and a side view, which is a vertical line. norville gazes stupidly at the circle.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{...ya get it, buddy? incredibly convenient, isn't it? ya see }
<A>__{he produces a tall glass of lemonade with a straw sitting in it.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{ this is how it works, it's these little ridges on the side that give it its whammy! see, ya don't have to drink like this anymore }
<A>__{he holds his head over the glass to drink from the vertical straw.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{ now you can drink like this }
<A>__{he bends the straw to drink from it at the horizontal.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{...i call it the buzz sucker, get it, buddy? after me! buzz! why, people are just dyin' for a product like this, and the great thing is we won't have to charge an arm and a }
<A>__{norville, who has been stewing, finally barks:}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{wait a minute!}
<A>__{he grabs the lemonade glass, looks at it, sneering.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{...why, this is worthless.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{huh?! but, buddy }
<A>__{norville yanks the straw out and crumples it up.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{this is the most idiotic thing i've ever seen in my life!}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{yeah, but, buddy }
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{nobody wants a hare brained product like this! ya see, buzz, it lacks the creative spark, the unalloyed genius that made, uh...}
<A>__{he pauses to belch.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{...say, the hula hoop such a success.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{but, buddy }
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{and what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! i've got a company to run here }
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{but, buddy, you were }
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{ i can't have every deadbeat on the hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves!}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{geez, i'm sorry, buddy }
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{an example must be made!}
<A>__{buzz looks over his shoulder, turns back to norville.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{wuddya mean, buddy?}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{fired! you're fired! is that plain enough for you, buster!}
<A>__{buzz's jaw drops. his elastic chin strap snaps under the pressure.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{awwww, buddy }
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{and don't call me buddy! out of here! out!}
<A>__{buzz sinks to his knees, weeping. he clutches pathetically at norville's pants legs.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{aw, please, sir this job, it's all i got!}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{get up!}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{i understand if ya don't like the buzz sucker! just lemme keep my job, i'm prayin' to ya!}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{we don't crawl at hudsucker industries! get out of my office! leave your uniform in the locker room!}
<A>__{buzz stumbles away, still weeping.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{i'm sorry, buddy... i'm sorry...}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{buzz... off! ha ha ha ha!}
<A>__{as we track in on norville, laughing, there is a low, unearthly rumble, and his face seems to dissolve into:}
<B>__{flames}
<A>__{we pull back from the flame of sid mussburger's oversized lighter as he finishes lighting a cigar. he is sitting alone in the boardroom, but its door swings open and norville enters wearing plaid knickers, a little cap, and a knit shirt that shows his waist starting to bulge. he has a full golf bag over his shoulder.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{sorry i'm late, sid. that back nine at riverdale is really murder.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{sure, sure, it's a tough course. well thanks for coming, kid. i thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed it seems we're having some security problems here at the hud.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{ya don't say.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{mm. ordinarily i wouldn't bother you with it, but this is embarrassing, kid it seems to concern you directly.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{how's that, sid?}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{it's not important in itself some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him }
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{huh?! he no, i he's just maybe i was a little rough on the boy, ya see i }
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to explain to me. he's a little person. he's nothing. like i say, ordinarily it would just be a nuisance. but it seems well, there was a spy in the company...}
<A>__{he is shoving a file towards norville, who opens it.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{...sure, sure, we tried to kill the story. but her newspaper won't play ball... looks like her story's coming out...}
<A>__{we track down the length of the board room table toward norville, who stares horrified at the file.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{...see, kid, the problem the board'll have... you hired this woman. kept her on, while she made a chump out of you. serious error of judgment... i mean, business is war, kid ya take no prisoners, ya get no second chances. and a boner like this... i'm afraid when the board meets, after new year's, your position... well, it looks like you're finished... stick a fork in ya, you're done... washed up...}
<A>__{we lose mussburger from frame as we tighten further on norville, mussburger continuing off:}
<C>__{mussburger }
<D>__{...i'm sorry, kid. i understand this dolly who betrayed you, she used to be a friend of yours...}
<A>__{norville is slowly dragging the golf cap off his head.}
<C>__{mussburger }
<D>__{...and this elevator dope used to be a friend, too...}
<A>__{norville stares, perfectly still.}
<C>__{mussburger }
<D>__{...well, they've got your throat pretty well slit. and when you're dead, ya stay dead. ya don't believe me, ask waring hudsucker... yeah, looks like curtains. well, condolences, kid...}
<A>__{norville's image turns to: black and white image of norville we pull back to show that it is on the front page of the manhattan argus. the headline, in screaming nine point type: fake! next to the picture of norville is the subhead: idea man a fraud. next to the sub subhead is a picture of buzz in his elevator operator's pillbox hat: stole hoop idea from genius elevator jockey clarence "buzz" gunderson.}
<C>__{amy }
<D>__{you can't print that!}
