<A>__{atwood and her flashlight pass us. three feet to her right and slightly behind is snyder and his flashlight. the two detectives are leaving the living room and entering the hall toward the bedrooms. the ceiling is low here and it feels very claustrophobic. ahead is a door painted red. but before they get to it, there's a room on the right. snyder shines his light in. it's a bathroom. the shower curtain is open. nobody in the tub. the door ahead is waiting, but there's another door on the right. snyder shines his light in. this one is a treatment room with a therapy table and shelves of oils and unguents. they've come to the red door. atwood will open this one. she turns the knob and pushes. the door is stuck. she and snyder exchange a look. snyder shuffles back half a step and flattens himself against the wall. he shuts off his flashlight. atwood takes a deep breath, levers her weight against the door and pushes. there's a sudden snap! then the door swings freely open. the beam of atwood's flashlight reveals a large room containing a bed, a dresser, a... creeekkk!!! the sound is coming from up in the rafters. atwood whips her flashlight in that direction. for an instant the beam catches a piece of a large shape falling fast right at her. then it's lost in the darkness and then picked up again in the reflected light in the hall. the shape is a naked man. whack!! the man nails atwood in the shoulder. bang! her gun goes off. she bounces into the wall and onto her ass. barely slowed the man continues in an upward arc. his feet and knees slam into the ceiling. plaster dust rains. the man swings back, past snyder. he's lost in the darkness again. then he swings back into the light and comes to a stop just inside the bedroom door. the man is hanging from a rope around his neck. he's dead. his body is festooned with syringes stuck into his bare flesh. in fact two of the needles hold a sheet of paper to the man's chest. printed on the paper in big black letters are the words: ha! ha! ha! ha!}
