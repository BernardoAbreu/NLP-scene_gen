<L>__{interior annie's office morning}
<A>__{annie's office is now crowded with a dozen or so employees; sitting on the couch, on the window sills, on the arms of chairs, against the walls... paper bag emptied of bagels, cream cheese, orange juice, paper plates... hand held camera captures the energy of the room as it follows overlapping lines, laughter, etc... yet, no matter how casual it all seems, annie is very much at the center of control... we enter the scene of laughter, as annie asks kevin, a feature writer:}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{... so what did you say to her?}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{i said, thank you very much...}
<P>__{(laughter, ad libs)}
<D>__{i really should do the interview... but perhaps if you'd like to have dinner...}
<A>__{laughter... everyone starts ad libbing...}
<C>__{various characters}
<D>__{dinner!!... he's so cute.... why don't i get those kind of interviews?... look, he has husband number eight written on his forehead...}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{all right, all right, all right... kevin, good job. write the interview. if i don't like it, you may have to sleep with her for a follow up!}
<P>__{(laughter)}
<D>__{now... i'm thinking about another fashion designer spread... who's news out there?}
<A>__{characters shout out designer names and comments as the phone rings and lucy picks up... speaking amdist the talking...}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{hold on.}
<P>__{(presses hold)}
<D>__{gottschalk.}
<A>__{the room goes dead quiet, instantly. then erupts in laughter as everyone realizes it. annie, however, waves her hand as she takes the phone...}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{quiet... quiet!}
<A>__{everyone obeys. annie presses speaker phone.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{david?}
<C>__{david gottschalk }
<D>__{who's there?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{everyone. working overtime. just for you.}
<C>__{david gottschalk }
<D>__{did you speak to farlow?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{yes. we're suing.}
<C>__{david gottschalk }
<D>__{is that absolutely necessary? it'll just make it a bigger story.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{david, he signed an agreement that he wouldn't talk to the press and he's libeled me by saying i faked the figures. you're not going soft on me, are you?}
<A>__{silence. gottschalk doesn't immediately respond. everyone waits. covert looks between characters suggest this is interesting has annie over stepped her bounds with the magazine's owner? annie waits without a shred of anxiety even though she might have some. finally:}
<C>__{david gottschalk }
<D>__{well, i suppose we could use another good public feud...}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{exactly...}
<A>__{everyone silently acknowledges annie guts and influence.}
