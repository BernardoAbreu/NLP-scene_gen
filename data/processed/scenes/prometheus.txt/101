<L>__{interior catacombs underground hangar}
<A>__{a circular chamber of stunning size a thousand feet across. its lofty ceiling flat and segmented, designed to open. watts follows her map into the space in awe. dominating the hangar is a ship: the vast horseshoe shaped vessel familiar from the original film. we will come to know it as the juggernaut. it's at rest on its landing gear. skeletal gangways slanting up to its three massive doors. watts glances at her map: holloway's holographic trace leads right up the gangway into the ship. she goes.}
<C>__{pilot chamber}
<A>__{watts passes through a circular space with a high domed ceiling. a green glow emanates from grooves in the floor. in the center of the chamber: a pilot's chair. a mechanical throne built to giant scale. its seat segmented like an armadillo's back. tubes and conduits poised and waiting for some connection. the chair is empty. above the chair, a massive telescope like apparatus juts into the air, its function unknowable.}
<C>__{navigation chamber}
<A>__{an extraordinary facility. a console, nearly five feet high and broad as a dance floor, dominates the room. four immense coffin like cockpits are built into the console. in each of these a navigator an engineer lies long dead. but the real spectacle is overhead. the orrery: the barrel vaulted ceiling is traced with circular arches of some exotic alloy, as if to trace celestial courses. the air above the console is filled with spheres of light. they are nearly still: but close study reveals them all to be in motion, drifting with the movements of the cosmos. watts stares at the orrery in amazement. somewhere among those heavenly spheres is earth. somewhere perhaps the homeworld of the engineers themselves. a bizarre sound: a section of blank wall suddenly unravels itself, becoming an open door. david walks in, his hand raised in command. he clearly caused the door to open.}

<D>__{david.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{dr. watts. i didn't expect you. do you know what this is?}
<A>__{watts points at the door david just opened.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{how did you do that?}
<A>__{a flicker of disappointment in the android's face. contempt.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{ah. you don't see.}
<P>__{(he smiles)}
<D>__{i call this ship the juggernaut. chariot of the gods.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{this is the navigation computer, for want of a better term. but it's much more than that. it seems to hold the observable universe in its memory.}
<A>__{he gestures in the air: the spheres reconfigure themselves at his command, swarming and zooming. watts stares at david, conflicted: her desire for information warring with the agenda that brought her here.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{their homeworld. do you see where the engineers come from?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{there are safeguards on that data. it's toward the galactic center. sagittarius arm.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{david. the creature that killed martin. there are thousands of them under the pyramid. hatcheries.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{watts}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{those things wiped out the engineers on this moon.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i've succeeded in connecting with the juggernaut's systems, dr. watts. i know a great deal today i didn't know yesterday. i'm on the verge of activating more systems. archives.}
<C>__{watts}
<P>__{(horrified)}
<D>__{you're turning things on? this site should be sealed. evacuated.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{would holloway have walked away from this? there's no greater work i can imagine.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{it's too dangerous.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{only for the ignorant. dr. watts. i've read your file. your intelligence scores are even higher than professor holloway's. but he had a kind of courage. an audacity of imagination. if you could find that in yourself...}
<A>__{watts stares at him, realization growing in her eyes. david is off the reservation.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{if your owner gives you a direct order, you have to obey. don't you?}
<A>__{she's got his attention now. david goes rigid.}
<C>__{watts }
<D>__{i can have vickers pull you out.}
<A>__{david looks at her with something like contempt.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i was given two operating protocols for this mission. i was to render you every assistance until you discovered what vickers would call a "game changing technology." i was given a specific list. then i was to go to protocol two.}
<A>__{there's an edge in his voice that scares her.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{what's protocol two?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{under protocol two i was to make sure that you and holloway never spoke to anyone about this place. various acceptable ways of making sure of that. i was given a list.}
<A>__{watts loses her nerve. she heads for the door.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{you're all so stupid.}
<A>__{the door begins to knit itself closed in front of her. watts gasps in shock at the malice in david's voice as much as the closing door. she dives out. just in time.}
<C>__{vaulted passage}
<A>__{watts runs. behind her, the door bursts open again. with superhuman speed, david comes after her. he runs like a demon, his legs steel pistons. caroming off of walls. he closes the distance in seconds. slaps watts against the wall, shattering her helmet's visor. she falls, dazed.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{stupid and slow.}
