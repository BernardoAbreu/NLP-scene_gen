<L>__{interior apartment kitchen later}
<A>__{white downs a cup of black coffee, staring blankly out the window. o.s. distant screams. he glances across to a wall, notices a fly there something about it looks wrong. fly's p.o.v. a distorted electronic image of white's face looming up. at exactly that moment the fly takes off, flies erratically down the hall, around a turn and disappears. white follows. hall way white moves quietly towards the bedroom door.}
<B>__{his p.o.v.}
<A>__{it is ajar, dark inside. movement. the women are naked on the bed. the japanese woman has her eyes shut, head back in ecstasy. the wife is bent over her, kissing her stomach. angle on white watching through the crack in the door. the women are oblivious. he moves away slowly, feeling strange. his feet stop making contact with the floor. he grabs a table to steady himself. the table cloth comes away, things spill to the floor and smash. he's floating. white desperately reaches out to grab something, holds the light fixture in the ceiling. it breaks off in a cloud of plaster. sparks briefly illuminate. he falls heavily onto the ceiling now the floor. the apartment is upside down. he stares up at furniture and objects.}
<B>__{the bathroom}
<A>__{white steps into the room, eerily illuminated by a glowing heater stuck to the floor. water is running filling the tub and overflowing, making a suspended puddle above white's head. white takes off his clothes and climbs the wall, towards the floor. it's difficult, but he reaches the tap, turns it off. pulls himself towards the tub. gravity becomes normal again as he sinks in the warm water. he's incredibly weak floats limply in the bath. submerges his face. a distant throbbing o.s., like a huge machine heart somewhere in the building. he opens his eyes, still underwater, stares up at the ceiling.}
<B>__{his p.o.v.}
<A>__{a blurry dark figure moves into his vision. it stares down at him. white rigid with fright, cannot focus on the figure through the thin veil of water. the figure reaches out. a gloved hand grabs white about the throat, holds him forcefully. white gulps for air, swallows water. his eyes widen. he tries to stop the hand strangling him but can't. suddenly the hand pulls away. the blurry figure stumbles back and erupts into bloody explosion. the body splits apart, throwing internal organs through the room. white awakens in the bathtub. he looks about the room. empty. silent. he gets out of the water, starts to dress.}
