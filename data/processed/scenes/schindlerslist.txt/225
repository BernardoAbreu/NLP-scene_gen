<L>__{interior clinic later day}
<A>__{in a quiet corner of the clinic, schindler concentrates on the disquieting news stern has brought him:}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{we've received a complaint from the armaments board. a very angry complainterior the artillery shells, the tank shells, rocket casings apparently all of them have failed quality control tests.}
<A>__{schindler nods soberly. then dismisses the problem with a shrug.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{well, that's to be expected. they have to understand. these are start up problems. this isn't pots and pans, this is a precise business. i will write them a letter.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{they're withholding payment.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{well, sure. so would i. so would you. i wouldn't worry about it. we'll get it right one of these days.}
<A>__{but stern is worried about it.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{there's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines.}
<P>__{(schindler doesn't deny it)}
<D>__{i don't think that's a good idea.}
<C>__{schindler}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{no?}
<A>__{stern slowly shakes his head 'no.'}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{they could close us down.}
<A>__{schindler eventually nods, in agreement it seems.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{all right. call around, find out where we can buy shells and buy them. we'll pass them off as ours.}
<A>__{stern's not sure he sees the logic. whether the shells are manufactured here or elsewhere, they'll still eventually reach their intended destination, into the hearts and heads of germany's enemies.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{i know what you're saying, but i don't see the difference.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{you don't? i do. i see a difference.}
<C>__{stern}
<D>__{you'll lose money. that's one difference.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{fewer shells will be made.}
<A>__{that's another difference. the main one. the only one schindler cares about. silence. then:}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{stern, if this factory ever produces a shell that can actually be fired... i will be very unhappy.}
