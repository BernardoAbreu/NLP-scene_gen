<C>__{walter}
<D>__{why wouldn't they appeal it?}
<C>__{mr. shah}
<D>__{fear of being deported. it used to be that when your asylum case was denied, they let you go until your appeal. a lot of people didn't bother with it. getting denied once was enough to spook them.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{so what happens if that's the case?}
<C>__{mr. shah}
<D>__{then there may be a final order of deportation on him which means he won't even go before a judge this time. he'll just be deported.}
