<D>__{so, congressman, welcome to the honey pot. you should be one happy freshman.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{yeah? well, i'm not. i'm suspicious. one thing i've learned is, when somebody gives you something for nothing, the nothing ain't nothing. it's something. what is it? why me?}
<A>__{reinhardt puts his hand on tommy's shoulders.}
<C>__{reinhardt}
<D>__{congressman, i don't want you to take this the wrong way, but... you're black. and i mean that in the nicest possible way.}
