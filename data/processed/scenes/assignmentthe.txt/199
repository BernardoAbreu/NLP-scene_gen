<L>__{exterior mansion courtyard}
<A>__{it's a dark night, and only a few dim lights illuminate the rather large back yard.}
<B>__{on carlos}
<A>__{landing in a bed of flowers, he rolls, and is quickly on his feet with the machine pistol in hand.}
<B>__{on two armed kgb}
<A>__{securing the courtyard, they rush to the spot where, apparently, they'd seen him land. carlos, however, is no longer there.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{glued to the back of a tree, the jackal cuts them down with one short burst and goes for the kgbs who appear at the broken window. as they take cover, he quickly confiscates a kalashnikov from the dead kgb closest to him and makes it to the high wall which encircles the place. carlos climbs over the wall with the kalashnikov and drops outside the compound to the grass below.}
<B>__{angle on ramirez in the grass}
<A>__{he sees to his horror that carlos is getting away. he is ready to scream, going crazy. he has no gun, he wouldn't stand a chance against carlos, but there is no way he is going to let him get away, no way. he looks around for a rock... anything. there is nothing. carlos turns his back. ramirez sees his chance, he gets up on one knee ready to make his move when suddenly he sees two more kgb guys come running around the wall of the compound.}
<B>__{angle on ramirez}
<A>__{he mouths the words:}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{kill him... kill him...}
<B>__{angle on carlos}
<A>__{he whirls and fires at the two kgbs who fall.}
<B>__{angle on ramirez}
<A>__{he can't believe it. carlos is getting away?}
<B>__{angle on carlos}
<A>__{he suddenly gets a look as if he feels someone's presence. his eyes open wide and he starts to turn when ramirez comes flying out of the darkness and leaps on carlos. the two are dressed exactly alike. carlos is hit from behind and is stunned and drops the assault rifle. ramirez has carlos down and is choking him. carlos looks up at him more shocked than anything else. finally carlos manages to break the grasp and kicks ramirez off. now it is a dazzling display of martial arts. then ramirez charges carlos and tackles him and the two go rolling off into the bushes and darkness. when they roll out of the bushes we have no idea which one is which or who we should be rooting for. just then jack's volga drives up at the side.}
<B>__{angle on the two carloses}
<A>__{they roll over onto the bodies of two dead kgb. there is a kalashnikov on the ground pointed into the carlos on the bottom's side. the carlos who is on top manages to get his finger over to the trigger and pulls it sending a burst into the carlos on the bottom's body. just then the carlos on top looks up and sees jack standing over him with a gun pointed at him ready to shoot. in b.g. we hear cars with sirens approaching. the carlos on top looks over to jack who is ready to shoot him.}
<C>__{carlos on top}
<D>__{don't shoot. it's me you asshole!}
<A>__{jack just stares at him and then lowers his gun.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{let's get the fuck out of here.}
<A>__{he turns around and starts to get into the volga. the carlos on top, whom we just thought was ramirez bends down and reaches for the dead kgb's pistol.}
<B>__{angle on jack}
<A>__{he gets that sixth sense feeling and turns around, his gun raised and pointed at the man whose hand is now on the pistol. is it carlos or ramirez, who is standing there with pistol in hand almost turned to jack but still at a disadvantage in this mexican stand off.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{have you come looking for me now, annibal?}
<C>__{the man with the pistol}
<D>__{what the fuck are you talking about...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{awfully warm for this time of year isn't it?}
<A>__{the man with the pistol knows this is a password of some kind and the look on his face betrays the fact that he doesn't have an answer. jack is just about to shoot him when a burst of machine gun fire is heard from the approaching cars and it rips into the tree next to jack who dives for cover. that act of self preservation gives the man we now realize is the real carlos the chance he needs. with catlike grace he dives, rolls and vanishes into the shadows. he has gotten away and jack has to decide whether to go after his quarry or rescue his friend. he opts for the latter, scoops up annibal and throws him into the volga and speeds off as cars approach from the other side.}
