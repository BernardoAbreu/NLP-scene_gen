<L>__{exterior forest hawkeye day}
<A>__{moves through the trackless forest. uncas is far out on the left flank. cora, alice & duncan heyward follow in hawkeye's and chingachgook's steps ... hawkeye's feet walking through a creek, stepping in the stream bed instead of on stones. the others follow. hawkeye looks at heyward.}
<B>__{heyward}
<A>__{conforms. he's ill at ease not being in command, following the lead of some half indian frontiersman through a foreign wilderness.]}
<C>__{heyward}
<D>__{how far is it, scout?}
<C>__{hawkeye}
<D>__{day and a half}
<P>__{(pause)}

<D>__{colonel munro sent him. he was one of our mohawk allies.}
<C>__{hawkeye}
<D>__{he is huron and nothing else.}
<P>__{(checking the munro girls are not too close)}
<D>__{why would he want to murder the girl?}

<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{hawkeye}
<D>__{dark haired ...}
<C>__{heyward}
<D>__{miss cora munro. he never set eyes on her before today.}
<C>__{hawkeye}
<D>__{no blood vengeance? no re proach or insult?}
<C>__{heyward}
<D>__{of course not!}

<D>__{no. headin' west. to can tuck ee.}
<C>__{heyward}
<D>__{i thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia?}
<A>__{off to the side, uncas smiles at the idea.}
<C>__{hawkeye}
<D>__{i ain't your "scout". and i am in no damn militia.}
<C>__{heyward}
<P>__{(stops)}
<D>__{then you are one of those who would allow england to fight alone while she protects you from france?}
<C>__{hawkeye}
<D>__{england does not protect me and does not war against france on our account. she uses us to war against france on her own account ... of greed for land and furs.}

<C>__{chingachgook}
<P>__{(to hawkeye)}
<D>__{yengeese no good in woods. make more noise, i kill him.}
<A>__{heyward spins. hawkeye coolly watches cora. her attitude is hostile; aligned with heyward. he turns away. meanwhile ...}
<B>__{uncas}
<A>__{stops, alarmed. something in the air bothers him. hawkeye smells it, too.}
<B>__{chingachgook}
