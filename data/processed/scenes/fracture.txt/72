<C>__{willy}
<D>__{look, i'm sorry i didn't tell you }
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{did you hear me, when i said bob wanted you gone as soon as this thing broke?! did you hear me say i went out on a limb to convince him }
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{wouldn't it be better than damage control if i actually turn it around?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{and what if you don't?}
<A>__{willy has no answer. he doesn't think that way. and she sees that. she sees a young man from oklahoma, in way over his head. desperate to get through:}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{you don't get it at all, do you?! you pulled a stunt to get yourself this job. fine: you're a hot shot!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{wooton sims does not need hot shots. because you don't win. the firm wins. bob wins.}
<C>__{nikki }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and you just put yourself head to head in conflict with bob.}
<A>__{silence. shaken:}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{what am i supposed to do?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{we told the man you're getting on a plane to chicago, tuesday.}
<A>__{painful silence.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{yeah. okay.}
<A>__{nikki watches him dealing with it, sympathetic. the impossible feelings always running under the surface for them have developed a darker, aching tone. if anything, stronger.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i think maybe i'm gonna go now.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{all right.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{call if you want.}
<A>__{he nods. neither one moves. judge gardner enters cautiously from the dining room breaking the spell. nikki nods goodbye to willy, and goes out quickly without meeting her father's eye. awkward pause.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i've got some work to do. i need to call a cab.}
<A>__{gardner nods respectfully, but doesn't move quite yet. studying the torn up young man.}
<C>__{gardner}
<D>__{you know what nobody understands about certain kinds of underpaid public service work? now and then you get to put a fucking stake in a bad guy's heart. we're not supposed to talk about that when we visit a third grade class on career day, and it doesn't get you very far into the country club locker room but it's hard to beat when you actually get to do it.}
<A>__{willy looks at the kindly old judge, a little surprised. gardner shrugs: my two cents. he goes to a side table, finds the yellow pages.}
