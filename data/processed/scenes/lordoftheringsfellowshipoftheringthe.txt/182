<L>__{exterior ford of bruinen day}
<A>__{crane down: as the white horse races towards camera, to reveal the wide river bruinen in the foreground. without hesitation, the white horse leaps into the shallow water and thunders across the ford. the 9 ringwraiths pull up short of the ford, clearly nervous of the water. the white horse reaches the other side...arwen pulls up and turns to defiantly face the ringwraiths from across the ford.}

<D>__{give up the halfling, she elf! she draws her sword and yells at the witch king.}

<D>__{if you want him, come and claim him.}
<A>__{the witch king screeches angrily, draws his sword, and leads the ringwraiths across the ford. the water starts flowing faster...a distant rumble can be heard. arwen waits until they are halfway across: she suddenly stands in the saddle arms raised!}

<A>__{the ground suddenly trembles...a mighty roar fills the air! frodo looks up weakly...to see a vast torrent of water flooding down the river towards the ford...as if a dam had burst! the foaming water seems to form the shape of dancing white horses with frothing manes! the ringwraiths scream in terror as they are swallowed up in the deluge. their piercing cries are drowned in the roaring of the river as it carries them away! close on: frodo as he loses consciousness...}
<C>__{arwen}
<P>__{(upset)}
<D>__{no, no...frodo, no! frodo, don't give in...not now!}
<A>__{arwen gathers the small hobbit in her arms, feeling his life slip away.}
