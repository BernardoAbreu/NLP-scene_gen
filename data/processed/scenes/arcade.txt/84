<L>__{exterior level four, volcano day}
<A>__{we are looking at a steep cliff face composed of black, volcanic rock. this world is desaturated, gray, and harsh. the rocks looks sharp as razors. as we will discover, the cliff face is also composed of skulls, old and blackened, set inside the rock. we hear a humming and alex "fades in", appearing on the side of the cliff face. immediately she starts to fall, realizes where she is, and hugs the cliff for dear life. rock shards crumble away beneath her feet. alex looks down ... big mistake. she hugs the cliff face tighter, tears and grime streaking her face. she's alone now and she knows it. she looks up ... it's a long way to go. alex reaches a hand upward. ouch! the rock's hot. she jerks her hand back and almost loses her perch.}
<B>__{her hand}
<A>__{her gloves are smoking and singed. alex starts to cry freely now. she reaches inside her chestplate, fumbling, and pulls something out... it's the polaroid of her and greg. but then the wind catches it and tears it from her hand.}
<B>__{the polaroid}
<A>__{twists downward, round and round into infinity. alex stares after it a moment. then she lets out a tired little laugh and starts to climb.}
<B>__{a series of dissolves...}
<A>__{as alex climbs, sometimes using a skull itself as a hand or foothold. we see her "time elapsed" blocks blinking away. time running out and more climbing. then...}
