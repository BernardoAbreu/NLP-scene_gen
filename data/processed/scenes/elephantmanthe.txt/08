<T>__{cut to another hallway:}
<A>__{somewhere a door is opened and the squeak sounds vaguely like the trumpeting of an elephant. we hear again the metallic footfalls of the night porter's boots, and he appears. he goes to the narrow stairway marked, "isolation". he stops and casually looks about. he takes a swig of his gin, then starts up the stairs.}
<B>__{attic ward}
<A>__{merrick as before the light is very dim. we hear the echoing footfalls of the night porter coming up the stairs. merrick's head immediately comes up from his knees. as it does, a small object falls from where his head rested. he picks it up and puts it in a pocket of his cloak. it is the portrait of the beautiful woman, which he saw in his dream. suddenly the door swings open and the night porter, bottle in hand, is standing there. he walks into the room and sees merrick's shape on the bed.}
<C>__{night porter}
<D>__{here he is, the old fiend of the night, the terror of the london. let's have a look at you. let's see what makes 'em scream...}
<A>__{he turns up the light and sees merrick clearly. the night porter jumps back, awe struck.}
<C>__{night porter}
<D>__{cor blimey!}
<A>__{merrick is trembling. the night porter, hardly able to believe his eyes, moves slowly toward merrick. he is afraid but as he reaches the bed, merrick flinches back. the night porter grins, his fear gone now. he is in control.}
<C>__{night porter}
<D>__{so this is the elephant man. i ain't never seen nothing like you before. what the bleedin' hell happened to you?}
<A>__{merrick cowers as far away from the night porter as possible.}
<C>__{night porter}
<D>__{oh... dumb, eh?}
<A>__{he takes a big swallow of the gin and smiles.}
<C>__{night porter}
<D>__{good. i likes people what can keep quiet.}
<A>__{he offers merrick his bottle with a swift, almost jabbing motion. merrick pulls away from him.}
<C>__{night porter}
<D>__{like a drink? go on... go on have some. no? you should try being more sociable, mate.}
<A>__{he tentatively presses the bottom of the bottle up against the hanging growth on merrick's chest. encouraged, he touches him with his fingers. merrick makes a small whimpering sound.}
<C>__{night porter}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{you and i are going to be good friends, we are. and, i've got lots of friends who i know would like to meet you. and they will, mate... they will.}
<A>__{he moves to the door and turns. close up of night porter's face.}
<C>__{night porter}
<D>__{welcome to the london.}
<A>__{he moves out the door and it closes. in the bed, merrick looks at the door with terror as the heavy footfalls of the night porter recede down the stairs.}
<B>__{whitechapel road}
<A>__{we see a horse's head in cu, snorting steam into the chill morning air. the horse is harnessed to a milk wagon parked in front of the london. through the open back of the wagon we see the milkman, and past him treves, walking towards us.}
<C>__{milkman}
<D>__{here early again, eh mr. treves? if you don't mind my saying so, sir, with your early habits, you'd 'a made a fine milkman.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{good morning, charley. i will keep that in mind!}
<A>__{treves walks up the path into the hospital. hallway (morning) treves, carrying a bowl, crosses the upper hall and starts to the narrow stairway to the isolation ward. over his shoulder we see him knock twice on the door. as the door swings open, the camera pushes past him and we see the room. the lamp is still burning, but merrick is nowhere to be seen. treves enters, looking about for him.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{mr. merrick?}
<A>__{there's movement in the corner beside the bed. merrick rises slightly from the shadow. the light from the lamp hits his frightened eyes.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{....good morning... john. i've brought your breakfast.}
<A>__{treves is unsettled by the sight of merrick cowering down on the floor. merrick begins to babble. treves enters the room, placing the bowl on the table and going to merrick.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{what are you doing down there? come up john, come up on the bed. the cold floor is bad for you. i won't hurt you, come on now...}
<A>__{he helps merrick up onto the bed and goes back to the table for the bowl.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{you must eat. we must keep your strength...}
<A>__{he has turned back to the bed, but merrick has slipped to the floor again, still trying to hide himself in the corner.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{...what on earth is the matter with you?}
<A>__{he puts the bowl down again and goes back to merrick, who seems very upset at leaving his hiding place.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{now please, john, you must do as i say. come up from there.}
<A>__{he starts to help merrick up, but merrick just presses himself farther back in the corner, still babbling. there are two raps at the door. treves goes to it and lets mothershead in.}
<C>__{mothershead}
<D>__{good morning, mr. treves. it'll be his bath time soon. has he eaten?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{not quite yet, mrs. mothershead. there seems to be some difficulty this morning.}
<A>__{they both look at the bed. merrick has almost disappeared under it.}
<C>__{mothershead}
<D>__{won't come out, eh?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{no, he's very upset about something.}
<C>__{mothershead}
<D>__{just being obstinate, sir. i will handle it.}
<A>__{she goes to merrick and takes hold of his left wrist.}
<C>__{mothershead}
<D>__{alright, my son, none of this fuss. come up from there, this instant.}
<A>__{she starts to force him up from the floor. merrick is moaning now, still trying to get away.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{no! don't pull at him like that. we don't want to frighten him more than he already is.}
<A>__{by this time mothershead has almost got him back on the bed.}
<C>__{mothershead}
<D>__{honestly, sir, you must be very firm with this sort. otherwise they'd lay about on the floor gibbering all day long. all he understands is a good smack.}
<A>__{they help merrick settle back on the pillow. merrick is still making desperate, unintelligible sounds.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{he's had his share of "smacks", mothershead. i expect that's what drives him under the bed. we must use patience and understanding with this man.}
<C>__{mothershead}
<D>__{perhaps you've got the time for that, mr. treves, i certainly don't. i've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. i don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? i will be back later for his bath. and mr. carr gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. good day sir.}
<A>__{she exits. treves shuts the door behind her and turns back to the bed.}
<C>__{treves}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{what good am i to you...?}
<A>__{he goes to the bed and sits down in front of merrick, angered by his own seeming uselessness in the situation.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{...what is my purpose? ...it's so important that i understand you. i want to help you, i want to be your doctor...}
<P>__{(directly to merrick)}
<D>__{but i can't help you unless you help me, unless i know what you are feeling. i believe there's something back there, there's something you want to say, but i've got to understand you. do you understand me?}
<A>__{merrick hesitates, then starts babbling again.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{no! you are going to talk to me! we are going to show them! we're going to show them that you're not a wall. we are going to talk! do you understand? nod your head if you understand me!}
<A>__{slowly merrick nods yes.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{you do understand me! you understand. now you're going to say it. i've got to hear how you say things. now, very slowly, say "yes."}
<A>__{treves carefully mouths the word.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{"yes."}
<A>__{merrick is still hesitant, from years of fear, but his eyes betray a growing excitement. slowly, he tries to talk, his voice a tremulous whisper.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{yyyy... yyye... yyyess.}
<C>__{treves}
<P>__{(grabbing merrick's arm)}
<D>__{yes john!}
<A>__{throughout their dialogue, merrick is still very garbled, but he no longer babbles. he makes a great effort to speak slowly, to form words the way treves forms them, to be understood.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{...yyes}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{yyyess.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{yyess.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{that's much better. i could understand that "yes".}
<C>__{merrick}
<P>__{(pleased)}
<D>__{yes!}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{very good! oh yes! now listen. i'm going to say some things to you and i want you to repeat them... um... i want you to say them back to me. do you understand? i'm going to say some things to you and i want you to say them back to me. do you understand?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{excellent! now, say... "hello"}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{hello...}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{my name is...}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{my... name is...}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{john merrick.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{john... merrick}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{say "merrick".}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{merrick...}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{say "mmmerrick."}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{mmmerrick.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{say "mmmerrick."}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{mmmerrick.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{well, that's alright. i understand you. now, say the whole thing again, hello ...}
<C>__{merrick}
<P>__{(haltingly)}
<D>__{hello... my name is... john merrick.}
