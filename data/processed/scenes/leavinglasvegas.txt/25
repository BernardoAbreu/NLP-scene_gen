<D>__{beautiful, no just the shape which is nice, but the whole walk, the feeling, the movement. this girl is pleased with herself. maybe this is the only art i can appreciate... i don't know if this is good or bad, but right now she is really beautiful. when i was a boy it would have been really important that she have a pretty face, to go with this body, i mean. i still would like to see her face, but her beauty is no dependent on her face.}
<A>__{the dog gets interested in something on the sidewalk and she bends down to pull at its collar.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(voice over)}
<D>__{i wonder what kind of panties she's wearing. shit, that's too specific, but... on the other hand, you can never be too specific... but then, the infinitesimal must be, by definition, as infinite as the infinite.}
<A>__{suddenly the girl stops. ben catches up with her and cannot resist looking into her face.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(voice over)}
<D>__{god, she's so young.}
