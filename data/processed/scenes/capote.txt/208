<D>__{dick came to get me and we turned out the lights and went down to the basement, where we had mr. clutter and the boy. dick kept saying "no witnesses." i figured if i just waited him out he'd give up and leave them tied up there. we'd drive all night, they'd never find us. mr. clutter's wrists were tied to a pipe over his head. he looked like he was hurt, so i cut him down.}
