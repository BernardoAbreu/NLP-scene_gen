<A>__{they're all in the room. starks seems pretty calm. only in a c.u. do we see his eyes register the jacket...}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{i'm glad to see you're cooperating this time, mr. starks.}
<A>__{starks looks at the wide, sturdy restraints on it. they would really hurt if you hit someone as hard as you could with them. they might even knock someone out... damon and harding move to undress him, when starks makes a move to do it himself. they look to dr. becker who nods that it's all right. damon begrudgingly lets go of starks but not before he steps on one of starks' bare feet. starks doesn't flinch. he merely turns away from them and bends down to take off his pants. on his way up, he grabs the jacket off its hook and, using it like a weapon, aims to smack it across damon's face. damon deftly ducks and the jacket hits becker instead. the force of the blow sends becker down, and as he falls against the wall, damon and harding leap to restrain starks. becker opens and closes his eyes, trying to get them into focus. his right cheek is cut pretty bad. dr. gries helps becker to his feet and picks his broken glasses up off the floor. becker puts them on.}
<C>__{dr. gries}
<D>__{hold him while i get the tranquilizer.}
<C>__{damon}
<D>__{fuck the tranquilizer! i got a foot.}
<A>__{damon kicks starks hard in the back, nearly sending him down.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{no. that's not necessary.}
<A>__{becker looks down and sees his own blood fall on the floor. he looks up at starks who, even in his pain, looks shocked at the force he just used.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{let him go. [more firmly] i said, let him go!}
<A>__{as soon as they let him go, starks lunges for becker pushing him up against the wall. starks stops, presumably about to harm becker but unsure, even to himself, of what he's capable of doing... becker looks fearlessly into starks' eyes.}
<D>__{becker [an inch away from his face] what, starks? what are you going to do? end me just because i'm an inconvenience to you? [beat] just like you did with officer harrison?}
<A>__{starks' face registers the meaning in becker's words and a look of self doubt crosses his face.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{the only thing your mind is missing is a conscience.}
<A>__{starks lets go of him and, as soon as he does, damon and harding restrain him. becker calmly wipes the blood from his face, looks at his hand, shakes his head and walks out.}
<C>__{dr. gries}
<D>__{wait...dr. becker, how long do you want us to leave him in for?}
<A>__{becker doesn't answer. he doesn't even turn around. dr. gries goes after him.}
<C>__{dr. gries}
<D>__{just strap him in for now.}
<A>__{and damon and harding start to...}
