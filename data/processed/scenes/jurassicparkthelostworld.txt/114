<A>__{malcolm sarah, nick, kelly, and dr. juttson wait nervously in the communications room. an empty can of dr. pepper sitting on one of the countertops begins to rattle. they look over at it, confused, as the lightweight aluminum can chatters on the formica counter. other objects in the lab begin to rattle too. glass jars clank against one another, books start to drop off the shelves, a stool shudders across the floor.}

<A>__{above them, the rotting wooden roof of the building starts to actually tear away, chunks of moldy timber flying up into the night. they look up, a deafening roar fills the room and a helicopter's searchlight floods in! as the chopper dips lower, looking for a place to land, the violent prop wash rips away huge chunks of the roof over their heads.}
