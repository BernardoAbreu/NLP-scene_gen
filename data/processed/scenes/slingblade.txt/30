<A>__{the place is cluttered with mowers, edgers, weed eaters, and other equipment, most of it in pieces. a small cot is in a little clearing in the corner by the bathroom. karl is sweeping up oil with sawdust and a push broom while scooter puts some tools away. bill comes to the door.}

<C>__{bill}
<D>__{karl, they's a blanket up in under that cot and soap in the bathroom to clean up with.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{now there's one more thing. the way we lock these doors at night, you can't get out. you didn't want to go anywhere, did you?}
<C>__{karl}
<D>__{i don't reckon.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{if it works out and all, maybe we'll get you a key so you can get out at night if you need to. see you later.}
<A>__{they leave karl standing in the midst of the lawn mowers. he sets the broom down and goes and sits on the cot. after a moment, he gets back up and starts sweeping again.}
