<D>__{i had to leave this place. i got depressed, seeing all the crap. and the thing is, they're making more crap, you know? they've got so many stores and stuff and junk full of crap, i can't believe it.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{palm}
<D>__{who? people, that's who! pretty soon there won't be room for anyone. they're selling more crap that people go and buy than you can imagine. oofh! crap! i believe everybody should have a big hole where they throw in all this stuff and burn it.}
<A>__{rayette leans around to her.}
<C>__{rayette}
<D>__{there'd never be a hole big enough. now took at me, for instance, when i was just one person, before bobby, i had so much garbage collectin' onto me every day, i was thinkin' about gettin a dispose all...}
<C>__{palm}
<D>__{a dispose all, what's that but more crap? i've never seen such crap. oofh, i don't know how people get up in the morning.}

<C>__{terry}
<D>__{wait a minute. i'm not that neat, maybe, but i am clean.}
<C>__{palm}
<D>__{well, you're not that bad, but some people... i mean, people's homes, just filth. i've been in people's homes...}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{in my personal observation, i think that more people are neat than are clean...}
<C>__{palm}
<D>__{in my personal thing, i don't see that. i'm seeing more filth. a lot of filth. what they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. and uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{yeah, it could be adorable...}
<C>__{palm}
<D>__{and they picked up! i mean, it wouldn't be filthy, with coke bottles and whiskey, and those signs everywhere...}
<A>__{she gestures angrily out the window at the roadside billboards.}
<C>__{palm }
<D>__{... they oughta be erased! all those signs, selling crap, and more crap, and, i don't know, it's disgusting, i don't even want to talk about it!}
<A>__{bobby starts to say something:}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{well...}
<C>__{palm}
<D>__{it's just filthy. people are dirty. i think that's the biggest thing that's wrong with people. i think they wouldn't be as violent if they were clean, because then they wouldn't have anybody to pick on... oofh... dirt...}
<C>__{rayette}
<D>__{well...}
<C>__{palm}
<D>__{not dirt. see, dirt isn't bad. it's filth. filth is bad. that's what starts maggots and riots...}
