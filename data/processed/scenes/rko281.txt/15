<L>__{int the brown derby day night}
<A>__{the chic brown derby restaurant is the unquestioned palace of hollywood celebrities. the smug big wigs and desperate hangers on circulate and score points in the great game of movie gossip. in one corner booth sits hedda hopper, phoning in the latest salacious gossip to her newspaper. in the other corner booth louella parsons does the same. they occasionally glance back and forth at each other like ravenous hyenas eyeing the last bit of carrion. welles circulates between them. in a scene reminiscent of the famous citizen kane breakfast table scene with kane and emily, we shoot back and forth as welles applies his considerable charm to both women. welles is dressed differently with each of them; breakfast with hedda and dinner with louella. with hedda, morning:}

<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{what we are going to do is shoot life in all it's joyous complexity.}
<A>__{he takes out a coin and begins a magic trick}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{consider this quarter, my dear. you can touch it and feel it and were you to lean forward you could even smell it. why is it that in the movies a simple bit of reality a quarter, a room, a man }
<A>__{with hedda, morning:}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{becomes nothing but a lie? a trick. an illusion.}
<A>__{he makes the quarter 'completely disappear. hedda is charmed}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{i will show the reality behind the trick.}
<A>__{he makes the quarter appear again and shows the guts of the trick.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{i will use the illusions of hollywood to show . . . the truth.}
<C>__{hedda}
<D>__{what does truth have to do with movies?}
