<L>__{interior dungeon the pit night}
<A>__{akhun and his turanian slavers lead the female monks into a large circular chamber, lit by many torches. before them lies a pit, dark and foreboding, with a bamboo grid placed atop it. fariq enters, an aide holding the iron box he used earlier. fariq has a bandage on his face where conan struck him, and he looks even more angry and malevolent than before.}
<C>__{fariq}
<D>__{here we stand again. will the queen reveal herself, or must another innocent suffer?}
<A>__{fariq walks past the row of women, each recoiling. he slaps one. then another, his rage only building.}
<C>__{fariq }
<D>__{my father, he tires of your charade. he grows impatient. but i have no such haste. i enjoy watching you squirm.}
<A>__{fariq passes ilira, slowing his pace. he closes in on the youngest female monk, a true innocent with terrified eyes.}
<C>__{fariq }
<D>__{perhaps you'd like to see the end your sisters faced back at the monastery?}
<A>__{fariq slowly opens the box before her.}
<B>__{acheronian box}
<A>__{in the darkness of the box slithers a grotesque tentacle. the tentacle is severed, but still alive, thirsting for blood. terrified as she is, the young monk says nothing. fariq closes the box.}
<C>__{fariq }
<D>__{no? your fear is not enough yet? let's try harder.}
<A>__{fariq nods to the slavers, who unchain her from the rest.}
<C>__{fariq }
<D>__{i've read all there is to know of mighty acheron. why would true acheronians protect a traitor to their own? you once held the entire world in your grasp, now you hide and cower like pitiful mice.}
<A>__{he pushes the girl. she falls to the grid, the sound echoing down into the pit. an inhuman growl emits from the darkness. something comes. the girl looks below.}
<C>__{fariq }
<D>__{and mice are meant to be swallowed whole.}
<A>__{suddenly, a massive tentacle, ten times the size of the one in the box, comes hurtling up through the grid. it grabs the young monk, its barbs ripping into her, dragging her into the darkness below. her screams echo.}
<C>__{fariq }
<D>__{what was in the box could only drink from you one at a time. but the beast of acheron, it will claim four of you this night.}
<C>__{fariq }
<D>__{who will spare the rest and tell me which of you is the queen?}
<A>__{not a single woman moves, resolved. ilira catches herself, but also stays silent. she looks up to see fariq staring at her. cu ilira's eyes her pupils widen in fear as fariq's cold stare bores into her.}
<C>__{female voice }
<D>__{i am here, swine.}
<A>__{fariq turns only it is another female monk that glares at him.}
<C>__{female monk}
<D>__{i am the one you seek.}
<A>__{fariq smiles.}
<C>__{fariq}
<D>__{at last. some bravery. but of course, you wouldn't expect me to take your word, would you?}
<A>__{as the fariq reaches for her }
