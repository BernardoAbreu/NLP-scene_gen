<L>__{interior saul's apartment later}
<A>__{saul silver is constructing a cross shaped joint (two joints that intersect one another). pot and paraphernalia are scattered all over the coffee table. a large "scarface" movie poster hangs on the wall. there is a knock at the door and dale enters.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{what's up, saul.}
<C>__{saul}
<P>__{(unpleasantly surprised)}
<D>__{what the fuck?!?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{i didn't buzz you in. how the monkey did you get in here?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{whoa...sorry, man. someone just let me in. i }
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{that's fucked up, man! this building is filled with fuckin' assholes. what else is the buzzer for? fuck.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{i will buzz next time, man. i'm real sorry. i'm just not familiar with your, uh...protocol yet.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{hey, stuff your sorry's i n a sack, bro. we're always cool. it's those fuckin' jaggoffs.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{um...sure.}
<A>__{dale awkwardly sits down on the other side of the couch.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{brass tacs. i've got this new bud. unfortunately, it's a few more bones, but fortunately, it's hands down the dopest fuckin' shit i ever smoked. and i've smoked some dope fuckin' shit.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{better than that blue oyster weed?}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{dude. seriously. it's like if that blue oyster shit and the afghan kush i got had a baby, and meanwhile, the craziest northern lights and that red ass espresso snowflake had a baby, and then by some miracle those babies met, and fucked then this would be the shit they'd birth.}
<A>__{saul pulls out a big bag of weed. he places it on the coffee table as though it was his child. he pulls out a large bud.}
<C>__{saul }
<D>__{smell it.}
<A>__{dale takes the weed and looks at it. it looks spectacular. bright red hairs and large crystals, huge purple and blue leaves just spectacular! dale smells it and is taken aback.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{what is this? it's spectacular.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{it's called pineapple express. my guy red told me it's when this hawaiian flood takes special dirt to the weed or some shit. it's pretty scientific. and i'm the only guy in the whole city who has it. and, its only ten bones more for a quarter.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{so...can i get a quarter?}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{no doubt. just let me grab my scale.}
<A>__{saul walks into another room. dale looks around anxiously; he clearly wants to go. a moment later, saul comes back into the room and sits down. dale notices that he didn't bring anything back from the other room. saul notices dale looking at him strangely.}
<C>__{saul }
<D>__{what's with the look? what?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{where's the scale?}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{oh shit! the scale. be right back.}
<A>__{saul hustles into the other room.}
<D>__{saul (o.s.) (cont'd)}
<P>__{(from other room)}
<D>__{you know what's weird? how sometimes, your brain just chooses to like, not keep things in it, you know?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{fucking scale.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{shit. where is it?}
<A>__{dale checks his watch and then looks at the door; suddenly, something catches his eye it's the cross joint saul was constructing.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{holy shit! what the fuck is this thing?}
<A>__{saul comes back in and puts a small electronic scale on the coffee table.}
<C>__{saul}
<P>__{(nonchalantly)}
<D>__{ah, the cross jointerior you've never seen one of these? not surprising. they are, like, the apex of the vortex of joint engineering. nasa built the first one in the eighties.}
<A>__{saul chuckles at his joke as he places some weed on the scale.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{you can actually smoke that contraption?}
<A>__{saul puts dale's weed in a baggie.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{you light all three ends at the same time, then, you smoke it as it resonates the main section, creating a "trifecta" of smoking power. it's like, three times as powerful as a normal jointerior}
<A>__{dale hands saul some money and saul gives him his weed. dale lingers for a moment.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{well, be careful with that thing.}
<A>__{dale gets up and heads to the door.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{dude...you wanna smoke this thing with me?}
<A>__{dale turns around. he clearly wants to smoke it, but he tries to play it cool.}
<C>__{saul }
<D>__{i can't even light it on my own.}
<A>__{dale sits back down on the couch, giddy as a schoolgirl.}
<C>__{dale}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{wow. so like, uh...so like, so like what do i do?}
<A>__{saul gathers three lighters from the coffee table.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{alright. firstly you light these two ends. then i will light the tip, making the trifecta complete. are you ready?}
<A>__{dale nods and they light the jointerior saul tokes hard; plumes of smoke fill the air as he bursts into a coughing}
<B>__{fit.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{holy...}
<A>__{dale takes the joint and hits it, exploding into a coughing fit.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{it's...uh, it's good to cough. cough it opens the cough capillaries...gets you twenty five percent higher.}
<C>__{saul }
<D>__{and that, combined with the pineapple weed, and the cross joint cough you're a good thirty to forty times higher. i don't know the exact math, but, pff, you're pretty fucking gong showed. you know what i mean?}
<A>__{saul takes a toke. dale coughs harder and harder. he seems like he might throw up.}
<C>__{saul }
<D>__{it's crazy. the better the weed, the more i wish i could think of how to explain what's so good about it, but the...uh, the better it is, the less shit i can think of in total, you know?}
<A>__{saul passes dale the joint, obliviously dropping ash all over his suit. slightly agitated, dale brushes it off.}
<C>__{saul }
<D>__{okay, so, like, you've been buying from me for, like, a few months now and i really gotta ask.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what's with the suit?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{i'm a process server.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{you`re a servant? like, a butler.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{no, process server.}
<A>__{saul looks confused.}
<C>__{dale }
<D>__{i'm hired to give people papers they don't want. it's pretty much the easiest job on earth.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{nice, man. where'd you get that job?}
<A>__{dale takes a big hit from the jointerior}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{well...uh, i got a totally useless degree two years ago, then i did nothing for a year, then my dad got so fed up he hooked me up.}
<A>__{they both revel in the thought.}
<C>__{dale }
<D>__{i got it pretty sweet, though. today? i smoked like five joints, gave out some pieces of paper, and i ate some burger king }
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{hey man, did you get those new chicken fries?}
<A>__{dale passes the join to saul.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{yeah man. i'd get on that shit. they're fucking mind blowing. so, then i hot boxed my car and then...got some action from my girlfriend.}
<A>__{saul laughs at this.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{does she smoke pot?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{a little. she's in high school.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{that's fuckin' sweet! ilegal love! you're like jerry lee lewis. i just read his biography.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{no, no. she's 19.}
<C>__{saul}
<P>__{(dissappointed)}
<D>__{oh. it's still cool i guess.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{yeah, it's awesome, although i think she's getting old enough where she's realizing i don't do much. and these high school guys these days. they're all roided out and going to harvard. even on my best days, i look like a fat, dumb piece of shit next to them.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{whatever, man. it sounds like you got it pretty good. i wish i had a job that easy. fuck.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{dude...you've got, like, the actual easiest job in the world.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{hey! you're right, man. i never thought of it like that.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{you can actually do whatever the hell you want. you get to sleep all day and people come buy weed at night.}
<A>__{dale passes saul the jointerior}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{that's totally true. except tomorrow. thanks to that bitch daylight savings, i gotta go change my grandma's clocks forward at 7am. or 8am. i seriously can't figure it out.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{sorry to hear that.}
<A>__{saul passes dale the jointerior}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{yo, so, like, what have these people done that you go after?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{let's see...tonight i'm going after }
<A>__{dale pulls a blue envelope out of his pocket.}
<C>__{dale }
<D>__{ted jones. he forgot to pay his }
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{dude! my guy, red, gets his weed from a ted jones. he's, like, #1 supplier in town. maybe it's him!}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{i doubt that, man. there's probably a lot of ted joneses's out there.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{yeah, but not like this one, man! he's what i want to be one day. he's like the "jesus of weed". so...i guess he's like jah. or scarface.}
<A>__{saul points to his scarface poster. the joint ends. after a few moments it seems as though their ability to have a conversation burnt out with the jointerior they sit in awkward silence. dale gets up.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{well saul, that was crazy. thanks.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{no worries dude, peace.}
<A>__{they slap each other five and dale exits. saul turns on the tv. saved by the bell is on. it makes saul chuckle.}
