<A>__{she strains to move his dead weight. her feet slip on the ice and she lets go of him, catching herself on the open door. she grabs the body under the armpits, hauls with all her strength. drags him a few yards away from the oldsmobile. his boot heels ploughing twin gouges in the snow. behind her, gravity pulls the heavy car door shut with a soft}

<A>__{suddenly her feet go out from under her as she hits a patch of ice. she goes down hard on her ass, sprawling. sits there a beat, as headlights appear on the dark horizon. we see them a split second before she does... he's coming. when she glimpses the oncoming headlights out of the corner of her eye she turns her head slowly in their direction, and for an instant it almost seems as if they don't register. then her eyes widen in terror, she lets out a small whimper, and leaps into action. she scrambles to her feet and makes a mad dash toward the oldsmobile only to find when she tugs on the handle that it's stuck. she yanks on it harder, getting frantic now, as the headlights get brighter, bearing down, close enough now that we can hear the roar of the oncoming engine. she kicks the handle, tugs with all her might, rocking the car but not succeeding in getting the door open. as the headlights become blinding... suddenly there's the sound of brakes being engaged, and the headlights slow to a stop just a few yards shy of where she's standing in the middle of the road. she shields her eyes with an upraised hand. it's a snowplow. the snowplow driver, 50s, sticks his head out the window.}
