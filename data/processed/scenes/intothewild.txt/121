<A>__{chris, with a grin on his face, lays in his sleeping bag between a hudderite and the sleeping kevin. wayne comes from the back bedroom, tip toes through the sleeping bodies to hand chris a pillow.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{get a good sleep. see you in the morning.}
<A>__{chris waves a thanks, puts the pillow beneath his head and closes his eyes.}
<L>__{exterior sunburst day}
<A>__{we are tight on chris' hand atop the shifter of one of wayne's lumbering harvesters.}
<C>__{wayne }
<D>__{okay. now take hold of the joystick, get the feel of header, idle it down with the toggle switch...}
<A>__{as chris makes the attempt, we immediately hear the grinding of gears, the instrument alarms in chaos. wide shot: chris and wayne sit atop a combine. in the background we see wayne's trailer and two other combines piloted by wayne's crew members on the ocean of ripe blond grain. chris tries his hand at the shifter once more. this time the thing starts to move.}
<C>__{wayne }
<D>__{that's it. that's it. now take it on out and make yourself some money.}
<A>__{wayne jumps off the combine and chris begins to cut his pattern, intermittently struggling with the shifter. wayne laughs his ass off.}
