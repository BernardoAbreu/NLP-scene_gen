<L>__{exterior auto graveyard night}
<A>__{teams of men pile out of the vehicles. the back of the semi is opened, revealing racks of remote operated amplifiers. others unload inch thick, eight foot square sheets of glass, rimmed with aluminum pipe, and inscribed with ancient texterior the glass sheets are assembled to form a large cube. arrays of flood lamps illuminate the canyons of the wrecking yard in stark white. one side of the cube remains open... allowing entry and ready to come down in theory, and close the improvised "mousetrap." rafkin walks up behind cyrus, still massaging his temples.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{where'd he get a name like the breaker anyway? he a truck driver?}
<C>__{cyrus}
<D>__{it's simply folklore at work. the local color exorcising its demons...}
<A>__{just then, a hideous howl echoes through the night part human, part god knows what. everyone stops. rafkin swallows hard. tosses away the empty prescription drugs bottle, then opens an extra large jar of aspirin, pops a few into his mouth, crunches them like mints.}
<C>__{cyrus}
<D>__{... or maybe it's because he broke his victims into as many pieces as possible.}
<P>__{(exhaling smoke)}
<D>__{who's to say...?}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{cute...}
<A>__{a shrill cacophony of metal and glass erupts from the maze of the graveyard. a large, dense object flies out of the darkness and crashes down in front of them in a cloud of dust. it's a crushed car. cyrus sighs...}
<C>__{cyrus}
<D>__{i hate being rushed.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{cyrus, this one ain't like the others...}
<P>__{(off the teams)}
<D>__{do they know what we're up against?}
<C>__{cyrus}
<D>__{these men are well paid. that's all they need to know.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{but this is suicide...}
<C>__{cyrus}
<D>__{then i will match their price... and yours.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{you don't have that kind of money.}
<C>__{cyrus}
<D>__{you'd be surprised... now get to work.}
<A>__{this takes rafkin by surprise. he turns, taking a step towards cyrus. cyrus backs up, his cane instantly at rafkin's chest, keeping him distant. rafkin becomes suspicious.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{what are you hiding, old man?}
<C>__{cyrus}
<D>__{careful, dennis, curiosity killed the cat.}
<C>__{damon }
<D>__{son of a bitch!}
<A>__{they both turn to see four team members dragging an attractive man and woman, damon quinteros and kalina oretzia, over to cyrus. damon's a handsome chap with a righteous fire in his eyes. kalina, his lover, is equally fiery, late 20s, tough and sexy. she cradles in her arms an ancient book.}
<C>__{damon}
<D>__{how can you possibly justify what you're doing, cyrus? it's out and out slavery.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{aw, jeezus, here we go again.}
<C>__{cyrus}
<D>__{damon quinteros and kalina oretzia. every time i hunt must i scrape you off the bottom of my shoes?}
<C>__{kalina}
<D>__{these aren't animals you're trapping! they're human beings!}
<C>__{cyrus}
<D>__{why don't you guys go join greenpeace or throw blood on the old ladies' fur coats, for christ's sake... we have business.}
<C>__{kalina}
<P>__{(to cyrus)}
<D>__{bastard! who are you to play god?!}
<C>__{cyrus}
<D>__{playing's for children. i'm going to be god.}
<C>__{damon}
<D>__{you'll never pull it off! not without the right spells. that and the thirteenth ghost!}
<A>__{rafkin turns, alarmed.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{thirteenth?}
<C>__{cyrus}
<D>__{get them out of my sight. we've wasted enough time as it is.}
<A>__{the team straps damon and kalina to some car wreckage.}
<C>__{assistant }
<P>__{(on headphones)}
<D>__{all teams in position, mr. kriticos.}
<C>__{cyrus}
<D>__{excellent... set up the transmitters. cyrus turns away from them as he slips on a pair of ghost glasses. the rest of the team around the graveyard do so as well.}
<A>__{cyrus starts to climb a wall of cars for a better view of his battlefield.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<P>__{(calling after him)}
<D>__{wait a minute! the breaker's number twelve! you said we needed twelve!}
<C>__{cyrus}
<D>__{yes, and then one more. i thought you were psychic.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{you know it doesn't work like that }
