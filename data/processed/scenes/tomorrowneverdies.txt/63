<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{the h.m.s. indomitable moving through fog in the strait of malacca, night.}
<L>__{interior bridge night}
<A>__{the room is bathed in blue light as the crew monitors the indomita ble's command and control systems. at the vertical glass map, the ship's course has been charted from hong kong, south, down around singapore, then north, where the yellow blinking dot indicates it's currently in the strait of malacca. standing in front of the map, however, the navigation officer seems perplexed. he's comparing what's on the screen to a piece of paper in his hand. something is wrong.}
<C>__{navigation officer}
<D>__{... this doesn't make sense. what's our heading now?}
<A>__{the helmsman looks down at his compass auto pilot. insert compass auto pilot moving from west to north then holding on a north position.}
<C>__{helmsman}
<D>__{zero one three. due north.}
<A>__{the two officers share a look. something is odd, but }
<C>__{helmsman}
<D>__{we're on course again.}
<A>__{just then, the first officer enters from the exterior bridge.}
<C>__{first officer}
<D>__{can't see a damn thing in this fog.}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{rating: what have we got?}
<A>__{he joins the rating and communication's officers at their scopes.}
<C>__{rating}
<D>__{a passenger ferry and two freighters broadcasting on low band }
<C>__{communications}
<D>__{and two small fishing boats about 30k north. no radar, but we've identified their engine signatures.}
<A>__{as the first officer takes this in:}
<C>__{helmsman }
<D>__{damn. it's doing it again.}
<C>__{first officer}
<P>__{(joining him)}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{helmsman}
<D>__{about every ninety seconds, the auto pilot jogs us to the west.}
<A>__{he points down to the compass auto pilot, swinging west...}
<C>__{helmsman}
<D>__{then re sets us to the north.}
<A>__{the compass reaches dead west then starts to swing back north.}
<C>__{helmsman }
<D>__{the captain wants us on the east side of the channel. ...cross current?}
<C>__{first officer}
<D>__{not in the strait.}
<P>__{(to the navigator)}
<D>__{how's our position?}
<C>__{navigating officer}
<D>__{according to the satellite, we're exactly on course.}
<C>__{first officer}
<D>__{did you check the auto pilot?}
<C>__{helmsman}
<D>__{the back up does the same thing.}
<C>__{first officer}
<D>__{check it again. what about the global positioning satellite? could there be something wrong with the signal?}
<C>__{gps officer}
<D>__{two words: im possible.}
