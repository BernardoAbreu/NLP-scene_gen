<L>__{interior the bone pit night}
<A>__{karen rises, wary, taking in her shadowed surroundings.}
<B>__{heaps of human bones}
<A>__{are piled against the pit walls skulls, rib cages, femurs, tibias all picked clean of flesh. some of the skulls have large, canine like fangs the remnants, no doubt, of long deceased vampires. suddenly we hear a whisper of sorts, the soft clinking of bone fragments grinding together karen spins, trying to place the source of the sound. then she hears the sound again. behind her now, closer.}
<C>__{revenant }
<D>__{karennnnn }
<A>__{karen looks up with a growing sense of dread.}
<B>__{a face}
<A>__{emerges from the darkness. pallid, cadaverous, shedding its desiccated flesh. lidless eyes like black marbles slick with vaseline. a mouth like a raw wound.}
<C>__{revenant}
<D>__{karreennnnnn. i never thought i'd see you againnnnn.}
<A>__{karen backs away, realizing who she's standing before.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{curtis?!}
<A>__{what used to be curtis snarls, knocking karen back into the drift pile of bones. it pins her to the ground, kneeling above her, gurgling through its gutted trachea.}
<C>__{curtis revenant}
<D>__{tell, me, karennn ever have second thoughts about us?}
<A>__{karen screams, trying to force the revenant away from her, but it lunges closer, lolling its distended tongue over her mouth in a pathetic approximation of a french kiss. she fumbles behind her, choking, grabbing hold of a human femur, blindly swinging it upward crack! the blow shatters the curtis thing's jaw. it rears back, falling to the side. karen crawls out from under its weight, swinging the femur again and again crack! crack! crack! karen pummels the howling horror, driving it back until the femur actually splinters in half. the creature's head hangs at an awkward angle now, its neck broken but still it advances, dragging itself back up. sobbing, karen retreats, clutching the splintered femur like a makeshift dagger. curtis charges at her, a blur of slashing claws. at the last moment, karen ducks, thrusting the bone dagger up into curtis' chest curtis impales himself, right through the heart. for one split second, his eyes widen in surprise and then he goes into a death spasm, vomiting up a spray of caustic vampire blood bile, spattering karen. she sinks to her knees, gasping, as the thing that used to be curtis shrivels up, melting away into burbling puddle. after a beat, karen rises and moves to the pit wall, running her hands over the lichen slick surface, searching for a way out. the mortar between the brickwork is ancient, crumbling. karen looks to the ground, reaching for one of the splintered femurs. she pounds it into the mortar between two bricks and it holds, working as a makeshift piton. karen reaches for another broken femur, lodging it a foot above the first. she hauls her body up now, suspending her weight from the two makeshift pitons. again, they hold. trembling from exertion, karen pulls the right piton free, hanging solely from her left hand now. though her handhold is precarious, she manages to swing the right hand up again, pounding that piton another foot above the left. in this slow, torturous manner, karen begins to climb her way up out of the pit.}
