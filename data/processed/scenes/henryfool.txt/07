<L>__{interior world of donuts day}
<A>__{this is a convenience store with a number of tables at which to eat donuts. warren is shoplifting while amy terrorizes gnoc deng, the vietnamese cashier, who stares out at them from behind the safety of the counter.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{say something.}
<C>__{warren}
<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{she's mute.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{warren}
<D>__{she don't you know talk.}
<A>__{amy looks back at gnoc, snarls, then follows the cashier's gaze to the door. simon enters. clutching henry's cash, he stops dead in his tracks when he sees... warren and amy. he steps forward and approaches the beer cooler. warren and amy hover around, just out of reach, like a couple of vampires. dragging a six pack out of the cooler, simon crosses to the counter. warren and amy hang back, silent and threatening. gnoc rings up the purchase and glances over at... amy, staring a hole into the side of simon's skull. gnoc hands simon back his change and he makes for the door, but... warren shoves himself between it and simon. simon freezes. warren is expressionless. simon looks back at amy. she turns away, reaches up under her skirt, jerks down her panties, then leans forward on to the counter. leering back over her shoulder, she hisses...}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{kiss my ass.}
<A>__{simon is nonplussed. gnoc presses a button on the wall that sets... a red light flashing above the stockroom door. warren grabs simon by the neck and drags him over to amy's bare behind. amy laughs as simon is forced to his knees and has his face shoved up right into the crack of her ass. but then... simon throws up all over her. warren falls back in disgust. gnoc covers her face with her hands. amy looks around at herself, realizes, and starts screaming bloody murder. simon falls back on to the floor, clutching his stomach, as amy staggers around with her vomit strewn underwear down around her ankles. then gnoc's father, mr deng, appears at the stockroom door holding a shovel and ready to fight.}
<C>__{warren}
<P>__{(scared)}
<D>__{oh, shit!}
<A>__{mr deng comes running at them and warren drags amy from the store. simon crawls out of the way as the old man throws open the door to the parking lot and screams at the retreating delinquents...}
<C>__{mr deng}
<P>__{(in vietnamese)}
<D>__{stay the hell out of my store, you good for nothing punks!}
<A>__{having scared them off, he comes back in and starts screaming at simon.}
<C>__{mr deng}
<D>__{look at this! what's going on here? simon, get up off the floor! is this beer paid for?}
