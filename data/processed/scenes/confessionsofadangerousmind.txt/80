<L>__{exterior field day}
<A>__{renda's contorted face in close up as he is shot. blood spurting. echoey church bells chime.}
<C>__{renda}
<D>__{no me mates. yo tengo tres bebes.}
<L>__{interior apartment evening}
<A>__{barris puts down his bag, pulls the spanish english dictionary from his pocket, and tries to translate what renda said. it takes him a while but he does.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{"don't kill me. i am three babies." i am three babies? what the fuck does that mean?}
<P>__{(studies dictionary)}
<D>__{oh. "i have three babies." oh, god.}
<A>__{barris drops to the floor and throws up into a trash can. out of the corner of his eye, he catches a movement in the living room. he lurches backwards, knocks over the can. vomit spills onto the carpet.}
<C>__{penny }
<P>__{(groggily)}
<D>__{chuck, is that you throwing up?}
<A>__{in the dim light from the hallway, barris spots penny lying on the couch. she is dressed as a hippy. a backpack and a duffel lie on the floor next to her.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{jesus christ, penny. you scared the shit out of me. what are you doing here?}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{sorry. i just been crashing here for a few days. waiting for you. where you been, man, where you been?}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{mexico. just on a little vaca...}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{you drank the water, didn't you?}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{you're not supposed to. montessori's revenge. you're not even allowed to open your mouth or your eyes when you take a shower. it's crazy. how come our water is so good and their water is poison? it's the same ocean.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{it's weird, huh?}
<P>__{(beat, then proudly)}
<D>__{so i'm a hippy now. look.}
<A>__{penny stands in the dimness to show off her outfit.}
<C>__{penny }
<D>__{i've been in san francisco, and it's amazing. everybody loves everybody and there's lots of colors. we're gonna change the world, chuck. come back with me and be my old man, okay? not that old! ha ha ha.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{penny, i'm a little tired now, so...}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{oh! you gotta hear this song!}
<A>__{penny shrieks excitedly as she runs to the record player. she turns it on, plugs in a strobe light. "sunshine superman" starts up. penny sings and dances along, directing the lyrics at barris. barris looks around at his strobing apartment. he sees penny's mess: pot paraphenalia, anti war posters, a gold dove painted on the wall with a phone number underneath.}
<C>__{penny }
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{"cause i made my mind up, you're going to be mine..."}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{penny, what did you do to my wall?}
<C>__{penny}
<P>__{(looking)}
<D>__{oh, it's a guy who called a couple a days ago. gold bird. isn't it pretty?}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{leonard goldberg?! you're kidding?}
<P>__{(dials phone anxiously)}
<D>__{hello, this is chuck barris returning for leonard goldberg.}
<A>__{pause. barris paces. penny sings and dances in background.}
<C>__{goldberg }
<D>__{hi, chuck!}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{mr. goldberg! i'm so sorry i didn't get back to you right away. i was out of town. vacationing in mexico.}
<C>__{goldberg}
<D>__{good for you. listen, chuck. we've ended up with a damn hole in our daytime schedule. i've been reviewing some options, and it occurred to me there might be a place here for you and your baby.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{my baby, mr. goldberg?}
<C>__{goldberg}
<D>__{the dating game.}
<P>__{(joshingly)}
<D>__{that is your baby, isn't it, chuck?}
<C>__{barris}

<C>__{goldberg}
<D>__{great. keep me posted.}
<A>__{dial tone. barris sits there, phone in hand, then throws up again into the trash can. penny stops dancing, watches.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{damn mexicans and their water.}
