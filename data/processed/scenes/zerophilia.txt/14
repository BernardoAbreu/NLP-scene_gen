<L>__{interior sydney's bed & breakfast late night}
<A>__{on a corner table sits high tech laboratory equipment. keenan and luke gulp beers, still in shock. luke keeps one hand down his pants for reassurance.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{in the world? a hundred. a thousand. there's no way to know. it doesn't show up in any normal dna test. it's triggered when you first have sex.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{the woman in the rv!}
<C>__{keenan}
<P>__{(dark)}
<D>__{from utah.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{now, you're morphescent whenever you're aroused.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{you tellin' me this is gonna' happen any time he gets the hots for a girl?}
<A>__{keenan looks over at luke...}
<C>__{keenan }
<D>__{man, this could be a problem.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{is there a cure?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{it's not a disease! but there are steps you can take.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{well, what are they?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{take it easy. you can't rush this. before anything, you need to try going all the way.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{"all the way?"}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{you need to turn all the way into a female.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you out of your mind?!}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{you have to give it a try.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{maybe we should get a second opinion.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{yeah, may be! 'cause you can forget that!}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{fine, but i warn you, they've never seen this before. first, they'll try a barrage of antipsychotic medications, surgery, electroshock therapy, god knows what.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{if he were to try goin' all the way, then what?}
<A>__{luke glares at him.}
<C>__{keenan }
<D>__{i'm just askin'.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{it ain't gonna' happen!}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{oh, for chris' sake! i'm trying to help you. that z chromosome's not latent anymore! you don't get control a' that thing, you don't know when it's going to kick in, what it's gonna' do! you want to end up with three left breasts, behemoth hips and one testicle?!}
<A>__{luke and keenan swallow, wide eyed at the prospect. sydney calms herself down.}
<C>__{sydney }
<D>__{now, there's no reason for that to happen. sorry. you're not the only one who didn't get any sleep. now, are you going to let me help, or not?}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{how would he even do that? go all the way, i mean?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{he's a z.}
<P>__{(to luke)}
<D>__{you become morphescent when you get turned on. you can change all the way when you have an orgasm.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{with who?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i'm available.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no way!}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{well, excuse me. truth is, at this stage, you don't really need anyone else.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{huh?}
<A>__{sydney wearily sips a highball. she looks to keenan for help. keenan flashes the international sign for jacking off.}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{it's a lot to absorb, i know. when you're ready, give me a call. your first time, you shouldn't be alone.}
