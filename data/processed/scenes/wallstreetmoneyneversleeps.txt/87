<L>__{exterior adirondack forest preserve day 2.7 million acres of state protected majestic land. all}
<A>__{nature... rivers and lakes... cypresses and maples. clean air. and trails. many trails that go on for miles. as the two becker jetvans arrive at a restricted area, a state ranger opens the gate and allows them to drive through then park. jacob and bretton emerge from the jetvan.}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{this is how we do.}
<A>__{and with a nod, the driver of the other jetvan opens it to reveal two motorcycles inside. bretton's mtt turbine superbike and an agusta, these bikes are handcrafted works of art as much as they are demons of speed. jacob laughs in disbelief and excitement.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{and we're allowed to ride these through here?}
<A>__{sucking in the fresh summer air...}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{no.}
<B>__{and jacob and bretton}
<A>__{now decked out in leather riding gear... on the bikes... at the mouth of the trail... revving the engines...}
<C>__{bretton woods }
<D>__{follow me...}
<A>__{and with that, shoots into the forest. jacob quickly follows.}
<B>__{and they ride}
<A>__{winding through the trees... along the side of a river... bretton riding extremely fast with jacob trying to keep up. bretton reaches a clearing and waits for jacob to catch up. once he does...}
<C>__{bretton woods }
<D>__{you're going to have to keep up.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{okay. i'm just getting used to it.}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{tell me your idea.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{here?}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{where else?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{right. okay.}
<P>__{(collecting himself)}
<D>__{are you still short any of the financials?}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{no. after kzi, i took profits.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i think it's time to go the other way.}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{banks?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{insurance companies. i'm talking the old school insurers that have become the babies thrown out with the bath water.}
<A>__{jacob waits for a reaction from bretton. but all he gets is...}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{keep up!}
<A>__{and with that, bretton rips into the clearing. jacob rides just as fast. they're neck and neck... it's definitely a race. bretton pulls ahead but jacob doesn't give up. as they move quickly toward a patch of forest with a only narrow trail entering it, jacob focuses on the horizon and revs the bike into more speed. he pulls up next to bretton as they approach the trail. if jacob doesn't slow down, and fall in line behind bretton, he's going to hit the trees. but he doesn't. instead, jacob blasts the bike into its final dose of speed, narrowly avoiding impact by zipping into the trail... pulling ahead of bretton and taking the lead.}
<B>__{a tranquil lake}
<A>__{as it sits still in the setting sun. untouched by man. bretton and jacob get off the bikes and walk to the shore. as they catch their breaths and enjoy the beauty...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{the basket of stocks i'm putting together focuses on reinsurance brokering and management services for businesses. they're trading below book and have large dividends.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i say we buy them here.}
<A>__{bretton thinks about it. he's not sure.}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{financials are a falling knife.}
<A>__{jacob nods...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i'm not arguing that... but the best opportunities are found where angels fear to tread.}
<A>__{jacob can see... he has bretton on the hook.}
<C>__{jacob }
<D>__{so yeah they are falling knives. but bretton...}
<A>__{and with confidence... driving it home...}
<C>__{jacob }
<D>__{... what's life without a little blood on your hands?}
