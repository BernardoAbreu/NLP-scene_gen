<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i found the last time you were happy.}
<A>__{robin adjusts the viewfinder and presses play on the camera. george doesn't wake up. on the tiny screen, we see a younger george in the ocean, his arms wrapped around six year old sam; he shields sam from the waves and kisses his son's hair. robin rests the camera on the bed as the video continues to play. she takes hold of george's hand and begins to weep as she presses her head on his chest. an envelope with robin and sam's name on it rests on the nightstand beside the bed.}
