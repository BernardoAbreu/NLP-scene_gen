<A>__{stauffenberg and haeften rush toward olbricht's office, stopping when they see a mass of soldiers surrounding the doorway. a chill runs down our spines when we see herber talking to none other than major remer. just then, he spots stauffenberg and haeften.}

<D>__{you there.}
<A>__{stauffenberg and haeften turn and run.}
<C>__{remer }
<D>__{halt.}
<A>__{bang. a shot is fired. stauffenberg and haeften take cover in a nearby doorway. haeften returns fire. stauffenberg clamps his pistol under the stump of his right arm, managing to cock it with the three fingers of his left hand. awkward. then he aims and fires. stauffenberg takes a bullet in the shoulder of his good arm. he drops his gun, bleeding badly. but more soldiers appear at the opposite end of the corridor. the loyal haeften covers stauffenberg with his body, aiming to fire. but stauffenberg stops him, shaking his head. it's over. they toss down their guns. boot steps approach loudly o.s. as stauffenberg looks down at the cross and ring around his neck:}
<C>__{haeften}
<D>__{thank you, colonel.}
<A>__{stauffenberg is genuinely confused. "for what?"}
