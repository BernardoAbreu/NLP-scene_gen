<L>__{interior yamashiro inn pavilion late day}
<A>__{(japanese "mood music" over), featuring a morbid, nearly suicidal saxophone solo:) john and harry seated at a table. she is well past the loosening effects of a second glass of wine, is not unaware that harry is looking at her: he lights a cigarette. as she reaches to her glass, his eyes follow the motion of her hands. she looks in front the window:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{how long have you been divorced?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{oh, i'd say seven or eight years, around there.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{and so you like, well, assuming you live a single existence, i mean most men don't seem to enjoy that, i've read.}
<A>__{she lifts her glass, takes a sip, then sets it back down:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i have to tell you the truth...}
<P>__{(he pauses)}
<D>__{i've been observing your hands, and i have to use the word exquisite.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{really? well...}
<A>__{embarrassed by the compliment, she reaches to her glass and nearly knocks it over, spilling a bit of wine onto the tablecloth and is relieved to find him gazing off and unaware of her gaffe.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you're probably quite a singer too.}
<P>__{(looking back to her)}
<D>__{i'd like to come down and catch you sometime.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{yes, anytime. do you like classical music?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{very much. even to the degree that when it's playing on the radio, i sometimes have to turn the damn thing off.}
<A>__{thinking he is revealing a peculiar brand of wit, she laughs.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{i just mean it starts to get to me too much. i can't swallow my saliva.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i shouldn't have laughed.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah, symphonies, operettas, poems, things like that. all those type of things really get to me.}
<C>__{joan}
<P>__{(looking intensely at him)}
<D>__{uhm hmm.}
<A>__{a japanese hostess appears at the table, bowing reveren tially and gesturing that their table is ready.}
