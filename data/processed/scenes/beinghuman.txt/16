<A>__{the raiders wade out to the waiting boats. hector follows to the very water's edge, then stands and bleakly watches them. the raiders prepare to move off. hector is an embarrassment to them now. at the last moment the leader gives a brusque order to one of his men. the man clambers out of the boat and wades ashore again, carrying a large flint bladed knife. he comes out of the water and walks up to hector. hector is beyond any form of reaction. he will take whatever is offered to him. the man comes close, the knife held ready. he stands in front of hector for a moment. on the boat, hector's family are tense with fear for his life. then the tense moment passes, as the man grunts and nods at hector's hands, still bound with rope. hector under stands. he lifts his hands and the man with some effort hacks through the rough hemp. then he turns and wades back to the boat. as the man clambers aboard the leader speaks to him. the man stops, drops back into the water, and returns to hector on the shore. he offers hector the cut piece of rope, a weird gesture of conciliation. he even smiles. hector refuses the gift. the man stands sheepishly for a moment, then drops the rope at hector's feet and wades back to the boat. a piece of rope in exchange for a family. hector watches them for some time, his family and the strange raiders, as they, achingly slowly, retreat from his view and his life. at last he turns and moves up from the shoreline. he goes some distance then stops, thinks for a moment, then retraces his steps. he goes back to the water's edge, picks up the piece of rope that bound him, and walks off with it. it might be of some use to him.}
