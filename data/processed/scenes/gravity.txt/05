<B>__{she turns off the light.}
<A>__{ryan closes her eyes, simply listening to the lullaby as it grows fainter...}
<C>__{ryan }
<P>__{(growing ever drowsier)}
<D>__{that's nice. keep singing, aningang, just like that. sing me to sleep. i will sleep and sleep and sleep. sing to me, aningang... sing...sing....}
<A>__{the transmission grows fainter... ...and fainter... ...and then is... ...gone. for a long beat ryan merely sits there. she is gently humming a tune. it is a lullaby.}
<B>__{she surrenders. she weeps.}
<A>__{a quiet deep sorrow that silently grows in intensity and that finally explodes into }
<B>__{a soft wail.}
<A>__{tears float around her like tiny satellites. the cold and the gentle humming of the soyuz cradles ryan. she closes her eyes, and as her breathing relaxes she begins to fall asleep, until }
<B>__{click click click.}
<A>__{ryan opens her eyes, startled.}
<B>__{click click click.}
<A>__{ryan turns in confusion and looks at }
<D>__{the porthole }
<A>__{through the glass, the helmet of an astronaut is looking in.}
<B>__{it is matt.}
<A>__{he knocks once more, this time louder.}
<B>__{click click click.}
<A>__{ryan is still drowsy and does not understand what is going on, when she sees that the latch on the porthole begins to move.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{no... no.. don't.}
<A>__{but the latch continues to open. ryan immediately straps herself to the commander chair. the latch keeps turning. ryan covers her eyes and face with her hands when the latch releases and}
<B>__{the hatch swings open.}
<A>__{the vacuum of space sucks in one sharp gust all the air inside the cabin and with it every sound. the straps hold ryan back as objects gush out through the hatch. her hands press tightly covering her face. on the control panel alarms begin to flash. a shadowy figure makes its way in and with one sharp motion turns and closes the hatch. presses a green button and the cabin begins to pressurize. and sound re emerges with the beeping of the alarms as the red orange green graph on the control panel show the atmospheric levels reaching green. ryan uncovers her face and stares from the shadows at the figure, who straps into the seat next to her. he unlocks the ring around his collar and }
<B>__{takes off his helmet.}
<A>__{country western music escapes into the cabin.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{ahhhh! alright, check your watch. 13 hours, 11 minutes. call anatoly, tell him he's been bumped.}
<A>__{the figure glances around.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{bit gloomy in here. how `bout a little light?}
<A>__{he taps a few buttons on the console and a face blooms: matt. ryan stares, mouth agape.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{how did you?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{trust me, it's a hell of a story.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{but how did you?}
<A>__{he reaches out and effortlessly flicks a myriad array of switches. instantly, the alarms go silent.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{that's better.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{how?}
<A>__{ryan looks at him wide eyed, wanting to know how }
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i found a little extra battery power. i'm just happy you're still alive. to be honest, i thought your chances were slim to none. by the way, did you find the vodka?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{you never told me where.}
<A>__{matt fishes a small flask from under his seat, spins off the cap...}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{oh well... to anatoly! na zdorovje.}
<A>__{...and takes a big gulp. he offers the flask to ryan, who appears to be dozing off. she blinks, shakes her head.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{he studies her.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{no? right, let's get out of here.}
<A>__{he looks at the monitors, where the chinese station is seen.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{we're `bout a hundred miles to the chinese station. a little sunday drive.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{we can't.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{course we can.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{there's no fuel. i tried everything.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{well, there's always something we can do.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i tried everything.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{did you try the soft landing jets?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{they're for landing so.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{well landing is launching it's the same thing, didn't you learn about that in training?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i never got to land the simulator, i told you.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{but you know about it.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{and i crashed it every time.}
<A>__{ryan is falling asleep. matt studies her as she dozes off.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{listen you want to go back or do you want to stay here? i get it, it's nice up here, you can just shut down all the systems turn out all the lights, and just close your eyes and tune out everybody.}
<A>__{matt starts flipping through buttons on the console, turning the cabin lights off.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{there's nobody up here who can hurt you, it's safe. then what's the point in going on, what's the point of living?}
<A>__{when the cabin is in darkness, he turns and looks at ryan.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{your kid died, doesn't get any rougher than that, but still it's a matter of what you do now. if you decide to go that you've gotta just get on with it, sit back enjoy the ride. you have to start living life, ryan.}
<A>__{ryan is having trouble keeping her eyes open.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{how did you get here?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{ryan, you have to learn to let go ... hey?}
<A>__{ryan is almost sound asleep.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{ryan is asleep.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{it's time to go home.}
<A>__{her eyes snap open. her gaze shifts. the flask is floating in front of her. but no matt. she turns. the cabin is empty. she turns back.}
<B>__{click click click.}
<A>__{ryan notices that the gate of the ventilation duct is shaking, making a percussive sound. a soft cool light shines in through the condensation that has frozen on the glass. it is the moonlight caressing ryan's face.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{landing, landing. landing is launching.}
<A>__{with a new surge of determination she turns on the cabin light. she pulls the helmet floating above her and puts it on. she connects the umbilical to her suit, opens the oxygen valve, and begins to breath. as the oxygen flows back into her brain a new surge of determination brightens her face. she opens the valves of the other two umbilicals, allowing oxygen to flow, pressurizing the cabin. she grabs the manual.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{okay, landing, landing, landing is green.}
<A>__{she opens the green binder and browses through its index.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{okay, okay landing, alright.}
<A>__{she stops, turns some pages and stares closely at the manual. ryan notices the energy bar floating by her. she grabs it and as she opens the wrapper, she stares intently at one page of the manual, where there is }
<D>__{a diagram }
<A>__{an illustration of the soyuz capsule two meters before landing and hitting the ground. a thrust is shooting out from under its bottom, cushioning its fall: the soft landing engines.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{soft landing jets trigger automatically at three meters before landing. ... you're a clever son of a bitch matt. so to land i need to get rid of the bo and engine module, okay?}
<A>__{she puts on the communication headset.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{listen to me matt. you're going to see a girl with brown hair. she's sarah, her hair is probably a mess. that's okay, she doesn't like to brush it.}
<A>__{she looks out of the porthole, down at earth.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{tell her mommy found her red shoe. she was so upset about that shoe matt, but tell her it was right under the bed.}
<A>__{she turns back to the console and places her finger over one of the buttons.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{you give her a big hug and a kiss for me and tell her mamma misses her. tell her she's my little angel and that she makes me so proud, so so so proud, and that i promise i will try and make her proud too. you tell her that i'm not quitting, that i'm going to keep fighting. you tell her i love her matt... i love her so much.}
<A>__{ryan smiles, remembering... and then }
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{tri module separation, go...}
<A>__{she presses the button.}
<B>__{outer space.}
<A>__{the locks connecting the three modules of the soyuz release. control cabin, airlock, and the engines separate. a mechanism pushes the control cabin away from the airlock and the engines, and it slowly gains distance from them.}
<B>__{control cabin.}
<A>__{ryan scans through the complicated charts and diagrams in the manual.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{okay houston, here comes the tricky part, the soyuz has to think we're only three meters above the earth.}
<A>__{a pause, and then }
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{let's reset you then.}
<A>__{using the manual as a reference, ryan uses the cursors to select the altitude display on the computer screen. the current altitude is 2600 m. she uses the cursors and presses a button. a warning on the computer screen comes on. she presses another button, and on the screen, the altitude goes blank. ryan punches a new set of commands. the altitude now reads 3 meters.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{okay. i only have one shot at this. one shot...}
<A>__{she extends her finger...}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{what's the point if we don't try?}
<B>__{she presses the button. outer space.}
<A>__{a three second thrust ignites at the back of the cabin, pushing it at great speeds toward the chinese station.}
<B>__{soyuz control cabin.}
<A>__{the strength of the thrust pushes ryan back in her seat. she looks at }
<D>__{the periscope }
<A>__{the soyuz is approaching the tiangong. the center of the crosshair is aiming three degrees above the chinese station.}
<B>__{outer space.}
<A>__{the soyuz is making its way rapidly towards the chinese station.}
<B>__{control cabin.}
<A>__{ryan is looking out of the window, at earth }
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{wow... you were right matt... it's magnificent....}
<A>__{she then turns to }
<D>__{the periscope }
<A>__{the chinese station quickly grows in size as the soyuz gets closer and closer. altitude dial 155 km and dropping.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{you're losing altitude, tiangong. you keep dropping and you're going to kiss the atmosphere. but not before i get to you. you have my last ride home.}
<A>__{a new sense of urgency comes up on ryan's face. she unhooks the umbilical from her suit. she unstraps herself. she floats over and looks out of }
<D>__{the porthole }
<A>__{the chinese station is approaching, getting closer. she disarms the emergency exit and holds on to the latch. she pauses and turns to grab the fire extinguisher and holds it tightly against her chest with one arm. with the other arm she reaches for the latch. the station is hovering right next to her and the cabin is going to pass it.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{okay, i'm done with just driving. let's get go home.}
<A>__{she turns the latch, and pyrotechnics shoot the porthole into space. the brutal force of the infinite vacuum of space sucks the air out of the cabin, and ryan is launched out of the cabin at a tremendous speed. she hits her shoulder as she goes through the hatch into }
<B>__{outer space.}
<A>__{a cannonball woman is launched up from the soyuz's hatch. she passes the chinese station as she twirls up toward the heavens. the soyuz continues its straight trajectory toward earth. inside the helmet ryan is stunned from the impact and her shoulder is in pain.}
<D>__{outside }
<A>__{everything twirls. earth and heavens. an alarm in her stopwatch rings. it's been eighty five minutes. and she spins and sees the tiangong, one mile below her. and below it a bright comet leaves behind a yellow scratch over the earth. it}
<D>__{is }
<A>__{the soyuz burning upon contact with the atmosphere. ryan drifts away. she holds tightly to the fire extinguisher with one hand, and with the other she checks her right shoulder.}
<B>__{it hurts.}
<A>__{but there's no time, the tiangong is getting farther away. she points the nozzle of the fire extinguisher away from her and}
<D>__{triggers a spray }
<A>__{it acts like a thrust that pushes her toward the station. it helped, but she is still off target. inside the helmet she is in pain. the glass visor is steaming up. she begins humming as she looks at the station drifting ahead, less than five hundred meters away. from this distance the damage caused to the tiangong by the debris is clear. the solar panels are shredded to pieces, and several modules appear to have been badly hit.}
<D>__{ryan gives another spray }
<A>__{propelling herself even closer to the station. inside the helmet she stops humming. her breath is fogging up the glass, giving her a blurred view of the station, which is less than a hundred meters away. she can}
<D>__{see that }
<A>__{the lifeboat, the shenzhou, a vessel very similar to the soyuz, is docked on a module. it's now clear that she's not flying straight toward the station. ryan attempts to correct her trajectory by giving }
<D>__{another spray }
<A>__{but only a very small thrust comes out of the extinguisher, not enough to push her on the right track. she pulls the trigger again but only a few dust particles come out. the extinguisher is empty. she lets go of it and it floats away. she drifts toward the station, slowly. she is less than twenty meters away, and getting closer.}
<B>__{and closer.}
<A>__{and she misses it by a hair. she drifts, very slowly, two meters above the station. her arm, outstretched, tries to grab hold of anything it can. inside the helmet ryan winces in pain and looks at her outstretched arm reaching toward }
<D>__{the station }
<A>__{she slowly drifts across the modules, the tips of her fingers almost touching the surface of the tiangong. a handle passes under her, almost within reach, but she does not manage to hold onto it. inside the helmet she's struggling, but she knows she's not going to make it. she looks ahead at }
<D>__{the station }
<A>__{a solar panel, following the rotation of the station, comes into view. she stretches out her arm as she gets closer to it. but the solar panel continues its rotation and she is approaching very slowly. the panel is rotating away. she stretches, and she grabs onto a rod on the solar panel, stopping her momentum. ryan hangs from the station. she holds her right arm tightly to her chest. inside the helmet she catches her breath and is clearly in pain.}
<D>__{ryan sees }
<B>__{a lonesome piece of debris.}
<A>__{it hovers above the station and glows as the sunlight hits its surface. it passes very quickly. and there's another one cruising farther above. she pulls her right arm up.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{ahhhhhh!}
<A>__{the pain is excruciating, but she grabs onto the panel's rod,}
<D>__{and }
<A>__{she pulls herself up, and clinging with her leg, she secures herself to the panel. inside the helmet she's panting, and through the fogged up glass she can see, far away over the horizon }
<B>__{bright dots.}
<A>__{pieces of debris burn as they hit the atmosphere. a swarm of incandescent locusts that is coming directly at her. ignoring her pain but using her right arm as little as possible, she climbs up to }
<B>__{the body of the station.}
<A>__{she goes over the module and makes her way across, pulling herself from handle to handle. when she reaches the end of it, with one last big pull she makes it to the hatch that leads into the airlock. with her bad arm she holds onto a handle. with the other, she pulls on the latch and }
<B>__{opens the airlock.}
<A>__{a gust of air bursts out, pushing the hatch wide open. ryan holds on tightly to the handle.}
<D>__{above her }
<A>__{clusters of debris pass by, flying at different distances and at great speeds. pieces collide with each other, exploding into more debris. a big piece of debris is flying downward, missing the station by ten meters as it continues its descent. and }
