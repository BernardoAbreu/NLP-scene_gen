<A>__{brenda has her sleeves rolled up and is doing her job. she enjoys having the responsibility for the whole safe operation of this area. she likes to think of herself as more sophisticated than she is or have others think her more sophisticated. brenda rolls a straw target out from under the lean to shelter and heads for a tripod in the middle distance. there are already two such targets out, a product of her efforts so far. the targets are heavy. this isn't an easy one person job. the camera closes in tighter and tighter on her as she gets closer to setting up the target. in mcu, she lifts a target up. her head is very close to the face of the target. she gets it up, lets the tripod take the weight, and then, just as she lifts her weight back, an arrow streaks into the center of the gold, missing her head by eighteen inches. brenda whips around. we see what she sees: a very cocky ned, standing by the lean to with a bow in his hands and three more arrows knocked simultaneously. he has a feather stuck in his hair. she grabs the arrow and storms at him.}

<D>__{you ever fire one of those bows again, and i will tack you up on the wall to dry.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{god, but i love that sexy talk.}
<A>__{brenda snatches the bow from him, shakes her head and puts the bow down next to a collection of wicked looking arrows.}
