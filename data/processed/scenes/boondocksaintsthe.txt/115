<L>__{interior church confessional booths early morning}
<A>__{smecker wakes up from a drunken stupor. he looks through the slider window at the barely discernible face of the now crying priest.}
<C>__{smecker}
<P>__{(slurred, loud)}
<D>__{hello? you there?}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{y yes my son.}
<C>__{rocco}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{do your thing father. don't fuck this up.}
<C>__{priest}
<P>__{(whispering to rocco)}
<D>__{what do you want me to say?}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{just be natural, goddamit.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{how long since your last confession, my son?}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{oh, christ, uh, i've never confessed.}
<A>__{the priest can hear connor and rocco whisper, but smecker cannot.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{according to the dogma of the catholic church, i should probably burst into flames right here in this booth. but i've come here for advice, not salvation.}
<A>__{connor and rocco stop and listen now.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?}
<C>__{smecker}
<P>__{(ponderous)}
<D>__{why have i come to a church? i never have before. i guess i just... felt i should.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{what is it my son?}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{it's ethics. i put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. i've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. as if they have god's permission. but what they do is wrong and i should arrest them... technically.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{god's permission? god doesn't...}
<A>__{rocco shakes the priest.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{but in this day and age i believe what they do is... necessary. i feel it is... correct.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{you believe?}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{you feel?}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{you feel? a soul is what gives you feelings. happiness, guilt, right or wrong. it is a conduit through which the lord speaks to us. you felt that your answers would be here in the house of god today. you feel these men are necessary. the lord has spoken to you twice this day.}
<A>__{rocco and connor show their individual looks of surprise.}
<C>__{smecker}
<P>__{(sarcastically)}
<D>__{has he now?}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{you have entered the house of the lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. is it so much to believe that god has brought you here?}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{i guess not.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{it is easy to be sarcastic about religion. it is harder to take small hints from god, your feelings and listen to them... to take a stand.}
<A>__{the look of surprise on rocco and connor's faces show that the priest is doing a hell of a job.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{you're right.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{i want to stand for what i believe in, father.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{then you must find out what your beliefs are.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{i believe these young men are right.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{you know them personally?}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{no. they would never do that.}
<A>__{the priest starts to show signs of anger as he starts turning to rocco.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{well, the two irish guys wouldn't. but the italian guy, he might. he's kind of an idiot.}
<A>__{fear returns to the priests face. rocco presses the gun hard to the priests head and jostles him.}
<C>__{rocco}
<P>__{(whispers to priest)}
<D>__{goddam right, i am.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{i'm beginning to see. i've been doing my job... well for fifteen years and it's just not enough. all the things i wish i could do, these guys are doing. millions of dollars in tax payers' money wasted on shit like wire taps and surveillance. theses boys go in and take care of it for the price of a bullet.}
<P>__{(looks up)}
<D>__{ww what do you think i should do? because i'm a law man.}
<A>__{rocco jostles the priest again.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{the laws of god are higher than the laws of man.}
<C>__{smecker}
<P>__{(the clouds have lifted)}
<D>__{yes! yes! i was thinking that, too. no. i was feeling it. all i needed was to hear you say it! amen! i will help them.}
<C>__{priest}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{forgive me father.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{thank you, father, thank you.}
<P>__{(he attempts the sign}
<D>__{of the cross but}
<P>__{screws it up)}
<D>__{whatever. goodbye, amen.}
<A>__{smecker exits and they all let go after a brief pause. rocco turns and starts fixing up the priest's ruffled suit.}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{i wouldn't have, uh, killed you, father.}
<P>__{(signs cross)}
<D>__{dominus ominus. remember, you're bound. you can't talk about this... to anyone.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{just go!}
