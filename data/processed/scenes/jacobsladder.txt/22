<L>__{exterior brooklyn streets evening}
<A>__{jacob is walking down nostrand avenue. he is singing to himself and imitating al jolson.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{when there are gray skies, i don't mind the gray skies, as long as there's you ...}
<A>__{he hums. it is near dusk and lights are just coming on. the shop windows have a particularly garish look about them. the mannequins are dressed in inexpensive, almost tawdry, clothes and have a pathetic appearance. a few shops have set up their christmas decorations. the ornamentation seems strangely out of place; almost blasphemous. jacob passes a street gang standing in the doorway of a local drug store. they chortle and make taunting sounds.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(shaking her tits, singing)}
<D>__{"hey, mr. postman ... "}
<A>__{jacob stops and stares at them. to their surprise, he begins to sing with them. he knows the words. they like that. it is a sweet moment. jacob continues walking. he comes to a cross street. the light is green. he is still singing to himself and does not notice a black car sharging around the corner. the car is moving at full speed, heading straight toward him. a young man walking a few steps behind yells out.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{look out!}
<A>__{jacob turns and sees the car. he scoots out of the way but it swerves in his direction. the young man calls out again.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{jump!}
<A>__{with a huge thrust, jacob hurls himself onto the curb as the car shoots by. two men are peering at him from the back seat. they are laughing like madmen and shaking their heads. they do not look human. jacob yells and waves his fist, to no effect. after a moment he turns to thank the young man whose scream had saved him, but he is gone.}
