<L>__{interior police car night}
<A>__{ronnie sits in the unmarked police car with detective harrison.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{it's like it was meant to be. you behind the wheel. me riding shotgun. two brothers of the badge unite to form the ultimate crime stopping combo. i'm psyched to be here, harrison. thank you for the opportunity.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{you requested to ride along with me.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i know. you want to know the truth. it's because i respect you. see, when we're at the mall, it's obviously my turf. sure, i break your balls about being a rookie, but out here in the streets, i'm the rookie. i'm here to learn. teach me.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{why do you want to become a cop?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i've wanted to be a police officer all my life.}
<C>__{ronnie }
<D>__{don't get me wrong, i love keeping the mall safe, but you guys are the ones that really enforce justice and protect, not just our mall, but our whole community. i don't tell the guys on my squad this, but the security guard job was just temporary.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{well, just pay attention tonight and make sure you stay out of the way.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{right, we're not back at the station anymore so we can cut the charade.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{well, i know that policy demands i stay out of the way, but between you and me, i just want you to know that if anything pops off tonight, i'm going to jump right in there and take 'em down with you.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{no, no. ronnie, policy says you have to stay in the car.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i get you. you have to say this in order to keep you safe 'legally' speaking. i should probably follow along too. 'i swear i won't get out of the car and fight justice tonight.'}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{ronnie, you really can't.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{ronnie winks at detective harrison. a smile comes across harrison's face.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{i'm glad we understand each other.}
<A>__{detective harrison puts the car in drive and the guys head off for the night.}
