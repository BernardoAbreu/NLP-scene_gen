<L>__{interior deacon's bedroom night}
<A>__{deacon bolts up out of bed. nightmare. thank god.}
<L>__{interior basement set as "movie theater" day}
<A>__{deacon enters and the scene looks very much like the dream: ashley on the bed and matt and fred waiting around. the set is made up to look like a movie theater, complete with rows of seats, a bed sheet "screen," and a massive 5,000 watt light. deacon is still a little agitated.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{where the hell is coop? there's no way i'm making out with fred.}
<A>__{then coop comes out of the bathroom and sees everyone staring at deacon.}
<C>__{coop}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{deacon is talking about making out with fred.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{no way. i'm holding the mike and that's it.}
<C>__{coop}
<D>__{i thought we were doing straight porn.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{if you guys want to do gay porn, you still have to pay me.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{hang on. relax. it was just this stupid dream i had.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you dreamed about making out with fred?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{no. well, yes. and we were both having sex with you. but it was just a dream so let's forget it.}
<A>__{everyone is a little uneasy at this admission. deacon quickly changes the subject.}
<C>__{deacon }
<D>__{what's with the light?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{it's a "special effect." if you want this film to look amateurish, you're going to have to get someone else to do it.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{okay. relax.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{come on. let's do it already.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{action.}
<A>__{matt starts his cheesy "projector light effect" and coop takes a seat next to ashley.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{this summer tent pole event movie is making me so scared.}
<C>__{coop}
<D>__{hide your head down here and i will tell you when it's safe to come up.}
<A>__{as she starts to go down, we turn our attention... on fred and deacon, away from the action.}
<C>__{fred}
<P>__{(snide; whispers)}
<D>__{how's naomi?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{fine.}
<C>__{coop }
<D>__{not yet. this is the really scary part.}
<C>__{deacon}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{hey. can i ask you a question?}
<A>__{fred shrugs. the memory of the nightmare is wreaking havoc with deacon's conscience.}
<C>__{deacon }
<D>__{do you ever think maybe we've gotten ourselves in a little over our heads with all of this?}
<C>__{coop }
<D>__{oh, baby. not yet.}
<A>__{fred appears to be pondering the question deeply. his face slowly contorts to a look of seeming anguish. then,}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{fire!}
<A>__{the coiled cord to the massive light is burning a circular hole in the smouldering carpet.}
<C>__{coop}
<D>__{unplug the light!}
<A>__{deacon moves to unplug it.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{wait, it's hot!}
<A>__{too late. deacon touches the cord, screams, and reels back, knocking the light over. it explodes onto the floor. the carpet bursts into flames.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{run!}
<A>__{ashley and coop run up the stairs. fred isn't far behind.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{quick, get the fire extinguisher!}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{where is it?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{over there!}
<A>__{he spots it in the corner and grabs it. meanwhile the flames are growing. deacon comes over and aims the extinguisher at the flames. he depresses the lever. nothing.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{it's not working!}
<A>__{matt thinks about it for a second.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{oh. me and fred used it when we wrote the foamy cat fight script last week.}
