<A>__{jay and silent bob sit close to each other, staring at suzanne (the orangutan) who sits on a log across from them, staring back.}

<D>__{this is jussy's monkey}
<P>__{(to suzanne, angrily)}
<D>__{justice died for you, you monkey fuck!}
<A>__{suzanne covers her eyes with her hands suddenly. jay and silent bob, startle, with jay leaping behind silent bob and pulling back as if he's going to strike.}
<C>__{jay}
<P>__{(to silent bob)}
<D>__{do something. tons of fun!}
<A>__{silent bob offers the ape a weak wave. suzanne drops her hands from her face and waves back. jay cranes his neck to see over silent bob.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{is that fucking thing waving at us?}
<A>__{suzanne nods. jay steps out from behind bob. they state at the ape.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{holy shit? that monkey understood us! maybe it's some sort of super monkey!}
<A>__{suzanne offer them a "raspberry." spitting as if the comment was ridiculous. jay and silent bob react with surprise at this.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{what the fuck was that for? it's not a stupid idea! i seen it in congo?}
<A>__{suzanne holds her nose, as if to say, "congo stunk." silent bob smiles in agreement and amusement. jay looks at him, stung.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{you're my bitch. you get my back. don't go joining this chimp's side.}
<A>__{jay looks around the woods, formulating a thought. silent bob moves toward the ape, extending his hand to shake hers.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{yo what if there's more super monkeys up in the lab? maybe they're making an army of 'em up there! holy shit! maybe it's a conspiracy like on the x files roswell style!}
<A>__{jay's delusion: we enter into jay's head and see }
