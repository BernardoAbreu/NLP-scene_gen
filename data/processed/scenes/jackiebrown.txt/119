<A>__{she walks down the fitting room hallway with changing cubicles on her right, enters the last one. she closes the door and sits down on the bench in between her flight bag full of money and the robinson's may bag. a full length mirror is straight i front of her. she looks at herself... when someone comes into the stall next to her. melanie's voice comes from the other side of the wall.}
<C>__{mealnie }
<D>__{jackie?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{hi, melanie.}
<C>__{melanie }
<D>__{are you getting that black suit?}

<D>__{it looks good on you.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{do you got something for me?}
<C>__{melanie }
<D>__{you betcha.}
<A>__{a robinson's may bag, like jackie's, filled with towels, comes sliding underneath the stall. jackie picks up her robinson's may bag, filled with books, towels and the marked forty thousand dollars. she takes the loose packet of ten thousand marked dollars and lies it on top of the bag. as she does all this melanie continues talking.}
<D>__{melanie (o.s.) (cont'd) we coulda worked this. you know that, dontcha? you would've made out a lot better than you're going to, believe me.}
<A>__{jackie slides the robinson's may bag with money under the stall. melanie sees the money on top and stops talking.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i put a little cherry on top. you're right. what the hell he ever do for us?}
<C>__{melanie }
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{now be careful with that bag. you don't want it ripping open on you in the middle of the store.}
<A>__{we hear the sound of melanie leaving. jackie then transfers the half of a million dollars out of her flight bag into melanie's robinson's may bag. she sticks her uniform in the flight bag. then takes the towels and puts them on top of the money. she grabs her flight bag and leaves, leaving behind the robinson's may bag filled with half of a million dollars.}
