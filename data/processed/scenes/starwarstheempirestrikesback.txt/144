<L>__{exterior dagobah dusk}
<A>__{the mist shrouded x wing fighter is almost invisible in the thick fog. luke climbs out onto the long nose of the spacecraft as artoo pops out of his cubbyhole on the back. the young warrior surveys the fog, which is barely pierced by the ship's landing lights. about all he can make out are some giant, twisted trees nearby. artoo whistles anxiously.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no, artoo, you stay put. i will have a look around.}
<A>__{artoo lets out a short beep. as luke moves along the nose, artoo loses his balance and disappears with a splash into the boggy lake.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{artoo?}
<A>__{luke kneels and leans over the plane looking for artoo, but the water is still and reveals no sign of the little droid.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{artoo! where are you?}
<A>__{a small periscope breaks the surface of the water and a gurgly beep is heard. the periscope starts to move to shore. relieved, luke starts running along the nose of the fighter to its tip.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{artoo! you be more careful.}
<A>__{the outline of the shore is now more than ten feet away. luke jumps off the plane into the water, scrambles up to the shore, and turns to look for artoo. the periscope still steadily moves toward shore.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{artoo that way!}
<A>__{suddenly, through the thick fog layer, a dark shape appears, moving toward the little droid. the dark, sinuous bog beast dives beneath the swampy water, making a loud clunk against artoo's metal hull. the droid disappears from sight, uttering a pathetic electronic scream. holding his ignited lightsaber before him, luke wades a few feet into the murky pool, looking for any sign of his little friend.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{artoo!}
<A>__{the black surface is still as death itself... until a few bubbles begin to appear. then, phheewaat!! the runt size robot is spit out of the water, makes a graceful arc, and comes crashing down into a patch of soft gray moss.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{oh, no! are you all right? come on. you're lucky you don't taste very good. anything broken?}
<A>__{luke helps artoo to his feet and begins wiping the mud and roots from his round metal body. artoo responds with feeble, soggy beeps.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{if you're saying coming here was a bad idea, i'm beginning to agree with you. oh, artoo, what are we doing here? it's like... something out of a dream, or, i don't know. maybe i'm just going crazy.}
<A>__{as luke glances around at the spooky swamp jungle that surrounds him, artoo ejects a stream of muddy water from one of his cranial ports.}
