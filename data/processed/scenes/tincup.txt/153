<A>__{tin cup steps up to his shot.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{this is for venturi, up there in the booth, thinking i should lay up...}
<P>__{(addressing his ball)}
<D>__{dollar bills...}
<A>__{he swings and holds the pose. he caught the ball perfectly it sails high and true into the luffing breeze, the gallery roars, and... ... the ball drops, sploosh! into the water, a couple feet short of dry land. the gallery groans.`}
<B>__{back to tin cup}
<A>__{staring amazed, almost betrayed, that his ball didn't carry the water.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{that's a long fucking ways.}
<P>__{(holds out his hand)}
<D>__{gimme another ball.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{roy...}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{it's a water hazard. you go up there and take a drop. try to save par like you did yesterday.}
<A>__{tin cup's eyes blink with thought as romeo's words get through to him.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{you're right. what the hell was i thinking?}
<A>__{and he starts down to the water. a thunderous ovation greets his approach, and he raises his hat to salute the fans saluting him.}
