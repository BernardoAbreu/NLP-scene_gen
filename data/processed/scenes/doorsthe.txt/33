<L>__{interior london fog night}
<A>__{break on through blasting out at us from a sleazehole half full bikers, sailors, hookers, a baseball game on the tv. a dance floor the size of a bed, the doors on a tiny platform above the bar, london newspapers on the wall.}
<D>__{jim & doors}
<P>__{(live)}
<D>__{we chased our pleasures here dug our treasures there can you still recall the time we cried break on through to the other side}
<P>__{(3)}
<A>__{some groupies have formed a small fan club at the base of the stage, muscling past pam, but most people ignore them, drinking, arguing, dancing to their own fuckbeats. possibly this has something to do with the fact that jim sings with his back to all of them. john looking over furious at ray who mutters under the music.}

<D>__{turn around jim! come on let 'em in.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i found an island in your arms a country in your eyes arms that chained us, eyes that lied}
<P>__{(chorus)}
<A>__{jim jumps around violently to the front, getting the attention of all. rubbing his leather pants against the mike stand, leaning against it, not yet comfortable with the extrovert side of himself, eyes closed, but starting to enjoy it. he sings to pam.}
