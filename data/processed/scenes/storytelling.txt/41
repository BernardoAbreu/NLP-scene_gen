<L>__{interior brady's bedroom evening}
<A>__{marty and mikey sit by the comatose brady, who lies now in his own bed.}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{dad?...do you think that brady will ever get better?}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{one in a million recover.}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{maybe he's that one in a million!}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. it's a very fine line.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{i don't think there's any hope, either. i was just trying to make you feel better.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{you're welcome.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{dad?...would you let me try hypnotizing you now?}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{yeah. sure go ahead. hypnotize me.}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{ok. stay there. i will be right back.}
<A>__{mikey hurries off to fetch his hypnotizing apparatus. marty sits and waits.}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{just a sec!...be right there!}
<A>__{mikey returns, sets himself up across from marty and takes out a shiny object.}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{dad, can you turn around a bit, please?}
<A>__{marty obliges.}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{thanks. all right. now you must look at this shiny object and concentrate. relax your legs. relax your arms. relax your shoulders. now keep your eyes on the shiny object...your eyelids are getting heavy...heavier...you're getting sleepy...sleepier...now let your eyes close shut...and you are asleep.}
<A>__{marty's head drops.}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{now you are completely under my power. i am the only voice you can hear, the only voice you will listen to. now. when you wake up you will be in a good mood. you won't worry so much about brady. and i will be your favorite from now on. if brady dies, you can be sad for a little bit, but i will still be the most important person in your life. you will never be mean to me, and always give me whatever i want. also, you should fire consuelo. she's lazy. now when i snap my fingers, you will remember nothing, but you will do everything i have asked. one. two. three.}
<A>__{mikey snaps his fingers and marty wakes up.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{hey, mikey. you wanna get some ice cream?}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{ok!}
