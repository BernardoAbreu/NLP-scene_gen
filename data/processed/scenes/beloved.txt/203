<L>__{exterior 124 bluestone rd. early evening.}
<A>__{beloved, waiting for sethe to come home, sees her approaching. we hear her thoughts:}
<C>__{beloved }
<D>__{i am not separate from her. there is no place where i stop. her face is my own and i want to be there in the place where her face is and to be looking at it too...a hot thing..in the beginning i could see her. i could not help her because the clouds were in the way. but i could see her. the shining in her ears. i look hard at her so she will know that the clouds are in the way..i cannot lose her again. i see her face which is mine. it is the face that was going to smile at me in the place where we crouched before i come up out of the blue water. sethe's is the face that left me. sethe's sees me in her and i see the smile. she is my face smiling at me. it is the face i lost. now we can join..a hot thing.}
<A>__{sethe comes to the waiting beloved and smiles. she offers her hand and beloved rises. denver exits to them and smiles. she extends her hand to beloved's free hand. the three women stand astride each other, arms around each other's waist as they walk toward the porch... the dusk sunlight creates three shadows three figures holding each other the way sethe saw the shadows at the carnival...only they weren't hers, denver's and paul's...they were hers, denver's and beloved's....}
