<A>__{though mentioned often in the script, the creatures in pitch black are seldom seen at length; rather, they are glimpsed, they are heard, they are felt. they are, really, the embodiment of your nocturnal fears: a howling coyote that jars you awake; the painting on the wall that comes to life when stared at too long...the sway of your bed just before the earthquake hits. chimera of the night. the point is made so the reader appreciates that the focus of the finished film will not be on what the creatures do, but on what the creatures do to reveal the inner nature of the characters. for pitch black is, at its heart, a story of humanity and courage and lack of the same.}
