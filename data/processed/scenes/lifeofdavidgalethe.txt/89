<L>__{exterior starbucks night}
<A>__{david exits the store carrying four large coffees in a cup container, tries to sip one without spilling the others. he's still wearing the radio shack shirt, seems happier. in the parking lot, a hip high schooler jumps out of his camero and moves toward the store. as david comes in front of the car, he sees his former baby sitter sitting in the passenger seat. their eyes meet. he smiles. she smiles back, waves. as he passes, he hears the girl hit the car's automatic door lock button.}
