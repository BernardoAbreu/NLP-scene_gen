<L>__{exterior kirk's home day}
<A>__{picard finds himself standing outside a rustic, but architecturally striking house with spectacular views in the canadian rockies. a hawk is circling overhead, making the crying sound that picard heard. the air is cold, frigid picard can see his breath. picard is just starting to adjust to this sudden change in location when he hears the sound of wood being chopped from around the corner of the house. picard moves to look around the corner and sees james t. kirk. he's still in his uniform and looks exactly as he did the last time we saw him aboard the enterprise b at the beginning of the film. he is vigorously chopping wood with an axe. he's enjoying himself, lost in the sheer pleasure of the manual labor. he's never felt this good in his life. there's no trace of back pain or any other ailment. picard recognizes the famous captain as would any 24 century starfleet officer.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{james kirk.}
<A>__{kirk pauses, looks up at the strange man before him. his expression is wondrous, almost child like. like in picard's christmas sequence, kirk is immersed in the sensual feeling of the nexus. it's like a dream that's over powered him.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{beautiful day, isn't it?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{yes... yes, it is.}
<A>__{kirk points to a nearby log on the woodpile.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{do you mind?}
<A>__{it takes picard a beat before he realizes that kirk wants him to put the log on the chopping block for him.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{picard places the log on the block and kirk gives it a vigorous chop with the axe.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{captain, do you realize what }
<A>__{but kirk interrupts as he sees something o.c.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{wait a second. i think something's burning.}
<A>__{picard follows his look to see smoke billowing out of one of the windows of the house. kirk rushes into the house, and picard follows...}
