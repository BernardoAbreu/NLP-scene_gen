<L>__{6: interior kitchen. house. dawn.}
<A>__{this kitchen was out of date by 1963. a huge china sink and a fat fridge. but the cooker works and a battered old kettle is already on the gas. t shirt and instant coffee. berlin checks cupboards out. crockery includes a cup and that'll do for now. his lips articulate a silent expletive. the gas has just gone out. tries to relight it without success. on hands & knees he explores a rubber supply pipe that snakes under the back door.}
