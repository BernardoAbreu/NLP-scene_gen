<L>__{interior plane day}
<A>__{pamela is hot and bothered trying to wrestle a bulging carpet bag into an overhead locker.}
<C>__{flight attendant}
<D>__{can i help you?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{i'm perfectly capable thank you.}
<A>__{the flight attendant tries to help anyway.}
<C>__{pamela }
<D>__{they've used all the space; so greedy.}
<A>__{she glares at the people around her.}
<C>__{flight attendant}
<D>__{i will take it madam. i can put it up here }
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{i don't want it up there. i want it here, in the corresponding holding area for my assigned seat!}
<C>__{flight attendant}
<D>__{the flight's closing in just a few moments ma'am. i will have to take it.}
<A>__{pamela narrows her eyes at the attendant as if to say `i dare you.' a woman, with an infant, stands up.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(to attendant)}
<D>__{you can put my bag up front instead.}
<A>__{the flight attendant smiles thankfully and replaces the woman's bag with pamela's.}
<C>__{pamela}
<P>__{(to woman)}
<D>__{will the child be a nuisance? it's an eleven hour flight.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(taken aback)}
<D>__{er no, i }
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{jolly good.}
<A>__{pamela gives her a watery smile and takes the seat next to the window, she looks out at the tarmac. she closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, opens her eyes again and tucks her feet tidily together. she folds her hands neatly into her lap and looks straight ahead.}
<C>__{pamela }
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{i hope we crash.}
<A>__{the passenger across the aisle hears her, horrified!}
