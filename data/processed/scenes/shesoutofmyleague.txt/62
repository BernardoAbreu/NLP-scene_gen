<C>__{eric}
<D>__{a little!? are you shitting me? alright, alright! i think we can all agree that debbie here is one wicked hot box.}

<A>__{kirk turns to point up the stairs. as he glances back, he finds molly standing on the steps listening and frowning down at him. before kirk can get a word out, molly storms out of the house. kirk runs upstairs but she's in her car before he can get out the front door. eric appears behind him.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{way to go numbnuts. you should have let me handle it.}
