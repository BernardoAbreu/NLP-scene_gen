<L>__{interior house of pain ballroom dawn}
<A>__{blade has returned to the scene of the melee. the reapers have fled, leaving nyssa and the others to lick their wounds and survey the carnage. quite a few full body ash outlines marking the passing of various vampires. blade approaches nyssa. she notices his wounds.}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{you're hurt.}
<C>__{blade}
<P>__{(brushing off her concern)}
<D>__{i will heal.}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{what about nomak?}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{he escaped. you didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{i didn't know.}
<A>__{beat. tense. does he trust this woman? no way.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{we lose anybody?}
<C>__{nomak}
<D>__{lighthammer and }
<A>__{just then, we hear an unearthly scream.}
<B>__{angle on}
<A>__{priest, being held down by chupa and snowman. he's thrashing about, clutching his wounded, infected arm.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{oh god, oh god it hurts! it hurts, it hurts, fuck, it hurts. ugh!}
<A>__{priest lets loose an agonized scream as blade and the others gather around him. he's undergoing a horrific change, taking on the gaunt, vein engorged features of a proper reaper. he snarls and wails, gnashing his teeth like a rabid animal. reinhardt and his team look uneasy. shaken by their teammate's downward progression.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{how long since he was bitten?}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{minutes.}
<A>__{blade draws closer. already, the flesh on priest's chin is splitting as a seam begins to form.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{it's already changing him }
<A>__{reinhardt paces, annoyed by priest's wailing.}
<C>__{reinhardt}
<D>__{jesus, can't you get him to shut the fuck up!?}
<C>__{nyssa}
<P>__{(gravely)}
<D>__{his blood cells aren't producing oxygen anymore. his own body is suffocating him. these things are like crack addicts. if they don't feed every few hours, they'll feed on themselves.}
<A>__{as if in response, priest starts convulsing. his flesh tightens, drawing taut around his increasingly skeletal form. his screams become unbearable, twisting into a high pitched ululation that's making the bloodpack's skin crawl.}
<C>__{reinhardt}
<D>__{somebody put him out of his misery for fuck's sake!}
<C>__{verlaine}
<D>__{you kill him! i'm not killing him!}
<A>__{asad pulls out his handgun and empties the clip into priest's body but priest keeps shrieking. unnerved, reinhardt unsheathes a machete, decapitating priest even as the others protest. the headless body continues thrashing, still making noise from it's open throat! if anything, it seems to be redoubling its efforts. it lurches forward, jerking itself free from chupa and snowman's restraining arms.}
<C>__{chupa}
<D>__{mierda!!}
<A>__{the juddering horror that used to be priest staggers to its feet. reinhardt and his men panic, stumbling backwards. the headless monstrosity lunges straight at }
<B>__{blade}
<A>__{without batting an eye, he draws his mach pistol, briefly aiming at the on rushing creature's chest, then adjusting his aim to one of the blacked out windows above and behind it. bam!bam!bam! blade shoots out the window and blazing shaft of sunlight slices down through the darkness, spotlighting priest like an ant beneath a magnifying glass. fwash!!! the headless body is incinerated in mid step. it collapses to the floor, just inches before blade. one of its blackened claws feebly grabs blade's boot, then grows still. beat. you could hear the pin drop in the silence that follows, every one of the bloodpack thinking some variation of "there but for the grace of god go i". asad lays a hand on nyssa's shoulder, steadying her. blade shifts his foot, causing the cinder like hand gripping his boot to crumble to dust.}
<C>__{whistler }
<D>__{if this is the best you turd stains have to offer, i'm not impressed.}
<A>__{blade looks over to see whistler, who is just entering. he moves over to him, angry. chupa follows, equally pissed.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{i thought you were supposed to be watching our backs.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{ran into a little reaper trouble myself.}
<C>__{chupa}
<P>__{(approaching, hostile)}
<D>__{oh yeah? like how little? in case you hadn't noticed, we lost two men while you were out farting around.}
<C>__{whistler}
<P>__{(poking chupa in the chest)}
<D>__{you need to ratchet those 'nads of yours down a few notches, paco.}
<A>__{chupa flushes with anger and flicks his knife across whistler's shoulder, opening a gash. whistler goes ballistic and punches chupa in the face. a brief tussle ensues before blade and the others can separate them. as chupa is pulled away by asad, he looks back at whistler.}
<C>__{chupa}
<D>__{listen, hillbilly, you are a cunt hair away from cowboy heaven.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{ain't no thing but a chicken wing, buttercup.}
<C>__{blade}
<P>__{(still suspicious)}
<D>__{where were you, whistler?}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{i will show you.}
