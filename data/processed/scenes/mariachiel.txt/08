<C>__{moco}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{we've got a lot to talk about. i'm just a few town away with a whole new gang. i heard you were nearby so i thought i'd give you a call, amigo.}
<C>__{azul }
<D>__{that's sweet of you, asshole. i don't suppose you could get me out of there, and then maybe hand me over my share of money.}
<C>__{moco}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{yes, i figured you'd want your money, my friend. that is why i have called you. i heard you were getting out soon, and figured i should deal with our situation. but do you really need me to help you get out? from what i hear, you're running quite a business out of your cell with a phone and some loyal men. it keeps you well protected i hear. not a bad idea. i may try that myself sometime.}
<C>__{azul }
<D>__{i could stay in here and earn peanuts compared to what you owe me if i were to get out. so, yes, i want you to help me... my friend.}
<C>__{moco}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{soon my friend, soon. i'm sending you some people in a few days to get you.}
<C>__{azul }
<D>__{really? well, that's more like it. just like the moco i used to know.}
<A>__{azul is walking towards his window at the sound of a truck racing in.}
<C>__{moco}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{just hang in there my friend. i won't forget that you have been a big part of our success. what's wrong.}
