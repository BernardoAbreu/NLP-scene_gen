<L>__{interior confessional night}
<A>__{jam is at the end of his confession. the priest is still listening on the other side of the screen. beth sits in the shadows behind jam.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{so, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that kiss concert right now... together.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{that's it?}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. and not exactly the most interesting one i've ever heard either. you sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{well then, i suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing kiss tickets. i realize this is detroit, but i personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as lucifer's kingdom. i will return in a little while.}
<A>__{the priest slides the door shut again. jam is all but shrouded in darkness, but can make out the time on his watch. it's getting late. he resignedly sits on the bench behind him... right on beth's lap. jam yells, but beth throws her hand over his mouth. his eyes bulge. he can't believe what he's seeing. he climbs off beth and sits next to her.}
<C>__{jam}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{beth? i can't believe it.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{believe it.}
<A>__{jam thinks for a beat. something still isn't quite clicking.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{are you waiting for confession? i thought you were jewish?}
<A>__{beth can hardly speak. she gulps thinking of what to say.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i have a confession. here it is.}
<A>__{beth gives him the biggest, wettest, sloppiest kiss in recorded history. she pulls away finally wiping her mouth.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i didn't mean for that to be so... intense. forgive me.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{i don't care. i wanna hear more.}
<A>__{she lunges at him again, kissing him for dear life. her lips leave his and begin to explore his chin, neck, ear.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i've loved you ever since i first laid eyes on you, jeremiah. i've just always been too scared to show it.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{beth, i can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how i've always felt about you... call me jam. it's my band name.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{you don't know how long i've been waiting to hear that... jam!}
<A>__{he kisses her neck. unable to stop, they start undressing each other, both breathing heavy.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{we've got to take this slow...}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{right, slow...}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{oh, screw it!}
<A>__{she tears his tee shirt open with her teeth.}
