<L>__{exterior log chasm day}
<A>__{ide angle: denham, jack, hayes, lumpy, jimmy, preston and the remaining crew have arrived at a dark, vine entangled chasm ... spanning the narrow, but deadly ravine is a single fallen tree. weak sunlight filters through the dark canopy above casting a sickly green hue over the place. ide on: hayes, followed by jimmy, leads the group across the slimy, moss covered log ... the going is treacherous. angle on: denham struggling with the camera ... jack follows hayes ... lumpy helps choy. they put one foot in front of the other, trying not to let the drop unnerve them. angle on: hayes suddenly stops ... tensely scanning the dark ruins on the other side of the chasm ... creepy pov: ... something is watching the men on the log.}
