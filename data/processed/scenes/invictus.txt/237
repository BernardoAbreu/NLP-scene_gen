<L>__{intercut shots of the rugby match :}
<A>__{ with shots of the security arrangements (snipers, lots and lots of uniformed cops inside and out, sniffer dogs etc. all overseen by jason) with shots of the crowd, which, unlike the earlier test against the lions, is completely and passionately united behind the springboks (all commentators talk about the extraordinary passion of the crowd, that day) always returning to the vip box, where something interesting is taking place right behind mandela: linga moonsamy, the rugby scorner, the soccer lover, loses his scowling reserve and gets sucked into the game. when a ball soars between the uprights and everyone in the box groans, linga leans towards hendrick and asks:}
<C>__{linga}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{hendrick}
<D>__{they scored.}
<A>__{when another ball soars between the uprights and the crowd roars, linga asks again:}
<C>__{linga}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{hendrick}
<D>__{we scored.}
<A>__{a third ball through the uprights. before linga can ask:}
<C>__{hendrick}
<D>__{they scored again.}
<A>__{a fourth ball, to the joy of the others in the box.}
<C>__{linga}
<D>__{we scored?}
<C>__{hendrick}
<D>__{ja. we're tied.}
<A>__{a fifth ball through the uprights, and the crowd goes wild.}
<C>__{hendrick}
<D>__{we're up by three.}
<A>__{action on the field, as a wallaby drive combining backs and forwards moves relentlessly towards the springbok try line. six times the drive is stopped by springbok tackling, but the wallabies keep possession and, on the seventh wave of the assault score a beautiful open try, which is converted. a ripple of concern goes through the crowd and the vip box.}
<C>__{linga}
<D>__{they're ahead?}
<C>__{hendrick}
<D>__{by four.}
<A>__{nerves in the box. but not on the field, as pienaar starts a drive with a tackle we feel ourselves, resulting in a change of possession and a stunning, open field try scored in the corner by the springbok wing, who raises his fist in the air, after juking the last wallaby to try and tackle him. the crowd roars. in the vip box, mandela is on his feet, shaking hands with everyone he can reach, including linga and hendrick, and the waiter. the difficult, angled conversion is missed.}
<C>__{linga}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{hendrick}
<D>__{we're only ahead by one.}
<A>__{another penalty kick.}
<C>__{hendrick}
<D>__{we're ahead by four.}
<A>__{a drop goal.}
<C>__{hendrick}
<D>__{by seven.}
<A>__{an incredible try by the springbok fly half.}
<C>__{hendrick}
<D>__{by fourteen.}
<A>__{everyone dares to dream. the classic south african penchant for pessimism begins to abate. two things to note: the crowd roar grows and grows and grows and is echoed in the vip box. even jason turns to look at the action on the field but only for a second. also, this match serves as the coming out party for the springbok fly half, who scores 22 of south africa's 27 points this day. suddenly, a referee's whistle creates pandemonium on the field, in the stands, and in the vip box.}
<C>__{linga}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{hendrick}
<D>__{we won!}
<C>__{linga}
<D>__{we did?}
<A>__{mandela shoots to his feet, pushes his chair away and begins the famous "mandela shuffle" a very cool african boogie that is one of his signature moves. on the mandela shuffle }
