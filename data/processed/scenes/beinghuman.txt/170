<L>__{exterior beach sunset}
<A>__{at the very moment of sunset betsy is trying to capture it in a watercolor sketch. she has set up an easel on the beach. it's like action painting. she works frantically on the picture, racing the sun as it dips into the ocean. tough little betsy can even lose patience with the sun.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{why does it always go so fast...?}
<A>__{thomas is laughing at her. he has seen her attempt this before. hector has other concerns. he is trying to light his barbecue. match after match disappears into his elaborate stone structure, only to fizzle out. the sun finally vanishes, and betsy goes limp at her easel. the sun has won the race again. she and thomas watch hector trying to light the fire. after a while he is conscious of their amused attention on him, then he becomes a little self conscious.}

<D>__{i used to know how to do this...}
<A>__{they laugh a little.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i did... i used to be really good at this...}
<A>__{he wafts and blows ineffectually at a flicker of flame. there's not much of the caveman about him now.}
