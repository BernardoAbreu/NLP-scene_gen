<A>__{for now though, big wooden chocks hold it in place, the whole thing is attached to a heavy chain that coils back around the shed that they just ran through. holmes trails the hulking form of dredger into this network of struts. they weave through the shadows. holmes sees one of the cables shifting slightly. he takes an angle to cut off dredger, and zap! holmes steps into dredger's path, hitting him with the lightning rod, knocking him back. zap!! holmes gives another jolt, but the shaft starts to lose power. dredger knows there isn't much juice left. he reaches out, grabs the weapon and... smiles a terrifying smile. a moment of reckoning between holmes and dredger: the shaft slowly... sizzles... out. dredger tosses the rod. and now, holmes backs away, as dredger grabs a sledgehammer, and swings the hammer at holmes, smashing some of the wooden supports, tearing others out of his way. the ship lurches forward.}
