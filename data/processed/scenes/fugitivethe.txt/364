<A>__{sits in the front car. there are very few other riders. a man with newspaper sits across the car reading. the headlines facing kimble say: "kimble in chicago". kimble's booking photo stares back at him. kimble reacts to the headline, looks away as the man turns the pages. the man looks over the newspaper at kimble, then goes back to reading. a moment later he folds the paper back to the front page. the man looks up from the paper and looks at kimble again, then down. coolly the man folds the paper, tucks it under his arm, stands, looks through the car, then moves into one of the rear cars. kimble looks out the window hoping desperately for his car to reach the station. he keeps his head turned until the man is gone. angle through center of train night from the center of kimble's car we see the man with the newspaper move up to a transit cop. they begin talking. kimble stands, coming into the shot. we see him watching the discussion. suddenly a man, sitting in the rear of the car, stands and blocks kimble's view of the cop. it's sykes. his gun is drawn.}
