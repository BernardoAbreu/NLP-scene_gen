<A>__{tilting down reveal that we are in a park, very green. people are casually dressed, having fun. cycling, reading... children are playing in a playground. beyond the line of tree we see the skyline of washington, d.c., with the capital building and the washington monument. the skyline is subtly changed, with a lot of new buildings, advanced high rises.}

<A>__{we boom down and track laterally through a playground in the foreground. children swinging on swings. sliding down slides. timeless things that 4 decades of technical advancement will not change. as we track we hear:}

<D>__{august 29th 1997 came and went. nothing much happened. michael jackson turned forty. there was no judgment day. people went to work as they always do, laughed, complained, watched tv, made love.}
<A>__{we pass a jungle gym, neither melted nor burned, but full of kids swinging and yelling raucously. past it we drop down to see a boy pumping the pedals of a tricycle.}

<A>__{there is a man in is forties playing with two small children nearby. he turns. it is john connor. through he has the same stern features in adulthood, there is no eye patch, no scarring. he is far from the haggard man on grim destiny we saw in the world that might have been. but there is still penetrating intelligence, even wisdom, in his eyes.}

<D>__{tie me, grandma.}
<A>__{grandma sarah smiles. it is the only time we have seen her smile so far. she bends as the little girls puts her foot up on the bench. she ties as we hear:}
