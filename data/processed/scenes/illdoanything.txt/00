<D>__{"i will do anything" screenplay by james l. brooks}
<C>__{shooting draft}
<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{interior passageway night}
<A>__{the camera briskly retreats as forty, highly charged, attractive, young people march towards it. each side of the frame is black as this troupe of young actors moves up the middle, everyone talking, grinning, squealing,... everyone having the "high" of their lives.}
<L>__{interior new york club night}
<A>__{as the troupe, with geometric precision, spills into a large room (containing a raised dance floor); the camera begins to move past dancing couples as a legend appears: 'this is 1975 and matt hobbs is singled out for the first time.' and now the camera reveals matt hobbs. his open, friendly, american face slips between some of the many cracks in his profession. the face at 26, and forever more, not arresting enough for a leading man; not quirky enough for a "character." matt must briefly walk on the dance floor to make his way past a knot of people. he dances furiously for two seconds, then steps down as the dancers begin to sing "wow", but just as the song breaks out musically, we hear the sound of people shhhing; the singers falter and then stop as the party goers gather, in choreographed movement, at a ceiling mounted tv set.}
<B>__{man on tv}
<A>__{we can barely discern the words. . ."with his review is leonard graff." a frantic actress yelps a command:}
<C>__{frantic actress}
<D>__{i can't hear over this shhing.}
<A>__{silence, then:}
<C>__{tv critic}
<D>__{...a play about guess what? that's right, young people.}
<B>__{on matt}
<A>__{he stands next to a ruggedly handsome and extremely nauseous}
<B>__{contemporary.}
<C>__{handsome contemporary}
<D>__{i can't look.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{good idea, let's not.}
<A>__{he begins to walk, the handsome contemporary falling into step. everyone they pass is straining, upwards, at the tv.}
<C>__{handsome contemporary}
<D>__{how can we not listen to this?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{we'll know all we need to from the reaction.}
<A>__{at that moment, the rest of the party goers turn from the tv as one, looking mugged. (one girl briefly gets our attention because she is particularly distraught; tears streaming down her angry face. the mixture of tears and rage are, of course, the chemical components of incredible sexiness. her name is beth.) a tortured male dancer offers an incantation.}
<C>__{tortured male dancer}
<D>__{he should be shot, he should be dead, he should rot in hell, then come back as the soap cake in a urinal.}
<C>__{handsome contemporary}
<P>__{(to dancer)}
<D>__{he didn't like it?}
<A>__{the director moves through the group, bucking up spirits.}
<C>__{director}
<D>__{don't worry. he doesn't count. we'll just wait for the papers.}
<A>__{on matt and fellow cast members later as they morosely watch the director approach.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{hey, no matter what this review says, the play was a great experience for me.}
<A>__{beth looks at him, puzzled.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(again)}
<D>__{i mean, it is about process, right?}
<C>__{handsome contemporary}
<D>__{matt's right. good lord, it is what we're alive for.}
<A>__{beth turns from the conversation, finding it preposterous, then rivets her attention on the director, walking towards them, holding a ridiculously thick sheaf of papers. beth begins to sob in anticipation.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you've just got to be tougher than this.}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{tougher than this?!?}
<A>__{the director reaches them.}
<C>__{director}
<D>__{i took it all down over the phone. it's quite bad. and, unfortunately, it's very, very long. i've got a broken heart and writers' cramp. he...}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{he's nuts.}
<C>__{director}
<D>__{he savages everyone.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i don't want to hear anymore. let's dance.}
<C>__{director}
<D>__{except you, matt.}
<A>__{they all look at him.}
<C>__{handsome contemporary}
<P>__{(fiercely to matt)}
<D>__{you filthy bastard.}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(drawing closer to matt)}
<D>__{what did he say?}
<A>__{the director hunts for the paragraph.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{don't read it.}
<C>__{other actor}
<D>__{oh, please. you can't wait to run out of here, buy a flashlight, and then go into some dark alley and drool over every word.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(truthfully)}
<D>__{you're wrong. i'm maybe relieved and curious. that's it.}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(wildly exasperated)}
<D>__{what did they say about him?}
<C>__{director}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{...'in the midst of this delirium of pretension...'}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{don't. this divisive crap won't...}
<C>__{director}
<P>__{(again)}
<D>__{'...one actor, rather miraculously, manages to provide passion and, yes, truth. matt hobbs, in the supporting role of jesus, manages to touch the heart long after you thought it numbed by boredom.'}
<A>__{the table of actors look at a sober matt. a long beat and then, against his will, he grins... then a short, involuntary barking laugh of joy... then:}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(to his colleagues with sincerity)}
<D>__{sorry.}
