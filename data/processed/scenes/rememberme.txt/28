<L>__{interior coffee shop. washington square park. day}
<A>__{a student hangout. the place is bustling. numerous nyu students move, sit, eat, lounge. aidan scans the crowd. tyler stands beside him looking far less enthusiastic.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{this is one of those moments i'm already regretting.}
<C>__{aidan}
<D>__{she was here yesterday.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{what am i supposed to say to this girl? "hey doll face, your dad trampled all over my civil liberties, wanna make out?"}
<C>__{aidan}
<D>__{well don't call her doll face.}
<A>__{ally enters. she wears a big sweatshirt. aidan spots her.}
<C>__{aidan}
<D>__{there. the brunette.}
<A>__{tyler watches her settle into a couch with a big cup of coffee.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{i know her. i mean, i don't know her, but, i've seen her. she's in my global politics class.}
<C>__{aidan}
<D>__{there you go! something to open with. now get over there.}
<A>__{tyler sighs, begins toward ally.}
<C>__{aidan}
<D>__{shazam!}
<A>__{tyler glares. aidan gives a big thumbs up.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<A>__{ally briefly looks up from her book.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{my name's tyler roth. i was wondering if i could bother you for a minute?}
<A>__{he gives her a charming smile.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{you're already bothering me.}
<A>__{beat. the smile usually works.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{um, i'm doing kind of a sociological experiment...i was hoping you could help me out.}
<A>__{ally looks at him, a little wearily, holding her place in the book.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{what are you, kidding me?}
<A>__{tyler is genuinely taken aback.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{no, i... may i ask your name?}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{anonymous. it's greek. it means "you don't have a shot".}
<A>__{a surprised laugh escapes from tyler.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{okay, anonymous, do you see the guy across the room, pretending to read a text book, looking in this general direction?}
<A>__{aidan holds a math textbook at an awkward angle to mask his obvious interest in ally and tyler's conversation.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{subtle.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{i have this theory that an objective third party, having no prior contact, would be able to determine how much of an asshole he is just by looking at him.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{ah.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{he's my roommate. and i've witnessed so many glaring examples of assaholic behavior that i'm biased as a subject, but i'm convinced that he has an aura, that people can actually perceive. so, just take a good long look. and tell me what you think?}
<A>__{she looks at aidan, briefly, who shifts to avoid her gaze. then she takes a peek at tyler's profile.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{who else do you plan on asking?}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{no one here. the parameters called only to sample attractive women in their early twenties.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{i'm nineteen.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{in their late teens.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{well, look, you typically get something for participating in these things and i've run out of those big foam fingers, so i was thinking maybe i could take you out some night?}
<A>__{she looks at him.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{or you could just go out with me on the off chance we'd have an interesting conversation.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{i don't date sociology majors... they're a rowdy bunch.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{indeed they are. lucky for you, i'm undecided.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{everything.}
<A>__{tyler smiles. ally tries to hide a smile. she closes her book and extends her hand.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{i'm ally.}
