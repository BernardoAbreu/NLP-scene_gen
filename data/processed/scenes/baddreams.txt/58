<A>__{wasserman slams his hand down on the desk, furious. cynthia jumps, squeezes alan's hand. berrisford sits quietly, leans forward and picks up the pan holder wasserman has displaced.}

<P>__{(sharp, stepping forward)}
<D>__{it was not a delusion! victor lunes was here }

<C>__{wasserman}
<D>__{ a one bedroom flat with a beige rug... that's rather... generic.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{ victor isn't generic }
<C>__{wasserman}
<D>__{victor is dead! dead for fifteen years }
