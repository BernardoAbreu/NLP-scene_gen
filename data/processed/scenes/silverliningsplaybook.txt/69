<D>__{listen, i haven't dated since before my marriage so i don't really remember how this works.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{how what works?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{i saw the way you were looking at me, pat. you felt it, i felt it, don't lie. we're not liars like they are. i live in the addition around back, which is completely separate from my parents' house, so there's no chance of them walking in on us. i hate the fact that you wore a football jersey to dinner because i hate football, but you can fuck me if you turn the lights off, okay?}
