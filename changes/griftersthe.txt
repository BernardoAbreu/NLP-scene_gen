<LOC>__{EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY}
<ACTION>__{AN ANGLE establishing the race track, Ruidoso Downs (pronounced Ree-oh-do-so), set among the beautiful mountains of New Mexico's Lincoln National Forest, as a white Chrysler turns in with a stream of cars moving toward the parking area. AN ANGLE through the open driver-side window of the Chrysler at LILLY DILLON, 39 but looking younger, beautiful but cold and watchful. WIDE SHOT, track in b.g. as Lilly parks the Chrysler, gets out, locks the car. As she walks toward the track, WIPE RIGHT, as SCENE TWO WIPES IN from the left. SCENE ONE CAMERA FOLLOWS Lilly as she walks across the large parking area.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{SPLIT SCREEN.}
<TRANS>__{SCENE TWO:}
<LOC>__{EXT. SIDE STREET - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Downtown Los Angeles, near the courts and the business section. ROY DILLON, 25, handsome and charming but self indulgent, parks his orange Honda convertible, gets out, picks up a large ledger book from the back seat, goes around to open the trunk. AN ANGLE on the trunk, establishing the tools of the salesman's trade: catalogs, samples, ledgers full of manuals and product sheets. Roy adds the ledger from the back seat, shuts the trunk, walks away.}
<LOC>__{EXT. 6TH STREET - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Roy walks around the corner near a bar/restaurant. As he approaches it, WIPE LEFT, the two half-width scenes contracting to one-third each as SCENE THREE WIPES IN from the right. SCENE ONE: Lilly approaches the track's entrance doors. SCENE TWO: Roy approaches the bar.}
<TRANS>__{SCENE THREE:}
<LOC>__{EXT. SANTA MONICA BOULEVARD - DAY}
<ACTION>__{A baby blue Cadillac parks in front of a jeweler. AN ANGLE on the driver's door as MYRA LANGTRY, 36, beautiful in an impersonal calculating way, gets out, carrying a small jewelry care, and locks the car. At first glance, Myra looks rather like Lilly. (Myra always wears large dangly earrings, and usually wears big-lensed dark sunglasses.)}
<TRANS>__{SIMULTANEOUSLY:}
<ACTION>__{SCENE ONE: Lilly enters the track. SCENE TWO: Roy enters the bar. SCENE THREE: Myra enters the jeweler's. WIPE RIGHT AND LEFT, as SCENE TWO takes FULL SCREEN.}
<LOC>__{INT. BAR - DAY}
<ACTION>__{AN ANGLE on a hurried bartender in a full bar, crowded with a NOISY lunchtime crowd. In b.g., Roy slithers his way to the bar, waving a bill in the air to attract the bartender's attention. AN ANGLE on Roy as the bartender comes to him. Roy puts the bill on the bar, holding it down with one finger, as he SHOUTS his order. The bartender looks down. BARTENDER'S POV: Roy's finger holds down a twenty dollar bill. AN ANGLE steep over Roy's shoulder, the twenty visible, as the bartender hurries away to get the drink. Roy's hand makes a fist, swallowing the twenty, opens, pushing a ten out onto the bar, holding it there with one finger. AN ANGLE on the bartender returning with a draft beer, nodding to other ORDERS shouted to him along the way, putting the beer down, grabbing the bill without looking at it, hurrying away. AN ANGLE on Roy, content, smiling, sipping his beer. AN ANGLE on the bartender, hurrying by, slapping Roy's change down, moving on, Roy nodding acknowledgement, reaching out. CU, the change, a ten dollar bill on top. Roy's hand closes over it.}
<LOC>__{EXT. TOTE BOARD - DAY}
<ACTION>__{WIDE SHOT, the tote board at the track, showing the shifting odds on the horses for the next race, the amounts bet. CLOSE SHOT, number 3. Not much bet, odds 70-1.}
<LOC>__{EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY}
<ACTION>__{AN ANGLE on Lilly, frowning at the tote board. She carries a large heavy shoulder-bag, which she opens, looking in it as though it were a file drawer. AN ANGLE on Lilly studying the contents of her bag, the track beyond her, the mountains visible out beyond the track wall. Lilly moves. AN ANGLE on a high-dollar betting window, as Lilly approaches, taking bank-banded wads of bills from her bag.}

<ACTION>__{A change of numbers sweeps across the board.}

<LOC>__{INT. JEWELER'S OFFICE - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Very quiet, stately; abrupt contrast with the track. A slow ticking clock. Myra sits in the client's chair, while at the desk sits the JEWELER, a pleasant but overweight man of 40, who studies a jeweled bracelet through a loupe. He sighs, drops the loupe, shakes his head regretfully.}
<CHAR>__{JEWELER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<LOC>__{INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY}
<ACTION>__{An expensive hotel room, with a sunstruck day beyond the windows. Myra, naked, a few years younger, sits cross-legged on the bed and laughs at COLE "FARMER" LANGLEY, 55, stringy bodied, who stands naked, his back to us, hands on hips, presenting himself to Myra. She reaches forward, hand hidden by his body as she lifts something that was hanging on something at the front of him. She brings back the bracelet, looks at it, is delighted, puts it on, and then leans forward again toward the unmoving Cole, her head hidden by his body.}

<ACTION>__{He leaves the room. Myra grimaces, in almost physical pain.}
<LOC>__{INT. SECOND BAR - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Another crowded lunchtime bar. A big beefy BARTENDER moves quickly, carrying a draft beer. AN ANGLE on Roy, in position, finger holding bill down, as the bartender arrives, puts down the beer, reaches for the bill, stops, stares at the bill. TWO SHOT, the bartender and Roy, as the bartender gives Roy a very cold look. He knows, and Roy knows he knows. Roy tries an innocent smile, which doesn't work. Roy moves. CU, the ten dollar bill, as Roy grabs it, but the bartender simultaneously grabs Roy's wrist. AN ANGLE on Roy and the bartender as Roy tries to pull away and the bartender holds him with his left hand while reaching under the bar with his right. He comes up with a sawed-off baseball bat. Roy, seeing it, throws his free arm up to protect his head, but the bartender pushes the blunt end of the bat straight across the bar at a downward angle and hard into Roy's solar plexus, driving the air out of him and propelling him back away from the bar, leaving the ten. The nearest CUSTOMERS on both sides become aware that something happened, but nothing follows and they're already involved in conversations. The bartender scoops up the ten as he puts the bat away under the bar. AN ANGLE on Roy, arms folded across his torso, staring in shock toward the bar, where the space he filled has already been closed in by other bodies. Nearly retching, he stumbles toward the door.}
<LOC>__{EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY}
<ACTION>__{AN ANGLE on four PEOPLE at a table, CHEERING a race, switching to disgust and despair when they lose, moving away from the table, leaving their betting tickets behind. Lilly passes by, smoothly and casually scoops up the tickets, moves on along a row of tables, and there finding more tickets.}
<LOC>__{INT. JEWELER'S OFFICE - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Myra sits as before. The jeweler enters with a check, which he hands her. She looks up at him, making no move to leave.}

<DIAL>__{I have only one thing now. Are you interested?}
<CHAR>__{JEWELER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{JEWELER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I see.}
<ACTION>__{He turns away, goes behind his desk, sits down, looks at Myra.}
<CHAR>__{JEWELER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You know something, Mrs. Langtry? A bracelet like that very rarely happens. A fine setting and workmanship usually mean precious stones. It always hurts me when I find they're not. I always hope --}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(faint sad friendly smile)}
<DIAL>__{-- I'm mistaken.}
<ACTION>__{Myra likes him better now, even though he hasn't solved her problem. She rises.}
<CHAR>__{MYRA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thank you. For everything you felt you could do.}
<LOC>__{EXT. STREET - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Roy has been throwing up but is finished now. He's sprawled like a shot deer across the hood of his Honda, still clutching his stomach. A police car stops, the passenger COP gets out. He's suspicious at first.}
<CHAR>__{COP} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sir? Everything all right?}
<ACTION>__{The sight of the uniform forces Roy into gear. He straightens, smiling through his pain.}

<DIAL>__{Oh, I will.}
<LOC>__{EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Late afternoon. AN ANGLE on the parking area, where almost all the cars are gone and the few remaining are widely separated. The white Chrysler is one of these. Lilly walks to it from the track entrance. AN ANGLE on the Chrysler as Lilly opens the trunk, puts her bag inside. CLOSE UP, Lilly and the trunk. She takes betting tickets from her bag, sorts them, files them in envelopes in different compartments, puts some to one side, then sorts through these separated tickets, throwing some away, keeping some. She takes money from the bag, puts tickets in, closes the bag with the money on the trunk floor. Reaching farther in, she lifts the pad deep inside the trunk, lifts the metal floor panel, and reveals a cache mostly filled with money. She adds today's skim, puts everything away, puts the bag back on her shoulder, closes the trunk.}
<LOC>__{EXT. MADERO APARTMENTS - DAY}
<ACTION>__{A shabby apartment hotel on Wilshire. An exterior hall balcony on each floor has the entrance doors to the front apartments. Roy's Honda makes the turn and enters the basement garage.}
<LOC>__{INT. MADERO LOBBY - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Modest but clean. The owner, SIMMS, a sloppy garrulous old bore, talks with a potential RENTER.}
<CHAR>__{SIMMS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Put it this way, now. Say I rent to a woman, well, she has to have a room with a bath. I insist on it, because otherwise she's got the hall bath tied up all the time, washing her goddamn hair and her clothes and everything she can think of.}
<ACTION>__{In b.g., Roy, still in pain, comes out of the elevator, waves to Simms, who waves back without pausing in his monologue, and crosses to the mailboxes.}
<CHAR>__{SIMMS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Now, your minimum for a room with bath is three hundred a month, just for a place to sleep and no cooking allowed. And just how many of these tootsies make that kind of money and have to eat in restaurants and buy clothes and --}

<CHAR>__{SIMMS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I had my first hotel thirty-seven years ago in Wichita Falls, Texas, and that's where I began to learn about women. They just don't make the money, you see, not regular they don't, and there's only one way they can get it.}
<ACTION>__{Roy enters the elevator.}
<CHAR>__{SIMMS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Now, that Mr. Dillon there, that's the fine type of person I have in mind for here. Like yourself, I have no doubt. He's a salesman, regular as clockwork, has a suite here. Fine man. Now, about these women. At first, you know, they just go out and do it now and then, just enough to make ends meet. But pretty soon they got that bank open twenty-four hours a day, and then you've got trouble. Hookers and hotellin' just don't mix. You'd think the cops'd be too busy catching real criminals, not snooping around after working girls, but that's the way the gravy stains, as the saying is, and I don't fight it. An ounce of prevention is my motto.}
<ACTION>__{Myra enters from the front, looks across at Simms, points upward. Simms calls to her.}
<CHAR>__{SIMMS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, yes, Mrs. Langtry, he's up there, he's expecting you.}

<LOC>__{EXT. ROY'S APARTMENT - DAY}
<ACTION>__{AN ANGLE along the balcony, with Roy's apartment door in f.g. and Los Angeles in b.g. Myra crosses to the door, opens it with her key, enters.}
<LOC>__{INT. BATHROOM - DAY}
<ACTION>__{A small crowded old-fashioned bathroom. Roy, shirt open and trousers pushed down almost to his crotch, looks in the mirror at purplish greenish bruises on his stomach. He touches his stomach, winces.}

<ACTION>__{He leaves the bathroom.}
<LOC>__{INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Hotel furniture, shabby and anonymous. On the walls, contrasting with everything else, are two crying-clown pictures on black velvet, mounted in big boxy frames. Myra stands in the middle of the room, and Roy enters, shirt and trousers still disarranged.}

<DIAL>__{I'm done here. Do I come back to Baltimore?}
<LOC>__{INT. OFFICE - DAY}
<ACTION>__{It could be an expensive, if gaudy, lawyer's office. Baltimore harbor is visible past the windows. IRV, the accountant, sits at a desk covered -- but neatly covered -- with ledgers, computer printouts, etc. He speaks on the phone.}

<ACTION>__{Myra, dressed, primps at the mirror, surveys herself critically, is reasonably satisfied, leaves.}

<ACTION>__{AN ANGLE across Roy's profile, with open bedroom door beyond him. Through it, the living room and outer door can be seen. Myra crosses the living room, opens the door. Bright sunlight pours in, emphasizing the sweat on his face. She closes the door, and he gives up trying to smile. Gingerly, he touches his bruised stomach, winces.}
<CHAR>__{ROY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Damn that guy.}
<ACTION>__{He's going to get out of bed, but movement creates pain. He sits back against the headboard, looks around, reaches painfully to the bedside table drawer, takes a quarter from it, studies the quarter, feels it with fingertips, places it on the back of his left hand, slowly moves the soft pads of his right palm over it, then turns the quarter over and repeats. Then he takes the quarter in his right hand, flips it, slaps it down onto the back of his left hand, SPEAKS simultaneously with the hands coming together.}

<ACTION>__{He's about to repeat when a wave of weakness comes over him. He sits back, gasping, but won't acknowledge the problem. He forces himself to flip the coin, misses catching it, finds it on the blanket, flips it again, slaps it onto the back of the other hand, looks away.}
<CHAR>__{ROY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<LOC>__{INT. PASSENGER TRAIN - DAY}
<ACTION>__{The train runs through a forest, tree shadows making a light and-dark pattern. Roy, four or five years younger, sits with a three-core-monte gang, consisting of a DEALER, a spectacled SHILL beside him, Roy facing the dealer, a ROPER next to Roy. On a briefcase on the dealer's lap are three cards, face up: An ace and two deuces. Across the aisle, alone in the seats, sits MINTZ, a conman in his fifties, pretending not to watch, but watching with amusement.}

<ACTION>__{The dealer turns aside, allowing himself to be distracted. He and the shill ARGUE nonsensically. The roper nudges Roy, then reaches out and crimps the ace. Roy's doing a wide-eyed bumpkin kid; he stares at the roper in delight and amazement. AN ANGLE on the shill, arguing with the dealer but looking toward Roy and the roper, then increasing the force of his argument. AN ANGLE across the amused Mintz at the roper whispering to Roy. TWO SHOT, Roy and the roper.}

Lilly, shoving money away with her hands now, stares at him, willing it not to happen. He stops moving. His eyes dull. Lilly clasps her arms around herself. She knows she doesn't dare scream. Lips drawn back in a snarl, teeth clenched, she HISSES her agony through her teeth. She HISSES; she HISSES; she HISSES. Then, slowly, she regains control. WIDE SHOT as Lilly gets to her feet. She seems dazed now, like someone who's just been in a traffic accident. She blunders around the room, kicks the attache case, bends to pick it up.

Finishing, she closes the case, then remains on her knees, bending over the case. She WEEPS grindingly. WIDE SHOT, entrance door in b.g. Lilly's weeping subsides. She gets wearily to her feet, and leaves the room. CAMERA HOLDS. SOUND of water running in sink. SOUND STOPS. Lilly reappears. She does not again look toward Roy.
