<A>__{he is knocking off his tequila and looking at the girl hungrily. she is doing her swaying dance, playing up to him and with unmistakable effect. he sloshes another drink into his glass and, never taking his eyes off her, downs it.}
<L>__{interior the cantina full shot another angle the dance}
<A>__{beyond estrella we see ethan, emilio, and mose at the bar gestures, headshakes, the entire pantomime of an inaudible conversation. then ethan takes out his pouch and begins dropping gold pieces into emilio's hand. meanwhile, dance and dancer are achieving their purpose with martin. and the tequila is working. he gets to his feet, a little groggily. estrella's smile deepens and there is a clear invitation in her eyes... ethan turns then, his deal with emilio concluded, and he sees what is going on. he starts for martin's table just as martin moves out to take the girl.}
