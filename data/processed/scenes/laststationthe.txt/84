<L>__{exterior yasnaya polyana. pond. day}
<A>__{sofya has reached the bathhouse. peasant women watch her as they do their wash. she glances back her pursuers, races on. tiring now, she goes to her knees. she crawls along the jetty toward the water. at the edge of the jetty, she falls on her back then turns over, most ungracefully, and rolls off sideways into the pond. high angle. sofya sinks into the black water. the sound of her rescuers fades away and is replaced by tolstoy's voice, reading the farewell note she still clutches in her hand.}
<C>__{tolstoy }
<D>__{my position in the house has become intolerable. what i'm doing now is what people have commonly done leave their worldly life behind to spend their last days in peace and solitude.}
<A>__{slow motion she floats, strangely relaxed, beneath the water.}
<C>__{tolstoy }
<D>__{i beg you to forgive me for everything i've done to you, just as i forgive you with all my soul for everything you've done to me.}
<A>__{the silence is suddenly ripped apart by the rescuers. sasha and valentin jumping into the pond. sasha, barely able to swim herself, thrashes in the water.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{sasha, go back to the jetty. here, let me help you.}
<A>__{he offers his arm, using it to push her to safety.}
<C>__{sasha}
<D>__{no! she's drowning. help her!}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{i will. i will. stay here.}
<A>__{with that, he pushes away from the dock and makes a sharp plunge under the water. sasha watches, waits...and after a long moment valentin surfaces pulling sofya with him. on the dock, the servants and sasha help him to get her heavy body , water soaked dress, back onto the bank. she looks terrible. her tongue lolling out, water drizzling from her open mouth. sasha is overcome.}
<C>__{sasha}
<D>__{she's dead. my mother. she's dead.}
<A>__{ivan takes action. he rolls her on to her stomach, works to expel water from her lungs. this goes on for an agonizing length of time. valentin looks to the sky... dull and gray. then a sound, coughing sputtering. she is alive. sasha, valentin, and the servants help up.}
<C>__{sasha}
<D>__{let me take you to the house, mother.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{let me die. please. why would you rob me of that?}
<C>__{sasha}
<D>__{let's go to the house.}
<A>__{sofya is suddenly clear, almost calm.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{ivan, go to the station. find out which train the master took.}
<A>__{ivan looks at sasha for approval.}
<C>__{sasha}
<D>__{i see no harm in it. let's get her to bed.}
<A>__{valentin nods. ivan appears beside him.}
<C>__{ivan}
<D>__{life returns to torture her for awhile.}
