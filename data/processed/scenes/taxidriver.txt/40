<L>__{interior firing range}
<A>__{the cracking sound of rapid fire pistol shots fills the musty air of the firing range. the walls are heavily soundproofed, and sawdust is spread over the floor. travis stands rock solid, firing the .44 magnum at an arm's length. with each blasting discharge from the magnum, travis' body shudders and shakes, his arm as if each recoil from the giant gun was a direct attack on his masculinity. travis fires the magnum as quickly as he can re set, re aim and re fire. the magnum is empty, he sets it down, picks up the .38 special and begins firing as soon as he can aim. after the .38, comes the .25: it is as if he were in a contest to see how quickly he can fire the pistols. after all the guns are discharged, he begins reloading them without a moment's hesitation. downrange, the red and white targets have the black outline of a human figure drawn over them. the contour man convulses under the steady barrage of travis' rapid fire shots.}
