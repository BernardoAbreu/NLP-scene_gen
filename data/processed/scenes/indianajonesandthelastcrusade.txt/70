<L>__{interior castle room day}
<A>__{the room is dark. ancient, floor length drapes cover the windows. a huge fireplace that's nearly large enough for a man to stand upright in dominates one wall. the nazi guards have tied indy and henry back to back in a pair of chairs. elsa and donovan stand over them. vogel enters.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{intolerable.}
<C>__{vogel}
<D>__{doctor schneider. message from berlin. you must return immediately: a rally at the institute of aryan culture.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{vogel}
<D>__{your presence on the platform is requested... at the highest level.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{thank you, herr oberst.}
<P>__{(to donovan)}
<D>__{i will meet you at iskenderun.}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{take this diary to the reich museum in berlin. it will show them our progress, ahead of schedule. without a map, i'm afraid it's no better than a souvenir.}
<A>__{he hands her the grail diary.}
<C>__{vogel}
<P>__{(to donovan, meaning indy and henry)}
<D>__{let me kill them now.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{no. if we fail to recover the pages from brody, we'll need them alive.}
<C>__{donovan}
<P>__{(to vogel, with a helpless shrug)}
<D>__{always do what the doctor orders.}
<A>__{donovan leads vogel out. the nazi guards follow. once they are gone, elsa turns to indy.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{don't look at me like thatwe both wanted the grail, i would have done anything to get it. you would have done the same.}
<A>__{indy shakes his head "no."}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{i'm sorry you think so.}
<A>__{she runs her hand down the side of his face. indy pulls away. indy and henry are still tied back to back of course. elsa bends to speak quietly into indy's ear... which is near enough to henry's ear.}
<C>__{elsa}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{i can't forget... how wonderful it was.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{thank you. it was rather wonderful.}
<A>__{she smiles and kisses indy passionately. henry glances back and looks rather disappointed. vogel appears to remind elsa of her appointment.}
<C>__{vogel}
<D>__{doctor schneider! your car is waiting.}
<C>__{elsa}
<P>__{(to indy, after finishing the kiss)}
<D>__{that's how austrians say goodbye.}
<A>__{elsa exits. vogel stays behind for another moment.}
<C>__{vogel}
<D>__{and this is how we say goodbye in germany, doctor jones.}
<A>__{vogel punches indy in the jaw. a hard and vicious jab that snaps indy's head around.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{ohh. . .}
<A>__{vogel exits. indy shakes his head clear.}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{ooooh... i like the austrian way better.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{so did i.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{let's try and get these ropes loose. we've got to get to marcus before the nazis do!}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{you said he had two days' start. that he would blend in. disappear!}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{are you kidding?i made that up! you know marcushe got lost once in his own museum!}
<A>__{indy and henry are pulling at the ropes with great urgency.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{can you try and reach into my left jacket pocket?}
<A>__{henry is able to wiggle his hand towards indy's coat pocket. indy squirms his body around towards henry's hand.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{what am i looking for?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{my lucky charm.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{feels like a cigarette lighter.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{try and burn through the ropes.}
<A>__{henry's fingers open the lighter and ignite the flame.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{very good.}
<A>__{henry yelps as the cigarette lighter burns his hand. he drops the lighter to the floor. henry kicks at the lighter, trying to reach it, but cannot. the rug starts to burn. indy doesn't know it yet.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i ought to tell you something.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{don't get sentimental now dad save it 'til we get out of here.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{the floor's on fire! see?!}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(turns and sees)}
<D>__{what???}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{and the chair.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{all right, movel move! rock your chair. do what i do.}
<A>__{they begin to rock their chair legs, inching their way off the burning carpet.}
