<L>__{134 ali's room. inside. night.}
<A>__{in the room, there is petit omar who is cutting out some pictures from a comic book. as soon as he sees ali at the door, he stops, closes his book, puts the scissors in his pocket. he seems to be embarrassed at being caught in his childish game. in the center of the room, there is a dividing curtain, pulled halfway to the side. on the other side, hassiba is typing. behind hassiba, next to the bed, the hiding place is open. ali enters. he seems tired, sweating. he removes his cloak, tosses it on the chair, and puts his machine gun on the table.}

<P>__{(turning to petit omar)}
<D>__{c'mon, hurry. go to sleep. tomorrow we four have a lot of work to do: mahmoud, hassiba, you and i.}
<A>__{mahmoud has remained motionless at the door. hassiba has stopped typing and approaches them. omar says nothing, but there is a satisfied look in his eyes. he can't help stretching out his hand to touch the machine gun. ali sits down, at the table, moves the machine gun away from omar, and continues to speak, still talking to omar.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{because we can't find anyone else, sadek will bring us there in the truck. you get out first and plant the bomb where i tell you ... then return here quickly. but be careful that no one is following you. then hassiba will get out, and after her, mahmoud. then i will plant the ones that are left. they'll know that we're still strong ... you can be sure of that.}
