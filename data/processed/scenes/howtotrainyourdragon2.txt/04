<A>__{(scene 0325 awol part two) astrid rising into view, astride stormfly. stormfly grabs talon fulls of rock to slow her landing.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{`afternoon m'lady. where have you been?}
<A>__{astrid dismounts and throws back her fur hood as toothless rushes up to greet them.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{winning races. what else? the real question is... where have you been?}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{avoiding my dad.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{oh, no. what happened now?}
<A>__{astrid sits beside hiccup, inspecting his latest addition to the map. behind them, toothless greets stormfly, inciting a play fight.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{oh, you're gonna love this. i wake up. the sun's shining. terrible terrors are singing on the rooftop. i saunter down to breakfast, thinking all is right with the world, and i get...}
<A>__{he gets to his feet and puffs out his chest.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<P>__{(aping stoick)}
<D>__{... son, we need to talk.}
<A>__{astrid smiles and adopts hiccup's sloppy slouch.}
<C>__{astrid}
<P>__{(aping hiccup)}
<D>__{not now, dad. i've got a whole day of goofing off to get started.}
<A>__{hiccup breaks character, grimacing at her impression of him.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{okay, first of all, i don't sound like that. what is this character? and second... what is that thing you're doing with my shoulders?}
<A>__{astrid laughs, jostling her shoulders in an awkward way.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{a truly flattering impersonation. anyway, he goes...}
<P>__{(resuming stoick's brogue)}
<D>__{you're the pride of berk, son, and i couldn't be prouder...}
<C>__{astrid}
<P>__{(continuing her impression of hiccup)}
<D>__{aw, thanks, dad. i'm pretty impressed with myself, too.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{when have i ever done that with my hands?}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{you just did.}
<A>__{she laughs, playfully.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{okay... just...}
<P>__{(holding her arms, mock stern)}
<D>__{hold still. it's very serious.}
<A>__{she giggles, trying to hold a straight face.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<P>__{(resuming stoick's brogue)}
<D>__{you're all grown up, and since no chief could ask for a better successor, i've decided }
<A>__{astrid straightens, her face brightening.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{ to make you chief! oh, my gods!}
<A>__{she jumps to her feet, beaming...}
<C>__{astrid }
<D>__{hiccup, that's amazing!}
<A>__{and socks hiccup in congratulations, deliberately hitting the dorsal fin release button and triggering it to pop up. she laughs as hiccup reels it back in, self consciously.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{you're gonna wear out the spring coil. the calibration is very sensitive!}
<A>__{they're suddenly bowled over by toothless and stormfly.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{yeah, so... this is what i'm dealing with.}
<A>__{astrid helps him up and dusts him off.}
<C>__{astrid}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{what did you tell him?}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{i didn't. by the time he turned around, i was gone.}
<A>__{astrid picks up the map, folding it as she paces around him, processing it all.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{well, it's a lot of responsibility. the map will have to wait for sure, and i will need to fly toothless, since you'll be too busy...}
<A>__{she pauses, wincing in sympathy. she turns to hiccup. he nods knowingly, taking the map from her.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{it's not me, astrid. all those speeches, and planning, and running the village... that's his thing.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{i think you're missing the pointerior i mean, chief. what an honor. i'd be pretty excited.}
<A>__{hiccup shakes his head.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{i'm not like you. you know exactly who you are. you always have. but...}
<A>__{he shuffles to the cliff's edge, gazing out at the new land.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{i'm still looking. i know that i'm not my father... and i never met my mother... so, what does that make me?}
<A>__{he sits at the edge, looking burdened, restless. astrid approaches and settles beside him, joining him in looking out at the distant horizon. she weaves another braid into his hair as she speaks.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{what you're searching for... isn't out there, hiccup.}
<A>__{she places a hand on his chest.}
<C>__{astrid }
<D>__{it's in here.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{maybe you just don't see it yet.}
<A>__{she kisses his cheek, but gets a mouthful of toothless' slobber. she grimaces, wiping it off. distracted, hiccup eyes the horizon keenly.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{maybe. but, y'know... there is something out there.}
<C>__{astrid}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{hiccup...}
<A>__{he turns her face to the horizon. a distant smoke plume rises from a misty valley.}
