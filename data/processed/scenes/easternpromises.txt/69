<L>__{interior trans siberian restaurant. cellar night}
<D>__{the cellar is half lit, the arched walls lined with crates of wine. flour, grease and potatoes are stored here. as nikolai walks down the steps into the gloom, he hears kirill singing a russian folk song to himself as he drags a case of brandy across the cellar floor. kirill has already opened a bottle of brandy and takes a long swig as nikolai joins him. he grins as he gestures at the brandy...}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{my dad swapped a little georgian girl for this stuff. nikolai sits down on a crate, rests his head against the wall. kirill joins him and swigs some more.}
<C>__{kirill }
<D>__{hey, don't feel bad. what happened up there is just how he is. he plays people against each other. that's all. i realize more and more what he's like. here, drink to the georgian girl... kirill offers the bottle to nikolai but he refuses.}
<C>__{kirill }
<D>__{what? i drink alone now. nikolai decides to bite the bullet, get this news over with.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{he offered me stars. i accepted them. a long pause. this is what kirill wanted, but now it feels like a stab in the back. finally kirill swallows a huge swig of brandy then turns awkwardly to hug nikolai. he squeezes him hard for a long time then shoves him away.}
<C>__{kirill}
<P>__{(lying))}
<D>__{you think i didn't know already? he told me before. it was my fucking idea. he said there are a lot of things i have to teach you. nikolai nods. kirill gets to his feet....}
<C>__{kirill }
<D>__{some stuff will take a long time. i've been protecting you until now.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{what? a pause.}
<C>__{kirill }
<D>__{you think i don't know stuff you don't know? i am vor by birth. the stars are a birthmark for me...}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{i know, kirill. kirill is about to fly into a rage but nikolai gets to his feet.}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{where the fuck are you going? we've got to celebrate. help me with these bottles. nikolai heads for the steps.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{your dad don't need the bottles any more. as nikolai departs kirill calls after him.}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{hey! we're still partners, right? thunder and lightning! nikolai climbs the steps. kirill is left to swig his brandy and stare into the darkness. he wipes his eyes angrily with his sleeve.}
