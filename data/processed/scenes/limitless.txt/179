<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{and so... here i am.}
<A>__{and now we pick up eddie where we left him, standing on the ledge.}
<D>__{eddie (v.0.) (cont'd) i knew they would kill me, slowly and horribly. but this choice would at least be mine.}
<A>__{we now hear the zzzzzzzz! of some major power tool drilling at the door, punctuated by more bams! one way or another they're going to get in. eddie takes a breath, tries to jump. he can't.}
<D>__{eddie (v.0.) (cont'd) but we're instinctive creatures. we want to live. eddie (v.0.) (cont'd) so, my foggy brain tried to remember... where one tablet of mdt... might be.}
<A>__{we push in on eddie's eyes... we are still rewinding in eddie's mind... images of where we've seen him keep mdt... nothing... nothing... nothing... we stop at the sugarbowl on eddie's dining table. then go forward no, wait! rewinding, stopping again on the sugar bowl. pushing in on the sugar bowl. eddie spins around, looks back into his apartment, eyes intense.}
<D>__{eddie (v.o.) (cont'd) it was possible. and possible was enough.}
