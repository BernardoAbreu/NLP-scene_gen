<L>__{interior the basement oven room day}
<A>__{there are two coal fired ovens, one at either end of the room. there is a large wooden table roughly center. and various pieces of baking equipment, dough mixers, etc., scattered willy nilly. and everywhere there is bread. pietro, a baker, is working at one of the ovens with a long wooden spatula. ronny is working at the other oven. actually, he is just staring in the open door at the baking bread and burning coals. he's dressed in black jeans streaked with flour, a white restaurant shirt, white cotton gloves, and around his neck, a red handkerchief. he is black haired, handsome and intense.}

<C>__{ronny}
<D>__{i have no life. my brother johnny took my life from me.}
<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<A>__{everything in the oven room has stopped and everyone is watching.}
<C>__{ronny}
<D>__{and now he's getting married. he has his, he's getting his. and he wants me to come? what is life?}
<A>__{he picks up the wooden spatula and slides it into the oven.}
<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{i didn't come here to upset you.}
<A>__{ronny slides a bunch of loaves out of the oven on the spatula, turns them around, and slides them back in.}
<C>__{ronny}
<D>__{they say bread is life. so i bake bread, bread, bread.}
<P>__{(he's picking up loaves}
<D>__{of bread from one of the boxes on the floor, and casually tossing them across}
<P>__{the room.)}
<D>__{and the years go by! by! by! and i sweat and shovel this stinking dough in and outta this hot hole in the wall and i should be so happy, huh, sweetheart? you want me to come to the wedding of my brother johnny?!! where is my wedding? chrissy! over by the wall! gimme the big knife!}
<C>__{chrissy}
<D>__{no, ronny!}
<A>__{barbara appears in the doorway and comes down the stairs into the room.}
<C>__{ronny}
<D>__{gimme the big knife! i'm gonna cut my throat!}
<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{maybe i should come back another time.}
<C>__{ronny}

<C>__{chrissy}
<D>__{i tell you i won't do it!}
<C>__{ronny}
<P>__{(to loretta)}
<D>__{do you know about me?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{oh, mr. cammareri!}
<C>__{ronny}
<D>__{nothing is anybody's fault, but things happen.}
<P>__{(holds up his left hand to loretta)}
<D>__{look.}
<A>__{he pulls off the glove. the hand is made of wood.}
<C>__{ronny}
<D>__{it's wood. it's fake. five years ago i was engaged to be married. johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. i put it in the slicer and i talked with him and my hand got caught cause i wasn't paying attention. the slicer chewed off my hand. it's funny 'cause when my fiance saw that i was maimed, she left me for another man.}
<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{that's the bad blood between you and johnny?}
<C>__{ronny}
<D>__{that's it.}
<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{but that wasn't johnny's fault.}
<C>__{ronny}
<D>__{i don't care! i ain't no freakin monument to justice! i lost my hand, i lost my bride! johnny has his hand, johnny has his bride! you come in here and you want me to put away my heartbreak and forget?}
<A>__{he goes to the big table, which is floured and covered with bread. he sweeps everything off the tabletop during the nexterior}
<C>__{ronny}
<D>__{is it just a matter of time till a man opens his eyes and gives up his one dream of happiness? maybe. maybe. all i have... have you come here, stranger, bride of my brother, to take these last few loaves from my table? alright. alright.}
<A>__{the table is bare. he stares at it blankly. he wanders away, to the back room where the flour sacks are kept. we hear a single sob escape him from that room, and then silence. everyone in the oven room looks after him. then chrissy approaches loretta. she holds the big knife at her side.}
<C>__{chrissy}
<D>__{this is the most tormented man i have ever known. i am in love with this man. he doesn't know that. i never told him cause he can never love anybody since he lost his hand and his girl.}
<A>__{she holds out the knife.}
<C>__{chrissy}
<D>__{here. why don't you just kill him? it would be so much more kind than coming here and inviting him to a wedding like he'll never have.}
<A>__{loretta considers chrissy, decides what she's going to do, and goes to the flour room.}
