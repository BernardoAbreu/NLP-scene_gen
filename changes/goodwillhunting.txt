You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help.

That God had put an angel on Earth just for you.  And you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel. To have the love be there for her forever. Through anything, through cancer.

A cute, little ancillary benefit for them but it ain't helping my buddy at two-fifty a gallon.

So my buddy's out of work and he can't afford to drive so he's got to walk to the job interviews which sucks 'cause the shrapnel in his ass is givin' him chronic hemorrhoids.
