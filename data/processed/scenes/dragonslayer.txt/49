<T>__{dissolve:}
<A>__{on the road day the trail leads through copses and open meadows. side by side, galen and valerian march up a long slope under a hot sun. he limps a bit; she finds a staff and hands it to him.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{you want to rest?}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{no. i'm fine.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{you miss ulricn.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{and the amulet.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{that too.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{not me. i'm glad it's gone. i'm glad you did what you did.}
<P>__{(he doesn't reply)}
<D>__{you may not be a sorcerer, galen, but i love you anyway. i don't regret anything that happened. i just wish }
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{valerian}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{ that we had a horse.}
<A>__{galen falls a step behind. he briefly closes his eyes and mutters something. they walk on a few paces. then there is a whinny from the nearby woods and a white stallion canters forth. it crosses a meadow, comes right up to valerian and nuzzles her.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{a horse.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{did you...!?}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{no. it must have been wandering loose. or wild.}
<A>__{galen climbs aboard. he reaches out to help her up.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{wait a minute. i just wished for a horse and here it is.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{you don't want to wish it gone, do you?}
<A>__{she thinks for a moment, then lets him help her up. galen touches the horse's flanks with his heels and they ride off.}
