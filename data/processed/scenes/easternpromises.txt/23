<L>__{interior helen's house. dining room night}
<D>__{sudden silence... perhaps the ticking of a clock. this is anna's christmas dinner, a total contrast to the chaos of the restaurant. stepan is attempting to carve the chicken.}
<C>__{stepan}
<D>__{anna, how come is it that your boyfriend isn't here to carve? stepan takes a large sip of vodka.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i don't live with oliver any more, uncle stepan. i'm living back here for a bit.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{for as long as you want.}
<C>__{stepan}
<D>__{i knew he would run away from you.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{he didn't run away. you make me sound like a burning building.}
<C>__{stepan}
<D>__{black men always run away.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{oh stepan!}
<C>__{stepan}
<D>__{what? i am allowed to be honest?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{he was a doctor, stepan.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what the hell has that got to do with it? a pause. stepan sips his vodka.}
<C>__{stepan}
<D>__{it is not natural to mix race and race. that is why your baby died inside you. anna slams her napkin onto the table.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{stepan, shut up!}
<P>__{(anna gets to her feet)}
<D>__{please anna. helen takes anna's hand but she turns and leaves. helen stands to follow her, but first she whips stepan's vodka away from him.}
<C>__{helen }
<D>__{you're just how he was. stupid bloody drunken russians.}
