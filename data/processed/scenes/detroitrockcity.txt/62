<L>__{exterior freeway day}
<A>__{the trans am muscles the volvo into the breakdown lane. parking the ass end of the pontiac out a bit, kenny blocks the volvo in. kenny and bobby climb from their car and storm over to the boys. hawk opens his door just as kenny's hairy knuckled hands pull him out through the window. he grabs trip, yanking him out too. bobby opens the back door and does the same with lex and jam. with a kid in each hand now, kenny and bobby slam the four boys against the volvo in a line. the size difference between the burnouts and the guidos is painfully obvious now. kenny and bobby are neanderthals.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as ivory snow, absolutely friggin' stupidity of what you just did?}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{hey, disco dude, it's cool...}
<A>__{kenny hauls back and slaps the row of boys in the faces three stooges style... whackwhackwhackwhack!}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{do you?!}
<A>__{trip, lex, and jam clutch their faces in pain. hawk looks merely disenchanted as kenny pokes a muscle bound finger at his chest. getting in hawk's face, kenny yammers loud and fast.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{lemme paint you a friggin' picture ahright? imagine if you will a 1978 pontiac trans american in pristine condition.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{an appealing portrait, nesspah?}
<A>__{hawk starts to say "yes."}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{but wait! what's that spec on the windshield? could it be a wad of melted mozzarella, tangy tomato sauce, and various friggin' meat products?}
<A>__{hawk is unimpressed.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{could be.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{and if it ain't cleaned off?}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{kenny, come on with the macho crap already. like this kid could take you in a fight anyway.}
<C>__{kenny}
<P>__{(ignoring christine)}
<D>__{answer me, hippie girl. and if the mess ain't cleaned off my car?}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{it could... bake on?}
<A>__{kenny looks at bobby and they exchange moronic grins.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{you're a smart little homo, aren't you, hippie girl? but, while astounded at your nimble, friggin' insight, i still detect an issue hanging fire, namely: where does a sharp witted faggot like yourself get off doing such a dopey thing like that there?}
<A>__{hawk figured out that any answer he gives will be incorrect and has decided to wait till kenny's done.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{no really, i'm perplexed. i mean, could you have done stupider if you were born without a fuckin' head?!}
<C>__{christine}
<P>__{(using "oh" to mean "enough")}
<D>__{oh! with the language!}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{shut up, christine!}
<A>__{christine snarls at kenny.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{okay, kenny? i don't mean to drain your keg or anything, but could you speed up this process?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{don't get me wrong, we'd love to stand here and get shit on by the cast of saturday night fever, but we're also on a schedule. so step on it.}
<A>__{cold silence as kenny replays hawk's insult over in his head.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{are you gettin' wise with me?}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{no, i'm dumber than a goddamn slug. now can i please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{break his fawkin' legs, kenny!}
<A>__{kenny's temper's rising faster than the price of gasoline. hawk on the other hand is cooler than an otter pop.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{oh, you're dumb all right, you hairy ass punk. but please, allow me to clean the friggin' windshield. i insist.}
<A>__{and with that, kenny grabs himself a fistful of hawk's long hair and pulls him over to the trans am. he wipes the pizza off with hawk's hair, tugging hawk's head up and down, back and forth. hawk grunts with each wipe, but doesn't give kenny the satisfaction of hearing him scream. trip, lex, and jam watch helplessly, trapped under bobby's dull witted, but equally threatening gaze. kenny gets the last of the big chunks off his windshield and looks at his handiwork.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{there. nice and clean.}
<A>__{he throws hawk to the ground and smiles at bobby. then, he suddenly hears the kiss tune coming from the volvo. uh oh!}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{oh, no, no, no! it's the fag band!}
<A>__{kenny clenches his jaws and walks up to the volvo, reaching in the driver's door. suddenly jam grabs his wrist.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{whoa! this is about pizza! let's leave kiss out of it. please.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{a bunch of guys who make bad music, dress like freaks, and wear more make up than all my sisters combined? these assholes must be stopped!}
<A>__{kenny pushes jam away.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{that's it, kenny! i'm leaving!}
<A>__{christine gets out of the car and starts walking down the highway, exiting the scene.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{oh, christine! you googatz in the head or something? we're on the side of the freakin' highway!}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{let her go, barbara, she'll come back to kenny. she always does...}
<P>__{(to kenny)}
<D>__{right, kenny?}
<A>__{kenny meanwhile has his arm in the volvo.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{kool and the gang, now there's real music.}
<A>__{kenny takes the 8 track from the car...}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{but this... is crap!}
<A>__{he flings it into the highway, where it is summarily smashed to bits under the wheels of a passing semi. follow a chunk of cartridge and a strand of mangled tape streaming from it as it sails back toward the side of the road, landing at jam's feet. tilt up to jam's face. he raises his eyes and turns to the camera, a single tear rolling down his cheek, just like the indian in that "keep america beautiful" litter ad. hawk rises and kenny comes face to face with him.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{so. all that having been said and done, i believe we are ready for the final topic of discussion. namely: have you learned your lesson yet, puke?}
<A>__{hawk pulls a cigarette from his pocket and lights it. he blows some smoke in kenny's face.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{well, let's recap, shall we? you slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our love gun 8 track under the wheels of a passing semi.}
<P>__{(puffing on cig)}
<D>__{so, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... i'd say we learned it.}
<C>__{kenny}
<P>__{(beat, in disbelief)}
<D>__{excuse me, i'm a little deef a hearin'. can you repeat yourself?}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{okay. ahem! you. are. a. dick. with. ears. and. a. really. bad. haircut.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{oh, yeah...?}
<A>__{out of original material, kenny goes for an old stand by.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{that's not what your mother said last night.}
<A>__{trip, lex, and jam exchange "uh oh" glances. meanwhile, hawk's eyes glaze over.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{it's not, huh? well, then, tell me...}
<A>__{hawk reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out his mostly empty can of hawaiian punch, holding it discreetly at his side.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{...what exactly did my mother say last night?}
<A>__{kenny draws a blank, not being prepared for this one.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{you heard me, prick. what did my mother say last night?}
<A>__{kenny chuckles and looks at bobby. they have a good little laugh... the homo's got balls! then kenny turns back to hawk.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{okay, fagmo... i will tell you what your mother said last night.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{she said that i was the fuck of her life.}
<A>__{hawk is a little mad now. he tosses his cigarette to the ground and squashes it like a bug under his sneaker.}
<C>__{hawk}
<P>__{(very clint eastwood)}
<D>__{how would you like a nice hawaiian punch?}
<C>__{kenny}
<P>__{(smirking)}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{quick as a shot, hawk slams the bottom of the can into kenny's nose, crushing it flat against his face. hawaiian backwash spews from its tab hole like blood as kenny falls backwards from the impact. he hits his head on the ground. taking this as a cue... trip whips out his wallet on a chain... lex rips off his kiss belt... and jam yanks out his drumsticks. as if choreographed, trip swoops the wallet at bobby's feet, snagging him around the ankles tightly with the chain. lex thwams bobby in the face with his big kiss belt buckle leaving a reversed, red, kiss logo branded in his forehead. trip yanks the chain pulling bobby off his feet. when he hits the ground, jam's right there drumming his balls. bobby shrieks. meanwhile, hawk advances on kenny who tries to get the can off his face, but it's stuck on looking like a pig's nose with fruit punch for snot. hawk raises both his hands in kenny's face, then executes the final insult... hawk messes kenny's hair. kenny lets out a scream that comes from the bottom of his vanity. hawk grabs kenny by the ears and brings the guido's head swiftly against his kneecap. kenny falls to the ground, unconscious on top of bobby. their heads collide knocking bobby out cold. terrified, barbara leaps from the trans am and is cornered.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{not so fast, stella.}
