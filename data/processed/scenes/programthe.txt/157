<L>__{interior coach winter's office afternoon}
<A>__{the coach is facing ray and darnell across his desk.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{i wanta do something different for this game. try to maximize our speed, but keep you both in the lineup at the same time. ray, i'm moving you to fullback. darnell, you're startin' at tail.}
<A>__{ray is stunned, darnell elated, but neither says a word.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{ray, you'll be carrying the ball less and blocking more, but they'll still have to respect your running and pass catching ability. not everybody can make a transition like this. you think you can handle it?}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(tight lipped)}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{good. we can't afford any hang dogs.}
