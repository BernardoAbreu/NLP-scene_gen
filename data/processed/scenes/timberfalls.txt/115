<A>__{deacon tears open sheryl's blouse, exposing her bra and more cleavage. he slides his hands over her breasts... he's in heaven. sheryl doesn't resist because... close on the knot's undone. her hands are free. deacon looks into sheryl's eyes. he senses something different. does he know? deacon pulls himself closer to sheryl. their faces only inches apart. he pulls her gag out of her mouth, lets it dangle around her neck. sheryl swallows nervously. resists the urge to scream. she's frozen. then... deacon leans in... kisses sheryl. knowing it's now or never, sheryl knees deacon in the balls. he falls over in agony. deacon looks up at her, when... smack! she kicks him right in the face. sheryl springs from the chair, grabs the sickle, turns and... crack! deacon, already back on his feet, punches sheryl hard across the jaw. she hits the wall, then falls to the floor, drops the sickle. angle on a small pocket knife falls off a shelf in the room onto the floor. deacon grabs the sickle, then lifts her up by her hair and drags her across the room. he throws her face stomach down on the table top, flips her dress up onto her back. he slides the sickle between her ass and underwear and... cuts her panties off in one quick motion, spreads her legs apart. sheryl, still stunned from the punch, only now starts to realize what is happening to her.}
