<A>__{lying on an operating table in a large army field tent in viet nam. the doctor steps away. a nurse rudely pulls a green sheet up over his head. the doctor turns to one of the aides and throws up his hands in defeat. two orderlies wheel jacob's body past rows of other doctors and nurses fighting to save lives. a young vietnamese boy pulls back a screen door to let them out of the tent. it is a bright, fresh morning. the sun is rising.}
