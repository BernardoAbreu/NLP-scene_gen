<D>__{there!}

<D>__{get the goddam door!}
<A>__{leonard and peter both grab its handle, slide it shut... splack! the mimic crashes into it! klanggg! the door bulges out from the impact, almost tearing itself off the hinges. susan jumps back. manny runs to cover her. the creature is caught, half in, half out, antennae and forelegs waving wildly! the abdomen crashes through a pane of glass.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{push it! push it! don't let up!}
<A>__{leonard and peter push harder, barely keeping it pinned.}
<B>__{the upper half of the mimic tears itself loose.}
<A>__{white blood spatters everywhere. the mimic is now cut in: half! the wings flap wildly, the abdomen shatters the safety window's outer panels. but the front section is still alive. it scrabbles in, spraying white blood... ...drags itself up on the ceiling, then down onto the floor and under a row of shelves in a half circle around the car till it finally comes to a halt. silence. the only sound is a skittering outside. susan looks outside the window. the mimic's rear half is still trying to push through the door, its feet blindly dragging along.}

<D>__{get it! get it off me!}
<A>__{peter and manny try to pull the thing off as leonard falls and writhes on the floor. bam! bam! bam! the men flinch away as leonard empties his guns on it, until the thing's shell finally cracks! but the thing is still locked onto leonard's leg. peter tries to work it free from the creature's jaws. no good.}
