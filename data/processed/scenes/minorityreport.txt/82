<L>__{exterior the sprawl day}
<A>__{the suspension bridge where we saw anderson vaporize the python transport. witwer stands watching as a precrime techno unit sifts through the white ashes. witwer lifts his face to the acrid breeze coursing off the potomac. it's a pose a track dog might hold, nose up, testing the air for a scent.}
<L>__{interior boarding house room the sprawl day}
<A>__{we can't see anything at first, because anderson can't see anything either. he's in a deep post surgical haze. doc's voice comes to him. it's warped and ugly.}
<C>__{doc's voice}
<D>__{don't take the bandages off for twenty four hours. you'll go blind if you do.}
<A>__{anderson makes an affirmative grunt. now we see his surroundings, even though anderson still can't. he lies in a grungy bed, his head and eyes swathed in white dressings. doc stands over him.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{you're in a room. i had you moved here, a couple miles from my place. if they find you, they don't find me.}
<A>__{anderson grunts weakly.}
<C>__{doc }
<D>__{a guy will come in, feed you once.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i juiced up the nano reconstruction around your new eyes, 'cause i know you're in a hurry.}
<C>__{anderson}
<P>__{(fuzzily))}
<D>__{nano re ...construction.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{organic microrobots that reconstruct nerves and blood vessels. it'll feel like fleas chewing on your eyeballs. don't scratch.}
<A>__{anderson is already reaching his hands for his bandages. doc forces them away.}
<C>__{doc }
<D>__{i'm giving you a bonus, might come in handy. feel this.}
<A>__{doc takes an air syringe out of his pocket and touches it to anderson's hand.}
<C>__{doc }
<D>__{it's a temporary paralytic enzyme. someone spots you, you duck into an alley, shoot this under your chin.}
<A>__{doc presses the tip into the soft underpart of anderson's chin. anderson jumps.}
<C>__{doc }
<D>__{the enzyme turns your facial muscles to mush. you won't look like the same man.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{jesus.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{you tighten up again in about thirty minutes. hurts like nothing you ever felt. it's vicious, but effective. i will put it in your bag.}
<A>__{finally, doc takes a small clock out of his pocket and places it on a dresser beside anderson's bed.}
<C>__{doc }
<D>__{i'm setting up a timer. when it buzzes tomorrow, take off your bandages, and get the hell out of here.}
<A>__{anderson, groggy, starts to say something else, but then he hears a door open and close, and doc is gone.}
