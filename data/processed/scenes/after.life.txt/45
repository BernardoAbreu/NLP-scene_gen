<A>__{paul wakes up. badly hung over. still in his clothes. sunlight streams into the room. blinding him. he reaches across. the bed's empty. he's surprised for a moment then remembers the argument the night before. he gets up. sits on the edge of the bed. lights a cigarette. he notices his jacket on the floor. leans down. as he pulls out the blackberry from his jacket, the ring box falls onto the floor. paul doesn't notice.}
