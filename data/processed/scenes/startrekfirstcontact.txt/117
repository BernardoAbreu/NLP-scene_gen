<A>__{ruby is turning off the spigot on the filter pump. the plastic jug is now filled with the clear fluid silver halide. she caps the jug, picks it up, begins walking up on the porch...then hesitates for a moment... looks out over the horizon. she hesitates... then frowns and goes inside... ruby comes inside, sets down the jug... begins to pick up some more glass plates... stops... thinks... looks up. only a few feet away is the large picture of picard. she doesn't want to look at him, doesn't want to think about him... but there he is. she glances back at the open door... struggles for a moment... then makes a decision. despite herself, she can't get picard out of her head. with a little frustration, she grabs her camera bag and heads for the door...}
