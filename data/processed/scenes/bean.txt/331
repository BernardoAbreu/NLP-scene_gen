<A>__{jennifer is still asleep. bean is sitting on the end of her bed. he looks at the super nintendo console thinking, "how can i get this working again? how can i help?" the only sound in the room is the beeping from the e.c.g. machine, monitoring jennifer's heart. bean has an idea. he yanks off the jack plug at the end of the super nintendo lead. producing his small screwdriver, he starts to unscrew the console casing.}
