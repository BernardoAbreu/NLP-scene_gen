<A>__{the house is empty as before. now it is silent, the late afternoon light coming from outside. reggie stands by a window. a canvas airline bag rests on the floor nearby. suddenly there is the noise of a door opening. closer shot reggie as her head turns, in alarm, toward the noise. there is a moment of silence, then footsteps are heard, coming closer.}
