<D>__{well it's just one of those things. you know... purely an accident, um. my husband had oh... been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night. and well danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room... and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them. it's...it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child you know, in a park or on the streets but on this particular occasion my husband just... used too much strength and he injured danny's arm.}
