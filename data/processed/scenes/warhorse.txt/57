<L>__{interior exterior farmhouse farm. day.}
<A>__{a small humble farmhouse and round it, small fields, planted with different fruit crops. we see an old man (grandfather), burdened with a basket of berries heading back towards the farmhouse. a sound causes him to look out across the farm far in the distance the storm of war is in the sky. he enters the kitchen which is rough, but full of the paraphernalia of jam making jars, sieves, pectin, sugar. emilie is at the sink, washing berries.}
