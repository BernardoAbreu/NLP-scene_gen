<A>__{rebecca presses against him, raising her knee gently into his groin as she kisses him passionately. dulaney is lost in her kiss for a moment, then breaks it off and looks around. rebecca smiles takes off her shoes and stands on the hood of her car. she takes one of the shoes and hits the parking lot overhead light fixture. the bulb breaks sending the area in darkness.}
