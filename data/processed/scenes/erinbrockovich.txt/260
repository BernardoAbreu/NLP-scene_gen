<A>__{erin and embry are the only patrons. erin's eating a burger. embry has a beer. he's talking quietly, not looking at her.}
<C>__{embry}
<D>__{i was working in the compressor, and out of nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the office and says, we're gonna give you a shredder machine, and send you on down to the warehouse. we want you to get rid of all the documents stored out there.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{did he say why?}
<C>__{embry}
<D>__{nope. and i didn't ask.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?}
<C>__{embry}
<D>__{well, it's pretty boring work, shredding you gotta find some way to entertain your mind. so yeah, i took a look.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{and ...?}
<C>__{embry}
<D>__{there was a lot of dull stuff vacation schedules, the like.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but then there were a few memos about the holding ponds. the water in them. they had readings from test wells, stuff like that.}
<A>__{erin tries to hide her excitement at this information.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{and you were told to destroy those?}
<C>__{embry}
<D>__{that's right.}
<A>__{destruction of evidence. pretty big deal. erin plays it down. wipes her mouth with her napkin, takes a sip of beer.}
<C>__{embry}
<D>__{course as it turns out, i'm not a very good employee.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{embry}
<D>__{well. there were a few documents that i somehow didn't get around to shredding.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that i kept instead.}
<A>__{erin stops, mid bite.}
