<L>__{int exterior robard's club}
<A>__{sidney lingers near the doorway of the club. he is looking across the square towards the car which can be seen in b.g. now he turns and walks towards the coat rack, camera tracking with him. he takes his own coat and, as he thrusts his arm into the sleeve, contrives neatly to slip some unseen object into the pocket of steve's overcoat; camera notes the gesture, but only very briefly. overscene a voice addresses sidney:}
<C>__{d'angelo }
<D>__{hey!..........}
<B>__{sidney}
<A>__{a close up. as he turns in swift apprehension, we note the moment of panic in his face.}
<B>__{reverse angle}
<A>__{camera shoots past sidney in foreground towards d'angelo who advances on sidney. d'angelo's manner is unfriendly; for an instant we feel, like sidney, that d'angelo may have seen sidney tampering with steve's coat, but then we are reassured as d'angelo, deliberately using sidney's surname, says:}
<C>__{d'angelo}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{mr. falco...i hate to give you this satisfaction they broke it off tonight for good.}
<B>__{reverse angle}
<A>__{shooting across d'angelo onto sidney, who now relaxes, his fears ungrounded.}
<C>__{d'angelo}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{tell that to hunsecker tell him we agree he's a big man he wins all the marbles!}
<B>__{sidney}
<A>__{as d'angelo moves away again sidney looks after him. once more his face goes tense. (he asks himself, does this development which he himself anticipated change the situation?) he turns away, moving out of shot.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{camera moves with sidney as he walks towards the doorway. there he hesitates again; he looks back into the club.}
<B>__{dallas}
<A>__{from sidney's viewpointerior a long shot of steve on the bandstand. camera pans deliberately towards the coatrack in f.g. a group of newly arrived musicians walk into the shot, setting down their instrument cases and starting to hang up their coats. (clearly, sidney could not now return to the coat rack even if he decided that he did want to undo his handiwork.)}
<B>__{resume sidney}
<A>__{camera, shooting out across the square, frames sidney in f.g. facing the inevitable, sidney turns away, walks across the sidewalk. on the other side of the square the headlamps of the car blink twice. sidney walks towards it.}
<B>__{police car}
<A>__{a big man gets out of the seat next to the driver. as he comes round the hood of the car, the headlamps of a passing truck illuminate him, identifying harry kello. camera pans as he walks to meet sidney.}
<B>__{closer angle}
<A>__{kello pauses as sidney comes up to him, asks affably:}
<C>__{kello}
<D>__{what's all the rush? you said three o'clock.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(glancing back towards club)}
<D>__{he's leaving early. after this "set". he'll be out in a couple of minutes...}
<A>__{they wait for a moment, listening to the sound of the music in the distance. it is a blues number (goodbye baby) kello hums nonchalantly; sidney glances at him with irritation, finding something gruesome in his relaxed manner.}
