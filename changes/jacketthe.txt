<DIAL>__{Written by Massy Tadjedin Based on a screenplay by Marc Rocco April 15, 2003}
<ACTION>__{A pure white screen. Idyllic stillness. All of it looking and feeling like the heavens are supposed to. After some seconds of calm, water seems to mist the screen and the slight shifts to the left and then the right suggest this is a man's P.O.V. Then, suddenly, the white screen is tugged and we see it was a sheet covering a presumably dead man.}

<ACTION>__{One more tug on the sheet and we see, and suddenly hear, from William Starks' P.O.V. the CHAOS of the hospital around him as DOCTORS and NURSES tend as best as they can to the injured soldiers. Our glimpse of STARKS reveals a red stretcher -- soaked in blood -- and the severe head wound where a bullet's minced his skull. Then, slowly, steadily, a heartbeat is heard over the muffled sounds of the hospital and, as his pulse quickens, so does the pace of the world around him.}

<DIAL>__{I remember there was so much white everywhere. And I felt peace...even though there was war around me. And I felt alive, even though I knew I was dead. INTERN #1 Come on, come on, let's tag these guys and get them out of here.}
<ACTION>__{An INTERN, clipboard in hand, stands above STARKS' unmoving body with another INTERN (2) beside him. INTERN 1 pulls the rest of the SHEET off of STARKS as the OTHER searches for his DOG TAGS and gently closes his EYES with her hand.}
<DIAL>__{INTERN #2 [Reading from the TAGS] Starks, William. Born December 25, INTERN #1 Wait, so how old? INTERN #2 INTERN #1 [Searching through records] Here he is. William Starks. Born in Vermont. He hasn't got a family listed. The naval hospital'll figure out what to do with him.}
<ACTION>__{As the INTERN puts the TAGS back down, she meets STARKS' wide- open EYES -- now filled with surfacing tears, sadness, and life. She stares at them curiously and, after some seconds, STARKS blinks and a TEAR runs down his cheek -- jarring her.}
<DIAL>__{INTERN #2 [Calling out] Oh my God! This soldier is ALIVE! Code blue! CODE BLUE! This man just blinked! INTERN #1 He's been tagged already. Worry about the others... [then seeing STARKS blink] Oh shit! Shit! CODE BLUE! We need a doctor! Get a doctor over here now!}

<LOC>__{EXT. AMERICAN NAVAL HOSPITAL, DAY}
<ACTION>__{STARKS convalesces in a navy hospital bed -- his head heavily BANDAGED and his arms suited with I.V.'s and dressings -- as a MAJOR, a LIEUTENANT and a DOCTOR stand above him. STARKS' face -- now cleaned of the blood that masked it before -- is alert, and striking. Even with the bandages, he remains well-built and strong, like a shot straight to the head would have been the only way for an enemy to take him down.}

<ACTION>__{There are three KEY WITNESSES called to the stand: CAPTAIN MEDLEY, Starks' commanding officer in the Persian Gulf; DR. HALE, a psychiatrist; and OFFICER NASH, the cop who first came upon the crime scene. Their three testimonies are intercut to present the case against Starks quickly and confusingly -- just like it appears to himself.}

<CHAR>__{DR. HALE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{William Starks could be blocking the incident. It would explain his well- systematized scheme about the little girl and her mother.

<DIAL>__{Sergeant Starks was awarded the Purple Heart. That award doesn't applaud violence or murder. [Beat] It applauds honor. DR. HALE [Cont'd] His subconscious is blocking it, the same way it began to in the Gulf, particularly as something similarly traumatizing happened to him then.}
<ACTION>__{The following summations are punctuated by the BLACK FADES between them and the simulated BLACK around them as they speak -- like STARKS, at the beginning of his own testimony.}
<DIAL>__{PROSECUTION [Disdainfully] It's not a question of whether or not he was sane when he did it?! He absolutely was. Three bullets in one man are three moral failings in another. CAPTAIN MEDLEY [Incensed] War isn't a CNN Special. Half the shit that went on couldn't be tidied into a top of the hour headline -- either 'cause it couldn't be said neatly or 'cause it couldn't be said at all. It was ugly. And they don't put ugly on TV. [Looking at Starks] If Starks did kill that officer ... [Beat] You can't hold a man responsible for a damaged mind.}

DAMON looks at STARKS -- his eyes inadvertently conceding that Starks is more threatening than the common senile he marshals; STARKS stares him back -- deliberately conceding that he's right.

Made of coarse, sickly- stained red ands brown canvas and velcro restraints that would first chafe, then forever burn, the skin they're wrapped around, the JACKET looks medieval. Its appearance suggests its purpose: to slowly STRANGLE THE LIFE OUT OF A MAN. STARKS has been stripped of his blue uniform and is lying nearly naked on a burial slab in the cold of the basement. Even under the tranquilizers, STARKS formidably resists them as the ORDERLIES wrestle to strap him in.

His eyes close and STARKS sees and hears a FLASH... 3) From the barrel of a GUN fired near him. BLOOD sprays STARKS' hands as he looks down at them and realizes he's in the scene and not just watching it. He looks up from his hands and sees in similar flashes... 1) The snow beneath the BLOOD changing to DIRT as STARKS stares at it. This time, the little river of RED comes from... 2) The BODIES of IRAQI villagers, all still except one... 3) That of a IRAQI WOMAN. She unflinchingly lays her hand in the entrails of a CORPSE and smears its blood on her face just before she lies back down among the dead, content to be one of them.
