<L>__{interior the titty twister night}
<A>__{if the titty twister looked like the asshole of the world from the outside, in the immortal words of al jolson, "you ain't seen nothin' yet." this is the kind of place where they sweep up the teeth and hose down the cum, the blood and the beer at closing. in the back, topless dancers do lap dances with customers, while a sleazy sexy stripper strips to raunchy music, played at ear drum bursting level. two men are in a savage bareknuckle fight, surrounded by screaming customers of bikers and truckers. one of the dancers is a man with a saddle on his back, his name is danny the wonder pony. the woman on his back, in the saddle, feet in the stirrups, hands on the reins, is athena, his rider. they dance around to the cheers of the crowd. bikers and truckers play pool in the back. fights break out here about one every ten minutes. the customers may start 'em, but the bouncer, big emilio, ends 'em. seth, richard, jacob, scott and kate walk through the door. they each individually take in the sights and the smells. seth is the first to say something.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{now this is my kinda place! i could become a regular.}
<A>__{the man behind the bar is razor charlie. he eyes the group as they approach. their difference from the usual road waif nomads who populate the twister disturbs him. he exchanges a knowing look across the room with big emilio, as the group bellies up to the bar.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{whiskey!}
<C>__{razor charlie}
<P>__{(in english)}
<D>__{you can't come in here.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{what dya mean?}
<C>__{razor charlie}
<D>__{this is a private club. you're not welcome.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{are you tellin' me i'm not good enough to drink here?}
<C>__{razor charlie}
<D>__{this bar is for bikers and truckers only.}
<P>__{(points his finger to seth)}
<D>__{you, get out!}
<A>__{big emilio almost magically appears behind seth and places his big beefy sausage fingered hand hard on seth's shoulder.}
<C>__{big emilio}
<P>__{(to seth in spanish)}
<D>__{walk, pendaho.}
<A>__{seth slowly turns his eyes to the big hand on his shoulder.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(low)}
<D>__{take your hand off me.}
<C>__{big emilio}
<P>__{(spanish)}
<D>__{i'm going to count to three.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{no, i'm going to count to three.}
<C>__{big emilio}
<D>__{uno...}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{two..}
<A>__{jacob jumps in the middle.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{now wait a minute, there's no reason to get ugly. there's just a misunderstanding going on here. you said this bar is for truckers and bikers, well, i'm a truck driver.}
<A>__{everybody looks at jacob. as jacob talks he takes out his wallet.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{if you look outside your door, parked in your parking lot, you'll see a big ass recreational vehicle. that's mine. in order to drive that legally, you need a class two driver's license. that is the same license that the dmv requires truck drivers to carry in order to drive a truck.}
<P>__{(he takes the license out}
<D>__{of his wallet and lays it}
<P>__{on the bar)}
<D>__{that is me, and this is my class two license. this is a truck driver's bar, i am a truck driver, and these are my friends.}
<A>__{everybody's a little stunned after jacob's speech. razor charlie picks up the license, looks at jacob, looks at everyone in the party and smiles.}
<C>__{razor charlie}
<P>__{(to jacob)}
<D>__{welcome to the titty twister. what can i get you?}
<A>__{seth brushes off big emilio's paw.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{bottle of whiskey and five glasses.}
<A>__{razor charlie's eyes go to seth. even though he has a big smile on his face, he looks like he's going to kill seth. but instead he just says,}
<C>__{razor charlie}
<D>__{coming right up.}
<A>__{razor charlie goes for the bottle. big emilio gives the party one last look and walks away. richard gives jacob a buddy punch on the shoulder.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{good job, pops.}
<A>__{seth's still frying an egg on his head.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{that's just fuckin' typical. biggest number one problem with mexico, it's not service oriented. i was feelin' so good, and those fuckin' spies brought me down.}
<A>__{richard puts his arm around seth.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{fuck 'em, shake it off.}
<A>__{razor charlie brings the bottle and the glasses. seth looks at the guy, still pissed.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{you serve food, jose?}
<A>__{razor charlie knows seth's taunting him with a racial slur, but he just smiles and says,}
<C>__{razor charlie}
<D>__{best in mexico.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i kinda doubt that. we're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.}
<A>__{seth walks away, and the group follows him. we just hang on the evil wheels turning inside of razor charlie's head. the five of them move across the floor to a table. as they walk, kate attracts stares, wolf whistles and rude comments from some of the patrons. jacob keeps near his daughter. the dancers do their sexy routines. a big chested, wild haired blonde catches scott's eye. she winks at him. richard leans over and whispers in scott's ear.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{anytime you want a lap dance with that broad, say the word. it's on me, kiddo.}
<A>__{he gives the boy's neck a squeeze. jacob's eyes survey the surroundings. big emilio and razor charlie quietly exchange words about the party in spanish.}
<C>__{razor charlie}
<P>__{(in spanish)}
<D>__{they're not the normal road trash we normally feed on. but it'll be okay. no one knows they're here.}
<A>__{the five of them find a table and sit down. seth, still in a bad mood, takes the cork out of the whiskey bottle and tosses it. he pours richie and himself a glass.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{who else?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{pass.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(picking a fight)}
<D>__{why not, against your religion?}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(won't be baited)}
<D>__{no, i do drink, i'm just not drinking now.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{suit yourself, more for me.}
<P>__{(to scott)}
<D>__{scotty?}
<A>__{scott shakes his head no.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(to kate)}
<D>__{how 'bout you?}
<P>__{(pointing at scott and kate)}
<D>__{are safer in here with us than wandering around a mexican border town all night long. just don't do nothin' stupid and we'll all get along fine.}
<P>__{(to scott)}
<D>__{scotty, you sure you don't want a drink?}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{okay, i will have one.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no you won't.}
<A>__{seth pours scott a shot.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{sorry, pops, but i'm drinkin' and i don't like drinkin' alone. bottoms up, boy.}
<A>__{scott takes the drink and he, too, experiences an on drinker's tremor. seth turns to kate.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{how about you, cutie pie? ready for round two?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{seth just passes her the bottle. she pours her own shot and knocks it back.}
<C>__{richard}
<P>__{(to seth)}
<D>__{hey, dr. frankenstein, i think you just created a monster.}
<A>__{jacob turns to seth and asks quietly.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{why are you so agitated?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. and that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{he backed down.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{he's smilin' at us. but behind his smile, he's sayin', "fuck you jack." i hear that loud and clear.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what are you going to do?}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(picking up the whiskey bottle)}
<D>__{i'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. and when i've drunk the last drop, if i still feel then, the way i feel now, i'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. that means you, too.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(tossing it off)}
<D>__{i never said do what i do, i said do what i say.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{are you so much a fucking loser, you can't tell when you've won?}
<A>__{richard, kate and scott both turn to jacob. nobody can believe what he just said. neither can seth who calmly lays down his drinking glass.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{what did you call me?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{nothing. i didn't make a statement. i asked a question. would you like me to ask it again? very well. are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{the entire state of texas, along with the fbi, is looking for you. did they find you? no. they couldn't. they had every entrance to the border covered. there's no way you could get across. did you? yes, you did. you've won, seth, enjoy it.}
<A>__{seth looks at jacob, then picks up the bottle.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{jacob, i want you to have a drink with me. i insist.}
<A>__{jacob slides his empty glass over to seth. seth pours booze in jacob's glass and his own. both men pick up the glasses.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{to your family.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{to yours.}
<A>__{they both knock 'em back and slap the empty glasses down.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{now, is your shit together?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{forever together.}
<A>__{seth turns to scott.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{in that camper out there i saw a guitar. i take it that's yours.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{yeah, it's mine.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{go out and bring it in. i feel a song coming on.}
