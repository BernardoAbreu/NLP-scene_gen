<A>__{geoff appears from the garage with his bike and takes off for the road. a whistle catches his ear. drew is at the edge of the woods, beckoning for geoff. geoff circles around and doubles back.}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{i was just going by your house. where's your bike?}
<A>__{the closer geoff gets, the more he sees of drew's despair. then he sees the dried blood staining drew's clothes.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{zowie's dead.}
<A>__{geoff's heart sinks. an unspoken moment of sympathy passes between the boys. fighting the emotions, drew finally speaks.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i have to bury him. i don't want to go out there alone.}
<A>__{there's such grief in drew's words that geoff can't resist. he glances toward his house to make sure he hasn't been seen, then blends into the woods.}
