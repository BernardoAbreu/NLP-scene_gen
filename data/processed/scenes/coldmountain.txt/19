<L>__{exterior confederate lines. night}
<A>__{a beautiful night. lots of stars. inman and three others, including butcher, slide over the top of the trench, far to one side of the stand of trees. the plan is to cast a wide arc that will bring them around back of the trees, closer to the enemy side than their own. the four men slither over the ground. they pause. inman has arrived at a tangle of corpses. he slithers over them. they work their way towards the trees. there are a half dozen federals crouching in the cover of the trees. they are dozing. only one of them sits with a rifle surveying the confederate lines, the others have their backs to the enemy, sitting against the trunks, grabbing a few minute's sleep. as the four rebels approach, still crawling, one of the federals opens his eyes, sees the attack, shifts for his rifle. inman immediately stands up, firing instantly, killing him and two others, while butcher throws himself at another. the exchanges are brief and savage and one of inman's party and all of the federals lay dead. then the rebels break from the trees. a flare goes up, then another, both from the confederate trenches. inman and his accomplices are picked out in a brilliant green light. shots follow, from both sides, aimed at the three returning men as they zigzag towards their own lines. as they get close, voices cry out, rippling down the trench, joining their own admonitions: don't shoot, hold your fire, they're our boys, hold your fire!!! they're almost home. butcher is laughing, whooping. then just as suddenly he falls, wounded. inman stops, turns back, runs to him. inman collects butcher, drags him, carries him. they're fifty yards from their lines. a bullet catches inman in the neck. he goes down like a tree, blood pouring from his neck. lying on the ground, he watches the phosphorescent lights slowly fade to black, all sound fading with them.}
