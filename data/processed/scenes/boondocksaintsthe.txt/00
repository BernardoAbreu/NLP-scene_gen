<A>__{as we open we see the inside of an enormous church. a young looking priest in his mid thirties is finishing the delivery of the lords prayer. in the back of the church, in the last pew, there are two who kneel on the cold, stone floor. they do not stand to sing, nor do they offer signs of peace when told, but they pray. they grip and rub their rosaries. they mutter their words in latin. connor and murphy macmanus (mid twenties) are shrouded in thick waist length navy p coats, worn leather boots and the hungry clothes of the poor. the boys heads are shaved and they have facial hair.}

<D>__{thank you father macklepenny, for coming all the way across town to be our guest speaker today. i hope you found our little parish to your liking.}
<A>__{macklepenny takes his seat on the alter along side the regular priests of the church. the macmanus brothers suddenly stand, as all others remain seated. each church goer between them and the aisle shifts his her position to allow the boys passage, as if on command. the two turn and begin to stride for the alter, eyes down, determined.}

<D>__{they've never been like anyone else. from the moment they were born, of the same womb, on the same day, they just had their own way, my boys did. and i always knew that one day they would do something of true greatness. i just never expected they would bring about such a... such a reckoning.}
<A>__{the macmanus brothers are fraternal twins. as annabelle macmanus speaks, macklepenny is taken aback as he scans the congregation amazed to find that he is the only one who thinks this out of the ordinary. the monsignor begins his sermon. macklepenny rises to stop the boys from this disgraceful disturbance. the elder clergyman finds macklepenny's arm, keeping him seated while shaking his head. macklepenny's confusion gives way to awe as he watches the brothers step onto the altar, brush by the six seated priests, and approach the enormous crucifix. they both fall to their knees and kiss the feet of christ. they rise and as abruptly as they came, they turn and head back down the aisle for the front door. they stop at the rear of the church, turning to listen to the sermon.}

<P>__{(loud, authoritative)}
<D>__{...and i am reminded of this holy day of the sad story of kitty geneviese. this poor soul cried out time and time again for help but no person answered her calls. though many saw, not one so much as called. her assailant wiped the bloody knife off on her lifeless little body. they watched as he simply walked away. nobody wanted to get involved. nobody wanted to take a stand... we must fear evil men and deal with them accordingly but what we must truly guard against, what we must fear most}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{is the indifference of good men.}
<A>__{the macmanuses turn and walk out the door.}
