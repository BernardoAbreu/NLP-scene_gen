<A>__{elizabeth flips the pages of schuyler's notebook page after page of psychotic looking scribbling, dense underlines, many exclamation points. on one page " c ruel r andom s hit." wider a few business people read papers, pick at eggs; a large screen tv plays morning programs. schuyler stares at elizabeth, awaiting reaction... she seems incapable of speech. he puts the tiny radio and earplug on the table between them.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{this is one of their devices, i pulled it off their assassin in the subway. it's how they communicate with each other.}
<A>__{elizabeth picks the thing up, studies it, puts the plug to her ear.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{it's... a radio...}
<A>__{schuyler waves dismissively, "you don't understand," takes the radio back from her and pockets it.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{i can't find the right channel... listen, i may not make it through this if anything happens, get that notebook to, to, the press, or the fbi or something. someone you can trust, i don't know, assuming you can trust anyone . i just want you to know i'm not crazy, and i didn't kill myself, no matter what they say }
<A>__{she stares at him, trying to be strong, but she's very freaked out. a barmaid brings their order. schuyler stares at the barmaid suspiciously as she puts a cup of coffee before elizabeth, and gives him a bottle of water and a glass. he tests the seal.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{has this been opened?}
<C>__{barmaid}
<D>__{no sir. just like you said.}
<A>__{he watches her as she retreats, leans toward elizabeth, puts his hand on top of her cup.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{i don't think coffee is safe.}
<A>__{schuyler opens the bottle and drinks straight from it thirstily. elizabeth registers the clinking handcuffs on his left wrist.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{schuyler, try and listen to me. i love you, i always have, i always will. and maybe this is... good. maybe this a point you had to reach, before }
<C>__{schuyler}
<P>__{(staring at her)}
<D>__{before what?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{before i'm just glad you came to me for help. i don't know if i'm strong enough to, to handle this on my own but i know a lot of excellent crisis people }
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{crisis people. crisis people?}
<A>__{a cell phone rings in her purse, she makes an exasperated noise and pulls it out, with a "one sec" gesture at schuyler. he rises during her conversation, a new look on his face he can't trust her either.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{hello? hi, hon, i'm ok... um, could i call you back...?}
<A>__{schuyler's distracted by something on the tv... he lets out a strangled cry. elizabeth turns her head to see. on tv screen it's jim feingold, clutching his head, rubbing his temples with a look of pain. cheesy music, throbbing spfx. schuyler approaches the set, shouting at it.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{you bastard! you fucking bastard! how did you find me here!?}
<A>__{elizabeth gets up, tries to pull him back to the booth, he pushes her away, not taking his eyes from the set. patrons react nervously to the deranged man.}
<P>__{feingold (on tv, filter)}
<D>__{ooof my head is killing me!}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{fuck you!}
<A>__{the tv image widens, a commercial actress rubs feingold's neck.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{who are you ?}
<P>__{actress (on tv, filter)}
<D>__{honey, have you taken anything?}
<P>__{feingold (on tv, filter)}
<D>__{sure, some aspirin }
<A>__{the actress clucks her tongue, shakes her head. schuyler's starting to get the picture.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{he's an actor...}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{of course he's an actor, it's a commercial.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<P>__{(a revelation)}
<D>__{he's just a fucking actor...}
<A>__{on tv feingold holds up a colorfully marked bottle of pills, studies them with a shit eating grin. soothing music.}
<P>__{feingold (on tv, filter)}
<D>__{my head feels great! thanks to ambutol, i will never use aspirin again!}
<A>__{feingold gives way to the image of a box of ambutol. schuyler lets elizabeth escort him back near the booth. he's completely absorbed in his own thoughts.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{have you taken something?}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{are you on drugs?}
<A>__{he shakes his head, waves his hand dismissively. he's thinking about something else. elizabeth starts dialing.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{schuyler, i'm calling a friend right now, i want you to wait here with me until }
<A>__{schuyler tries to sound normal, claps her on the arm. while he talks, camera finds schuyler's other hand, which slips stealthily into her purse, lying on the seat of the booth.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{elizabeth, please... i'm sorry, i'ii be alright, it's just been a hard day... listen, i gotta use the restroom, be right back }
<A>__{he moves quickly down a corridor marked restrooms and emergency exit. she looks after him, quite puzzled, phone still to her ear.}
