<D>__{quick! use your coo coo gun !}
<A>__{barney aims, pulls back the plunger... too late! the elevator is gone. the cable swings back and forth loosely, "whapping" the shaft walls as it shoots upwards. fred dives for the cable, misses! as he stumbles, barney leaps on fred's back, catches the cable! as barney starts to whizz upwards, fred garbs onto his ankles! above fibresphere propelled upwards, the would be rescuers shoot out of the frame, disappear into the fibresphere with a crash!}
