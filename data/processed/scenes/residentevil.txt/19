<A>__{jill's voice stutters over a headset which is pressed against a man's ear.}
<C>__{jill }
<D>__{under attack... by.. .assailants... unidentifi...}
<A>__{static. hissing air. the shot widens as the man lowers his headset. first we see the tattoo on his arm... a grinning skull which we recognize. then, gradually, we see his face. lean and mean, wearing dark sunglasses, this is albert wesker, a hard assed career officer.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{can you get a trace?}
<A>__{the pilot, laguardia, responds.}
<C>__{laguardia}
<D>__{lost the beacon. it just cut out. like it was...swallowed by something.}
<A>__{oddly, wesker smiles.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{i do believe, gentlemen...that we're gonna be earning some combat pay.}
<A>__{there are three other men on board. the closest to wesker is barry burton, a muscular black man, as big as a grizzly, with the heart of a teddy.}

<D>__{damn, if you don't love a fight.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{hey, if i didn't... you'd be a dead man. (to the pilot) call in a nine nine. i want raccoon city e vacked.}
<A>__{wesker and the men fly from the lens. the camera passes out through one of the helicopter's windows as the chopper soars away. when the shot widens, we see other hueys...black, unmarked, keeping formation. three... six...ten of them.}
