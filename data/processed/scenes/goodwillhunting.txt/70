<A>__{lambeau and sean, having finished their meal. lambeau has been pitching sean.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{i've been busy, gerry. i got a full schedule.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{this kid's special, sean. i've never seen anything like him.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{not much free time, gerry.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{have you ever heard of a man named ramanujan?}
<A>__{sean nods his head.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{he was alive over a hundred years ago. he was indian. dots, not feathers...}
<A>__{sean finishes the joke. lambeau chuckles.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{so this ramanujan lived in a tiny hut in india. no formal education, no access to other works. but he came across an old math book and from this basic text he was able to extrapolate theories that had baffled mathematicians for years.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{and he mailed it to hardy }
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{that's right, sean. he mailed it to a professor at cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought ramanujan to england.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age }
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{they worked together for the remainder of their lives, producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done. ramanujan's genius was unparalleled, sean. this boy is like that. but he's very defensive and i need someone who can get through to him.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{why me?}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{i need someone with your kind of background.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{my kind of background?}

<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{just meet with the boy once a week.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{can we do it at my office?}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{that would be fine.}
<A>__{the waiter comes with the check. each man reaches for it.}
