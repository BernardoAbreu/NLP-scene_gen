<A>__{a bare light bulb; a scratchy vinyl record on a turn table. poomina watches max do a sleight of hand trick with a coin. he tosses it up, brings his hands past each other, then holds out his fists; she picks on... but the other holds the penny. fooled, she laughs. he does it again; she points to one fist empty then other also empty. max reaches behind her ear and... produces the coin. she loves it, her laughter escalating. but then she seesm to read something in the b.g. where we see four thugs, two of whom will become known to us as the goonda, a capo to the local "mafia" chieftan, and ashoka, son of the local godfather. ashoka works on a pimple on his chin. the goonda meticulously cleans a spot of mud with spit from one of his expensive new running shoes. max eyes the thugs eyeing him.}

<D>__{short guys! quit lookin' at us!}
<A>__{this remark goes over big with the thugs. max doesn't care. he knocks off the last of the beer in his bottle. the bartender brings them two shots of something in two unmatched glasses.}
<C>__{poomina}
<D>__{special drink for you, sahib. only the most man can drink it. you make try. for me.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{for you, i would drink battery acid.}
<C>__{poomina}
<D>__{who that finish first. i bet!}
<A>__{she puts her glass to her lips and, in a childish, exaggerated way, mimes waiting for him to commence a drinking race with her. the two of them toss off what's in their glasses. the bangla in max's glass is stronger than battery acid. he does an elaborate routine involv ing the pain, the surprise, the sheer awfulness of the drink. but puts it down with mock machismo.}
<C>__{poomina}
<D>__{i beat!}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i really don't think so oh no, nay, nay! i never lose the truly irrelevant contest.}
<C>__{poomina}
<D>__{we have fun some more. i bet again!}
<A>__{she turns to the bartender, calls for two more. all the while, in the b.g., the goonda and his two thugs watch emotionlessly and ashoka works on his acne.}
