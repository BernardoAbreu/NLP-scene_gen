<A>__{the officer curses under his breath and proceeds. he stops in front of a dyna panhard, parked not too far away. the boy moves on a few yards past the automobile until he reaches a metallic wastebasket which is fastened to the pole of a street lamp. he stops there, then glances around. the officer is not far behind him; he has taken his car keys from his pocket, and is about to open the car door. the boy plunges his hand into the basket, rummages among the torn papers, then suddenly turns, points a revolver at the officer's back, and shoots. the man tries to clutch something, but slips and falls down. the boy shoots again at the man on the ground, then plunges his hand again into the wastebasket, drops the revolver, and glances around him. he breaks into a run. the policemen come out of the police station hurriedly. whistles, orders, excited cries. they turn the corner. some rush to the man lying on the ground. others jump into a jeep. four of them jump on motorcycles that are lined up in the rack. they move off in two directions. at the same time, wails of police sirens moving nearer are heard in the distance. the street is deserted. there is no trace of the boy. people are seen at their windows. the officer is lifted by his arms. an ambulance arrives and stops, its siren at full blast, its doors wide open. the officer is placed inside. the motorcycles are racing through the sidestreets. the jeep converges on them, then reverses its direction, moving while balanced on two wheels. passersby stop to watch, all of them europeans. the siren's wail is at a high pitch.}
