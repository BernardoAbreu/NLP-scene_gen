<A>__{we recognize the room as jerry's old bedroom, empty except for a bed stripped of it's sheets, a naked pillow, a beat up dresser with a small tv on top of it, and a few posters and scraps of trash that have been left behind. jimmy and rj are looking across the room at sinjin, a young african american male about rj's age, with an average build, sharply dressed in a button down, and sport coat. sinjin has his back to jimmy, and is bouncing up and down on a rusty old pogo stick his behavior constituting a sharp contrast to his stylish threads. louie, an overweight, slobbish caucasian male a few years older than sinjin, sits in a rickety old wheelchair that might creak even more than sinjin's pogo stick in louie's lap rests a bowling ball bag. upon seeing sinjin and louie, jimmy fondles his water bottle nervously. he turns around to watch rj closing the door behind them.}
