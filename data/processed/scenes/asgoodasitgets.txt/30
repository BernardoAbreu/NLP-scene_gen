<A>__{melvin finishing a plate of eggs, bacon and sausage with his plastic knife and fork. carol looks totally beat as she sets down a cup of coffee. melvin is craning periodically to keep an eye of his dog.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{so what are you doing with a dog?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{suckered in. set up. pushed around.}

<D>__{you're not worried that someone might take him?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{well, not until now for christ's sake.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{it's okay i will sit here.}
<A>__{he changes tables for the first time ever so that he can keep an eye on verdell. carol is amazed.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{you know he's a little dog. next time, if bryan's not here, you can bring him in.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{how old are you?}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{oh, please...}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{if i had to guess by your eyes, i'd say you were fifty.}
<A>__{carol looks at him.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{and if i had to guess by your eyes. i'd say you were kind. so, so much for eyes. but as long as you bring up age... how old are you?}
<C>__{melvin}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{otherwise, you're not ugly.}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(laughs out loud)}
<D>__{okay, pal... i accept the compliment, but go easy my knees start a knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{what's with the dark?}
<A>__{he indicates the bags under her eyes by tapping his own.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{dawn patrol major dawn patrol. my son had a full blown attack. and this time, for extra fun, they gave us the wrong antibiotics, so i get him home...}
<A>__{she reaches for the plate of uneaten bacon he goes nuts.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{no... no... leave it... the bacon's for the dog.}
<A>__{she is jolted by the insensitivity of his interruption, but he doesn't notice, turning, almost chatty.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{last week i was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so i decide i'm going to make a little joke...}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{you all set here?}
<A>__{melvin nods a bit frustrated about not being able to finish his dog story. he pockets the remaining bacon.}
