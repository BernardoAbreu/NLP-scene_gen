<D>__{74, 75, 76.... seventy six guests.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{seventy five sounds better. "a small, wedding of seventy five guests."}
<A>__{carrie looks at the list.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{as a wedding gift, charlotte had given me anthony marantino friend and wedding planner.}
<A>__{carrie crosses someone off. charlotte reacts, shocked.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{what? she was borderline anyway.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{cut throat i love it. i hope you're that decisive when it comes to the location and the dress.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{oh. i found the dress.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{what?! when?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{the other day. i have it here.}
<A>__{carrie gets up and goes into the closet. anthony hurries over and sits next to charlotte.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{this is going to be good!}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{i'm so excited!}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{here it is.}
<A>__{anthony and charlotte grab hands in anticipation as carrie comes out of her closet. she holds up a simple off white vintage suit. charlotte and anthony deflate.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{well... that was the exact reaction i was aiming for.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{no, it's pretty but it's so simple.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{simple and classic. when i saw it i just thought: that is what i should marry big in.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{well, who's it by? the label?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{no one. i found it in a vintage shop.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{"the bride wore a dress by no one."}
<A>__{she turns and heads back into the closet.}
<C>__{carrie}
<P>__{(as she goes)}
<D>__{don't worry, i will style it up with shoes.}
<A>__{anthony turns to charlotte and says in a low voice.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{the invitation is fancier than the dress.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{i heard that.}
