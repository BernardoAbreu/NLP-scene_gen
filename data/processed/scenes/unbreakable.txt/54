<A>__{three chairs have been placed on the walkway in front of the bay window of the store. the words, "limited edition" are etched in the window. david, jeremy and elijah are seated watching the people stroll by. elijah's cane is on his lap. jeremy sips a drink in a paper cup.}

<D>__{i fractured my leg. it's the fifth time i've done that particular bone. it didn't really heal well this time.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{raise your hand is you're wondering who the hell breaks the same bone five times?}
<A>__{jeremy and david raise their hands.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{i have something called osteogenesis imperfecta. it's a genetic disorder. i don't make this particular type of protein very well and it makes my bones very low in density, very easy to break. i've had fifty four breaks in my life. i have the tamest version of the disorder... type one.}

<C>__{david}
<D>__{skeptical about what?}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{your answer to my question. it's one thing to have never been injured in your life, but to state that you've never taken ill, well that's a whole new level.}
