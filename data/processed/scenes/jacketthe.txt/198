<A>__{starks collapses on the familiar slab, ready to be strapped into the jacket one final time. blood pours from his head onto the floor. the person with him struggles to get all of starks' weight onto the metal slab. she's doing it as carefully, and gently, as she can taking observable care with every strap of the jacket, almost as if the act itself is a humane one. when the hands finally reach the straps around his neck and the hardest part of the struggle has passed, starks smiles kindly, and thankfully, into the single overhead light in the room that obscures the face of the person strapping him in. as the drawer is pushed in, one of the straps gets caught on the side, cutting starks' arm. we hear a small cry in the room. then the hands adjust the strap and slowly push starks in.}
