<L>__{interior living room malahide's house day}
<A>__{in contrast to the secret and private obsession room, this room is the tasteful and upmarket room of the successful professional. it is a long spacious room with modern furniture and white walls. the walls are mostly free of decoration save for two or three large canvases of abstract art. the longest wall is broken up only by a low circular table, which rests against it about half way down. on this table is a very simple black vase containing a spray of beautiful white lilies. above this vase on the wall is a large frameless mirror. as malahide enters, the first thing he sees is a bloody palm print on one of his white walls. he blinks at it and looks down into the room. we cut to: ; julia. at first it seems she is staring at the lilies, but as we track around her, we realise she is staring at the reflection of her skinned self. her face snarls at herself, she roars with rage, forms her hand into a fist and shatters the mirror. malahide rushes towards her. she swings round and freezes him with a glance. they hold their positions for a moment, malahide nervous and julia furious, and then julia makes herself relax. she sighs, takes a few deep breaths, and then speaks.}
