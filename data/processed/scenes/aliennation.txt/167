<L>__{exterior abandoned drawbridge night}
<A>__{the end of the bridge is in the "up" position... a huge asphalt slab stabbing up into the night sky. harcourt runs along the pools of light and dark at the edge of the bridge, the black seawater drifting past beside him. his foot slips once and he almost goes over the side. sykes backlit by the burning cars, the big casull a prominent part of the silhouette just keeps coming. harcourt reaches the shadows at the end of the bridge and has nowhere to go. he is backed into a corner, with seawater on two side of him. harcourt pivots frantically, sees sykes coming this way. harcourt is a trapped animal. his chest heaves in panic. then his gaze falls on the suitcase behind him... and slowly... finally... a look of resolve comes into his eye.}
<B>__{on sykes}
<A>__{he eases cautiously toward the shadows where he knows harcourt is. there's some movement among the shadows, and sykes straight arms the casull, his finger white against the trigger. perspiration drips into sykes' eye, but he doesn't blink. a long moment then angle the shadows harcourt emerges from the darkness. his face is composed, the superior glint is back in his eye. his arms are held away from his sides at 30 degree angles, clearly in surrender. sykes cat steps forward slowly. harcourt stares at sykes' eyes, and the desire there that harcourt will give him an excuse. harcourt simply... smiles.}

<A>__{and now sykes sees it harcourt has been holding one of the one kilo glass cylinders of the drug concealed behind his arm. he brings it up over his head, grins at sykes, then tilts back his head and cracks the cylinder open. the blue gel pours into his mouth and down his chin. his mouth fills. he looks back at sykes, making eye contact... his eyes mad, defiant. and he swallows. long hold then the wallop of the overdose hits him... his face contorts in agony as he begins to convulse. sykes, wide eyed, lowers the casull and watches as harcourt drops to the ground and goes into a massive violent seizure. his limbs hammer against the deck... his back arches fiercely. it is a brutal, agonizing ten seconds. then, finally, his body becomes still. sykes, stunned at what he's just witnessed slowly goes to him and takes his pulse the way he saw jetson do it. high angle shot the entire area sykes stands. he notices the suitcase nearby, latches it, and hefts it. he carries it with him back toward the inferno of the wrecked cars, the casull hanging heavy and cold in his hand.}
<B>__{angle following sykes}
<A>__{he approaches the burning cars, heading for jetson. as he passes the burning cars, we have a half second to register that the driver's door of the police unit is now open before a dark figure hurtles at sykes' back from o.s.! sykes is thrown forward. the suitcase crashes to the ground, and the casull goes skittering off. sykes looks up to be met by the singed and bleeding nightmare visage of kipling! kipling reaches down for the suitcase then sykes hears it the telltale clinking sound. he looks and sees the exotic silver bracelet on kipling's wrist. it connects for him; this is the bandana alien the one who killed bill tuggle! kipling brings the suitcase above his head. he is a half second from hurling it down on sykes' skull when a gun roars. kipling is thrown back by the chest wound. sykes looks.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{jetson, half sitting up, holds the smoking casull. kipling recovers enough to come at sykes again with the suitcase again. jetson, shaking but determined, fires again, and again, and again. kipling is driven backward by the fusillade, the suitcase still over his head... until he is blasted at last and forever, suitcase and all, into the molten core of the inferno. sykes rises, makes his way to jetson's side. jetson has let the weight of the gun carry his hand to the ground. sykes kneels beside him, gently taking the gun from the alien's hand. the two partners remain like this, bathed in the orange flickering glow of the fire.}
