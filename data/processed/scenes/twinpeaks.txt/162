<L>__{145. interior leland's car day}
<A>__{leland and laura drive along. leland becomes preoccupied with something in his rear view mirror. laura turns to see a car erratically coming up behind them. leland slows down and stops for a red light at sparkwood and twenty one. in front of them is a huge logging truck. laura smells something.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{dad, is the engine on fire? something is burning.}
<A>__{leland turns and gives her a look. the car that was tailing them races around them, races around the logging truck, and comes back around stopping on leland's side of the car. leland spots gerard, the one armed man, behind the wheel sweating like crazy.}
<C>__{laura }
<D>__{something is burning.}
<A>__{leland starts to rev his engine while holding the brake with his left foot.}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{it's the engine.}
<C>__{gerard}
<D>__{you stole the corn. i had it canned above the store.}
<A>__{leland is panicked. the car is slowly screeching towards the large lumber truck in front of them.}
<C>__{gerard}
<P>__{(shouting at laura)}
<D>__{miss, the look on her face when it was opened. there was a closeness. like the formica table top.}
<A>__{the car is now smoking and making a horrendous sound. gerard continues to yell, but we can barely hear it.}
<C>__{gerard}
<D>__{the thread will be torn, mr. palmer, the thread will be torn.}
<A>__{leland turns to laura. sweat pours from his forehead. while leland is turned away, gerard holds up his hand with a ring on the little finger. he is shouting over the engine noise and the horn which leland has begun to blow frantically.}
<C>__{gerard}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{it's him. it's your father.}
<A>__{laura can't make this out over the noise. the light turns green. gerard takes off away from them. as soon as the logging truck moves leland lets go of the brake and the car flies into a service station on their right. everyone around there has been watching a commotion on a sunday afternoon.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{dad!... what was that all about? who was that?}
<A>__{a young mechanic runs up to their car.}
<C>__{mechanic}
<D>__{mr., mr., you shouldn't do that to your engine. you ought to take it easy, mr., you're going to burn your engine out.}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{what the hell was all that? why doesn't someone do something about all of this. my god, that guy came out of nowhere. he was harassing my daughter.}
<A>__{leland stares at laura trying to compose himself.}
