<A>__{his wizened face, pale. right now, though, his eyes have a sparkle as he watches three million dollars in cold cash being counted on a card table in front of him. his brother sam is present, and the sandy haired courier, a little nervous; the one who had left from the tropicana with the corleone skim money. also johnny ola. the money is evidently all there; roth picks up a packet; probably a hundred thousand dollars, and throws it over to the courier.}

<C>__{courier}
<P>__{(frightened)}
<D>__{what about the arrangements? how can i be sure about the arrangements?}
<C>__{ola}
<D>__{relax. you're under our protection; the corleone family will never find you.}
<A>__{ola leads the courier to the adjoining room where two smartly dressed military (cuban) police are standing, and a civilian. the courier sees them, looks back to ola. one of the police steps forward, placing the courier under arrest; handcuffing him.}
<C>__{courier}
<D>__{hey, what's this?}
<A>__{the other takes the packet of money, and hands it to the civilian, who places it in the briefcase he carries. the other officer kneels down and fastens leg manacles.}

<D>__{the arrangements... you bastards! what...}
<A>__{the captain strikes him expertly across the side of his head with his pistol. ola closes the door on this scene.}
