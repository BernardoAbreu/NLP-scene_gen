<L>__{exterior marion's house night}
<A>__{quiet. dark. marion stands on the front porch, looking out into the night, listening, hearing nothing. he glances up at the star filled sky, tracking his eyes from the big dipper to the north star. behind the house, a figure in the darkness, carrying a musket, moves from shadow to shadow.}
<L>__{interior kitchen night}
<A>__{margaret and samuel and william talk, their voices low.}
<C>__{samuel}
<D>__{they're going to come.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{quiet.}
<C>__{samuel}
<D>__{we're going to have to fight them off.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{father will do that.}
<C>__{samuel}
<D>__{they'll probably kill us men and do lord knows what to you women.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{samuel!}
<A>__{a sound. they all stop. something moved behind the kitchen. margaret silently eases the others out of the room, through the darkened hall toward their father. suddenly in front of them, a bloody figure big. hulking. in uniform. margaret screams. william and samuel cry out. the figure moves toward them... marion, on the porch, hears the scream, races into the house. he sees the figure, moves toward it... the figure moves into the light... marion sees the bloodied face...}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{gabriel!}
<A>__{gabriel is wounded, battered and dirty. he carries a musket and a dispatch case. he sways. marion catches him and eases him to a seat.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{you're hurt.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{the battle, were you there?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{margaret, get bandages and water. thomas, the porch, eyes open.}
<A>__{marion checks gabriel's wounds which are nasty but not life threatening.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{have you seen any redcoats?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{not yet. what happened?}
<A>__{margaret brings water and linen to marion who expertly cleans gabriel's wounds and applies field dressings.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{it wasn't like saratoga. there, we stayed in the trees, but this time gates marched us straight at the redcoats. they fired two volleys into us and we broke like straw. i was given these dispatches... i saw virginia regulars surrender... as they laid down their weapons the british green dragoons rode into them and hacked them to bits... killed them all, over two hundred men.}
<A>__{marion's appalled.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{they had surrendered?}
<A>__{gabriel nods. marion's stunned. gabriel tries to rise.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i have to get these dispatches to hillsboro.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{you're in no condition to ride.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i have no choice, i...}
<A>__{gabriel passes out. marion catches him and carries him to a day bed in the parlor. as marion lays him down, they hear heavy musket fire, very close. marion hurries to the door and looks out into the night, the children cluster around him, seeing a strange sight.}
<B>__{a skirmish in the field below the house}
<A>__{pitch black. then a musket fires, creating a flash of light that illuminates a tableau of soldiers, about three dozen redcoats and as many patriots. the strobe of the musket shot provides targets for an ensuing volley of shots in every direction. then darkness, punctuated by screams of pain, confused hollering and the rustling of armed men in movement. then the pattern repeats itself: a musket fires, illuminating a tableau of targets for another murderous}
<B>__{volley of shots.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{margaret, take william and susan down to the root cellar. thomas, go to the back porch. nathan and samuel, the side windows. keep out of sight.}
<A>__{they hurry off. marion steps into the house and opens his gun cabinet. he extracts two pistols and a pair of muskets. then he steps back to the front door. he waits and watches.}
