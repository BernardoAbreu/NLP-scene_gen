<D>__{what kinds of things does he want you to say, elaine?}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{well, he wants me to call him 'big boy.' and he's my bucking bronco, and i'm supposed to ride him hard and put him back in the barn wet.}
<A>__{michael's laughter is heard coming through the vent. ben closes his eyes and sighs deeply.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{are you all right, dr. sobol?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{let me suggest something, elaine. if the man wants you to say things ... damn it, you should get down on all fours and bark like a dog if that's going to get the job done. break out the wine, baby. smoke a jointerior do what you have to do, because life is too short. it's just too fucking short.}
<A>__{elaine stares, taken aback, then she smiles.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{okay.}
