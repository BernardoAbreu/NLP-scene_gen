<L>__{interior level ten, the night room }
<B>__{a spotlight}
<A>__{comes on, isolating alex. the boy stands behind her, and everything else is dark. it's impossible to tell how large the room is. it might go on forever.}
<B>__{more lights}
<A>__{come on now, pin point spots illuminating the faces of her friends. they're all there...stilts, laurie, the others. even nick. they sit in rows, motionless...a peanut gallery. it's eerie as hell. and now, alex sees something else, greg. he's encased in a block of ice. a frozen prince. and in his hands he holds a sword. the sword is very unusual. the hilt is shaped like a heart and it glows red as if it had just pulled from a furnace. alex realizes that the sword is arcade's heart. alex moves towards greg. as she gets closer, she sees a keyhole carved into the ice. alex knows what to do. she withdraws her belt on which the nine golden keys are attached. removing the keys, alex begins to fit them together...one, two, three...until they combine to form the shape of a single, greater key.}
<B>__{the key}
<A>__{alex fits it into the keyhole and turns it.}
<B>__{the case of ice}
<A>__{splits in half, opening up with a cloud of frosty air. inside, greg is frozen still, clutching the sword. alex pulls the sword out of his stiff grip, lifting it up.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{okay. i'm here, arcade. where are you?}
<A>__{no answer. alex turns, eyes searching through the darkness.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{where are you, damnit?!}
<A>__{her voice echoes in the cavernous room.}
<C>__{arcade }
<D>__{right here, bitch.}
<A>__{alex spins around and...}
<B>__{the boy}
<A>__{stands before her. he grins and his eyes pulse with an internal light. we can hear him breathing now, just like before. just like the game.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{you...you're arcade? but the donor... arcade boy ...was an eight year old boy. you see, mommy used to beat me. mommy threw me down a flight of stairs. then i went to sleep for a long, long time, and when i woke up, i was here, and i wasn't me anymore...}
<P>__{(shivers)}
<D>__{...and i fucked mommy up good...}
<A>__{arcade begins to change, shaking and roaring as something black and insect like bursts out of the boy's skin. it claws at its face, ripping the flesh away and revealing something altogether awful underneath. nothing could have prepared alex for this. it arcade rises above her and it takes every ounce of her courage to keep from screaming. somehow, alex finds a reserve of strength. alex swings the sword and... arcade smashes it aside. it clatters to the floor, useless. but that's academic now as a gnarled hand clamps around alex's throat. arcade lifts alex into the air and slams her against a wall, pinning her there. he thrusts his face into hers.}
<C>__{arcade}
<D>__{you're too late, alex. you've always been too late. and now your time's up. you see, i needed someone to retrieve my heart for me. i couldn't do it myself. those are the rules. but now that i've got it, i will destroy it. and i will be free of my program, and i will be god. thank you, alex. thank you so much.}
<A>__{arcade slowly squeezes her throat and alex chokes, gasping for air that isn't forthcoming. tears well up in her eyes and her face turns red. she tries to pry the bony, black fingers from her throat, but she can't...}
<B>__{her p.o.v.}
<A>__{as she sees the faces of her friends. frozen. unable to help. then the images swirl and alex begins to lose consciousness.}
<C>__{arcade}
<D>__{you're not dying yet, alex. you haven't been to the final level. level ten.}
<A>__{arcade drops alex to the ground, then wraps a hand into her hair and drags her across the floor...}
<B>__{a doorway}
<A>__{stands in the darkness. arcade rips it open, revealing absolute emptiness beyond. it's like a doorway into space, a hole in the fabric of reality. it sucks the air into it, light...everything. it touches some sort of primal fear. gut instinct. you don't ever want to go to this place. ever.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{no! no!!!!!!!!!!!!!!}
<A>__{she twists madly, trying to pull away, but arcade is too strong. he shoves her through the doorway. her hands briefly latch onto the doorjamb. arcade violently kicks her and her hands slip away. they slip and she tumbles through. arcade slams the door shut.}
<C>__{arcade}
<D>__{goodbye, alex. it's been real.}
<A>__{these words appear on the screen, "final level the real world"}
