<B>__{full shot roof}
<A>__{about twenty of company gis men, including almost all the non cams, are on the roof, they are crouched behind the chimneys or down on their knees in the corners. the bars are propped on the low walls or chimney tops, their muzzles pointed to the sky.}
<B>__{long shot shooting from roof to sky}
<A>__{three jap planes, forming a v, are heading straight for camera.}
<B>__{full shot men on roof}
<C>__{dhom}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{come on, you dirty sons }
<A>__{the scream of the planes drowns dhom's voice. there is a tremendous clatter as the men fire. the jap planes pass, untouched. from this moment on there is no letup of the noise there is a wild cacophony of jap planes, bars, karelsen's machine gun, the deep sound of bombs hitting in the far distance. and chief choate, singing the regimental marching song, loudly and lustily.}
<C>__{another angle}
<A>__{as warden comes up on the roof through the skylight. he shouts incoherently at the men. they shout back in a wild cheer. they are like a pack of hungry men enjoying their first big meal in years. in b.g. the jap v has swung about and heads back. warden grabs a bar from the roof.}

<B>__{full shot roof}
<A>__{the men fire in unison. they rise after the planes pass, shake their fists. henderson and others of the loading detail appear on the roof, bringing up more ammunition.}
<B>__{close shot featuring warden}
<A>__{he lets out a hoarse yell of glee and pride. "these are my boys. this is my company," it seems to say. the men answer back with a great answering shout.}
<C>__{another angle}
<A>__{warden makes a tour of the roof, laughing, exhorting, slapping the men on their buttocks like a quarterback. they respond with tremendous spirit; they are having one hell of a time. we get only a snatch of what warden is yelling.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{ don't worry about wasting ammo! throw your empty clips down into the yard. the loading detail will pick 'em up }
<A>__{the sound of a bugle blowing insistently is now heard, blending into the rest of the noise. treadwell runs to the edge of the roof, looks over.}
<B>__{long shot shooting from roof to quadrangle}
<A>__{at the bugler's post, friday clark is sounding a call.}
<B>__{medium shot on roof}
