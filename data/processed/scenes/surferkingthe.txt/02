<L>__{ext early morning thunder bay}
<A>__{big mike, the park's owner manager a 50 something man who is portly and bald, and richard thompson, head lifeguard and another guard are on the east side of thunder bay. there is a post with a box on top of it that has a winter cover on it. the guard is standing there with a garden hose holding it so the water goes into thunder bay. he is obviously tired, and has been standing there a long time. we look back at the massive size of the pool and get the joke. big mike and richard pull off the winter cover. the guard turns to look and the hose turns with him, getting big mike wet. they object and he turns back to filling thunder bay. richard moves the guard to a safe distance. big mike blows the dust off of the box at the top of the post, and we see it is a large push button. big mike looks at richard who nods "go ahead" and then pushes the button. they both draw back as if something big should happen, but nothing. they look at each other and big mike motions for richard to go over to the wall housing the wave tank for the pool. richard waves ok, and big mike pushes the button again. when nothing happens, richard whacks the side of the tank with his closed fist. suddenly a huge wave rolls out. nodding his approval, big mike checks off an item in his clipboard.}
