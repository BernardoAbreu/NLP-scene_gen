<A>__{slowly tracking down a long line of couples. some with kids, some old, some young, all waiting to pay their $55 and pick up their marriage license. we hold on a young couple, late 20's, keith fisher and his fiancee, liz garrety. fisher has a blondish quality to him, unassuming, pleasant, attentive, a bit more reactive than he could be. liz is quite attractive, but somewhat tense, and not at all happy about having to stand in this very slow moving line.}
