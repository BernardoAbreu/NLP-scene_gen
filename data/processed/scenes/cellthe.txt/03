<L>__{interior campbell center edward's room day}
<A>__{although this is a hospital room filled with medical equipment, its sterility has been camouflaged with toys, posters, photographs, and drawings to make it more "homey." (some hint at aspects of edward's fantasy world). every comfort has been provided and no expense spared. henry, miriam, and catherine, now wearing funky casual clothes under a lab coat, stand opposite cooperman. sitting on the bed with edward is ella baines, an elegantly dressed woman in her mid 40's. there is a soulfulness to her, but the husband, lucien baines, 60's, possesses the icy demeanor of a corporate tycoon. one might write him off as cold, but we sense a genuine love for his wife and child. ella smiles and caresses edward's hair.}

<D>__{i will tell the nurse.}

<D>__{god, he loves when you visit.}

<D>__{my husband wonders if that's true.}
<P>__{(delivering bad news)}
<D>__{he wants to place edward in a hospital.}
<A>__{seeing an unfunded future, henry's ready to disassociate himself from miriam and catherine...}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{there are other applications for the scanner, mr. baines...}

<D>__{you don't know about me, though, do you?}
<C>__{lucien}
<D>__{catherine, we've waited eighteen months for signs of progress...}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{there's been progress.}
<C>__{lucien}
<D>__{yes, but there is no proof the procedure works. all i have is a belief that your interaction with my son is not a hallucination.}
<A>__{catherine is hurt and vulnerable due to exhaustion and the intensity of her experience with edward, but feels she must defend herself.}
<C>__{catherine}
<P>__{(to cooperman, miriam, henry)}
<D>__{you picked me, remember? and i took the job. gladly. this is the next wave and i want to be part of it...}
<C>__{cooperman}
<D>__{no one is doubting your ability.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{then what is it?}
<A>__{introspective and solemn eyed, lucien takes a moment, then:}
<C>__{lucien}
<D>__{i've invested millions of dollars in this study... and i've convinced others to do the same. i suppose i should feel responsible to them, but i don't. i could care less if they see a profit. i'm responsible to my boy, that's all that matters.}
<P>__{(looks her in the eye)}
<D>__{you tell me... am i doing the right thing?}
