<D>__{eh! eh! eh! we're department of works! department of works up here! careful with those bloody things!}
<A>__{jill, charlie and bill are hustled aside by a security man who clears the fireman's pole from the hole. we can see the troops in the room below leaving. a second security man has untied a rope hanging out of the open window. he coils the rope up neatly and the two security men leave the flat.}

<P>__{(to jill as they watch this highly efficient operation)}
<D>__{don't take any notice, love, it's their training makes them like animals. best in the world, though.}

<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{don't you worry love, we'll have everything shipshape in a jiffy.}
<C>__{bill}

<C>__{jill}
<D>__{there must be some mistake ... mr buttle's harmless...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{we don't make mistakes.}
<A>__{so saying, he drops the manhole cover, which is faced with same material as the floor, over the hole in the floor. to his surprise it drops neatly through the floor into the flat below.}
