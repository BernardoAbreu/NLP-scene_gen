<L>__{interior hospital emergency area same time}
<A>__{dozens of patients lie on gurneys awaiting treatment in a holding area. it's still more intense at the entrance: voices talking back and forth urgently, police officers, civilians, doctors and nurses converging.}
<L>__{exterior hospital emergency area late afternoon}
<A>__{five ambulances unload patients at the same time. at that moment a group of twenty japanese hospital administrators reaches the e.r. portion of their tour. a white mercedes tears up the ramp and screeches to a stop. a young man in gang colors is pushed out, bleeding heavily. a doctor runs at the mercedes to head it off, yelling indignantly. the car plows right into him and takes off. another ambulance crests the ramp, lights flashing. the mercedes slams into it head on. nurses and doctors run into the parking lot. a gangbanger gets out of the mercedes, dazed and wobbly. he pulls a pistol. everyone dives for cover. the mercedes driver is unconscious. the driver of the smashed up ambulance is slumped over the wheel. the rear doors fly open, and a young hispanic woman, rosa herrera, leaps out.}

<D>__{somebody help us! please, somebody!}
<A>__{doctors and nurses work on patients and try to get to the injured doctor, but the kid with the gun keeps them away. security guards draw their guns and scream at him to drop it.}
<C>__{rosa }
<D>__{why isn't anybody helping us?!!}
<P>__{(to gunman in spanish)}
<D>__{hey, you little shit! if i had a gun i'd shoot you right now!}
<A>__{the loading area is jammed with panicked people. doctors and nurses creep out of the hospital on all fours, trying to stay low. no one is getting to rosa, whose frantic eyes find betty. they look right at each other.}
<C>__{rosa }
<D>__{what are you standing there for?!}
<A>__{betty walks toward her calmly, indifferent to the danger as rosa pulls the gurney out of the ambulance herself. a paramedic lies unconscious inside.}
<C>__{rosa }
<D>__{you gotta help him, he's hurt bad!!}
<A>__{on the gurney is a young man with a chest wound, nearly dead from blood loss. a doctor appears and quickly examines him while keeping one eye on the gunman. he looks up at betty.}
<D>__{doctor #1 forget it! he doesn't have a chance. help us over here.}
<A>__{the doctor takes off. rosa looks at betty, crying.}
<C>__{rosa}
<D>__{please!}
<A>__{betty hesitates, then checks his pulse he has none. she peels back the bandages over a huge chest wound.}
<C>__{rosa }
<D>__{danny, it's gonna be all right!}
<A>__{betty looks at rosa again; looks around for help there's no one. she plunges her fingers into the wound.}
<C>__{rosa }
<P>__{(panic)}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{he has no heartbeat!}
<C>__{rosa}
<D>__{you're hurting him!!}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i'm massaging his heart. i saw it done once.}
<C>__{rosa}
<D>__{are you crazy?!! stop it!!!}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{listen to me! if i don't do this, he's dead!}
<A>__{she keeps working on him. we hear a gunshot, and the kid with the pistol falls to the pavement. the loading area immediately fills with doctors, nurses and cops.}
<C>__{betty }
<D>__{all right, we're moving him inside! give me a hand!}
<A>__{rosa is shocked into motion. together they wheel danny toward the entrance. a doctor and two nurses come out to take over. betty, her white uniform now covered in blood, steps aside.}
