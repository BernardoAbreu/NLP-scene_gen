<D>__{mr. fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business.}
<P>__{(they stop)}
<D>__{the natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.}

<D>__{nothing. strangely enough , it all turns out well.}
