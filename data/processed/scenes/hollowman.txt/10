<L>__{interior elevator day}
<A>__{inside the elevator is a numberless keypad. sebastian taps in his floor code.}
<C>__{elevator }
<D>__{authorization please.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{caine zero zero two seven.}
<C>__{elevator }
<D>__{authorization verified. good morning, dr. caine.}
<A>__{the elevator descends with a groaning hum. it passes below us and keeps descending into the belly of the earth, the shaft goes down forever.}
<L>__{interior habitat s corridor}
<A>__{we slowly push down a hallway panelled by plexiglas chambers. each chamber looks as if it s tailored for a specific animal, although no animals are visible. as we pass one habitat, something slams into the plexiglas and begins barking. another howl joins in. then screeching. suddenly the hallway fills with a dozen animal cries. thump.}
<B>__{thump.}
<A>__{the plexiglas on several chambers vibrates as if angry animals were slamming against it. but still, no animals are seen. above each chamber, video screens display thermal images revealing heat signatures of the various animals, but they remain invisible to the naked eye. matt taps on a sheet of plexiglas which seals off another seemingly empty cage.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{isabelle ...}
<A>__{the woodchips on the floor shift and suddenly the plexiglas steams up right in front of matt s face. the plexiglas begins to shake violently.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{calm down baby. calm down. it s okay...}
<A>__{matt takes a pair of thermal goggles from his belt and pulls them down over his eyes. thermal pov a rather large heat signature, ape like in shape, rattles about the cage. matt slowly unlatches the plexiglas door and reaches inside.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{it s okay, baby. it s okay. i m not going to hurt you. come here.}
<A>__{thermal pov he reaches out to the creature. he grabs hold of it, firmly. stroking it. the creature coos. matt reaches for a hypo and brings it up to the creature.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{just hold still.}
<A>__{something clamps down on his hand, breaking his skin. blood erupts in a bite pattern.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{ow, shit.}
<A>__{matt drops the hypo and falls back. the cage door flies open and something runs out. matt pulls himself up to see the heat signature running down the hallway. he turns around to see another heat signature coming at him. matt pulls off his goggles to see linda coming up the corridor.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{she bit me.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{yeah. she s become a lot more aggressive in the last few days.}
<A>__{linda takes the goggles from matt.}
<C>__{linda }
<D>__{go take care of that bite. i ll get her.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{and give you a chance to pull ahead? never.}
<A>__{linda opens a lock box at the end of the hallway and pulls out a two tranquilizer guns. she hands one to matt.}
<B>__{around the corner}
<A>__{a slight distortion shimmers as something runs past us. we hear hoots and footsteps. looking down the shadowy corridor, we hear grunting and a haunting heavy breathing. the control door is closed though and something large and angry is throwing itself against it. we can t see anything. a few moments later, linda and matt round the corner, wearing goggles and leveling their pistols.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(ala porky)}
<D>__{shh. be vewy, vewy quiet. i m hunting simians. heheheheh.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{knock it off.}
<P>__{(soothing voice)}
<D>__{isabelle!}
<A>__{thermal pov dark hallway. movement. a red shimmering heat signature. it comes running at linda. howling. linda fires. a t dart flies. thwack... it stops in mid air. then falls. but it doesn t hit the floor. instead, it stops inches above the ground. thermal pov the heat signature lies in a heap at linda s feet.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{good shootin , tex.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{what s that make it?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i m still ahead. 6 to 5.}
<A>__{like a smug gunfighter, linda blows imaginary smoke from the top of her tranquilizer gun.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{but i m catching up.}
