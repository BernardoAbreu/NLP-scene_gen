<L>__{interior living room, sheridan house day}
<A>__{emily, file in hand, trying to project professionalism in an arm chair that tilts to one side. margaret and lucy sitting opposite on the sofa.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{when do you expect your husband back?}
<A>__{margaret shrugs.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{because we've found it's more beneficial if the whole family participates.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{well he's not home so...}
<A>__{shrugs again.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{do you have any way of contacting him?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{not if i don't know where he is.}
<A>__{just then we hear a power tool go on in the basement. emily, sensing the lie, indicates the floor.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{is that...?}
<A>__{margaret averts her eyes.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{would you ask him to join us?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{he doesn't have anything to say.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{would you ask him?}
<A>__{margaret weighs emily's resolve, gives lucy a cautionary glance then exits. we hear her open a door and holler into the basement over the noise of the power tool.}
<C>__{margaret }
<D>__{edward! edward!}
<A>__{the power tool stops.}
<C>__{margaret }
<D>__{that lady's here. from the state. she wants to talk to you.}
<A>__{we hear an angry unintelligible reply.}
<C>__{margaret }
<D>__{i already told her, she wants to anyway.}
<A>__{we hear the power tool get thrown aside. footsteps pounding up the cellar stairs. emily's and lucy's faces reflect the same simple fear. their eyes meet.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{it'll be okay.}
<A>__{lucy not so sure. the footsteps are upon them. edward sheridan makes his entrance. a menacing man with a gaunt face and dark deep set eyes. emily holds out her hand.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{hi, i'm emily }
<A>__{edward forgoes the handshake, his contempt obvious. sits beside lucy on the sofa. margaret sits on the other side. lucy tenses, trapped between them. emily speaks with kindness and composure. hostile encounters part of the job.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{i'm here today because lucy's school is concerned about changes they're seeing in her academic performance. the kinds of changes they're seeing are often associated with family problems.}
<A>__{edward leans over and whispers something caustic in margaret's ear.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{eddie says we don't have family problems.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{that's just it, many times a family won't even know they're having problems until it's too late. that's where we come in. we help families communicate and learn healthier ways of resolving conflict.}
<A>__{edward whispers again in margaret's ear.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{eddie says we don't need your help.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{mr sheridan, is there some reason you won't speak to me directly?}
<A>__{edward just stares at her.}
<C>__{emily}
<P>__{(to margaret)}
<D>__{is there some reason why your husband won't speak to me directly?}
<A>__{margaret nods, gives edward a look as though for permission.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{eddie doesn't like speakin' out of anger.}
<A>__{emily does well to hide her fear. refusing to be intimidated, she engages edward's stare. a battle of wills. but his gaze has a murderous intensity she can't match. she looks down, shuffling papers. battle lost.}
