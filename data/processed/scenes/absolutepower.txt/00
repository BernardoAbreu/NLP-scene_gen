<A>__{the saddest eyes you ever saw. we are looking at an el greco drawing. it is a study for one of his paintings. pull back to reveal a bunch of art students are doing sketches of the eyes, the elongated fingers, the slender hands el greco drew so brilliantly. most of the students are around 20. a couple of suburban housewives are there too. and one older man. this is luther whitney. mid 60s, very fit, neatly dressed. at quick glance, he seems as if he might be a successful company executive. as we watch him draw we can tell he is capable of great concentration. and patient. with eyes that miss nothing: he has pilot's eyes. we'll find out more about him as time goes on, but this is all you really have to know: luther whitney is the hero of this piece. as we watch him draw luther's sketchbook. he is finishing his work on the eyes, and he's caught the sadness: it's good stuff. luther. it's not good enough for him. he looks at his work a moment, shakes his head.}
