<A>__{camera moves slowly towards the side exterior of 124, into a close up of a woman looking out of a second floor bedroom window. it is sethe, mother of the two boys and denver. she hums her melody, softly, sadly, with a resigned understanding of why her boys are running away...and a deep pain that is too constant to notice.}

<L>__{interior 124 baby suggs bedroom later that day.}
<A>__{baby suggs, grandmother and mother in law to sethe, sits in her bed fondling colored fabric of bright green..it is the only vibrant color in an otherwise drab surrounding. suggs is bed ridden, exhausted to her bones her face a mosaic of suffering and sacrifice and tested faith.}
<C>__{baby suggs}
<D>__{ya know what i'd love to see? i loved to see me some lavender. you got any lavender? or even pink pink'll do.}
<A>__{sethe is placing folded laundry into a dresser. she stops and checks her pockets for rags or swatches...she looks around the room..}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{no. sorry.}
<C>__{baby suggs}
<D>__{ah, winter in ohio is especially rough if you've got an appetite for color.}
<A>__{suggs goes back to contemplating her green until;}
<C>__{sethe }
<D>__{oh wait...}
<A>__{suggs looks up to see sethe sticking her pink tongue out at her. suggs smiles.}
<C>__{baby suggs}
<D>__{oh, that's fine. fine.}
<A>__{sethe lets out a small laugh. she walks toward the window, stretching her body. her expression changes as she thinks of her boys. baby suggs reads her like a book.}
<C>__{baby suggs}
<D>__{they'll be all right. i'm surprised they lasted here this long.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{i don't know. maybe we should have moved.}
<C>__{baby suggs}
<D>__{what'd be the point? not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead negro's grief. we lucky our ghost is a baby. my husband spirit come back? or yours? don't talk to me! ha..you lucky. you got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. be thankful. i had eight. eight with six fathers. every one of them gone from me. four taken, four chased and all, i expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. my first born alls i can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. her little hands..i wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. can you beat that? eight children and that's all i remember.}
<C>__{sethe}
<P>__{(returning to her work)}
<D>__{you remember halle.}
<C>__{baby suggs}
<D>__{oh, i remember bits and pieces of all of'em i guess..halle, of course..i had halle a lifetime. almost twenty years... my two girls, sold and gone before i could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. my third child, my son after halle...i let that straw boss have me for four months so's i could keep that boy. next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. i couldn't love that child. i wouldn't. not any of the rest either. god take what he would....and he did...}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{the boys wouldn't have left if halle were here.}
<C>__{baby suggs}
<D>__{those boys didn't even know him. you had six whole years of marriage to my halle fathered every one of your children. a blessing. i learned hard that a man's just a man, but a son like that...like halle..now that's somebody.}
<A>__{sethe's mixed feelings show all over her face. although she loved halle, there is clearly something unresolved in her.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{just got a few more things to do, then i will start supper.}
<A>__{sethe exits.}
