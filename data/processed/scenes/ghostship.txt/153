<A>__{greer stands at the galley sink finishing off the last of a jug of water as murphy and the others step in. he turns to see them.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{never been more thirsty in my life.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{drink up then.}
<A>__{greer smiles, raising the jug to drink as the others take a seat, looking on at him.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{how're you feeling?}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{lost my sea legs.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{any dizziness?}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{headache, nausea, lights?}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{lights?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{sudden flashes of light.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{i feel fine.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{what day is it?}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{i don't know. tuesday?}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{wrong. it's friday.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{try wednesday.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{right. wednesday.}
<A>__{a beat as they all hold there. greer takes a seat.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{you don't remember?}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{last thing i remember i was aboard the chimera. down somewhere in there scavenging around.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{you've been out for about a day.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{say what?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.}
<A>__{greer only holds there.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{oh, man.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{we heard you scream. any idea what you might've seen?}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{i wish i could tell you. i'd be real interested to know myself.}
<A>__{another beat as they hold there, as greer takes another drink of water.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{the ah... the radio's out.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{somebody took it out of commission last night.}
<A>__{a beat as they all hold there.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{smashed it up pretty bad.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{but, who ?}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{the skipper seems to think i did it. that i'm more interested in that gold than my own safety or the safety of my fellow shipmates.}
<A>__{a beat as they hold there, as murphy looks back.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{did you?}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{hell no. you think i'm crazy?}
<A>__{another beat as they hold there.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{regardless of how it happened, there isn't much of a chance to fix it. the odds of another vessel in range of the walkie talkies are almost astronomical. so, as of today, we're pretty much on our own out here.}
