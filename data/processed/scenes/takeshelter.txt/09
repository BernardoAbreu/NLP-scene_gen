<A>__{the lights are out and the house is quiet. curtis eases open the front door and steps inside. standing on the door mat, he slips off his mud caked boots and gently sets them aside. at hannah's bedroom door, curtis places his palm flat on the door and lets it open. hannah is curled up with the covers. he watches her sleep. samantha, barefoot and wearing a sleep shirt, walks up behind curtis. he turns his head when she approaches.}
