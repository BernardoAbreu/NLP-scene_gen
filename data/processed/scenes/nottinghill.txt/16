<L>__{interior kitchen day}
<A>__{william is tidying up frantically. then he hears anna's feet on the stairs. she walks down, wearing a short, sparkling black top beneath her leather jacket. with her trainers still on. he is dazzled by the sight of her.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{would you like a cup of tea before you go?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no thanks.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{coffee?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{orange juice probably not.}
<A>__{he moves to his very empty fridge and offers its only contents.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{something else cold coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{really, no.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{would you like something to nibble apricots, soaked in honey quite why, no one knows because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless there we go yours if you want them.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{do you always say 'no' to everything?}
<A>__{pause. she looks at him deep.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i better be going. thanks for your help.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{you're welcome and, may i also say... heavenly.}
<A>__{it has taken a lot to get this out loud. he is not a smooth talking man.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{take my one chance to say it. after you've read that terrible book, you're certainly not going to be coming back to the shop.}
<A>__{she smiles. she's cool.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{yes. well. my pleasure.}
<A>__{he guides her towards the door.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{nice to meet you. surreal but nice.}
<A>__{in a slightly awkward moment, he shows her out the door. he closes the door and shakes his head in wonder. then...}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{'surreal but nice.' what was i thinking?}
<A>__{... he shakes his head again in horror and wanders back along the corridor in silence. there's a knock on the door. he moves back, casually...}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{coming.}
<A>__{he opens the door. it's her.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{oh hi. forget something?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i forgot my bag.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{oh right.}
<A>__{he shoots into the kitchen and picks up the forgotten shopping bag. then returns and hands it to her.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{here we go.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{thanks. well...}
<A>__{they stand in that corridor in that small space. second time saying goodbye. a strange feeling of intimacy. she leans forward and she kisses him. total silence. a real sense of the strangeness of those lips, those famous lips on his. they part.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment. disaster...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{don't worry about it. i thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpointerior}
<A>__{suddenly there is a clicking of a key in the lock.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{oh my god. my flatmate. i'm sorry there's no excuse for him.}
<A>__{spike walks in.}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{spike walks past unsuspiciously and heads into the kitchen.}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{i'm just going to go into the kitchen to get some food and then i'm going to tell you a story that will make your balls shrink to the size of raisins.}
<A>__{and leaves them in the corridor.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{probably best not tell anyone about this.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{right. no one. i mean, i will tell myself sometimes but... don't worry i won't believe it.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{bye.}
<A>__{and she leaves, with just a touch of william's hand. spike comes out of the kitchen, eating something white out of a styrofoam container with a spoon.}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{there's something wrong with this yogurt.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{it's not yogurt it's mayonnaise.}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{well, there you go.}
<P>__{(takes another big spoonful)}
<D>__{on for a video fest tonight? i've got some absolute classic.}
