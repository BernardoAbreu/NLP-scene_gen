<C>__{grug}
<D>__{whoa! stay back. we don't know what it wants.}
<A>__{as grug moves around the circle, picking up sitting croods and placing them a safe distance from the fire, he talks to them like a kindergarten teacher:}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{now we'll all sit here, and wait for the sun to come back. and tomorrow we'll find a new cave, and pretend today never happened.}
<C>__{grug }

<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{ow! you're not my friend. stop, stop touching me!}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{thunk! uh, try hiding from it in the tall dry grass!}
<A>__{thunk sprints through the grass, arms flailing, as a ring of fire blazes up.}

<P>__{(pleading with fire)}
<D>__{stop please, please. i'm only nine.}
<A>__{gran cackles at her grandson's misfortune, but then she realizes her walking stick is on fire. angrily, gran starts to slam the burning end of the stick on the ground, trying to put it out. but she only ends up making more small fires.}

<D>__{ooh, more fire babies.}
<A>__{while gran tries desperately to save her cane, ugga starts throwing sticks on the small fires, which begin to grow in size.}
