<L>__{interior catacomb below "sphinx" day}
<A>__{a man wearing a lightweight thermal suit is running through this labyrinth of tunnels. the ground trembles under him, as if in an earthquake. we cannot clearly make out his face, especially since he wears some kind of breathing apparatus over a portion of it. the surface of the tunnel's "walls" is curious; the walls are, again, bright reddish orange, and a composite of two different substances: rough textured, clay like material and red quartz, which glistens like crystal. the man throws a backward glance over his shoulder, fear fully, as he runs. his hands are splattered with blood. because of this, the red glow, the air of fear to the man, and the ground heaving and buckling, there is almost a satanic suggestion to the scene. suddenly, up ahead of the man, there appears a brilliant white light. he sees it, and runs even faster towards it. we are almost up to the light, and we see hands reaching out of the light towards us... that seem to beckon him to}
