<A>__{the writing group meets. hannah, henry, john, william, alan and colette sit around the living room, pages in front of them. writers at work sign on display. maureen, trying not to be in the way, goes from writer to writer, carrying a large tray of veggies.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{alright. whose turn is it to read? henry?}
<A>__{all eyes on henry. he shifts uncomfortably in his chair.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{oh. um. someone else go. i don't have anything new ready tonight.}
<A>__{concerned looks all around.}
<C>__{colette}
<D>__{it's been weeks, henry.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i know. still can't focus.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{don't be a pussy, obert. get writing. complete the mission.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{writer's block can be very serious, john.}
<A>__{john scoffs in disbelief. maureen offers william some veggies. he helps himself and checks out maureen as she moves on to alan.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{what's so hard, bro'? i mean, you've got scott and christy. two friends. tell their story.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{that's the problem. i think the story's changing.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{changing? how so?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{lately i'm feeling something much deeper, much richer. scott and christy, um, growing closer.}
<A>__{the other group members appear puzzled.}
<C>__{colette}
<D>__{christy's a beautiful, wealthy author in beverly hills. how close can they get?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{follow me. something happens. christy has an epiphany. she she realizes her feelings run much deeper now for scott.}
<A>__{henry does everything he can not to look at hannah. short beat.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{nah. don't buy it.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{they're friends. why muck it up? don't put 'em in the same foxhole.}
<C>__{colette}
<D>__{is this scott wanting to go beyond the friendship? there's no way christy would suggest it. what do you think, hannah?}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{yes. hannah, what do you think?}
<A>__{all eyes go back to hannah. she does not want to answer.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{gee, i i guess...i really never thought of them that way.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{never?}
<A>__{hannah shakes her head. chooses her words carefully.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{no. it's always been a friendship.}
<A>__{henry takes a moment. thinking.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{you don't see anything possibly happening between them?}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{no. friends. nothing more.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{exactly.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{i'd be uncomfortable with any changes in the relationship.}
<A>__{message received. all eyes on henry. defeated.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{ok. thanks, everyone. i will try to have something on paper next time.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{remember, obert. complete the mission.}
