<L>__{exterior camp site late afternoon}
<A>__{full shot. long shadows of the hills lie on the grassy meadow along the stream that is bordered by cottonwoods and willows. a knoll overlooks the camp site. the caravan can be seen as it halts in the lush grass a few yards from the stream. the girls sit lifelessly on the wagon; they seem too tired to dismount. then, finally, marcia helps elaine to climb stiffly down. with the exception of mary they all let themselves down in the grass. mary walks to the head of the team and starts fumbling with the harness. steve comes into the scene, dismounts quickly and pulls the saddle off his horse. the remuda has fanned out, the horses moving toward the water. steve crosses to mary and takes over the job of unbuckling the harness. mary smiles gratefully and rubs her hand across her face.}
<C>__{clay's voice}
<D>__{steve, see the horses don't drink too much }
<A>__{steve straightens, looks towards the horses and moves off. he speaks to mary over his shoulder.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{leave that unharnessing for me, ma'am.}
<A>__{mary smiles after him, then moves across the grass, camera dollying ahead of her. she sinks to her knees in the patch of sand by the stream and leans down and puts her face under the water. then, sitting up, she wipes the water and dust from her face with a handkerchief. clay rides up from behind, dismounts, scoops up some water from the river in the brim of his hat and drinks it. for a second he watches mary.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{there's a place down a ways, where you and the girls can wash some of that dust off.}
<A>__{mary's manner is business like. she and the girls are along for the ride. she wants no favors wants to do her part.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{thanks. and isn't there something we can do about supper or making the beds?}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(half smile)}
<D>__{steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(curt)}
<D>__{but you eat, don't you?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{where do you keep the can opener?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{in the grub box.}
<P>__{(softening)}
<D>__{toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.}
<A>__{he turns and leads his horse back to the wagon, stands there unsaddling it. mary rises.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{marcia all of you. come on.}
<A>__{she starts downstream.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{angled past wagon. clay tosses the saddle into the wagon bed, slaps his mare on the rump. she trots off. climbing up on the wheel, he gets the grub box under the seat and lifts it down. steve comes from out of scene and starts unharnessing the team.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(trying to be casual)}
<D>__{where'd they go?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{swimming.}
<A>__{clay comes past him, carrying the grub box. he puts it down near where some stones make a crude firebox.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{it's sort of nice having company along. not so lonesome.}
<A>__{clay squats by the stones and starts building a fire.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{when you get the team watered, rustle up some wood.}
<A>__{he fans the small flame with his hat. steve leads the mules down toward the stream.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{angled past clay. in the b.g. steve stands by the stream, letting the team drink. o.s. the women can be heard laughing and splashing. steve gives all his attention to what is going on downstream. clay puts wood on the fire, opens the grub box. he sees steve, takes the coffee pot out of the box and heads for the stream.}
<B>__{med. long shot}
<A>__{angled past steve downstream. behind the willows the girls are bathing. however they are too far away to be seen clearly and the willows make a fairly effective screen. clay walks upstream and fills the coffee pot, then comes back to stand for a moment beside steve. steve, who hadn't seen clay until now, suddenly gets very busy giving all his attention to the mules.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(to mules)}
<D>__{you boys have had enough.}
<A>__{he jerks them from the water and leads them away. clay frowns after him, then goes back to the wagon.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{on wagon and fire. as clay passes the wagon, he reaches into the bed and gets a couple of strips of scrap iron. these he carries to the fire. he puts the iron strips across the blaze, sets the coffee pot on, feeds the fire with some more wood, then going back to the wagon, he takes his rifle out, throws a shell into the chamber and starts off up the knoll.}
