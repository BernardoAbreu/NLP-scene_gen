<A>__{the door swings open, and mother superior and christy enter. the room is tiny, with bare plaster walls. there is a narrow wooden bed, with a thin muslin covered mattress. there is a small nightstand and a wooden stool.}

<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{you were right the first time. is this like, solitary? the cooler? where's the furniture?}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{our lives are simple. we have little need for material possessions.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{right, sure thing. but what about, like, appliances? like a little color portable? boom box?}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{useless distractions.}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(sinking to the bed)}
<D>__{it's like the stone age. the room time forgot. what about a phone?}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{and whom would you call?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{oh, i don't know... satan?}
<C>__{mother superior}
<P>__{(not amused)}
<D>__{your cell is more than adequate.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{right. so what do we do now? ping pong? row over to the monastery?}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{it is nine p.m. pleasant dreams.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{wait. no. you're kidding. lights out? at nine? my day's just starting.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{i'm sure. if i were you, i would use this time, to think about my life. and its direction. or lack thereof.}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(indignant)}
<D>__{what's wrong with my life?}
<C>__{mother superior}
<D>__{from all i've heard, just about everything. your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead.}

<C>__{mother superior }
<D>__{if you're fooling anyone, it's only yourself. god has brought you here. take the hinterior}
<A>__{mother superior leaves. after the door shuts, christy stands and looks out the one small window in her cell. she leans her head against the wall. she is trying not to think about what mother superior has said. still, the mess her life has become overwhelms her. she fights back tears.}
