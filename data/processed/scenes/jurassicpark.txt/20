<C>__{regis}
<D>__{no! i told the rain god to hold it off till we got back.}

<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{gennaro, for once in your life, let something really move you.}

<D>__{ever get the feeling we're just hammond's damn guinea pigs?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{i like to wait and see.}
<A>__{ellie motions ahead, with excitement and apprehension, to a huge gate. regis and the kids wave behind to grant, ellie and gennaro. the gate's doo rs swing open and the cruisers move forward. the kids squeal out a ya hoo that floats through the air to grant. but grant wears a cautious face, his skeptical eyes scan the landscape. a fanfare of trumpets and then a pre recorded voice speaks from a console in each cruiser. video screens display a welcome message.}
<D>__{pre recorded voice welcome to jurassic park. you are now entering the lost world of the prehistoric past, a world of mighty creatures long gone from the face of the earth, which you are privileged to see for the first time ...}
