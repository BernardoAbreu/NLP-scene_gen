<C>__{mater}
<D>__{hey, wait for me!}
<A>__{tomber, skidding away, kicks a tent in finn's way. holley quickly pivots right and disappears. where did she go? finn, hot in pursuit, leaps another obstacle and loses ground to tomber who turns a corner and finds himself grill to grill with holley. he whips to the left but turns over, rolling sideways and crashing to a stop. holley zaps him with electroshockers. finn suddenly arrives, stops her.}
