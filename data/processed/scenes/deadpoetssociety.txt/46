<L>__{exterior campus entrance day}
<A>__{knox is riding his bike around in circles near the entrance. seeing no one nearby, he races through the open gates and down the road. he comes to the top of a hill and then goes downhill across the grass, shouting as he sends an immense flock of geese flying into the air.}
<L>__{exterior parking lot day}
<A>__{a number of vehicles drive up, filled with students dressed in bright red cosyumes, playing trumpets and various other instruments as they pass. knox watches the growing crowd of students. they are all converging on a bus. a football player, wearing a horned helmet, dances on the roof of the bus. a band is playing while a group of cheerleaders are practising. knox spots chris amongst the cheerleaders. he watches her until chet comes along and she grabs hold of his hand. knox looks away in disgust.}

<D>__{okay, everybody on the bus. let's go, boys. come on, let's go. on the bus, boys. now!}
<A>__{chris jumps into chet's arms as everyone begins to board the buses. knox turns his bike around and leaves.}
