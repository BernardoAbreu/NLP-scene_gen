<D>__{if chris were trying to disappear, it would have been a pretty uncharacteristic lapse for him to give the police his real place of residence. though my parents had already contacted the annandale police with their initial concerns, this ticket arriving from california made them frantic. carine (v.o.) (cont'd) my father called one of his old government friends who put him in touch with a private investigator, someone who'd done work with the dia and the cia. using the willow creek ticket as a starting point, the investigator began chasing down leads. most of them led far afield to europe and south africa. ultimately turning up nothing. what my dad couldn't believe was that he'd given up his car. he seemed to love that datsun so much. it sounded just like chris to me, though. he was very much of the school that you should own nothing except what you could carry on your back at a dead run.}
