<L>__{exterior forest day}
<A>__{a different forest. a wilderness of giant pines, ranging through the mountains for hundred of miles. it is late in the year. there is one human sound in the cold still ness, a voice singing. bobby, the owner of the voice, has a pack on his back. he is making his way up a steep slope to an area of flat ground. he stops singing, looks around, and calls out in a powerful voice.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{they've gone... long gone!}
<A>__{bobby looks around the abandoned camp, the dead fires, cleared areas for tents. up the slope and into view comes his companion, leading a laden pack horse. it is hector.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{how long?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{they've been gone a week, at least.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{damn them...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{we're ten days late...}
<A>__{they look at each other. they are in trouble, and now they know it.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{cheer up. have a look around. i will start on a fire...}
