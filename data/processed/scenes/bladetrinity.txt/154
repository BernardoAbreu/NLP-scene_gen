<L>__{interior heating duct night}
<A>__{zoe waits. it's cramped and claustrophobic inside the duct. she's managed to force herself all the way back to the ninety degree turn by curling up into a near fetal position. zoe's pov (through grate) mostly tile floor and a small portion of the open doorway leading to the hallway outside. she listens, trying to hear past the sound of her own breathing which has been magnified because of the ducting. the screams from the outer rooms have stopped. then zoe's pov (through grate) a pair of boots appear in the doorway drake. zoe holds her breath. we hear drake searching the bathroom, opening the lockers and bathroom stalls.}
<C>__{zoe's pov }
<D>__{drake's boot clad feet pass by the grate again, closer, tn s time. they pause for an interminable moment }
<A>__{zoe shuts her eyes. she can't stand it. finally, we hear drake's footsteps receding away. relieved, zoe takes in a breath and opens her eyes zoe's pov (through grate) drake's face is right there. pressed up against the other side of the grate, staring at her! zoe screams. with a roar, drake rips the grate off. he tries to climb inside, but the width of the duct is too narrow to accommodate the size of his upper body. instead, he reaches his right arm in, extending his clawed hand as far as he possibly can. zoe whimpers, trying to compress her mass into an even tighter ball on drake's hand, having reached the limits of its extension his fingertips only a few scant inches from zoe's face. zoe's been allowed a moment's reprieve. he can't reach her! but then we hear the sound of popping cartilage. of tiny bones shifting beneath drake's flesh. drake's fingers are elongating, snake like reaching for zoe's face, rapidly closing the space whici1 separates them }
