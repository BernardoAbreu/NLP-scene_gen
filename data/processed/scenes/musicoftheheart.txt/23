<L>__{interior music room day}
<A>__{roberta rosins her bow, standing in front of ten kids third through fifth grade who sit on the floor next to their violin cases. the kids are black and latino, with a couple of white faces. they're all talking and ignoring roberta except for naeem and guadalupe, a petite mexican girl with a long dark braid. [note: we'll see other violin students from time to time, but this is the class we'll follow for roberta's first year]}
