<L>__{interior clara's apartment morning}
<A>__{jack opens his eyes. sits up. he's shocked to have slept so deeply. clara must be in the shower. he looks around at the little room casually, like a curious lover. opens the top drawer of the bedside cabinet. finds a vibrator. opens the bottom drawer. finds a red purse. inside the red purse... finds a beretta double action model 21a bobcat. just at that moment clara comes out of the bathroom. jack shuts the drawer and pretends to be asleep.}
