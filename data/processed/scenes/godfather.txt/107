<L>__{int nite: luna azura (winter 1945)}
<A>__{a very small family restaurant with a mosaic tile floor. sollozzo, michael and mccluskey sit around a rather small round table near the center of the room. there are empty booths along the side walls; with a handful of customers, and one or two waiters. it is very quiet.}
<C>__{mccluskey}
<D>__{is the italian food good here?}
<C>__{sollozzo}
<D>__{try the veal; it's the finest in new york.}
<A>__{the solitary waiter brings a bottle of wine to the table. they watch him silently as he uncorks it and pours three glasses. then, when he leaves, sollozzo turns to mccluskey:}
<C>__{sollozzo}
<D>__{i am going to talk italian to mike.}
<C>__{mccluskey}
<D>__{sure, you two go right ahead; i will concentrate on my veal and my spaghetti.}
<A>__{sollozzo now begins in rapid sicilian. michael listening carefully and nodding every so often. then michael answers in sicilian, and sollozzo goes on. the waiter occasionally brings food; and they hesitate while he is there; then go on. then michael, having difficulty expressing himself in italian, accidentally lapses into english.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(using english for emphasis)}
<D>__{most important...i want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life.}
<C>__{sollozzo}
<D>__{what guarantees can i give you? i am the hunted one. i've missed my chance. you think too highly of me, my friend...i am not so clever...all i want if a truce...}
<A>__{michael looks long and hard at sollozzo, who is smiling holding his open hands up as if to say: "i have no tricks up my sleeve". then he looks away and makes a distressed look on his face.}
<C>__{sollozzo}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{is it all right if i go to the bathroom?}
<A>__{sollozzo is intuitively suspicious. he studies michael with his dark eyes. then he thrusts his hand onto michael's thigh feeling in and around, searching for a weapon.}
<C>__{mccluskey}
<D>__{i frisked him; i've frisked thousands of young punks; he's clean.}
<A>__{he looks at a man sitting at a table opposite them; indicating the bathroom with his eyes. the man nods, indicating no one is there.}
<C>__{sollozzo}
<D>__{don't take too long.}
<A>__{michael gets up and calmly walks to the bathroom, and disappears inside.}
