<A>__{a biohazard warning label is legible as the barrel slips beneath the surface. glowing toxic waste seeps from a gash in its side. spreading through the pool like neon ink.}
<L>__{exterior drainage ditch day}
<A>__{the ditch is littered with garbage. the drone of insects. no visible traces of toxic waste. a butterfly net sweeps through the air to capture an oversized horsefly. joshua taft (70s), scrutinizes the bug. this old codger is more comfortable studying bugs than socializing with people.}

<D>__{hey, mike. check this one out.}
<A>__{mike palmer (12) steps over for a look. puberty hit hard and fast for this bright, little nerd.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{he's huge!}
<C>__{joshua}
<D>__{they've been like this all week. must be something extra tasty in the water.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{joshua}
<D>__{dead coyote. snake maybe. back in the 'nam we'd eat python with a dash of habanero sauce. mighty satisfying.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{you ate snake?}
<C>__{joshua}
<D>__{when you're thirty klicks out from the nearest firebase. humpin' through the wake up with your finger on the trigger. charlie doesn't give you time to stop for cutlet.}
<A>__{as mike skims his own net over the water, he glimpses a familiar barrel at the bottom of the pool. the brightly colored biohazard warning label is clearly visible.}
