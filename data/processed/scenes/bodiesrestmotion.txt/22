<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{close up: coffee maker the coffee maker clock hits nine o'clock. the coffee maker clicks on with a rattle. steam starts to spew out. the coffee maker makes horrible gurgling sounds.}
<L>__{interior kitchen continuous}
<A>__{the kitchen is small and a little grimy, its furnishings fatigued. nick stares at the coffee maker in disbelief. he's dressed in a dress shirt, untied necktie, and slacks. he's carrying a sportscoat with a sears' employee name tag attached.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{beth!... beth!!}
<A>__{beth walks into the kitchen, wearing a robe and carrying the paper. nick points accusingly at the coffee maker as water pours down from around its top.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{it's... it's raining!}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{it does that.}
<A>__{she drops the paper on the kitchen table and gets a mug off the counter.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{since we got it?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(pouring herself a cup)}
<D>__{lately.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(throwing his jacket on a chair)}
<D>__{shit.}
<P>__{(agitated)}
<D>__{what's wrong with it?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{water comes out.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{shit.}
<P>__{(unplugging the coffee maker)}
<D>__{i hate this shit! it never kept the coffee hot. and now this.}
<A>__{he angrily wraps the cord around the coffee maker.}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(blowing on her coffee)}
<D>__{it still works.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(adamant)}
<D>__{no. it doesn't. water comes out.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{she sips her coffee. she flips open a box of dunkin' donuts.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i could've gotten a new one. on my discount. now it's too late.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{do you want a donut?}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{no. i want an appliance that works.}
<A>__{beth shrugs and takes a donut out of the box. she leans against the counter, eating the donut. nick walks past beth and jams the coffee maker into the trash.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{this coffee maker was junk.}
<A>__{nick pushes a button on the blender. it makes a horrible grinding whine. he unplugs it.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{this blender's junk. our t.v. is junk!}
<A>__{he jams the blender into the trash.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i don't know why we're even bothering to pack.}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(through a mouthful of donut)}
<D>__{you got me.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{the t.v. gets no channels.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{and it's fifteen inch.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{i can't believe we don't have a big t.v.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{we don't watch much.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{but at our age...}
<A>__{they stare at each other. nick picks the almost full pint bottle of scotch off the counter and puts it in his jacket pocket. beth takes another donut.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{why don't you take one?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i'm not hungry.}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(offhandedly)}
<D>__{not a donut. a t.v.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{take a t.v.?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{it's your last day.}
