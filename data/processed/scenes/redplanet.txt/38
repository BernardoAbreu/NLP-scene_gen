<B>__{end flashback}
<L>__{exterior mars surface day}
<A>__{the mev is horrendously battered. it's a wonder they're alive. chantilas is propped against a rock, moving a device the size of a hardback book across his abdomen. it's a kind of combination x ray sonogram. doesn't like what he sees. puts it aside for the moment without discussing it with the others. gallagher emerges from the mev dragging some tools and other salvaged gear. (note all communication is via the vox radios in their spacesuits.)}
<C>__{chantilas}
<D>__{what've we got?}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{the radio's dead. rover's dead. amee's dead. you gave me a shop and three months and i could get this thing set for orbital re entry. otherwise...it's staying here.}
<A>__{santen's climbed to the top of a nearby outcropping of rock. surveys the area}
<D>__{red sky, blue clouds, rocks.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{anything?}
<C>__{santen}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{pettengill}
<D>__{great. we put up with your shit for three hundred million miles, so you could crash land us on mars. just fucking great.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{by all rights, son, we should be dead. that was a decent piece of flying.}
<C>__{santen}
<D>__{we have a mission to accomplish, people...}
<C>__{pettengill}
<D>__{we'll be dead in eight hours anyhow when the air runs out. 'cause megapilot missed the landing site. there is no more fucking mission.}
<A>__{that puts it all into perspective.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{so, where the hell are we?}
<C>__{santen}
<D>__{the g.p.s. was tied to the radios...which are dead. transponder on the hab was tied to the nav computer...}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{...which is dead. didn't the boys at nasa pack us a compass?}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{there's no magnetic core on mars. wouldn't do any good.}
<A>__{gallagher considers all this for a moment.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{i don't think i like this planet.}
<C>__{chantilas}
<D>__{best guess. where do you think we are?}
<A>__{santen shrugs. as much as you can shrug in a spacesuit.}
<C>__{santen}
<D>__{somewhere downrange.}
<A>__{santen pulls his hhc out of a pocket on his thigh. 2050 descendant of a laptop. mutters at it. it whizzes past all hab info}
<D>__{schematics, the standard 360 degree pan from the landing site, topo map of mars. zooms in to show where the hab was deployed.}
<C>__{santen}
<D>__{based on the last uncorrupted nav state, and given that we were in a full manual descent with no computer correction, i'd say...in this 60x120 mile ellipse.}
<A>__{okay. that's big. there's a long moment of resignation. it's a little irrational, but then, re the hhc }
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{we've got every other mission variable in here, we ought to be able to figure aerobrake friction and the speed and orbit of the ares when we exited. we should be able to close in on the downrange variables. tighten up the ellipse. it's about the math.}
<A>__{gallagher can't believe it.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{this is it. this is that moment they told us about in high school. where one day again we'd use algebra. and it would save our lives. and i thought they were fucking kidding.}
<A>__{gallagher turns in frustration and walks away. chantilas calls to him }
<C>__{chantilas}
<D>__{stay in range. a thousand yards. and your radio's line of sight.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{right, i wouldn't want to get lost.}
<A>__{he continues to wander off. we can hear them discussing drag coefficients and whatnot. it just makes him ill. gallagher stares out at the martian plain. it would be kinda cool. except for the fact he's gonna die here. he's pissed and frightened. yanks his hhc out. mutters, images appear. all the hab details. stares at the map and then the 360 degree panorama. back at the map. back at the panorama. something about it strikes him. looks at it some more. he gets up, looks around. looks around some more. heads back to the guys...}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{i don't think it's about math. i don't like math, so i'm biased. i think it's about the picture.}
<A>__{he holds out the picture of the panorama. santen dismisses him he's not a scientist, he's not a pilot, he should leave them alone.}
<C>__{santen}
<D>__{we're not in that picture. if we were, we'd know where the hab was. we're trying to figure this out.}
<A>__{robby ignores him, tosses a rock in the sand, wraps the the 360 degree panorama around it. screen bends and turns translucent as he does.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<P>__{look, say that's the lander. at about 30 degrees in the distance, it sees this mountain with the funny top. and at about 180 degrees it sees this funny set of twin peaks. (points)}
<D>__{now i see this mountain over there. and these peaks over there behind me almost on a straight line. and then there's this other peak maybe, which would put us on the line, say here. which leaves the angle to the hab at about there...}
<A>__{santen and chantilas start to manipulate their hhcs faster than you can follow. muttering to them, hand gesturing, cross referencing back and forth to the map, as the ellipse shrinks and their landing location is...determined.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{space janitor first class gallagher, nicely done.}
<C>__{santen}
<D>__{the good news is it's an eight hour walk.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{there's bad news?}
<A>__{chantilas checks gallagher's wrist monitor.}
<C>__{chantilas}
<D>__{you've got seven and a half hours of air. try not to breathe too deep.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{let's get the hell outta here.}
<A>__{chantilas struggles to his feet. as the five of them tromp away in the giant landscape... flashback exterior space day the earth fills the screen. and then pulling back, back, back, back...it recedes in the distance and disappears. we catch up with the ares as the final launch stage fizzles out and is discarded. superimpose: mission time: day 1}
