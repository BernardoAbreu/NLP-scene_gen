<D>__{you thought i wouldn't notice the paperwork? i'm not the regional manager because i ignore the details.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i'm sorry, but it's absurd that if you need a small amount of money you have to go to a loan shark. only rich people can pay back loans over ten grand. a bank's job is not to just help the rich. it's to help anyone with a dream achieve it.}
