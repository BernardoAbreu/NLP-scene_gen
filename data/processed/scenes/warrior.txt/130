<A>__{thousands of people staring at the drive in screen and you can hear a pin drop. they're aghast. zito can hardly look. kc buries her head in nash's chest. on movie screen: the slaughter continues. how brendan is taking it is anyone's guess.}
<L>__{interior boardwalk hall arena same}
<A>__{koba gets brendan in a bear hug, lifts him off the ground, carries him into the center of the ring like a sack of laundry, and body slams him on his back.}
<C>__{callen }
<D>__{koba's got him in the air. oh no!}
<A>__{as frank screams for brendan to remain calm, a mortified tess watches. mercifully, the horn sounds, and brendan survives the round. he barely makes it back to his corner.}
<C>__{sheridan }
<D>__{frank campana has to think seriously about stopping this.}
<C>__{callen }
<D>__{seriously, sam. how much abuse can one man take?}
<A>__{the minutes passes in no time. it's time to go again.}
<C>__{josh rosenthal}
<D>__{let's go to war!}
<A>__{koba comes right after brendan, and it's soon more of the same. power slams. brutal strikes. brendan's face is carved up and battered. he tries to go for a take down, but koba snuffs it, then lifts brendan off the mat again and carries him through the air. frank screams, but there's nothing he can do. brendan is brutally slammed into the ground.}
<C>__{sheridan }
<D>__{uh oh, brendan's going for ride!}
<C>__{callen }
<D>__{that one shook the entire building!}
<A>__{as brendan writhes on the ground, koba grabs him and slings him against the fence like it's nothing. brendan flies through the air and rattles against the cage. then koba climbs on top of him and starts whaling away. tess can't even watch it. once again, just as rosenthal is about to stop the fight, the horn sounds.}
<C>__{sheridan }
<D>__{everyone has gotta be concerned about brendan conlon's bravery getting him into trouble here.}
<C>__{callen }
<D>__{his bravery can get him killed, sam. he's got nothing more to prove. he's already lasted two rounds against koba, which is more than anyone else can say. you wonder what's keeping this guy up.}
<A>__{brendan drags himself off the ground and limps to his stool. frank enters the cage. his usual positive attitude is gone. he comes at brendan with aggression instead.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{sit down. breathe.}
<P>__{(grabbing brendan's face)}
<D>__{look at me! look at me! why are we here, brendan? why are we here? are we here to win this fight? you tell me, `cause if we're not, i will throw in the towel right now. we'll get tess and we will go home. you don't knock him out, you lose the fight. understand me? you don't knock him out, you don't have a home.}
<A>__{josh rosenthal claps his hands. frank takes his cue to leave, but not before giving brendan one last look. it's now or never. brendan looks across the cage at koba. steels himself.}
<C>__{josh rosenthal}
<D>__{let's go to war!}
<A>__{brendan comes out and meets koba in the center of the cage, but the russian resumes his supremacy.}
<C>__{callen }
<D>__{conlon somehow answering the bell for round three, but koba's all over him again.}
<A>__{koba roughs the battered brendan up some more, but then brendan starts responding. throws a couple effective leg kicks. a decent punch or two.}
<C>__{sheridan }
<D>__{brendan's giving back, bryan. there are signs of life in brendan conlon. he's starting to mix it up!}
