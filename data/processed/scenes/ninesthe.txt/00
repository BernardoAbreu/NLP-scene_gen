<A>__{it'll make more sense in contexterior promise. a man's hand unwinds a short length of green string. we're extremely close, with a shallow, blurry focus. it's like the first moments after a dream just fragments. scissors cut the string. the man wraps it around his left wrist. a loop. a bracelet. we see the man's teeth, the edge of his chin as he pulls the knot tight. his fingers pull against the string. solid. it won't break easily.}
