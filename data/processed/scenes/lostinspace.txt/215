<D>__{it's almost time. i really am a word smith.}
<C>__{older will}
<D>__{once the core cylinder is fully injected, the planet will begin to come apart and the time doorway will stabilize. then i jump in.}

<D>__{tell me again, old monster, how did the girls die?}
<C>__{spider smith}
<D>__{we've been over this before, son. the spiders attacked the ship}
<C>__{older will}
<D>__{in all the years since, the spiders have never re surfaced. why?}

<C>__{spider smith}
<D>__{an entire planet on which to feed.}
