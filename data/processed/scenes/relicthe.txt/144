<L>__{interior hall of the asian peoples night}
<A>__{mbwun now drags himself across the grey carpet, headed for the stairs. in the darkness of the hall of asian peoples, pendergast is waiting. he lifts one of the s.w.a.t. team rifles which he holds in his hands. he aims, is about to fire, but then margo comes up behind him.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{no! don't kill him! pendergast, you were right. it's john!}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{that thing is john whittlesley. i should have seen it before! the fibers are infected with a virus. you eat them, and the virus alters your dna! he became addicted to them in south america, followed the plants back to the states. he probably entered the country as a man. it would have taken several months for the change to take place. that's how he got from the boat to the museum!}
<A>__{pendergast looks over and sees the monster. his eyes show disbelief. mbwun looks back at both of them briefly, then it disappears up the stairs.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{i don't believe it.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{you have to! listen! all viruses pass on their own dna. instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses! this one was different. it inserted a whole array of genes into john. reptile genes, sixty five million years old. those genes remade him! it's not his fault!}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{whatever that thing is, we have to kill it!}
<A>__{margo tries to stop him, but he shrugs her off.}
