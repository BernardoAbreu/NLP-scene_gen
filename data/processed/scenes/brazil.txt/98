<L>__{interior room 500l day}
<A>__{inside there is a connecting door to he next door room but the only person in the immediate room is a pleasant looking female typist, wearing headphones, chewing gum and typing with great facility. sam approaches the typist who, busily typing, twinkles a greeting (mimed) and silently mouths the words ...}
<C>__{typist}
<D>__{it won't be long now.}
<P>__{(she carries on typing)}
<A>__{sam nods, and stands quietly by her. he can hear tiny sounds coming through her headphones. he looks down at the piece of paper in the typewriter. he reacts a bit strangely, perhaps even winces. we see he close up of the words being struck crisply on paper.}
<C>__{on typewriter}
<D>__{ahhhh, oh god ... no, don't ... uhh, please ... i ... stop!! i can't stand ... aiieeee.}
<C>__{typist}
<P>__{(quietly, still typing)}
<D>__{can i help you?}
<A>__{she is looking at sam helpfully, holding one of the earphones away from her ear. from this earphone we can just hear quietly ...}
<C>__{earphone}
<D>__{oooooooh ... aaaaaahhh ... please ... arrrrrghhhh no ... please ... oh god, no ... no, stop, i don't know ...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm looking for officer 412 l.}
<A>__{the typist nods smiling. she puts back the earphone and carries on typing.}
<C>__{typist}
<D>__{i'm sure he won't be long now.}
<A>__{she types a little more but suddenly stops.}
<D>__{i thought so!}
<A>__{she takes off the earphones and takes the paper and carbonums out of her typewriter and starts collating all the different copies. through the frosted glass door leading into the next area, sam can see a figure come through a double door and turn left, making a silly 'hi' sign to the typist as he exits from sight. she is charmed. almost immediately after them, a white coated technician exits, but to the left.}
<C>__{typist}
<D>__{you can go in now.}
