<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior bedroom later that night}
<A>__{half a dozen candles illuminate the room. cynthia and victor are making love. not violent, but slow, passionate, dreamlike. they are completely enjoying each other. the satisfaction seems spiritual. they stare into each other's eyes the entire time. they are lost. gradually victor's rhythm builds. as his momentum increases, as the ecstasy nears, cynthia accelerates too. heaving, gasping, they are approaching a beautiful climax. but just when it seems victor is on the verge, the very threshold, he stops and jumps violently out of bed.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{oh jesus!}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{victor?}
<A>__{victor paces around the room, practically bouncing off the walls.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{oh, my god. i can't believe it. what a great idea...! too amazing! too amazing!}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{is something wrong?}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{not wrong, cynthia...right! the most right thing in the world!}
<A>__{he goes to his closet and pulls out a shoe box. he holds it with a coy expression, like a kid hiding a frog. cynthia's annoyance with the break in mood fades in light of his exuberance. their tone with each other remains loving, kidding.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{are you going to tell me your little secret, or should i just got dressed?}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{i'm sorry, cyn, but i just got the most incredible idea. it's absolutely beautiful! do you want to know what it is?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{yes!}
<A>__{he sits on the bad.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{i was just thinking about what we were doing here together...}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i should hope so...}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{wouldn't it be incredible if, right at the perfect moment right when we're coming, if we did it?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{did what?}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{what we were meant to do, of course.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<P>__{(puzzled)}
<D>__{...meant to do...?}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{that sunset. that last night. at unity house. remember?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{no... no, victor, i don't...}
<C>__{victor}
<P>__{(distant)}
<D>__{they all got to go. you and me... we got left behind... while they went on.}
<P>__{(chuckling)}
<D>__{guess that's why they say life ain't fair. well...}
<A>__{he opens the box. inside it are two pistols.}
<C>__{victor }
<D>__{ we can fix that.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<P>__{(stiffening)}
<D>__{my god, victor! put those away }
<A>__{he ignores her, checks the cylinder on the revolver, the clip on the automatic.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{this is so great! i mean, i've been living with all this shit, thinking about you, searching... going nowhere. and you, hell, you don't fit in with ralph and miriam, those other flakes... berrisford and goldman, they're a waste of time }
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{h how do you know about them? i never }
<A>__{he slams the clip home, closes the cylinder.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{yeah. we had the answers, way back then. unity. unity, now and forever. cynthia, this is our second chance!}
<A>__{she shrinks away from him on the bed. he bounces closer like a kid at a pajama party, holds out one of the pistols.}
<C>__{victor }
<D>__{okay, you do me, and i will do you but wait until i say go! hey, get rid of the sheet... let me see that grown up body...}
<A>__{he grins, puts the gun to her head and gets an top of her.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{no, vic. please. please! i don't want to do this!}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{yes, you do. you know you do.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{he's holding her down. he's getting into it.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{oh, cynthia, it's so beautiful.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{god, god, no }
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{we're on the edge of space and time.}
<A>__{he spreads her legs under the sheets. she's struggling against him, but it's no use. he's too strong. he's coming closer.}
<C>__{victor }
<D>__{oh, good... good... ummm... ummm...}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{cynthia, it's happening. put the gun to my head.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{jesus, vic, no!}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{yeah, oh yeah... oh, yeah }
<A>__{a shot sounds. she screams }
