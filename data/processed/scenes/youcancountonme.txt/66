<L>__{interior bank sammy's desk. morning}
<A>__{there's a note on sammy's chair. "sammy, please see me brian" sammy, just arrived at work and still in her coat, looks down at the note.}
<L>__{interior bank brian's office. day}
<A>__{sammy listens to brian.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{yeah. this doesn't apply to you directly, sammy, but i've noticed that some of the employees have their pc monitors set with all kinds of crazy colors... purple and polka dots or what have you. and it's not a big deal, but really, this is a bank. you know? it's not really appropriate. so i'm just asking that people stick to a more quote unquote normal range of colors in future...}
<A>__{sammy looks at him blankly.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{like i say, it doesn't really apply to you.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{no, my computer palette's pretty conservative.}
