<A>__{hooks sits against the prosecution table. his demeanor gentle, respectful. his voice soft.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{so the plan was for your husband to fish through the prime season. then, in november, sell the boat. and you would move onto the farm.}
<A>__{in the box, the widow sits in lovely dignity. blonde and alabaster and modest, in her black dress of mourning.}
<C>__{susan marie}
<D>__{that was his plan, yes.}
<A>__{in the press row, the boys are attentive. an angle they know they can sell. ishmael among them, watching with neutral eyes.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{whatever she said, she was hooks' star witness. the jury, especially the men, would not betray this fine lady with a not guilty verdict. how could they face her?}
<A>__{hooks walks slowly toward her. as if she were a precious object, deserving of reverence.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{can you think back for me to the morning of september 8? the day after your husband purchased the farm. one week before his death. can you recall that morning?}
<C>__{susan marie}
<D>__{i can.}
