<D>__{do we have a profile on mr. earl?}

<C>__{baffert}
<D>__{swat wants to go in.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{what's the rush? they haven't killed anybody yet this week?}
<A>__{roper refers to the folder.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{we got a guy who's probably on drugs. he's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. but he's never been busted on a major felony. what's his demeanor?}
<C>__{kimura}
<D>__{well he's a little fucking agitated he ripped the phone out.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{i have to go face to face.}
<C>__{baffert}
<D>__{no you can't do that.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{you got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded we don't know how bad it is the guy ripped the phone out swat said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. if swat makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. i gotta go in. maybe i can see what's going on in there.}
<C>__{baffert}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{he's never offed anybody. his rap doesn't show any violence.}
<C>__{baffert}
<D>__{not that we know of.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{we don't know how much time we have. if i can get in to talk to him maybe we won't lose anyone.}
<C>__{baffert}
<D>__{maybe we can get a throw phone in there.}
<C>__{kimura}
<D>__{swat says it's broken the perp in the last situation rendered it inoperable.}
<C>__{baffert}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{kimura}
<D>__{he urinated on it and shorted out the circuits.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{we gonna stand here and talk about it or let the guy in there bleed to death.}

<A>__{a team of two swat team members, forbes is a spotter and mccall is a sharpshooter. kevin mccall, is the one we're interested in. he's 25 years old, handsome, all american. he's the best the swat team has. he crouches motionless, staring through the scope of his rifle, watching as roper calmly walks toward the bank.}
<C>__{forbes}
<D>__{what do you think he's got in the bag?}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{donuts.}
<C>__{forbes}
<D>__{you can't take a guy down with a donut.}
<L>__{interior bank day}
<A>__{a tense situation. a wild eyed, white punk, fuck up of a bank robber, earl, is holding a pretty, young teller around the neck with a cocked gun held to her temple. the other bank employees are cowering on the floor. a few are giving aid to the wounded bank guard who is half conscious and oozing blood from his side. roper strolls right through the front door and walks toward earl, very sociable.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{hi, earl, i'm scott roper. wanna donut? i ate the glazed but there's a bunch of chocolate and a }
<A>__{earl swipes the donuts out of roper's hand and starts frisking roper for weapons with his free hand. the other hand still has the gun poised at the young teller's head.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{i'm a negotiator, earl. i don't carry a weapon.}
<A>__{roper smiles reassuringly at the pretty teller. it seems to help. earl finishes patting roper down, straightens back up and puts his hand around the teller's neck.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{where's the car?}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{i need to get something straight first.}
<A>__{roper looks over at the other bank employees huddled on the floor.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{who's the manager?}
<A>__{a balding, middle aged man sheepishly raises his hand.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{i am.}
<A>__{roper takes a step toward him.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{when did you start keeping longer hours?}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{last spring.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{really! because i've been thinking of moving to this branch. it would be really convenient for me }
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{hey, shut up!}
<A>__{earl wags his gun against the teller's ear.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{do you want me to start killing people?!}
<A>__{roper holds his hand up defensively.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{it's my job to see that no one gets killed, earl... including you.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{then where's my fucking car!}
<A>__{earl is pouring sweat. his gun hand is shaking uncontrollably.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{i'm getting it, earl, but we have to do this the right way.}
<A>__{roper keeps his eyes locked on earl. his voice is calm.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{first i need you to point that gun away from }
<P>__{(to the teller)}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{teller}
<P>__{(voice trembling)}
<D>__{debbie...}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{point the gun away from debbie.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{debbie's brains are going to be splattered all over the floor if i don't see a car in five minutes!}
<A>__{roper takes a long look at earl. the guy is a hair trigger.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{alright! but let's be clear about one thing. if you kill someone, i can't help you. the swat guys will take you out.}
<A>__{earl glances at the army of cop cars poised outside. reflects for a moment on the reality of the situation.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{what are my chances of getting out of here?}
<A>__{roper calmly moves toward where the wounded guard is laying.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{not bad. last month, a guy robbed a bank in daly city...}
<A>__{roper crouches down, smiles at the blurry eyed guard.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{how ya doin'?}
<A>__{the guard groans. he's not doing very well. roper peels back the bloody handkerchief, takes a look. winces.}
<C>__{roper}
<P>__{(to earl)}
<D>__{...cops gave him a car, and he lost them on the freeway.}
<A>__{earl is encouraged by that.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{absolutely. bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.}
<A>__{roper looks directly into earl's eyes.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{he didn't kill anybody, though.}
<A>__{roper bends over the guard.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{this is gonna hurt.}
<A>__{he grabs the guard under the arms and starts dragging him across the floor. the guard moans piteously.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{hey, leave him alone. what are you doing?}
<A>__{roper keeps dragging the guard toward the front door.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{it's part of my negotiator's oath. if there's an injured party and i can help them, i'm duty bound by my oath to do that. you can shoot me if you want, but the next negotiator in here is going to tell you the same thing.}
<A>__{earl is unsure what to do, but he guesses an oath is an oath. he lets roper drag the guard to the door.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{i will be right back, earl. point that gun away from debbie.}
<A>__{earl compliantly moves the gun away from the teller's head, then re thinks and jerks it back against her temple.}
<L>__{exterior bank day}
<A>__{roper drags the guard out the front door and deposits him on the sidewalk. two swat officers rush up to give aid. one of them is jennings.}
<C>__{roper}
<P>__{(whispering to jennings)}
<D>__{give me your gun.}
<A>__{(note: the method of disarming earl is still to be determined) jennings inconspicuously pulls his gun out and slips it to him. roper quickly cocks it and shoves it in his waistband under his shirt and vest.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{i haven't had to shoot anyone in three years.}
<C>__{jennings}
<D>__{why not keep the streak alive?}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{because this strung out junkie is too stupid to get out of this without killing somebody.}
<L>__{interior bank day}
<A>__{earl watches roper through the window. he can only see roper's back. he's getting very agitated.}
<C>__{earl}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{hey, what the fuck are you doing out there!}
<A>__{the two cops hustle off with the wounded guard, and roper calmly walks back into the bank. stops about five paces from earl.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{as a rule, i need one hostage released as show of good faith.}
<A>__{roper glances at debbie. gun pressed against her head. tears start rolling down her cheeks. she's being tremendously brave.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{give me debbie.}
<A>__{earl squeezes the gun even tighter against the side of her head.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{take the old guy.}
<A>__{the other hostages watch this exchange tensely.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{the old guy? what kind of show of faith is that? i want debbie.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{am i gettin' the car?}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{you're gettin' the car.}
<A>__{earl thinks about it, his gun hand twitching. he points at two of the female employees cowering against the counter.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{take them.}
<A>__{roper decides that this is the best he's going to get.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{you two, leave.}
<A>__{the two women don't need any extra encouragement. they jump up and rush out the front door.}
<L>__{exterior rooftop day}
<A>__{mccall and forbes watch through their rifle scopes as the two released hostages are whisked away by uniformed cops.}
<C>__{forbes}
<D>__{this guy is good.}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{that's what they say.}
<L>__{interior bank day}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{that was fine, earl. now i'm going to get your car.}
<A>__{roper turns around and walks toward the front door. he stops and looks over his shoulder.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{oh, there's one last thing.}
<A>__{earl looks like he's right on the edge.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{you want a convertible or hardtop?}
<A>__{earl thinks about that for a beat...}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{hardtop.}
<A>__{roper turns around, starts walking again. he keeps his eyes focused on the reflection of earl in the front window of the bank.}
<C>__{roper}
<P>__{(without turning around)}
<D>__{manual or automatic?}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{automatic.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{you got it.}
<A>__{in one swift motion, roper turns, aims and fires!... one shot. it tears into earl's shoulder. one inch from debbie's neck. earl is blown back against the counter. debbie shrieks at the top of her lungs. swat guys pour in from every entrance. yelling for everybody to "get down"! pointing guns. they pounce on earl.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{i give up! i give up!}
<A>__{roper goes to debbie, puts his arm around her and gently leads her out of the bank.}
<L>__{exterior rooftop day}
<A>__{mccall and forbes still have their rifles trained on the bank door. their police radio squawks...}
<C>__{radio}
<D>__{the situation is secured. suspect in custody. repeat. situation secured.}
<A>__{mccall lowers his rifle as roper guides debbie through the wave of cops rushing into the bank.}
<L>__{exterior street short time later}
<A>__{roper is exiting the bank and putting back on his gun when he hears the sound of a camera shutter. he turns to see veronica (ronnie) tate holding the camera. she snaps one of roper with earl in the b.g. being placed in a squad car.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{there's one for the front page.}
<A>__{roper puts his hand over his heart as if stricken with love... which he in fact is.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{ronnie, why are you torturing me? i can't live without you.}
<A>__{ronnie rolls her eyes. she doesn't take roper all that seriously.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{don't start.}
<A>__{she slings the camera over her shoulder and starts to walk off. roper dogs her.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{this baseball player you're going out with...}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{he's no good for you.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{really?! he's a wonderful guy. he makes two million a year, and he worships me.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{i worship you.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you worship yourself.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{ronnie, forget this what's his name.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{greg.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{did you know he's already got a bad knee? in another 10 years you're going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair.}
<A>__{ronnie stops. looks him in the eye.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you know what i think? i think you only want me now, because i'm with somebody else.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{who cares what you think. i want you back and that's all that matters.}
<A>__{ronnie smiles, but offers no response.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{let me take you out tomorrow night... pleeease.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i'm going out with greg tomorrow.}
<C>__{roper}
<P>__{(frowning)}

<A>__{roper gets down on his knees.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{please. i'm begging you.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{oh, i've got to get a shot of this.}
<A>__{she takes the lense cap off her camera. roper primps his hair to make sure he looks good for the picture... click! suddenly roper notices that his trans am is being towed. he rushes over to his car.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{hey, that's my car.}
<A>__{a repo man stands off to the side watching dispassionately.}

<A>__{it's across the street from the jewelry store. second story. the walls are plastered with travel posters. a poster of tahiti is the most prominent. members of police and swat are standing over a blueprint of the jewelry store spread out on a table. right behind them is a tv monitoring the front of the store. solis is at another desk, on the phone. he's talking to the suspect.}

<D>__{we're working on that, joe. these things aren't quite that simple.}

<C>__{roper}
<D>__{see this. solis has me driving the shit mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. probably worth thirty.}

<D>__{okay, you relax, and i will }

<C>__{roper}
<D>__{what do we got?}
<C>__{solis}
<D>__{32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. a unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{any verification on numbers.}
<C>__{solis}
<D>__{we've only seen and talked to one suspect. he calls himself "joe". there's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. this particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. they have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. they knew what they were coming for.}
<C>__{roper}

<L>__{interior jewelry store day}
<A>__{we don't see anything but the suspect on the other end of the phone. he's wearing a ski mask and gloves. totally unrecognizable to the audience. we will find out soon that he is, in fact, korda. he appears very cool and collected.}

<D>__{you don't have to come here.}
<L>__{interior command center day}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{yes, i do. that way there's no misunderstandings. i need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.}

<D>__{alright, roper. you want to come... come.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{good. i won't be armed. we gotta operate on trust here. we're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible.}

<A>__{roper, bulletproof vest, hands in the air, walks across the eerily deserted street straight toward the jewelry store. it's quiet now. the choppers have been pulled back. roper reaches the sidewalk right in front of the store. korda cracks the door open.}

<P>__{(warningly)}

<L>__{exterior jewelry store day}
<A>__{korda takes a half step out the doorway. the gloved hand that is visible is not holding a weapon. the other half of his body is hidden inside the doorway. he wears jeans, a black shirt, and black nike tennis shoes. he stares fiercely from behind the ski mask. there's no sign of fear in him.}
<C>__{korda}
<D>__{are you in charge, roper?}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{yep.}
<C>__{korda}
<D>__{i want a car. like a four wheel drive. i want it in perfect condition. i want a uniformed cop to drive it up right here. i want him to leave the engine running and walk to the end of the street. then we'll come out. i don't want any remote control devices in it. i know all the tricks. if it's not in perfect condition, and i mean if its even low on wiper fluid, i'm going to kill somebody and we're gonna start again.}
<A>__{korda lets that sink in.}
<C>__{korda}
<D>__{i want a plane waiting at the airport. i will tell them where i want to go when i get there.}

<D>__{is that all?}
<C>__{korda}
<D>__{for now that's all.}

<D>__{you'll get it. but, joe, i want you to do something for me. let me take a look around inside. make sure everybody's okay.}
<C>__{korda}
<D>__{no. you just do shit for me right now.}
<A>__{korda's eyes glare from behind the ski mask. he's an ominous figure.}

<D>__{joe, i'm doing a lot for you. i think you could give me something to cement the deal... one hostage.}
<C>__{korda}
<D>__{i will give you something.}
<A>__{korda pulls a wadded up handkerchief out of his pocket and tosses it to roper. roper unwraps the handkerchief.}

<A>__{it's a human ear.}
<C>__{korda}
<D>__{in fifteen minutes it'll be a bigger piece. i assume there are no "misunderstanding".}

<D>__{we're going to have to take this guy out.}
<A>__{that draws a long silence. that's something roper rarely says.}
<C>__{solis}
<D>__{can't we wear him down?}
<A>__{roper hands solis the handkerchief with the ear in it. solis eyes it with dismay.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{i believe there's at least one fatality in there already. the fire alarm was probably set off by gunfire. i believe he's working alone, both from his conversation and the fact that he wouldn't come out beyond the doorway. he was holding a gun on the hostages while he was talking to me. his demeanor is calm and controlled, that's what really scares me. the other bad news is that he also indicated a familiarity with our techniques.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{so, do you want to go in or wait for him to come out?}
<A>__{mccall calmly offers his opinion.}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{let him come out. too many unknowns in there.}
<A>__{solis nods. that'll be the plan.}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{when we drive up the car, make sure it's at an angle about three feet from the curb.}

<D>__{i feel this thing going sideways on us.}
<A>__{roper tries to buck him up.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{there is some good news. he's wearing a ski mask, so he's protecting his identity and hasn't determined to kill all the hostages...}
<P>__{(big pause)}
<D>__{yet.}
<L>__{interior jewelry store day}
<A>__{the jewel thief pulls off his ski mask to reveal he is korda. his face is sweaty. hair matted. angle widens to show five very scared hostages: a jeweler, middle aged, balding. the male manager, good looking, thirties, three piece suit. two salesgirls, nicely dressed, late twenties. a female customer, gray haired hillsborough matron. they are all seated against the wall. there are two fatalities lying on the floor. the guard and one of the jewelers. korda points his gun at the manager and the other jeweler and motions to the dead bodies.}
<C>__{korda}
<D>__{drag them behind the counter.}
<A>__{the two men reluctantly get to their feet and commence the grim task. the two salesgirls watch korda fearfully. the older female customer seems to be in a lesser state of reality. her eyes are a bit far away. korda moves over to the remaining display cases that haven't been looted. with the barrel of his gun, he smashes the glass, reaches in and picks out the jewelry. he dumps it in an open satchel already half filled with packets of raw gemstones and gold chains. suddenly, the older woman customer gets to her feet. she seems fairly out of it. maybe in shock. she starts walking toward the front door frowning with dissatisfaction.}
