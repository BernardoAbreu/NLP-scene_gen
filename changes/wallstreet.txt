<LOC>__{EXT. WALL STREET - EARLY MORNING}
<TRANS>__{FADE IN:}
<ACTION>__{. THE STREET. The most famous third of a mile in the world. Towering landmark structures nearly blot out the dreary grey flannel sky. The morning rush hour crowds swarm through the dark, narrow streets like mice in a maze, all in pursuit of one thing: MONEY... CREDITS RUN.}
<LOC>__{INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - EARLY MORNING}
<ACTION>__{We hear the ROAR of the trains pulling out of the station. Blurred faces, bodies, suits, hats, attache cases float into view pressed like sardines against the sides of a door which now open, releasing an outward velocity of anger and greed, one of them BUD FOX.}
<LOC>__{EXT. SUBWAY EXIT - MORNING}
<ACTION>__{The bubbling mass charges up the stairs. Steam rises from a grating, shapes merging into the crowd. Past the HOMELESS VETS, the insane BAG LADY with 12 cats and 20 shopping bags huddled in the corner of Trinity Church... Bud the Fox straggling behind, in a crumpled raincoat, tie askew, young, very young, his bleary face buried in a Wall Street Journal, folded, 'subway style', as he crosses the street against the light.}

<DIAL>__{Why Fox? Why didn't you buy... schmuck?}
<ACTION>__{A car honks, swerving past.}
<LOC>__{INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Cavernous modern lobby. Bodies cramming into elevators. Bud, stuffing the newspaper into his coat, jams in.}
<LOC>__{INT. ELEVATOR - MORNING}
<ACTION>__{Blank faces stare ahead, each lost in private thoughts, Bud again mouthing the thought, "stupid schmuck", his eyes catching a blond executive who quickly flicks her eyes away. Paranoia in the elevator. We quickly cut into private lives.}
<CHAR>__{WORRIED MAN } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}

<ACTION>__{His eyes on the same blonde exec who looks away, self- conscious about her legs. The elevator stops at a floor, discards only one person. The doors close a little too slowly.}
<CHAR>__{BLONDE EXECUTIVE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{... jerk...}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(shifts her thoughts)}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(pause, the elevator at another floor, slow)}
<DIAL>__{... wonder what all these people are thinking about.}

<CHAR>__{WORRIED MAN } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{...goddamn elevators!...people, too many goddamn people in this world!}
<ACTION>__{The elevator finally comes to a slow stop... They wait, plead, beg, screech with the eyes. The door at last opens. None of them acknowledging each other, they all stampede out the door with an audible gasp of release, a collective sign akin to making it to a urinal after a punishing wait... The elevator tension is over, but the killer grind continues.}

<ACTION>__{He slips off his overcoat, flicks some lint off his Paul Stuart $500 suit, and enters the main trading room. Brokers mill by their desks, gulping coffee, scanning the papers, the quotrons. The digital clock by the big board counter clicks to 9:26 am -- four minutes until the market opens. You can smell the hunger. Bud takes a deep breath, tosses the newspaper away and struts into the office -- fuck it -- it's a new day. MOVING past DAN STEEPLES, a flush-faced old-timer, a blue and white Yale tie, with a carnation in his lapel.}

<DIAL>__{Joke about it. I was up all night charting these stocks. You want to see this or what?}
<ACTION>__{His associate, MARVIN, a manicky wise-guy, swivels over his chair from a nearby desk. He gives the charts a quick read.}

<DIAL>__{Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got it all upside down.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(confidential)}

<DIAL>__{Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare.}
<ACTION>__{LOU MANNHEIM, strolls in, a dignified looking older broker in his late 60's, wearing an old brown brim hat with button down white shirt, narrow tie, very much a picture from another era... a kind humor in his eyes... but obviously ailing in the legs and breath department.}

<DIAL>__{Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world.

<CHAR>__{LYNCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Attention. Please. Office Production is down ten percent this week. I recommend that you all go through your clients' investments for any portfolio adjustments. And don't forget -- double commissions today on our 'A' or better bond funds.}

<DIAL>__{And they're off and running!}
<ACTION>__{The room rises to a subtle but new energy level with the clatter of the ticker, speakers, teletype machines, newsprinters' Dow Jones and Reuters, phones ringing off the hook. Brokers are shouting orders, running for tickets, dodging each other; it's a controlled riot.}

<DIAL>__{Here's a hot lead... Have I got one for you.... sell ... dump it all!! ... 500 at an eighth, an eighth!... July fifties. April thirties...how bout those Decembers?

<TRANS>__{DISSOLVE TO:}
<ACTION>__{THE CLOCK... It's 2.30 p.m. We hear the relentless clatter of the board ticker, and the drone of disembodied voices, blarihg market information out of squawk boxes. Bud's desk is now cluttered with order tickets, literature, crumpled notes, beverage cups and a half-eaten sandwich. He's on the phone and from the look on his face, the caller on the other end is breaking his balls. Marvin paces past, making a dramatic phone pitch.}

The original fundamental reason for Wall Street was to capitalize American business, underwrite new business, build companies, build America. The "deal" has now succeeded goods and services as America's gross national product and in the process, we are undermining our foundation. This cancer is called "greed". Greed and speculation have replaced long-term investment. Corporations are being taken apart like erector sets, without any consideration of the public good.

<DIAL_PAR>__{(gets another laugh)}
<DIAL>__{...well ladies and gentlemen, we're not here to indulge in fantasies, but in political and economic reality. America has become a second rate power. Our trade deficit and fiscal deficit are at nightmare proportions. In the days of the 'free market' when our country was a top industrial power, there was accountability to the shareholders. The Carnegies, the Mellons, the man who built this industrial empire, made sure of it because it was their money at stake. Today management has no stake in the company. Altogether these guys sitting up there own a total of less than 3% and where does Mr. Cromwell put his million dollar salary? Certainly not in Teldar stock, he owns less than 1%. You own Teldar Paper, the stockholders, and you are being royally screwed over by these bureaucrats with their steak lunches, golf and hunting trips, corporate jets, and golden parachutes! Teldar Paper has 33 different vice presidents each earning over $200,000 a year. I spent two months analyzing what these guys did and I still can't figure it out.}

<DIAL>__{The new law of evolution in corporate America seems to be 'survival of the unfittest'. Well in my book, you either do it right or you get eliminated. Teldar Paper is doomed to fail. Its diversification into casualty insurance has not worked. Its crown jewels are its trees, the rest is dross. Through wars, depressions, inflations and deterioration of paper money, trees have always kept their value, but Teldar is chopping them all down. Forests are perishable, forest rights are as important as human rights to this planet, and all the illusory Maginot lines, scorched earth tactics, proxy fights, poison pills, etc. that Mr. Cromwell is going to come up with to prevent people like me from buying Teldar Paper are doomed to fail because the bottom line, ladies and gentlemen, as you very well know, is the only way to stay strong is to create value, that's why you buy stock, to have it go up. If there's any other reason, I've never hear it.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(laughter)}
<DIAL>__{That's all I'm saying...it's you people who own this company, not them, they work for you and they've done a lousy job of it. Get rid of them fast, before you all get sick and die. I may be an opportunist, but if these clowns did a better job, I'd be out of work. In the last seven deals I've been in, there were 2.3 million stockholders that actually made a pretax profit of $12 billion. When I bought the Ixtlan Corporation it was in the exact same position Teldar is today -- I turned three of its companies private and I sold four others -- and each of these companies, liberated from the suffering conglomerate has prospered. I am not a destroyer of companies, I am a liberator of them. The point is, ladies and gentlemen, greed is good. Greed works, greed is right. Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit. Greed in all its forms, greed for life, money, love, knowledge, has marked the upward surge of mankind -- and greed, mark my words -- will save not only Teldar Paper but that other malfunctioning corporation called the USA...Thank you.}

Effective inventory management through computerization will increase our load factor by 5 to 20%, that translates to approximately 50 to 200 million dollars in revenues; the point is, we can beat the majors at a price war.
