<D>__{in addition to the arguments above enumerated for lifting this injunction, we wish to cite the decision of the high court of paris, rendered in the case of princess marishka against the government of montenegro on the fifth day of august, 1897. comparing the facts in that case with our present set of facts we feel that the treaty between the republic of france and the u.s.s.r. should prevail over all...}

<D>__{i know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the court. we're helpless, aren't we?}
<C>__{lawyer}
<D>__{yes. it is unfortunate.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{well, there's nothing we can do about it. why get excited?}
<A>__{the three russians as well as the lawyers are puzzled. the russians exchange hopeful glances.}
<C>__{lawyer}

<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{au revoir.}
<A>__{the lawyers leave. left alone with the russians, ninotchka is unable to conceal her happiness entirely.}

<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{huh?... why don't you get a haircut, buljanoff? you all look so wintry, comrades. and why do we always keep the windows closed?}
<P>__{(she opens the window)}
<D>__{isn't it amazing, at home there's still snow and ice and here... look at the birds. i always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries. now i know why. we have the high ideal but they have the climate... well, comrades, i don't think i need you any more.}
<C>__{kopalski}

<C>__{all three russians}
<D>__{thank you, comrade.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{have you any money?}
