<L>__{interior underground garage fbi incident center night}
<A>__{a well lit, sectioned off area of the garage secured by a chain link fence. phipps enters. as he passes dray, already there }
<C>__{phipps}
<D>__{how long before we have a secure computer network?}
<C>__{dray}
<D>__{an hour. they're building it now.}
<A>__{phipps moves to a forensic expert hovering over a table of small fragments.}
<C>__{phipps}
<D>__{what do you got? forensic expert #1 pieces of a pager oxidized with trace elements of semtex. probably the triggering device. they dial it up, probably from a cell phone, and boom...}
<A>__{he picks up a microchip.}
<D>__{forensic expert #1 ... this is the memory chip. i can build it into a working pager and maybe get a number readout.}
<C>__{phipps}
<D>__{do it.}
<A>__{phipps moves to the next work area, where another forensic expert studies video from a consulate surveillance camera.}
<B>__{on screen}
<A>__{in super slow mo, we see a cop the one who later bumped into gordy in front of the consulate. his hat is pulled down over his eyes, almost concealing his tinted glasses. as the cop faces more toward the camera, the expert freeze frames. to phipps forensic expert #2}
<D>__{forensic expert #2 that's as much face as we get. he was careful to duck the camera.}
<C>__{phipps}
<D>__{run a total analysis. i want to know if this asshole's right or left handed. i want everything you can get outta this film.}
<A>__{phipps keeps moving, enters an eerie recreation of the blast site. streets, buildings, etc. are marked out on the garage floor. pieces of the navigators rest in front of the area marked "consulate;" parts of an nypd traffic scooter rest in front of the navigators; "x's" mark where anne and matt were standing. phipps crosses to another agent.}
<C>__{phipps}
<D>__{any helpful information coming outta colombia?}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{not yet. sat intel hasn't picked up any related data traffic, either.}
<A>__{dray walks up.}
<C>__{dray}
<D>__{gordon pitt's here. he says he saw a cop at the scene.}
<A>__{same scene later gordy, accompanied by mike and ronnie, sits in front of a video monitor. phipps and dray look on.}
<B>__{on screen}
<A>__{a police cart pulls up outside the consulate.}
<C>__{phipps}
<D>__{the cart was stolen from the central park precinct yesterday.}
<A>__{the cop gets out of the scooter.}
<C>__{gordy}
<D>__{that's him. that's the son of a bitch i bumped into.}
<A>__{the cop tickets a vehicle, then walks west out of frame.}
<C>__{phipps}
<D>__{the bomb's in the cart.}
<B>__{phipps}
<A>__{reverses the video, freeze frames on the cop.}
<C>__{phipps}
<D>__{we think the bomb was triggered by a cell phone. the guy doesn't have one in his hands here. did you see a cell phone when you ran into him?}
<C>__{gordy}
<D>__{... no.}
<C>__{phipps}
<D>__{how much time passed between then and the explosion?}
<C>__{gordy}
<D>__{... seconds... five, ten...}
<C>__{phipps}
<D>__{we think maybe he got into the brown ford. you see him then?}
<C>__{gordy}
<D>__{all i cared about was getting to my wife and boy.}
<C>__{dray}
<P>__{(to phipps)}
<D>__{guy still had enough time to get out a phone and dial it in.}
<C>__{phipps}
<P>__{(beat, then, by way of ending it)}
<D>__{we might need to call you in again to look at some photos.}
<A>__{beat. gordy looks back at the grainy image of the cop.}
