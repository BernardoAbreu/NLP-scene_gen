<P>__{(suggesting ed take first crack)}
<D>__{dubonnet with a twist? baby sham? tomato juice and tabasco sauce?}

<P>__{(to bartender)}
<D>__{got a coke?}
<L>__{interior valentine's bedroom. afternoon.}
<A>__{valentine is checking himself in a full length mirror. tv on in background, sound low (entertainment week!). not quite satisfied, valentine crosses to the bathroom.}
<B>__{bathroom}
<A>__{valentine takes one more closer look.}
<C>__{adhara }
<D>__{you have the same posters.}
<A>__{valentine turns.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{hmm?}
<B>__{adhara}
<A>__{is lounging in the large tub. staring dreamily at a couple of framed posters on the walls: more 60's psychedelia.}
<C>__{adhara}
<D>__{that you have down at your office.}
<A>__{valentine sits on the edge of the tub. with a nostalgic air as he looks at her: the embodiment of youth.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{different ones.}
<A>__{he strokes her wet skin. they kiss lightly.}
<C>__{adhara}

<D>__{it must've been a time. a golden moment.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{have you ever dreamed of a place ... you don't really recall ever having been to ... a place that probably doesn't even exist except in your imagination ... somewhere far away, half remembered when you wake up ... but when you were there you spoke the language, you knew your way around ...}
<P>__{(significant pause)}
<D>__{that was the 60's.}
<A>__{with that exit line (practiced?), he starts to go. then pauses, turns again.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{no, it wasn't. wasn't either.}
<A>__{comes back to her. faraway look in his eyes.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{it was '66 ... early '67.}
<P>__{(comes back to now)}
<D>__{that was all.}
<A>__{he goes.}
