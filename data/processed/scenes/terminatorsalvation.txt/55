<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior mutant forest night}
<A>__{the moon over a scrubby forest, trees just a few feet high. blair and marcus seem like giants as they move among them. they've been talking a while, blair's absorbing something.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{so let me get this straight, marcus. there you are on death row, they stick a needle in your arm...}
<C>__{blair }
<D>__{and the next thing you know, you're here.}
<P>__{(off his nod)}
<D>__{since this ain't the resurrection, there's only one possibility.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{let's hear it.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{whatever they pumped into your veins just knocked you out. this angel project you signed up for there was a lotta cryogenic stuff going on before the bombs fell, they musta froze your ass.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{what the hell for?}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{drug tests, medical experiments, organ harvesting, who knows? you said you had no family, no friends why let a body like yours go to waste?}
<A>__{she's looking him over as she says this, it almost sounds flirtatious. marcus changes the subject.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{i've never seen trees like these.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{we're in a mutation zone. i saw a two headed squirrel here once }
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{freaky.}
<C>__{blair}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{tasted like chicken.}
<A>__{blair pauses, checking a small geiger counter she carries it clicks a bit.}
<C>__{blair }
<D>__{levels are tolerable now, but just. we can't spend the night here.}
<A>__{they start moving again. marcus pauses, listens:}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{i didn't hear anything }
<A>__{now they both hear an eerie howl, changing in pitch like a coyote on crack. more than one picks up the chorus.}
<C>__{blair }
<D>__{skindogs.}
<A>__{she pulls a sidearm, holds it at the ready as she starts running, away from the direction of the noise. marcus keeps up at her side, looking behind them.}
<B>__{with the dogs}
<A>__{we don't get a good look at them, but there's a pack of large beasts moving quickly through the undergrowth, gaining on the fleeing humans. blair sees they won't outrun them. she spins, fires in the direction of the approaching pack. suddenly it's quiet the animals fan out, forming a circle around blair and marcus.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{they're surrounding us.}
<A>__{quick shots of mutant eyes, glowing in the dark enlarged teeth dark, massive forms moving through the brush.}
<C>__{blair}
<D>__{they're smart. and they don't scare easy.}
<A>__{after a few tense beats, from the foliage a skindog leaps at blair from behind it's hideous, the size of a great dane, hairless, with veiny, wrinkled skin and long, catlike claws. before blair can react, marcus leaps between her and the dog, grabs the slavering creature by the throat. it snaps its elongated teeth at him, but he manages to break its neck and hurl it toward two more skindogs moving in for an attack. blair fires a few shots at the encroaching pack, we hear a few yelps marcus protects her, effortlessly tosses a few more skindogs aside, ignoring vicious bites and scratches. the other skindogs turn on dead and injured pack members, begin tearing into them. there's an opening now, the two humans make a run for it. blair catches her breath, looking him over, seriously impressed by his strength and calm.}
<C>__{blair }
<D>__{you saved my ass. thanks.}
<A>__{marcus shrugs, turns back to see the feeding frenzy.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{dog eat dog world.}
