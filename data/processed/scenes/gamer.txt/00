<L>__{interior train day}
<A>__{darkness now the beautiful chiming sounds of space travel through the cosmos... dots of light whiz past our face. they could be stars at lightspeed, or... subway lights flicker on in a flash we see pale, sullen faces, riding into a bleak future, and hear the industrial clatter. it's dark, claustrophobic, obscure... the rhythmic beat of track and wheel clicks engulf us. the lights flicker back on and hold as we see a half dozen soldiers in brown camo, steel eyed, prepared for whatever may be at the end of the tunnel. zero in on two: kable, 30 something, roughneck... focused, determined; eyes burning with internalized emotion... ... and sandra, late 20s, undeniably hot but tough as hell both are in shackles & cuffs, being roughly transported through underground tunnels, knocked and shoved around. uniformed guards roam the train, looking pissed off their swagger seems to mask fear. kable is meditating, or exhausted hard to tell. the girl makes eye contact w him.}

<A>__{crackk!! crack!! crackk!! ... crack!! sandra is buckled over, awkwardly, hands behind her back tethered to the seat, head dripping blood. kable jerks against his restraints, every inch of him wanting to rip the motherfucker apart... he uses his elbow to help her back up, but sandra fights through it, sits back up and spits blood she can handle herself. the camera holds tight on kable and sandra... kable lets a glob of blood dangle from his mouth, biting his lip, bearing it... we hear the crunching sound of the club working on the others... and the metallic rumble and clatter of the train growing louder, pounding, slamming into our brains, blotting out all thought... until...}
