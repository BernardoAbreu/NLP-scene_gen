<L>__{interior main cabin sunrise}
<A>__{dawn glows orange in the skylights above the cabin. the only sound is the heavy, even breathing of slumber. suddenly, a booming voice rumbles down the companionway.}
<C>__{lawford }
<D>__{arise, arise, arise...}
<A>__{chuck wakes, disoriented. terry bolts upright and hits his head on the low ceiling. ouch. tod, rick and charlie are up instantly. lawford's voice echoes through the ship.}
<C>__{lawford }
<D>__{exultation is the going of an inland soul to sea past the houses past the headlands into deep eternity bred as we, among the mountains can the sailor understand the divine intoxication of the first league out from land?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{but i suppose we'll answer that question soon enough gentlemen. soon enough.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{what question?}
<A>__{chuck tries to assimilate lawford's words. robin swings his feet over the side of his bunk with a tortured look. john rolls over and pulls his pillow over his head.}
<C>__{robin}
<P>__{(foggy)}
<D>__{what the hell is going on?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{maybe it's an air raid.}
<A>__{in crisply pressed shorts and shirt, bill butler steps through the aft bulkhead. he raises a bowswain's whistle and blows. ooowwweeeeooo!!!! chuck and robin grab their ears. it's a nightmare. terry jumps and hits his head again.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{roll out sailors! all hands on deck! sixty seconds. sixty seconds.}
<A>__{he blows the whistle again. this time it brings even john to his feet, staring down at bill in a blind rage. bill looks up and casually notices him.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you gotta problem goodall?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you blow that thing again i will shove it so far up your ass, you're gonna need dental floss to get it out.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{just get on deck.}
<A>__{bill turns and disappears topside.}
