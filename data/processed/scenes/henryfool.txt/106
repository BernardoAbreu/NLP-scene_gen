<A>__{later that evening. the whole neighborhood is celebrating fay's wedding. the music is loud. the people are drunk. the place is a shambles. a big dance number is playing. amidst all the festivities, though, simon and bunuel have the small tv propped up on top of the fridge, following the evening news...}

<D>__{it all started right here in queens, jim, at world of donuts about one year ago today, when local garbage man, simon grim, put pencil to paper and began to compose what many have come to regard as vicious, antisocial and pornographic poetry 112 lines of unrhymed free meter verse which would one day serve to spark the flames of controversy across the nation and indeed the world.}

<D>__{this is outrageous! measures must be taken. have we debased our culture to such an extent that a garbage man with a head full of sick ideas is legitimately referred to as a poet, and where the filth he spews can be accessed by any child old enough to turn on a computer? is this what we have come to? not the transmission of our highest ideals, but a cynical, atheistic delirium!}

<P>__{(on tv)}
<D>__{poetry of this kind, and this poem in particular, is, i think, a worthy form of desperation; a digression on the extremes of human experience; of solitude, of community. it is perhaps alarming, even upsetting to some myself included but it must be allowed to exist.}
<A>__{henry throws an arm around warren, who stands looking dejected in the doorway, and raises his glass to the happiness in the room.}

<D>__{meanwhile, in rome today, the pope issued a message of hope for believers in their fight against what he termed the godless and lost. he did not mention simon grim by name, but offered a prayer for the young whom he described as sadly in need of faith and not the illusion of conviction offered by rock music, drugs and contemporary poetry.}
<A>__{the tv is switched off. it's later now. people are passed out on the kitchen floor and various neighbors are sitting around the table. fay steps back from the tv, drains a glass of beer and wipes her mouth on the sleeve of her wedding gown. she hugs simon, who is deeply unsettled by the news of his growing infamy.}

<D>__{god, simon, i mean, like, you're a total fucking rock star.}
