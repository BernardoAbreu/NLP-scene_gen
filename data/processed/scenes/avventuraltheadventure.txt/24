<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{at the princess' villa, claudia is in her room, applying some fresh make up in front of a small dressing table. although she appears thoroughly engrossed in all the minute details of her make up, nevertheless, she seems considerably interested in any sound that comes through her window. the rumble of a motor is heard. claudia runs to the window and looks out into the garden. a dark car pulls up in front of the service entrance. a uniformed chauffeur gets out of the car and enters the house carrying a package under his arm. there is an obvious look of disappointment on claudia's face. she is about to return to the dressing table when she notices, there in the garden, giulia heading towards the house accompanied by the young prince, goffredo. claudia is profoundly shocked by giulia's behavior as she laughs, jokes, bends over to pick up some flowers, and skips along unashamedly. in the meantime, patrizia has entered the room with two wigs, one of which she is wearing and the other in her hand. she also has on a cocktail dress, but one that is more elaborate than claudia's. patrizia immediately goes up to the mirror of the dressing table and, while she finishes arranging the wig on her head, says to her friend:}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{are you ready? i'm not. that's all we needed a cocktail party... the vitality some people have irritates me!}
<P>__{(indicating the wig on her head)}
<D>__{how does it look?}
<A>__{claudia, who has meanwhile tried on the other wig and is looking at herself in the mirror, turns around to patrizia.}
<C>__{claudia}
<P>__{(ironically)}
<D>__{it's divine!}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{you say that just to flatter me.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{do you consider that a compliment?}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{the two of them burst out laughing and together they leave the room. then after a few steps through the corridor, they separate with a friendly gesture towards each other. patrizia goes into her room while claudia prepares to descend the wide stairway. coming up the same stairway are giulia and the young prince, goffredo. there is something of an embarrassing moment between them. then giulia, aware of claudia's presence, detaches herself from goffredo and, as they reach the top of the stairs, she comes over to claudia and takes her by the wrist in order to confide with her more intimately.}
<C>__{giulia}
<D>__{he wants to show me his paintings. he won't let go of me anymore. poor thing, he must have a crush on me...}
<A>__{she laughs with an obvious sense of amusement, but she is also tickled by her own vanity. claudia looks at her without knowing what to say to her.}
<C>__{giulia}
<P>__{(even more excited)}
<D>__{please, you come too...}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{but for what reason should i come there?}
<C>__{giulia}
<D>__{please, do come... don't leave me alone with him. he's capable of... i don't know... have you noticed his eyes?}
<A>__{claudia resigns herself to escorting giulia to the floor up above. the very top of the stairway leads to an attic, where goffredo is leaning over the railing, looking down.}
<C>__{goffredo}
<D>__{giulia...}
<C>__{giulia}
<D>__{here i am.}
<A>__{seeing the two of them arriving together, the young prince feels disappointed. but he knows he has to cover his intentions with a show of good manners. when the two women reach the top of the stairs, he bows to claudia in a most respectful fashion. then he leads them down a low and narrow corridor to a door they pass through. the attic is bright and spacious, with slanted roof, and two huge windows. it is filled with paintings, easels, canvases, brushes and oils. as soon as giulia enters the studio, she moves away from claudia and attaches herself to the young prince who is setting up one of his paintings on an easel beside one of the windows. claudia looks around the room with a sense of indifference. going over to the window, she looks out and sees a vast panorama of the countryside. giulia looks at the painting with a certain amount of surprise. it is a picture of a nude woman; a shapely figure, slightly plump, in the manner of renoir.}
<C>__{giulia}
<D>__{claudia, come and see. it's a nude.}
<A>__{claudia is looking through the paintings that lean up against the wall face backwards. she turns one around: a nude woman. a second: another nude woman. a third: the same.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{they're all nudes, if i'm not mistaken.}
<C>__{giulia}
<P>__{(to goffredo)}
<D>__{but why all nudes?}
<C>__{goffredo}
<D>__{because there is no landscape as beautiful as a woman.}
<C>__{giulia}
<D>__{and where do you find the models?}
<C>__{goffredo}
<D>__{oh, there are as many as one wants.}
<C>__{giulia}
<P>__{(turning to claudia)}
<D>__{i thought the model was something obsolete nowadays. didn't you, claudia?}
<A>__{claudia goes back to look out the window: a group of flying birds swoops down to land directly under the roof. the birds settle themselves in a little nest directly in front of the window. claudia bends over to get a better look and is actually able to see the little nest, as she hears behind her the exchange of remarks between giulia and the young prince.}
<C>__{goffredo}
<D>__{it's strange how anxious women are to display themselves. it's almost a natural inclination.}
<C>__{giulia}
<D>__{but how could they pose like that? i couldn't.}
<C>__{goffredo}
<P>__{(with a grave, youthful sensuality)}
<D>__{why don't you try?}
<C>__{giulia}
<D>__{me... goffredo, you're mad!}
<P>__{(turning to claudia)}
<D>__{he's mad.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{not really.}
<A>__{claudia moves away from the window, and continues to look at giulia and goffredo with a deep sense of amazement. giulia is euphoric, kittenish and trembling with excitement. goffredo is firm, resolute and serious.}
<C>__{giulia}
<D>__{don't you ever paint men?}
<C>__{goffredo}
<D>__{answer me, why don't you try posing? i will paint you a beautiful portrait.}
<C>__{giulia}
<D>__{but why me?... ask claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.}
<C>__{goffredo}
<P>__{(insistent)}
<D>__{but i want to paint you. you appeal to me more.}
<C>__{giulia}
<P>__{(timidly)}
<D>__{i appeal to you more?}
<A>__{giulia glances over at claudia, who is still preoccupied looking out of the window, then screws up her courage and boldly advances towards goffredo, making her intentions clearly understood. goffredo immediately responds to her invitation and draws himself close up against her. there is a moment of hesitation, then a kiss awkward but passionately violent. giulia, on her part, is completely shameless. claudia turns around exactly at that moment when the two of them are caught up in a feverish embrace. she looks at them, completely dumbfounded, then takes a few steps forward as though she doesn't believe her own eyes.}
<C>__{claudia}
<P>__{(almost unconsciously)}
<D>__{giulia!}
<A>__{giulia quickly turns around, her face is flushed with excitement but also with an expression that seems somewhat triumphant. before anybody has a chance to say anything, she heads towards the door, swings it open and stands firmly on the threshold, obviously intent on telling claudia to leave. in fact, claudia doesn't wait to be told but immediately walks out into the hallway.}
<C>__{giulia}
<D>__{and tell corrado, too, that i'm here... if he wants me. you can also tell him that my tiny little heart is beating like mad, and that at this moment, it's the only thing that interests me. is that clear?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{it couldn't be any clearer.}
<A>__{giulia takes a few steps backward into the room, and seeing claudia still there looking at her strangely, exclaims:}
<C>__{giulia}
<D>__{now what do i have to do to be left in peace?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i think all you have to do, giulia, is to close the door.}
<A>__{and with a violent bang that leaves claudia startled, giulia slams the door shut. claudia remains standing there for a moment, still very much amazed. but she is aroused from her stupor by the sound of a car pulling into the courtyard. then she rapidly starts descending the stairs. claudia has reached the hallway leading out to the garden and is anxiously waiting there, looking at the car that has just arrived. but she is not able to distinguish exactly who it is, and her view is also blocked by ettore and corrado who have just come out of the house and are now standing in front of the car. so she walks out to the garden and joins the group. a certain look of disappointment spreads over her face as she sees only raimondo come out of the car. evidently, sandro has not been located.}
<C>__{raimondo}
<D>__{he's not at the hotel... and he probably wasn't even in milazzo. the room clerk said he rented a car...}
<A>__{claudia moves away from the group, as though she has heard enough. she goes over to lean against an enormous vase standing there on the side. her hands are trembling. in back of her she hears the sounds of the others' voices but cannot distinguish what they are saying. then patrizia arrives and calls out claudia's name. but she has to repeat it a second time before claudia realizes she is being called.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{claudia... let's go.}
<A>__{claudia turns around but doesn't move. another car pulls up, driven by the same chauffeur who had evidently picked her up the other day, and in which the princess is already seated.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i'm not coming.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{but then why did you bother changing?}
<A>__{patrizia remains puzzled for a moment as though searching for a motive behind claudia's sudden decision, then discreetly turns away without insisting and goes over to the car. in the meantime, giulia and goffredo have come out through the hallway and head towards one of the two cars. corrado looks at them with a cold and critical stare, then with a deliberate intent to prick giulia's feelings, he says:}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{giulia is like oscar wilde; give her the superfluous and she will do without the essential.}
<A>__{ettore breaks out into a laugh as he helps patrizia into the car.}
<C>__{ettore}
<D>__{that's him; he'd die if he didn't have somebody to quote. he comes up with quotations like that even at a board of directors meeting...}
<A>__{claudia watches them getting into the car. she is beside herself, completely wrapped up in her own thoughts.}
