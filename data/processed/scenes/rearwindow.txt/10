<A>__{jeff's attention is now drawn to another feature of his backyard entertainment. the camera is now focused on the window of the small building where we earlier saw the girl behind the oscillating fan. loud ballet music is pouring from her open window. the girl, now dressed in dark and revealing leotard, and ballet slippers, has just turned away from a portable record player. she begins the first graceful movement of a modern ballet interpretation. she gracefully moves across the room to the rhythm of the music and dance, toward the ice box. with her feet still moving, she throws open the door, and then rhythmically moving back to the center of the room, gnaws the chicken bone, occasionally waving it in the air as part of the choreography. she now twirls over toward a table at the other side of the room on which is an open package of bread slices, some butter nearby. with swaying body, she puts down the chicken leg, and gracefully and rhythmically butters a slice of bread. she picks up both bread and chicken leg and continues her interpretive dance, alternately munching the bread and butter and chicken leg.}
