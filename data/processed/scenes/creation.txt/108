<A>__{the sickly darwin of the present sits hunched and nauseous, with parslow sitting beside him with his suitcase on his lap. every jolt of the train sends a spasm of pain through darwin's guts. the people sitting opposite a woman, a child, and a man regard darwin in silence. whatever he suffers from its not good and they are worried about getting infected with it they plunge into a tunnel. the carriage fills with smoke. parslow gets up and tries to close the window but it won't budge. a burning ember flies inside and lands on darwin's leg. darwin is too weak to lift a finger. parslow slaps the ember and extinguishes it.}
