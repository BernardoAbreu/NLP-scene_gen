<A>__{rush and mega haul flynn along a narrow ledge.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{there. you can make it across!}
<A>__{he points to a thin ledge on the other side, far below. rush extends his light pole to the ledge, moves to gather flynn for a vault crossing.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{no, take mega! i will stay here and run interference.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{you haven't got a chance by yourself.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{ah, these guys are wimps.}
<A>__{it's bravado: they know his odds are dismal. flynn slumps into an alcove, which is only big enough for him. he pulls a supply of spiked mini disks, ready to defend himself.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{we're not leaving you.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{my body is weak, but my will is strong. i promise, no matter what they do to me, i will survive this. trust the bigger plan.}
<A>__{he's fading fast.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{but flynn }
<A>__{x takks attack along the ledge.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{go! now!}
<A>__{rush throws his arm around mega and vaults across the moat, landing on the far side gaining a slim foot hold below a core entry pointerior flynn chooses his moment, leans out and throws. his mini disks take out x takks on the ledge. their bodies tumble into the moat, flashing as they hit. flynn spins, the wall behind him opens. at the end of a square corridor stands: plexor. flanked by his four snarling cybavor beasts.}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{flynn. your moment of obsolescence is upon you.}
<A>__{across the moat, rush and mega climb to the entry pointerior flynn plays for time, stalling plexor so he doesn't catch sight of them.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{freedom, plexor. it's the better idea. that's why mega chose my side.}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{if an idea is erased from all memory banks, it can be neither good nor bad. when each alternative has been removed, x net will simply be.}
<A>__{with a hand signal, he commands his cybavors. they raise up, poised to attack flynn.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{crash me. hack me. do what you want. the yearning for freedom will last forever.}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{nice speech... user!}
<A>__{he flicks a finger. cybavors gallop at flynn.}
