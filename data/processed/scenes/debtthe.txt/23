<A>__{rachel finishes reading and puts the book down. nobody moves. the air of bonhomie has been replaced by an uneasy silence. not knowing what else to do, one of the guests begins to clap and the others hurriedly join in. rachel doesn't acknowledge the applause. stephan is staring at her with a strange intensity.}
<L>__{int exterior stephen's car. tel aviv night}
<A>__{stephan and rachel sit in the back of the car. behind a screen the young mossad agent we saw earlier sits in the front next to the driver. tel aviv races by in neon smears. the air is charged with tension.}

<P>__{(of the driver)}
<D>__{he's driving too fast.}
<A>__{stephan ignores her. she turns to the window, watches as they streak past another car.}
<C>__{rachel }
<D>__{this is ridiculous. what's so important? tell me where we're going?}

<C>__{stephan}
<D>__{a little of both. what did he want?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<C>__{stephan}
<D>__{what did he tell you?}
<A>__{something about his intensity unnerves her.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{he didn't tell me anything. (off his look) he didn't! he told me where he'd been travelling, that he'd been teaching... we spoke for a few minutes and then i had to go.}
<A>__{stephan is still staring at her, reading her.}
<C>__{rachel }
<P>__{(bristling)}
<D>__{if you don't believe me ask him yourself.}
<A>__{and then he can't keep it from his face and she knows. something terrible has happened.}
