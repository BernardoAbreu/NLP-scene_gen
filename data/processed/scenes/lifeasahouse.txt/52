<A>__{sam's curled up in a tattered lazy boy near the toilet, watching television as george sits on the bed, brushing his teeth. suddenly, sam turns to face his dad.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm not taking a dump with you in here.}
<A>__{george nods as he continues brushing.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{my brothers say it's the worst smell they've ever smelled.}
<A>__{george nods again, which appears only to irritate sam.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{i think you have to have a door between where you cook and where you crap. like even in the bush, tribal people and like that have a place for both. it's like a law.}
<A>__{george walks around sam to the sink and spits, rinses and wipes his mouth with a towel. he faces sam.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{which side of the bed do you want?}
<A>__{sam's jaw drops as he glances at the double bed.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{just kidding. the sofa's a pullout.}
<A>__{george smiles and pats sam on the shoulder before walking to the sofa and pulling it out to make a bed.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{probably in the bible.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{goodnight.}
<A>__{george drops his pants and climbs into bed. he pulls the sheet up and fluffs the pillow before resting his head.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i have to take a dump.}
<A>__{george twists around in bed to face sam. after a beat, he tosses the sheet back, climbs out of bed, pulls back on his pants, slips on his shoes and walks out of the garage.}
