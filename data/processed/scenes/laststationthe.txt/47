<A>__{without looking up}
<C>__{tolstoy}

<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}

<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{laughing about what?}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{i don't want to ruin last night.}
<A>__{she sips her tea, goes back to her writing. a pause. he follows suit. after a moment...}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{laughing about the fact that you've developed a senile crush on a fat middle aged flatterer. your passion for chertkov has become a standing joke.}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{i have a great affection for vladimir grigorivich. let them laugh if they find it amusing.}

<D>__{you have nothing in common. you are a genius. he's a sycophant and a pervert.}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{because he understands what i'm trying to do? because he tries to help me accomplish it?}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{he is using you. you just can't seem to see it.}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{this is absolute nonsense.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{that bold, obese, idiotic man. you treat him...}
<A>__{he turns to her...his face red with anger and frustration.}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{it's impossible for you not to distract me. let me alone... for god's sake. you're like a spoiled child.}
<A>__{he rises, spits on the ground, goes into the house. sofya follows.}
