<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior tea room washington, d.c. afternoon}
<A>__{a harp playing in an elegant tea room. the hushed tones of polite conversation wafts through the air. franklin sits with his cousin, alice roosevelt, 36, daughter of teddy. brilliant and acerbic, she would have had a career in politics had she been born a man.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{of course you lost. a roosevelt on the democratic ticket? our ancestors are turning in their graves.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{cousin alice, if teddy were alive he'd be a democrat and you know it.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{rubbish. but i do know one thing: you're exactly like him. my father was born wanting only one thing: to be president.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{and what's wrong with that?}
<A>__{they both share a laugh.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{do you know what they're saying about you?}
<A>__{franklin's smile fades.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{no, but i'm sure you'll tell me.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{they say f.d.r. stands for "featherduster." that you're a lightweight. a dilettante with no substance; no point of view.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{is that what you think?}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{you lead with your vanity. you talk when you should listen. unless these are the qualities of a democrat?}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{the democratic party is the party of the people. i am a man of the people.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{darling, you're a roosevelt. what do you know about people?}
<A>__{she leans in conspiratorially.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{of course, i can think of one person you did manage to find the time to invest in. a miss mercer, i believe?}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{alice, stop.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{don't misunderstand me, franklin. being married to eleanor i think you deserved some fun. but you made the right decision. especially since miss mercer has gone on with her life.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{edward rutherford is a wonderful catch for a girl like her.}
<C>__{franklin}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{she's married?}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{last week. a small event, of course.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{when i last heard she was governess to his children.}
<C>__{alice}
<P>__{(with a smile)}
<D>__{and then love bloomed. as a "man of the people," i wouldn't be too hard on her, franklin. we can't all have trust funds you know.}
