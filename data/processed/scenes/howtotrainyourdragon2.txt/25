<L>__{exterior windswept cliff later}
<A>__{valka and hiccup rise on their dragons, carried skyward by a strong coastal wind that thrusts vertical up shoreline cliff. one by one, dragons leap from the cliff and catch the strong updraft, popping their wings open like kites. they ride the wind and orbit around each other in a colorful, mesmeric dance. it's clearly a form of dragon play. hiccup, lifted off of his saddle by the force of the wind, laughs giddily as he watches valka walk across cloudjumper's wing and onto several others, dragon hopping from one to another, until she gracefully crosses toothless from wing tip to wing tip. she then drops out of sight, reappearing a moment later standing atop cloudjumper. hiccup is in utter awe of her. valka breathes in the frigid air. lets it out blissfully.}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{when i'm up here, i don't even feel the cold. i just feel...}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{free.}
<A>__{she smiles at hiccup. he gleams back.}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{this is what it is to be a dragon, hiccup.}
<A>__{hiccup locks the pedals in the flared tail position and unbuckles himself. valka watches, curious.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{it's all well and good to call yourself a dragon.}
<A>__{hiccup runs off of toothless, pulling his stowed wings.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{but can you fly?}
<A>__{they catch the air, snapping open... and sending him gliding. valka gasps, astonished. she flies her dragon alongside him, marvelling, as... ... hiccup soars, riding the wild air currents like an eagle, the image of freedom. toothless descends steadily with him, hovering protectively. hiccup grins, pleased at having impressed valka... until he realizes that he is once again racing toward a collision with a fast approaching mountain top.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{oh no. toothless!}
<A>__{but, with his tail locked, toothless can't make the tight jackknife turn skyward to rescue hiccup. realizing that they're in trouble, valka and cloudjumper pour on the speed. all four of them collide just as they reach the mountain top, sending them crash landing in an explosion of snow. they all topple head over tail to a messy landing on the wind swept ridge and pop up laughing.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{man! almost! we just about had it that time!}
<A>__{toothless raises his snow packed face, glowering. he tail swipes hiccup off of his feet and back into the powder. valka inspects hiccup's wing suit with utter fascination.}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{incredible.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{well, not bad yourself.}
<A>__{she caresses his cheek, staring deep into his eyes. hiccup doesn't recoil this time.}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{all this time, you took after me. and where was i?}
<P>__{(remorseful)}
<D>__{i'm so sorry, hiccup. can we start over? will you give me another chance?}
<A>__{hiccup smiles, a simple acknowledgement that all is forgiven.}
<C>__{valka }
<D>__{i can teach you all i've learned, these past twenty years. like...}
<A>__{valka finds a spot at the top of toothless' neck and rubs in a circular pattern. in response, his dorsal blades slowly crack, split and extend, forming a pronounced, aerodynamic `v' down the length of his back and tail.}
<C>__{valka }
<D>__{now you can make those tight turns.}
<A>__{toothless shudders, as if experiencing a much needed chiropractic adjustment. he bounds over to hiccup, giddily retracting and splaying his dorsal blades like a kid with a new toy.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{did you know about this?}
<A>__{valka smiles, delighting in their mutual amazement.}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{every dragon has its secrets.}
<A>__{toothless pounces around, showing off to cloudjumper, who seems thoroughly unimpressed.}
<C>__{valka }
<D>__{and i will show them all to you. we'll unlock every mystery, find every last species, together, as mother and son.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{this gift we share, hiccup... it bonds us. this is who you are, son. who we are. we will change the world for all dragons! we will make it a better, safer place!}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{that sounds... amazing.}
<A>__{she pulls him into a hug forceful, bursting with emotion. hiccup hugs valka back. they share a cathartic moment, before hiccup peels away from her.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{this is so great! now you and i can go talk to drago together!}
<A>__{she chuckles, incredulous.}
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{what? there's no talking to drago.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{but we have to }
<C>__{valka}
<D>__{ no. we must protect our own.}
<A>__{hiccup stares, exasperated by the familiar line. cloudjumper lumbers over, eager to be rid of toothless' puppy like energy. valka pets him.}
<C>__{valka }
<D>__{now come on, we should be getting back.}
<A>__{before hiccup can say anymore, he hear heavy breathing next to him, and looks over to see toothless with a gaping grin, clapping his dorsal blades.}
