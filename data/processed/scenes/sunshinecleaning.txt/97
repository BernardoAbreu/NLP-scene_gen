<A>__{norah looks around the room furnished modestly with a mixture of antiques and things that are simply old. yellow sticky notes cling to doors, walls, light switches, etc. each note contains a simple instruction such as `turn off light' or `watch news at 6:00'. norah walks past family photos that line the hall.}

<A>__{norah enters the red splattered room. a walker lies on its side next to a blood soaked rug. golden sunlight pours through the windows. a yellow square sticks to a picture frame on the coffee table. the frame holds the image of a smiling young couple in a different era. the note reads `edna plays bridge at 4:00'. norah slips a tyvec jumper on and looks out the window. a car pull up to the curb. norah stops and watches her sister walk mrs. davis to the car before starting her work.}
