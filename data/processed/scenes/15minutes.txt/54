<C>__{hawkins }
<D>__{good evening. welcome to "top story". tonight, i present to you material of a graphic and violent nature never before seen on television. and i do so with a heavy heart. you will be first hand witness to the slaying of celebrated new york city homicide detective, eddie flemming. it would be only normal to ask, why? why are we showing something so journalist, i must show it. a democracy survives through the freedom of its media, and if we cannot see what is happening then we don't deserve our democracy, or our freedom. eddie flemming was my friend. i cried when i watched this footage and vowed to fight this violence with every molecule of my being from this day onward. hopefully, this will have a similar effect on you. one final word, this material is absolutely not appropriate for children.}
