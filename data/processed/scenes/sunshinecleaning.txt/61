<C>__{rose}
<D>__{property easements, square footage, appliances...}

<C>__{rose}
<D>__{curb appeal.}
<A>__{mac growls and pounces on rose. it's fun and light. rose laughs while mac makes a show of mauling her neck. he falls on the bed and reaches out. rose takes his hand. it's rough against hers. there's a circular indentation where his wedding ring isn't. rose stops laughing. she touches the invisible ring.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{why'd you pick her?}
<A>__{mac looks up. buzz kill. the residue of a smile fades.}

<C>__{mac}
<D>__{if this is going to get all heavy }
