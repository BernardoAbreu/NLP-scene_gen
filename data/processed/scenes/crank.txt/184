<L>__{int humvee limousine, day}
<A>__{ricky verona and his crew are in the back, watching a noisy satellite feed on dual plasma tv screens. a japanese girl in a red blazer, one of the tourists from the bus, is being interviewed in japanese amidst a crowd of her semi identical friends. a translation is overdubbed.}
<C>__{japanese girl}
<D>__{<he was really giving it to her, right there on the vending machine.>}
<A>__{the girls giggle.}
<P>__{japanese girl (cont’d)}
<D>__{<he was very cute ...>}
<A>__{verona rolls his eyes.}
<C>__{verona}
<D>__{give me a fucking break...}
<A>__{the broadcast cuts to a montage: the trashed restaurant, the burning police motorcycle, the car crashed into the mall escalator, police sifting through wreckage, finally the sketch of chev’s face. announcer (v.o.)}
<D>__{and so the wild rampage that began at 9 am this morning in west los angeles continues, with the mysterious suspect still at large.}
<C>__{hood}
<D>__{maybe we shoulda give him more of that chinese shit.}
<C>__{verona}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{oh ... you think? jesus ...}
<A>__{his cell phone rings. he checks it.}
<P>__{verona (cont’d) (shaking his head in disbelief)}

<C>__{verona}
<D>__{a deal? you’re mental, dude.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{i want the antidote.}
<C>__{verona}
<D>__{oh, the antidote, huh?}
<A>__{verona makes eye contact with his crew, covering the mouthpiece of the phone; they all try to keep from breaking up.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{that’s right.}
<C>__{verona}
<D>__{and what are you prepared to give me. asshole.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{how about the jewelry i got off your faggot brother, you cocksucker?}
<A>__{this stings verona. he pulls the phone away from his face, looks at it like he wants to smash it into bits, then pulls himself together and puts it back to his ear.}
<C>__{verona}
<P>__{(holding back, tight lipped)}
<D>__{hmmm.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{thinking about it?}
<A>__{verona pantomimes jacking off for the boys.}

<C>__{chev}
<D>__{don’t be late, or i’ll trade this thing to some whore for a hand job ...}
<C>__{verona}
<P>__{(cutting him off)}
<D>__{i’ll be there.}
<A>__{he clicks off, then sits there, seething.}
<P>__{verona (cont’d) (to the boyz)}
<D>__{what the hell are you looking at?}
<A>__{they turn back toward the plasma screens. verona takes a deep breath, then speed dials a number on the cell phone.}
<P>__{verona (cont’d)}
<D>__{verona. you’re not going to believe the call i just got.}
