<L>__{interior abandoned metro city library night}
<A>__{master mind and the boys prepare the fortress for hal's revenge attack. master mind is as giddy as a schoolboy.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{alright, people, we don't have much time. titan should be here any minute, so let's get the lead out.}
<A>__{there is a giant mounted death ray in the middle of the hall being tinkered with by da vinci.}
<C>__{master mind }
<D>__{how's the death ray coming?}
<C>__{da vinci}
<D>__{nearly up to full power, sir.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{hum. let's turn it down a few notches. it's his first time and we don't want to get in a lucky shot, now do we?}
<A>__{plato enters the room.}
<C>__{master mind }
<D>__{anything on the radar yet?}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{not yet, sir.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{i see. well, he must be planning something big. are the flame androids deployed?}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{all twelve.}
<A>__{master mind rubs his hands in anticipation as he sits down on his throne.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{wonderful, wonderful. plato, da vinci, take your places next to me.}
<A>__{they move to either side of the chair.}
<C>__{master mind }
<D>__{no slouching.}
<A>__{da vinci straightens up and sucks in his gut. they remain this way for several long moments. master mind occasionally glances at a digital clock on the wall. still no titan.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{apparently quite some time has passed. the bold stances have degraded to fatigue.}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{he's certainly taking his time.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{he'll be here. that's the way it works.}
<B>__{still later}
<A>__{master mind reclines in his chair and taps his metal gauntlet impatiently on the armrest. plato has squatted down, resting his chin on his hand.}
<C>__{master mind }
<D>__{unprofessional, that's what this is. no, it's disrespect for the craft.}
<A>__{master mind rises and begins to pace back and forth.}
<C>__{master mind }
<D>__{would uberman have kept us waiting like this? of course not. he was a pro who knew the score. it's time we spelled out a few things for this titan. i will not be made a fool of.}
<A>__{he storms out of the room.}
