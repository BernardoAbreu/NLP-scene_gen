<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior whistler's workshop night}
<A>__{whistler studies karen, exhaling another lungful of smoke.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{blade's unique, you know. a one in a billion anomaly. he can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. but he still has the thirst.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what happens if he doesn't take the serum?}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{the thirst overcomes him, just like the others. it's not something he can control.}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{the problem is, time's running out. his body's starting to reject the serum. and so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{no offense, whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. you might have missed something.}
<C>__{whistler}
<P>__{(pointedly)}
<D>__{which is why you're here. we could use someone with your experience.}
<A>__{a beat passes between them and karen knows where she stands now. in for a penny, in for a pound. whistler reaches for blade's sword.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{this used to be mine, you know. it's been passed down through the centuries, from one hunter to the next }
<A>__{whistler extends the sword, sighting down the length of it. he takes a few practice parries it's obvious he used to be quite skilled in the art of swordsmanship.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{why do you hunt them?}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{habit, mostly, just like this.}
<A>__{whistler gestures with his cigarette. he finally stubs it out, his wistful reverie vanishing like so much smoke.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{i had a family once a wife, three daughters. then a drifter named deacon frost came calling one evening }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{he killed them?}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{eventually. he toyed with them first. he made me choose, do you understand? which order they would die in }
<A>__{karen stares at whistler, horrified.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{how did you escape?}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{i didn't. he was cruel enough to let me live.}
<P>__{(slapping his brace)}
<D>__{even gave me a souvenir to remember him by.}
<A>__{karen nods it's all falling into place for her now.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{and now you're using blade to exact your revenge?}
<C>__{whistler}
<P>__{(pointedly)}
<D>__{frost's bodycount keeps rising, and i'm not getting any younger, am i?}
<A>__{just then, we hear a scream come from blade's room, sounding more like the cry of a beast than a man. karen takes a step towards blade's room }
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{i wouldn't go in there if i were you. it's best to leave him alone when he's like this.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i will take my chances.}
