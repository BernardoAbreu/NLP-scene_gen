<L>__{interior burnell home day}
<A>__{inside the house. the interior of the house is dark and somewhat tawdry. the burnell's are almost poor. but sam then leads nicole into the special room he has built for her. it seems like another world. every detail has been lovingly attended to. no expense has been spared to make this room as attractive and inviting as possible. a room that a guilty, abusive father might dream up for his crippled daughter.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<A>__{pause. nicole wheels around, trying to control her emotions as she inspects the room. a phone rings in the background. mary goes to answer it. nicole fixes her gaze at the back of the door.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{the door needs a lock.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(taken aback)}
<D>__{sure. i will fix it right away.}
<A>__{sam goes to get his tools. jenny stares at nicole.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{can i come and visit you here?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{you better. and you can sleep in my new bed with me too.}
<A>__{nicole grabs her sister's hand, and jenny moves in close to her. sam comes back with the tools. he starts to screw in the hook.}
<C>__{nicole }
<D>__{that's too high. i will never reach it.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(nervous)}
<D>__{oh. i better get some spackle.}
<A>__{sam leaves again.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{mommy says you need to lock the boys out.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{what boys?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{nicole stares at jenny, as mary comes back into the room.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{so do you like your new room?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{it's interesting.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{your dad spent all his spare time in here. he wanted to make it absolutely perfect.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{i feel like a princess.}
<A>__{sam comes back and begins to work on the door. nicole watches him. she notices a new computer on a desk.}
<C>__{nicole }
<D>__{is this mine?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{yes. it's a present.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{from you?}

<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{you and mom have a lawyer?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{well, yes. he's your lawyer too.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{my lawyer? why do i need a lawyer?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home. aren't you hungry, honey? want me to fix you something?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{no. what's this lawyer business?}
<A>__{mary turns to jenny.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{jenny, why don't you go and play outside?}
<A>__{jenny looks at nicole.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{he's given me some stuff too. toys, and some books...}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{jenny.}
<A>__{jenny turns to leave. when she's outside, mary continues.}
<C>__{mary }
<D>__{he's a very kind man. and he knew that you'd need a computer for doing schoolwork.}
