<L>__{interior room}
<A>__{sigfried coughs, sending a chill up ted's spine. ted whips around to discover sigfried leaning up against the door to the bathroom.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{i was just beginning to think i could trust you, theodore. silly me.}
<A>__{ted's fingers are frozen over angela's lips.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i was just trying to help her breathe a little.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{don't let me stop you, teddy. you don't mind me calling you teddy, do you?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{that's fine.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{i used to have a little bunny rabbit named teddy, it looked real cute nibbling on angela's ear. only problem here is you're no bunny rabbit, theodore, and it really fuckin' razzes me to picture you doin' it. but don't let me stop you, teddy... no need to play sneaky poo.}
<A>__{ted starts to back toward the door.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{look, man, if this is some kind of voodoo thing and you want me to have sex with your wife, there is absolutely no way.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<P>__{(shouts at the top of his lungs)}
<D>__{i said, nibble, asshole! now!}
<A>__{the directness of sigfried's command, coupled with the sound of a trigger being cocked, forces ted to approach angela. angela is a stunning beauty, and ted being kind of a shy guy makes for an awkward situation. ted leans forward. as he closes in, angela's eyes close.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{sorry, lady.}
<A>__{ted pulls up short of actually nibbling on angela.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{what's the matter, no whiz left in the cheese? i'm not cramping your style, am i?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{look, i'm not playing this game anymore.}
<A>__{sigfried yanks ted backwards. he wraps his arms around him.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{it's almost all over, theodore, and soon you can go home to mommy.}
<A>__{ted struggles to free himself from sigfried's powerful bear hug and blasts out the following monologue.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{my name is not theodore, it's ted, ted, ted, t... e... d... ted... not teddy, not theodore... ted... yes, my mother did me the service of naming me theodore and i haven't a clue as to how you know that because everyone who knows that lives a long way away from here. do you have any idea what it's like to go to school where all the other kids' parents are in jail doing time for crimes like grand larceny, aggravated assault, burglary and murder, and you get stuck with a mother who names you theodore and dressed you up in little matching pink outfits with, get this, a little blue bow fucking tie! well, i will tell you what happens. pretty soon theodore becomes "theo the thumper," and when theo the thumper gets old enough, he packs his bags and goes thousands of miles away where he can put the whole bloody mess behind him. so, if you don't mind, shoot me now, because no one is going to call me that again. my name is ted, okay? got it? ted!}
<A>__{sigfried has followed the entire tirade in stunned silence. he takes a step toward ted and offers him his hand.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{sigfried.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{my name is sigfried.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{sigfried?}
<A>__{sigfried cuts a "something wrong with that?" look at ted.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{yah, sigfried.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{nice to meet you, sigfried.}
<A>__{ted cautiously takes sigfried's hand.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{very impressive, ted. "theo the thumper?"... ouch. it's a deal, kid. ted it will be.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{sigfried holds onto ted's hand. the soft sound of distant fireworks pops in the background. car horns and a muffled countdown signal that it's new year's. sigfried moves uncomfortably close to ted and from out of nowhere bolts forward, planting a wet kiss right on ted's mouth. something snaps in sigfried. he is either really getting off on this or he is caught in the grips of a seizure. he doubles back on the floors. ted and angela watch as he flops around like a flounder with the cocked gun waving all over the place. ted wipes his mouth with his jacket sleeve while trying to dodge the barrel of the gun.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you okay, mister? i will get help!}
<A>__{sigfried manages to steady the gun and point it directly at ted. he signals for ted to go to the bathroom.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{that's the wrong door, sir.}
<A>__{sigfried grabs ted by the leg and shove the barrel of the gun into his crotch. sigfried pulls ted's face closer to his.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{get me the nitro... it's in the bathroom cabinet. now!}
<A>__{ted rushes into the bathroom, leaving sigfried a babbling mess behind.}
