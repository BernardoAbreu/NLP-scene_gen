<A>__{a slide projector does its stuff on a sheet of card pinned to the door. close up of the hand and off screen voice of berlin. "notice anything weird about it?" the answer from ross is "no." a pen moves into frame and berlin points to marks on the hand.}

<D>__{so tell me about "jennifer?"}
<A>__{reaches for a pack of cigarettes and perches on a nearby stool.}
