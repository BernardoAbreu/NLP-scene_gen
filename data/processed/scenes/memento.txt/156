<A>__{leonard lies on the bed, in jeans, topless. he reaches for the ringing phone with his left arm. as his hand reaches the receiver leonard reads the tattoo on his arm which says: "never answer the phone" leonard strokes the tattoo as he lets the phone ring. it stops. leonard goes to the door, opens it and checks the number of the room: 21. he goes back to the phone, makes a call.}
