<A>__{brown walks stiffly into the room and stops. ponsonby waits by the door.}
<C>__{ponsonby }
<D>__{mr brown, ma'am.}
<A>__{victoria is bent over the desk, working at one of her numerous red boxes. she scribbles furiously at a letter, underlining and accenting words as she goes. finally, lady ely steps up to her side and whispers something in her ear. she carries on working. brown has time to survey the room. dominating everything are the same black wreathed busts and portraits of prince albert glimpsed in the corridor. finally, victoria nods and lady ely beckons brown forward. he steps up in front of the desk and waits. victoria looks up and brown bows deeply. silence. she stares at him for a long moment without apparently registering who he is. he towers over her, in bright tartan, while she sits hunched in her seat, all in black and knotted with tension. finally, she finds her voice. she sounds nervous and edgy.}

<C>__{brown}
<D>__{she's well, too.}
<A>__{victoria blinks at the sight of him. his presence is bringing him back. a beat.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{your family sent cards. it was much appreciated.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{i'm glad of it.}
<A>__{in an effort to control her emotions, victoria now sounds the same severe note as at lunch. but brown, unlike others, seems unaffected.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{my husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you. he would have approved, i am sure, of my calling on you in this way.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i trust it does not inconvenience you too much.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{i've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you have a brother in service here, do you not?}

<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that will be company for you.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{yes, ma'am.}
<A>__{silence. victoria starts to tire. she takes a sip of water and spills a little on herself. flustered, she searches for a hanky but cannot find one. lady ely hurries up with one of her own and the queen dabs it off. brown watches all of this with genuine concern. when victoria finally looks up, he stares at her in deep sympathy.}
<C>__{brown }
<D>__{honest to god, i never thought to see you in such a state. you must miss him dreadfully.}
<A>__{victoria stares back in stunned silence. ponsonby coughs involuntarily. lady ely freezes. a beat.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{you do not he ... get him out.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{get him out. get him out!}
<A>__{suddenly, brown finds himself tugged backwards out of the room. lady ely rushes up to assist as victoria shouts herself into a fit of uncontrolled sobbing.}
