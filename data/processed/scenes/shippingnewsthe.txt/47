<A>__{daycare in progress. the comfy parlor has been given over to the kids. a wall of polaroids of each child faces a map of newfoundland with drawings of moose, caribou, and lobster. little herry sits alone in a doorway, watching with big eyes as... ...quoyle, bunny astride his back, rampages around the parlor on all fours, snorting like a crazed boar. the kids are squealing, delighted, making excited little runs at him, swatting him with throw pillows and rolled up sweaters. thrill of the hunt. wavey comes through the doorway, drying her hands, just behind where her boy sits. quoyle doesn't see her, he's thrashing and bellowing, lost in the game. she watches, for a long beat. then leans down to herry.}
