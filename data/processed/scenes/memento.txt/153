<A>__{leonard grabs his polaroids and finds one of natalie. he reaches into his pocket for a pen, but cannot find one.}
<C>__{natalie }
<D>__{lost your pen? that's too bad, freak. otherwise you could've written yourself a little note about how much natalie hates your retarded guts.}
<A>__{leonard moves around the room searching for a pen. natalie follows him, speaking into his ear.}
<C>__{natalie }
<D>__{no pens here, i'm afraid. you're never going to know that i called you a retard, and your wife a whore.}
<A>__{leonard turns to face her, barely controlling his anger.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{don't say another fucking word!}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{about your whore of a wife?}
<A>__{leonard slaps natalie. she smiles, then speaks softly.}
<C>__{natalie }
<D>__{i read about your problem. you know what one of the causes of short term memory loss is?}
<A>__{leonard fumes.}
<C>__{natalie }
<D>__{venereal disease. maybe your cunt of a wife sucked one too many diseased cocks and turned you into a retard.}
<A>__{leonard turns away, body tensed, ready to snap. natalie reaches out to gently brush the hair above his ear with her fingers.}
<C>__{natalie }
<D>__{you sad freak, you won't remember any of what i've said, and we'll be best friends, or even lovers.}
<A>__{leonard spins around, backhanding natalie on the cheek. he punches her in the mouth then pushes her to the floor. he stands over her, furious with himself as much as her. natalie gets to her feet, and goes to the door. she turns to leonard. her face is bloody but she smiles.}
<C>__{natalie }
<D>__{see you soon.}
<A>__{natalie exits. leonard watches her walk out to her car and get in. she just sits there. leonard turns from the window and looks around the room. he grabs at drawers, searching for a pen. he looks back out the window. natalie is still sitting in her car. leonard is sifting through the papers on the desk when he hears a car door slam. he looks out of the window to see natalie getting out of her car. she turns to walk toward the house. her face is swollen and bloody. leonard opens the door for her.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{what happened?}
<A>__{natalie, intensely agitated, fumbles with things in her purse.}
