<L>__{interior classroom day}
<A>__{assembled in a semi circle, a handful of well dressed christian kids open their meeting of the cross your heart club with prayer. marianne, of course, leads them in this ritual. nina is also present.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{heavenly father, watch over us with your all encompassing love. keep us on the path toward your righteousness and eternal salvation.}
<A>__{they all smile, say `amen' and open their eyes.}
<C>__{marianne }
<D>__{guys. we have a problem.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{amen to that.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{olive penderghast. we need to pray for her, but we also need to get rid of her. i'm sure, by now, you've all heard about what happened at melanie bostic's party. christian kid #1 i was there. i heard the whole thing.}
<A>__{marianne eyes him, suspiciously.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{that's not something you need to advertise, kurt.}
<C>__{kurt}
<P>__{(sheepishly)}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{see, herein lies the problem: she's doing these tasteless, immoral acts in plain view of the entire student body.}
<C>__{marianne }
<D>__{she's in direct opposition to everything we're trying to do for this school, which is make it a wholesome learning environment and a place where our children will one day flourish the way that we are.}
<P>__{(beat.)}
<D>__{she was sent to the principal's office last week }
<C>__{nina}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{she called me a really hurtful name.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{ and i tried to witness to her, but she's defiant to any sort of help.}
<A>__{she tears up.}
<C>__{marianne }
<D>__{i don't know what to do, but something's got to be done.}
<A>__{her boyfriend, micah (17) takes her hand and holds it. she leans against his shoulder, wiping away tears. nina, on the other side of her, begins rubbing her shoulder, sympathetically.}
<C>__{marianne }
<D>__{does anybody here think that they can talk to her in a way that might get her to see that what she's doing is wrong?}
<A>__{she suddenly bursts into sobs. (and these aren't crocodile tears. she is flooded with emotion.)}
<C>__{marianne }
<D>__{i'm sorry. this is so stupid.}
<C>__{micah}
<D>__{no, it's not, marianne.}
<A>__{she wipes her tears away.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{jesus tells us to love everyone. even the whores and the homosexuals, but it's so hard.}
<C>__{marianne }
<D>__{it's so hard, because they just keep doing `it' over and over again.}
<A>__{she takes micah and nina's hands, the rest of the group follows suit.}
<C>__{marianne }
<D>__{make me a promise. make god a promise right here and now that we will remain pure and chaste until marriage.}
<P>__{(looking to micah)}
<D>__{until our love is proven holy in his eyes.}
<C>__{all}
<D>__{we promise.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{let's continue to pray for olive penderghast. that either she sees that what she's doing is a sin and changes her behavior or that she gets the hell out of our school.}
<A>__{they all squeeze hands and marianne manages a smile.}
<C>__{marianne }
<D>__{awww, i love you guys. god loves you guys.}
