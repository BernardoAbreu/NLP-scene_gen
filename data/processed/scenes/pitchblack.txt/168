<L>__{exterior night}
<A>__{they trundle on, fry the new tail gunner. at side guard, paris relaxes a bit even though the clicking never seems far from earshot. a weak fireball spews from his torch. he checks the reservoir. almost empty.}
<C>__{paris}
<D>__{light, please, need light here....}
<A>__{still moving, johns and imam train lights on paris while he refuels. for a brief moment, audrey strays from the light. predator's pov: dive bombing the girl. a high velocity clicking: it's like an incoming missile. imam lunges at the last nanosecond... and flattens audrey to the ground. scythe blades swing... chinking the harness chains on imam's back . johns whirls, blasts. light beams leap around. but the predator is long gone.}

<P>__{(trembling)}
<D>__{please...have we been cut? can someone tell me if....}
<A>__{he finds his dropped light, thumbs the switch again and again. broken. in the confusion, paris has been left in the dark. something slashes him from behind . it's like the night has claws.}
<C>__{paris}
<D>__{oh, sweet jesus....}
<A>__{the bottle drops. the blood flows. the clicking stops.}
<C>__{paris}
<D>__{oh, sweet jesus, will you get me some light over here!}
<A>__{faces whip around. but before their lights can rescue him... paris is gone , snatched away by a swooping blur. light beams jump fitfully, vainly. riddick's pov: of predators feasting on paris. carrying a youngling on its back, a female predator arrives late and can't find a place at the trough. with shocking apathy, it whips the youngling off its back and begins devouring it. other predators start in fighting, killing themselves for food. pov pans to a pair of predators, closer, sounding out new prey. pov pans again to include the object of their desire. audrey . close on riddick. trying to figure it out. close on audrey. listening to the horrific feeding sounds. oblivious to all the attention she's getting.}
