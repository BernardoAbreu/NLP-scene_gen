<C>__{brody}
<P>__{(preoccupied)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{peterson}
<D>__{is jeff hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim chief of police in your absence?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{temporarily? uh... sure... the question's out of left field. why are they asking?}
<C>__{nichols}
<D>__{so jeff could handle things? he knows the routine, he has the authority?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{yeah. why?}
<C>__{peterson}

<C>__{kaiser}
<D>__{seaweed?}
<C>__{nichols}

<A>__{he snatches up the photo.}
<B>__{insert photo}
<A>__{just as before, an ambiguous pattern of light and dark; not proof of anything without brody's inner vision.}
<C>__{vaughn }
<D>__{it's nothing i can see.}
<B>__{angle on brody}
<A>__{waving the picture.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{what are you all, blind? it's a shark. look teeth, jaw, gills.}
<C>__{peterson}
<D>__{is that what it is?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{you're damn right that's what it is.}
<C>__{nichols}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i just don't see it.}
<A>__{sansom and kaiser agree, ad lib, "that's nothing..."}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{martin, it could be anything.}
<C>__{brody}
<P>__{(exploding)}
<D>__{what the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls? jesus, it's right there in front of you. i know what a goddamn shark looks like, i've been through it, don't you understand? i've seen this sonofabitch before!}
<A>__{the selectmen look at each other in the face of brody's agitation. tempers are running high.}
<C>__{peterson}
<D>__{what have you seen before? this is nothing. seaweed. mud. something in the lens.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{my ass!}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{be reasonable, please...}
<C>__{peterson}
<P>__{(to vaughn)}
<D>__{forget it, he won't listen.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{there is nothing to discuss.}
<C>__{peterson}
<P>__{(blowing up)}
<D>__{will you listen to this man? will you just listen to him?}
<P>__{(to brody)}
<D>__{you really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, god knows who could've been injured what if somebody decides to sue us? that could ruin us.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{is that what it is? dollars? money? i will pay for it. take it out of my salary.}
<C>__{peterson}
<D>__{you don't make enough.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{maybe i don't make as much money as some bullshit rip off artists around here, but i don't work the same way.}
<C>__{peterson}
<D>__{what's that supposed to mean?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{it means i don't like all that grab ass and heavy breathing with my wife, it means i know who's out to screw me here, and it means that i know something none of you know because i've been there and i don't want to go through that horror again. ever!}
<A>__{there's a long pause.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{martin, could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{go ahead, whatever it's worth.}
<A>__{the selectmen file into vaughn's office, leaving brody alone in the room. the last one in the door very carefully makes sure it's tightly shut. brody sits alone at the table.}
