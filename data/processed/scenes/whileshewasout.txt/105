<A>__{tomas catches up with della, chases her into the trees. behind him vinh hoists himself up over the ledge, then chuckie. della runs. faster than she's ever run before. practically flies through the trees. her breath comes hard. his too, just behind her. their footfalls crash into the foliage. it's dark, so dark. she's running blindly. and they're right behind her. tomas swipes at her. he just misses. he swipes again. a twisted shape looms ahead, almost blocks her path. she runs right up to it then darts left at the last moment, setting up thomas who's right behind her. tomas runs into the stump of a big old tree trunk, hits himself at groin level. he doubles over in pain.}

<A>__{della races on. thomas gathers himself together, picks up the chase. but that moment's delay has bought her some time. her adrenaline pumps hard. eyes darting for a hiding place among the dark shapes and planes of the woods.}
