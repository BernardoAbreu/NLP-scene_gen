<A>__{if you asked him he'd tell you that the gates to heaven are guarded by the u.s. marine corps.}
<C>__{kendrick}
<D>__{sir, santiago is a member of second platoon, delta.}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{yeah, well, apparently he's not very happy down here at shangri la, cause he's written letters to everyone but santa claus asking for a transfer. and now he's telling tales about a fenceline shooting.}
<A>__{he tosses the letter over to markinson. markinson is looking it over. jessep is waiting for a response.}
<C>__{jessep}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{matthew?}
<C>__{markinson}
<D>__{i'm appalled, sir.}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{you're appalled? this kid broke the chain of command and he ratted on a man of his unit, to say nothing of the fact that he's a u.s. marine and it would appear that he can't run from here to there without collapsing from heat exhaustion. what the fuck's going on over at windward, matthew?}
<C>__{markinson}
<D>__{colonel, i think perhaps it would be better to hold this discussion in private.}
<C>__{kendrick}
<D>__{that won't be necessary, colonel, i will handle the situation.}
<C>__{markinson}
<D>__{the same way you handled the curtis barnes incident? you're doing something wrong, lieutenant this }
<C>__{kendrick}
<D>__{my methods of leadership are }
<C>__{markinson}
<D>__{don't interrupt me, i'm still your superior officer.}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{and i'm yours, matthew.}
<A>__{the room calms down for a moment.}
<C>__{jessep}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i want to know what we're gonna do about this.}
<C>__{markinson}
<D>__{i think santiago should be transferred off the base. right away.}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{he's that bad, huh?}
<C>__{markinson}
<D>__{not only that, but word of this letter's bound to get out. the kid's gonna get his ass kicked.}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{transfer santiago. yes i suppose you're right. i suppose that's the thing to do. wait. wait. i've got a better idea. let's transfer the whole squad off the base. let's on second thought windward. the whole windward division, let's transfer 'em off the base. jon, go on out there and get those boys down off the fence, they're packing their bags.}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{tom!}
<A>__{the orderly cones in from the outer office.}
<C>__{orderly}
<D>__{sir!}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{got me the president on the phone, we're surrendering our position in cuba.}
<C>__{orderly}
<D>__{yes sir!}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{wait a minute, tom.}
<A>__{the orderly stops.}
<C>__{jessep}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{don't call the president just yet. maybe we should consider this for a second. maybe and i'm just spit balling here but maybe we as officers have a responsibility to train santiago. maybe we as officers have a responsibility to this country to see that the men and women charged with its security are trained professionals. yes. i'm certain i once read that somewhere. and now i'm thinking that your suggestion of transferring santiago, while expeditious, and certainly painless, might not be in a manner of speaking, the american way. santiago stays where he is. we're gonna train the lad. you're in charge, jon. santiago doesn't make 4.1 on his next fitness report, i'm gonna blame you. then i'm gonna kill you.}
<C>__{kendrick}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<C>__{markinson}
<D>__{i think that's a mistake, colonel.}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{matthew, i believe i will have that word in private with you now. jon, that's all. why don't you and i have lunch at the "o" club, we'll talk about the training of young william.}
<C>__{kendrick}
<D>__{yes sir, i'd be delighted to hear any suggestions you have.}
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{dismissed.}

<D>__{what do you think of kendrick?}
<C>__{markinson}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i don't know that }
<C>__{jessep}
<D>__{i think he's kind of a weasel, myself. but he's an awfully good officer, and in the end we see eye to eye on the best way to run a marine corps unit. we're in the business of saving lives, matthew. that's a responsibility we have to take pretty seriously. and i believe that taking a marine who's not yet up to the job and packing him off to another assignment, puts lives in danger.}

<D>__{we go back a while. we went to the academy together, we were commissioned together, we did our tours in vietnam together. but i've been promoted up through the chain with greater speed and success than you have. now if that's a source of tension or embarrassment for you, well, i don't give a shit. we're in the business of saving lives, captain markinson. don't ever question my orders in front of another officer.}
