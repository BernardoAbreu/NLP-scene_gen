<L>__{interior audrey and max's dining room night}
<A>__{we pan down from banners reading happy birthday, max!. . . to a room full of guests... to a desultory five year old. audrey finishes lighting the candles on the homemade cake.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{all right, birthday boy, make a wish.}
<A>__{max doesn't respond.}
<C>__{audrey }
<D>__{c'mon, honey. it can be anything whatever you want most in the world.}
<A>__{when he .doesn't respond, she leans down to him..}
<C>__{audrey }
<D>__{max, your dad is sorry. he had to work.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{he said he was coming. he promised.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{yes, well, he... promises he'll see you tomorrow.}
<A>__{max doesn't believe it. max (v.o.)}
<D>__{i wish, for just one day, dad couldn't tell a lie.}
<A>__{he takes a breath and blows out all the candles. a strange wind blows the drapes and the wisp of smoke up, up, up... to the clock on the wall. it's 9:15.}
