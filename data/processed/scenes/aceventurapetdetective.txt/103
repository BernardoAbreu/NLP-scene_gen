<L>__{interior tea room night}
<A>__{a full on thrash metal band is cranking on stage. kids leap wildly into the moshing pit. the same burnout is still thrashing his head wildly to the music.}
<C>__{ace}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{nice to see you again!}
<A>__{the burnout just keeps thrashing. ace spots woodstock watching the band and joins him.}
<C>__{woodstock}
<D>__{st. francis, how's it goin'?}
<C>__{ace}
<P>__{(kidding)}
<D>__{that's none of your damn business.}
<C>__{woodstock}
<D>__{isn't it?}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{is it?}
<C>__{woodstock}
<D>__{anything new on that dolphin?}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{got his picture on some tuna cans, but nothing so far.}
<A>__{a singer roars on stage. he sounds like a garbage disposal full of cutlery.}
<B>__{singer}
<A>__{arroohhghhh! myrrrooohghhhh! geroooghhh!}
<C>__{woodstock}
<D>__{so, what can i do for you today?}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{i need info on a football flunky named ray finkle.}
<C>__{woodstock}
<D>__{sorry, ace, i can't help you right now. i gotta watch this band! they are the shit!}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{are they?}
<C>__{woodstock}
<D>__{aren't they?}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{alright then. don't worry about it. i mean dolphins aren't exactly an endangered species. it's not like the whole food chain's gonna be affected if one highly intelligent mammal dies a slow and painful death! hell, if the band is loud enough, you won't even hear its pitiful whimpering!!}
<A>__{ace does his best suffering dolphin impression. woodstock is no longer enjoying the band.}
