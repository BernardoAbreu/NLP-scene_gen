<L>__{interior darla's apartment day (overcast)}
<A>__{a grey day but no rain. elly stands wistfully by the window, her doll on standby. the apartment is in order and perhaps we notice a few new items. gabriel the cat, miraculously alive, is sprawled on a chair, licking himself. darla bustles into frame b.g. her wardrobe more upscale, her hair done. her manner is hectic but natural.}

<D>__{worktime, kiddo. first day, new job, gotta go.}
<A>__{this does not get the expected smile from elly.}
<C>__{darla }
<D>__{you sure you're gonna be okay?}
<A>__{elly turns from the window and nods silently. elly's pov outside the aforementioned grey day in the city. angle darla and elly at the window. darla comes up. arm around elly. cheer up; he attitude much more connected and loving. push in on elly so we know she is clutching shelly's ring tightly in her hand. darla looks past elly, out the window.}
<C>__{darla}
<D>__{at least it finally stopped raining.}
<C>__{elly}
<D>__{it can't rain all the time.}
<A>__{darla kisses elly on the temple and it out the door. elly opens her hand to consider the ring. she looks back out the window angle the crow on the ledge elly is looking right at it. same crow. we're positive. so is elly. it takes wing and flies away.}
