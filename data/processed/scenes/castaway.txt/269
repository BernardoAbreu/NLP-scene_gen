<L>__{exterior memphis superhub moments later}
<A>__{the md 11 taxis up. as usual, the superhub is a frenzy of activity. a loading crew stands ready, forklifts poised. even this plane carries packages. phil steele, the chairman of fedex, leslie, becca, dick, and other executives wait on a special podium near the gangway. everyone looks different older, a mustache here, a thickening around the belly there. behind a barrier a cluster of cameras film the scene. the plane cuts its engine. the stairs are rolled out. forklifts and gangways move forward. cargo doors open. chuck appears in the door. he holds the fedex package and a small travel bag. chuck blinks against the lights and the glare. stan is right by him. everyone bursts into applause and cheering. after four years of total solitude this is completely overwhelming.}

<C>__{roger}
<D>__{glad you made it, big brother.}
<A>__{stan and chuck head for the podium. all the loaders and operators and package scanners begin to applaud. chuck smiles, then laughs, getting into the emotion. he keeps up an almost indecipherable babble underneath the cheering. occasionally he sees someone he knows.}
