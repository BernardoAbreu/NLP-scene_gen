<L>__{interior day. moor house the parlour.}
<A>__{jane is staring out at the autumn rain. she surreptitiously wipes her tears away and smiles up at mary.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{have you something for me to do?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you are doing something already. may i see?}
<A>__{jane hands her a book. she has drawn a bride.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{that's miss temple on her wedding day. she was my teacher; a great influence on me. under her guidance i became a teacher too.}
<A>__{mary turns the page. it shows a sketch of st john rivers. mary gasps in delight. she takes the book straight to st john, who is diligently working at his desk.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{st john }
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{no, mary, please }
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{see how skilled jane is.}
<A>__{st john looks at the sketch of himself. he is quite taken aback. he looks over at jane, who is quite embarrassed.}
<C>__{mary }
<D>__{she is better than any drawing master we have ever had.}
<A>__{for a moment, st john seems to be weighing up whether to be insulted or not.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{how fierce i am, miss elliott.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{mr rivers, i wondered if you had yet heard of any work that i could do.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{i found you a situation some days ago but i've delayed telling you because the work is lowly and i fear you'll scorn it.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i shan't mind what i do.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{as i am poor and obscure, the help i can offer is of the meanest sort.}
<C>__{diana}
<D>__{st john, what are you going to offer her? not washerwoman, i hope?}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{when i took over the parish two years ago it had no school. i opened one for boys; i now intend to open one for girls. the school mistress will have a two roomed cottage paid for by local benefactors and she will receive fifteen pounds a year. you can see how humble, how ignoble it is.}
<A>__{on the contrary, jane is deeply gratified.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{mr rivers, i thank you heartily and i accept with all my heart.}
<C>__{st john}
<D>__{but you comprehend me? it's a village school cottagers daughters. what will you do with all your fine accomplishments?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i will save them until they are wanted. they will keep.}
<A>__{jane smiles at him. st john is impressed.}
