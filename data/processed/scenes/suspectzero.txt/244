<L>__{interior mackelway's yukon driving night}
<A>__{a huge storm devours scenery on both sides of us. o'ryan drives. mackelway sits, no expression at all on his face, still recovering from what happened in that room... silence... then:}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{tell me about icarus.}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{just... wanna know.}
<A>__{o'ryan eyes him. the sky is black.}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{there were five of us. in the program.}
<A>__{mackelway's all ears...}
<C>__{o'ryan }
<D>__{we'd come in in the morning, have a cup of coffee, talk about the yankees. then you'd go to your room, with your pen and}
<C>__{o'ryan }
<D>__{your pad of paper, always alone, and you'd try to lock in. son of sam. john wayne gacy. ted bundy. he might be driving his car, or having a beer or brushing his teeth... or cutting someone's eyes out.}
<A>__{that was said flatly, matter of factly. it's chilling.}
<C>__{o'ryan }
<D>__{if you did it right, you got all of it: the way it sounded. the way it smelled... those people were looking up at you, begging you for mercy. it was like being god.}

<A>__{he pauses.}
<C>__{o'ryan }
<D>__{they wired us into this current, the five of us: darkness, the pit itself. we were plugged right into it. but nobody taught us how to shut it off...}
<P>__{(thinking back...)}
<D>__{we were just men. and we saw things men shouldn't see. agony, torture, evil and it never shut off. even now, it's still there.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{they all wind up like you? the other agents?}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{no. they're dead now.}
<A>__{oh. mackelway doesn't reply...}
<C>__{o'ryan }
<D>__{they broke down. then they opted out.}
<P>__{(mackelway's a blank)}
<D>__{killed themselves... after a while, those conversations about the yankees became impossible. ya see?}
<A>__{mackelway lets that sink in, as he stares at passing head lights. then:}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{o'ryan shrugs. he appreciates it. the windshield wipers beat back rain...}
