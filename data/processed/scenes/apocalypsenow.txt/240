<L>__{214 what they see}
<A>__{hundreds and hundreds of montagnard natives dressed in the most ornate and primitive manner: feathers, parts of birds and animals; cod pieces all in body and face paint of the most savage nature. but there is a purity about them, men and boys, standing passively watching the small navy craft flying the strange flag of red, white and blue.}
<L>__{215 view on the p.b.r.}
<A>__{the men of the crew are not the same men who began this voyage. their manner is lifeless as though in a trance. the various decorations and paraphenelia that they have picked up along the way seem oddly relevant to the savages that stand before them. the chef has made a hat of birdfeathers; lance's face has been painted with mud under the eyes to block the glare of the sun. he wears certain animal skins; trinkets; some animal teeth. their uniforms have been torn and patched throughout the difficult journey. they start to move to their gun positions.}
