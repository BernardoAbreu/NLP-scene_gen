<A>__{as bucky creeps through the house until he gets to a closed door. he opens it, entering fritzie's study he stumbles along the wall until he finds a standing gooseneck lamp and turns it on. the walls are covered with pictures of fritzie in uniform, dating back twenty five years. bucky bends down in front of the small mahogany desk and begins rifling through its file drawers. what he finds surprises him: carbons of official lapd intelligence reports, lists of account balances, financial dealings, payments made all cross referenced to each individual being investigated. a veritable how to primer on how to extort from criminals.. bucky digs deeper into the files and pulls out: issler's ad vice file complete with mug shots.}

<A>__{bucky scans the file, running his finger down the list of names, looking for something familiar. he stops at one: "sally stinson". beside her name a handwritten note: "biltmore hotel". he writes it down and moves to another list of names: "known associates, no prostitution record". and there it is: "betty short".}
