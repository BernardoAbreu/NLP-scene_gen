<L>__{interior "the hole" back hall night}
<A>__{a back hall dark, the furthest recesses of the building. madden continues cautiously toward... a door}
<L>__{interior the hole back room night}
<A>__{the door is cracked open. madden moving very quietly now, scowling as he peers through the slight opening. three guys and whirring machines counting stacks of money. guns on the tabletops, in holsters, out of reach. the door flies open.}
<C>__{madden}
<D>__{police!}
<A>__{a moment of panic as the guys bent over the machines freeze. raise their hands, slowly turn. then lower their hands.}
<C>__{erlich}
<D>__{you fuck. don't do that.}
<A>__{it's erlich, larkin and toomey. three cops we met at the execution. erlich's cane nearby.}
<C>__{madden}
<D>__{how's the month end?}
<C>__{erlich}
<D>__{oh yes. never been better.}
<C>__{madden}
<D>__{where's dutton?}
<C>__{erlich}
<D>__{probably parked near some high school with a hardon. fuck never showed.}
<C>__{madden}
<D>__{anyone at all curious why?}
<A>__{erlich, larkin and toomey exchange a look. madden goes to one of the money counters and grabs... a stack of twenties tossed violently at the ceiling. larkin and toomey scramble as the bills flutter down like leaves, picking them up.}
<C>__{madden }
<D>__{you leave the door open with two hundred strangers out there! what's it take for you guys to learn a goddamn lesson?}
<C>__{toomey}
<D>__{no one saw anything, mad.}
<C>__{madden}
<D>__{you know why dutton's not here? rigor mortis! he's dead.}
<A>__{the three exchange looks.}
<C>__{madden }
<D>__{one shot to the head, then fifty three stab wounds with a six inch blade. any deja vu here? think corvus knife, missing from the evidence room.}
<C>__{toomey}
<D>__{since when?}
<C>__{madden}
<D>__{since last night. as usual, you're right on top of things.}
<C>__{larkin}
<D>__{it was supposed to end when corvis died. remember? the kid no one would miss?}
<C>__{erlich}
<D>__{don't look at me, asshole.}
<C>__{larkin}
<D>__{hey, i didn't kill anybody.}
<C>__{erlich}
<D>__{back off. i mean it.}
<C>__{madden}
<D>__{shut up! erlich and larkin settle down.}
<C>__{madden }
<D>__{crime scene's a goddamn clusterfuck. every reporter in town's trying to get a look at dutton's body. i suggest we get a line on this before someone else does.}
<C>__{larkin}
<D>__{who'd give a shit about corvis at this point? kid didn't have a friend in the world even when he was alive.}
<C>__{erlich}
<D>__{i can think of one.}
<A>__{erlich and madden share a look. on the same wavelength. erlich picks up his weapon off the table.}
