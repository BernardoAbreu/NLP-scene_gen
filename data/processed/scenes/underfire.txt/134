<A>__{a cab takes them through the increasingly nervous city. la guardia troop trucks are everywhere things seem more hurried. a hunting rifle sits in the cabbie's lap. they get out and knock on jazy's door. guardia soldiers watch them from a distance, a development that price and claire are aware of.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i don't think it's jazy.}
<A>__{still no answer.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{oates said it was a frog. how many frenchmen you know around here? jazy ain't 'facilitating' shit.}
<A>__{price is impatient. he looks around nervously the guards are out of view and he slides a knife into the latch, jimmying the lock. the door opens slowly an alarm goes off. price and claire duck inside quickly.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{christ!}
<A>__{price, momentarily comfortable with the danger, responds quickly and finds the alarm wire running along the door jamb. la guardia troops nearby hear the alarm and head toward jazy's. inside the house price finds the alarm box which he pries open and expertly pulls two wires. the alarm stops. immediately they begin going through drawers and cupboards. she pulls out some harmless snapshots of miss panama, replaces them.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{are we looking for negs or prints?}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{anything.}
<A>__{they find nothing downstairs. the look up at the sound of distant gunfire. suddenly: loud banging at the front door la guardia.}
