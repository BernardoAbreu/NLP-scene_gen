<A>__{the multi harmonic whine of the hunter's ship is still building as the ground begins to shake. schaefer, realizing that the ship is going to explode, and ignoring the pain of his shoulder and leg, runs desperately, searching for cover. he sprints for the edge of the clearing, diving over the embankment just as: a blinding purple flash blows the ship to pieces.}
<L>__{exterior helicopter cockpit day}
<A>__{enveloped in the flash of intense light. cries of surprise fill the ship as the shock wave hits the chopper, heeling it hard over to one side. below, the concentric waves of energy race outward from the center of the blast, an unearthly sight, like the miniature birth of a star. the helicopter suddenly regains control, its power restored.}
