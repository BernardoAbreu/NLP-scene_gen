<L>__{interior andy's house living room late day}
<A>__{harry, joan and duke following, moves along the glass facade, inspecting, then assessing the security status of the house:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{well, i'd have to say this place is a snap to break into.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i knew it. i shouldn't have moved here.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{don't worry. the dog'll take care of anyone trying to get inside.}
<A>__{she moves down into the living room, crossing toward one of the couches, with harry following:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i don't know what to do. maybe i should move into a motel.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{no, you don't have to do that. this is just some ding dong that's trying to scare you.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{well he's succeeded.}
<A>__{she sits down.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{but you don't want to give off that impression, by acting too timid or afraid, because that's what invites an aggressive attitude from certain types of men.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i didn't invite this.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{for instance, don't go mincing along, taking mousey little steps, and waving your hanky, because you're drawing a target on yourself if you do...}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{do i do that?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{well, let's see. just walk back and forth the way you normally do.}
<C>__{joan}
<P>__{(stands up)}
<D>__{well i don't normally walk back and forth, but... okay.}
<A>__{she attempts a few steps then stops abruptly:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i can't do it with you watching me.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{okay, but keep in mind that you want to exhibit a very confident attitude. look like you know what you're doing and where you're going.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{uhm hmm.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{just remember to stop short of appearing a little dykey, because that's not attractive.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{but i thought that's your point, no to attract...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{no, no, you always want to remain a little bit attractive. otherwise that can set somone off too.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{this is just impossible.}
<A>__{she moves back to the couch and sits down.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{you just can't win.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{sure you can, it's just a matter of degree.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{well darn it, i give up...}
<A>__{dropping her head into her hands.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{uh oh.}
<P>__{(moves over to her}
<D>__{and touches her}
<P>__{gently)}
<D>__{now what's this?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i'm sorry but this is really getting to me.}
<A>__{he sits down next to her:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{tell you what. let me take you out of here, buy you a drink, and see if we can't get your mind off these kind of things.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{that's very sweet of you, harry. i'd like to do that.}
