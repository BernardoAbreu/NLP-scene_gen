<A>__{jack comes downstairs... finds dozens of space monkeys.}
<L>__{interior kitchen night}
<A>__{jack enters. space monkeys render fat and make soap. they pinch herbs, adding them to the mix. they add vodka. off to the side, a couple monkeys stir a vat of rice. on the wall is a big bulletin board with hundreds of driver's licenses; a sign above it: "human sacrifices."}
<C>__{freckled space monkey}
<D>__{"you are not a beautiful and unique snowflake. you are the same decaying organic matter as everything else. we are all part of the same compost heap."}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{planet tyler.}
<A>__{jack dips a spoon into the rice, chomps on it irritatingly.}
<C>__{freckled space monkey}
<D>__{"we are the all singing, all dancing crap of the world."}
<A>__{jack picks up a bottle of vodka.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{i had to hug the walls, trapped inside this clockwork of space monkeys, cooking and working and sleeping in teams.}
