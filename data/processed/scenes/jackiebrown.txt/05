<L>__{interior melanie's beahc apartment night}
<A>__{the black voice belong to forty five year old ordell}
<B>__{robbie.}
<A>__{ordell wears clothes nice and likes wearing nice clothes. stylish, athletic wear (reebok), heavy, black leather jackets (hugo boss), warm colored berets and baseball caps to cover his balding head are ordell's "look." at this moment ordell's wearing an open silk shirt. ordell narrates the video playing on the big screen v. (the most expensive thing in the apartment). he holds a cocktail in one hand (screwdriver, his drink of choice) and the remote control in the other, pacing the floor in his i can talk anybody into anything voice. louis gara, who looks like he does his shopping at the salvation army (dressed in a hawaiian shirt and dungarees), sits on the sofa staring blankly at the video, drinking jack daniels on ice. louis, white, also in his mid forties, has lived over half of his life in penal institutions. the experience has affected both his body language and his thought process. while acutely aware of the rhythm of life inside a correction facility, in the real world his timing is thrown. it's like a song he doesn't know the lyrics to but attempt to sing anyway. the third person watching the video is the person who lives in this apartment, melanie ralston. melanie, thirty three, is a tanned, blonde, california beach bunny. like the kind you se in the old crown international movies from the seventies like "pom pom girls" "malibu beach" and "beach girls," except melanie is older than any of those girls ever are. she's dressed in her melanie uniform of stringy levis cutoffs and a stringy bra top. so far melanie has been able to make a living out of lying in the sun, always finding a generous, wealthy man more than willing to pay her rent and pick up her tabs. in her prime (twenty two) it was japanese industrialists, film production guys, and middle eastern businessmen who kept melanie. and it was places like the bahamas, acapulco, and the virgin islands where they kept her. but now, at thirty three, she lives in an apartment in hermosa beach, california that ordell pays for an drops in and out of. she's curled up in a reclining chair, smoking weed from a pipe, reading movieline magazine and paying no attention to the video.}

<D>__{this tec 9? they advertise it as being the most popular gun in american crime. can you believe that shit? it actually says that on the little booklet that comes with it. "most popular gun in american crime," like they're proud of that shit.}
<A>__{ordell hits the fast forward on his remote control. sidney is rushed off the screen and replace by cindy, a pretty, blonde bodybuilder clad in a red, white and blue bikini, holding a styer aug.}
<C>__{ordell }
<D>__{check out this body builder chick... now see what she got. that's a styer aug. styer aug's a bad motherfucker. listen.}
<A>__{ordell punches up the volume. cindy blasts the styer aug, loud. ordell imitates the sound of the weapon.}
<C>__{ordell }
<D>__{shit's expensive, man. comes from austria. my customers don't know shit about it, so there ain't no demand.}
<P>__{(to melanie)}
<D>__{baby, i could use some more ice.}
<A>__{melanie puts down the magazine, takes his cocktail glass from him and moves to the kitchen.}
<C>__{ordell }
<D>__{but put that bad boy in a flick, every motherfucker out there want one. i'm serious as a heart attack. them hong kong movies came out, every nigga gotta have a forty five. and they don't want one, they want two, cause nigga want to be "the killer." what they don't know, and that movie don't tell you is a .45 has a serious fuckin' jammin' problem. i always try and steer a customer towards a 9 millimeter. damn near the same weapon, don't have half the jammin' problems. but some niggas out there, you can't tell them anything. they want a .45. the killer had a .45, they want a .45.}
<A>__{melanie comes back, hands ordell his screwdriver, then sits where she was.}
