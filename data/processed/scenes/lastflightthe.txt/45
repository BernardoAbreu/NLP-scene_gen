<L>__{interior nikki's bedroom that night}
<A>__{nikki sits, soberly polishing cary's bracelet with her nail brush. shep enters, drink in hand.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{hi, nik.}
<A>__{she looks at shep forlornly.}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(sadly)}
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{shep walks over and confronts her.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{cary's in a state. says he's going away. can't stand it any longer and all that sort of thing.}
<P>__{(sits on the bed)}
<D>__{what happened between you two, anyway?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{cary seemed so sad and everything on account of i'd taken up his whole afternoon.}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{so little nikki said, all merry and bright, "well, anyway, we'd found a name for my turtles."}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{a name for the turtles?}
<A>__{shep cracks up with laughter and falls backward on the bed, his head dangling over the edge.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{that's funny!}
<A>__{shep keeps laughing, twists around on the bed and sits up again.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{name for the turtles! that's so funny, all right!}
<A>__{shep holds a hand to his head and catches his breath as nikki joins him on the bed.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{why do you always have to be funny at the wrong time? didn't i tell you cary was brittle? how did he respond to that line?}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(morosely)}
<D>__{pulled down the iron curtain.}
<A>__{shep cracks up again. worried, nikki tugs at his sleeve.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{did he say he was going away?}
<C>__{shep}
<P>__{(through his laughter)}
<D>__{yup. gotta get away from it all.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{then, you've got to go to him right now!}
<A>__{nikki rises and urgently pulls shep, helpless with laughter, to his feet.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{and explain that i didn't mean it! tell him how it was and everything!}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{listen }
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{no, go on. you go right now before it's too late!}
<A>__{she pushes him toward the door.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{but nikki !}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{you go right straight to cary.}
<A>__{they exit.}
