<T>__{to:}
<A>__{jamey runs like hell down a third floor corridor, footsteps making a racket... jamey rushes toward a door marked "judge tate." raised voices from inside judge tate's chambers:}
<C>__{joseph miller }
<D>__{this construction site is causing mortal and irreparable harm to an unsuspecting public!}
<C>__{andrew beckett }
<D>__{my client has one of the finest and most respected safety records in the business, your honor!}
<A>__{jamey shoves open the door, revealing two lawyers (backs to camera) standing before judge eunice tate: andrew beckett (in conservative gray) and joseph miller (in pinstripes).}
<C>__{judge tate}
<D>__{one at a time. mr. miller?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{your honor, since rockwell corp. began construction, the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foul smelling, germ carrying, pestilent dust. my client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily! other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of outrage!}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{your honor, i submit there were no complaints until counselor began knocking on doors, drumming up business. and the dust, which counselor refers to, has appeared on only three occasions. each time it has been examined and the results...}
<A>__{behind his back, andrew wiggles his fingers. jamey stuffs a document into andrew's hand.}
<C>__{andrew }
<D>__{limestone. messy, but innocuous.}
<A>__{andrew submits the report to the judge.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{innocuous?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{defined by webster's as harmless.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i know what it means. your honor, imagine how the children in this neighborhood have been made to feel. the pounding of construction ringing in their ears as this skyscraper, a tribute to mankind's greed, grows daily, casting an ominous shadow over their lives, filling them with dread even as they are surrounded in a black, toxic fog, blocking out the sun while poisoning their lungs! and counselor calls it harmless?!}
<A>__{his back turned momentarily to the judge, andrew mouths to jamey: "not bad." but he whips around, serious again:}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{your honor, counselor is attempting to portray my client as a hideous manifestation of evil and corruption. but nothing could be further from the truth. rockwell has generously contributed ten thousand dollars to this neighborhood's schools, clinics and youth centers! granting a restraining order on the construction site will throw hundreds of philadelphians out of work, and will lend validation to this contemptible and groundless nuisance suit, which speaks directly to the kind of greed and treachery that today is threatening the very fabric of our society.}
<A>__{judge tate looks skeptically at both lawyers.}
<C>__{judge tate}
<D>__{let's not go off the deep end, gentlemen. i thought we were talking about some dust.}
