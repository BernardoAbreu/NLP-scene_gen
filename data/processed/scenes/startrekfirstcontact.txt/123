<L>__{exterior space enterprise airlock}
<A>__{as riker and his team come out of the airlock on the top of the saucer section. it's a spectacular sight as the small group of figures, with weapons at the ready, marches toward the leading edge of the saucer. the scene is lit by light reflected by the earth, which hangs above the ship. on riker & worf as they approach the edge. worf gives a hand signal and the rest of the team spreads out into a tactical deployment and drops down onto their bellies. they crawl up to the very edge of the saucer and pause. worf looks at riker, who looks a little queasy.}
<C>__{worf}
<P>__{(to riker)}
<D>__{are you alright?}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{just a little queasy...}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{and commander, whatever you do... do not vomit in your exo suit. it would be... unpleasant.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{i will keep that in mind.}
<A>__{riker takes a few deep breaths to steady himself.}
<C>__{riker}
<P>__{(to all)}
<D>__{over and under!}
<A>__{they all quickly scramble over the edge and onto the underside of the saucer. the camera rotates and spins with them as they traverse to the underside of the hull they're upside down relative to their previous position, but there's no up or down in space and their magnetized suits hold them to the hull. it's a dizzying moment as we try to orient ourselves to their new position. from this angle, the enterprise appears to be upside down! once they're on the underside of the saucer, they can see the rest of the ship laid out above them. new angle their pov the deflector dish (which is now above us ) is covered with dozens of borg drones, who are working to modify it. some of them turn and see us.}
<B>__{riker and worf}
<A>__{begin running toward the torpedo tube on the saucer. (running is difficult, they must keep one foot on the hull at all times.) several borg phaser shots whip past them as the borg open fire.}
<B>__{the borg}
<A>__{a dozen of them leave the work on the dish and begin skittering down (which is normally up) the interconnecting dorsal on all fours toward our heroes like a swarm of ants a frightening sight.}
<B>__{a security guard}
<A>__{is hit by a phaser shot and goes flying off into space.}
<B>__{the torpedo tube}
<A>__{riker reaches the opening to the torpedo tube, bends down and opens the hatch. borg phaser shots hitting all around him. the open hatch cover provides some protection from the borg fire.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{worf! i'm going to need at least five minutes!}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{understood!}
<A>__{worf and his team lie down on the hull and begin exchanging fire with the approaching mass of borg. they pick off a few borg, who also go flying into space. as riker begins to work...}
