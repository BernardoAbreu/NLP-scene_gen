<A>__{she hurls a wastebasket down the tunnel, into the automatic field of fire. the sentry guns swivel smoothly, the wastebasket bounces once...and is riddled by two quick bursts of exploding 10mm rounds into dime sized shrapnel. they retreat behind a heavy steel fire door which they roll closed on its track. vasquez, using a portable welding torch, begins sealing the door to its frame, as hudson paces nervously.}
