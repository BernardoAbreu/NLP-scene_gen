<L>__{exterior r.v. camp night}
<A>__{twelve mail carriers, including ford, ponytail, chubby, luke and old george, wait as the postman steps up before them. abby's off to the side.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{is this everybody?}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{the rest are on the overdue list.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{this is everybody.}
<P>__{(for all)}
<D>__{got a letter from president starkey.}
<A>__{an excited murmur among the carriers. only ford eyes the postman suspiciously. the postman reads:}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{'greetings all carriers.'}
<C>__{carriers}
<D>__{greetings, president starkey!}
<C>__{the postman}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{'i've been in contact with the postman. i've received all the reports. i'm proud of you all.'}
<A>__{he looks at them, doesn't need to read what's in his heart.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{in dark days, in a weary world, you gave everything and asked for nothing. you beat back despair and replaced it with hope and for that your country can never repay you. but the price is too high. i won't see anymore of my bravest die. it is my duty to hereby disband the postal service of the restored united states. you are to burn your uniforms and the postman is to return to minneapolis at once. thank you and that is all.}
<A>__{a hushed silence. the postman walks away. the carriers exchange tired, defeated looks. abby just sighs, knows he's not necessarily wrong. ford catches up with the postman. he stares at the postman; the postman stares back.}
<C>__{ford}
<P>__{(low; fierce)}
<D>__{the president never wrote that letter.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{if he could've that's what he would have said.}
<A>__{ford gestures to the second letter.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{who's the other letter to?}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{bethlehem. i'm taking it to him in the morning.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{what does it say?}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{mail's private. you know that.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{what does it say?}
<C>__{the postman}
<P>__{(stops; turns)}
<D>__{it says it's over. it says we quit.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{it says you quit. what about the oath?}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{tell me something, ford. how much mail can a dead postman deliver? it's over.}
<A>__{the postman starts to walk away again.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{then i will take it.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i can't trust you.}
<A>__{ford gathers courage and confronts the postman.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{if this is the end. if this is the last piece of mail that ever gets delivered. i will take it.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{whoever takes this letter probably dies for it.}
<A>__{ford thrusts out his hand.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{i'm still a postman. you owe it to me... i owe it to me.}
<A>__{the postman hesitates, studies the intense young man. gives him the letter.}
