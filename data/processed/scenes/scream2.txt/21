<L>__{interior school of film later}
<A>__{sidney moves down a hallway. not your typical school building. through open doorways, film equipment is glimpsed. editing bays and the like. she's in the film department. she comes upon an open door and peers in. a large room, a class is in progress. she slips in quietly.}
<L>__{interior classroom same}
<A>__{sidney takes a seat at the back of the room. a handful of film students sit around on torn couches heavy in discussion. sid goes unnoticed as she watches a whirlwind debate. a snotty guy is pontificating a pointerior}
<C>__{snotty guy}
<D>__{sequels are too handicapped. by definition alone, they're inferior films.}
<A>__{hallie sits on a couch next to mickey, 20's, atheletic, cool and rowdy. arms enwrapped.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{bullshit generalization. many sequels have surpassed their original.}
<C>__{snotty guy}
<D>__{name one.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{aliens far better than the original.}
<C>__{another guy}
<D>__{subjective.}
<C>__{some girl}
<D>__{life's subjective. i much prefer ridley scott.}
<A>__{the conversation overlaps, everyone arguing... making their point about aliens vs. alien.}
<C>__{hallie}
<D>__{no way. aliens rocked. "stay away from her you bitch."}
<C>__{snotty guy}
<D>__{i will give you that one. name another.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{t2.}
<C>__{some girl}
<D>__{you've got a hard on for cameron.}
<C>__{snotty guy}
<D>__{a bigger budget does not make a better movie. terminator one is historical.}
<A>__{someone screams out, "you sarah connor?" as the teacher, a young artsy type, speaks up.}
<C>__{artsy teacher}
<D>__{how about the godfather part ii?}
<A>__{ooooohhh. the whole room goes worship silent. all in agreement.}
<C>__{snotty guy}
<D>__{the almighty exception. name another.}
<A>__{a young man, handsome and smooth, jumps into the conversation. his name is derek.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{empire strikes back. smarter story. improved effects.}
<A>__{from the back of the room, sidney watches him. fixated.}
<C>__{hallie}
<D>__{i liked jedi. with the furry things.}
<A>__{everyone boo's. "ewoks blow."}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{lucas and his romper room stage.}
<C>__{hallie}
<D>__{i got. i got it. friday the 13th, part 20.}
<C>__{snotty guy}
<D>__{case in pointerior the entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels.}
<C>__{artsy teacher}
<D>__{really? and why do you think that is?}
<C>__{snotty guy}
<D>__{sequels suck. hello. it becomes about: money and no one's interested in quality.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{it's more than that. horror films are only as good as their villains. how can freddie and jason possibly be scary after they've been diluted through five or six sequels.}
<C>__{teacher}
<D>__{what's the solution? if you were making a sequel today what would you do differently?}
<A>__{the class stews on this. derek turns, spotting sidney in the back of the room. she gives a half wave. he starts for her, excusing himself.}
<C>__{snotty guy}
<D>__{the point is i made my pointerior sequels suck.}
