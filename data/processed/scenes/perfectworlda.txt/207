<C>__{cleve}
<D>__{come on, mister, do me agin'!}
<A>__{butch smiles and starts to oblige the boy, but mack inter venes and smacks cleve hard, sending him sprawling to the floor bawling. butch, instantly enraged, back hands mack, grabs him by the collar and tosses him onto the floor. phillip frozen, sitting, watching as things go from bad to worse. cleve confused, bawling, afraid. butch pulls the gun from his pants, bends down, picks up mack by his throat, presses the gun in his mouth and lifts him into a chair beside lottie. he bends close to mack their noses are inches apart.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{why'd ya' wanna' go and hit cleve for? he didn't move fast enough for ya', is that it? or maybe he gets excited sometimes and don't hear everything ya' say? you make me sick to my stomach.}
<A>__{butch spits in mack's face, then rises and walks over to phillip and hands him the revolver.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{point it at 'em.}
<C>__{phillip}
<D>__{i don't wanna'...}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{point it!}
<A>__{phillip does so, occasionally wiping a tear from his eye. mack reaches down and holds lottie's hand. butch kneels down to a still sobbing cleve.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{now, son, you wanna' flip?}
<A>__{cleve shakes his head "no" between sobs. butch gently takes the boy and lifts him to a standing position.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{go ahead. put yer' hands between yer' legs. i won't hurt ya'.}
<A>__{cleve turns to mack and then runs to him. butch walks calmly over and pulls the crying child away from the old man and back to the center of the room.}
<C>__{butch}
<P>__{(to mack)}
<D>__{he don't trust ya' no more. you gotta' earn that, ya' know?}
<P>__{(to cleve)}
<D>__{put yer' hands 'tween yer' legs, son.}
<A>__{cleve, still sobbing, does so. butch reaches down and flips him, all the while staring at mack. each time he flips the boy, butch reaches down, grabs cleve's hands and flips him again. finally he allows the frightened child to go to mack and lottie. butch takes the gun from phillip.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{buzz. go out to the car and get that rope.}
<A>__{phillip stands frozen.}
<C>__{butch}
