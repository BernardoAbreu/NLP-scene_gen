<L>__{interior machine shop day}
<A>__{cavernous and dark, a jungle of huge machines, lathes and equipment once used in the design of nuclear submarines. roper moves a few feet inside, remaining in the light and keeping his face in three quarter profile to mccall's position.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{where is she, korda? i want to see her.}
<A>__{from the darkness beyond...}
<C>__{korda}
<D>__{walk to the table.}
<A>__{roper walks to a steel shop table.}
<C>__{korda }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{open your shirt.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{i'm not wearing a wire. this is just between you and me.}
<C>__{korda }
<D>__{shut the fuck up and do what i say!}
<A>__{roper puts down the satchel, unbuttoning his shirt, holding it open.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{satisfied?}
<C>__{korda }
<D>__{open the bag, dump everything on the table.}
<A>__{roper opens the bag, the jewelry and the dozens of glassine envelopes spill out onto the table. he lays the satchel on its side, the bottom facing roper. taped to the bottom is a short barreled .45 automatic.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{it's all there.}
<C>__{korda }
<D>__{spread it out.}
<A>__{roper spreads the pile out across the top of the table.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{only the jewels, korda, you've got my word.}
<A>__{a long beat...}
<C>__{korda }
<D>__{show me something.}
<A>__{without looking roper reaches to the pile of glassine}
<B>__{envelopes...}
<A>__{close on roper's hand palmed in his hand, the envelope containing ronnie's diamond. roper, without looking, 'digs' into the pile, holding up the glassine envelope between his fingers, still holding the palmed envelope. he starts to toss the envelope in his fingers...}
<C>__{korda }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{not that one.}
<A>__{roper hesitates, then drops the envelope, his hand moving over the pile...}
<C>__{roper}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{right there, the one in front... yeah, that one. toss it.}
<A>__{roper reaches for the envelope. close on roper's hand as he flips the palmed envelope into his fingers with the skill of a card shark, exchanging it for the one korda indicated. he tosses it across the room... from the shadows korda's hand reaches out, picking it up. a long beat.}
<C>__{korda }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i'm impressed. i didn't think you could do it. what did you have to do, steal them?}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{korda }
<P>__{(wry)}
<D>__{that's not going to look too good on your service record.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{i will worry about that. let's get on with it.}
<A>__{korda laughs as he slowly emerges from the darkness.}
<C>__{korda}
<D>__{my sentiments exactly.}
