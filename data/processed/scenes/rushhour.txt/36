<C>__{javal}
<D>__{very good. you may go now...}
<A>__{he speaks with a slight accent, french, perhaps. he pops an orange pill, then unlatches the rear doors of the van. with a quick glance back at him, she goes to open the doors. javal grabs a plastic tarp and throws it over the governess' upper body. he puts his arm across her neck, flicks open a gravity knife and plunges it through the tarp, into her chest. he drops her on the floor of the van and fastidiously wipes a small smudge of blood from his hand with a handkerchief.}
