<B>__{on billy}
<A>__{he sits in the living room watching television, a chocolate doughnut in one hand and a remote control device for watching television in the other. off screen sound: a saturday morning kiddie program from the television set.}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(focused on t.v.)}
<D>__{uh, huh...}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you got a letter from mom.}
<A>__{instantly, billy turns down the volume of the television.}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{when is she coming home?!}
<B>__{on ted}
<A>__{as he starts to read, slowly, carefully, so that billy can absorb it.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{"my dear, sweet billy: mommy has gone away. sometimes in the world daddies go away and mommies bring up their little boys. but sometimes a mommy can go away too, and you have your daddy to bring you up."}
<A>__{as ted continues to read, billy starts turning up the sound on the television, using the remote control device.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(raising his voice so he can be heard)}
<D>__{"i have gone away because i must find some interesting things to do for myself in the world. everybody has to, and so do i. being your mommy was one thing, but there are other things and this is what i have to do. i did not get a chance to tell you this, and that is why i am writing you now."}
<A>__{by now the volume from the television is so loud that ted has to shout to make himself heard over it.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{"i will always be your mommy and i will always love you. i just won't be your mommy in the house. but i will be your mommy of the heart. and i... "}
<P>__{(he looks up, about to tell the child to lower the volume)}
<D>__{billy.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{billy sits, watching television with an almost ferocious intensity on his face, doing his best to block out ted's voice.}
<B>__{on ted}
<A>__{he watches his son for a second, then carefully refolds the letter, puts it away.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(as he reaches across,}
<D>__{turns down the sound}
<P>__{on the t.v.)}
<D>__{it's okay... it's okay. we'll talk about it some other time.}
