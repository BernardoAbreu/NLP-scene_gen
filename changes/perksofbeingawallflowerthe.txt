<CHAR>__{DR. BURTON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What's hurting you?}
<CHAR>__{CHARLIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No! Not me. It's them. It's everyone. It never stops. Do you understand?}
<ACTION>__{Dr. Burton smiles, sympathetic. Charlie nods, relieved that someone finally understands. Until...}
<CHAR>__{DR. BURTON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What about your Aunt Helen?}
<ACTION>__{Like cold water. What was tears is now confusion and soon to be shame. Dr. Burton is gentle to him.}
<CHAR>__{CHARLIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What about her?}
<CHAR>__{DR. BURTON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Can you see her?}

<DIAL>__{If you want to get better, you have to--}
<ACTION>__{Charlie looks at her, nodding her encouragement.}
<CHAR>__{CHARLIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{She was... insane.}
<ACTION>__{The minute he says one word of truth, he feels ashamed. He stops talking. Dr. Burton does not press him. Not today.}
<CHAR>__{DR. BURTON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Charlie, are you going to let me help you here?}
<ACTION>__{Charlie cries and nods.}
<CHAR>__{CHARLIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{MOTHER } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{I'm so sorry.}

<ACTION>__{Charlie, Chris, and Candace sit on the bed, playing cards.}
<CHAR>__{CHARLIE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{The best days were those when I could have visitors. My brother and sister always came for those until Chris had to go to training camp. He's going to be first string this year. And my sister told me she met a nice guy at her summer job.}

<ACTION>__{Charlie nods and leaves the hospital with his mother.}
<CHAR>__{CHARLIE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{My doctor said we can't choose where we can come from, but we can choose where we go from there. I know it's not all the answers, but it was enough to start putting these pieces together.}

<ACTION>__{Charlie gets into the back of the truck. He sits down, looking back at the highway. Watching everywhere he's been.}
<CHAR>__{CHARLIE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{Because I know there are people who say all of these things don't happen. And there are people who forget what it's like to be 16 when they turn 17.}

<DIAL>__{CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) I can see it. This one moment when you know you're not a sad story. You are alive. And as you stand up and see the lights on buildings and everything that makes you wonder. And you are listening to that song on that drive with the people you love most in this world.}
<ACTION>__{Charlie stands in the back of the truck.   The wind on his face. He is free.}
<DIAL>__{CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) And in this moment, I swear...}

<DIAL>__{CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) ... we are infinite.}
<ACTION>__{The tunnel song blasts over the speakers as the truck flies out of the tunnel. Sam and Patrick scream with excitement. Charlie holds his arms in the air. The weight of the world gone. If only for a moment. This one moment. We see the city. A million lights like white stars in a glass dome. We crane to the sky. We are in Heaven.}
