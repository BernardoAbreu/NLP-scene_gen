<D>__{let's move.}
<A>__{rambo and brewer, carrying de fravio, charge up and over the dike as the ground is ripped around them. rambo hurls two smoke grenades down the dike wall. columns of red and green smoke begin roiling upward. the dike on which they are pinned down forms part of the enclosure for a complex of terraced rice paddies which occupy the few flat acres of this hilly terrain. the flooded fields reflect the pre dawn sky like plates of burnished metal. rambo slams in another clip and fires in short, controlled burst. brewer hands a captured ak 47 to de fravio. the ex pow opens up with a vengeance.}
