<P>__{(hits keys)}
<D>__{score. thank you. madmax from omaha we own you. and tragedy is closed out.}
<A>__{seth leans over and snorts a line of coke from a mirror. he hands it to caroline who effortlessly does one.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{entertainment. the susan lucci section or banal love songs of the nineties?}
<A>__{seth looks at her. he has a crush.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{banal love songs it is.}
<P>__{(hits keys)}
<D>__{hey, you wanna try something?}
<A>__{she nods. they both take a swig of beer. he takes her hand pulling her past the stoned people on the couch }
<B>__{in the kitchen}
<A>__{seth takes out a box of baking soda. he tears off a square of aluminum foil. he takes out a spoon. caroline watches as he dumps a small amount of cocaine into the spoon. he adds a pinch of baking soda. he puts in a few drops of water. stirs it around with the heel of a lighter. then holds the flame under the spoon.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(concentrating)}
<D>__{just watch.}
<A>__{he watches the substance in the spoon as it swirls and bubbles, then separates... he pours the most viscous part onto the aluminum foil, making four separate little puddles. he quickly dismantles a ballpoint pen, making a straw. he hands it to caroline.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{inhale the smoke and hold it.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{what is this, like freebase?}

<C>__{seth}
<D>__{hold it.}
<A>__{she pulls it in deeper and holds... suddenly her expression changes... her eyes lose their focus, her face slackens, an almost sexual response. seth is watching her intensely.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{see... now, you see.}
<A>__{caroline slumps back against the counter. seth moves against her, kissing her, running his hands over her breasts and body. she stares over his shoulder, holding it as long as she can. finally she exhales }

<D>__{more.}
<A>__{the cloud of grey smoke from her lungs fills the room.}
