<L>__{interior tecumseh high school corridor night}
<A>__{julie dashes out of the girls' locker room, passing a janitor. ted follows, dripping water.}
<C>__{janitor}
<D>__{i'm sorry, mr. ted. she pushed right past me.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(calling after julie)}
<D>__{at least let me explain!}
<A>__{julie darts into the girls' restroom. ted stops at the door. then realizes there is no one else around. he heads inside.}
<L>__{interior girls' restroom continuous}
<A>__{julie's too proud to let him see her cry. but we can tell she's upset.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{go away, ted. just go.}
<A>__{ted corners her near a row of sinks.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{please believe me. it was just a kiss for old time's sake. i've had a stupid crush on her since i was seven, but i never got closer to her than four feet and then there she was right in front of me, completely naked.}
<A>__{julie looks at him, pensively. she unzips the back of her summery dress. and lets it fall to the floor. she's completely naked and absolutely gorgeous. ted gasps. he's been around dozens of naked women by now, but this one he can't just gawk at. this one he really cares about.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{being naked is no big deal. it has nothing to do with emotion, nothing to do with love. you can be around all the naked girls you want and you won't be even one step closer to anything meaningful in your life.}
<A>__{she puts on her dress, gracefully. as if nothing happened.}
<C>__{julie }
<D>__{see that? you don't know me even one ounce better than you did before. you and your stupid magazine. i liked you better when you were sweet and kind and human, like the rest of us.}
<A>__{at that moment, ted's cell phone rings. julie walks away, leaving ted completely alone. he answers, lifelessly...}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{uncle billy }
<D>__{we've got a huge problem with the magazine, ted baby. our readers hate it. hate it. we need to talk.}
