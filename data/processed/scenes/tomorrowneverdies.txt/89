<L>__{exterior 'harmsway building' (hong kong and shanghai bank) hong kong dusk}
<A>__{super: hong kong. harmsway's helicopter is perched atop the famous tinker toy styled building in the central district.}
<L>__{interior penthouse boardroom dusk}
<A>__{a chinese chop comes down firmly on a legal document. general li (of the people's revolutionary army) is seated with a squad of lawyers:}
<C>__{general li}
<D>__{and that is the fifth document. with your counter signature, the sale will be complete.}
<A>__{the document is passed across to harmsway, sitting with his own legal counsel. one of the men is whispering to him, intensely:}
<C>__{young chinese lawyer}
<D>__{are you sure? if we waited }
<A>__{harmsway waves the lawyer off, silencing him. addresses the general:}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{general li: my young associate here has just informed me that if i waited a year, i could perhaps receive a higher price for this building.}
<P>__{(beat, wryly)}
<D>__{he has great faith in hong kong. as did my ancestors. with obvious results.}
<A>__{nervous chuckles around the table, but the general is reserved.}
<C>__{harmsway }
<D>__{yet to sell this building for more money to profiteer would run counter to the chinese sprit of guanchi mutual trust and obligation; it would violate the ancient principles of feng shui }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{ the reason we sign five documents instead of an unlucky four, and why this building has a fifth, non functioning ventilation shaft on its roof.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{wind and water, fire and rain, earth and sky feng shui. all things at one, in balance, with nature.}
<C>__{general li}
<D>__{...most eloquently put, sir elliot.}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{thank you, general li. now i will just sign this last document }
<A>__{he puts the pen to the paper, and breaks the pen. alarmed looks.}
<C>__{harmsway }
<D>__{terribly sorry. mr. stamper?}
<A>__{from behind, stamper hands him a pen. harmsway innocently starts to sign in red ink }
<C>__{general li}
<D>__{sir elliot! red ink }
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{of course! how foolish. more bad luck. i will just borrow yours }
<A>__{he takes general li's pen, and signs his name with a flourish.}
