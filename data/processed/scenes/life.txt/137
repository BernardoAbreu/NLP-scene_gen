<A>__{nurse humphries, willie and the rest of the inmates watch grimly as flames engulf the building. nobody could survive this blaze. from the highway comes the siren wail of approaching fire engines. but it's too late. sparks erupt into the night sky as the roof collapses...}
<L>__{exterior infirmary dawn}
<A>__{fire trucks pull away from the smoldering ruins. a local reporter interviews witnesses. investigators comb through the wreckage, making notes. county coroners pull a couple of gurneys from the back of their van.}

<A>__{superintendent bill burke is led through the destruction by a fire inspector. they approach the coroners as they finish zipping up two body bags.}

<D>__{how did it start?}
<C>__{fire inspector}
<D>__{probably old wires. the place was a tinderbox just waiting to go.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{i guess we should have torn this old building down a long time ago.}
