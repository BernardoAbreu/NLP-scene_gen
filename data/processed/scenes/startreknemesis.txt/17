<L>__{exterior enterprise over kolarus iii day}
<A>__{the shuttlebay doors slide open and the transport vehicle argo emerges. the argo is larger than a regular shuttle with a particularly large cargo area at the back.}
<L>__{exterior kolarus iii day}
<A>__{the argo lands on the planet. it is primarily a desert environment with some canyons and mountains. like death valley, blazing heat waves shimmer in the distance. the shuttle sits silently for a moment. we wonder at the delay, then... the rear cargo doors slide open and picard, data and worf roar out on a 24th century equivalent of a military jeep! picard drives, data beside him. worf stands in the back at a mounted phaser canon. it is a muscular, exciting vehicle; a starfleet version of the jeep from old television series "the rat patrol." picard screeches to a stop. data and worf lurch. a cloud of dust momentarily obscures them. data quickly monitors the positronic signatures with a tricorder:}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{the closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{thank you, data.}
<P>__{(he smiles)}
<D>__{let's see what she can do.}
<A>__{he roars off in a cloud of dust! picard clearly enjoys driving. he roars over the desert terrain at breakneck speed, having a hell of a good time. his comrades don't exactly appreciate his free spirited driving panache. worf clings on to the mounted phaser canon for dear life. data steadies himself by grasping onto the rollbar}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{i will always be baffled by the human predilection for piloting vehicles at unsafe velocities.}
<A>__{picard smiles and drives a little faster.}
<C>__{data}
<P>__{(monitoring with tricorder)}
<D>__{over that rise, sir... half a kilometer.}
<A>__{they continue on. before long they can see something on the level desert floor before them. they approach and stop to discover... an android arm. the fingers patiently drumming the ground.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{it appears to be...}
<P>__{(he scans with his tricorder)}
<D>__{... an arm.}
<C>__{worf}
<P>__{(suspicious)}
<D>__{why is it moving?}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{like me, it has been designed with modular power sources.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{mister worf, if you please.}
<A>__{worf climbs from the jeep and carefully approaches the arm. gingerly picks it up. the arm responds to being picked up, the hand starts feeling around in the air like something from a horror movie. worf shudders. he returns to the jeep. quickly sets the arm down in the rear cargo area.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{the next signature is one kilometer to the south.}
<A>__{picard starts the jeep in motion. time passes as they continue on... coming across another arm... a leg... a torso... another leg... various disassembled components of a data like android!}
