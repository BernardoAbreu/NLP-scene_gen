<L>__{interior dunwitty's office morning}
<A>__{one by one, the team enters the office and sits down on the sofa.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{delacroix, i'm glad you got your mind right.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{it's right and tight. good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. you know my assistant, sloan.}
<C>__{sloan}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{this is cheeba.}
<C>__{cheeba}
<D>__{nice to meet you.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{and this is manray.}
<C>__{manray}
<D>__{how do you do?}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{good. i like the names. very theatrical.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{we're all happy to be here and i'm going to paint a picture for you.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{i'm wid it.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{i've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right. in my previous work it's been all surface, superficial. i have never really dug deep. not anymore. as mark twain fully understood satire is the way. race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder. if we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. it's about promoting racial healing.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{go on. good so far.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{i know you're familiar with minstrel shows. they came about at the turn of the 19th century. it was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface singing, dancing, telling jokes, doing skits. dunwitty, i ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air. carol burnett? heehaw?}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{word!!!}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{so let's take this great form, this very american tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{the name of the show?}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{it is called: mantan the new millennium minstrel show.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{i'm lovin' it. you know how i know? because i'm getting a boner, my johnson is hard, no disrespect my sister.}
<A>__{dunwitty starts walking around his office, pumping his first.}
<C>__{dunwitty }
<D>__{i'm feelin' dis'!}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{it will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the cns to get this on the air. in fact, i would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{don't worry about that, that's my department. now who do we cast? we need a star. can whoopi sing or dance?}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{i don't know if whoopi is the way to go.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose? which one is mantan again?}
<C>__{mantan}
<D>__{that's me.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{and cheeba is sleep 'n' eat.}
<B>__{close on}
<A>__{cheeba. a look of surprise is on his face. complete, utter surprise.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{that's a great handle.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{mantan and sleep 'n eat. two real coons. i know we're way out there but it's satire.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{i want you take it there. all the way to the edge and back.}
<A>__{sloan looks at delacroix with concern.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons mantan and sleep 'n eat. the dusky duo.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{what are there character traits?}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{exactly!}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{mantan is an uneducated negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{and sleep 'n eat is his comical sidekick?}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{yep, you guessed it.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{this could be bigger than "amos and andy."}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{protest finally forced "amos and andy" off the air. could stop us from ever getting on.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{let'em try. i will kill to make this happen.}
<A>__{delacroix looks at sloan.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{negroes would be in an uproar.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{so what. we would just give the naacp a donation that would be the end of that. no such thing as bad publicity. so what. earlier you said singing and dancing.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{mantan right here is a gifted hoofer. he has educated feet.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{who are the other characters?}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{do we have characters? how about honeycutt, snowflake, rastus, nigger, jim, sambo, jungle bunny, and how could we forget aunt jemima.}
<A>__{dunwitty is dying with laughter. he's the only one.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{we gonna hit 'em wid da bomb dickey on dis' one. what's the setting?}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{in the projects. like eddie murphy's "the pj's."}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{ya first bad move. projects been done. that's one of the problems now, everything, movies, tv, are set in the urban jungle, da hood. that's so tired. mantan's millennium minstrel show should be set on a plantation. in alabama.}
<C>__{dunwitty }
<D>__{and every week these alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity. make us feel good to be alive.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{i don't know about that plantation angle.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{what are you talkin' 'bout? it's the move. stay wid me now. we're movin' fast. what does everybody else think about this?}
<C>__{sloan}
<D>__{we'd get a lot of mail.}
<A>__{she laughs, it's a fake one at that.}
<C>__{sloan }
<D>__{mr. dunwitty, there wouldn't be another show like it.}
<C>__{cheeba}
<D>__{i've always wanted to be on television.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{i like you. sleep 'n eat. that's funny. mantan, how do you feel about performing in black face?}
<C>__{mantan}
<D>__{as long as the hoofing is real, that i can do my thing, i can blacken up. let me hit it, beats and rhythms, express myself.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{show me a little somethin' somethin'.}
<A>__{mantan starts to put on his new tap shoes.}
<C>__{dunwitty }
<D>__{delacroix, you dug deep, deeper than deep.}
<A>__{mantan is ready.}
<C>__{mantan}
<D>__{i'm gonna give you just a taste. my tap shoes are brand new. i haven't trained 'em yet.}
<A>__{he starts to work out.}
<C>__{mantan }
<D>__{rhythms, rhythms, rhythms. beats, beats, beats. no fred astaire here, baby. just rawness.}
<A>__{dunwitty clears his desk of everything, just knocks stuff flying onto the floor. and mantan taking the cue, jumps up on his desk and really starts hitting it.}
<B>__{close on}
<A>__{delacroix, as he watches his creation, it's not a happy face.}
<B>__{close on}
<A>__{mantan, he's bringing it home. with the final move, he leaps off the desk into the middle of the office, and freezes.}
<B>__{angle on}
<A>__{the office.}
<C>__{dunwitty}
<D>__{that'swhati'mtalkin''bout. that'swhati'mtalkin''bout! he's off the hiz hook!}
