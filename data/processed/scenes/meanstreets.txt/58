<A>__{charlie is walking down the street on the lower east side. a noisy religious street festival is being held on the block.}
<L>__{interior small italian cafe day}
<A>__{charlie enters a small italian cafe and nods greetings to some of the people as he makes his way to the back of the room. this cafe is a strange hybred of coffee house, candy store, luncheonette, and meeting place for charlie's uncle giovanni and his associates. giovanni de stefano is sixty. he is well respected and powerful both in and out of the neighborhood. he became a head figure not by being introduced formally as was the custom, but rather by fighting and killing his way into the organization. giovanni is well dressed but not a stereotype of an old mafioso, rather a kindly and intelligent old man. giovanni converses intermittently in italian. a man is putting new records into the jukebox which is in the corner of the room in the luncheonette area.}

<C>__{repair man}
<D>__{yeah, but i think he's busy now. hey charlie play 463 today for sure.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{thanks!}
<A>__{charlie walks through the luncheonette area, past the dining room where his uncle is in conference, to the bathroom at the very back of the cafe. mario is seated with his uncle. mario is forty five years old. he is giovanni's closest associate, brought into the organization in the traditional manner, making his early reputation through hits (murders). he is not very intelligent but has an undying loyalty to giovanni, and is very fond of charlie. mario and giovanni are seated with a very old man. they are deep in their private conversation. charlie passes by unnoticed and walks into the bathroom. charlie begins to wash his hands but changes his mind. he shuts off the faucet in order to eavesdrop on the conversation.}
