<L>__{interior professor spaulding's office day}
<A>__{parker sits genteelly forward in her chair, legs crossed just so at the ankles, hands folded in her lap.}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(primly)}
<D>__{i promise you, though my missing the deadline seems to suggest otherwise, my studies would never suffer on account of my being unorganized. this was, and i think anyone who knows me would vouch for this, a complete anomaly.}
<C>__{parker }
<D>__{i was so thrown when my sister asked bernard to the dance that i simply failed to post the schedule request and seeing it already checked off on my to do list, i over looked it until after the deadline had passed.}
<C>__{professor spaulding}
<D>__{ms. macleod, i recall your application being one of the strongest we received. not seeing your name on the interview list surprised me. i assumed, of course, that you'd changed your mind.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{no. not at all. this program is my number one priority.}
<C>__{professor spaulding}
<D>__{yes, well, i'm sure you can appreciate that with so many applicants for so few spaces there must be rules to govern the selection process.}
<A>__{a fuss from the outer office interrupts them and suddenly the door bursts open and drew bursts in:}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{professor spaulding? i can't apologize enough for barging in like this.}
<A>__{the professor is not only thrown by the interruption, but by drew's particularly bizarre, barefoot look.}
<C>__{professor spaulding}
<D>__{no. please. it looks like i'm taking the red eye now anyway.}
<A>__{drew shuts the door and then is startled when she gets a face full of parker, already there.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{parker?}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(worried wink)}
<D>__{hi, parker.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(don't blow it)}
<D>__{oh, the professor and i have had a wonderful talk about how important this program is to me and how it was my sister, drew, who screwed things up.}
<C>__{professor spaulding}
<D>__{i'm having a little trouble following this.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{you were... being me?}
<C>__{professor spaulding}
<P>__{(to drew)}
<D>__{would you like to sit down?}
<A>__{seeing her plan to help drew go awry, poor parker's lip trembles.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{when i saw them take you to jail...}
<C>__{professor spaulding}
<D>__{jail?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{... i didn't think you'd make it. i knew i wouldn't be any good at it, but i figured at least there was a chance.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that's... sweet.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{you're not mad?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i'm so sorry for today.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{it's okay. but let's talk about it later.}
<C>__{professor spaulding}
<D>__{please. go right ahead.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{parker, consider, just for a moment, whether this is the appropriate time and place.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{okay, i considered. what i want to say is, i didn't purposefully set out to ruin your day, but that doesn't mean i'm not a little... jealous.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{jealous?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i'm not like you. i don't have your intensity, your focus, your...}
<C>__{professor spaulding}
<D>__{fashion sense?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i just mean, maybe, even if i don't intend to, maybe that jealousy, you know, gets in the way sometimes.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{you mean subliminally you're undermining me?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i don't know if i'd get that technical about it. but yeah.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{well, thank you for saying that.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{you're welcome.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{aren't you going to confess now?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{confess what?}
<C>__{professor spaulding}
<D>__{there's got to be something. like how you lost your shoes?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{how you're secretly jealous of me?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{why would i be jealous of you?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{oh, let me see. because i don't have a stick up my butt? because i know how to have fun? because i'm spontaneous and creative and men are all my love slaves?}
<A>__{drew stops, ponders this deeply.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{nope.}
<A>__{then she smiles, only a teensy bit.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{well, maybe about the love slaves.}
<A>__{this is the first moment in a long time when the sisters share a smile. drew turns to the professor.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{professor, i'm drew macleod.}
<C>__{professor spaulding}
<D>__{are you certain?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i wanted more than anything in the world to be a part of your program. i still do. but i failed. i didn't follow the rules. and honestly, before today, i didn't know how i was going to live with that. how to live with failure. i'm not good at it. i haven't done it much. but today i realized that i've lived in fear of it too long.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{i hope my application was a strong one and i came here today to ask your indulgence and to place my name back into consideration. if you won't, i will understand. better yet, i will get over it. maybe i shouldn't be in such a hurry after all. maybe it would be best for me to just take this...}
<A>__{drew takes her daybook from parker and drops it in the wastebasket.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{... and lighten up.}
<A>__{parker looks horrified at the sight of drew's daybook in the trash and fishes it out.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{thanks for your time. sorry if you missed your plane.}
<A>__{he shakes her hand.}
<C>__{professor spaulding}
<D>__{it was worth it, i assure you. now, could you clear up one thing for me? drew parker sure.}
<C>__{professor spaulding}
<D>__{what's this about jail?}
