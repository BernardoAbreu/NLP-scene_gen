<L>__{interior high school gymnasium night}
<A>__{the following is shot documentary style. a girls volleyball game has just ended. it was a big game. some kind of championship. one team is celebrating jumping up and down, squealing and hugging each other. we are focused on the bench of the team trat lost. they're very sad several are crying. one girl, in particular, (amy) is really sobbing. she's sweat stained, tired and just blubbering. stuff's coming out of her eyes, her nose, her mouth and the camera is seeing it all. the coach, a fortyish man looks at all the weeping girls amy in particular.}
<C>__{coach}
<D>__{you quit! you gave up!}
<A>__{he kicks a chair. now amy is really a mess. she's crying, coughing, shaking.}
<C>__{coach }
<P>__{(right in amy's face)}
<D>__{you quit!!}
<A>__{the coach storms off.}
<C>__{coach }
<D>__{qutters! ... quitters!}
<A>__{amy is wailing and choking on her own tears. this image freezes.}
<C>__{terry }

<L>__{interior office day}
<B>__{begin credits}
<A>__{we're in new york city. we're in the conference room of a modestly successful cable tv station called "real tv." the people are young, energetic, clever. it's crowded, noisy the furniture is beaten up, bulletin boards cover the walls, with large index cards all over them. this room is not for show work gets done here. seven or eight people are present. one of them is cynthia reed. she's the boss.}
<C>__{terry}
<P>__{(to cynthia)}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{it's horrible, it's depressing, i love it. what else?}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{i want to re pitch that pregnancy idea. find six women early in their pregnancies and follow them all right through to the births.}
<C>__{keith}
<P>__{(negative)}
<D>__{yeah, when all that stuff comes out.}
<A>__{mixed reactions, mostly negative.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i have an idea.}
<B>__{immediate attention}
<C>__{cynthia }
<D>__{this is something i've been thinking about for a long time. we're "real tv" right? i mean that's the name of the station.}
<B>__{agreement}
<C>__{cynthia }
<D>__{so let's go real. we find someone. just a regular person, someone. and we put their life on television live... all day long.}
<A>__{silence. no movement at all.}
<C>__{cynthia }
<D>__{calm down.}
<C>__{keith}
<D>__{what do you mean, like pbs did in the seventies? what was that family?}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{the louds.}
<C>__{keith}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{no. we go way beyond that. we don't film it and edit it and put it on later. we go on the air live every morning and the show goes off each night, when our subject goes to bed. in between, we're on live all day, every day the same person, for}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{let's say a month.}
<A>__{no one is wild for this. some hate it some are unconvinced.}
<C>__{felicia}
<D>__{that's not a show that's a surveillance camera.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{you can't do that.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{the hell we can't. look, the beauty of being a cable channel is we can take chances. i've thought about this and i'm telling you, i think this can make a noise. a loud one. there are twelve thousand channels. you've got to do something that says "look at me!" hell, people look at fish tanks all day. this is people!}
<P>__{(more firmly)}
<D>__{someone's real life an tv, all day long live... and, you know what? i'm doing it.}
<A>__{pause. the others know the argument is over.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{in that case, we love it.}
<B>__{end credits}
<L>__{exterior pool hall day}
<A>__{a bus passes. on the bus is an ad. it says, "would you like to star in your own tv show? call real tv (and a phone number) coming (and a date)."}
<L>__{interior pool hall night paramus new jersey}
<A>__{this is a nice upscale pool hall. a party is in progress in a special private area a room upstairs let's say a loft. thirty or forty people in their twenties and thirties are informally celebrating the engagement of two of their friends. it's noisy, it's fun, it's informal. it's not a high end group. by that we mean, not, for the most part young lawyers or stockbrokers. they're mostly blue collar. community college graduates. we open on ed pekurny. he's an attractive man, about thirty. there's still something a little juvenile about him not stupid, just boyish. someone is videotaping him for one of those congratulation montage things that are done at parties these days. ed is good at this. he's not professional but he's a loosey goosey guy who's kind of good on camera.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{i want to congratulate kevin and tracy on their engagement. i knew you guys were meant for each other from the moment tracy told us she was pregnant.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{you asshole!}
<A>__{everyone else is cracking up.}
<C>__{ed}
<P>__{(innocently)}
<D>__{what? what did i say?}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{my mother's going to see this!}
<L>__{interior party later}
<A>__{other people are being "interviewed" on tape. ed is shooting pool with his buddy, john. john's had a couple of drinks. he's a little melancholy. he is looking across the room, thoughtfully.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{look at this people are getting married, they're getting married...}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{you said that.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{we're falling behind.}
<A>__{ed waves dismissively.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{you know who we are?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{tell me.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{we're the guys who clean up after the parade.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{i'm gonna stick this right in your eye.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "if you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." and i'm laughing and then i realize i wear a nametag.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{so do i. so what? i'm doing all right.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{your brother's here.}
<B>__{angle on the door}
<A>__{ed's brother ray and ray's girlfriend shari arrive at the party. shari is pretty in an unglamorous kind of way. they both wave and then shari goes off to talk to some of the ladies and ray joins ed and john.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{what's up?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{where were you?}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(reluctantly)}
<D>__{i was... having dinner with shari and her parents. john ed}
<P>__{(taunting)}
<D>__{oooh!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i'm telling you, it's closing in on me. all of a sudden it's like a thing, it's a whole thing.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{what do you mean all of a sudden? you've been going with her six months.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i know. i mean i'm sitting there and her father's asking me about my "career prospects" and i'm playing "risk," with her kid brother, leon and at dinner the dog's sniffing at my balls at least i hope it was the dog. 'cause her mother disappeared for a while.}
<A>__{they laugh.}
<L>__{interior party later}
<A>__{it's getting wild. some of the girls are dancing raucously. angle on a table (not a pool table, an eating table) ed, ray, john, shari and maybe another woman. ray is holding a big tray of shrimp balls. during the conversation, ray throws them in the air and catches them in his mouth like popcorn. once, he even bounces one off the wall into his mouth.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{you know, those are for everybody.}
<A>__{ray waves dismissively, then gets an idea.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{oh!}
<P>__{(to shari)}
<D>__{show them that thing you can do.}
<P>__{(to the others)}
<D>__{this is great. i just found out she can do this, her brother told me.}
<P>__{(to shari)}
<D>__{come on.}
<C>__{shari}
<P>__{(thinks it's stupid)}
<D>__{i don't }
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{come on...}
<A>__{she hesitates, but she really doesn't mind. slightly, amused she takes her fist and fits it completely into her mouth.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{whoa!! oh!}
<A>__{ray is cracking up.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{is that unbelievable?}
<A>__{she removes her hand.}
<C>__{shari}
<D>__{and that concludes today's show.}
<P>__{(to ray)}
<D>__{this is where you go around and collect the money.}
<A>__{ed laughs. ray gives her a kiss. shari's roommate rita sits down.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{shari}
<D>__{you guys know my roommate, rita.}
<A>__{they do, vaguely.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{what's going on over there?}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{everybody's making audition tapes for that real tv thing.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{oh, that thing. yeah. did you hear about this?}
<C>__{ed}
<P>__{(not sure)}
<D>__{yeah, what they put some schmuck on tv all day long or something?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you know, that would be like a great thing.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{that! being that guy. being the guy they watch.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{what are you drunk?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{yeah, but let's stay on one subject. whoever that person is is going to be famous. they'll be able to get whatever they want. they'll ... trust me, this is my business.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{what is?!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{show business.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{you're in show business?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{yeah. i service video equipment.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{that's like... those people stitching nikes in panama saying they're in the nba.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(insulted)}
<D>__{i'm not stitching nikes in panama! ... bedwetter!}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{thumbsucker!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i'm making a tape.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{we're excited.}
<L>__{interior bar a few minutes later}
<A>__{ed and shari, waiting for drink orders.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{so ray met the family.}
<C>__{shari}
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{i hear the dog really liked him.}
<C>__{shari}
<D>__{oh, the whole family loved him. of course, they loved the last guy i went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{really? you see, to me, you shouldn't have any trouble with men. there should be, like, a line behind you.}
<A>__{she takes ed's beer.}
<C>__{shari}
<D>__{you shouldn't drink.}
<A>__{they laugh.}
<L>__{interior table a little later}
<A>__{ed and shari arm wrestling. after a struggle, ed wins. ed is impressed.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{jesus!}
<A>__{shari wrings out her arm and picks up her beer.}
<C>__{shari}
<P>__{(continuing a previous conversation)}
<D>__{and, you know, every guy i ever broke up with, the minute it was over, i could tell you what went wrong, how it went wrong, why it had to go wrong... but when i'm in it... lost. i'm like a love coroner. bring me the corpse, i'11 tell you what killed it. but how to prevent it? lost.}
<A>__{ed laughs.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{ray's on.}
<A>__{they walk over.}
<B>__{angle on ray}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(to camera)}
<D>__{hi. i'm ray pekurney. i'm from paramus, new jersey...}
<L>__{interior cynthia's office day}
<A>__{she's watching ray's tape. ray thinks he's funnier and cuter than he is.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{all my friends tell me "ray, you've got too much personality for one guy." it's like at a party i'm at the center of the attention. everybody loves me.}
<A>__{he gets hit in the face by a hors d'oeuvre.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{ha, ha, ha. i will kick your ass. no really, let me show you my girlfriend. she's really cute.}
<A>__{he reaches out and grabs shari's wrist. shari is struggling to stay out of frame. we just see her arm and ray pulling on it. ray lets go.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{she's strong, 'cause she's a fedex girl. she lifts those packages. but she's not dikey at all, she's really pretty.}
<A>__{cynthia fast forwards we see the camera shooting an empty space. then ed's head appears sideways right in front of the camera.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{hello i'm ed.}
<A>__{he starts to sniff.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{what smells?}
<A>__{he steps back from the camera and straightens his head as he sniffs. he's more relaxed than ray.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{what is that smell? oop, i think it's this idea. one person on tv all day long?}
<P>__{(screams)}
<D>__{are you nuts?}
<B>__{we hear laughs}
<A>__{the real tv staff are enjoying ed's tape while they eat lunch out of styrofoam containers.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{seriously, get your resumes in order. when my brother ray whose personality you were just dazzled by told me he was going to try out for this i said, "why in the world would anyone want to be on tv all day long, no privacy, everybody knowing your business, exposing every single detail of your life i mean... why would anyone want to do that? but then i thought of a reason...}
<P>__{(loudly)}
<D>__{why the hell not?}
<A>__{he kisses the lens, smudging it. cynthia, watching, cracks up. the others seem to like him to.}
<L>__{interior video store day}
<A>__{this is a video store in paramus, new jersey. it's busy. people are in line to check out tapes. we open on a woman a mother who is rummaging through her purse for her blockbuster card. she looks up and sees that her two children have opened several boxes of candy from the candy display and are eating from the boxes.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{oh for put those oh god...}
<A>__{she grabs the boxes from them. the boxes are ripped more than she thought and candy goes flying all over. she bends to pick it up. ed appears. he works here.}
<C>__{ed}
<P>__{(to the mom)}
<D>__{we'11 take care of it.}
<A>__{someone arrives with a broom.}
<C>__{ed }
<P>__{(to the broom guy)}
<D>__{here. this time throw it out, don't eat it.}
<A>__{lou, the manager passes.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{lou, can i talk to you a second?}
<A>__{lou seems like he'd prefer to avoid this.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{um, yeah, i was gonna ...}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{what's the deal? did anybody make a decision }
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. they're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when i leave to manage the new store. i'm sorry.}

<D>__{you batted or you bunted?}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{hey. i went as far as i felt comfortable. i mean, you know, let's face it you come and go here as you please. you work when you feel like it you know, bruce springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{well, then i'm quitting.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{ed, come on. what's that gonna do? you're gonna bring blockbuster to their knees. let me recommend a movie to you. it's called "get your shit together before it's too late."}

<D>__{yeah... are you serious? ... come on, no kidding, who is this? ... holy shit!}
<L>__{interior conference room another day}
<A>__{ed is being interviewed by the "real tv" staff whom we met earlier. he's slightly less comfortable than on his tape, but he's good.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{i had one year of college. and then one year of junior college.}
<C>__{cynthia }
<D>__{what did you study?}
<C>__{ed}

<L>__{interior conference room later}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{well, there's ray, my brother. he's... ambitious. like a few years ago, he started this mobile dog grooming business. but, like, out of his camry. he had this bathtub in his trunk }
<P>__{(ed starts cracking up)}
<D>__{he's throwing the dogs in there, they're fighting and splashing, then he'd slam the trunk down, let 'em run around inside screaming getting all wet... then he'd use the car exhaust to dry'em.}
<P>__{(wiping his eyes)}
<D>__{ah, ray... he just can't get a break.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior conference room later}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{my sister marcia, i mean she can't get a break. about seven years ago she falls in love with this vietnamese guy who wants to marry her so he can stay in the country. so they get married, they have a kid, he gets his citizenship, immediately divorces my sister and marries this vietnamese woman who, he was probably already married to all along. she can pick 'em.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{she's got a nice little boy, though. my nephew, andy.}

<D>__{no, i've never been married.}
<A>__{the interviewer seems to be waiting for him to elaborate. he doesn't. he shrugs that's it.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior conference room later}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{oh, my father what an asshole. when i was twelve, my mother needed a hysterectomy my father ran off with her nurse! and that's the last i heard of him.}

<D>__{i like my job i mean i'm doing all right. i'm not sure how long i want to stay there, you know... i mean, i'm thirty one... i'm not sure i want to be a video store clerk when i'm forty... of course, i didn't expect to be doing it 'til i was thirty one, either. but... you know i'm... keeping my options open. anything comes along, i'm ready to pounce.}

<D>__{a dream? of course i have a dream i just don't know what the hell it is.}
<P>__{(shrugs and smiles)}
<A>__{ed's image freezes, while he has a funny cute expression on his face. pull back to reveal a tv in a conference room with ed's frozen image on it. cynthia is there with her bosses, the people who run the network that owns real tv. the top man is mr. scharlach. his deputies are ms. seaver and mr. mcilvaine. this is not the same place where we met cynthia and her staff. this is richer, more corporate and formal.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{he's who we want to go with.}
<C>__{scharlach}
<P>__{(doubtfully)}
<D>__{this guy.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i polled my staff. the men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. and one of the men said he's fuckable.}
<C>__{scharlach}
<D>__{i'm not sure about the entire concept.}
<A>__{cynthia is frustrated.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{look it's not like we're burning up the airwaves now. we're running neck and neck with the gardening channel. if people just tune in to this twice a day for five minutes, we're a hit. plus we can sell advertising every second, running at the bottom of the screen... and the beauty is this guy doesn't even have to be good. i mean if he's good, great. but if he winds up making an ass of himself, better. mcilvaine how is that better?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{come on. people cannot turn away from an accident. you drive by, you say "ooh, i hope there's not a head lying in the road" but you look ! see, nobody in america wants to be nobody. this guy wants to be famous. so, basically, the deal is he agrees to drive down the highway a hundred miles an hour blindfolded and we get to see if his head winds up rolling down the highway. fun for the whole family. so let's do it.}
