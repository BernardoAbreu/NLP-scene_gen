<L>__{interior quality cafe late afternoon}
<A>__{the cafe has been fully remodeled and now resembles wowsville more than the old quality cafe. there are no neighborhood "characters" anymore, only well heeled twenty somethings. we see that rebecca is now a waitress here. she tears off a check and places it in front of a super muscular, polo shirted european hipster, who is too busy tapping away at his powerbook to notice. she walks toward the end of the counter to total up her receipts. she looks up and sees enid, wearing tasteful 1930's style clothes, sitting across from her.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{oh, hi... i almost didn't recognize you i think i need to get glasses; you're all blurry!}
<C>__{enid}
<P>__{(nodding toward muscular hipster)}
<D>__{you're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{actually, he's a really nice guy.}
<A>__{we see at this point that rebecca & enid are no longer friends, but there are also no hard feelings evident.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{do you want anything?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{maybe an orange juice.}
<A>__{rebecca goes to get it. enid looks around, bemused and saddened by what the quality cafe has become.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{hey, look what i got...}
<A>__{she takes a crumpled envelope from her pocket and pulls out her diploma.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{wow... finally.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{it just came yesterday...}
<A>__{pause. josh enters. enid turns around.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{hi enid.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{hey josh.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{are you ready to go?}
<A>__{for a moment it's not clear who he's talking to, and then:}
<C>__{rebecca}
<P>__{(still counting receipts)}
<D>__{yeah, just one second...}
<A>__{she finishes, takes off her apron and emerges from behind the counter. she kisses josh perfunctorily.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<P>__{(to josh)}
<D>__{did you remember to pay the phone bill?}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<P>__{(to enid)}
<D>__{call me sometime.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{definitely. we still have to go to that shoe store sometime.}
<A>__{rebecca & josh leave. enid is totally alone in the now alien world of the quality cafe. a momentary pause as she calmly stares into her orange juice. we see a small, round travel bag at her feet.}
