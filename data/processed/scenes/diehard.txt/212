<L>__{174 out out 174 176 exterior police operations night}
<A>__{an unmarked police car pulls up across the street from nakatomi building and a man in a sportcoat climbs out. stocky, his hair a little too perfect, the very fact that he is the deputy chief of police operations on a christmas eve gives some evidence to his position in the pecking order. his name is dwayne t. robinson and he moves brusquely past police technicians and goes to the forward group of officers.}
<C>__{robinson}
<D>__{who's talking to them?}
<A>__{powell turns around}
<C>__{powell}
<D>__{i am, sir...sergeant al powell.}
<C>__{robinson}
<D>__{dwayne robinson. well, what have you learned? what do they want?}
<C>__{powell}

<C>__{robinson}
<P>__{(puzzled)}
<D>__{then who the hell have you been talking too?}
<C>__{powell}
<D>__{we don't exactly know, sir. he won't give us him name. he appears to be the man who called in the report...he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others.}
<C>__{robinson}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{he claims? powell, has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists, pulling your chain? or some kind of nut case who }
<C>__{powell}
<D>__{i don't think so, sir. in fact... i think he's a cop. maybe not lapd, but definitely a badge.}
<C>__{robinson}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{powell}
<D>__{a hunch. things he said. like, knowing how to recognize a phony id }
<C>__{robinson}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{ recognizing phony id's? christ, powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!}
<A>__{something draws robinson's attention. he looks at: his p.o.v. remote news truck pulling up and parking just beyond the barricades. richard thornburg gets out, starts supervising the positioning of cameras.}
