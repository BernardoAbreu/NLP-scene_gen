<A>__{it is around midnight, and there is a more settled look to the game; some of the players have removed their coats, and there is a good deal of smoke in the air. the kid has a cup of coffee by him, presumably with brandy in it; lancey has his frappe; pig is drinking whiskey; the shooter and yeller have bottles of bear. it is the end of a hand. with about six hundred dollars in the pot, pig, who has been called, turns over his hole card triumphantly.}
<C>__{pig}
<D>__{aces over eights.}
<P>__{(waits for a challenge,}
<D>__{but the others turn}
<P>__{their cards)}
<D>__{thank you, gents.}
<P>__{(as he pulls in money, to yeller)}
<D>__{be a laugh if the two champs ended up cleaned.}
<A>__{close shot lancey he barely notices pig's remark. close shot kid he barely notices lancey's reaction to pig's remark. camera moves among the spectators, who also have a more settled look about them. there is a bar, attended by a uniformed hotel bellman, and most of the people are drinking. we see in passing a couple go through the door to the bedroom and close it behind them. camera holds on the love seat as bill rejoin hoban on their perch.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{any action?}
<C>__{hoban}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{what do you expect first five or six hours?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{still feeling each other out?}
<C>__{hoban}
<D>__{pig's ahead about a grand, shooter maybe three hundred.}
<P>__{(time lapse)}
<A>__{close shot cards being dealt sokal gets a nine of clubs, the kid a six, pig a queen, yeller a king, lancey a jack, and the shooter a four.}
<C>__{shooter's voice}
<D>__{king bets.}
<A>__{camera pulls back to show the players. there is less oral accompaniment to the betting now.}
<C>__{yeller}
<D>__{king says twenty.}
<A>__{lancey calls, shooter drops, sokal calls, the kid drops.}
<C>__{pig}
<D>__{in for twenty.}
<C>__{shooter}
<P>__{(dealing)}
<D>__{to the nine a ten, to the queen a seven, to the king a jack, and to the jack a jack.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{pair of jacks will venture a hundred dollars.}
<C>__{sokal}
<P>__{(who has the nine and ten of clubs showing)}
<D>__{i'm in.}
<C>__{pig}
<P>__{(after studying the board)}
<D>__{up two hundred dollars.}
<C>__{yeller}
<P>__{(folding)}
<D>__{leave it to the rich folk.}
<A>__{two shot hoban and bill}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{lancey could be laying for him with three jacks.}
<C>__{hoban}
<D>__{pig don't think so.}
<C>__{lancey's voice }
<D>__{call the two hundred.}
<B>__{the poker table}
<A>__{lancey puts in his money and so does sokal.}
<C>__{sokal}
<D>__{i'm sticking.}
<B>__{the poker table}
<A>__{shooter deals another round: an eight of clubs to sokal, a second seven to pig, a ten to lancey.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{possible straight flush, pair of sevens. pair of jacks are still high.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{check to the sevens.}
<C>__{sokal}
<D>__{likewise.}
<C>__{pig}
<P>__{(trying to be casual)}
<D>__{bet the size of the pot. nine hundred and eighty dollars.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{in for nine eighty.}
<C>__{sokal}
<D>__{i will play.}
<A>__{two shot hoban and bill}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{what's with lancey? i thought he'd raise with three jacks or drop with two pair.}
<C>__{hoban}
<D>__{he probably thinks pig's faking the queens. anyhow, doc's liable take them both with a straight or a flush.}
<B>__{the poker table}
<A>__{there is a good deal of suspense hanging on each card as the shooter deals. sokal gets a five of diamonds, and his disappointment is too great to conceal.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{busted, no flush, no straight. pair of sevens with a queen gets a nine. to the pair of jacks, a trey.}
<C>__{pig}
<P>__{(counting his money, trying to be calm)}
<D>__{pair of sevens will bet whatever i got here. twenty four hundred bucks.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{i will call your twenty four hundred }
<A>__{close shot the kid he watches lancey, puzzled; this isn't what he had expected.}
<C>__{lancey's voice }
<D>__{ and raise you whatever i have left.}
<A>__{the kid relaxes; this is more the way he figured it.}
<B>__{the poker table}
<A>__{lancey is completely calm. pig is shattered, his whole world suddenly blown apart.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{comes to fourteen hundred fifty dollars, pig. don't imagine you'll have any problem promoting that much in half an hour plus whatever you care to raise me.}
<A>__{all eyes are on pig, which doesn't make it any easier for him. he just sits there, his hands shaking.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{fourteen fifty to the queens. you want to take your half hour, pig?}
<A>__{there is another long moment before pig flips over his up cards.}
<C>__{pig}
<D>__{no, i'm out. out of the game.}
<A>__{he looks at lancey with malevolence. lancey turns over his up cards and tosses them in front of the shooter. pig suddenly lunges toward the cards, wanting a look at lancey's hole card, but lancey is too quick for him and pushes the cards into the pack the shooter is assembling.}
<C>__{shooter}
<P>__{(to pig)}
<D>__{you tap city?}
<A>__{pig is suffering, weighing the advantages and disadvantages of making the dread admission. finally he nods. the shooter takes a ten dollar bill from his own stake, and the other four remaining players each add a ten. the shooter pushes the money toward pig.}
<C>__{pig}
<D>__{i got a woman.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{i thought you and hilda were quits.}
<C>__{pig}
<D>__{we're back.}
<A>__{the other players look at the shooter to see if he is going to accept this statement at face value. he nods, that he does, and each man contributes another ten. the shooter passes the second fifty to pig.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{see you around, pig.}
<C>__{players}
<P>__{(ad lib)}
<D>__{so long, pig see you 'night.}
<C>__{pig}
<P>__{(getting up)}
<D>__{so long.}
<A>__{camera follows him to the door. the spectators make room for him, no one saying anything. at the door, pig turns back for his valedictory gesture.}
<C>__{pig}
<D>__{good luck kid.}
<A>__{he goes out. close shot lancey he has been rearranging his money, but pig's words make his head jerk up and toward the door. camera pulls back to reveal the other players, who react in dismay to the breach of form.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{he shouldn't have said that. not after taking tap city from the table.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{his woman's been giving him a rough time. wants him to quit and go square.}
<C>__{sokal}
<D>__{at his age? crazy.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{he wants to wish anybody luck, doesn't bother me. personally, i don't figure the kid needs it.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{thanks, lancey.}
<A>__{with that, the tension is gone. but just to make sure, the shooter pushes his chair back.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{i know it's early, men, but what about taking a little break?}
