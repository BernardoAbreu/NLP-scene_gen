<T>__{cut:}
<A>__{billy still in the same position, vomits all over himself. hamidou spins the pulley to a new position bringing: billy into a steeper, more vertical position. he is on the verge of fainting, bleary eyed, looking as: hamidou moves around in between his legs. doing something indistinct with the stick between his legs, then dropping the stick. then, with this bizarrely excited expression on his hairless face, he begins to undo his own pants. but, for billy, it all blurs out to: japanese silk screen depicting a fat jovial buddhist monk, fishing placidly by a stream. then moves to soap carvings of chess pieces then a bed sheet hung as a curtain with astrological symbols paint; on it. sound off, of a blaring radio. atonal turkish music.}
<C>__{voice}
<P>__{(close, intense)}
<D>__{hey man, he's gotta walk, or his feet gonna swell up worse. 2nd voice}
<P>__{(softer, sonorous, swedish accent)}
<D>__{we take him down to courtyard...}
<A>__{then: erich a gentle long bird's face. long whitish blond hair, swedish, well above six feet, 25. another face moves into view jimmy bell, american, 23 fiery eyes, black hair and moustache, intense, strong.}
<C>__{bell}
<D>__{smoke this rocket, it'll cool the pain.}
<A>__{another angle bell puts a huge cone shaped joint with aluminium foil filter into billy's lips. he hardly knows what it is, puffing weakly. though dehydrated and his face white without color, he has no facial markings.}
<C>__{bell}
<D>__{you gotta walk around some man, or your feet gonna swell up something bad...}
<A>__{billy looks down at his feet bloated black and blue with inflamed red points in various spots. a vicious bruise on his anklebone. erich is running a cold rag from a basin of water over them, his fingers tender.}
<C>__{bell }
<D>__{you've been out for days man, talking all kinds of shit. come on, we'll walk you down to the courtyard.}
<A>__{bell eases billy up from the bed, as erich puts a pair of clip clops on his feet.}
<C>__{erich}
<D>__{okay?}
<A>__{billy nods. they rise together, bracing his shoulder. billy adjusting to the sensation of standing.}
<C>__{erich}
<D>__{how's it feel?}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(dizzy)}
<D>__{about as good as it looks.}
<C>__{bell}
<D>__{getchmis olsun}

<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{just erich.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{i'm billy hayes... at least i used to be.}
<A>__{looks around. a dormitory type room with 24 bunk beds set head to head in horizontal fashion, cramped and with minimal privacy. a narrow walkway leading towards a toilet area and staircase.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{looks like a cheap hotel.}
<C>__{bell}
<D>__{yeah... only the room service is lousy. come on, let me show you the tennis courts.}
<A>__{helps him with erich to take the first steps. the courtyard. the three of them emerge in a thin afternoon sun, billy now disengaging and hobbling on his own power.}
<C>__{erich}
<P>__{(watching billy limp)}
<D>__{feeling all right?}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(still groggy)}
<D>__{yeah. that guy who beat me?}

<D>__{i feel stoned.}
<C>__{bell}
<P>__{(grins, interjects)}
<D>__{'figgers.}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(vague, going on)}
<D>__{...he had a bald skull and...}
<C>__{bell}
<D>__{hamidou. chief of the guards. don't fuck with him. he almost killed an italian dude couple months ago. bad news. he try anything with you?}

<C>__{billy}
<D>__{no... i don't remember.}
<A>__{glances at erich.}
<C>__{bell}
<D>__{with these fucking turks, soon as the light goes out... i keep one hand on their feet and their feet better not grow. you'll meet max. he got raped something bad down in section 13. that's the pits.}
<B>__{the courtyard}
<A>__{various angles the yard is 30 by 50 paces with a wall 20 feet high. cigarette butts, orange peels crumpled news papers, rocks, sticks, broken glass litter the place. no guards are on the walls; the only guards are unarmed inanimate lumps of boredom who look as helpless as the prisoners with whom they intermingle; they have raggedy olive green uniforms and worn boots (they make $1 a month, augmented by bribes). on one side of the yard is a 2 story rogus (cellblock) with barred windows from which billy and his two companions have just emerged. on the other side of the yard is another 2 story kogus (the children's kogus). the courtyard is colorful, almost like a bazaar, about 8o people in it groups of exotically dressed africans, afghans, arabs, malaysians, europeans, and predominantly turks pacing back and forth talking in little circles, hawking wares, trading illegal currencies. screaming turkish street urchins 10 14 years old, share the space playing soccer and volleyball with a surprising viciousness, continually hitting each other and cursing. a bunch of them vehemently lay bets on the soccer game. other aspects of the prison which should become evident:}
