<L>__{interior kane's office late day }
<A>__{kane, in his shirt sleeves, at a roll top desk in the sanctum, is working feverishly on copy and eating a very sizeable meal at the same time. carter, still formally coated, is seated alongside him. leland, seated in a corner, is looking on, detached, amused. the furniture has been pushed around and kane's effects are somewhat in place. on a corner of the desk, bernstein is writing down figures. no one pays any attention to him.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{i'm not criticizing, mr. carter, but here's what i mean. there's a front page story in the "chronicle,"}
<P>__{(points to it)}
<D>__{and a picture of a woman in brooklyn who is missing. probably murdered.}
<P>__{(looks to make sure of the name)}
<D>__{a mrs. harry silverstone. why didn't the "enquirer" have that this morning?}
<C>__{carter}
<P>__{(stiffly)}
<D>__{because we're running a newspaper, mr. kane, not a scandal sheet.}
<A>__{kane has finished eating. he pushes away his plates.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{i'm still hungry, brad. let's go to rector's and get something decent.}
<P>__{(pointing to the}
<D>__{"chronicle" before}
<P>__{him)}
<D>__{the "chronicle" has a two column headline, mr. carter. why haven't we?}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{there is no news big enough.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{if the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough. the murder of mrs. harry silverstone }
<C>__{carter}
<P>__{(hotly)}
<D>__{as a matter of fact, we sent a man to the silverstone home yesterday afternoon.}
<P>__{(triumphantly)}
<D>__{our man even arrived before the "chronicle" reporter. and there's no proof that the woman was murdered or even that she's dead.}
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(smiling a bit)}
<D>__{the "chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, mr. carter. it says the neighbors are getting suspicious.}
<C>__{carter}
<P>__{(stiffly)}
<D>__{it's not our function to report the gossip of housewives. if we were interested in that kind of thing, mr. kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily }
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{that's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, mr. carter. right now, i wish you'd send your best man up to see mr. silverstone. have him tell mr. silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "enquirer" will have him arrested.}
<P>__{(he gets an idea)}
<D>__{have him tell mr. silverstone he's a detective from the central office. if mr. silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call mr. silverstone an anarchist.}
<A>__{loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{really, mr. kane, i can't see the function of a respectable newspaper }
<A>__{kane isn't listening to him.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{oh, mr. bernstein!}
<A>__{bernstein looks up from his figures.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{i've just made a shocking discovery. the "enquirer" is without a telephone. have two installed at once!}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{i ordered six already this morning! got a discount!}
<A>__{kane looks at leland with a fond nod of his head at bernstein. leland grins back. mr. carter, meantime, has risen stiffly.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{but, mr. kane }
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{that'll be all today, mr. carter. you've been most understanding. good day, mr. carter!}
<A>__{carter, with a look that runs just short of apoplexy, leaves the room, closing the door behind him.}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{poor mr. carter!}
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{what makes those fellows think that a newspaper is something rigid, something inflexible, that people are supposed to pay two cents for }
<C>__{bernstein}
<P>__{(without looking up)}
<D>__{three cents.}
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{two cents.}
<A>__{bernstein lifts his head and looks at kane. kane gazes back at him.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<P>__{(tapping on the paper)}
<D>__{this is all figured at three cents a copy.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{re figure it, mr. bernstein, at two cents.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<P>__{(sighs and puts papers in his pocket)}
<D>__{all right, but i will keep these figures, too, just in case.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{ready for dinner, brad?}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{mr. leland, if mr. kane, he should decide to drop the price to one cent, or maybe even he should make up his mind to give the paper away with a half pound of tea you'll just hold him until i get back, won't you?}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{i'm not guaranteeing a thing, mr. bernstein. you people work too fast for me! talk about new brooms!}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{who said anything about brooms?}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{it's a saying, mr. bernstein. a new broom sweeps clean.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{oh!}
