<L>__{interior studio}
<A>__{jerry lewis need not fear. this is strictly a tin foil and crepe paper operation. along one wall is the "phone bank," monitored by a few sleepy volunteers, and opposite, in makeshift bleachers, is the audience. a huge tote board, set on rolling astors, is next to the phones. the total, at 2:15 am, is $1125.38. as jack and frank enter, the kid in the wheelchair is doing basketball tricks before the camera.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{this must be it. i will see when we're on.}
<A>__{frank leaves. jack glances around the studio like he's walked into a nightmare. at the phone bank, a heavyset man in a sweatshirt and a cap, looks over. both the sweatshirt and the cap have "earl" printed on them.}
<C>__{earl }
<D>__{you the magician?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{earl}
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{oh. what do you do?}
<A>__{jack points to the pianos across the room.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{piano.}
<C>__{earl}
<P>__{(hopeful)}
<D>__{two at a time?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{my brother and i. one each.}
<C>__{earl}
<P>__{(disappointed again)}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(indicating the kid in the wheelchair)}
<D>__{what's wrong with the kid?}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{knee. tore it up against st. anthony's. right before the accident.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{accident?}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{the fire. the way we're going we'll be lucky to buy a carton of jockstraps, let alone a new gym. as jack registers this, earl's phone rings. frank returns and gestures to the kid in the wheelchair.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{we're on after meadowlark.}
<P>__{(seeing jack's face)}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{are you kidding me? are you fucking kidding me?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{we're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{before jack can further enlighten frank, the kid in the wheelchair rolls off and a guy in a cheap rented tux strides in front of the camera. he's vince nancy, the host.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{let's hear it for our own jimmy marshall, shall we?}
<A>__{the audience applauds.}
<C>__{vince}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{as most of you'know, young jimmy put a nasty twist on that knee trying to win one for good ol' grant high this year. luckily, the doctors tell us jimmy'll be able to play next season. that is ... if there is a next season.}
<P>__{(uncle sam)}
<D>__{that's where you come in. pick up that phone. make a donation. let's keep our kids off the streets and in the gym where they belong.}
<A>__{applause.}
<C>__{vince}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{all right. well, friends, what can i say about our next guest?}
<P>__{(consulting a card)}
<D>__{he, uh, they, uh, we are very pleased to have with us two of the most respected men in the musical entertainment field. i think you'll agree with me when i tell you we're in for a real treat when i say that we have with us ... the fabulous bunker boys! come on out here guys.}
<A>__{vince gestures grandly to the left and jack and frank enter from the right.}
<C>__{vince}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{whoops, there they are. hey, nice suits, fellas.}
<P>__{(to camera)}
<D>__{now i know a lot of you amateur musicians out there are going to want to rap with these guys and don't worry. right after they finish up here, they're going to be manning the phones. maybe we can even convince them to raffle off a few piano lessons if we're lucky. what do you think?}
<A>__{the audience applauds. jack glares at frank. he shrugs.}
<C>__{vince}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{well, all right then. what are we waiting for? take it away, guys.}
<A>__{jack and frank poise their hands over their pianos and begin to play. as the music rises, the studio becomes very quiet, almost still. unfortunately, jack and frank are barely through the opening passage when a thunderously loud bell begins to ring. suddenly, vince steps out again.}
<C>__{vince}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{uh oh. we know what that means, don't we? it's time to turn the board over.}
<P>__{(to jack, frank)}
<D>__{i'm afraid you fellas'll just have to wait a minute. let's bring out the board.}
<A>__{two post pubescent giants roll out the tote board right in front of jack and frank. jack looks positively homicidal.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{jack ...}
<A>__{jack kicks out the piano bench and starts to leave. then, seeing the kid in the wheelchair, he grabs the basketball and fires it at vince.}
<C>__{vince}
<D>__{what the }
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{you're a fucking creep, you know that. i oughta kick your ass.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{jack, you're on television.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{shut up, frank.}
<A>__{earl of the sweatshirt and cap puts his hand on jack's shoulder.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{what do you say we go for a walk, pal.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{get your hand off me.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{come on, friend. i can smell it on you. get yourself a cup of coffee. you'll forget what you're angry about.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{go fuck yourself.}
<C>__{earl}
<P>__{(eyes go hard)}
<D>__{you're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, ace?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i don't see any ladies here. except maybe you.}
<A>__{that does it. earl takes hold of jack's collar and starts to wrestle him roughly toward the door.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{hey, leave him alone.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{do your brother a favor and have his mouth sewn up.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you're a lousy dancer, earl. don't you know the man's supposed to lead?}
<A>__{earl shoves jack into the hallway, hard. jack stumbles back against the wall.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{who do you think you are, asshole? liberace?}
