<L>__{interior sean's office day}
<A>__{sean's office is comfortable. books are stacked against the wall. there is a painting on the wall behind sean. sean is seated behind a desk. lambeau sits in a chair in the back of the room, next to tom. a long beat passes, they wait.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{any vulnerability he senses, he'll exploit.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{i will be okay.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{it's a poker game with this young man. don't let him see what you've got.}

<C>__{sean}
<D>__{would you excuse us?}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{tom.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{you too, gerry.}
<A>__{lambeau looks at sean, surprised. sean's stare is unwavering. after an awkward moment, lambeau goes, leaving sean and will alone. will doesn't look at sean for more than a second. he seems more interested in the room. there is a long silence as sean watches will.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{hello, will. i'm sean maguire.}
<A>__{a smile crosses will's face as he walks to his chair and sits. he lights a cigarette. sean continues to watch him. finally }
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{where are you from in southie?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{did you buy all these books retail, or do you send away for like a "shrink kit" that comes with all these volumes included?}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{have you read all these books, will?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{probably not.}
<C>__{sean}
<P>__{(indicating a shelf)}
<D>__{how about the ones on that shelf?}
<A>__{will's eyes flicker up to the shelf for an instant.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{yeah, i read those.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{what did you think?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i'm not here for a fuckin' book report. they're your books, why don't you read 'em?}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{i did.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{that must have taken you a long time.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{yeah, it did take me a long time.}
<A>__{sean says this with pride. his determined stare and confident manner catch will a bit off guard. will rises from his chair and goes to the shelf.}
<C>__{will}
<P>__{(looking at book)}
<D>__{"a history of the united states, volume i." if you want to read a real history book, read howard zinn's "a people's history of the united states." that book will knock you on your ass.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{how about noam chomsky's "manufacturing consent?"}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you people baffle me. you spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books and they're the wrong fuckin' books.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{you think so?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{whatever blows your hair back.}
<A>__{will returns to his chair. pause.}
<C>__{sean}
<P>__{(indicating cigarette)}
<D>__{guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. stunt your growth.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you're right. it really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.}
<A>__{sean does not seem at all affected by will's attitude. he remains behind the big desk with almost half a smile on his face. will is aware of sean's confidence.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{do you lift?}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{yes, i do.}
<C>__{will}

<D>__{oh yeah? me too. what do you bench?}
<C>__{sean}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{will gets up again and moves around his chair to sean's painting. it is a picture of an old sailboat in a tremendous storm by no means a masterpiece. will studies it.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you paint this?}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{yeah. do you paint?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{crayons?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{this is a real piece of shit.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{tell me what you really think.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{poor color composition, lousy use of space. but that shit doesn't really concern me.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{what does?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{the color here, see how dark it is? it's interesting.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{what is?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{oh, "starry night" time, huh?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep" }
<C>__{will}
<D>__{ well, maybe that means you.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{maybe what mea }
<C>__{will}
<D>__{maybe you were in the middle of a storm, a big fuckin' storm the waves were crashing over the bow, the goddamned mast was about to snap, and you were crying for the harbor. so you did what you had to do, to get out. maybe you became a psychologist.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{maybe you should be a patient and sit down.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{maybe you married the wrong woman.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{watch your mouth.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{that's it isn't it? you married the wrong woman. she leave you? was she bangin' someone else?}
<A>__{sean is walking slowly towards will.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{how are the seas now, d }
<A>__{in a flash, sean has will by the throat. will is helpless.}
<C>__{sean}
