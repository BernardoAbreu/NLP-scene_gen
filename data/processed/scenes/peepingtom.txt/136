<A>__{mrs. stephens is leaning against the wall... she has dropped her heavy stick. it lies on the floor a few feet away from her. mark is kneeling in front of her the tripod firmly on the floor. the cine camera is pointing upwards into her face. he peers excitedly into the viewfinder.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{please let me finish! it's for helen!}
<A>__{she edges towards her stick. he hurries forward and picks it up. he looks at the spike on the end of it then carefully gives it to her by the handle. she grasps it tightly.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{what do you mean? it's for helen?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{she wants to see something i've photographed!}
<A>__{he returns excitedly to his camera.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{my daughter sees enough of my face without photographs...}
<A>__{on mark's focusing screen we see the fear on her face. her hand trembles as she wipes away the perspiration.}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{please... don't be frightened.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{not frightened! hot!}
<A>__{but it is fear that we are looking at.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{so put that camera away...}
<A>__{on the focusing screen we see her moisten her lips nervously.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yes!}
<A>__{he switches off the camera abruptly, and folds up the tripod. he turns away without looking at her and hurries to the door. close shot of mrs. stephens listening to his movements puzzled.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{in rather a hurry, aren't you?}
<A>__{he glances towards her. from his pov we see the fear in her eyes. he looks away at once, staring into the darkened room.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{it's late.}
<A>__{from her pov (shooting over her shoulder with a large close shot of her ear in the foreground) we see mark standing in the doorway and hear, very clearly, his quick, uneasy breathing.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you must be tired...}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{you're anxious to get rid of me all of a sudden.}
<A>__{we hear his quick intake of breath.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{i won't be selfish... you can take some more pictures if you want to...}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{no... thank you.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{why not, mark?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{run out of film.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{can't you find some to please helen?}
<A>__{he glances towards her then hurries into the next room.}
<C>__{mrs. stephens}
<D>__{you don't trust yourself to take any more, do you?}
