<L>__{interior hall of the north american mammals night}
<A>__{pendergast looks desperately at the blueprints.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{is there another way around?}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{no. the planetarium is in the next cell. this is one of the fire doors...}
<A>__{pendergast returns to the window.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{vince? there's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. there's an entrance to the sub basement in the hall off the north side exit.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{the sub basement?}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{i've been down there. it links up to the old sewer system. i can guide you out.}
<A>__{d'agosta turns to the others.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{how much ammo do we have to make a stand?}
<C>__{kawakita}
<D>__{you're asking me? i don't even know how to load this thing.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{four rounds...}
<A>__{there's a movement of air... and a ripe, fetid smell.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{oh shit.}
<A>__{d'agosta pumps his shot gun.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{i smell it. it's here.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{go out the north exit! there's a hallway and a false wall by the greek vases. run!}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{everybody. get behind me.}
<A>__{the others move past. d'agosta, frank and greg kawakita hold the rear. the group runs to the side exit to the planetarium and in a moment, disappears.}
