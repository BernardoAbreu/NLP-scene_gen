<L>__{exterior interstate hwy shoulder day}
<A>__{john sees the big rig truck driver look back from where he's pulled over. john nods to him that everything is okay and comes around the bumper to find lara sitting on the gravel shoulder, leaning against the back tire, staring out at the field beyond. he sits beside her in silence. behind them the cars whip by. no one even thinks to stop to see if they need help. lara and john watch a cow in the farmer's field. there is nothing for either of them to say, they both know how they got here. their hands sit on the gravel between each other. without looking at him, lara tentatively entwines a single finger with his. he slowly gathers strength from her touch.}
