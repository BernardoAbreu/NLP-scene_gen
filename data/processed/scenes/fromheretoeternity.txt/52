<L>__{interior new congress club large club room night}
<B>__{full shot}
<A>__{several rooms branch off from this main one. there are about a dozen soldiers in civilian clothes and about a dozen hostesses. several couples are dancing. the man at the piano is banging away, his music clashing cacophonically with a jukebox record from an adjoining room. camera pans as mrs. kipfer moves to and fro encouraging the men to enjoy themselves. the new congress is a sort of primitive u.s.o., a place of well worn merriment. it is not a house of prostitution but the girls look available for goosing... all but one we see at the end of the pan. she sits alone on a couch. this is lorene. there is an innocent, child like look about her. her hair is done demurely in a circular roll low on her neck. she is about twenty four. she is reading a magazine, untouched by the din around her. medium close shot sergeant "fatso" judson pounding the piano as if he is trying to knock the keys out. he has an enormous head and a hogshead chest. he resembles porky pig. his dead eyes look like two beads of caviar spaced far apart on a great white plate.}
<B>__{medium shot near curtains to vestibule}
<A>__{maggio is attempting some serious dancing with sandra, a very tall girl. fatso's furious tempo and tune keep drowning the langorous tango coming from the jukebox. maggio keeps switching his style as he tries to get out of the range of the piano but cannot. he is very annoyed. he and sandra dance out of shot, as prew and annette enter from the vestibule. camera pans them to a trio of girls on a couch.}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{... girls, here's some new poison. this is billy and jean and nancy.}
<A>__{the girls smile, ad lib hellos. prew is looking over the girls' heads at someone in rear of room out of shot. medium shot lorene from prew's pov as if she senses someone is staring at her, she looks up from the magazine, smiles serenely across the room.}
<B>__{medium shot featuring prew and annette}
<A>__{as she reacts sourly to prew's reaction to lorene. he seems transfixed.}
<C>__{annette}

<C>__{annette}

<D>__{much as i adore your company, you must allow me to tear myself away. i see a few friends at the door.}
<P>__{(snaps)}

<A>__{she walks off. the other girls resume talking to the soldier. prew continues to gaze across the room.}
<B>__{medium close shot lorene}
