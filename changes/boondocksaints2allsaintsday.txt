<ACTION>__{All following visuals in slo-mo with slamming music... Poppa "M" stands, throwing open his trench and revealing his leather vest, a six gun rig in the front. The Roman in awe. The double doors crash in and men barrel through as Poppa M turns, pulls two weapons and fires upon them, hitting one. The boys crash through the glass ceiling of the greenhouse on either side of Poppa M. They fire as they fall, hit the ground and roll. Romeo bursts into the fray from inside the house, blasting away with his gold .45's, a shotgun hanging on his back. The garden is being torn apart as the brothers, Poppa M and Romeo hit their marks and the hit squad returns fire. The boys dive behind fountains which are then pulverized. The gun battle rages around the Roman who remains seated in the very mouth of madness. His heart breaks as his sanctuary is shredded. Romeo fires as a large rack of wine behind him is torn apart. Murphy fires over a statue and bodies crash into the pool. Connor stands, firing in a Jesus Christ pose. Poppa M drops his empty weapons and pulls two more, laying down a second barrage. Romeo is simultaneously hit in the leg and shoulder. He falls, dropping his .45s. He struggles to fire the shotgun. Poppa M takes one in the chest. Connor is wounded in the shoulder but continues firing. Murphy is hit in the leg but continues firing. The boys and Romeo manage to take out the last of the Thugs, who are blasted into the Turkish pool. It is over. The music fades...}
