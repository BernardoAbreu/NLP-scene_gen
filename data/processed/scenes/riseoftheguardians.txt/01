<L>__{exterior frozen pond night}
<A>__{snow covered trees in every direction. the ice in the pond continues to crack, until finally a hole splinters open. a young man floats out of the water, bathed in the intense moonlight. this is jack frost thin, pale, barefoot, his tousled hair frosted white.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{but then...then i saw the moon. it was so big and it was so bright, and it seemed to chase the darkness away. and when it did...i wasn't scared anymore.}
<A>__{jack floats back down onto the ice as the hole closes up underneath him.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{why i was there, and what i was meant to do that i've never known. and a part of me wonders if i ever will.}
<A>__{jack looks around, confused, then turns toward the moonlight as it dims a bit. jack carefully treads across the ice until he hits something with his feet. he looks down, and at his feet is a wooden staff. curious, he picks it up. almost immediately the staff begins to glow a cold blue in his hands. odd.}

<A>__{jack almost drops it as the base of the staff comes in contact with the ground. frost shoots out and spreads across the ice. jack is visibly confused. he touches a few trees with his staff sending frost up their trunks. then he swings the staff again, more confident, as he begins to run across the frozen pond. another swing, and a gust of wind swirls him high up into the air. jack floats for a moment only to fall back down to earth and into the trees. jack grabs hold of a tree branch and pulls himself up to see a small town off in the distance.}
