<A>__{the lighted ferris wheel spins center frame. we crane down and eventually land on a side street with the amusement park looming in the b.g. we're in front of a small building. the half lit neon sign reads: coney island methadone center. we drift through the double doors through the reception area where random junkies loiter and fill out paperwork. we continue down a narrow hallway as the faint sound of someone singing and playing the guitar increases. we finally burst through another set of doors marked "treatment room." the singing now fills our ears as we push in on the "performer" a big, puffy, orange rhinoceros. smoochy. or to be more specific, sheldon mopes. smoochy sits on a stool with his guitar and sings to the patients as they stand in line before a sliding glass window, where a nurse hands each person a little cup of methadone which they immediately drink. the smoochy costume is a mass of misshapen orange foam rubber that exposes sheldon's painted face in the front. a multi colored horn protrudes from his forehead.}
