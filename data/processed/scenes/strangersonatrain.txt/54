<D>__{well, we'd better be getting back.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{we've actually been alone for an hour. seems almost indecent. you like?}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(softly)}

<C>__{anne}
<D>__{we'll be happier then, won't we?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i suppose so.}
<A>__{anne looks it him, surprised at his lack of enthusiasm. they walk on out of the picture. a figure steps out from behind a pillar in the main hall of the gallery, near the spot from which they have disappeared. it is bruno. he calls.}
<C>__{bruno}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{guy!}
<A>__{anne stops and looks back. guy knows who it is and would not turn but that he is forced to by anne's action. he takes a few steps towards bruno.}
