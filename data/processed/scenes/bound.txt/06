<A>__{a dirty bar hidden away on a dark street, its cracked, moon white sign the only evidence it exists. corky's truck swings into a space in front of a couple of large motorcycles. she flips her collar and heads for the door.}

<A>__{the smell of leather and cigarette smoke fills corky's nose as she crosses to the bar.}

<A>__{corky gets off the stool.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{thanks for the beer.}
<A>__{looking around, she sees a woman alone at one of the back tables. through the smoky din, she bears a slight resemblance to violet. the woman is dressed all in black, including a leather jacket. smiling, corky slides into the chair beside her. there is no one smoother.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{you know ... that outfit would look great on my bedroom floor.}
<A>__{the woman smiles just as someone taps corky on the shoulder. she turns and is face to face with a large bull of a woman in a heavy leather chicago police jacket. she is more wide than fat.}
<C>__{woman cop}
<D>__{hey, jesse. what's happening here?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{nothing ... yet.}
<C>__{woman cop}
<D>__{who's this?}
<A>__{her coat opens as she puts her hands on her hips. a service revolver is clipped to her belt. she squints at corky, her head nodding in recognition.}
<C>__{woman cop}
<D>__{wait, i know you.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{woman cop}
<D>__{i didn't know you were out.}

<C>__{corky}
