<A>__{viktor speaks again, his voice suddenly deeper.}
<D>__{simone viktor thank... you, frank.}
<A>__{in horror viktor hurriedly pulls the plug. the feed goes blank on frank brand's screen. viktor slumps over his computer in exhaustion. since simone is still synced to his movements, the partially de pixelated simone also slumps. viktor's cell phone rings. viktor picks up.}
<D>__{viktor simone hel }
<A>__{he remembers at the last second to switch off his voice synthesizer.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{hello.}
