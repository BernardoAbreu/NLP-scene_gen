<A>__{dancers jitterbugging and jiving. among them, david and emmi also dancing, imitating the others and having a good time. the music ends. scattered applause. the band leaves the platform. the dancers return to tables or the bar. later: david and emmi at their table, eating. she eats voraciously, eyes glazed, all her concentration on the food in front of her. david is fascinated, can't stop watching her. steve enters the club, makes his way to the bar, orders a drink. steve turns to survey the room, almost at once spots david and emmi, their backs to him. he observes them. david and emmi at their table: they have finished their meal. emmi is silent now, staring at her empty plate. steve is suddenly at their table.}
