<L>__{exterior rear of doc's office}
<A>__{an old fashioned hearse, with plate glass sides and elaborate lead candelabra doc's "limousine" is parked a few steps from the door. macreedy climbs in behind the wheel as doc comes out and stands on the small back porch. macreedy turns on the ignition switch. his foot kicks over the starter, but the spark doesn't catch. he tries again, then again. he pauses, frowns, as doc comes down from the porch and joins him.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(concentrating on the dashboard)}
<D>__{won't start.}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(nervously, to macreedy)}
<D>__{something wrong?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{just won't start...}
<A>__{again he presses the ignition switch. nothing. and suddenly, in b.g., the great bulk of hector david looms up, leaning against the porch pillar at the corner of the alleyway. his expression is almost dreamy. for a moment he stands there while macreedy toys with the ignition and the sick engine wheezes and grinds. then he ambles up to the hearse...}
<C>__{hector}
<P>__{(gratuitously)}
<D>__{could be the wirin'. why don't you look under the hood?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{for that i thank you.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{how much time you think i've got before...?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{they'll wait at least till dark.}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{they'd be afraid to see each other's faces.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(slapping doc's shoulder lightly)}
<D>__{well, so long, doc. i can't say it's been charming but...}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{i don't know. but i'm going on foot.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{that's no good. you stray ten yards off main street, and you'll be stone, cold dead.}
<P>__{(offers macreedy a cigarette)}
<D>__{that's the situation, in a nut.}
<A>__{macreedy takes the cigarette, lighting a match with one hand. he puts the fire to doc's smoke and then lights his own. he inhales, exhales, thinking. finally... macreedy gets out of the car. hector has already opened the hood. doc peers nervously over his shoulder. as they study the engine, hector's horsey face appears behind them. he gestures toward the engine. insert the engine focal point: a hopeless snarl of ignition wires.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{it's the wirin', like i said. now wasn't that a good guess?}
<A>__{slowly he takes off his wrist watch and puts it in his pants pocket.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{it can be fixed.}
<A>__{ignoring hector, he bends over the engine, controlling his obvious awareness that hector has fouled up the ignition.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{easy. unless, of course, this here wire...}
<P>__{(reaching inside the hood, pointing)}
<D>__{...got broke or something.}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(suddenly, heatedly, turning on hector)}
<D>__{do the nice little things, like keep your big fat nose out of my business.}
<A>__{hector's eyes go hard. he reaches out suddenly, one great hand closing over the distributor cap. he yanks, ripping the feed wires out of their sockets.}
<C>__{hector}
<P>__{(triumphantly, holding up the wires)}
<D>__{yep. it's the wirin'.}
<A>__{still gripping the wires, he walks off. doc simmers down. he turns to face macreedy, who hasn't moved. now macreedy slowly lowers the hood of the car.}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(softly, after a beat)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, son. you got to admit, i tried.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(as if to himself)}
<D>__{maybe...}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{maybe what?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{if i can't get out of town, maybe i can get the state cops in.}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(irritably)}
<D>__{you tried the phone, didn't you? you know what happened, don't you?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{there's another way. i will be seeing you, doc.}
<A>__{he walks off. doc looks after him grimly.}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{i hope you'll be seeing me.}
