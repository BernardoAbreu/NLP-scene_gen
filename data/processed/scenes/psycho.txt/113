<L>__{exterior the motel porch (night)}
<A>__{norman walks down the porch, hesitates before cabin one, walks on a bit toward cabin two, stops, turns to see if arbogast is following. arbogast has come out onto the porch, but is not following. he has walked to the opposite end of the porch and is standing at its edge, looking up at the old house. the upstairs window is in darkness. the neon of the vacancy and motel signs splash strange light over the scene.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{change your mind?}
<A>__{arbogast does not reply. norman becomes apprehensive, starts to arbogast, forcing himself to remain calm and cheerful.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i guess i've got one of those faces you can't help believing.}
<C>__{arbogast}
<P>__{(to norman, but}
<D>__{continuing to stare}
<P>__{at the house)}
<D>__{anyone at home?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i live there. alone.}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{someone is sitting in that window.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{my mother.}
<A>__{arbogast turns, gazes seriously at him.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{she's... ill. confined to her room. it's practically living alone.}
<C>__{arbogast}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{if this girl mary crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{of course not.}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{if she paid you well?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{now, look...!}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. wouldn't you?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i'm not a fool! and i'm not capable of being fooled! not even by women!}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{i didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(disturbed now)}
<D>__{that's all right. maybe she could have fooled me. but...}
<P>__{(a rueful smile)}
<D>__{she didn't fool my mother.}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{your mother met her?}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{can i talk to your mother?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{no. i told you, she's confined...}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{just for a moment. she might have picked up a hint you'd miss.}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{sick old women are sharp. come on, i won't disturb...}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{no! just no! i have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and i'm near it. there's just so much pushing i can take and i think...}
<C>__{arbogast}
<D>__{all right!}
<P>__{(starts away, toward his car, pauses)}
<D>__{might save me a lot of leg work if i could just talk to your mother. but i'd need a warrant for that, won't i?}
<A>__{norman does not respond. arbogast gets in his car, starts the motor. norman looks up, studies the man's face, his own face showing apprehension. arbogast backs the car around very slowly, his gaze divided between the old house and the lighted window of cabin two. as he turns the car out, his headlights light up the porch. norman stands, watching him drive away.}
