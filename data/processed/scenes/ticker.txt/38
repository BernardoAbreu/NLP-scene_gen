<L>__{exterior street late afternoon}
<A>__{reilly runs out into the middle of the street. at the end of the block, earring is rushing for the corner. reilly draws his 9mm, aims thru the pedestrian and fires. earring is blown off his feet... he hits the pavement hard...}
<L>__{interior bar}
<A>__{reilly enters and sees glass, tj and pooch gathered around the booth in back.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{say, thanks for the back up }
<A>__{the bomb squad ignores reilly, who now realizes something is wrong. he pushes his way through the bar patrons to the booth. glass glances up at reilly.}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{he set one, the son of a...}
<A>__{tj and pooch exchange looks they've never heard glass so close to swearing before. t.j. notices a small crowd starting to gather around the booth.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{clear the area, please.}
<A>__{nobody moves.}
<C>__{reilly}
<P>__{(loudly)}
<D>__{you heard him, get the fuck away, it's a bomb!}
<A>__{that does it, the crowds shriek and scatter. rolling eyes at each other, the bomb squaders turn their attention to the shopping bag sitting on the floor.}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{alright. let's assess.}
<A>__{the team eyes the package for a moment... glass makes a determination, whips out a knife, slashes the bag open, revealing a computerized nightmare of a bomb inside. t.j. rubs his temples with dread.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{ira.}
<A>__{glass puts on his magnifying spectacles, starts to probe. reilly returns. pooch tests hinges with his tweezers. t.j. hands glass a crimp. pooch pries off a back panel, fingers shaking, lifts it every so slightly, sees complex circuitry inside, the red glow of a digital readout counting down.}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{oh shit...}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{fuck factor ten.}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{okay, i'm going in, nobody breathe.}
<A>__{synchronizing his chronometer to the counter, glass begins disengaging sensor switches.}
<C>__{glass }
<D>__{altimeter... choking coil... mercury switch...}
<A>__{he clips off circuits and booby traps with bloodcurdling care, peeling away layer after layer of death... shakes his head with awe, respect, fear.}
<C>__{glass }
<D>__{triple v.o.m... brilliant... this guy's a master...}
<A>__{finally he comes to the heart of the bomb, a pair of tiny wires leading to the blasting cap, one yellow, one red. precious seconds tick away.}
<C>__{glass }
<D>__{it's one of these wires.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{so cut both.}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{one shuts it down, one turns arms it.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{which one's which?}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{i don't know. there's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.}
<A>__{reilly gulps. the device teeters, slightly, alarming t.j. and pooch. glass nods. t.j. and pooch each grab a corner of the device to steady it. reilly follows their lead and kneels, goes to reach for a corner as well, one hand starts to tremble.}
<C>__{glass }
<D>__{you can go back to the van if you like.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{no, i'm with you.}
<A>__{reilly focuses and wills his hands to steady. he grabs a corner and closes his eyes, mind over matter. sweat streams as he concentrates like never before. pooch and t.j. stare at the wires with intensity.}
