<L>__{interior stargher's world the den}
<A>__{eyelids rise and flutter. novak becomes conscious. and instantly realizes what's happened. he lies on the pedestal, face up, spread eagle, his wrists and ankles bound to the cold stone surface with leathery cords. standing over him, in a pool of light, is stargher king. wearing what could be seen as ceremonial garb, a silent, solemn stargher king prepares himself for execution of a ritual by polishing and arranging an assortment of shiny, sharp, macabre tools. novak shuts his eyes and silently tells himself, not real. he opens them, breathes deeply and focuses on catherine.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{you're catherine young. you majored in psych at uc san diego. you work for sunerset industries.}
<A>__{stargher king's fingers pass over an array of horrific instruments the throat piercer collar mechanism, a cleaver knife, a misshapen hammer, a long slender needle...}
<C>__{novak }
<D>__{your grandmother raised you after your parents died in a car crash...}
<A>__{stargher king lifts the blade like needle. so far, catherine looks at novak like he's speaking gibberish.}
<C>__{novak }
<D>__{when you were twenty one, you were arrested for possession and got off with community service.}
<A>__{stargher king slices through novak's clothes, exposing the flesh of his abdomen.}
<C>__{novak }
<P>__{(reminding himself)}
<D>__{not real, pete...this is not real...}
<P>__{(urgency)}
<D>__{you had to work at a center for abused kids for three months. you stayed on two years for no pay. you give half your fucking salary to the nursing home your grandmother stays at...}
<A>__{stargher king grabs his throat and traces the blade down the center of novak's torso. novak struggles and pleads with catherine.}
<C>__{novak }
<D>__{i know this because i work for the fbi. peter novak, remember?!?!}
<P>__{(a desperate request)}
<D>__{remember. you are cath }
<A>__{stargher king cuts his flesh and inserts the needle into his stomach. novak screams! this fucking hurts!}
<C>__{novak }
<D>__{help me!!!}
<A>__{stargher king wiggles the needle, pulls it out, and digs his finger into the wound. novak cries in pain.}
<C>__{novak }
<P>__{(tears forming, horrified)}
<D>__{fucking feels real!}
<A>__{the intensity of novak's cries hit catherine like a thunderbolt. there's a glimmer of life, of recognition in her eyes.}
<C>__{stargher king}
<P>__{(finally speaking)}
<D>__{me god gut you like a dear.}
<A>__{although we don't see it, we hear something awful. like stargher king fishing around inside the wound. a pale, sweating novak tries to stay conscious. he will not go into shock...}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{not real. not real. not real.}
<A>__{a female hand grabs the tool from the tray.}
<C>__{stargher king}
<P>__{(mimicking novak, laughing)}
<D>__{nod reel, nod reel, nod reel...}
<A>__{stargher king is slammed from behind! catherine rams the thing through his throat! as stargher king stumbles away gagging, blood pouring form his neck, we see that she has returned to normal. the "bride" persona is gone. as stargher king emits animalistic growls, catherine turns and sees an intact novak standing next to her. as if nothing had happened. catherine and novak run out of the den, into the tunnel from which novak gained access. he stops, ready to press the sensor, when a flicker of light dances across catherine's face.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{wait...}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{like hell "wait."}
<A>__{but she won't listen and he's forced to play catch up as she moves further from the den toward the cliff face. the flicker of light shines on the entrance to a specific tunnel.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{he wants us to follow. the little boy...}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{little boy?! that's him!}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{he brought you to me, didn't he? if you want julia to live, trust me. trust him.}
