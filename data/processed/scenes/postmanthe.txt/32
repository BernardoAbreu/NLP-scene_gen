<L>__{exterior river day}
<A>__{a fallen tree spans the river. as the postman is swept beneath, he reaches up and catches hold. pulling himself out of the water, he scrambles for the west shore. he disappears into the woods as two soldiers appear. they catch hold of the tree, look to the west banking, see footprints in the mud where the postman pulled himself out. they start after him.}
<L>__{exterior clearing woods day}
<A>__{clothes in tatters, his lungs ready to burst, the postman stops. he takes cover as the two soldiers run past. breathing hard, the postman steps out, starts across the clearing. he's halfway when bandit #20 steps out from the trees. they look at each other for a moment.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{just let me go. i don't want to be part of your army.}
<A>__{bandit #20 hesitates for a moment, then breaks into a grin.}
<D>__{bandit #20 my army. i like the sound of that.}
<A>__{the postman gestures with his knife.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{don't bandit #20 i got him! over }
<A>__{the postman lunges, digs into bandit #20's gut. he blinks in surprise, then sags to the ground. the postman takes a step back. a shadow falls over him. it's woody. staring down at the postman. they can hear others approaching from the river.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{they sent me to kill you.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{come with me.}
<A>__{at that moment, idaho and the second soldier come into the clearing. idaho grins, relaxes his grip on his gun when he sees the mismatch between woody and the postman.}
<C>__{idaho}
<D>__{good, boy. get him.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{it's you or me.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{idaho}
<D>__{finish it.}
<A>__{woody circles the postman, until he's facing idaho and the soldier. woody takes a long look at the postman, smiles.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{no harness on my back.}
<A>__{as the postman realizes what he's doing, woody flips his knife through the air and into the soldier's throat. as woody rushes him, idaho raises his gun. idaho pumps two rounds into woody, but the big man keeps coming. the third round finds his heart, puts woody down. dead. but not before he lands on top of idaho. as idaho struggles to get out from under woody's massive frame, the postman heads for the trees. covered in woody's blood, idaho fires a round as the postman disappears into the woods. idaho starts after him.}
<B>__{idaho}
<A>__{tracking. he sees a dribble of fresh blood. he touches it with his fingers and smiles. he cocks his head at movement to his left. smiling, hefting his pistol, idaho moves in. more shuffling. just ahead. he's got him now.}
<C>__{idaho}
<D>__{you want your st. rose?}
<A>__{there's a rustle of brush just before a roar splits the air. idaho doesn't even have time to scream as the lion pounces down on top of him.}
