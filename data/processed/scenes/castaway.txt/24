<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{those damn northern lights.}
<A>__{just then the lights go off. for a moment everything is darkness. then a small light switches on. chuck has a headlamp on. he gets up, heads into the bathroom. we stay in the bedroom. after only a moment, the light reemerges. it heads over to his bag. we go with it. chuck takes out a roll of toilet paper. the guy is prepared for anything. he goes into the bathroom, closes the door. the lights come back on just as the phone rings. we hear scuffling sounds on the other side of the door. chuck charges out, holding up his pants. grabs the phone.}
