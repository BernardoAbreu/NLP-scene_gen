<L>__{exterior big blue bus in motion morning.}
<A>__{through the unusual center window we see flor and cristina. flor, at this moment, is assimilating against every fiber in her body. cristina is excited, certain her life is taking an incandescent turn. quite a contrast.}
<L>__{exterior stone canyon and sunset morning}
<A>__{as the bus stops...bernice is across the street, along with some other kids and deborah, who is wearing her running clothes..flor and cristina exit the bus...}
<C>__{bernice}
<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{you just made it...i was getting worried..}
<A>__{deborah has a backpack loaded with books which she hands to cristina..}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{i picked up your books yesterday..}
<P>__{(by way of explanation to flor)}
<D>__{this is one of bernie's old..ancient backpacks.}
<A>__{cristina taking it...}
<C>__{cristina}
<D>__{oh, thank you..}
<A>__{as she shoulders it and almost falls over..}
<C>__{cristina }
<P>__{(impressed with the heft)}
<D>__{this is a great school.}
<C>__{deborah}
<P>__{(to cristina)}
<D>__{i got you a little first day at a new school present...}
<A>__{a school bus appears and heads toward them putting a certain deadline pressure on the transaction.}
<C>__{deborah }
<D>__{it's from me and....bernice.}
<P>__{(to flor)}
<D>__{okay? it is a big day.}
<A>__{flor's uncertain reaction is taken as a yes.}
<C>__{bernice}
<P>__{(dry)}
<D>__{what did we get her?}
<A>__{deborah hands cristina a locket..then, noting flor's expression.}
<C>__{deborah}
<P>__{(to cristina)}
<D>__{it's from all of us. your mother too.}
<C>__{flor}
<P>__{(to cristina)}
<D>__{it's not from me...}
<A>__{deborah does a good natured "take" accepting flor's reaction as if it where an eccentricity..as cristina and bernice board the bus, cristina generally says goodbye to both women, thereby depriving flor of her own moment of passage with her daughter.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{have a great year, girls..}
<P>__{(for flor)}
<D>__{this is so great. it fills your heart, doesn't it?}
<A>__{deborah turns and sees flor has already started doggedly up the hill..}
