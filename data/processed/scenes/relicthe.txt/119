<L>__{interior cuthbert's office night}
<A>__{cuthbert enters with jonathan and the dog, hobbes. cuthbert locks the door with shaking hands. he mutters to himself in terror.}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{solid oak. two inches thick. tell me they'll hold.}
<A>__{cuthbert scurries to his desk and pulls out a ruger .38 magnum.}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{i got it after i was mugged in the subway last spring.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{where's the walk in safe?}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{behind you.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{what's the combination?}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{i will do it. just let me find my portable phone.}
<A>__{he rummages in the darkness, going through his desk.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{forget it!}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{calm down. i found it!}
<A>__{cuthbert flips the phone open and turns it on.}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{battery's dead. shit.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{let's go!}
<A>__{cuthbert crosses to a huge wall safe, starts frantically turning the tumblers. jonathan follows with the dog.}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{that thing won't come after us, right? it's going for bigger game. the group blundering around in the basement. poor fools.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{hurry up!}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{just a minute. i'm shaking! take the gun.}
<A>__{cuthbert fumbles to hand over the ruger. as he does, something drops.}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{oh god! i dropped my rabbit's foot!}
<A>__{cuthbert drops to his knees, groping in the darkness.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{for chrissake, i will do it. what's the combination?!}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{to the left twice then five no... sorry... i think it's fifteen... it's been a while...}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{oh jesus...}
<A>__{jonathan starts again, sweating. the tumblers fall with agonizing slowness. cuthbert continues groping frantically for his good luck charm. meanwhile, unnoticed by jonathan, the dog is staring at the oak doors. we see the hair on his back rise!}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{fifteen... what's next?}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{eight to the right! look! i found it!}
<A>__{clutching the rabbit's foot like a talisman, cuthbert leaps up just as the last tumbler falls. at this the oak doors behind them crash open, splintering like so many match sticks. cuthbert screams in a high pitch whine at the sight of the beast. the dog barks wildly at mbwun! jonathan lifts his shot gun. but the monster barrels past him and zeros in on cuthbert! a huge red tongue licks out and encircles cuthbert's waist! it squeezes him horribly, drags him towards the open jaws! cuthbert bellows like a lamb being led to the slaughter. he opens his hand and the rabbit's foot drops! the last jonathan sees of cuthbert is his head disappearing down mbwun's throat. hobbes barks and whines in terror. jonathan takes the leash and drags the animal out.}
