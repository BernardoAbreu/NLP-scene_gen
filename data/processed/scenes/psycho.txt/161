<L>__{interior cabin one (day)}
<A>__{the blinds are closed and the room is almost night dark. sam comes in after lila, closes the door behind him. for a moment they just gaze at the room, as if willing it to tell them some satisfactory story. neither speaks. then, in dark silence, they begin to search, going methodically and thoroughly through all drawers, the closet, the desk, searching under the bed and in dark corners, not knowing what they expect to find and yet expecting to find some thing. lila opens the bathroom door, looks in. the windowless room is very dark. she switches on the light, goes in. sam moves toward the bathroom, is about to follow her in when he notices which room it is and automatically catches himself up, backs out.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{hospital clean.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{the bathroom. look at how clean it is. the one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!}
<A>__{sam goes in, glances around, nods. lila goes through the medicine cabinet, finds nothing but a glass and two tiny tabs of soap. sam leans against the door jamb, looks at the tub, the shower pipe above it. he continues to stare, more interested suddenly, as if bothered by some off key evidence he can't put his finger on. then he looks at the shower curtain rod. and realizes there is no shower curtain. he frowns, is about to say something when lila, who has been momentarily out of shot, interrupts. sam turns, camera turns, and we see lila is standing above the toilet bowl, a tiny piece of wet paper stuck to the tip of her right index finger.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{it didn't get washed down. it's figuring... the kind you tear up and get rid of.}
<P>__{(extending her finger toward sam)}
<D>__{some figure has been added to or subtracted from... forty thousand.}
<A>__{sam lifts the piece of paper off her finger, studies it, takes out his wallet, presses the wet scrap to his driver's license shield, puts it back in the wallet and puts the wallet away.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{that's proof mary was here! it would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(reminding)}
<D>__{bates never denied mary was here.}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(reminded)}
<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(a thought)}
<D>__{but maybe this proves that bates found out about the money.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{sam, that old woman, whoever she is. i think she told arbogast something! and i want her to tell us the same thing!}
<A>__{she starts out of the bathroom. sam takes hold of her arm, stops her.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you can't go up there.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{bates.}
<A>__{camera starts to pan away from them, moves slowly over the room, very slowly.}
<C>__{lila's voice }
<D>__{let's find him. one of us can keep him occupied while the other gets to the woman.}
<C>__{sam's voice }
<D>__{you won't be able to hold him still if he doesn't want to be held. and i don't like you going into that house alone, lila.}
<A>__{camera has panned clear across to the opposite wall now, and is moving up closer and closer to the tiny flowered wall paper, finally closing in on one small rosebud.}
<C>__{lila's voice }
<D>__{i can handle a sick old woman.}
<A>__{now we see that the rosebud has been cut out, that this is the reverse side of the hole norman peeped through to watch mary. and we see the pupil of norman's eye now.}
<C>__{sam's voice }
<D>__{all right. i will find bates and keep him occupied.}
<A>__{the eye moves away and there is a brief flash of light before the hole is covered, on the other side, by the wall hung painting. fresh angle lila and sam they are about to start out. sam stops her again.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{wait a minute. if you get anything out of the mother...}
<P>__{(a thought)}
<D>__{can you find your way back to town?}
<P>__{(as lila nods yes)}
<D>__{if you do get anything, don't stop to tell me.}
<A>__{lila nods quickly, hurries to the door. sam gets to it first, opens it a slight crack, looks out, then opens it wide enough for lila and himself to pass through.}
