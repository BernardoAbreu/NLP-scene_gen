<L>__{exterior mike's house backyard day}
<A>__{as mike rounds the corner, he almost runs into a smiling dom johnson, 36. don lugs 3 loaded trash bags.}
<C>__{dom}
<D>__{hey, mike. good to see you. tough break, you and scarlet.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{bite me, dom.}
<A>__{dom serves mike a cocky wink, continues on. mike scowls. scarlet, 36, slams a shovel into the ground, wedges it beneath a dying shrub and rips it out.}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{a little late for a delivery isn't it?}
<C>__{scarlet}
<D>__{dom was in the neighborhood. he offered to make a dump run for me.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{doesn't he live 30 miles from here?}
<C>__{scarlet}
<D>__{what's your point?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{come on. he's been after you since 10th grade and he's after you now.}
<C>__{scarlet}
<D>__{at least someone's after me.}
<A>__{mike smiles playfully and begins to serenade }
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{`in touch with the ground, i'm on the hunt i'm after you.' scarlet shakes her head }
<C>__{scarlet}
<D>__{please, mike. this isn't high school. that's not gonna work.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{`smell like i sound, i'm lost in a crowd, and i'm hungry like the wolf.'.}
<A>__{mike flirtatiously stalks her. scarlet fights smiling.}
<C>__{scarlet}
<D>__{you can stop now. it's not working.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{`mouth is alive, with juices like wine, and i'm hungry like the wolf'.}
<A>__{mike gets close to scarlet's face. she smiles, stops herself and pushes him away.}
<C>__{scarlet}
<D>__{you no longer have the right to invoke the "wolf."}
<A>__{a chastised mike eyes the yard... it's a wreck... holes and mounds of dirt everywhere, carcasses of dead plants, bushes and flowers strewn about.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{why are you destroying the yard?}
<A>__{scarlet stops shoveling, wipes dirt from her face.}
<C>__{scarlet}
<D>__{i'm gonna use it as a showpiece for clients. thanks for asking.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{kind of a big undertaking isn't it?}
<C>__{scarlet}
<D>__{i am a landscape designer. then again you barely took an interest in my work so i guess that's a fair question.}
<A>__{an awkward silence. then }
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i didn't get it.}
<C>__{scarlet}
<D>__{i'm sorry. but maybe this is what you needed. maybe it's time you looked for something else?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{that's a great idea, scar. because there are so many options out there for a 36 year old with only a high school diploma.}
<A>__{scarlet throws the shovel to the ground.}
<C>__{scarlet}
<D>__{and it's all my fault, isn't it?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i didn't say that.}
<C>__{scarlet}
<D>__{no, but it's what you think, right?}
<A>__{mike's silence says it all. scarlet fights back tears.}
<C>__{scarlet }
<D>__{i never asked you to marry me.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{but i did.}
<A>__{scarlet shakes her head in frustration.}
<C>__{scarlet}
<D>__{i'm sorry you're not happy with the way your life turned out mike, really, i am, but you're not the victim here.}
<A>__{scarlet goes back to shoveling. mike turns, steps, falls into a hole.}
