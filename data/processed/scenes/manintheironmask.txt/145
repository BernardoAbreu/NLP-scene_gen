<L>__{exterior lane of elms beside the palace day}
<A>__{at the end of a lane of elms, where the markers of king's graves stand clustered, royal workmen place a mighty marble monument stone above the final resting place of d'artagnan. athos, aramis, porthos, and the king phillippe, known as king louis now stand gathered there, as aramis in his priest's garments utters the funeral incantations. aramis' voice breaks as he does so. porthos' eyes pour out rivers of tears. athos' grief is beyond weeping. phillippe holds the arm of his mother. she holds the rose d'artagnan left her.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{amen.}
<A>__{athos moves up between aramis and porthos, and links them with his arms.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{he was the best of us all.}
<A>__{aramis and porthos move off together, to walk the lane of elms; athos remains by the grave, unable to leave. phillippe pats anne's arm.}
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{i will be with you in a moment, mother.}
<A>__{she too moves down the lane of trees, touching the tip of the rose pedals to her lips as the tears run down her face. phillippe moves up to athos.}
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{after all you have done, i must ask you one more service to your king. i have lost my father. and you have lost your son. let me love you like a son to a father. and i pray you live for this, to love me like your son.}
<A>__{athos can't speak; he can only nod yes. phillippe moves to join his mother, leaving athos to take one final look down at the grave. then as athos moves off to join aramis and porthos, we pan from the name "d'artagnan" on the stone, to the pattern chiseled beneath the name. it is a mask, of iron.}
