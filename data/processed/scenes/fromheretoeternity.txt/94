<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior clearing in valley night}
<B>__{full shot}
<A>__{shooting through smoke rising from one of the trench ovens. as it clears we see the enormous hawaiian woman and one or two others cleaning up and putting out the remnants of the fires. the merrymakers and dancers have gone; the luau is over. in b.g., quite alone, are warden and karen, sitting on the trunk of a fallen palm tree.}
<B>__{medium shot karen and warden}
<A>__{the abandoned gaiety of the earlier scene gone. they survey the emptiness. the fat hawaiian woman comes near, rakes ashes over one of the dying fires. she speaks to warden in hawaiian. he answers her in the native tongue. the fat woman stares, shrugs, goes off.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what did she say?}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{she said it's over time to go home }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{home... a beach, a car, a park...}
<A>__{warden puts his arm around her tenderly.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{it'll work out...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{it can't go on like this much longer, milt.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{he rises, paces a moment.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{if there were only a way! your lovin husband'd probly give you the divorce. but even if he didn't know what for, he'd never let me transfer.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(bucking up courage; quietly)}
<D>__{there is a way. i've been thinking about it.}
<A>__{warden looks at her apprehensively.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you've got to become an officer.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{what!}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you're eligible for the extension course that came in with the draft. when you get your commission they'd ship you back to the states new officers aren't kept at posts where they've been enlisted men. then }
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{you sure made a thorough study of it.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{then i could divorce dana and follow you and marry you.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{an officer! i've always hated officers.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{that's a fine, intelligent point of view. suppose i said i've always hated sergeants. that would make a lot of sense, wouldn't it?}
<B>__{close shot warden}
<A>__{he sits, thinks it over unhappily.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{okay, suppose i did it. and don't think it's a cinch the exams are tough. then you'd be getting your divorce here while i'm in the states. we'd be apart maybe six months! we'll probly be in the war by then }
<C>__{two shot}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you can't be certain of that }
<C>__{warden}
<P>__{(snorts)}
<D>__{put it down on your calendar. on october twenty third, 1941, milt warden told you we'd be in the war in less than a year.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(flaring)}
<D>__{why don't you tell the truth?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you just don't want the responsibility. you're probably not even in love with me }
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{you're crazy! i wish i wasn't in love with you. maybe could enjoy life again.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i don't know what's happened to you you were honest at first }
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{at first! you were tough and solid as a rock and now you're a whining crybaby }
<A>__{he stops abruptly.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{and so they were married and lived unhappily ever after.}
<A>__{they are silent for several moments.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{i've never been so miserable in my life as i have since i met you.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{neither have i.}
<C>__{warden}
<P>__{(cheerlessly)}
<D>__{i wouldn't trade a minute of it.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(cheerlessly)}
<D>__{neither would i.}
<A>__{warden rises and paces again. suddenly he stops, turns, looks down at karen, speaks in the same gloomy tone.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{i will probably make the lousiest officer they ever saw in this army.}
<A>__{a happy smile creeps over karen's face. despite himself, he begins to smile also.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(fervently)}
<D>__{you'll make a fine officer. a remarkable officer.}
