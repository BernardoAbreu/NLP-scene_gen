<A>__{we move from the faces of the freelings and lesh to: their pov of video monitors night we see the empty hallway and staircase in black and white on one screen. one the other a spectroscopic breakdown of color patterns in infrared. the picture on the screen becomes grainy, smoky. a bright glowly substance begins to form into tendrils that move down the stairs and very close to the cameras. the black and white monitor shows what the human eye captured. the color infrared shows what the technology captured. close on diane night move in to her as she watches the color monitor. close on monitor night the smoky substance twists and melts and forms what appears to be the shape of a man’s back. the shape moves in front of the camera and we see what could be an old man looking over his shoulder with a suspicious expression, and then walking past a little girl, not carol anne, holding a ball. she wanders through the living room as if lost. suddenly, the living room is filled with manifestations. four men in burlap type coats, floppy hats, denim and boots face away from the cameras, a woman dressed in the style of the 1920’s moves through the room, tears on her face people of all ages and descriptions wander aimlessly, lost and sad through the living room. no manifestation makes contact with any other. they don’t even seem to be aware that others exist an old woman glances at the cameras disinterestedly and a young boy moves toward the camera and evaporates. the screen suddenly becomes black, filled by two glowing beams the beam pull back and we realize they are eyes of a scary old man. it is the face of pure chaotic horror. a vision of madness and murder. on diane and robbie night she covers robbie’s eyes and screams continuously, out of control, for this is the pit of her nightmare.}

<A>__{angle full steve is holding diane now, stroking her hair until her screams turn into sobs. lesh and the technicians look on silently. steve leads diane and robbie back into the living room. dr. lesh takes out the two tapes and puts them into a briefcase and locks it with a key.}
