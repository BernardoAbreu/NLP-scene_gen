<D>__{...a very gifted photographer.}
<A>__{through charlie's lens: a cheerleader's ripe buttocks, peeking out from beneath a short pleated skirt. as she kicks and jumps, her little red panties wedge themselves firmly between her cheeks. the camera skillfully tracks her movements, waiting until... the cheerleader's hand comes down. in slow mo, her finger slips under her panties and tugs on the fabric, pulling it over her cheeks. charlie's motor drive whirls. rapid still shots of the cheerleader's bottom}

<D>__{the senior class voted him, "most likely to have a restraining order filed against him." but that's another story.}

<P>__{(winking at ted)}
<D>__{don't knock it till you tried it.}

<D>__{someday, i will find out.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you have a better chance of being hit by a mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.}
