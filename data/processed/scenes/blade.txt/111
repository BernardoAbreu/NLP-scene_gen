<L>__{interior the temple of night}
<A>__{a vast, barrel vaulted chamber lined with recessed tombs stretches out before us an underground cathedral of sorts, wrought from alabaster and marble. restrained. elegant. replete with dark splendor.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{as above, so below.}
<A>__{torches burn in wall sconces, casting everything in a warm, amber glow. frost takes in the beauty of the place.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{welcome to our hall of ancients, doctor. we call it the temple of night.}
<A>__{blade and karen are led to the middle of the room, where a stone altar rises up from a dais. blade is roughly thrown to the ground. he kneels there, eyes cast downward. broken. his system being assaulted by the devastating effects of the thirst. quinn and mercury pick their way through blade's discarded gear. quinn picks up the punching dagger, admiring it. frost turns to mercury, who's been holding blade's scabbarded sword.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{let's see this sword of his.}
<A>__{mercury draws the sword, handing it to frost. he sights down the length of it, testing its weight. with a flick of his wrist, he lashes out, slashing blade's cheek open.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{still quite sharp, i see.}
<A>__{blade feebly struggles to rise. frost clubs him on the back of the neck with the sword pommel. blade crumples. karen tries to pull free, but quinn holds her tight.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{blade }
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{you're wasting your breath, woman. he can't hear you now. it's the thirst, you see? it already has him in its grip.}
<A>__{frost reaches down, dragging blade's head up by his hair. karen watches on as frost continues to taunt him.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{how long has it been since you had your serum? twelve hours? more? you must be quite thirsty by now.}
<A>__{he crouches down so he's eye to eye with blade.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{what does it feel like? is your blood on fire? are you burning up inside? give in to the thirst, blade. embrace your true nature.}
<A>__{blade shivers, grits his teeth, it's like he's going through heroin withdrawal.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{ go to hell }
<A>__{frost smiles, his eyes burning with an infernal glow.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{i've got news for you, blade. we're already here.}
<A>__{frost turns to the others, motioning.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{take him to the sanctuary. it's time he was bled.}
<A>__{the other vampires retreat, dragging blade along with them. karen is left alone with frost and quinn.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{i'd let you watch the proceedings, doctor, but i'm afraid that privilege is reserved for members of my own race. don't worry, though, i've made alternate arrangements for you.}
<A>__{frost motions and quinn drags karen towards }
<B>__{the mouth of a pit}
<A>__{some forty feet deep, its lichen encrusted stone walls worn smooth over time. as frost gestures to the yawning darkness beneath them, quinn forces karen towards the edge.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{we call this the bone pit. it's where we keep our mistakes, the ones who couldn't successfully make the transition from human to vampire.}
<A>__{frost reaches out, caressing karen's neck, puncturing the soft flesh beneath her chin with a razored fingernail.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{they'll feed on anything, given the chance animals, corpses, even other vampires.}
<A>__{frost nods. karen struggles against quinn, but it's no good. in a manner of seconds, she's falling }
