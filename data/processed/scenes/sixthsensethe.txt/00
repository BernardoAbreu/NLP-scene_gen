<A>__{a naked lightbulb sparks to life. it dangles from the ceiling of a basement. light, quick footsteps as anna crowe moves down the stairs. anna is the rare combination of beauty and innocence. she stands in the chilly basement in an elegant summer dress that outlines her slender body. her gentle eyes move across the empty room and come to rest on a rack of wine bottles covering one entire wall. she walks to the bottles. her fingertips slide over the labels. she stops when she finds just the right one. a tiny smile as she slides it out. anna turns to leave. stops. she stares at the shadowy basement. it's an unsettling place. she stands very still and watches her breath form a tiny cloud in the cold air. she's visibly uncomfortable. anna crowe moves for the staircase in a hurry. each step faster than the nexterior she climbs out of the basement in another burst of light, quick footsteps.}
<B>__{we hear her hit the light switch. the lightbulb dies. dripping black devours the room.}
