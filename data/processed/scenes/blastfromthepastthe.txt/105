<A>__{the bus stops mid block and adam gets off. he crosses the street causing only one car to hit the brakes. on the other side of the avenue we see what has gotten his attention. it's an adult bookstore much like the last one we saw (probably owned by the same chain.) he's happy but when he looks next door he sees he's in a different place. sad and lost he turns north and starts to walk until a billboard catches his attention. we pan up to see a billboard for liposuction that features an almost nude woman. adam is struck by the image and we spend some time cutting between him and it. then gathering himself he turns and begins to walk south.}
