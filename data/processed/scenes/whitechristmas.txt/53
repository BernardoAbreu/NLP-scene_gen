<D>__{how about it, waverly, want to play?}
<C>__{waverly}
<P>__{(looking at him a moment)}
<D>__{i'm too young for that sort of thing.}
<A>__{first owner laughs goodnaturedly and continues playing. bob rides into the scene and dismounts. med. shot bob and waverly bob sits into the shot.}
<C>__{waverly}
<D>__{kind of warm for that kind of exercise, isn't it?}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(trying to help)}
<D>__{it isn't very warm.}
<P>__{(he looks to the sky)}
<D>__{i think the weatherman's wrong about his forecast. those look like snow clouds to me.}
<C>__{waverly}
<P>__{(without looking up)}
<D>__{they're cumulus clouds, at an elevation of seven thousand feet.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<P>__{(still trying)}
<D>__{still, weather's a funny thing. it could snow overnight.}
<C>__{waverly}
<P>__{(he thinks a moment)}
<D>__{i will tell you something i haven't told my family. i'm going back in the army.}

<C>__{bob}
<D>__{where are you going to be sent, sir?}
<C>__{waverly}
<D>__{well, i'm not sure yet. i've always been a combat officer, but i got an idea they're going to try and palm off one of the training commands on me. they'd better not. they just better not.}
<P>__{(he's worked up now)}
<D>__{i'm not ready for pitching horseshoes yet.}
<P>__{(he smiles)}
<D>__{now nothing to the women folk about this!}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<C>__{waverly}
<D>__{let's mosey over to the post office, i'm expecting a letter any day.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(remembering)}
<D>__{oh, i beg your pardon, sir.}
<P>__{(he pulls the letter out of his pocket)}
<D>__{that's what i came over to give you, it slipped my mind.}
<A>__{the general takes the letter, he looks at it front and back.}
<C>__{waverly}
<P>__{(solemn)}
<D>__{this is the one.}
<P>__{(he opens it, he}
<D>__{squints. he looks}
<P>__{to bob)}
<D>__{my glasses are in my room. i'd like to read it by myself, but i'm a little anxious.}
<P>__{(he smiles at his own predicament)}
<D>__{read it, son. slowly.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{dear tom: why, you dirty, old }
<P>__{(he stops)}
<C>__{waverly}
<P>__{(pleased)}
<D>__{skip that word.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{it certainly was a surprise hearing from you. your amusing letter was appreciated more than you imagine. of course you've got plenty of time to be amusing, sitting on that porch, rocking away, while we put in a full day's work. you always were a lucky stiff, and i envy you. a few years more, i was saying to emmy the other evening, and i'm going to be able to take it easy like old tom.}
<C>__{waverly}
<P>__{(just repeats)}
<D>__{old tom.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{oh, well, some people have all the luck. everyone in the family is fine here. carol had the mumps, which is no joke at eleven years of age }
<C>__{waverly}
<D>__{the rest of the letter is about the family.}
<P>__{(bob looks at him,}
<D>__{and then glances at the rest to see if}
<P>__{it is so)}
<D>__{he's telling me they have nothing for me, we're not fooling each other.}
<P>__{(he holds has hand out)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<P>__{(bob gives him his}

<P>__{at being light)}
<D>__{say, it couldn't be hard to learn to pitch horseshoes. now could it?}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(trapped, unhappy for him)}
<D>__{no sir.}
<P>__{(his nerve up)}
<D>__{begging your pardon, sir, there's a lot to be said for leisure. you're not used to it, you've always been active, but in time }
<A>__{he stops, seeing waverly's expression. waverly winks at him.}
<C>__{waverly}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{never kid a kidder. go on back to the hotel.}
<C>__{bob}
