<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{inside the faro room}
<A>__{in the center is a beautifully carved wooden table, on which sit a faro board and a dealing box, tended by a stone faced dealer, who calls the progress of the game in a continuous abacus like device that keeps track of the cards which have already been played. on the opposite side of the table, completely absorbed in the rhythmic appearance of the cards from the dealing box, sits doyle lonnegan. although is clothes and accessories are those of a wealthy man, there is a coarseness to both his movement and speech which bespeak lower class origins, for which he now has nothing but contempt. floyd enters the room and approaches him cautiously, trying hard to make as little noise as possible.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{doyle, can i see you a minute?}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<P>__{(not looking up from the table)}
<D>__{i'm busy, floyd.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{it's important. we had a little trouble in chicago today. one of our runners got hit for 12 grand.}

<D>__{which one?}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{mottola.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{you sure he didn't just pocket it?}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{no, we checked his story with a tipster. he was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{they workin' for anybody?}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{i don't know. could be. we're runnin' that down now.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{all right, mark mottola up a little and put him on a bus. nothin' fancy, just enough to keep him from coming back. get some local people to take care of the other two.}
<P>__{(impassively)}
<D>__{we gotta discourage this kinda thing.}
