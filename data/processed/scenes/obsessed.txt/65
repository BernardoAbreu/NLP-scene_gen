<A>__{derek walks to his yukon suv, the only car remaining. he beeps it and the doors unlock. as derek opens the driver's door and slides inside, the passenger door opens and lisa slips in, wearing her overcoat and an intimate smile.}

<P>__{(startled)}
<D>__{what are you }

<C>__{derek}
<D>__{lisa... nothing happened.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{all right, have it your way. nothing happened.}
<A>__{lisa lets the front of her overcoat fall open. she's naked underneath.}
<C>__{derek}
<P>__{(jolt of panic)}

<D>__{why?}
<C>__{derek}

<A>__{derek suddenly reaches across her and throws open the passenger door.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{i don't know if you're just dense or what's wrong with you but i want you to understand something. there's nothing going on between us. i would never never jeopardize my job with a co worker.}
<C>__{isa}
<D>__{maybe you are an asshole. wow.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{get out!}
<A>__{derek physically forces her out. derek quickly turns the key in the ignition, revs the engine and peels out in reverse. the passenger door bangs shut. lisa stands there in her overcoat staring in mute disappointment as derek speeds out of the parking garage.}
