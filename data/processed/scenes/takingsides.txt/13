<L>__{interior steve's office day}
<A>__{another man, schlee, is in the chair. only steve and emmi now. pale, yellow electric light. silence. schlee, too, is very nervous. at last:}
<C>__{schlee}
<D>__{no, no, no, i give you my word. i was never a member of the nazi party. never. i am in the percussion section. i play the timpani.}
<A>__{steve just stares at him.}
<C>__{schlee}
<D>__{anyway, they would never have allowed it. my brother was married to a jewess, may she rest in peace. and goebbels said...}
<P>__{(to emmi)}
<D>__{...please take this down carefully, because it's most important, fraulein?}
<C>__{emmi}
<D>__{straube.}
<C>__{schlee}
<P>__{(acting surprised)}
<D>__{straube? are you by any chance related to colonel joachim straube?}
<C>__{emmi}
<D>__{my father.}
<C>__{schlee}
<D>__{he was... he was a great hero.}
<A>__{steve lights a cigarette.}
<C>__{schlee}
<D>__{goebbels, yes, josef goebbels said, 'there's not a single filthy jew left in germany on whose behalf dr. furtwangler has not intervened.' no, no one could have been less of a nazi than dr. furtwangler.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{but this was the same guy who conducted for adolf on his birthday.}
<C>__{schlee}
<D>__{he was forced to do that. but he refused to give the nazi salute in front of hitler. he kept his baton in his hand, you can't salute with a baton in your hand.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{and what about the nuremberg rally?}
<C>__{schlee}
<D>__{no, we...we played on the evening before the rally.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(straight faced)}
<D>__{oh! the evening before, i see...}
<C>__{schlee}
<D>__{yes, dr. furtwangler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{politics and art must be kept separate. i will remember that. but let me see if you can help me with something i just don't understand. i'd really like to know why all you guys are so crazy about him. what's his secret?}
<A>__{schlee tries to find words.}
<C>__{schlee}
<D>__{well, it's hard to explain. i can only tell you from my own experience. soon after i joined the orchestra, we were rehearsing the third symphony of beethoven, the eroica. there are several rather difficult passages for the timpani. one particular crescendo. during the break, i asked how he wanted it played. he was studying his score. he didn't look up. he said, 'just watch me.' so, of course, i did. i never stopped watching him. the moment came. and suddenly, he turned to me and our eyes were locked. there was something in his look that... that simply demanded the crescendo. i shall never forget his look. it was a moment of... of magic.}
<A>__{steve nods, thinks for a moment. then:}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you ever seen adolf hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? i've seen 'em on films.}
<C>__{schlee}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{was looking at furtwangler like that?}
<C>__{schlee}
<D>__{i don't know what you mean, major.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{when you got to the crescendo.}
<A>__{schlee looks at him bewildered.}
