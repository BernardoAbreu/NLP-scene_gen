<L>__{interior vincent's room}
<A>__{he's barely alive but alive nonetheless. and he's heard sam speak in french to the doctor.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{you son of a bitch...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{you speak french.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what of it?}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(in mock exasperation)}
<D>__{nothing...}
<A>__{he lies back on his pillow, pissed and yet amused.}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(repeating the doctor's words in english)}
<D>__{"your field dressing saved his life." that's three i owe you.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you don't owe me a goddamned thing, vincent, and you know it. you stepped in front of a bullet for me.}
<P>__{(very seriously, he now believes this)}
<D>__{i owe you a heavy debt.}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(relishing this)}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(rising to leave)}
<D>__{you better get some sleep, alright?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{tell me something first.}
<P>__{(a quick beat)}
<D>__{the package: what was it?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i don't know. nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us. there's probably a couple of guys back at the company who know, but i don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{what happened to it?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{gone. destroyed.}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(sighs, then a beat)}
<D>__{i guess that's for the best.}
<A>__{sam turns for the door but vincent has one last thing to say.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{sam, when gregor had deirdre by the lake, you could have killed the two of them with one shot. you could have had the package, finished the job. but you didn't, you sacrificed the job to save her life. why?}
<A>__{same has to think about this for a second, and his answer reveals just how full circle he's come.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it's what you would have done.}
<A>__{and on that note sam exits the room, leaving a bemused vincent behind.}
