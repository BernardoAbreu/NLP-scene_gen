<A>__{the tea kettle whistles! laura pulls it off the burner. the whistling subsides... replaced by the distant sound of water running upstairs. ned cocks his head, listening.}

<D>__{okay. i will make the ovaltine.}
<A>__{ned exits. laura opens the ovaltine container. it's empty. a dark shadow moves past the window behind laura. suspense music. laura opens the cupboard. pigeons explode out, wings beating furiously! she catches her breath, looks in the cupboard. the cans and boxes are covered with pigeon shit. she shoves them aside, looking for the ovaltine.}
