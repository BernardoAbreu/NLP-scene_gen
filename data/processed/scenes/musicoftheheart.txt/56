<A>__{robert washes dishes and assunta dries. the leftovers from an italian dinner are on the counter.}
<C>__{assunta}
<D>__{i still don't understand the rush.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{having my own place will make me feel like i'm really starting my life again.}
<C>__{assunta}
<D>__{but if you invested your divorce settlement, you could buy something nice someday. it's bad enough that you've been renting in this neighborhood, but to lock yourself into a mortgage }
<C>__{roberta}
<P>__{(snapping)}
<D>__{mama, please. just stop!}
<A>__{assunta backs off. roberta feels guilty and moves to her.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{don't worry, o.k.? besides, if things keep going well, i'm sure eventually brian will move in with us.}
<A>__{a few beats.}
<C>__{assunta}
<D>__{how much do you know about this man?}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{brian's a good person, he's helped me a lot, he's great with the boys since he got back to town, it's been really sweet.}
<C>__{assunta}
<P>__{(with an attitude)}
<D>__{and how long has he been back?}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{two months.}
<C>__{assunta}
<D>__{that's not very long. don't make the same mistake twice, bert. you barely knew charles when you married him.}
<C>__{roberta}
<P>__{(defensive)}
<D>__{i don't get it you're ragging on me about buying the house i would think you'd want brian to live with me.}
<C>__{assunta}
<D>__{not if he's the wrong person.}
<A>__{roberta locks her jaw, not wanting to believe that she's right.}
