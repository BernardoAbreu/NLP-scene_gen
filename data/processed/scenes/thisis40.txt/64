<L>__{interior laguna hotel room night}
<A>__{pete and debbie are in bed in their underwear.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{why do we fight?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i don't know, it makes no sense at all.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{it makes no sense.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{when we get in a fight, look in my eyes. let's remember this moment right now and know that we never have to fight.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{but you're such a dick sometimes.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i know, i am a dick sometimes. people think i'm so nice, but i'm such a dick.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{thank you for admitting that.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{and you get so mad at me. i feel like you want to kill me.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{i do want to kill you.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{how would you do it?}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{i don't know... poison you. i'd poison your cupcakes that you pretend not to eat everyday. and just put enough in to slowly weaken you.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i love it.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{i would enjoy our last few months together.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{me too.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{because you'd be so weak and sweet, and i could take care of you but while killing you.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{see? you know what i love about us? you can still surprise me. i figured for sure you'd knock me out with one fell swoop. but you would extend it over a series of months.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{have you ever thought about killing me?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{oh, yeah.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{how would you do it?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{wood chipper.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{a wood chipper?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{did you see fargo?}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{pete makes a wood chipping splatter noise.}
<C>__{debbie }
<D>__{wow. that's a bad plan. the cupcakes is a way better plan.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{it is. you know what? i won't murder you.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{aw. i love you.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i love you too... hey. you know what i brought?}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{a medical marijuana cookie. ben gave it to me last christmas.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{chocolate chip koo kie.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{should we do it?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{let's eat the cookie, and then we'll order a bunch of cheeseburgers. let's order the entire room service menu.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{just get all of it. you deserve it. you really do.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{wouldn't you rather have me around for less years and i'm incredibly happy than longer and miserable?}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{yes, and i just realized that right now. go get the cookie!}
<A>__{pete runs into the bathroom. he looks for the cookie.}
<C>__{debbie }
<D>__{should we watch porn when we eat the cookie?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{should we get a block of porn?}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{i don't think we need twenty four hours of porn.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{yeah, but you know, two porns cost about as much as a block.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{i think that's too much porn.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{we don't have to watch it all, but for the value it makes sense.}
