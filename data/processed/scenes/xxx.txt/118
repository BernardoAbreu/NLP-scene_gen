<A>__{slovo is sitting in the armchair.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{dude, what are you doing here?}
<C>__{slovo}
<D>__{you killed me, remember? now i have to hide out here with you. where have you been?}
<A>__{xander holsters his gun, searches around for his communicator.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{i found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. they've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.}
<C>__{slovo}
<D>__{is this what you're looking for?}
<A>__{xander turns to see slovo waving the communicator.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{yeah, give it here.}
<A>__{slovo raises his pistol.}
<C>__{slovo}
<D>__{sorry, "dude".}
<C>__{xander}
<P>__{(stunned beat)}
<D>__{what's the deal?}
<C>__{slovo}
<D>__{oh come on, don't feel bad. you got played, so what? you're new at this. did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{why you dogging me up?}
<C>__{slovo}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{they came and found me. they said they'd kill me unless i help them. plus they offer me a lot of money. no big deal. these things happen. dump your gun on the floor.}
<A>__{xander does so.}
<C>__{slovo}
<D>__{where do you want it? the head to be quick? or the chest for an open casket?}
<A>__{suddenly gunfire blasts through the closed door. bullets shatter a lamp, a picture, and finally tag slovo in a wild salvo. slovo crumples, never knowing what hit him. the door creaks open. it's petra, her gun still smoking. she's with the ivans.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{are you alright?}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing? you could've killed me!}
<C>__{petra}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{i heard you talking. i could tell where you were in the room.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{i don't know what's going on anymore. i thought i was square with that dude. now everybody's switching sides like it's the wwf.}
<A>__{the ivans go to slovo's body, kicking the gun from his hands. one of them spits on his corpse in disgust.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{what are you doing with the ivans?}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{i know which cops are good and which are bad. come with me. come on, right now.}
<A>__{she drags him to the door.}
