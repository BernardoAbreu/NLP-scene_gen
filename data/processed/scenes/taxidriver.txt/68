<D>__{i know this may not mean anything to you, baby, but sometimes i get so emotional, sometimes i think, i wish every man could have what i have now, that every woman could be loved the way i love you. i go home and i think what it would be without you, and then i thank god for you. i think to myself, man, you are so lucky. you got a woman who loves you, who needs you, a woman who keeps you strong. it's just you and me. i'm nothing without you. i can go like this for ever and ever. we can do it, baby. you and me. just you and me.}
