<L>__{interior rachel's bedroom night}
<A>__{the room is surprisingly bare and simple, almost empty apart from rachel's collection of old and faded dolls on the shelves and on the bed. rachel is getting dressed for the evening. a hairdresser stands behind her, fussing with her hair. rachel hears the music coming from outside and moves to the window. (the hairdresser moves with her, still busy with the brush.) gazing across the garden, she sees the light in frank's room and hears her own voice singing out from there too.}
