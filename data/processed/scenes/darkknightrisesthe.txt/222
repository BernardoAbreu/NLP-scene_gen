<A>__{wayne moves to the wall takes the rope from the tattooed prisoner, wraps it around his chest. curious prisoners gather, the prisoner at their head. wayne looks up at the light, hundreds of feet above. starts to climb. prisoners get excited as wayne rises money starts exchanging hands. reaching the precipice, he checks his rope, looks up at the next handhold, far away. he takes a breath, then leaps. his fingers brush the ledge. wayne drops a hundred feet the rope catches, slamming him into the rock face. the prisoners disperse, losing interest as the tattooed prisoner lowers wayne on the rope. the blind prisoner turns away.}
