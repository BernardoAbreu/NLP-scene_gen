<L>__{exterior french roadside dawn}
<A>__{beautiful morning. the red car parked along the road. bourne alone in the passenger seat. deep asleep. nestled there. and then, he wakes suddenly. starts. freaked for a moment. instantly feeling for the red bag. there it is in his lap. he looks around and marie sitting away from the car. she's got a loaf of bread. a soda. smoking a butt. same clothes, but her make up's been washed away. clean. simple. gorgeous. bourne steps out. morning legs.}
