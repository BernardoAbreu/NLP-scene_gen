<L>__{interior rob's apartment night}
<A>__{rob opens the door to find laura filling a duffel bag in the living room.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i called and called but you were out. i thought i'd be gone before you got back.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{is that the last of it?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{yep. i might have missed some stuff. i'm so used to some things being here that i don't even notice them.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{those look heavy. where's ian?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{he's at home. listen, i can't believe he went to the store. i'm mortified, actually. i'm really sorry. he had no right to do that, and i told him so.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{it was kind of funny.}
<A>__{they smile.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i'm sure.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{you still together? going all right?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{that bad, eh?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{you know what i mean.}
<A>__{rob flops onto the couch and surveys the room.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{it's a dump, isn't it?}
<A>__{laura sits down, on the other side of the couch.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{fix it up. it'll make you feel better.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i will bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you? i mean, how much are you making now? sixty? seventy? and you were living in this shitty place.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{you know i didn't mind. and it's not as if ray's place is any better.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i'm sorry, but can we get this straight? what is his fucking name, ian or ray? what do you call him?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{ray. i hate ian.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i hate him too. so i just call him "mavis." or "sissyboy." or "mavis the sissyboy."}
<A>__{laura starts laughing, laying on the couch on her back, very close to rob. rob leans in, sort of looking down into her eyes.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{this is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{you make me laugh much more than ray does, if that's what you're getting at. but i already knew you could make me laugh. it's everything else i don't know about.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{you know i'm a good person.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{mmm hmm.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{you know that i can cook my ass off when i feel like it.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{oh ho, so very infrequently.}
<A>__{he moves a little closer.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{you know my favorite beverage is your bath water.}
<A>__{she laughs. he moves in, not really trying to kiss her but leaving the door open for her... she almost goes for it, but instead gets to her feet.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{time to go.}
<A>__{she goes to her bags. rob points to a pile of cds.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{don't forget your cds.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{those aren't mine.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{sure they are.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{they're not really, though, are they? i know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you. i can't take them, i know they'd just sit around staring at me, and i'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand? that sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me. i like sting and you hate him. but the rest of this stuff...}
<P>__{(bending down to the pile)}
<D>__{who the hell is nick lowe? or gram parsons? or the boredoms? i don't know these people. i...}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{okay, okay. i get the picture.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i'm sorry to go on about it. but, i don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and i want to make sure you get it.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i got it. you like sting but you don't like gram parsons, because you've never heard of him.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{you're being deliberately obtuse.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i guess i am.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{well, think about it.}
<A>__{she hefts the duffel bag, opens the door and exits.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{fuck.}
