<L>__{interior mozart's apartment bedroom night 1790's}
<A>__{mozart is sitting up in bed, propped against pillows. the coins lie on the coverlet; many candles burn in the necks of bottles. salieri, without coat or wig, is seated at an improvised worktable. on it are blank sheets of music paper, quills, and ink. also the score of the requiem mass as so far composed. mozart is bright eyed with a kind of fever. salieri is also possessed with an obviously feverish desire to put down the notes as quickly as mozart can dictate them.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{where did i stop?}
<C>__{salieri}
<P>__{(consulting the manuscript)}
<D>__{the end of the recordare statuens in parte dextra.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{so now the confutatis. confutatis maledictis. when the wicked are confounded. flammis acribus addictis. how would you translate that?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{consigned to flames of woe.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{do you believe in it?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{a fire which never dies. burning one forever?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{oh, yes.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{strange!}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{come. let's begin.}
<A>__{he takes his pen.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{confutatis maledictis.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{we ended in f major?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{so now a minor. suddenly.}
<A>__{salieri writes the key signature.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{the fire.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{what time?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{common time.}
<A>__{salieri writes this, and continues now to write as swiftly and urgently as he can, at mozart's dictation. he is obviously highly expert at doing this and hardly hesitates. his speed, however, can never be too fast for mozart's impatient mind.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{start with the voices. basses first. second beat of the first measure a.}
<P>__{(singing the note)}
<D>__{con fu ta tis.}
<P>__{(speaking)}
<D>__{second measure, second beat.}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{ma le dic tis.}
<P>__{(speaking)}
<D>__{g sharp, of course.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{third measure, second beat starting on e.}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{flam mis a cri bus ad dic tis.}
<P>__{(speaking)}
<D>__{and fourth measure, fourth beat d.}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{ma le dic tis, flam mis a cri bus ad dic tis.}
<P>__{(speaking)}
<D>__{do you have that?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{i think so.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{sing it back.}
<A>__{salieri sings back the first six measures of the bass line. after the first two measures a chorus of basses fades in on the soundtrack and engulfs his voice. they stop.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{good. now the tenors. fourth beat of the first measure c.}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{con fu ta tis.}
<P>__{(speaking)}
<D>__{second measure, fourth beat on d.}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{ma le dic tis.}
<P>__{(speaking)}
<D>__{all right?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{fourth measure, second beat f.}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{flam mis a cri bus ad dic tis, flam mis a cri bus ad dic tis.}
<A>__{his voice is lost on the last words, as tenors engulf it and take over the soundtrack, singing their whole line from the beginning, right to the end of the sixth measure where the basses stopped, but he goes on mouthing the sounds with them. salieri writes feverishly. we see his pen jotting down the notes as quickly as possible: the ink flicks onto the page. the music stops again.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{now the orchestra. second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. identical notes and rhythm.}
<P>__{(he hurriedly hums}
<D>__{the opening notes of}
<P>__{the bass vocal line)}
<D>__{the first bassoon and tenor trombone }
<C>__{salieri}
<P>__{(labouring to keep up)}
<D>__{please! just one moment.}
<A>__{mozart glares at him, irritated. his hands move impatiently. salieri scribbles frantically.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{it couldn't be simpler.}
<C>__{salieri}
<P>__{(finishing)}
<D>__{first bassoon and tenor trombone what?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{with the tenors.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{also identical?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{exactly. the instruments to go with the voices. trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant.}
<A>__{he again hums the bass vocal line from the beginning, conducting. on the soundtrack, we hear the second bassoon and bass trombone play it with him and the first bassoon and tenor trombone come in on top, playing the tenor vocal line. we also hear the trumpets and timpani. the sound is bare and grim. it stops at the end of the sixth measure. salieri stops writing.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{and that's all?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{oh no. now for the fire.}
<P>__{(he smiles)}
<D>__{strings in unison ostinato on all like this.}
<A>__{he sings the urgent first measure of the ostinato.}
<C>__{mozart}
<P>__{(speaking)}
<D>__{second measure on b.}
<A>__{he sings the second measure of the ostinato.}
<C>__{mozart}
<P>__{(speaking)}
<D>__{do you have me?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{i think so.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{show me.}
<A>__{salieri sings the first two measures of the string ostinato.}
<C>__{mozart}
<P>__{(excitedly)}
<D>__{good, good yes! put it down. and the next measures exactly the same, rising and rising c to d to e, up to the dominant chord. do you see?}
<A>__{as salieri writes, mozart sings the ostinato from the beginning, but the unaccompanied strings overwhelm his voice on the soundtrack, playing the first six bars of their agitated accompaniment. they stop.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{that's wonderful!}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{yes, yes go on. the voca me. suddenly sotto voce. write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. voca me cum benedictis. call me among the blessed.}
<A>__{he is now sitting bolt upright, hushed and inspired.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{c major. sopranos and altos in thirds. altos on c. sopranos above.}
<P>__{(singing the alto part)}
<D>__{vo ca, vo ca me, vo ca me cum be ne dic tis.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{sopranos up to f on the second 'voca'?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{yes, and on 'dictis'.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{yes!}
<A>__{he writes feverishly.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{and underneath, just violins arpeggio.}
<A>__{he sings the violin figure under the voca me (bars 7,8,9).}
<C>__{mozart}
<P>__{(speaking)}
<D>__{the descending scale in eighth notes, and then back suddenly to the fire again.}
<A>__{he sings the ostinato phrase twice.}
<C>__{mozart}
<P>__{(speaking)}
<D>__{and that's it. do you have it?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{you go fast!}
<C>__{mozart}
<P>__{(urgently)}
<D>__{do you have it?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{then let me hear it. all of it. the whole thing from the beginning now!}
<A>__{the entire confutatis bursts over the room, as mozart snatches the manuscript pages from salieri and reads from it, singing. salieri sits looking on in wondering astonishment. the music continues right through the following scenes, to the end of the movement.}
