<L>__{exterior belvedere day}
<A>__{ramirez and jack walk together on the belvedere which is an observation area with a railing around it, overlooking the abandoned prison. in between the belvedere and the prison is a field which is almost completely barren except for one tree. it sits down below. in the distance, we see a snow mobile approach with its lights on. just then, jack takes a pocket sized remote transmitter and slips it into the front pocket of ramirez's jacket, turning it on as he does.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it's a transmitter.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{target practice. you're the target.}
<A>__{jack quickly moves away from ramirez. as ramirez moves, he notices that the snow mobile changes direction as well, and continues to home in on him. and then there is a second snow mobile. and then a third, all of them coming straight for him. he starts to run. the snow mobiles turn and continue bearing down on him, driving him closer toward the railing. we see the snow mobiles are controlled by radio antennas, evidently homing in on his transmitter. jack, who has moved quite a ways off, pulls out a beretta and sets it on the rail. we see on the snow mobiles, a lit up remote device.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{if you shoot out the receivers, they'll stop. there are ten rounds in this clip. the first two are live, the next three dummy, then three live, two dummy.}
<A>__{ramirez stands like a deer in the headlights for an instant and then goes running for the gun. he cannot make it to the gun before the first snow mobile barrels down upon him. he is right against the rail now and goes diving into the snow. the snow mobile goes directly over him and crashes through the rail, falling down to the field below. ramirez is up and running, grabs the gun, fires two rounds and misses, then hits three dummy rounds which click away as the second snow mobile draws closer. then he fires and hits a headlight, then fires and misses, then fires and hits the remote device. that snow mobile stops in its tracks. the third now barrels down on ramirez. he clicks off two dummy rounds and just before the snow mobile hits him, a shot rings out. the receiver shatters and we see jack standing with the smoking gun with which he has just saved ramirez's life.}
