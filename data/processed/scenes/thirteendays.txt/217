<D>__{it crossed the line hours ago.}
<A>__{admiral anderson, on the phone on the level below, is tense.}
<C>__{admiral anderson}
<D>__{hail them again.}
<C>__{the president }
<D>__{keep us posted, bob.}
<A>__{mcnamara leans against the wall, closes his eyes in exhaustion and stress. and when he opens the, we pan around}
<T>__{to reveal:}
<A>__{a g d like view of the flag plot, covered with hundreds of ships, planes and markings. mcnamara stares out at the bewildering tangle of symbols, living men behind each one. each tangle of red and blue symbols a powderkeg. a g dlike view indeed. and it is far more than any one mere man could keep control of. and he begins to realize it.}
<C>__{mcnamara}
<D>__{we're kidding ourselves...}
<A>__{and not only that, in his bleary, sleep deprived fog, he begins to understand something happening down there. the camera moves over the enormous map, over the scrolling cryptic numerology. the buzz of radio communications bleeds in from the background. the overhead platform swivels on its motor, like the vast arm of some fate writing god as the watch officer on it updates the movements of the ships. mcnamara stares, at the verge of grasping something. through the door crack of genius, he has the glimpse of some grander thing, some grander design.}

<C>__{mcnamara}
<D>__{admiral, i asked you a question.}
<A>__{anderson holds the phone aside, turns around again, looks up at him, impatient. his answer is hard, cold, dangerous.}
<C>__{admiral anderson}
<D>__{we're going to follow the rules of engagement. the rules of engagement which the president has approved and signed in his order of october 23rd.}
<A>__{anderson listens again to the phone.}
<C>__{admiral anderson }
<D>__{yes, captain, you may proceed. clear your guns.}
