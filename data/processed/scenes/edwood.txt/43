<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior ed's apartment day}
<A>__{cu on a royal typewriter. ed's hands whirl across the portable typewriter, frantically feeding in pages as fast as be can type. we pull out. ed sits on the bed, typing. he's a blur of activity, juggling a cigarette, coffee, and a telephone, while he writes.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{but bunny, you're perfect for this job! you're so good at organizing.}
<A>__{his adrenalin is pumping. ed pours some booze into his coffee.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{you know these people. i need all the transsexuals and transvestites you can get.}
<P>__{(he sucks on his cigarette)}
<D>__{no, i don't care if they're not actors. i want realism. i want this film to tell the truth ! i've waited my whole life for this shot, and i'm not gonna blow it.}
<A>__{there's a knock at the door. ed carries the phone on a long cord and answers it. bela hurries in, smiling broadly.}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{eddie, you got a new movie for me?!}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{yeah, it's gonna be a great picture! you'll love your character!}
<P>__{(back into the phone)}
<D>__{bunny, bela's here. look, hit the bars, work some parties, and get me transvestites! i need transvestites !}
<A>__{ed hangs up and resumes typing. bela is puzzled.}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{eddie, what kind of movie is this?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{well, it's about how people have two personalities. the side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.}
<C>__{bela}
<P>__{(delighted)}
<D>__{oh, like jekyll and hyde! ah, i've always wanted to play jekyll and hyde! i'm looking forward to this production.}
<A>__{ed stops typing. he pours bela a drink.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{ehh, your part's a little different. you're like the god that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything.}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{well... you control everyone's fate. you're like the puppetmaster.}
<C>__{bela}
<P>__{(getting it)}
<D>__{ah, so i pull the strings!}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{yeah. you pull the strings }
<P>__{(he suddenly gets a look)}
<D>__{"pull the strings"... hey, that's pretty good!}
<A>__{ed quickly starts typing again.}
