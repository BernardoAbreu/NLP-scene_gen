<D>__{no question, huh?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{no, its why did she ?}
<A>__{he forces himself to look at the body again, his own face full of the unanswerable question. he looks her up and down, then his eyes stop. he focuses on something, a look of surprise coming into his eyes. roy's pov: cu, the body's hands, crossed over the stomach, the wrists crossed, the palms down, the clear backs of both hands visible. cu, roy. he knows. sharpness comes back into his expression.}
