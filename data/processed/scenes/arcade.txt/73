<L>__{interior dante's inferno night}
<A>__{alex dangles from the skylight, a good eight feet from the floor.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(warily)}
<D>__{are you there?}
<B>__{her p.o.v.}
<A>__{the inferno is a world of threatening shapes and shadows. and nick is nowhere to be seen. alex steels herself and drops to the floor. she stands, a bit shaky, and cautiously moves around a cluster of video games.}
<B>__{nick}
<A>__{is standing on the other side, staring at a game screen which pulses with a dim light. alex approaches, putting a hand on his shoulder. he turns.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{alex...}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you didn't hear me?}
<A>__{nick shakes his head. alex leans forward to see what he's looking at.}
<B>__{on the screen}
<A>__{fractals are unfolding. it's mesmerizing.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{stop looking at it.}
<A>__{nick shuts his eyes, pulling away from the screen. he shakes his head, trying to clear his thoughts.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{shit...it's like a trance or something...}
<P>__{(breathes)}
<D>__{okay. i'm fine. really.}
<A>__{it's at that moment that nick and alex hear the voices.}
<B>__{video screens}
<A>__{all around them flicker on, static laced images fading in. they are the faces of their friends...greg, laurie, and many others. all those that have disappeared. the voices fade in and out, merging with one another, tinged with the same mechanical edge of arcade's voice.}
<C>__{voices}
<P>__{(eerie)}
<D>__{nick...alex...save us...}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(horrified)}
<D>__{oh god...}
<A>__{nick grabs alex and pulls her into the canter of the room.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{put it out of your head, alex. it's just trying to psyche us out.}
<A>__{despite nick's words, we can tell that the voices are having a disheartening effect on him.}
<B>__{the arcade}
<A>__{prototype stands in front of them now, and surprisingly, the machine is not on. the eyes in the leering black face are quite dead. around alex and nick, the faces of their friends continue to fade in and out, casting the whole room in a strange shimmering blue light. nick moves to the back of the machine and opens the access panel, revealing the internal circuitry. he pulls a small penlight from his pocket and flips it on.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{what are you looking for?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{a way to hook this helmet into the game. i'm sure there are interfaces...}
<A>__{nick's p.o.v. and indeed there are. parallel interfaces, where you might hook a printer cable into a computer. nick takes the cable from the cyberhelmet and secures it into one of the interfaces.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{there. now we're wired in.}
<A>__{he stands and moves around front, pressing the "start" button of the game. nothing happens. he presses it again. nothing.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{is the game plugged in?}
<A>__{nick checks. it is.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{i don't understand. it wants us to play the game. it's been taunting us ...}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{put in a quarter.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{it can turn itself on, alex! it doesn't need a quarter.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{yes it does. don't you see? we have to play by the rules. that's what it wants.}
<A>__{nick rifles through his pockets. he doesn't have a quarter. neither does alex.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{change machine.}
<A>__{nick moves over to the change machine and picks up a nearby chair. he smashes the chair into the face of the machine again and again, obliterating the lock. nick opens the front of the machine and tears out the coin box, spilling quarters all over the floor. he grabs a handful and returns.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{there.}
<A>__{he shoves one in arcade's coin slot and pulls on the cybergloves.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{two players, nick. you need to put in another quarter.}
<A>__{nick straps the goggles over his eyes.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you're not coming, alex.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{yes i am...}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(snapping)}
<D>__{i know how to do this! i'm good at these games. you never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{and what if something happens to you? am i suppose to go in after you alone?!}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{no. if you're smart, you run like hell.}
<A>__{alex grabs a second quarter and shoves it in the coin slot.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i'm going.}
<A>__{nick stares at her a moment, then nods tiredly. she reaches for the second pair of cybergloves and pulls them on.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you don't get it, do you?}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(strapping on goggles)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i don't want anything to happen to you. i care about you.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i already have a boyfriend, nick.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i know.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it sucks.}
<A>__{the two of them stand there a moment, looking at one another. after a moment, nick laughs tiredly.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what can i say?}
<P>__{(pulls on the cyberhelmet)}
<D>__{tough being a hero, isn't it?}
<A>__{nick reaches out for the joy stick and hits the "start" button.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(grim)}
<D>__{here goes nothing.}
<A>__{as before, the screen comes to life. darkness and sparks. then we hear the breathing. arcade's face spins into view, grinning at alex and nick.}
<C>__{arcade}
<D>__{nick. alex. i missed you so much. all your friends are here.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<C>__{arcade}
<D>__{any time.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{we know what you are.}
<C>__{arcade}
<D>__{a heartless monster, of course.}
<P>__{(incredibly evil)}
<D>__{oh save me, alex, save me from myself.}
<A>__{arcade laughs and it's not a sound you'd want to hear twice.}
<B>__{the lightbeam}
<A>__{clicks on, playing over their faces and analyzing their features.}
<B>__{on screen}
<A>__{arcade's face spins away and computer generated versions of alex and nick appear. as before, they are suited up in video game armor, each carrying a thrasher board.}
<C>__{arcade}
<D>__{kiss reality goodbye.}
<A>__{the video versions of nick and alex hop onto their thrasher boards and the world around them curls in upon itself. the process is similar to what we've seen before, but even more extreme. lights and sounds are pouring out of the arcade machine in almost unbearable intensities. it seems as if the "real" world is going to be shaken apart.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(over noise)}
<D>__{hold on!}
<C>__{arcade}
<D>__{see you on the other side.}
<B>__{another flash of light and...}
<A>__{alex and nick disappear from the real world completely. their equipment, gloves and goggles, fall to the floor, empty. they've been physically sucked inside the game! the light from the screen dies down now and everything is oddly quiet.}
<B>__{on screen}
<A>__{boom! suddenly a circuit grid is rushing up to meet them! (note: as we move through each level, video legends will appear on the screen as title cards, enhancing the effect that we are actually inside a video game.) the words "level one blood red sky" flash across the screen and we...}
