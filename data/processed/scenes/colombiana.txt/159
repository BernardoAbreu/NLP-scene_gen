<L>__{interior villa night}
<A>__{william, holding the two guns of the dead guards in front of him, makes his way down stairs, past two more dead guards. growing more and more nervous by the moment, he tries a light switch on the wall, nothing. the only light comes from the ambient glow of the aquarium below. he reaches the bottom of the stairs.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{anybody?}
<A>__{no answer. he crosses the aquarium floor, and when he is right in the middle...}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{stop right there.}
<A>__{cat comes out of the dark. in her hand, a silencer fitted pistol.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{doesn't matter who i am.}
<A>__{he pulls the trigger on his gun. click, click, click. he tries the other one. again click click click.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{i want you exactly where you are.}
<A>__{and then, without warning, she puts a bullet in both his knees.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{arrrggghhhh!}
<A>__{he falls to the floor. the blood starts to seep out onto the glass. the sharks swim back and forth.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{whatever they paid you, i will double it!}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{you know the thing about sharks. you can swim with them all day and they will just ignore you, but put one drop of blood in the water and they become your biggest admirers.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{please. i will give you anything you want. don't kill me!}
<C>__{cat}
<D>__{i'm not going to kill you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{they are.}
<A>__{she fires three shots into the glass square he is kneeling on. the glass shatters. william falls into the water. grabs onto the squares on either side and props himself up. his blood runs down into the clear water. cat turns and walks toward the door.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{please! please!}
<A>__{he struggles frantically to pull himself out. cat exits. and then the sharks hit. wham! and hit. and hit. and hit.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{please! help! help!}
<A>__{he is violently dragged under.}
<C>__{close on}
<A>__{the front page of a newspaper with a picture of the remains of william under the headline: sharks eat shark. the newspaper drops to reveal richard at his desk.}
