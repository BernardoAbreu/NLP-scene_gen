<L>__{interior john's mobile home day}
<A>__{john is bent over his printer, jiggling the front end, trying to open it. tapping it on the side. no luck.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{nope. not going to see richard whatever his name is. john k. butzin, author, doesn't need to stand in line anymore. no, sir. this soon to be best selling writer is spending every minute, every dollar, on promoting roaring lion.}
<A>__{try as he might, john can't open up his printer. sigrid appears. leans in. effortlessly opens up the printer. takes the cartridge from john. snaps it in. shuts the lid. done. john grunts his thanks.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{strudel, check my sales ranking again.}
<A>__{sigrid steps to the computer and taps a couple keys. stares at the screen.}
<C>__{sigrid}
<P>__{(reading out loud)}
<D>__{1,644,973 . . .}
<A>__{not quite the hoped for response. turns quiet inside the mobile home. john clears his throat.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{wow. look how far i've moved up already.}
<A>__{sigrid types again. reads off the screen.}
<C>__{sigrid}
<D>__{john grisham. 12.}
<A>__{forget about john for the moment. watch sigrid as her eyes dart around from the screen, to john in the chair, out the window. back again. this is the moment. sigrid gets it now: john k. butzin is not the author he pretends to be. very quiet in the mobile home.}
