<L>__{interior unfinished house 4 evening}
<A>__{the whole house is illuminated. she looks up to see four faces looking down at her. chuckie points the gaze of a powerful flashlight directly into her eyes. the beam almost blinds her. she tries to look away but chuckie focuses it right in her eyes.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{peek a boo!}
<A>__{she shrinks back towards the wall. her mouth feels dry, so dry. tomas lifts several planks up and casts them away so they can see her. she's cornered. chuckie then lowers the flashlights direction and sweeps it voyeuristically down across her body. the light lingers on her breasts. huey whistles appreciatively, picks the game back up from the parking lot.}
<C>__{huey}
<D>__{yo left without yo goodbye kiss.}
<A>__{the light sweeps past huey's hips. the sound of a zipper. the light sweeps back up onto della.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{you a window shopper little brother. you ain't never even done the old in and out before.}
<A>__{waves of pain spasm through della's shoulder. the boys snigger.}
<C>__{huey}
<D>__{imma just a young playa tryin' to put my bid in.}
<A>__{tomas leans down towards della. chuckie moves the flashlight to illuminate them both. tomas drains the last dregs from a bottle of bud, tosses the empty bottle down into the foundations. it rolls into the darkness. della shudders. she clutches the lug wrench against her coat behind the tool box and tries to disappear into the wall.}
<C>__{tomas}
<D>__{don't worry, when we done wit you we send yo back in yo trunk to mr. podunk.}
<A>__{tomas reaches down and pulls della up to standing by the coat collar. he then yanks the coat down over her shoulder. the white shirt she wears underneath is damp with sweat making the form of her breasts very clear. chuckie keeps the light focused right on her. tomas slides his index finger down across della's neck towards her breasts. della claws at tomas' face with the nails of her free hand. he staggers to the side holding his cheek and cursing. her chewed nails haven't left any dents, but she stunned him. the others laugh. she shrugs the coat back over her shoulders and pulls it tight across herself, once again clasping the toolbox close to her side.}
<C>__{tomas }
<D>__{don't want to play nice? puta!}
<A>__{he moves towards her, face twisted with hate, arm raised.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{back off five minutes, my ghetto brother.}
<A>__{tomas glares at della, then lowers his arm. spits on the ground instead. turns back to the boys. chuckie moves forwards and focuses on della's box?}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{what's with the man size crast?}
<A>__{della doesn't answer.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{you running with the family jewels?}
<A>__{della still doesn't answer.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{you rob a bank this morning, della?}
<A>__{della remains determinedly mute.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{least yo learned something tonight della honey?}
<C>__{vinh}
<D>__{yeah, like how to quit mouthing if you wanna avoid drama.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{you must be wondering how we come to know your name.}
<A>__{chuckie giggles. della shivers.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{you screwed up della myers. left your purse in the ford.}
<A>__{chuckie holds up her driving licence and examines it.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{what a shitty photo!}
<A>__{chuckie nods to vinh. vinh passes his lighter to chuckie. chuckie lights the licence on fire. the plastic burns black and toxic. the flame annihilates della's name, her date of birth, her face. pieces of plastic unfurl and drift up through the empty windows and doors of the unfinished house.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{guess you won't be needing it no more.}
<A>__{della stares defiantly, fighting back the internal nausea caused by this symbolically brutal act. chuckie maneuvers the light back in her eyes then right back on his own menacing face. then, back again on her face. she becomes disoriented.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{so what's in the box?}
<A>__{della remains mute, looks away from the beam.}
<C>__{huey}
<D>__{yo think she carrying the big notes, maybe some ice?}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{nah, it ain't about to rain diamonds, huey. but maybe she cashed in her life savings. planned to take off, start a new life.}
<A>__{della tries to swallow but her throat is too dry.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{that right della?}
<C>__{tomas}
<D>__{you got enough scratch in there to grease us up with?}
<A>__{she knows there is nothing that would buy them off and the knowledge sinks like a stone deep into her gut. chuckie follows her face with the beam. she tries to dodge its glare in her eyes. but he maneuvers it like a surveillance camera. his voice takes on a meanness that makes the back of her neck tingle.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{open it.}
<A>__{they crowd closer toward her. dark forms with eyes glinting. their voices echoing.}
<C>__{vinh}
<D>__{open the box else we put you in trauma.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{open it!}
<A>__{della all but screams.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{okay! i will open it.}
<A>__{della's brain races. her hands move slowly. she rests the lug wrench in her left palm under the base of the tool box and with her right hand unsnaps the catch. she holds the far end of the lid up to shield her right hand from the beam as she slips it inside the box. a prayer plays silently across her lips as her fingers feel the cool steel and shape of the small crescent wrench. she curls them around its handle and grips tight. a surge of nervous energy courses through her veins.}
<C>__{tomas}
<D>__{she ain't got nuthin'. let's just take that pussy and git going.}
<A>__{he moves towards her. in a flash, she withdraws the crescent wrench. she cocks her wrist back and hurls the tool, snaps it just like her daddy taught her to play baseball. the wrench flies up and across the house. with a crunch, it catches chuckie right in the collar bone, right side. he screams. drops the flashlight. drops to his knees holding his throat. della snaps the tool box shut and makes a run for it. she throws herself up onto the first floor and darts between tomas and huey. huey lunges for her but trips over a loose plank, lands with his face down, biting on the plank's edge. della catches a peripheral glimpse of tomas leaping towards her, but his leading foot slams down instead onto the back of huey's neck. grinds huey's face into the plank with a hideous thud. huey's neck snaps back smiley style. huey's scream gurgles into the night. huey's body falls through the space in the floorboards landing with a thud in the foundations below. tomas falls away, cursing in horror.}
<C>__{tomas }
<D>__{maricon!}
<A>__{della makes a run for the doorway. she jumps down onto the muddy lot and heads off across the development. the darkness quickly swallows her. behind her, vinh slumps through the house.}
<C>__{vinh}
<D>__{what the fuck, niggaz?}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{shut up.}
<C>__{vinh}
<D>__{you hurt?}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{shut the fuck up.}
<A>__{chuckie slides down to be beside huey in the foundations.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{and don't be using the n word. you ain't representing. got it. that right huey? huey. get up huey. huey get up!}
<A>__{tomas staggers up to standing.}
<C>__{tomas}
<D>__{jesus hijo de maria el virgene.}
<C>__{vinh}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{vinh moves towards chuckie who is crouched over huey.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{my little brother.}
<A>__{tomas approaches. he pushes chuckie gently out of the way so he can see. he stares down at huey's bloody meshed face. tomas staggers backwards and crosses himself.}
<C>__{tomas}
<D>__{mamacita! madre de dios!}
<A>__{chuckie punches tomas' leg.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{you tread on my boy's face. you killed him.}
<C>__{tomas}
<D>__{i didn't kill him. i didn't kill no one.}
<A>__{tomas pushes chuckie backwards.}
<C>__{tomas }
<D>__{she did it. she killed him.}
<A>__{chuckie and tomas stare at each other.}
<C>__{tomas }
<D>__{i'm gonna cross that bitch out.}
