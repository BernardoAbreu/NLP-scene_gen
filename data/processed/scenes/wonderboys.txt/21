<L>__{exterior parking lot thaw hall (campus)}
<A>__{as sporadic applause wafts from the high windowpanes of thaw hall, grady leans into the galaxie's trunk, creates a space between the tuba and a zippered suitcase.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{james totters forward, arms hooked under poe's front legs looking like a sorry marathon dancer. grady frowns, limps forward, and takes the hind legs.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{he's still a little warm.}
<A>__{they lay him down, push him deep into the trunk until there is a sound like a pencil snapping.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{yuck.}
<A>__{grady grabs crabtree's garment bag, frisks the pockets.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{that's a. big trunk. it fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.}
<C>__{grady}
<P>__{(searching)}
<D>__{that's just what they used to say in the ads. come on, crabtree, i know you're holding...}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{whose tuba is that anyway?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{miss sloviak's.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{can i ask you something about her?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{she is. ah. here we go...}
<A>__{grady unravels a pair of boxer shorts, finds an airplane size bottle of jack daniels, then grabs another pair of boxers.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{oh. so. is is your friend crabtree is he gay?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{most of the time he is, james. some of the time he isn't. now what do we have here?}
<A>__{grady rattles a prescription bottle, then shakes out a pair of white pills, each etched with a tiny numeral 3.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{looks like ...our old friend mr. codeine. that should take the pinch out of my ankle.}
<P>__{(handing the bottle to james)}
<D>__{have one.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{no thanks. i'm fine without them.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{right. that's why you were standing in the chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight. you're fine, all right, you're fit as a fucking fiddle.}
<A>__{grady opens the tiny bottle of jack with his teeth, drinks down two number 3's, then looks at james.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i'm sorry, james. i'm sorry i said that.}
<A>__{recklessly, james takes a pill, tosses it in his mouth, and tips back the tiny bottle of jack. half a second later, he spits it all out. grady looks down, peels the soggy pill from the lapel of his jacket.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{how 'bout we try that again.}
