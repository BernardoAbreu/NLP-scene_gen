<A>__{the "smoochy show" is in the middle of a taping. the smoochyland band is playing a fast, jazzy number ("doin' the jiggy ziggy") as smoochy, the rhinettes, and several kids dance frenetically. the kids in the bleachers are in hysterics as smoochy shakes his body spastically. the song finally ends. the kids in the bleachers jump to their feet, cheering and applauding.}
<C>__{smoochy}
<D>__{boy, all that jiggyin' and ziggyin' sure makes a fella hungry! now if only i had my super duper, super secret, super special...}
<A>__{the kids in the bleachers erupt in unison:}
<C>__{kids}
<D>__{magic cookie bag!}
<C>__{smoochy}
<D>__{right o riffic!}
<P>__{(looks skyward)}
<D>__{magic cookie bag, i command thee! come to your lord and master!}
<A>__{the lights dim as the smoochyland band plays the "2001 theme." smoochy's magic cookie bag is lowered from the ceiling by a filament wire. the kids go crazy.}
<C>__{smoochy}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{'lookie, lookie, lookie, here comes the cookies! fresh and organic, no need to panic! right from the soil, no tropical oils! sweetened with juice, for an energy boost! fiber galore, you'll be askin' for more...'}
<B>__{angle on nora}
<A>__{she looks pissed, but then looks over at the kids in the bleachers. their faces are filled with laughter. for the first time she feels the connection smoochy has with them.}
<B>__{angle on randolph}
<A>__{he peers out from his hiding place backstage. his eyes widen with delight as the magic cookie bag continues its descent.}
<B>__{angle on smoochy}
<A>__{the cookie bag finally reaches smoochy. he holds the bag high above his head in a religious ceremonial fashion as the rhinettes and the kids crowd around him.}
<C>__{smoochy}
<D>__{oooh... just the smell of unprocessed flour makes my tummy do somersaults!}
<B>__{angle on randolph}
<C>__{randolph}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{whatever that means, you fucking retard.}
<B>__{smoochy}
<A>__{his puffy orange hand reaches for the bag's clasp as the music reaches its crescendo.}
<B>__{randolph}
<A>__{he's practically shaking as he suppresses an insane laugh.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{give 'em a cookie... give 'em a cookie...}
<B>__{smoochy}
<A>__{he reaches into the bag, and with a grand flourish, pulls out a flaming red penis cookie. the cookie is somewhat misshapen and not perfectly formed. smoochy gets a big grin.}
<C>__{smoochy}
<D>__{wow! look at this cookie, kids! a rocket ship!}
<A>__{the kids "ooh" and "ahh."}
<B>__{angle on randolph}
<A>__{he looks confused.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{what a special day with such special cookies!}
<B>__{back on smoochy}
<A>__{smoochy pretends to "zoom" the penis cookie through the air.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{rrrrrrrr! look at me, kids! i'm flying to the moon! i'm flying to mars! i'm flying to }
<A>__{randolph, whose face is now bright red, can't take it anymore. he runs onto the stage. he grabs the rocket cookie from smoochy.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{are you fucking blind?! it's a cock! not a space ship! cock! cock!}
