<L>__{interior living room continuous}
<A>__{the living room is sparsely furnished a sofa, a coffee table, a bookcase cluttered with a handful of paperbooks, a couple of boardgames, a dying cactus, etc. a crappy old fifteen inch t.v. on a t.v. tray. we see this for a moment before... a paint splattered cloth is unfurled filling the screen. it gently floats down, revealing a painter and his shopping cart overloaded with supplies. he's dressed in paint splattered clothes. a paint splattered red sox cap is pulled low over his eyes, obscuring his face. beth stares in disbelief. without seeing her, the painter backs up, his attention focused on spreading the dropcloth.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{sid}
<P>__{(not looking up)}
<D>__{the painter.}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(agitated)}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{painting.}
<A>__{the painter looks up from the drop cloth, ready to deal with this obstacle. he freezes. his face lights up. it's sid.}
<C>__{sid}
<P>__{(extremely pleased)}
<D>__{well, good morning...}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(recognizing him)}
<D>__{you...}
<C>__{sid}
<P>__{(extending a hand)}
<D>__{sid. nice to see you again.}
<A>__{beth stares in agitated disbelief. with his untaken extended hand, he pulls a long strip of masking tape from a roll around his wrist, masking one side of the door frame from top to bottom.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{why are you here?}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{realty office likes a fresh coat between tenants.}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(pointedly)}
<D>__{we're still here.}
<A>__{he stands on his tiptoes and puts a strip of masking tape on the top edge of the doorframe.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{i've done this house before.}
<P>__{(admiringly)}
<D>__{i did a nice job.}
<A>__{he masks the remaining side of the door frame.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{can't you come back tomorrow?}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{tomorrow's sunday.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{yeah...?}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{the new people move in on sunday.}
<P>__{(conversationally)}
<D>__{where are you moving to?}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(wearily)}
<D>__{billings, montana.}
<A>__{sid moves to a window.}
<C>__{sid}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{it can't be worse than enfield, arizona.}
<A>__{sid pulls a strip of tape off the roll.}
<C>__{sid}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i've lived in enfield my whole life.}
<A>__{he holds out the end of the masking tape.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{could you hold this?}
<A>__{beth takes it. he walks backwards, easing a long strip of tape off the roll.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{i use this to mask. have you ever used masking tape to mask?}
<A>__{he tears the tape off the roll and sticks it to the top of the baseboard in one corner.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{no. i haven't.}
<A>__{crouched, he waddles across the room toward beth, applying the masking tape to the baseboard. he gets to beth, stands up, takes the tape off her fingers, and presses it into place.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{a house like this, it's real easy. hardly needs a paint job.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{you can skip it. i won't tell.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{it needs a fresh coat...}
<A>__{he hands her the end of the tape again and begins another baseboard.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{...a little color.}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(naturally curious)}
<D>__{what color is it gonna be?}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{off white.}
<A>__{he goes along the floor pressing the masking tape to the baseboard.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{it's already off white.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{no. it's white. it's just dirty.}
<A>__{beth looks at the walls. he's right.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{now if it was my house, i would choose a color...}
<A>__{beth kneels down, holding the tape, as he arrives at her end of the wall.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{i would not choose off white.}
<A>__{beth holds out the tape. they are kneeling next to each other.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{what would you choose?}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{the color of your eyes.}
<P>__{(pause, without looking)}
<D>__{hazel.}
<A>__{beth stares at sid. sid looks to beth. smiling, he takes the tape from her fingers.}
