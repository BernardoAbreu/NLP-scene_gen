<D>__{that's him. raymond barnell.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{could you?}
<A>__{boyle moves toward the head and pulls back the covering. ted recoils. cam leans in for a closer look.}
<C>__{cam}
<D>__{ouch. that's gotta hurt.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{so what's your line on this?}
<C>__{detective boyle}
<D>__{just what it looks like. wolves got him. maybe a grizzly with insomnia, but we didn't find any tracks.}

<D>__{mind telling me what you're doing?}
<C>__{cam}
<D>__{they gave every claims team a video camera last quarter... you'd be amazed at how it cuts down on litigation. we had this case two months ago where this mother of six was claiming...}
<C>__{detective boyle}
