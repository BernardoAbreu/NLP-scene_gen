<L>__{interior globe hotel room 44 minutes later (day)}
<A>__{cole sits on the lumpy bed in the dingy room, watching railly pace back and forth like a mad woman.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i thought i was in...prison again.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{just like that? you were in prison?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{no, not really. it's...it's in my mind. like you said.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{you disappeared! one minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. did you run through the woods?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i don't know i don't remember.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{the boy in the well. how did you know that was just a hoax?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{it was? i didn't...know.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{james, you said he was hiding in the barn...}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i think i saw a tv show like that when i was a kid. where a boy...}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{it wasn't a tv show! it was real!}
<A>__{cole looks at her. she's really upset.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{well, maybe that kid saw the same tv show and copied it. listen, you were right, it's all in my head. i'm mentally ill, i imagine all that stuff. i know they're not real, i can trick them, make them do what i want. i just worked on them in my head and i got back here. i can get better. i can stay here.}
<A>__{railly pulls a photo from her purse, shows it to cole. it's the uncropped picture from her book, the photo of jose in wwi with a fuzzy image of cole on the edge of the frame,}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{what does this mean to you?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{...i had a dream about...something like that.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{you had a bullet from world war one in your leg, james! how did it get there?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{you said i had delusions that i created a world you said you could explain everything...}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{well, i can't. ... i mean...i'm trying to. i can't believe that everything we do or say has already happened, that we can't change what's going to happen, that i'm one of the three billion people who are going to die...soon.}
<A>__{cole stands, moves close to her.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i want to be here. in this time. with you. i want to become...become a whole person. i want this to be the present. i want the future to be unknown.}
<C>__{railly}
<P>__{(sudden hopeful idea!)}
<D>__{james...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number! you tried to call and...}
<A>__{wham! the door flies open, kicked violently, the flimsy lock not holding. a menacing figure stands in the doorway. wallace. a wiry biker type with jail house tattoos and mean eyes. cole and railly are too stunned to say anything as wallace looks them over coldly, insolently, then advances on railly.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{this is my territory, bitch!}
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(confused, turns to railly)}
<D>__{is this real or is this one of my delusions?}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{this is definitely real:}
<P>__{(to wallace)}
<D>__{excuse me, i think we have a little misunderstanding here...}
<A>__{wallace smashes railly in the face. she flies back against the wall and onto the floor as wallace spins around to cole who is stepping toward him, but wallace is now holding a knife}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{what're you some kind of tough guy? you wanna be a hero? you gonna try and mess with me? come on...}
<A>__{a beat. cole puts his hands up placatingly as he backs around wallace and moves to railly, whose eye is already swelling.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{now that's a smart boy. but you, honey, you think you can go 'round me and peddle your fancy ass in this part of town, you bet your life we got what i would call a major goddamn misunderstandin'.}
<A>__{railly reaches a hand up to cole for assistance, but, he grabs her purse instead, swings it around, smashes wallace in the face with it, then grabs the pimp's arm and snaps it like it was a twig! the knife clatters to the floor as wallace yelps in pain and cole slams him to the floor, straddles his chest, retrieves the near by knife, and presses it sharply against wallace's neck.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{james don't!}
<A>__{cole hesitates.}
<C>__{wallace}
<P>__{(eyes bulging)}
<D>__{you...heard...her. don't do it, man.}
<C>__{railly}
<P>__{(gets up, looks around)}
<D>__{put him in the closet, ... but get his money first.}
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(amazed)}
<D>__{you want me to rob him?}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{i...i...we need cash, james.}
<A>__{a shadow. railly turns toward the door and glimpses a face disappearing, then hears shouts from the hallway...}
<C>__{shouts }
<D>__{they're killing him! call the cops.}
<A>__{being very careful not to move his neck, wallace reaches into his pocket and produces a thick roll of bills, which railly grabs.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{you two are crazy. i got friends. you put me in a closet, they're gonna be really pissed.}
<A>__{cole moves off wallace and, keeping the knife close, yanks him to his teeth while railly hurries to the window and looks out. her pov: a fire escape leads down into an alley. railly turns just in time to see cole shove wallace into the bathroom, follow him in, slam the door behind them, and lock it.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{james, no!}
