<L>__{interior rex restaurant night}
<A>__{vivian comes out of the ladies room. she walks forward past the maitre'd's station. she stops. she takes a breath... and then walks forward.}
<L>__{interior rex another angle looking down}
<A>__{vivian moves down a marble starircase, through the elegant restaurant toward a far table. her beauty and natural grace draw approving stares. she is like a queen moving through a ballroom. at a secluded table, edward sits in conversation with two men. james kross, in his early 70's, a bulky self made millionaire industrialist. sitting next to him is his son and second in command, david kross, a handsome man in his early thirties. all of them rise as vivian comes to the table. david kross holds out vivian's chair for her. surprised, she nods her thanks. in front of her is an enormous placesetting. she smiles down at the utensils, filled with confidence. waiters have placed a delicate salad down in front of each of them. vivian proudly reaches for her salad fork. but then she sees that kross has picked up the fork closest to his plate and is digging into his salad with that. vivian looks to see what edward will do. he doesn't seem interested in eating yet. neither does david kross. feeling a sudden panic, vivian puts her fork down.}
<C>__{kross}
<D>__{so young man, i understand you are trying to take over my company.}
<A>__{a moment. the abruptness of the question takes edward back for a moment. but then he almost smiles.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{please don't patronize me, mr. kross. our ages mean nothing here.}
<A>__{kross and david look at each other.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{mr. harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock. we also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{twenty five percent.}
<C>__{kross}
<D>__{mr. harris, i built kross enterprises myself. i know every man who ever worked there by his first name. i know their wives... and their children. if your intention is to take over my company and turn it into a glorified real estate deal, think again.}
<A>__{edward, thankfully, now reaches for his salad fork and begins to eat. relieved, vivian picks up hers. they all eat for a moment.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{what do you suggest, mr. kross?}
<A>__{waiters approach, some to clear the salad plates, some to put down the next course. vivian, thinking she's got to finish, quickly stuffs her mouth with the rest of her salad. she is reluctant to let the waiter take her fork.}
<C>__{kross}
<D>__{what would it take to buy our stock back? name your price.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{to get me in a mood to sell double what i paid. but your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{we're on the verge of closing a large navy contract. double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares. we would give you a promissory note...}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{you're not getting any navy contracts.}
<A>__{vivian can see that both father and son are stunned by this news.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{there's no way you could know that.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{but i do know. i also know your lines of credit are over extended. if i don't buy your company, someone else will...}
<P>__{(looking up)}
<D>__{ah, the escargot.}
<A>__{escargot are put down in front of everyone. vivian stares at them dubiously. she picks up what she assumes is the next "right" fork. she picks up a snail. the two do not fit. flustered, she doesn't know what to do. no one else seems to be eating. and now a waiter comes and places escargot forks at each place. vivian picks it up with a sigh of relief.}
<C>__{vivian}
<P>__{(softly, to the waiter)}
<D>__{scume me, what are these things?}
<C>__{waiter}
<P>__{(bending to whisper)}
<D>__{escargot, mademoiselle.}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(leaning close to whisper)}
<D>__{snails.}
<A>__{vivian stares at them, horrified. she, like james and david kross, no longer seem interested in eating. edward eats with pleasure.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{mr. kross, i'm not here to sell you my stock. on the contrary, i'm here to buy yours.}
<C>__{kross}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{you've got a lot of nerve.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{no. what i have is a lot of money.}
<C>__{kross}
<D>__{i know all about you, mr. harris. when you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing. even the pension funds are stripped clean. the last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{what i did with those companies was perfectly legal.}
<C>__{kross}
<D>__{i don't question the legality of what you do. it's your morality that makes me sick. i will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(angry now)}
<D>__{it is not your company. it's a public company. and i am going to acquire it. either i buy from the other stock holders, or i buy from you.}
<A>__{vivian struggles with her escargot.}
<C>__{edward }
<D>__{i would suggest that you and your board cooperate with me, rather than fight a battle you don't have the ammunition to win.}
<A>__{vivian suddenly zings her snail across the table. everyone looks to her.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{slippery little suckers...}
<A>__{kross rises.}
<C>__{kross}
<D>__{if you'll excuse me young lady, mr. harris...}
<P>__{(turns to david)}
<D>__{deal with this, david, you know where we stand. i need to go someplace and puke.}
<A>__{he rises. he exits.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(to edward and vivian)}
<D>__{men like my father built this country. he was no sainterior he screwed people. but for every guy he stepped on, he gave a hundred a good job.}
<A>__{edward is silent.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{he seems like a nice man.}
<A>__{david looks at vivian as if seeing her for the first time.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{we can reach an understanding on this.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i don't think so. you should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{do what you have to do. i don't take it personally.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i do. i take it all very personally.}
<P>__{(to vivian)}
<D>__{very nice meeting you, vivian.}
<A>__{david kross gets up and leaves. vivian and edward sit in silence.}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{and that's the way the game is played.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{some game. screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement.}
<A>__{edward says nothing. but vivian can see she's hit a nerve.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{snails for dinner. no wonder everybody is in such a bad mood.}
<A>__{a waiter appears at the table.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{are we ready for the next course, sir?}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{no. bring a check, please.}
