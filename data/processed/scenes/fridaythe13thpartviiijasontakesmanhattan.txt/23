<A>__{a deadly sharp spear gun rests in its rack outside the cabin. jason's hand removes it.}
<L>__{interior houseboat continuous}
<A>__{the sheets begin to roll like waves as they work each other. thoughts of jason are nonexistent now. angle cabin door nothing there for a moment...then a pair of moss covered}
<B>__{bare feet slosh into frame. suzy}
<A>__{closes her eyes with pleasure... angle cabin door ...and camera rises from the mossy feet, up the bloodless legs and torso to ultimately reveal the hockey masked face of our anti hero: jason voorhees.}
<B>__{suzy}
<A>__{lets out a broad smile, her eyelids fluttering. they stay open long enough to regard the visitor in the doorway. she tries to choke out a warning to jim, who's just collapsed himself.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{jjjjjjjjason...}
<A>__{he doesn't follow her glance, smiling instead.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{uh huh. you must really think i'm an ass.}
<A>__{but she continues to stare in horror as:}
<B>__{jason}
<A>__{raises the spear, taking aim. angle suzy and jim hs starts to kiss her but she bolts up with a blood curdling scream. a second later, jason fires the spear, piercing her neck, pinning her to the head board. jim stares point blank at his dead girlfriend, not able to assimilate it quickly enough. he spins around to see the monster himself.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{ohmygod...}
<A>__{jim springs off the bed, looking around for anything to defend himself with, grabbing the bedside lamp. he smashes it over jason's head which has little effect. jim scrambles to get past him, but jason lifts jim in the air, slamming him down on one of the spiked bedposts.}
