<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{this is it? i can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{fuck it. everything must go!}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{oh my god, i remember this hat... this was during your little old lady phase...}
<A>__{a trendy young hipster happens along and looks through the clothes, then to the table where he picks up a ridiculous looking stuffed animal.}
<C>__{hipster}
<D>__{how much is this?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{that's not for sale.}
<C>__{hipster}
<P>__{(noticing price tag)}
<D>__{wait, it says five dollars...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{oh, that's a mistake i decided not to sell it...}
<A>__{the hipster looks around a little more and then leaves.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{what was that all about? i thought everything must go!}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{oh yeah right, like i'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own goofy gus.}
<A>__{a couple is browsing. the girl, a severely skinny, clubhopper type in platform shoes looks at the clothes; the boy, a long haired skateboarder, goes through her records.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{how much is this dress?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{oh my god, you're selling that?}

<C>__{girl}
<D>__{what?}

<D>__{five hundred.}
<C>__{girl}

<C>__{enid}
<D>__{i was wearing that dress the day i lost my virginity.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{well why do i care about that?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{why do you even want it? it would look stupid on you.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{god, fuck you!}
<A>__{enid turns to the boy he's holding some records and a book.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{put that stuff back, it's not for sale.}

<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{now are you going to get a regular job?}
<C>__{enid}
<P>__{(defeated, quiet)}
<D>__{don't worry.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{if it makes you feel any better, i don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.}
