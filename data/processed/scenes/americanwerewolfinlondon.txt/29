<L>__{interior hospital room day}
<A>__{david sits up in bed. lt. villiers and sgt. mcmanus stand by his side. dr. hirsch sits observing.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i'm sorry if i conflict with your report, but jack and i were not attacked by a man.}
<C>__{lt. villiers}
<D>__{so you've said. sgt. mcmanus he may have a point, lieutenant. two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.}
<C>__{lt. villiers}
<D>__{sgt. mcmanus, are you suggesting that david and jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of east proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? we have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. we have two witnesses to the crime. you'll forgive me, mr. kessler, if i consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock. sgt. mcmanus lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and....}
<C>__{lt. villiers}
<D>__{and what, sergeant? sgt. mcmanus}
<P>__{(defeated)}
<D>__{i don't rightly know, sir.}
<C>__{lt. villiers}
<D>__{that is precisely my pointerior david, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. we won't trouble you any further. good day.}
<A>__{the lieutenant goes for the door. the sergeant smiles at david and follows.}
<C>__{lt. villiers}
<D>__{doctor.}
<A>__{the cops exit. dr. hirsch crosses to david's bed.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{there were witnesses?}
<C>__{dr. hirsch}
<D>__{so they said.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{how could there have been witnesses? it was so dark. we were running and i fell and jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere...i don't understand what they're talking about.}
<C>__{dr. hirsch}
<D>__{in time i'm sure it will all come back to you.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{doctor, my memory is fine. it's my sanity i'm beginning to worry about.}
