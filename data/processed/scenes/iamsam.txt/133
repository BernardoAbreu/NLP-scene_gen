<A>__{he doesn't answer it, just methodically folds.}

<P>__{(nothing)}
<D>__{alright. if you don't care enough to open the goddamn door i'm outta here! i've ruined my practice, i've alienated my colleagues i sent my kid off on a fishing trip with his father so i could work with you and you won't open your goddman door for me?! fine! that's it! i've had enough!}
<A>__{she starts down the hall when suddenly she turns and with the mastery of a karate black belt runs and kicks the door down.}
