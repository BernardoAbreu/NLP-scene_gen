<L>__{interior reception night}
<A>__{the band let rip on a funky tune. the congregation fill the dance floor. harvey leads kate back into the room and heads straight for the dance floor. as they pass relatives along the way, harvey introduces them to kate. much hugging and kissing ensues. harvey and kate dance a boogie. uncle fred and aunt maddie join them. uncle fred steals kate from harvey and twirls her off. montage: fun and frolics on the dance floor. harvey is at the center of it all. he initiates a horah. a congo line. russian dancing! kate's face says it all she's having a ball. the sleeping kid, sleeps.}
