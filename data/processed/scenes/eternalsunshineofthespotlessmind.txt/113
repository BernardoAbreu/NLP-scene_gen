<L>__{interior border's bookstore night}
<A>__{joel enters, looks around. there's no sign of clementine. joel approaches a male employee.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{is there a clementine who works here? male employee #1}
<P>__{(calling to another male employee)}
<D>__{mark, is clem on tonight? male employee #2 on my dick, bro.}
<P>__{(turns, sese joel, embarrassed)}
<D>__{oh, hey. yeah, i think she's upstairs in philosophy.}
<A>__{joel climbs stairs, searches the aisle, spots clementine.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{she turns.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{i didn't think you'd show your face around me again. i figured you were humiliated. you did run away, after all.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{sorry to track you down like this. i'm not a stalker. but i needed to see you.}
<C>__{clementine}
<P>__{(seemingly uninterested)}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i'd like to... take you out or something.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{well, you're married.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{not yet. not married.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{look, man, i'm telling you right off the bat, i'm high maintenance. so i'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. if you want to be with me, you're with me.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{so make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.}
<A>__{she goes back to stacking. joel stands there helplessly.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i just think that you have some kind of... quality that seems really important to me.}
<A>__{the scene is disintegrating. clementine's speech is delivered without passion.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{joel, i'm not a concept. i want you to just keep that in your head. too many guys think i'm a concept or i complete them or i'm going to make them alive, but i'm just a fucked up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. don't assign me yours.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i remember that speech really well.}
<C>__{clementine}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i had you pegged, didn't i?}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{you had the whole human race pegged.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{probably.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{i still thought you were going to save me. even after that.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{joel}
<D>__{it would be different, if we could just give it another go around.}
<C>__{clementine}
<D>__{remember me. try your best. maybe we can.}
<A>__{the scene is gone.}
