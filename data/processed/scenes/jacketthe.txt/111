<A>__{starks and jackie walk briskly down it, away from lorenson's office.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i don't believe a thing she just said.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{me neither. who was the boy she was talking about, eugene?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i have no idea.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you think lorenson kills you?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{maybe. i don't know. seems more likely becker does, but at the very least she knows how i died.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{let's see if they have an address for becker. i also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{because that's the part i believe is true. you probably did help her somehow with the boy and eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts i pulled.}
<A>__{starks nods.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{[beat] there's one more thing i want to see.}
