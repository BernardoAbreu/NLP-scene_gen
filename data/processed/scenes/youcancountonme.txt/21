<A>__{sammy is smoking a cigarette and drinking a glass of wine and reading rudy's story. it upsets her.}
<L>__{interior sammy's bedroom. later}
<A>__{sammy sits on the edge of her bed, not dialing the phone. she catches a glimpse of herself in her parents' floor length mirror with the worn, heavy wooden frame. against her better judgment she picks up the phone and dials.}
<L>__{interior dawson's grill. night}
<A>__{sammy and bob steegerson are eating dinner at dawson's, the only fancy restaurant in town. bob is in his mid thirties, a realtor, a decent, ordinary guy.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{anyway, bob, it's sort of this adventure story, and rudy's father is this secret agent or something, working for the government... and it just made me feel weird. you know? because i never really say much to him about rudy sr., because i don't know what to say. and i don't know whether i should just let him imagine whatever he wants to imagine, or whether i should sit him down sometime and tell him, you know, that his father is not such a nice person. you know?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{well... i don't know, sammy. what have you told him already?}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{not much. he knows i don't have the highest opinion of him. and he knows i don't want to see him or know anything about him, ever. but i tried to keep it kind of neutral. anyway... i could go into a lot more detail, believe me.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{well... it's an interesting problem. but i don't really know what to tell you... it's a little outside my personal field of expertise...}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{all right.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i'd be glad to give it some thought...}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{he is smiling at her.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{nothing... i'm just glad to see you... i'm glad you called me.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{i bet you were surprised...!}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{um a little.}
<A>__{bob drains his wineglass. sammy cuts at her steak.}
