<C>__{korfin}
<D>__{they have not soot in their mouths, which means they weren't breathin' before the fire and that usually means they were deceased and this piece of cloth that my partner found means they were wrapped up in something, probably doused with a flammable liquid and positioned like this on the bed. to the untrained eye, it looks like an accident.}
