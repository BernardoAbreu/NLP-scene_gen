<A>__{the glow of a radio dial. lionel and myrtle sit in armchairs, the radio on a side table between them.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{i have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as king as i would wish to do without the help and support of the woman i love.}
<A>__{lionel gets up to turn it off as david's voice concludes:}
<D>__{david (v.o. radio filter) (cont'd) we all have a new king. i wish him and you, his people, happiness and prosperity with all my heart. god bless you all! god save the king!}
<A>__{logue strokes myrtle's hair.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{i too "married the woman i love."}
<C>__{myrtle}
<D>__{you married a shop girl.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{a wonderful lass. someone i can talk to heart to heart.}
<C>__{myrtle}
<D>__{using simple words and short sentences. i'm very ordinary.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{that's why we're suited. i'm just an ordinary bloke.}
<C>__{myrtle}
<D>__{ordinary? you're a man with wild dreams, lionel. mine are so very small. a job, a husband, a home. raising our sons. that's all i ever wanted.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{me too.}
<C>__{myrtle}
<D>__{is that why, every day, you've spent hours with a man who's about to be king?}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{that relationship is now past tense.}
<C>__{myrtle}

<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{i wanted to be a great actor. that's what i wanted.}
<C>__{myrtle}
<D>__{and failing that...}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{i certainly failed!}
<C>__{myrtle}
<D>__{a great healer. always...'great'. where does a shop girl fit in?}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{very snugly, into my heart! always have, always will.}
<C>__{myrtle}
<D>__{trouble is, lionel, when you say that, i still believe it.}
