<A>__{mrs jennings pants up the front steps.}
<L>__{interior mrs jennings's house bedroom day}
<A>__{elinor and marianne are packing. their mood is gloomy and uncommunicative. mrs jennings explodes into the room fighting for breath.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{oh, my dears! what a commotion! mr edward ferrars the very one i used to joke you about, miss dashwood has been engaged these five years to lucy steele!}
<A>__{marianne lets out a gasp. she looks at elinor, who nods at her in swift confirmation.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{poor mr ferrars! his mother, who by all accounts is very proud, demanded that he break the engagement on pain of disinheritance. but he has refused to break his promise to lucy. he has stood by her, good man, and is cut off without a penny! she has settled it all irrevocably upon mr robert. but i cannot stop, i must go to lucy. your sister in law scolded her like any fury drove her to hysterics.}
<A>__{she leaves the room, still rabbiting on. there is a silence.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{how long have you known?}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{since the evening mrs jennings offered to take us to london.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{why did you not tell me?}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{lucy told me in the strictest confidence.}
<A>__{marianne looks at her in complete incredulity.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{i could not break my word.}
<A>__{clearly, there is no arguing this pointerior}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{but edward loves you.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{he made me no promises. he tried to tell me about lucy.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{he cannot marry her.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{would you have him treat her even worse than willoughby has treated you?}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{no but nor would i have him marry where he does not love.}
<A>__{elinor tries hard to be controlled.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{edward made his promise a long time ago, long before he met me. though he may... harbour some regret, i believe he will be happy in the knowledge that he did his duty and kept his word. after all after all that is bewitching in the idea of one's happiness depending entirely on one person, it is not always possible. we must accept. edward will marry lucy and you and i will go home.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{always resignation and acceptance! always prudence and honour and duty! elinor, where is your heart?}
<A>__{elinor finally explodes. she turns upon marianne almost savagely.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{what do you know of my heart? what do you know of anything but your own suffering? for weeks, marianne, i have had this pressing on me without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature. it was forced upon me by the very person whose prior claims ruined all my hopes. i have had to endure her exultation again and again while knowing myself to be divided from edward forever. believe me, marianne, had i not been bound to silence i could have produced proof enough of a broken heart even for you.}
<A>__{complete silence. then marianne speaks in a whisper.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{oh, elinor!}
<A>__{marianne bursts into sobs and flings her arms around elinor, who, almost impatiently, tries to comfort her.}
