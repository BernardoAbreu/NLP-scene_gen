<D>__{evan, if you're watching this shame on you. i hope you never treat another girl the way you treated me or you will die alone, wishing it was because you're fat. and since we're playing the shame game... while i appreciate the sentiment, lewis, a pretend hand job should have warranted a little more than a hundred dollars worth of amc movie passes. they had an expiration date and were only able to be used for movies that had been running for two weeks. but even that's better than tyler jennings, who gave me a ten percent off coupon to bath and body works. seriously. a fucking coupon. is that how good my imaginary blow job was to you? huh? is chivalry dead? i want john cusack holding a boombox outside my window. i want richard gere climbing up my fire escape with the limo waiting downstairs. i want to ride off on a lawnmower with patrick dempsey. although, i'm ashamed to admit i'd prefer him to look like he looks now. what woman wouldn't? but no. i get to save two fifty on a bottle of juniper breeze hand lotion. maybe chivalry isn't dead, but it's in a coma and the prognosis isn't good.}

<D>__{so, if you're still with me and i'm guessing that most of you are i now present to you part four: how i, olive penderghast, went from assumed trollop to an actual home wrecker.}
