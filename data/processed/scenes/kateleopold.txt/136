<C>__{dr. drake}
<D>__{it's time leopold.}
<A>__{leopold holds kate's face in his hands. very slowly they part. leopold takes his place in the machine and straps himself in. he places one hand on the red lever and the other against the glass pane on the door. kate comes over and places her hand over his. wordlessly, they say goodbye. after a moment, dr. kau gently moves kate away. dr. plodder silently raises his arm, signaling leopold.}
<C>__{dr. plodder}
<D>__{9 8 7 6 5 4...}
<A>__{leopold shifts in his seat, his eyes never leaving kate's, his hand still against the glass. kate smiles tenderly at leopold.}
<C>__{dr. plodder}
<D>__{3 2 1!}
<A>__{dr. plodder drops his arm signaling leopold. leopold pulls the lever, still gazing at kate. there is a blinding flash of light, then darkness.}
