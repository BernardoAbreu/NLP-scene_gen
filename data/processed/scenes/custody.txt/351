<D>__{ten.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{melanie, there is a grace about you that reminds me how clumsy i am. there is an honesty about you that reminds me how deceitful i can be. there is a beauty in your eyes that reminds me how ugly i've become. there is a kindness in your voice that contradicts my coarseness. there is a glow around you that illuminates my dullness. there is spirit in you that challenges my laziness, but most of all, there is a woman in you, that sparks my desire, a desire to be graceful and honest and beautiful and kind. a desire to be better than i am or ever thought i could be.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{go on.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{i think my ten seconds are up.}

<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{that's not what you said.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{i said i love you.}
