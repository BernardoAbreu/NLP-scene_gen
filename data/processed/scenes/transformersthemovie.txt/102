<C>__{unicron's stomach}
<D>__{this is the central processing area for unicron's "food" and "energy." a long conveyer belt drops junk into a clear, bubbling vat, where it is separated into raw material and energy. the energy, which comes out in raw form, goes into a machine and is crunched into energon cubes, while the solid material, is separated into it's component metals and plastics, formed into ingots and sent elsewhere in an assembly line fashion.}

<A>__{... several decepticon troopers hanging from cables like shirts at a dry cleaners are dropped into the bubbling vat, and in moments converted to nothing... ... then, cliffjumper and jazz roll out of the line...}

<A>__{then, he sees.}
<C>__{a control}

<B>__{angle on daniel}
<A>__{he reaches the flickering panel.}
<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{what do i do? it doesn't have any buttons or anything.}
<A>__{angle on spike tracking he looks down.}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{shoot it, son.}
<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{but i don't have a gun.}
<C>__{spike}
<D>__{use your exo suit.}
<B>__{angle on daniel}
<A>__{he looks down at his hand and concentrates as hard as he can. then, a spark comes out. it grows longer.}

<D>__{hurry!}
<C>__{daniel}

<A>__{it keeps moving. then, cliffjumper is dropped in!}
<B>__{angle on daniel}
<A>__{he looks back, and to his horror sees jazz, bumblebee and his father about to be dropped in. he keeps firing. the panel starts exploding!}
<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{i can't stop it!}
<B>__{angle on the assembly line}
<A>__{jazz drops in, then bumblebee, then spike.}
