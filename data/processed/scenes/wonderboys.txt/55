<L>__{interior aisle market morning (later)}
<A>__{grady and james stand in the sundries aisle of a neighborhood market. grady has a tin of band aids open and is presently plastering his ragged thumb.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{where exactly do you live, james?}
<A>__{james, in the midst of chugging from a 64 ounce jug of orange juice, stops.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{apparently not even hannah green has a clue as to the location of your apartment.}
<A>__{grady tosses the tin of band aids into a small plastic hand basket, begins to move down the aisle.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{i got kicked out. well, not exactly kicked out. i was asked to leave.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i guess there's probably a story behind that.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{there is, but it's not that interesting.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{so where have you been staying?}
<C>__{james leer}
<P>__{(a long pause)}
<D>__{the bus station.}
<A>__{grady stares incredulously at james.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{it's not so bad. i know the night janitor. and there's a broken locker i can put my stuff.}
<C>__{grady}
<P>__{(trying to fathom this)}
<D>__{but james. i mean. ..how long?}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{a couple weeks. that's why... that's why i had the gun. for protection.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{jesus, james, you should've told someone.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i don't know...}
<P>__{(unconvincingly)}
<D>__{me.}
<A>__{grady drops the basket at the check out counter and, abruptly, finds himself face to face with a baby, lolling on the shoulder of the woman before him. the baby is staring, spellbound, at a display of...q's latest}
<B>__{paperback. grady}
<A>__{frowns, then detects the true source of enchantment: a spray of shiny mylar gift balloons. a thought evolves.}
<C>__{grady }
<P>__{(the balloons)}
<D>__{what do you think of these?}
<A>__{james takes another chug from his jug, nods.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{nice.}
