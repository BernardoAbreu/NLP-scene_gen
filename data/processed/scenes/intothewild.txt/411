<A>__{chris' pov: through the trees and fireweed, he sees something metallic and rusty. chris moves up through the underbrush and the snow into the narrow tree line and on into the clearing, where before him: a derelict school bus. it is a vintage international harvester from the 1940's. chris approaches the bus, lifts the hood a little bit seeing that the engine is gone. as he moves around the vehicle, we see several windows are cracked or missing altogether. the green and white paint is badly oxidized. weathered lettering: fairbanks city transit system bus}
