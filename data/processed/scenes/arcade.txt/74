<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior level one, the plains day}
<A>__{alex and nick slam into the ground like twin meteors, splashing up water and muck.}
<B>__{the red sky}
<A>__{crackles with lightning. smoke obscures everything. alex and nick pull themselves up, a bit dazed.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{you feel it? it's different this time.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{we're actually inside, aren't we?}
<A>__{alex nods.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{okay.}
<P>__{(deep breath)}
<D>__{give us a kiss?}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(after a moment)}
<D>__{one. in case...}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{don't even say it.}
<A>__{nick leans over and gently kisses alex on the lips. it's over in a moment, but he'll savor it the rest of his life.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{thanks. always wanted to do that.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{yeah, well i figure these are unusual circumstances.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{that's what i was hoping you'd say.}
<A>__{nick flips the visor on his helmet down and checks the digital read out on his cyberglove. when he speaks, his voice is filtered through a radio headset. nick looks good in his armor, tough. hell, they both do.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i will take the lead and handle the physical threats. you watch the elapsed time and look for exits.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{got it.}
<A>__{nick tosses his thrasher board down and it hovers above the water. he steps onto it, comfortable. alex does the same. she's a little shaky, but she maintains her balance.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you steer by pivoting your back foot...}
<P>__{(he demonstrates)}
<D>__{okay?}
<A>__{nick turns, looking around. the land seems identical in every direction.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{which way do you think level two is?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you've got the schematics, check.}
<A>__{nick panics for a moment, patting his uniform, checking pockets. he can't find them.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{oh shit! what if they didn't come with us?!}
<A>__{he stops. reaches into a pocket, and pulls out the schematics. breathes a sigh of relief.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(looking at them)}
<D>__{okay. it's west.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{the keys are supposed to be at the end of each level. once we get all the keys, we can unlock arcade's heart. and then...}
<A>__{she looks at nick, uncertain.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{...and then we go to the final level.}
<P>__{(off her look)}
<D>__{hey, don't worry about it. it's a game. how bad could it be?}
<A>__{alex glances at her wrist display. the "elapsed time" bar is made up of ten blocks of light stacked upon each other. the top block has disappeared. one tenth of their time is gone.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{the clock's already ticking.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{right, then...}
<A>__{nick leans forward and the board starts to float. alex does the same, and in seconds, they're gliding over the plains. from above, as we see their forms disappear in the smoke.}
