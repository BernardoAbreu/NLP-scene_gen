<A>__{amanda is wheeling mark in his gurney around the store, stopping from time to time to take something down from the shelf. she picks out a shirt.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{this you must have.}
<A>__{as she leans over to show it to him, mark doesn't seem to be listening. he whispers to her.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i love you.}
<A>__{she says nothing and gives the faintest of smiles, then puts the shirt back. they continue round the store in thoughtful silence and avoid eye contact with each other. we sense from the looks on their faces that this moment spells the end of a beautiful friendship.}
