<L>__{interior bus day}
<A>__{trevor sits at the front of the bus agitated. he folds and unfolds detective lange's business card in his hands like some frustrated origami artist. the siren from a passing ambulance drills his ears. the irritating sound eventually fades away but the pain in his head is still there. the bonging of a distant cathedral's bell makes him pause. he looks around. toward the rear and sees a familiar old lady knitting a baby's bootie. he looks again. the bootie is bright red and dripping... blood? trevor follows the strand of bright red wool down to their source: a dying goat laying under the seat. it's insides have been ripped out. its veins and tendons are serving as the old lady's yarn. trevor's eyes bolt back up to the old woman. she continues humming sweetly, her lap speckled with goat's blood. trevor pulls the wire and an obnoxious buzzing goes off. trevor hurries up to the bus driver as the bus pulls over.}

<D>__{just open the doors i will jump off.}
<C>__{bus driver}
<D>__{not while the bus is moving, sir.}
<A>__{trevor clutches his head in pain and waits for the bus to stop. the doors open. he jumps off, knees nearly buckling from the pain. he looks up as the bus speeds off. in the rear window the little black girl seen earlier pops up. she's holding her little doll. she pushes a clothespin into its head. blood drips from the puncture. at the same time trevor feels an incredible pain sear through his head. he squints at the bus again. the little girl is gone.}
