<A>__{winter setting in. inman, increasingly a stick figure in the landscape, wasted and fragile, trudges along through fallen leaves. he still limps from the leg irons. no shelter anywhere. he unwraps a paper containing some scraps of goat meat and corn bread. he walks and eats, fishes out a lozenge, tries to swallow it, washes it down with a drink from his flask. opens the crock of salve and rubs the treacly grease into his neck and ankle. the path splits. he doesn't know which way to go, a crow repeatedly caws off to the left and, taking it as a sign, inman goes in that direction.}
