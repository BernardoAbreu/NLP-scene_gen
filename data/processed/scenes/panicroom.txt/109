<A>__{junior and raoul are huddled together in the foyer. they're keeping their voices low, but their conversation is heated.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{we're not gonna do anything about him, he's fine.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{if you think i'm gonna let my half of the fourteen million bucks slip away because of }

<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{i'm just saying, the man is a problem. and he's your problem. wasn't me idea to bring him along.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{that's right, raoul, it wasn't your idea, none of this was your idea, it was mine, it's my family we're ripping off, it's my prick grandfather who built that fucking room, it was my idea to get the plans, i found the floor safe, and it was my idea to ask a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one! me, me, me, i, i, i, at no point did i say "you" or raoul," got it?}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{he puts his hands on me again i will bury a slug in his ear.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{no, you will not, because without burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as i'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me?}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{don't take no tone of voice with me, homes.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{what is this shit you're talking all of a sudden? you're a bus driver, "homes," you live in flatbush, so please don't start spouting some elmore leonard shit you just heard because i saw that movie too,}
<A>__{on the video monitors, junior and raoul are visible, still arguing in the foyer. on the next monitor over, burnham is visible, standing in the master bedroom doorway, listening. in the panic room, meg is watching the monitors, thinking. she notices something, sits forward abruptly, looking at the monitor that covers the master bedroom. she squeezes right up close, staring at the screen. on the monitor, we peer closely at the box next to her bed, the one she was using for a night table. on top of the box, she sees the charger for her cellular phone, sitting empty. in the panic room, meg sits back, eyes alive with an idea. if only she could get to that phone, which must be still under the bed. she looks back at the monitors, at burnham lingering in the doorway to the room.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{damn.}
<A>__{she turns away from the monitors, to check on sarah, who's settled into a corner of the room, looking pale.}
