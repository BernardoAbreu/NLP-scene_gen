<D>__{stauffenberg? on his way back to berlin, i should think.}
<A>__{at the very mention of his name, olbricht starts squirming.}
<C>__{keitel }
<D>__{let me know when he arrives. i'd like a word with him.}
<C>__{fromm}
<D>__{certainly.}
<A>__{click. after a beat, fromm hangs up, smug.}
<C>__{fromm }
<D>__{a false alarm. the fuhrer is fine.}
<A>__{herber's outward relief stands in sharp contrast to olbricht's barely contained dread. then:}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{that's a lie.}
<A>__{all eyes turn to see stauffenberg and haeften appear in the doorway. mertz lets out a sigh of relief as they push their way past herber and march into the room.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{hitler is dead. operation valkyrie is in effect.}
<A>__{fromm stands, pounding his fist on the desk.}
<C>__{fromm}

<D>__{this is nothing less than treason.}

<C>__{fromm}
<D>__{this can't be happening. it's some kind of joke.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{are you with us or not?}
<C>__{fromm}
<D>__{colonel, if what you say is true you should shoot yourself at once.}

<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{no, general. you are.}
<A>__{and with those words, haeften and mertz draw their pistols, training them on the confused fromm. herber is paralyzed unsure of what to do.}
