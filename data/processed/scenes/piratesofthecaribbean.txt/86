<A>__{jack stands before barbossa, surrounded by pirates. jack has a wide smile on his face and barbossa doesn't like it.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{i'm inclined to kill you now, jack sparrow, without so much as a word, if you don't lose that grin from your face.}
<A>__{jack's smile remains. barbossa puts a hand to his cutlass }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{the woman's blood didn't work, did it?}
<A>__{barbossa hesitates.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{i know who's blood you need, to end the curse.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{say the name, or i slit your throat.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no you won't.}
<A>__{barbossa nods. pintel steps forward, puts a blade to jack's throat. jack's smile widens.}
<C>__{pintel}
<D>__{now?}
<C>__{barbossa }
<D>__{now.}
<P>__{(pintel grins)}
<D>__{no, don't kill him.}
<A>__{surprised, pintel lowers his cutlass. jack's expression hasn't changed.}
<C>__{barbossa }
<D>__{allow me the humor of listening to your terms.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{simple. i have something you want more than anything. the way to free you from the curse of the treasure. you have something i want more than anything.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{the pearl?}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{oh, that's fine. and just how do you expect this to work?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you give me the pearl. then i tell you who you need.}
<A>__{barbossa stares at him, incredulous.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{that's your offer? you, sailing away nice and pretty with the black pearl, and all i have is a name?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{i'm supposed to ... trust you?}
<A>__{the pirates laugh.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm a man of my word.}
<A>__{the pirates laugh louder.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{you see, i've got this honest streak in me in its own way, a sort of curse. oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{i will torture it out of you.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you left me on a desert island what worse can you do?}
<A>__{jack is still smiling, intentionally smug now. barbossa sees his options dwindling, begins to pace.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{blast you! i will throw you in prison.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{wait as long as you like.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{you're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{let's say i tell you the wrong person. what would you do?}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{track you down and }
<A>__{he sees where jack is headed.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{and if i tell you the truth, you become mortal, and you won't come near me because you know i'd kill you.}
<A>__{barbossa hesitates. the pirates are amazed at how the tide has turned; barbossa has gone past considering the idea, and might even do it.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{jack, i don't trust you, and that's a fact. never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{see, that's where we're different. i trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{you're playing this as close to the edge as any man, i will give you that.}
<P>__{(decides, smiles)}
<D>__{we might just have to sign articles, you and i. jack, you're a pirate at heart, that's certain.}
<A>__{jack nods.}
<C>__{barbossa }
<D>__{pintel ... set sail. if this fool plan is to work, we'll need the medallion, and that means catching the ship which brought 'em here.}
<A>__{jack is caught completely off guard. for the first time, his smile fades.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what you don't have the medallion?}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{that fool woman took it. you be careful around her, jack she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart but pure evil inside.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i will watch my back.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{bosun! set up mr. sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ... in the brig.}
<P>__{(to jack, a smile)}
<D>__{meaning no disrespect, of course.}
<A>__{jack nods, and is taken away. barbossa stares after him, not hiding his mistrust.}
