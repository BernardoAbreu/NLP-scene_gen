<L>__{interior ted's car}
<A>__{tiffany finally looks over at ted, who's just getting to his feet. she bursts out of the car...}
<L>__{exterior parking area by paul's car}
<A>__{raymond reaches paul, takes the gun and points it at the top of his head. paul's eyes shut tight, expecting the worst.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{raymond... please.}
<A>__{but shooting your brother is tougher than it looks. paul opens his eyes. raymond tries to pull the trigger again, but can't. he moves the barrel six inches to the right and shoots margaret in the back. she drops face first into the snow. paul's world ends. ears ringing, he rushes toward his wife. jimbo can't believe it as gary holds him back.}
<C>__{jimbo}
<D>__{hey! what the fuck!!}
<A>__{raymond, a look of relief on his face, turns to jimbo.}
<C>__{jimbo }
<D>__{she had nothing to do with this!}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{and you do?}
<A>__{but even before raymond can raise his weapon, gary pulls his gun and gets it pointed (shakily) at raymond.}
<C>__{raymond }
<D>__{oh put it down, nancy.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{you first.}
<C>__{jimbo}
<D>__{gary! just }
<A>__{raymond drops his gun to his side. gary smiles, too happy he won the face off.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{you win, tough guy.}
<A>__{gary, trying to be cool, flips the gun to his other hand. as he does bang! the bullet rips into the snow about six feet from raymond's feet. raymond glares at gary. so does jimbo.}
<C>__{gary}
<P>__{(meek, apologetic)}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{jimbo lunges for cover as raymond fires back. gary, truly terrified, closes his eyes as he squeezes off shots on the run bangbangbangbang. one bullet bounces off paul's car. one hits raymond. with a quizzical look on his face, he drops to his knees. a large crimson stain forms on his jacket. everything goes quiet, except for the sounds coming from... paul, almost crazed with grief, cradles his wife's body.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{oh god... oh jesus...}
<C>__{margaret}
<P>__{(muffled)}
<D>__{oh fucking hell... i can't... breath.}
<A>__{paul gently turns her over. margaret, alive, unharmed but winded, tries to catch her breath.}
<C>__{margaret }
<D>__{paul... someone kicked me.}
<A>__{paul feels around the bullet hole and pulls out a stack of money, now embedded with the slug from the raymond's gun. he starts to weep tears of relief.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{can you stand.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{is... the pope... a...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{okay, easy...}
<A>__{gary is behind the other car with jimbo.}
<C>__{gary}
<P>__{(starting to lose it)}
<D>__{he just, fell... oh jesus, oh god.}
<A>__{jimbo gently takes gary's gun.}
<C>__{jimbo}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{as jimbo puts an arm around gary and helps him to the car, he sees paul, arm around margaret, coming their way. everyone stops. a look passes, then both couples move off.}
