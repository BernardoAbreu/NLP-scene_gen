<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior corridor beneath game grid}
<A>__{two guards leading flynn down it, echoing footsteps. they turn a corner and continue, finally stopping in front of a cell. the door opens automatically. flynn holds back.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{video game unit #18. in here, program.}
<C>__{flynn}
<P>__{(trying to grab the guard's arm)}
<D>__{who you callin' "program," program?}
<A>__{the guard shoves flynn inside and slams the door, cutting off his voice.}
<L>__{interior cell}
<A>__{the same type of cell crom was thrown into in the title sequence. flynn is leaning against the door, staring at his hands.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{flynn's hands are glowing, electrified.}
<B>__{close shot}
<A>__{of his face. his head comes up and we see an expression of terrible understanding on his face. voices are coming through the opening of the neighboring cell.}
<L>__{interior next cell ram's}
<A>__{ram is standing at the window that divides his cell from tron's.}
<C>__{ram}
<P>__{(looking over his shoulder)}
<D>__{new guy...}
<C>__{tron}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{another free program off line. what's his user s'posed to do ?}
<C>__{ram}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{the users...you really think they're still there?}
<C>__{tron}
<D>__{they'd better be...i don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.}
<A>__{flynn's cell he can hear the voices, but can't see anything except ram's back, so he goes to the window and tries to reach through.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{hey! who are you guys? what's the story around here?}
<A>__{but as his hand reaches the dividing point between the two cells, it hits an invisible barrier, and we see a brilliant energy field come instantaneously into existence, stopping his hand, and then disappearing. flynn pulls back in shock.}
<B>__{ram}
<A>__{turning towards flynn as he hears this noise.}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{you want to watch those force fields...}
<A>__{he goes to the window opening.}
<C>__{ram }
<D>__{you'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{look...just so i can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? where am i?}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{you're a..."guest" of the master control program. they're going to make you play video games.}
<C>__{flynn}
<P>__{(relieved)}
<D>__{well, great, that's no sweat i play video games better than anybody.}
<A>__{ram gives flynn an astonished look, but before he can say anything, there's a tremendous pounding noise, and the door of flynn's cell opens.}
<B>__{the corridor}
<A>__{we see guards pulling out other captives from their cells, and as flynn is led off down the corridor, tron and ram are taken in the opposite direction.}
