<L>__{exterior observatory hideout establishing shot}
<A>__{grime and moss decorate the outside of this long abandoned building overlooking the coast. once a place of knowledge and wonder now home to a great evil.}
<L>__{interior observatory hideout day}
<A>__{the inside is in complete contrast to the exterior. the huge hall with a giant telescope teems with advanced electronic equipment. computers, monitors and machines which do not have an obvious function flash and hum. a steel door slides open, revealing the subject of our story master mind a villainous sight to behold. his face is inexplicably light blue, topped by an oversized, mushroom shaped head with a circular patch of white hair on top. he's dressed in the kind of costume only a super villain could pull off: a purple jumpsuit and black boot ensemble with a giant green "m" on the chest. his right hand, hanging at his side, is a metal gauntlet with three short spikes}
<B>__{protruding between his knuckles.}
<A>__{master mind begins to survey the room with his two}
<B>__{permanently arched eyebrows.}
<A>__{a man dressed as albert einstein is busy ranting to two other men. one, a hulking brute, is dressed as leonardo da vinci. the other, a small intellectual type carrying a clip board, is dressed as the philosopher plato.}
<C>__{einstein}
<D>__{i hate the outfits. i mean, i get it: we're all supposed to be "masterminds" very clever.}
<C>__{einstein}
<D>__{i just feel stupid. i mean, what the hell did einstein really do anyway?}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{theory of relativity.}
<A>__{einstein starts feverishly scratching his side.}
<C>__{einstein}
<D>__{well, you'd think he'd invent a wool sweater that didn't itch so much.}
<A>__{da vinci and plato's eyes suddenly grow with concern as they see master mind walk up behind einstein. einstein notices his colleague's staring over his right shoulder and turns around. he turns around and master mind seizes him by his throat with his metal gauntlet.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{the real einstein once said, "god does not play dice with the world." he was right, because the world is my dice. is that understood? da vinci & plato sir! yes, sir!}
<C>__{einstein}
<P>__{(gasping for air)}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{master mind undoes his grip on einstein's throat.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{alright, then clean slate. do we have the girl?}
<C>__{da vinci}
<D>__{yes, sir. she fell into our trap just like you knew she would.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{reporters are a curious lot, and easily manipulated.}
<A>__{he quickly checks his physique in a giant mirror, adjusts his posture and sucks in his gut.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{alright, let's not keep the lady waiting.}
<B>__{moments later}
<A>__{da vinci escorts a blindfolded and bound woman, roxanne ritchi, to the back of the room where plato and einstein are standing guard over a large black swivel chair facing away from us. she pulls free of da vinci's grasp and waits for him to undo the blindfold. her face uncovered, we finally see roxanne's striking features all of which seem overshadowed by piercing eyes that seem more put off by the situation than afraid of it.}
<C>__{master mind }
<D>__{miss ritchi, we meet again.}
<A>__{the chair turns menacingly slow, finally revealing master mind.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{you didn't need to turn around like that. i can recognize the stench of failure.}
<A>__{master mind unleashes a wicked laugh.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{i trust you gentlemen know the very sassy roxanne ritchi, highly regarded investigative journalist who some say has a more than friendly relationship with our super powered foe uberman. and miss ritchi, i trust you've already met my new crew: the mad geniuses!}
<A>__{roxanne gives einstein a once over.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{looks like a real group of winners. at the risk of sounding cliche', you'll never get away with this.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{in a way, i already have.}
<A>__{roxanne unleashes an exhausted sigh.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{we go through this every time. you kidnap me to get to uberman, he immediately finds your hideout, escapes whatever lame trap you've come up with, and takes you and your cronies to jail. i propose we just save everybody some heartache this time by you letting me go, and me forgetting this whole thing ever happened?}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{what about my revenge?}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{we can say it was wasting everyone's time.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{you have a wicked tongue. i hope you rid yourself of that when you're my queen.}
<A>__{roxanne unleashes a snort filled laugh.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{i'm sorry. what makes you think i would want to be your queen?}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{power corrupts absolutely, miss ritchi. and when i have ultimate power over this city, i have absolutely every intention of corrupting you with it.}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{sir!}
<A>__{master mind turns to plato who's now standing at a computer terminal.}
<C>__{master mind}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{what is it!?}
