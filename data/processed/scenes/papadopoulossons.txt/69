<A>__{montage to the same music. mrs parrington picks up a tray with teas and we follow her through the shop. she stops so that people can take a mug and we see her continue her journey all the way through the shop to outside, where we see harry sitting alone in the van. he's not part of the activity. we see scrubbing, cleaning, fixing. boards are taken down. inside we see people painting and the fish fryer cleaned. we see product displays go up. we see spiros with manic and crazy enthusiasm. james and katie messing around. finally, we see father jimmy splashing holy water, saying a prayer and making the sign of the cross over the fish frying range while others stand and watch the ceremony with respect. he splashes water on those assembled. they wince as the holy water hits them. the music fades.}
