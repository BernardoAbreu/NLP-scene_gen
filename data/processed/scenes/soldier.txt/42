<L>__{interior "station" day}
<A>__{a new soldier fills the frame, a perfect looking man boy of about twenty built like a linebacker, powerful looking with sculpted unscarred musculature. he looks straight ahead, unblinking, and so does the one next to him, and the next one. twenty of them are standing in line in one corner of an enormous space that was once a station of some sort. they don't seem to respond to the chill or to the occasional drops of rain from the skylights leaking sixty feet above them. wearing dripping ponchos, church, sloan, and rubrick are looking the robot like monsters over like so much meat, while a bright eyed blond colonel about thirty, named mekum, stands proudly by, glowing with satisfaction. the vast interior is so large that in spite of clusters of stacked crates, part of a dismantled spaceship, a rusty earthmover, numerous large pieces of machinery, and a whole arrangement of exercise gear, the place has huge open spaces and a sense of emptiness to it. sloan walks close to the line of new soldiers and studies one, her eyes drifting over their muscular bodies. she breaks the long silence.}
<C>__{sloan}
<D>__{well, they're...pretty.}
<C>__{church}
<P>__{(to mekum)}
<D>__{what's so hot about them?}
<C>__{mekum}
<P>__{(proudly)}
<D>__{very much improved. in every way.}
<C>__{rubrick}
<D>__{this is colonel mekum from q. he's their commanding officer.}
<C>__{church}
<P>__{(dubious)}
<D>__{improved...how?}
<C>__{mekum}
<D>__{as i said, in every way. physically and psychologically. more endurance, quicker responses, better hand eye, improved technical training. where the first psychology gave you ninety eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.}

<P>__{(dubiously)}
<D>__{mmmmmm. weeell, you know my old daddy was in maintenance and he had a saying...}
<A>__{rubrick and sloan exchange an eye rolling private glance that means they've heard a lot of daddy's sayings.}
<C>__{church}
<D>__{...he used to say, "if it ain't broke, don't fix it."}
<C>__{mekum}
<P>__{(patronizing)}
<D>__{i...see. i'm not sure i quite get your...pointerior..}
<C>__{church}
<P>__{(indicating the veterans)}
<D>__{well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done. now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen? they are battle tested, aren't they?}
<C>__{mekum}
<D>__{that's up to you field guys. h.q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in january.}
<C>__{church}
<D>__{the sweep is just routine, not even police action. i'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...}
<C>__{mekum}
<D>__{such as?}
<C>__{church}
<D>__{maybe we could run some tests. kind of a comparison, the old and the new...}
<A>__{rubrick and sloan exchange a startled glance, but mekum doesn't seem fazed as we...}
