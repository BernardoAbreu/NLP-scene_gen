<L>__{exterior street flying feet day}
<A>__{max in the rickshaw, hasari running alongside ram, an exuberant smile slashed across his face.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{you see, i can keep up.}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{keep up, of course. anyone can run at this pace. but you think it's easy to run and to pull?}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{i can do it. i could pull it.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{come on, give him a shot. he's as fast as you and looks twice as strong.}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{will you still pay me when he runs you into a ditch?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{absolutely. i trust the man.}
<A>__{suddenly, ram comes to a stop.}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{all right, you, come, step in here.}
<A>__{hasari looks on max with enormous gratitude. ram puts the shafts down, has a short coughing fit, spits some phlegm, looks at max.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i hope you're taking something for that.}
<A>__{ram waves him off as hasari lifts the shafts to his hips.}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{now, fine, pull, go.}
<A>__{hasari tries to pull, but the center of gravity isn't easy to find. this is enormously difficult and hasari's very clumsy at it. the street is crowded. the traffic is beginning to back up behind them. the driver and conductor of the tram let fly a tirade of insults.}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{see, mister! what did i tell you? come on! what do you think this is some village street? you've got to move quickly.}
<A>__{he turns to max.}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{you see, it takes a gift.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i say he can do it. i will bet you the fare he can do it.}
<P>__{(play by play)}
<D>__{what do you think, rickshaw fans, can he do it?}
<A>__{the crowd isn't in for fun. hasari strains forward. the rickshaw moves with him. ram moves alongside, shouting instructions and oaths. a cop comes on the run, screaming at hasai... which makes ram importune more strongly and max joke more vociferously. even under this incredible pressue, hasari gains confidence and begins to move quicker, earning shouts of approval from max and ram, who now has trouble keeping up as they make their way through the maelstrom, an avalanche of oaths following them.}
