<B>__{sloping street}
<A>__{escaping back into the old quarter, kafka runs downhill. but even the momentum doesn't carry him as fast as he'd like.}
<B>__{small square}
<A>__{a number of streets branching off. kafka sees mr. pick coming down one of them and the laborer coming down another. kafka runs off along a third.}
<B>__{circuitous passage}
<A>__{kafka runs. looks behind him. mr. pick is coming. he runs faster, under a weird archway. looks behind him. mr. pick and the laborer are coming. kafka darts down a side street.}
<B>__{side street}
<A>__{another twisting little road. he winds around one corner only to be met by another, the end of this street impossible to determine.}
<B>__{behind him}
<A>__{mr. pick and the laborer are catching up.}
<B>__{kafka}
<A>__{turns another corner and finds himself at the bottom of an incredibly long flight of steps. a staired street. on and on and on. he doesn't know if he can make it.}
<B>__{mr. pick and the laborer}
<A>__{come around look at the steps look at each other. they take deep breaths and start up.}
<B>__{the top}
<A>__{here they come, huffing and puffing.}
<B>__{the bottom}
<A>__{kafka comes out from behind an extravagantly designed iron gate grillwork. he sneaks away, back the way he came.}
