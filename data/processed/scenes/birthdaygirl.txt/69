<L>__{interior branch manager's office day}
<A>__{john back in the room. the report has finished and the manager is scrutinising him in silence.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{thank you i think that's very fair.}
<L>__{interior exterior john's car (moving) day}
<A>__{john drives his rover through the centre of town, the low orange sun on his face.}
<L>__{exterior john's close day}
<A>__{the rover pulls into the driveway. john opens the glove compartment and removes the ring nadia gave him, and puts it back on. he collects a brown paper package from the passenger seat.}
<L>__{interior john's kitchen night}
<A>__{john and nadia at the supper table. she is knitting the jumper. despite the silence, john seems more relaxed, in shirtsleeves and loosened tie. he puts his fork down, and places the brown bag on the table, pushing it across to nadia. she opens it and removes a big hardback russian english dictionary. john smiles and nods "open it". she flicks through it. she turns it over in her hands, nods, puts the book down, reaches under the table and surfaces with the stack of porn magazines. she puts them on the table next to the dictionary. john beholds the pile. "wet n' wild" is on top. he rises slowly from the table and sleepwalks from the kitchen.}
