<D>__{i'm over it now, but it was a very trying time... very trying... i've only just started eating again.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{you know what would be a lot more healthy and satisfying is to get yourself a chicken... just pop it in the oven for a couple of hours with a little bit of seasoning on it. makes a good meal, and you can make sandwiches with the leftovers.}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{but then you have to sit and watch it cook. something seems sad about a man sitting alone in a house and watching a chicken cook.}
