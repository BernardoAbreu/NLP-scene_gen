<L>__{140 rue des abderames. outside. morning.}
<A>__{the sun has risen to the height of the terraces. the terraces are swarming with people. the alley is empty and only the fuse is visible; it reaches to a small clearing full of paratroopers. two more colonels and a general have arrived. there is a paratrooper with an "arriflex" ready to film the explosion. the atmosphere is that of a show. two paratroopers are connecting the ends of the fuse to the electric contact. on the terraces, there are algerian women, children, and old people. their eyes are motionless; someone is praying. there is an atmosphere of suspense. there is also the wife of mahmoud; her eyes seem blank. five paras come out of the house quickly, and pass along the alley toward the clearing. the captain signals, and the para begins to lower the contact switch slowly. the eyes of all are motionless. the camera is ready. but the explosion does not occur. the paratrooper swears; he examines the wires.}

<D>__{stand back! ready, pierre?}
<A>__{pierre responds by mumbling something, and at the same time his hands are moving frenziedly around the wires.}
