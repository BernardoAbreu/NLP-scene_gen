<L>__{interior holidome elevator moments later}
<A>__{tim and orin silently ride the elevator to the fourth floor.}
<L>__{interior the tiffany suite moments later}
<A>__{orin opens the door to the tiffany suite, a slightly larger version of the junior suite. he ushers tim inside.}
<C>__{orin}
<P>__{(self deprecating, but proud)}
<D>__{tiffany suite. bit much. perks of the presidency, guess you'd say. please. have a seat on the davenport.}
<A>__{tim sits. orin goes to the mini fridge, takes out a sprite.}
<C>__{orin }
<D>__{drink?}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{ah, no. thanks.}
<C>__{orin}
<D>__{suit yourself.}
<A>__{orin opens the sprite, drinks. he reaches into a briefcase. he hands tim a document with dozens of signatures on it.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{this is the petition?}
<A>__{tim shakes his head as he reads the names.}
<C>__{orin}
<D>__{between you and me this was a ploy by mike pyle. trying to drive down the value of northlands so he could get it on the cheap.}
<A>__{just as deanzie predicted. orin snatches back the petition. he rips it in two.}
<C>__{orin }
<D>__{i just made that happen. poof. gone. rainmaker.}
<P>__{(makes rain gesture)}
<D>__{northlands keeps its three previous two diamond awards.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{oh my gosh, really? thank you.}
<A>__{orin sits next to tim on the couch, closer than he needs to.}
<C>__{orin}
<D>__{one thing roger lemke knew, tim? he knew that when you get all dolled up, go to the prom the big dance that you gotta be prepared to put out. to show a little teat.}
<P>__{(off tim's confused look)}
<D>__{you ever hear of paypal, tim?}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{paypal? um, yeah. i've used it to pay for beanie babies on e bay...}
<P>__{(guilty)}
<D>__{for my fiance.}
<C>__{orin}
<D>__{good. thing you gotta ask yourself now is this: "am i ready to dance? am i ready to show a little teat?"}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{i don't understand what you mean...}
<C>__{orin}
<D>__{calm down, orin. i'm sorry. please, let's talk e commerce for a minute.}
<A>__{tim hesitantly follows orin to the desk. a laptop sits open.}
<C>__{orin }
<D>__{four years ago, the brain trust at asmi national mandated we go "on line" for everything. billing, newsletter, the whole shebang. now i'm almost 70 years old i's about as likely to figure this deal out as i was to learn chinese. well, as you know roger lemke was a real whiz on the computer...}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{you bet.}
<C>__{orin}
<D>__{so roger's up here looking over this new system, and he gets one of these lightbulb going off kinda looks, the way he did. and he says, "orin, with that newsletter going digital you're saving almost four grand a year in printing costs alone. four grand. pure profit." you see where this is going, tim?}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{i can't say that i do...}
<C>__{orin}
<D>__{paypal. that's where. what has asmi ever given orin helgesson? huh? not dime one. sure as shoot not an opportunity to serve on the national board. have i not been a good president? do i not deserve a little something?}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{you're an awesome president...}
<C>__{orin}
<D>__{you're goddamn right i am!}
<A>__{orin pounds his fist on the desk. tim swallows hard.}
<C>__{orin }
<D>__{but i don't know the first blessed thing about this paypal deal. roger had the on line know how, not me.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{i'm still not reading you here...}
<C>__{orin}
<D>__{there aren't printing costs anymore, see? the asmi teer's digital. e commerce! don't you get it, tim? all that money almost 39 hundred dollars a year that goes into a paypal account now. my paypal account. but i've got no idea how to use it.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{do you literally mean you just need help, like, getting on line, or...?}
<C>__{orin}
<D>__{your performance in that scavenger hunt was first rate. then i see you in the pool making love to that floozy, i realize maybe you've got a bit of lemke's, shall we say, moral ambiguity. i need that.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{you're talking about stealing.}
<C>__{orin}
<D>__{pontoon boats don't pay for themselves, tim. roger lemke came to the prom. he showed me a little teat. i rewarded him with the two diamonds three years running. i'm prepared to do the same for you. what do you say? you take home those those two diamonds, northlands' value skyrockets, bill krogstad retires to his time share. everybody wins...}
<A>__{we push in on tim at the crossroads of all crossroads. outside, a clap of thunder booms ominously.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{i'd be doing it for northlands to keep it in brown valley and help my co workers. to help bill...}
<A>__{tim looks away, avoiding eye contact. then:}
<C>__{tim }
<D>__{what would you need me to do exactly...?}
<A>__{orin claps once, smiles like a proud grandparent.}
<C>__{orin}
<D>__{ok, marvelous!}
