<A>__{harry doesn't have a g suit or a helmet of anything. he just has his walky on his belt. inside the cramped cockpit, harry looks around for the lever which vectors the thrust. finds it, and sets it to 90 degrees (vertical). he bangs the canopy closed and brings the throttle up to full.}

<D>__{harry can fly anything.}
<A>__{the big plane wobbles off the ground like a drunken bumble bee.}
<C>__{gib}
<D>__{he's a little rusty. it's like riding a bicycle . . . you never forget. uh . . . i'd seek shelter!}
<A>__{it drifts sideways and everybody runs to get out of the way. at about six feet above the ground it slides sideways, clips the top of a cop car and knocks off the light bar. it lifts unsteadily straight into the sky. it turns around 180.}
<C>__{gib}
<D>__{he's got it.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{harry pushes the vector lever forward and the thrust nozzles turn, accelerating the plane forward.}
