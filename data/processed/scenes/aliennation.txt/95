<L>__{interior sykes' apartment night}
<A>__{jetson is talking rapidly in the alien language on the kitchen wall phone. sykes, foreground, takes the bottle of vodka from the refrigerator, throws some ice in a glass, pours himself a shot. as jetson is talking, he spots the carton of milk that sykes inadvertently left out of the refrigerator two nights ago. he sniffs it... his eyebrows do an involuntary movement. he finishes with his wife and hangs up. he watches sykes take a long pull on the vodka.}
<C>__{jetson}
<P>__{(holds up milk carton)}
<D>__{would you mind?}
<A>__{sykes shrugs, tosses him a glass. jetson pours the semi lumpy milk and takes a big swallow. sykes grimaces. then }
<C>__{sykes}
<P>__{(indicates phone)}
<D>__{so, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{my wife? she worries about me.}
<A>__{sykes leans against the counter, getting comfortable, his voice more weary then bitter.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{yeah... i know the routine.}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{you are married?}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{was. divorced.}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{we mate for life. divorce... is a strange concept to us.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{it's like having an eleventh finger removed. it hurts like hell, but you never really needed the damn thing in the first place.}
<A>__{jetson nods even though he doesn't really understand this. they drink... jetson gazes around.}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{your home is quite disordered. i thought perhaps you had been burglarized when i walked in.}
<C>__{sykes}
<P>__{(growling)}
<D>__{i appreciate your honesty, george.}
<A>__{he smacks his glass against jetson's. they drink.}
