<L>__{interior cheap hotel night}
<A>__{the room is ugly. shag carpeting, wood paneling and polyester patterned curtains. we hear a computer keyboard clicking away as we move across a table. the hotel phone is in a modem, which is held together with duct tape. between the modem and the computer is a scrambler constructed out of a series of naked circuit boards. it is a very similar set up to rath's, only it has been put together with a fraction of the resources. bain sits, typing at the computer, his shirt off. beside the desk top is a six pack of old style beer, a bag of doritos and his gameboy. on the floor, disassembled neatly on a small white towel is his cleaned gun. bain finishes punching in a code, sits back and sucks down his beer.}
<D>__{contractor screen where have you been, michael?}
<A>__{he belches. he is communicating with his general contractor. on the table is a collection of personal objects, much of it stuffed in pillow cases, taken from electra's house.}
