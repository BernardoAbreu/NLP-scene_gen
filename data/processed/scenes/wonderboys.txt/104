<A>__{sara and grady stand by as pete pupcik deposits james in the back of the squad car, slams the door.}
<B>__{pupcik}
<A>__{as i told the chancellor, professor, i'm. just going to run james here over to the university. it'll be up to dr. gaskell where we go from there. grady nods, leans in the window to james.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{don't worry, james, i will figure something out.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{i'm not worried. you're not worried, are you. professor tripp?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i'm a little worried, james.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{don't be. i don't care if they expel me. i probably should be expelled.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{well, let's see if we can keep that from happening.}
<A>__{james nods and grady starts to step back from the car.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{professor tripp...?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{yes, james.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{even if i end up going to jail....}
<A>__{james smiles his crooked grin.}
<C>__{james leer }
<D>__{you're still the best teacher i ever had.}
<A>__{on this, pete pupcik pulls away, leaving grady standing on the curb, watching the back of james' head, framed in the rear window of the police car, growing smaller.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{this is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education, grady.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{would walter really press charges?}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{it's within the realm. he takes his souvenirs pretty seriously. and he was just a wee bit prickly this morning.}
<A>__{grady, detecting something in sara's tone, turns, watches her take a drag on her cigarette.}
<C>__{sara }
<D>__{you didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, grady?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i think i might have.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{and what do you think you might have said?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i think i might've said i was in love with you.}
<A>__{sara's face remains .unchanged.}
<C>__{grady }
<D>__{he told you.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{he told me.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{and what did you say?}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i said it didn't sound like you.}
<A>__{sara tosses her cigarette in .the gutter, gets into her car, and dives away. grady looks after her sadly, then turns, sees crabtree standing on the porch wearing a shirt which claims "ativan chases the clouds away."}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{so what do we do now? ,}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{find the jacket.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{oh' huh. exactly how do we do that?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{first i see if hannah will let me borrow her car.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{it seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas.}
