<L>__{exterior bleachers day}
<A>__{freddy and holdaway sit on some bleachers in an empty little league baseball field.}
<C>__{holdaway}
<D>__{okay, we're gonna station men across the street from karina's fine jewelry. but their orders will be not to move in unless the robbery gets out of control. you gotta make sure they don't have to move in. you're inside to make sure that everything goes according to hoyle. we have men set up a block away from the warehouse rendezvous. they got complete visibility of the exterior. so as soon as joe cabot shows up, we'll see it.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{what's your visibility of the interior?}
<C>__{holdaway}
<D>__{we can't see shit on the inside. and we can't risk gettin any closer for fear they'll spot us.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{this is bullshit, jim. i get all the fuckin danger of having you guys in my back pocket but none of the safety.}
<C>__{holdaway}
<D>__{what's the matter, newendyke? job too tough for ya? no one lied to you. you always knew we'd hang back until joe cabot showed up.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{oh this is great. you ain't giving me no fuckin protection whatsoever. but you are giving me an attitude.}
<C>__{holdaway}
<D>__{since when does an undercover cop have protection? freddy, you came into this thing with your eyes wide open, so don't start screamin blind man now. i understand you're nervous. i wish the warehouse had more visible windows, but it doesn't. we have to make do with the cards we're dealt.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{i didn't say i wasn't gonna do it. i'm just remarking on how shitty the situation is!}
<C>__{holdaway}
<D>__{i don't mean to be harsh with ya, but i've found tough love works best in these situations. we have to get joe cabot in the company of the thieves and in the same vicinity as the loot. we don't care about these other bastards. we're willing to offer them good deals to testify against cabot.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{isn't this risk unorthodox?}
<C>__{holdaway}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{letting them go ahead with the robbery?}
<C>__{holdaway}
<D>__{the whole idea behind this operation is to catch joe cabot red handed. we bust these hired hands, we ain't accomplished shit. letting them go through with the heist is a risk, but cabot's jobs are very clean. we got people surrounding the perimeter. we got a guy and a gal on the inside posing as a couple shopping for rings. we could replace the employees with cops, but we'd run the risk of tipping 'em off.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{that's out. they know the faces of who works what shift.}
<C>__{holdaway}
<D>__{these guys are professionals. we're professionals. it's a risk, but i think it's a calculated risk.}
