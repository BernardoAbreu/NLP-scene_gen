<A>__{our pov rotates downwards onto an irregular shape. this shape is grey green and crammed with detail which emerges as we draw close like a continent seen from outer space. a fruit fly lands on it and we now recognise the shape as a patch of lichen. a number of other fruit flies are grazing there. wider. the lichen is on a rock. a black lizard climbs over the horizon stalking flies. a slow advance. a sudden rush. a fly is snapped up and mashed between toothless gums. the lizard is fixing its beady gaze on the next potential victim when... a shadow falls, the lizard tries to flee. a seabird grabs the lizard in its claws. death is sudden and bloody. the bird settles to eat. whizz...thunk. a sharpened stick flies out of nowhere and impales the bird through its wing. the wounded bird falls between boulders, flapping helplessly. the rest of the flock take to their air, calling and wheeling as... a crowd of local savages come racing over the larger horizon of the rocks armed with primitive bows and arrows, spears, rocks and throwing sticks... a child grabs the injured bird and kills it. an adult biffs the child on the head and steals the bird. the rest of the savages leap among the jagged rocks smiting each other, shouting and snarling among the whirling flock of birds.}

<C>__{darwin.}
<D>__{a touch of indigestion. it will pass.}

<A>__{in the darkened study, with his specimens and books all around him, darwin kneels by the box. steeling himself, he unlocks the padlock and opens the lid and takes out the papers and notebooks which are stored there. the bulk of it is a single manuscript, accumulated over many years, divided into 14 chapters with pages of notes interleaved. the chapters are headed. variation under domestication, variation under nature, struggle for existence, natural selection.... a noise behind him almost makes him jump out of his skin. its annie, ten years old in her checked dress, as she will always be in his imagination.}

<D>__{that's why i like it. it makes me cry.}
<A>__{she looks up from her shells and smiles winningly. darwin looks out to sea, at the bright crashing line of surf, and begins the familiar, much told tale:}

<D>__{once apon a time there was a family of orang u tangs living in the jungles of darkest borneo}
<L>__{exterior jungles of borneo. day}
<A>__{our pov moves between dark tropical trees to find a group of orangutans flopping around grooming each other. as with the land of the fuegan savages, there is something slightly artificial about these jungles, as though the trees really belong in kew gardens, and the naked jungle warriors, whom we now see stalking through them, are on loan from the museum of mankind.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{their eldest daughter was the most loving, caring and trusting orang of all.}
<A>__{we follow a young nimble female, swinging through the trees, revelling in her own gymnastic ability, until she stops hearing something: the sound of human speech.}

<D>__{but these qualities in themselves cannot guarantee an ape's survival. sometimes, quite the reverse.}
<A>__{native hunters are creeping through the undergrowth a warning screech from one of the orang u tangs posted as lookouts. most of the apes flee up into the canopy. jenny stays where she is, fascinated, just a moment longer than is prudent.}

<D>__{in london she had many admirers of whom your father was but one.}
<A>__{darwin moves forwards from the shadows, where he has been observing and taking notes. as the other humans move away be attempts to start a conversation with jenny in her own language, much in the way he communicated with baby annie.}

<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{hm?}
<A>__{he reaches in his pocket. this gets her interest. she comes closer, expecting food. darwin takers out a sprig of verbena a strongly scented herb. he holds in front of his nose and inhales, making contented expressions of pleasure. jenny watches. darwin holds the verbena towards jenny. cautiously she extends a hand through the bars. their fingers touch in space, like god giving life to adam. for darwin its a breakthrough a moment of connection. jenny eats the verbena and spits it out, shrieking angrily.}

<D>__{wait, sorry, wait i've got something else here for you}

<P>__{(pleasurable surprise)}
<D>__{ahhhh!!}
<A>__{he shows jenny her own reflection and, then hands the mirror through the bars. jenny takes the mirror, bites it, discovers it is inedible, and smashes it on the ground. charles makes a sad, whining sound}

<P>__{(pouting)}
<D>__{hmph.}
<A>__{meaning: "ok then, i'm sorry." it's such a complex human reaction grudging contrition that charles laughs aloud with pleasure. jenny laughs. charles takes out a mouth organ and plays a snatch of chopin. jenny covers her ears and chatters.

<A>__{he sees an envelope on the ground and stoops to retrieve it.}
<C>__{innes}
<D>__{you dropped this. what a beautiful postage stamp.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{yes. it is from the spice islands.}
<C>__{innes}
<D>__{i do rather envy your wide circle of correspondents. in my youth i always wanted to travel.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{you are still young. you could be a missionary and follow in mr livingstone's footsteps.}
<C>__{innes}
<D>__{yes, although i have always felt there is quite enough evil at home without looking for it abroad.}
<P>__{(then, casually)}
<D>__{mrs darwin told me of the book you are writing.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{not any more, thank goodness}
<C>__{innes}
<D>__{you have finished it?}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{it has been finished for me. my correspondent in the spice islands has arrived independently at exactly the same idea, expressed in a mere twenty pages.}
<C>__{darwin }
<D>__{there's brevity for you. i had so far covered two hundred an fifty and come to a dead end. so finally i am rid of the project.}
<A>__{innes is relieved to hear it}
<C>__{innes}
<D>__{the lord moves in mysterious ways.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{he does indeed mr innes. i was reflecting only the other day on the fact that he has endowed us in his blessed generosity with not one but nine hundred species of intestinal worm each with its own unique method of infiltrating the blood supply and burrowing through the mucosa.}
<A>__{innes shifts uncomfortably.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{and then again on the great love he shows for butterflies by inventing a wasp to lay eggs inside the living flesh of caterpillars}
<C>__{innes}
<D>__{well. it is not for us to guess at his reasons.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{no. we can leave that for mr wallace now. should i advise him to stay overseas do you think? if he shows his face in kent he may be required to kneel on rock salt.}
<A>__{innes rises. he's a short man, acutely aware of any threats to his dignity, and he's had enough of this mockery}
<C>__{innes}
<D>__{i once valued our friendship mr darwin. i had hoped it might be possible to restore it. clearly in your present mood that is not going to be possible. my regards to mrs darwin}
<A>__{he starts off round the corner of the house. darwin listens to his footsteps receding, then turns his face back to the sun. when he opens his eyes sees a figure standing in the lawn. it is annie, plain as day, scowling at him angrily.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{what? i am forestalled by mr wallace. that is the simple fact of it. what reason do you have to be angry?!}
<A>__{she shoots him a look of hatred then turns away from him and runs off towards the meadow. darwin, instantly remorseful, gets to his feet and hurries after her.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{annie!}
<A>__{he reaches the centre of the lawn and stopped by a sudden intense pain in the gut which strikes him like a blow and fells him to his knees. he lies their gasping, his vision clouding as the pages of the wallace letter slip from his grasp and are scattered to the wind. a view from high above: spiralling downwards on the darwin garden, as household servants emerge from various quarters and hurry to his assistance.}

<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{...barely half of it}

<C>__{hooker }
<D>__{it is clearly made worse in times of overwork but the nature of the work is irrelevant. this is not visited on you by god or the devil. this is a set of physical symptoms. go to malvern and get treated.}

<D>__{not malvern}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{why not. what is there to be scared of there. he has worked for you in the past it will work again. then come back and finish the book. your enemies are already toasting their good fortune but they shall not prevail.}

<D>__{what are you talking about. i have no enemies.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{they are legion, believe me, and they are implacable. we are all of us fighting a battle against fear and superstition but we can win this battle. we must win it. you can win it for all of us. go to malvern, then come back and finish it.}

<C>__{gully}
<D>__{he suggests we have thoughts which do not actually enter the realm of consciousness. nervous fibres exist after all throughout the whole body. is it not possible that certain primal feelings manifest in some physical way. eczema. boils. a fever. might some blocked passion imitate a gall stone? or even manufacture one.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{well, until someone devises a machine to read nervous impulses, or a telescope to look inside the body i suppose we can only guess at it.}
