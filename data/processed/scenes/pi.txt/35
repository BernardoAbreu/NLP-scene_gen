<A>__{max rushes to the subway when a honking horn stops him. a limo pulls up next to him. marcy dawson jumps out of the car}
<C>__{marcy dawson}
<D>__{mr. cohen? mr. cohen? please stop for a second mr. cohen?}
<A>__{max stops and faces marcy.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{damn it already! stop following me. i'm not interested in your money. i'm searching for a way to understand our world. i'm searching for perfection. i don't deal with mediocre materialistic people like you!}
<C>__{marcy dawson}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i'm very sorry. i admit i've been a bit too aggressive. but all i ask is for five minutes of your time. here...}
<A>__{marcy hands max a metal stopwatch.}
<C>__{marcy dawson}
<D>__{...a stopwatch. already ticking. allow me the four and a half minutes left let me tell you what i want. let me tell you what i can offer you. afterwards, if you don't want to talk to me, then fine, we part as friends and i promise that you will never see me again. that's fair, isn't it?}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(after a moment, he looks at the stopwatch)}
<D>__{go.}
<C>__{marcy dawson}
<D>__{good. it's funny, even though we have different aims and different goals we're actually incredibly alike. we both seek the same thingperfection. i know... clearly we're seeking different types of perfection, but that is what makes us perfect candidates for a fruitful partnership. if you let me, i can be your greatest ally. take the acacia tree...in east africa. it is the most prevalent plant in all of kenya because it has managed to secure its niche by defeating its major predator, the giraffe. to accomplish this, the tree has made a contract with a highly specialized red ant. the tree has evolved giant spores which act as housing for the ants in return for shelter, the ants supply defense. when a giraffe starts to eat the tree's leaves, the shaking branch acts like an alarm. the ants charge out and secrete an acid onto the giraffe's tongue. the giraffe learns its lesson and never returns. without each other, the tree would be picked dry and the ants would have no shade from the brutal african sun both would die. but with each other, they succeed, they survive, they surpass. they have different aims, different goals but they work together. max, we would like to establish a mutually benefiting alliance with you.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(handing back the stopwatch)}
<D>__{i'm not interested.}
<C>__{marcy dawson}
<D>__{allow me to dose.}
<A>__{the chauffeur pulls a black suitcase out of the limo and brings it over.}
<C>__{marcy dawson}
<D>__{as a sign of good faith we wish to offer you this.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i told you i don't want money.}
<C>__{marcy dawson}
<D>__{the suitcase isn't filled with fifties or gold or diamonds. just silicon. a ming mecca chip.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(yeah right!)}
<D>__{ming mecca. they're not declassified.}
<A>__{max starts to move away.}
<C>__{marcy dawson}
<D>__{you're right. they're not. but lancet percy has many friends. come here, take a look.}

<P>__{(stuttering)}
<D>__{what do...do...}
<A>__{but then, max notices that his thumb is twitching.}
<C>__{marcy dawson}
<D>__{beautiful, isn't it? you know how rare...are you okay?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{yeah, i got to go.}
