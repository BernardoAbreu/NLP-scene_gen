<L>__{exterior patio day}
<A>__{devaney slides the file across the table at frank, open ing it. inside are letters of every size and condition. repeatedly throughout this scene frank's gaze is drawn to fletcher, who has started his boat again.}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{this is just in the last six months.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(looks at the pile)}
<D>__{have you ever tried having these professionally assessed?}
<A>__{devaney shakes his head no. frank begins to look through the letters, flipping them by the corner of the page. from many different sources, some are scrawled, some typed, some assembled from cutouts. many are soiled and torn, others immaculate. occasionally, one will have a photo of rachel with crude markings on it. spector enters sucking on a popsicle. he comes to stand over frank's shoulder, peering nonchalantly at the piles of letters.}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{devaney says you were in the secret service.}
<A>__{frank nods. frank goes through them quickly, with an expert eye. he sometimes pauses to read one more carefully. a few he removes from the stack and places in the center of the table.}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{ever guard the main man?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i was two years with carter and four years with reagan.}
<A>__{frank sets another letter in the center pile. he stops, smiling at it.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{this is a little old lady in akron. she's written to everybody i've ever worked for.}
<A>__{he continues to turn until something stops him. several letters are paper clipped together. they are the pasted up type we saw being assembled on the desk top.}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{reagan got shot.}
<A>__{his chatter is beginning to annoy frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{not on my shift.}
<A>__{spector emits a gratuitous laugh, acknowledges the joke.}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{that's good.}
<A>__{frank goes back to his letters. he taps the stack in the center of the table.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{at first glance, these don't bother me. but keep them. you never know.}
<A>__{he separates one letter from the others.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{this could be something.}
<A>__{devaney searches frank's face.}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{you think it could be the same guy? the one who rigged the doll?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i don't know. did you tell miss marron about it? does she know about the doll?}
<A>__{devaney and spector exchange looks. this is evidently a sore point between them.}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{we said there'd been some electrical problem while she was on stage. short circuit. look, she doesn't need that kind of worry right now. it would upset her.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what about the police?}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{there was no reason for the police. no one got hurt.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what about the chauffeur?}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{it was nothing. it was just our people there.}
<A>__{frank turns and watches fletcher by the pool. devaney's eyes are still on frank's face.}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{sy, i think we should show him the room.}
