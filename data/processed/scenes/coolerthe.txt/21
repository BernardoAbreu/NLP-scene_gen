<A>__{buddy stafford, the paradise lounge's star attraction, is performing on stage. he's a poor man's tony bennett. mid to late 60's. a staple at the paradise for the last 20 years. the singer sluggishly descends the stage to the lounge floor, almost tripping over his microphone cable. buddy works the room, leaning in real close to the ladies, delivering the requisite eye contact. when their companions react with mock outrage, buddy raises his fists playfully in a boxer's defensive stance. it's classic buddy stafford schtick. from somewhere across the lounge, an attractive woman jumps up and throws her panties at buddy. buddy catches them and waves them in the air... just as another pair whizzes by... we pan across to shelly seated at his corner booth, in the company of nicky fingers, larry and marty. tight on shelly as he focuses on buddy. a smile threatens his patented stoicism. he's flashing back on the old days. while nicky and marty are clearly enjoying buddy's performance, larry fixates on the singer with joyless eyes. we take on larry's pov of buddy slow motion close ups of buddy singing. the music slowed down with the action, emphasizing buddy's lack of energy. sweat dripping off buddy's forehead, splattering into tiny jewels against his microphone. buddy's tired eyes. shaking hands around the mic.}
