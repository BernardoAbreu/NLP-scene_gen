<A>__{from the blackness before the first images, we hear a young woman's tortured scream, muffled by her own will. we see her mouth, open in agony; her face, beaded with sweat. her name is anne, and she is queen of france. she lies in}
<B>__{a royal bedchamber}
<A>__{the royal doctor kneels at the foot of her bed; her own royal mother grips her hands... on the opposite side of the huge bedchamber, and separated from the queen's bed by an artistically painted screen, are royal advisors sweating and anxious for any word to take to their king. they wince as the queen moans again in the pain of childbirth. her fingers claw out for help, but her doctor ignores her need to be touched and comforted; he is concerned only for the baby. only her priest, father belles, sits at her head, stroking her hair gently and rapidly whispering prayers.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{the head is born! one arm... the other arm... it is a boy!}
<A>__{the advisors, disregarding the queen's privacy, scurry around the screen to see the doctor lift the beautiful baby, wet with birth. the mother the queen is still in agony, yet she struggles to lift her head.}
<C>__{advisor 1}
<D>__{i shall tell the king!}
<C>__{advisor 2}
<D>__{i shall tell him!}
<A>__{they hurry for the door. but their race to be first to bring this great news to the king is interrupted as the queen emits another cry; it surprises the doctor.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{m'lady...?}
<A>__{he kneels again to examine the queen.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{another...? it is another!}
<A>__{the joy vanishes from the faces of the advisors. they look gravely at each other, as they hear a second baby's cry.}

<A>__{a dark courtyard night a door groans open in a hidden corner of the palace courtyard and into the darkness steps a dashing figure. his face is hidden in shadow, but we know from the silhouette of his cloak and plumed hat that he is a musketeer. he carries an oblong basket. a carriage is just rattling onto the flagstones of the courtyard. the musketeer steps into its interior, with a sharp word to the driver }

<L>__{exterior establishing the island fortress prison day}
<A>__{on a gash of rock thrusting upward from the sea along the southern coast of france stands an island fortress, a prison, like an alcatraz of the mediterranean. just off a coastline renowned for its beauty, the fortress is horrible and foreboding. as we superimpose:}
<D>__{twenty two years later}
<L>__{interior the fortress prison}
<A>__{with the camera as our moving pov, we survey the prison. it is a horrible place: dungeons where prisoners lie in their own filth; corners where jailers rut with unresisting captive women; long twisting corridors lined with cells, from which prisoners whimper, or moan in madness. up a long winding staircase our pov moves; we push through the barred window of a cell... it is somewhat cleaner than the rest of the places we've seen, but still a prison. we pan the cell. and we see a man. a man in an iron mask. it is terrifying, to think of anyone imprisoned in this way. we push in on his eyes... they are blue, childlike. a greasy jailer the prisoner's keeper puts his face to the barred window of the door, and speaks with bored cruelty.}

<C>__{paris}
<L>__{exterior paris street night}
<A>__{through the narrow streets of the old city gallops a dashing figure, his cloak flying behind him and catching the moonlight, his horse's hooves clattering along the cobblestones as he dodges the beggars living in the filthy shadows. he is a magnetic sight, riding the horse as easily as if they were racing across an open field and not through a cluttered street, and guiding the stallion as if its grace and power came not from the animal but from the rider. sitting lightly in the saddle is d'artagnan famous musketeer, captain of the king's royal bodyguard. he is still handsome at mid life, still erect, unambiguous in his courage and his loyalty. he rides past a knot of angry beggars, moving through the streets breaking windows and scavenging for food. when they see d'artagnan, some throw rocks at him. they sail by d'artagnan's head; he ducks them with the fluid grace of a boxer dodging punches, and keeps on riding.}
<B>__{outside the cathedral}
<A>__{d'artagnan rides into the courtyard of a grand old residence beside notre dame cathedral. priests are dispensing food to beggars gathered in the courtyard. as d'artagnan reins his horse to a stop the wretched people stare with contempt at the royal symbols on his uniform. but d'artagnan is not a man anyone would be quick to confront; as he dismounts and moves toward the doorways the people part for him. he pauses as he sees, parked to one side of the old residence, a big rickety carriage. d'artagnan smiles.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{porthos too!}
<A>__{d'artagnan hears drunken feminine giggles echoing down the staircase of the tower above him.}
<L>__{interior priests' residence a stairway day}
<A>__{four people are moving up a winding stairway; three are women, bosoms spilling from their gaudy dresses; the fourth is porthos, the former musketeer, now a nobleman of great wealth and even greater girth. he and the women are drinking wine as they stagger up the stairs, the women towing porthos like rowboats tugging a ship to dock. porthos is not so drunk that his hands fail to find pleasant places to grip their bodies as they walk and giggle.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{ah ha! here we are! aramis! porthos is here!}
<A>__{they reach a doorway. porthos kicks it open, staggers back, and begins shoving the women inside.}
<L>__{interior a priest's apartment day}
<A>__{the first of the partying women tumbles inside; she stops short at what she sees. the second and third stumble in after her and they too stop dead still, sobered by what they see. then with a great roar porthos barrels in.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{aaaaaaaramis!! porthos is }
<A>__{he stops dead in his tracks. from the pov of porthos and the women, we see aramis. always the most theological of the musketeers, and ruthlessly brilliant, he is still lean and powerful. and still handsome, or at least he would be; but now he kneels before a single candle at a private altar, wearing sackcloth and ashes in penitent prayer.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{sorry, my dears. you would have enjoyed it too. he's hung like a donkey.}
<C>__{wench 1}
<D>__{so are you.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{really? i haven't been able to see it for fifteen years. go on now, leave his holiness alone. i will bring you back tomorrow when he's in a better mood.}
<A>__{he whacks their bottoms, herding them out, then swaggers to aramis, heaving himself to a seat beside his praying friend.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{please revel with me, aramis, i need my spirits lifted. i'm old, i'm weak, my strength is gone }
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{be quiet, you fat fool. can't you see i'm praying?}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{i just said you're praying! are you deaf too? i know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.}
<C>__{aramis}
<P>__{(trying to ignore him)}
<D>__{there are more important things than tits.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{really? if you can name me one thing, one single thing, that is more sublime than the feel of a plump pink nipple between my lips, i will buy you a new cathedral.}
<A>__{aramis is still trying to pray, but rises to the bait.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{forgiveness.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{forgiveness?}
<A>__{as if in reply, porthos lets rip an enormous rolling fart.}
<C>__{porthos}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{forgive me.}
<A>__{aramis' fingers clamp down on the rosary beads, as he tries to keep praying.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{am i forgiven?}
<A>__{aramis abruptly backhands his huge friend. porthos reels backwards, landing in a chair.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{i observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{can't you see i'm praying, goddammit?!}
<A>__{porthos raises a foot and kicks the bishop in the balls. aramis staggers back and grabs a chair to throw it; porthos picks up the whole table just as d'artagnan enters.}
<C>__{porthos and aramis}
<D>__{d'artagnan.}
<A>__{porthos tosses the table aside and bear hugs d'artagnan.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{how are you, you skinny little pup!}
<A>__{aramis sets the chair down in embarrassment.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{a simple theological discussion.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{aramis the king wishes to see you.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{still you serve him loyally though people hurl rotten eggs at his royal emblem.}
<A>__{aramis lifts d'artagnan's cloak as evidence: near its hem, sure enough, is the remnant of a broken egg.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i see your mind is sharp as ever. the king said, "right away." cut deep and hard, my friends.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{deep and hard, d'artagnan.}
<A>__{d'artagnan clasps porthos' hand, then that of aramis, and leaves, as porthos shakes his head.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{we were all musketeers once, eh? oh, i forgot. for the poor, the ones you were praying for.}
<A>__{he hands a purse to aramis. surprised, even touched, aramis reaches for it. just as he takes the money, porthos throws a haymaker; but aramis sees the sucker punch coming and ducks. suddenly the two old warriors are circling again.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{i wonder how athos is doing.}
<L>__{interior a small house day}
<A>__{athos stands at the dressing table in a modest room; dressed in a dark plain coat, he too is a former musketeer gray haired and handsome, intensely intelligent, with a hard crust of manners masking seas of emotion. he opens a small wooden box and digs through medals of heroism; he finds what he's looking for just as his son raoul enters. raoul is in his mid twenties; he wears the uniform of a soldier in the french army. he is nervous, pacing, looking at every angle in the mirror.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{do i look all right?}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{none of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{i care only about michelle. should i ask her when we first arrive? or... or when we're leaving? i could ask her in the carriage but it is more romantic at the palace. i get so confused...}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{perhaps this will help.}
<A>__{he hands raoul the simple gold ring he took from the box.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{mother's ring. i can't take this.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{she died giving you to me. and i want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves.}
<A>__{they embrace. athos' eyes mist, but he smiles.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{now go, and bring back your fiance.}
<A>__{establishing the royal palace day the palace glows golden in the parisian sunshine. carriages deposit guests for the lavish party in the royal gardens.}
<L>__{exterior the royal palace gardens day}
<A>__{attractive young adults strut about in the extravagant attire of louis xiv's france, the men like peacocks, the ladies in gowns that seem to squeeze their entire bodies up into their bosoms. they laugh and smile and strike courtly poses pretending to talk with each other but all eyes are on the doorway, through which the king is about to come...}
<B>__{just beyond that palace doorway}
<A>__{king louis the fourteenth is having his wardrobe adjusted by a flock of tailors. he is twenty two, and would be quite handsome, except for the total self absorption. he's checking himself in a full length golden mirror as two of his advisors, pierre and claude, try to speak with him.}
<C>__{pierre}
<D>__{your majesty, i know it is a... a festive time, but before }
<C>__{king louis}
<D>__{the blue sash. no, the burgundy!}
<C>__{pierre}
<D>__{... before the party begins }
<C>__{king louis}
<D>__{the party has already begun so why are you delaying me?}
<C>__{pierre}
<D>__{we do not wish to delay you, majesty, but... as your advisors, we feel it is our our }
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{... our duty.}
<C>__{pierre}
<D>__{yes! it is our duty to let you know... there are riots in paris.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{riots? my people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth. why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?}
<C>__{pierre}
<D>__{well yes, of course, majesty, and i'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{sometimes the poor do grow hungry. but why would they riot about it?}
<A>__{as he says this, a replica of the matterhorn made of fruits and meringues is carried past the window by a team of chefs.}
<C>__{pierre}
<D>__{majesty... we have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week. if we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before }
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{aramis! i have been expecting you!}
<P>__{(to the tailors)}
<D>__{we are satisfied, that will do.}
<A>__{the tailors and advisors withdraw as aramis still in his simple priest's robe strides forward and bows to the kind.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{your birthday celebration, your majesty?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{next week. this is a mere garden party and i wish to join it, so i will be brief. i am experiencing resistance from the jesuits.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{well... perhaps you should speak with them, your majesty.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i have demanded it and common priests present themselves! can you imagine the arrogance? common jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order! no one can keep secrets like the jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold. even the pope himself does not know who leads the jesuit order in france! he suspects the governor general of jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become pope himself.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{how can i serve you in this?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the jesuits is. you are now a priest, but you were once a musketeer, serving the throne of france, a throne ordained of god. can you accept this mission, and keep it private?}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{if i find out the identity of this jesuit rebel. i will kill both him and the man who told me.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{once a musketeer, always a musketeer, eh?}
<A>__{aramis bows and louis turns back to his mirror. there are mirrors everywhere in his palace, and he loves his reflection, adorned as he is all in golden cloth, like fabric from the sun. aramis leaves and the advisors return.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{ah yes, the riots. we have food stocks on the wharves right now, no?}
<C>__{pierre}
<D>__{that food has spoiled. that is why it was not shipped to the army.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{exactly why it should be given away.}
<C>__{pierre}
<D>__{what... an excellent idea, your majesty!}
<L>__{exterior palace gardens day}
<A>__{among the guests are raoul and michelle, a stunningly beautiful young woman. michelle is awed by the richness all around them, while raoul sees only her. he holds the ring.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{isn't it glorious!}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{michelle...}
<A>__{but just as he starts to speak, trumpets blast and the king steps through the doors and out into the lavish gardens; the party goers give him a rousing ovation. raoul returns the ring to his jacket, to wait for another moment. everyone watches the king, who begins guzzling wine and telling jokes to his sycophants, who howl at the king's witticisms. then louis catches sight of raoul and michelle, and lowers his voice, to his friends...}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{who is that?}
<C>__{friend 1}
<D>__{raoul, son of athos.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{not the soldier, you idiot!}
<C>__{friend 2}
<D>__{her name is michelle.}
<A>__{the king is transfixed. d'artagnan is presiding over a huddle of fresh faced young musketeers, directing them to their positions around the gardens, like secret service agents protecting a president. he leaves them, and quickly moves to the king.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{your majesty...}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{what is it, d'artagnan? assassins falling from the sky now?}
<A>__{the sycophants laugh loudly.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{the plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i decided it this morning.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{then you must allow me to stay close to you so that }
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i am king, d'artagnan. i will change my mind as i wish, and i will enjoy my banquet as i wish!}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{but i deployed the royal guards according to your previous }
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{let us play a game, d'artagnan, let us pretend i am king and you are captain of my musketeers. let us behave as if my wish is law. and my wish is to enjoy this party!}
<A>__{d'artagnan bows sharply as the young sycophants chuckle. d'artagnan retreats, then looks back to louis and follows his gaze to the tender young beauty who caught his eye. d'artagnan recognizes raoul, son of his friend athos.}
<B>__{raoul and michelle}
<A>__{as the guests mix and mingle, raoul tries again.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{michelle, i... ever since i returned i've been wanting to speak with you about... about }
<A>__{a gaunt servant interrupts, presenting a tray of delicacies.}
<C>__{servant}
<D>__{monsieur, mademoiselle...?}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{no! thank you michelle, i }
<A>__{they are interrupted by the squeal of a piglet, squirming in the hands of the king's dwarf, who holds the fat little animal above his head and runs among the startled guests.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{it pleases us to announce an entertainment for our guests! a contest of agility and cunning!}
<A>__{he takes the pig from his dwarf; the pig is clean and perfumed, a colorful fake horn tied onto its head.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{behold our unicorn! whichever of our guests captures the unicorn shall win its treasure!}
<A>__{with this announcement the king produces a diamond the size of a pecan, suspended from a ribbon; the guests gasp at its richness. the king ties the diamond around the pig's neck.}
<B>__{raoul and michelle}
<A>__{michelle is amazed at this.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{i have never seen a diamond so large!}
<A>__{it almost makes raoul ashamed of the modest ring hidden in his hand.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{into the maze! all of you! disperse, i command you!}
<A>__{the dwarf releases the pig, poking him through a tiny break in the hedge; the critter skitters as only a pig can, eluding the first laughing lunges of the guests. the pig chase is a merry melee, as the maze becomes a tangle of confusion. louis climbs to a platform above the top of the ten foot hedge that forms the maze. from his perch he looks down on all the action, and calls encouragement.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{are you men or mice?!}
<A>__{michelle squeals as the pig scurries by and raoul dives for it. he almost has the pig... then it kicks free.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{the pendant will be yours!}
<A>__{with that he races after the pig. michelle tries to follow, this way, that way, through the maze. then she stops, face to face with the king, entering through a gate hidden in one of the maze's dead corners.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{michelle, isn't it?}
<A>__{speechless, she nods.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i would have said it was impossible, but i believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{sire, i }
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{you blush! you do not wish to be beautiful to your king?}
<A>__{her eyes go still; she understands what is happening. from behind the gate, we see d'artagnan, watching as louis tries to seduce the young woman. even as d'artagnan watches, the pig comes rooting through the hedge; with a deft movement d'artagnan catches the animal's leg and lifts it with the sureness of the farm boy he once was. the pig is quiet and comfortable in d'artagnan's hands. d'artagnan watches as the king approaches michelle, and she allows him to touch her cheek. the king leans to kiss her... michelle does not move... whheeekkkk! the pig sails over the gate and hits the ground running, right at louis' feet; it sets him dancing. the spell of the king's royal attention is shattered; as the pig scrambles away, michelle backs away.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{wait! michelle, i }
<A>__{too late, he sees the shadow of the man looming above him, leaping down onto him from the observation platform. it is the servant who offered the tray to raoul and michelle; he has armed himself with a knife from the carving table, and is diving now to plunge the blade into the king's throat. the king is helpless, frozen. the assassin leaps, falling toward the king... and is impaled on the sword of d'artagnan, springing through the gate to save his king. michelle screams, the king gasps, and the assassin drops, mortally wounded. they stare down at him now; the would be assassin gurgles words through his agony...}
<C>__{assassin}
<D>__{feed... your... people.}
<A>__{party guests, having heard michelle scream, are running in to find them. michelle rushes off, to find raoul; several people are coming up.}
<C>__{assassin}
<D>__{your people starve...! feed }
<A>__{the king snatches out his own dagger and imperiously cuts the throat of the dying man, to stop these offensive words. the king looks at his stunned subjects.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{a pitiful madman, nothing more. come, let us continue our chase! where is our unicorn?}
<A>__{the king prances away. it takes the guests a moment, but they know that only gaiety will please their king, and off they go again, laughing as if nothing happened. d'artagnan stands still as the young musketeers under his command come rushing up with swords drawn.}
<C>__{young musketeer}
<D>__{captain!}
<A>__{seeing the dead assassin, their eyes fill with admiration.}
<C>__{young musketeer}
<D>__{you are the best }
<A>__{d'artagnan can't even listen; with a last glance at the king he turns quickly and walks away.}

<D>__{thank you, keeper.}
<A>__{not watching what he's doing, the bulbous keeper trips on something and stumbles, dropping the food. the prisoner jumps to his feet, concerned.}

<L>__{interior palace d'artagnan's room evening}
<A>__{d'artagnan's room is spartan: a cot, and weapons laid on a plain table. it has a single small window, and d'artagnan stands at it now, looking out into the palace garden below. the guests have all gone home; the party pavilions have been cleared away. and now in the blue dusk, a solitary lady walks. she is anne of austria, the queen mother, the lady we saw in the opening. now, twenty years later, she is a slim frail figure. her clothes are drab and simple, like the dress of mourning; she walks in silence, watched at a distance by nun attendants. she glances up, and sees d'artagnan's form in the window. when he sees her looking, he pulls away from the window.}

<D>__{you can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i have ordered a drill of the royal guard for midnight, and must be clear headed for it.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{midnight! mon dieu! driving the youngsters hard, eh?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{they must stay sharp. there was an attempt on the king's life today.}

<D>__{i heard your playing.}

<D>__{athos...}
<A>__{but whatever it is that d'artagnan wants to say is interrupted by the sound of someone climbing the stairs. as athos' face brightened with the arrival of d'artagnan, now it glows as he jumps up to welcome his son.}

<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{we were at her door. i was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady in waiting for the queen mother.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{michelle cannot possibly accept!}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{she cannot possibly refuse. her family is poor, they have even less money than we do. and along with the invitation, the king sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.}

<D>__{goodbye, father. i am sorry.}

<A>__{raoul breaks away, and runs from the room. athos, so joyful moments before, holds his head as if his brain might erupt.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{this cannot be. everyone knows the queen mother is a recluse, and the ladies in waiting are but mistresses for the king!}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{if the young woman truly loves raoul }
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{she's a woman, d'artagnan! from a poor family. you may still be young enough to believe love conquers everything, but i am old and hard and i've seen too much. even when kings are hunchbacks they have any woman they desire, because power seduces even more than love!}

<C>__{athos}
<D>__{oh my friend.}
<A>__{athos grips d'artagnan in gratitude and desperate hope.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i will also speak with the king, for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to mademoiselle beaufort has caused.}

<A>__{slowly at first the paupers stand and shuffle forward. as the soldiers begin handing out foodstuffs bread, cabbages, tomatoes, eggs those nearest the wagon begin to jostle each other, and a large crowd gathers quickly.}

<D>__{no need to fight, there is plenty for all!}
<A>__{it's looking like a holiday celebration... until a ruffian breaks open a loaf of bread, and wrinkles his nose.}
<C>__{ruffian}
<D>__{this stuff stinks. it is rotting! the king gives us rotten food!}
<A>__{he hurls the moldy bread back at the soldiers. other paupers sniff the food, and its stink set off an explosion of anger: they throw food at the soldiers... then a paving stone crashes through a shop window, and suddenly it's a riot, with the mob overwhelming the soldiers and dragging them down the streets in the direction of the palace. d'artagnan, riding toward the palace himself, turns a corner and sees the mob coming. and they see him: the elegant, dashing musketeer on the prancing stallion. and at that moment, two more soldiers race out of a side street, fleeing a similar mob, coming from another direction. d'artagnan understands everything at a glance; the second pair of fleeing soldiers reach him in panic.}

<D>__{no! run to the palace and close the gates. but do not fire!}

<D>__{come on! to the palace!}
<A>__{d'artagnan sits calmly in their way. he doesn't even draw his sword, though members of the mob grab the reins of his horse. some of the mob recognize him, and murmur...}

<A>__{with that one of the rioters hurls a moldy beet at d'artagnan, who draws his sword in a slick liquid movement, he cuts the vegetable from the air. the display of expertise is startling. someone else throws a head of lettuce; d'artagnan slices it in half, and as the pieces fly he skewers one with the point of his sword.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i'm on my way to a salad! doesn't anybody have any endive?}
<A>__{the mob laughs at this panache, and the amazing display of swordsmanship that lies behind it. someone tosses more lettuce, and d'artagnan divides and skewers this one as well. this time the crowd applauds.}

<D>__{a tomato?}
<A>__{can he do it? someone fires a tomato right at his head, and sure enough d'artagnan spears it. then, with a victorious flourish, he takes a bite of it. his face contorts with the taste, and he spits the pieces out; the crowd is hushed.}

<D>__{you are right. it is rotten. i will speak to the king myself. you have my word.}
<A>__{the mob is completely won over by d'artagnan; the ruffian, angry that his riot is fizzling, raises his knife again over the soldiers, but now the point of d'artagnan's sword flicks to the ruffian's neck.}

<D>__{and you will release those men for they serve france... and you.}

<D>__{three cheers for d'artagnan! hurrah...!! hurrah...!!}
<A>__{the soldiers who moments before were about to be ripped apart now stand and look at d'artagnan in gratitude and awe. the mob has forgotten them; they see only d'artagnan as he rakes his blade clean, returns it to its scabbard, reins his horse around, and slowly rides away, escorting the soldiers back toward the palace.}

<C>__{aramis' voice}
<D>__{a priest, even a pope, he could kill without hesitation, but he was afraid to kill you, for his whole claim to power rests on the sanctity of royal blood. so he had you hidden in a way that only a monster could devise. i know, for it was i who took you to prison, and the iron mask. someday i will ask your forgiveness. but not until we have restored to you what is yours.}

<D>__{phillippe... there is something i hope you understand. terrible cruelty has been used against you. and... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.}
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{there is... wrath... in me. i have learned to hide it. those years in the cell, i dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened. now i am free. and with each free breath i feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all i lost. look at this, all this that for ten years i could not see! what if i become a king a king no different from my brother?}

<D>__{the desire for vengeance... can be a poison.}

<D>__{poor phillippe!}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{the mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected. do you notice?}

<D>__{he was my blood and i demand to know what happened to him.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{why would you ask now? you never asked before!}

<C>__{athos}
<D>__{phillippe...?}
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{how did you }
<A>__{they open the door and release him from the cell, but not from the mask. he tries to hug athos. they head back the way they came.}
<L>__{exterior paris streets night}
<A>__{louis and his platoon of young musketeers ride through the streets, scattering the paupers who sleep there.}
<L>__{interior bastille various shots night}
<A>__{back up the stairs... through one corridor... they start up the second flight of stairs, then stop and scramble back.}
<C>__{aramis}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{someone's coming!}
<A>__{they take cover on either side of the corridor, and lift their swords. it's a man coming down the stairs, with a hooded lantern... they raise their swords to strike }
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{d'artagnan!}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{the way is blocked above. the captain of the bastille has turned back from the mission i sent him on, and is in the courtyard with a party of men.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{he lies. he is here to trap us.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i came to see you safely out. check for yourself.}
<A>__{porthos climbs the stairs to check; d'artagnan looks at phillippe, in the mask.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{all you have suffered, i would gladly have borne myself, to keep it from you.}
<A>__{athos spits on the floor, in derision. but porthos comes barreling back down the stairway.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{d'artagnan is right, the courtyard is filling with soldiers!}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{this way.}
<A>__{he leads them quickly down a side corridor; the others have no choice but to follow.}
<B>__{a side corridor}
<A>__{d'artagnan leads them around another corner, into a long corridor; at the end of it is a massive door. they reach it, and d'artagnan produces a set of keys marked with the royal seal of the musketeers; he begins unlocking the three padlocks that secure the door.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{they will know you helped us, if we go this way.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{that doesn't matter now.}
<A>__{they open the door... and as they do they see louis and his platoon of young musketeers arriving outside.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{there! stop them!}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{betrayed!}
<A>__{the young musketeers serving the king jump from their horses and grab for the door; but d'artagnan leaps forward, his sword flashing. after a second of surprise, athos, aramis and porthos jump forward too, and there is a brief, bloody skirmish at the door. but the young musketeers have overwhelming numbers, and firearms too; protecting phillippe, the old musketeers draw back inside and succeed at pulling the door shut and latching it quickly.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{back the way we came!}
<A>__{they race back up the corridor the four musketeers, and phillippe, in the iron mask and turn the corner. they reach another inner door, pass through it and see the soldiers of the bastille coming at them.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{back!}
<A>__{they retreat, and porthos slams the second door. like all the inner doors of the bastille, it's heavy wood, a foot thick, and porthos seals it with a huger iron bar. but there's nowhere else to run.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{trapped.}
<A>__{at the far end of the corridor, the king's young musketeers have the same keys to the outer door that d'artagnan did, and they are breaking through. louis and two dozen of his personal bodyguard pour through the door.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{charge them!}
<A>__{the young musketeers obediently charge down the corridor. stepping up shoulder to shoulder aramis, d'artagnan, athos, porthos the four veteran musketeers meet the charge, first with pistols, then with swords, a wall between louis' men and phillippe. the battle in the cramped confines of the corridor is bloody and fierce; the young attackers can only get a few men into the fight at any one time, and those who step before the famous veterans are cut down. louis' young musketeers retreat, to regroup. at louis' end of the corridor louis is furious, jumping at lieutenant andre, who has dragged a wounded comrade back from the fight.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{cowards! twenty run from four?!}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{the corridor nullifies our number... and no one has stomach to fight the captain.}
<A>__{louis is disgusted by this loyalty and he has a solution.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{d'artagnan!}
<B>__{at the other end of the corridor}
<A>__{louis' voice echoes down to the veteran musketeers and phillippe, in the iron mask.}
<C>__{louis' voice}
<D>__{i am not angry with you. i knew you would lead me to them, and so you have! lay down your sword, and i will not punish you! i will let you retire in peace to live out your days in the countryside! and i will give your friends a swift execution, if you surrender now.}
<A>__{the words bounce down the long corridor; then silence. d'artagnan stands holding his sword, staring away from his friends, toward the king and his gang of young musketeers.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{d'artagnan. perhaps you should accept his offer, for we are dead anyway.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{he is right, d'artagnan.}
<A>__{athos says nothing; but when d'artagnan looks at him, he lowers his eyes in shame for ever having doubted d'artagnan's loyalty and friendship. phillippe speaks up, from behind the iron mask.}
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{wait. bargain me to louis, for all your lives. you have done your best. let me go, and let all of you find peace.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{no. even if i could give up my friends, i could never give up my son.}
<A>__{this hits them like a bombshell and suddenly it all makes sense; d'artagnan's loyalty to louis, his dogged hope that he could somehow influence him toward goodness. we see their stunned faces, each in turn: athos, aramis, porthos, and phillippe.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i never had any idea you existed... until they found you. and in all that time, i never had a moment's pride as a father until now.}
<A>__{d'artagnan and phillippe embrace, lost father to lost son. from the heavily barred door to their rear comes a powerful pounding; the bastille's soldiers are trying to break it down. time is running out. aramis looks back down the corridor toward the door to the outside, barred now by louis and his young guards, their long muskets bristling like spikes; and yet that way is the only possible hope for escape to the outside.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{d'artagnan... those are young musketeers down there. they have been weaned on our legends. they revere us it is an advantage. why don't we charge them?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i trained those men myself. they will stand and fight. but if we are to die, let it be this way.}
<A>__{he draws his sword and points it into the air. aramis lifts the tip of his sword to join that of d'artagnan. porthos does too... and then athos joins them.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{one for all. all for one.}
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{if i could have a blade, then i would be please to run with you.}
<A>__{d'artagnan gives phillippe a dagger. they look at each other. then d'artagnan begins to scream. the others take up the shout. then they step around the corner, and charge.}
<B>__{the last charge of the musketeers}
<A>__{we film it in all its glory, a visual feast: the last charge of the musketeers. their capes swirl about time, their hair flies, their legs take on new life. at first the young musketeers at the end of the corridor are frozen in surprise; their youthful lieutenant is awed by the dashing, beautiful bravery of the thing.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{magnificent valor...}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{shoot them! shoot them!}
<A>__{louis grabs a musket from one of the reluctant soldiers and fires: sssboom! with the first explosion of gunfire the others pull their triggers; the powder in their weapons flashes and crashes... the musket balls fly down the hallway, sparking off the stone walls and floor, ricocheting, punching holes through the capes and flesh... but still the musketeers charge like the young men they once were still are, in spirit. in the confines of the bastille's stone corridor the noise is deafening, and the space in front of the guards is filled with the dense gray smoke of the gunpowder. none of them can see anything beyond it... and all is quiet.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{draw blades!}
<A>__{the king's guards draw their swords, and wait; are all the old musketeers dead? slowly the figures emerge from the smoke in slow motion, walking now, no need to run. all are wounded, but all are still alive. the four musketeers, along with phillippe, move slowly and steadily toward the blades of the young guards; a fight to the death? so be it. but the young lieutenant will have none of it; as one of his men lifts a sword to plunge it into the chest of d'artagnan, the young lieutenant bats the sword down, with his own.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{stop!}
<A>__{he steps forward toward d'artagnan; but instead of thrusting his sword he salutes with it. his men follow suit, saluting and bowing to the courage of these men they have grown up wanting to follow. king louis, for the moment, is frozen. d'artagnan looks back at phillippe; he has bullet holes in two different places at the edges of his clothes, but he is unwounded. then d'artagnan sees louis, with his long dagger, leaping at phillippe.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{d'artagnan throws himself between the two twins and hurls louis backwards, then spins to phillippe.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{phillippe!}
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{i am unhurt }
<A>__{louis bounces off the wall and thrusts back again, driving the blade into d'artagnan's back. d'artagnan's face jolts; he staggers, his legs buckle. d'artagnan falls into the arms of his friends. louis stands holding his bloody dagger, everyone staring at him: d'artagnan, the old musketeers, the young ones.}
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{you! vicious... evil...!}
<A>__{he leaps into louis, overwhelming him in fury, wrenching the dagger from his brother's hand and gripping his throat.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{phillippe...! no... don't... he is your brother!}
<A>__{phillippe releases louis, who falls, choking, gasping. lieutenant andre is surprised by what he just heard.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{brother...?}
<A>__{phillippe darts to d'artagnan, being cradled by athos; athos lifts a hand from d'artagnan's back; it is drenched in blood. d'artagnan is dying. athos, aramis, porthos... none of them can speak. they grip d'artagnan, as if through their will alone they could keep his life from leaking away. the young musketeers stand transfixed, watching their legendary captain die. phillippe sags; his voice from behind the iron mask is torn by grief.}
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{all this time... i was a lost secret. but you were hiding all your loyalty, all your love. you were the man in the iron mask.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{d'artagnan...}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{shhh. all my life, this is the death i have wanted. to die among you. one for all... and all for...}
<A>__{he is gone. phillippe rises with a slow, terrible resolve, and moves to louis. when louis tries to rise to his feet he finds the blade of the young lieutenant andre pointed at his chest.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{all my life, all i ever wanted to be... was him.}
<A>__{he points to d'artagnan. phillippe rips away the key that dangles around louis' neck.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{at the other door}
<A>__{where the soldiers of the bastille's commander are finally breaking through; working the massive door aside they find the king with his guards, and aramis, athos, porthos, along with their prisoner, in the iron mask.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{we have recaptured the prisoner.}
<C>__{man in the iron mask}
<D>__{no, no! i am your }
<A>__{a blow in his chest from the lieutenant stuns the prisoner and drops him to his knees. the king orders the bastille governor }
<C>__{king}
<D>__{you will put this madman where no one can hear his insanity. let him be fed by a deaf mute. but feed him well, and let him have a long life within the iron mask.}
<C>__{bastille governor}
<D>__{and them?}
<A>__{he means aramis, porthos, and athos.}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{they are my loyal servants.}
<C>__{man in the iron mask}
<D>__{no! no...!}
<A>__{but the guards are dragging him to the deepest, darkest dungeon of the bastille.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior lane of elms beside the palace day}
<A>__{at the end of a lane of elms, where the markers of king's graves stand clustered, royal workmen place a mighty marble monument stone above the final resting place of d'artagnan. athos, aramis, porthos, and the king phillippe, known as king louis now stand gathered there, as aramis in his priest's garments utters the funeral incantations. aramis' voice breaks as he does so. porthos' eyes pour out rivers of tears. athos' grief is beyond weeping. phillippe holds the arm of his mother. she holds the rose d'artagnan left her.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{amen.}
<A>__{athos moves up between aramis and porthos, and links them with his arms.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{he was the best of us all.}
<A>__{aramis and porthos move off together, to walk the lane of elms; athos remains by the grave, unable to leave. phillippe pats anne's arm.}
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{i will be with you in a moment, mother.}
<A>__{she too moves down the lane of trees, touching the tip of the rose pedals to her lips as the tears run down her face. phillippe moves up to athos.}
<C>__{phillippe}
<D>__{after all you have done, i must ask you one more service to your king. i have lost my father. and you have lost your son. let me love you like a son to a father. and i pray you live for this, to love me like your son.}
<A>__{athos can't speak; he can only nod yes. phillippe moves to join his mother, leaving athos to take one final look down at the grave. then as athos moves off to join aramis and porthos, we pan from the name "d'artagnan" on the stone, to the pattern chiseled beneath the name. it is a mask, of iron.}
