<A>__{otis shoves denise into the coffin with jerry and locks the lid shut. through a cross shaped opening in the coffin we see them crushed together. rufus lowers the coffin into the pit. once the coffin is inside otis slams the door shut. otis opens a small window in the door and lowers in a lantern and a small tape recorder playing music.}
<L>__{interior pit night}
<A>__{enter hell. the dim light of the lantern shines off the slimy wet filth of the rotted wood walls. the stench of death and decay hangs heavy in the thin air. denise and jerry, cold and shivering, hang half submerged in thick maggot infested sludge. bits of animal and human skeletons float in the muck, broken bones lay in piles along the walls.}
