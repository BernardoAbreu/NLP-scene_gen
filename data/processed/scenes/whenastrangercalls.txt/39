<L>__{interior lt. garber's house night}
<A>__{all the lights are out inside the house, but we should just be able to see that we are in the hall, looking at the front door. footsteps approach on the walk outside. a key slips into the lock... inside the house we can hear faint whispering. someone is moving about in the darkness. then the door swings open and the shadowy figure of a man crosses the threshold. he stops just inside.}
<C>__{man}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{donna. donna! hey!}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{what the hell !}
<A>__{suddenly the lights come on and a chorus of voices cry out, "surprise!" a broad smile breaks across the man's face. we may recognize him as the cop from six years ago charles garber. today he is a lieutenant on the force and dresses casually for work, usually in slacks, turtleneck and jacket.}
<C>__{garber}
<P>__{(genuinely surprised)}
<D>__{what is all this?!}
<C>__{scattered voices}
<D>__{happy birthday, charlie!}
<A>__{garber looks sheepishly at his hand holding the pistol he'd drawn just before the lights came up.}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{look at him!}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{don't shoot us, charlie!}
<C>__{garber}
<P>__{(chagrined)}
<D>__{how was i supposed to know?}
<A>__{everybody starts to laugh, including garber as he returns the pistol to his shoulder holster.}
<B>__{angle on donna}
<A>__{garber's wife. she comes out of the kitchen carrying a birthday cake with lit candles and makes her way through the crowd of guests singing "happy birthday". everyone joins in as donna moves forward and stands beside her husband. clifford is one of the guests. he has his arm around a young blond who is sort of pretty despite her tacky plastic appearance. when the song is over, garber blows out the candles and hugs and kisses his wife. everybody cheers.}
