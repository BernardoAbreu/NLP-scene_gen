<L>__{exterior by the river night}
<A>__{by the light of the full moon, edward soaks his feet in the water, trying to make sense of it all. the key to the city dangles around his neck. he stares at himself in the reflection. he smiles. it's then that a woman emerges at the far side of the river. no telling where she came from she must have been swimming underwater. we never see her face. she stands in the river with her bare back to edward, squeezing the water out of her golden hair, oblivious to his presence. edward is breathless. it's the first woman he's seen in her natural state, and he doesn't dare move lest he frighten her away. then he sees the snake. it's a cottonmouth, has to be. it leaves a break in the water, its small reptilian head aiming for her flesh. there's no decision to be made. on pure instinct, edward dives in. he swims as hard as can,}
<B>__{grabbing the snake}
<A>__{just as it's about to strike. the woman dives back underwater, understandably terrified that a man is coming at her.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{no, it's okay! i got it. i got the snake.}
<A>__{as the splashing subsides, edward looks at what he holds in his hands. which isn't a snake at all, but rather a common stick. and a non threatening one at that. while edward ponders his mistake, he looks around to discover that the girl in the river is gone. he never even saw her face.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{wait! i'm sorry. hello?!}
<A>__{edward keeps expecting her to surface, somewhere, but she never does. he stands alone in the river, wondering what tricks his eyes are playing on him.}
