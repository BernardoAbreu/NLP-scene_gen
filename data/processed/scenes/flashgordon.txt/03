<L>__{interior plane in flight day}
<A>__{there are just two passengers in the cabin. one is dale arden, a great looking dark haired girl sitting by herself and reading a book entitled "karate for the single girl.... a guide to survival in the city." a few rows forward, near the open door into the pilots' compartment, is flash gordon. he's studying a football play sheet, one of those diagrammed things with x's and 0's for the players and dotted line arrows indicating the directions of movement. suddenly the plane makes a violent bump. it almost knocks the book from dale's hand. she looks out the window with sudden fright, tossing hair out of her eyes, in a gesture that's habitual to her in moments of stress. there's nothing to see outside but the pretty clouds. she looks forward again and watches flash standing up easily, leaning in t..e cockpit doorway to speak to the pilots.}
