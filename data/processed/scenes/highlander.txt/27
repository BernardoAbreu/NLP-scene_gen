<L>__{exterior georgetown street day}
<A>__{taupin steps out of a metro station and walks the few blocks to his brick townhouse. climbing the front stairs, he fishes his keys out of a coat pocket. about to insert the key he stops, sensing something. backing down the steps, taupin slips around to the rear of the building.}
<L>__{interior taupin home}
<A>__{like a spider taupin pries open a window and slips silently inside. the home is dark and still. taupin creeps down the hallway and peers into the entryway. there a man, dressed in a tuxedo jacket and nearly imperceptible in the dim light, is crouched at the front door. he is holding a sword. taupin removes a knife from his pocket and jumps the intruder. the two struggle fiercely. taupin pins the intruder against the carpet and shoves his knife firmly against the man's throat.}

<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{what name is he using?}

<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{he knows i'm here. how?}
<C>__{intruder}
<D>__{none of this would be happening if you hadn't run...}
<A>__{the knife is pressed deeper.}
<C>__{taupin}
