<L>__{interior sara's exeter house living room day}
<A>__{a pair of flexing feet in ballet slippers on a hardwood floor. pan up and pull back to reveal sara at 17, dancing in the space opened up by cornered furniture and rolled up rugs. as glynn looks on, sara completes the routine with a pirouette. she spins out of it with a preoccupied frown on her face.}
<C>__{glynn}
<D>__{what's the matter? it was good.}
<C>__{sara}
<P>__{(checks her stance in mirror)}
<D>__{everybody there's going to be good, mom. i have to be better.}
<P>__{(then, beginning again)}
<D>__{my knees still knock when i do my free form. did you notice that?}
<C>__{glynn}
<D>__{i noticed that it was fine.}
<C>__{sara}
<P>__{(escalating frustration)}
<D>__{it's not supposed to be fine. it's supposed to be special.}
<C>__{sara }
<D>__{and it just lays there, it doesn't do anything. i bet they notice that. that it doesn't do anything. that i don't do anything special enough to get in.}
<C>__{glynn}
<D>__{sara. you'll get in.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{don't lie because you love me. my free form sucks.}
<C>__{glynn}
<P>__{(giving up that battle)}
<D>__{i've got something for you. come on. sit. mouth closed, eyes shut. no pouting. no peeking.}
<A>__{sara flops down on the sofa beside her. closes her eyes. glynn removes the clover chain from her neck, fastens it around sara's.}
<C>__{glynn}
<D>__{for luck tomorrow. not that you'll need it. you dance like an angel.}
<A>__{the necklace is glynn's talisman. sara knows what it means to her. she throws her arms around glynn, holds onto her tightly.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i love the necklace but you're still the best luck i will ever have.}
<A>__{glynn, not one to choke up, chokes up. they cling to each other.}
