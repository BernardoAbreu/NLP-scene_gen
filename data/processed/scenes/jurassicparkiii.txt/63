<L>__{interior dino kennel continuous day}
<A>__{the group slams the door behind them and quickly takes in the room. there are several rows of oversized steel cages, apparently used for containing young dinosaurs. many of the cage doors are standing open. the group races down a lone aisle. close behind, the raptor bursts into the room, roars. as the raptor gains ground, udesky and billy run into one of the open cages, slamming the door behind them. grant, paul and amanda duck into another. before they can swing the cage door shut behind them, however, the raptor slams into it, driving the door into the cage. they are forced back against a chain like wall, trapped in a small triangle space by the advancing door. the angry raptor is now inches away through the cage door. then, suddenly, the raptor looks up. we follow its gaze. the top of their triangular enclose is wide open. the eager raptor climbs up the chain like door. catching the tail of an idea, amanda grabs the door and nods to the others.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{push!}
<A>__{they push hard on the cage door, swinging it and the raptor right through the opening of the cage. now the raptor is trapped in a small triangular space, the door going right to the ceiling. amanda slides the door's bolt through the chain like wall, temporarily trapping the dinosaur. the raptor struggles desperately, grawling and snarling, but the cage door seems to be holding. as everyone rushes back to the door. the raptor begins to make a low, haunting moan. as the others head for the door, grant lingers a step, listening to the beast's simple melodic cry. it has the same tones as came from the model resonating chamber.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{she's calling for help.}
