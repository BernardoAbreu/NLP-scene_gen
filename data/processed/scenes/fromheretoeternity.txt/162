<L>__{exterior highway adjoining golf course night}
<A>__{moving shot jeep with three mps the night is inky black except for a little moonlight and the dimmed headlights of the jeep. camera shoots past driver onto the highway as the jeep moves slowly along. the two other mps clutch thompson guns, try to scan the dark countryside.}
<C>__{first mp}
<D>__{they say they seen parachutists land up in the mountains.}
<C>__{second mp}
<D>__{i ain't worried about them. sabatoors is what worries me.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{yeah. theys the creepy ones. walkin around just like ordinary civilians. i betcha they operatin all over these islands.}
<B>__{long shot shooting from side of highway}
<A>__{the headlights pass along the road as the jeep moves on out of sight. as its sound fades we hear prew's heavy breathing, are barely able to distinguish his figure in the darkness. he is crouched, watching the car go down the highway. we hear his thoughts. the voice is labored and agonized.}
<C>__{prew's voice }
<D>__{... almost home... ony across the golf course... now... now... no... wait... gotta be care?... gotta sweat it out...}
<A>__{he groans, puts his hand to his side. in the feeble light from the moon we see blood on his shirt and hand. he looks up and down the road.}
<C>__{prew's voice }
<D>__{... it's clear now... gotta get home...}
<A>__{still crouched, prew starts across the road.}
<B>__{long shot opposite side of road}
<A>__{we see nothing but the strip of road, then prew+s figure is visible, bent low, weaving a little. as he approaches the camera, he is taught square in the twin beams of dimmed headlights which flash on from the side of the road. now we see that a jeep is parked near camera, heading in the opposite direction from the jeep which passed before. it is also manned by three mps. there is a startled cry from prew.}
<C>__{mp's voice}
<D>__{halt!}
<A>__{prew starts to run back across the road. a white spotlight flashes on, its harsh brilliant light following him. prew slips to one knee.}
<B>__{close shot prew}
<A>__{looking toward the jeep, blinded by the blazing light. he has the appearance of a terrified animal. there is a wildness, a senselessness about him. the blotch of blood oozes and spreads over his shirt. he picks up a rock from the road.}
<B>__{medium shot}
<A>__{prew rises, staggers away from the jeep.}
<C>__{mp's voice}
<D>__{halt!}
<A>__{prew flings the rock desperately toward the lights. there is a crash of glass and one headlight winks off. prew runs across the road and onto the golf course.}
<B>__{medium shot jeep}
<A>__{the motor starts, the jeep moves out from its hiding place and starts across the golf course.}
<B>__{moving shot shooting from jeep}
<A>__{prew, in a skirmisher's zigzag, is trying to elude the spotlight. he is about twenty yards in front of the jeep. he heads for a high sandtrap. the spot is full on him as he reaches the lip of the trap. he turns, yells something back at the jeep. it is barely heard over the sound of the jeep.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{ i'm a soljer! }
<C>__{mp}
<D>__{that guy ain't no soljer he dint halt }
<B>__{medium shot prew}
<A>__{standing on the lip of the trap, the jeep bearing down on him. he turns, starts to dive into the trap. a blast of gunfire from the jeep hits him. he falls sideways into the trap, rolls over on his back, the jeep moves into the shot, crawls half way over the trap, stops, its spotlight pouring down on prew. his eyes are open, looking up to the sky.}
<C>__{another angle}
<A>__{camera shoots down to prew from top of trap. a portion of the jeep is in shot, but we are not able to see the mps.}
<C>__{mp's voice}
<P>__{(quavering, almost tearful)}
<C>__{mp's voice}
<D>__{ maybe he was a soljer i dint mean to kill him i dint mean it, guys you know we got orders }
<C>__{second mp's voice}
<D>__{shut up.}
<A>__{the voices are lost as camera moves slowly down toward prew's open eyes. we hear his thoughts on the sound track, clear and fast at first and slow and almost inaudible as the camera}
<B>__{reaches a full head closeup.}
<C>__{prew's voice}
<D>__{... sweat it out and sweat it out and wait and wait and wait for it... and now it's here... it's here... gotta see to do it well... gotta do it well... won't take long...}
<A>__{camera moves closer to closeup of prew's open eyes.}
<C>__{prew's voice}
<D>__{... just a little more now... gotta do it good... it'll be over... nobody lies... lonely... a man has... got to have some place...}
<A>__{prew's eyes close. the screen goes black.}
