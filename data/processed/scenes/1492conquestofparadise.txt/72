<A>__{they stand on the beach, almost in a dream. there is silence. the royal notary, ludicrously overdressed, now wet through, stumbles over to columbus and holds out his contract and a pen. columbus scrawls his name. the men stare at him, filled not only with new respect, but with something amounting to awe. columbus turns to them, tries to speak.}

<C>__{columbus}
<P>__{(pulling himself together)}
<D>__{in the name of their gracious majesties of castille and aragon, and by all the powers vested in me, i claim this island and name it san salvador.}
<A>__{the men cheer as the flags are rammed into the sand, flapping in the wind. columbus starts to walk towards the jungle, and in silence the rest follow.}
