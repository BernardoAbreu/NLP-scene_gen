<A>__{rambo emerges into the stifling humid heat of bangkok in may and stands, scanning for a cab.}
<D>__{d minus 51 hrs bangkok, thailand}
<A>__{bangkok is a city of fervid motion and the street is chaotic with traffic. stepping through throngs of asians and tourists rambo reaches for the door of a beat to hell citroen taxi hunkered low at the curb like some metal lungfish. he spins as a hand lightly touches his shoulder.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{sorry old buddy, i saw it first.}
<A>__{an american in his late twenties, the man speaks with one of those hard to dislike southern accents. probably north carolina. he is lanky but muscular, with boyish good looks and hair cut so short it barely qualifies as stubble. though dressed in a loud hawaiian shirt and madras slacks, it is painfully obvious the man is military. his arm is draped around a gorgeous but overly made up thai girl.}

<D>__{i kinda got an important date.}
<A>__{rambo's eyes narrow as he turns wordlessly and climbs into the taxi. the american grins cockily and tosses his bag to rambo.}
