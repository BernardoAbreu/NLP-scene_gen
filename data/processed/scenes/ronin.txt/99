<T>__{a quick cut to:}
<B>__{inside the farmhouse}
<A>__{where vincent has just poured himself a cup of coffee and lit a very satisfying cigarette when he hears the voices from outside.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{vincent doesn't owe me a thing.}
<A>__{vincent looks up when he hears his name and he moves towards the sound of the voices.}
<P>__{jean pierre (o.s.)}
<D>__{he sees this differently, as you well know.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{i didn't expect that he would.}
<A>__{back on the porch }
<D>__{jean pierre you suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{vincent told you that i'm a cop? jean pierre not a word. but no ordinary criminal would have the extensive military and medical expertise you do. and so i place the pieces of the puzzle together in a way that makes sense to me. you work for some government agency and you carry a gun, and in my world, that makes you a cop.}
<A>__{and now jean pierre produces a long barreled revolver which he places loosely in his lap a gesture which seems to say, "you'd better explain things to my satifaction or we're gonna have a problem." sam notices the weapon, but he doesn't react overtly.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{so this is what, a test? jean pierre call it a reckoning of character.}
<A>__{beat. sam looks at the revolver again.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{if i was healthy, i could take that away from you. jean pierre perhaps. but you are not healthy, and if you try i will kill you.}
