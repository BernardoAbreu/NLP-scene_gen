<T>__{back to scene:}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{you, mister, are crazy making..i can't take this calm thing you've}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{started doing. it's like this is your way of letting me know there's something deeply wrong with me because i'm not calm.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{let's not go all over the place..can't we...}
<C>__{deborah}
<P>__{(shouted burst)}
<D>__{if you're going to talk to me please have the decency to raise your voice.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(a beat then sudden}
<D>__{urgency and change of}
<P>__{tone)}
<D>__{let's make a break for it.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<A>__{he signals her with his eyes and head and then takes a large but tentative step away from the spot where he was standing...then additional faster steps. he gestures with enormous energy for her to follow him to his new spot in the room. she eyes him suspiciously.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{just for a second.}
<A>__{she walks to him...he puts an arm around her shoulder. and gestures back to where they were standing. he talks in an almost hushed, conspiratorial voice.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{we don't have to be those people. nobody's watching. they've been masquerading as us for a while here..i will distract them you make a break for it and i will meet you outside.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{you're ridiculing me because i care about this.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(firmly)}
<D>__{no. i'm not. i mean this..let's get away from those two in case they're as miserable as they look..}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(urging..like a southern coach)}
<D>__{come on, baby.}
<A>__{he is looking at her with wit and conviction..trying to squirt lighter fluid at the flame of their love. deborah looks up at him..intimacy of a different sort.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{let me ask you a question..let me change the subject..forget for a moment that you won't support me with georgie..}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(reasonably)}
<D>__{well, i don't think...}
<A>__{she makes a noise of frustration to stop him..it works. john is rendered still and intimidated by her conduct but he is "man" enough for his jaw to set...to pause for a beat as he looks her straight in the eye..and walks back to the spot they occupied previously.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{go ahead.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{here's the question. it's been on my mind more and more. do you do that calm thing for the purpose of infuriating me?}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(genuinely puzzled)}
<D>__{what? why would ...}
<P>__{(on her exasperated look)}
<D>__{why would anyone do something to someone they love for the purpose of messing them up?}
<C>__{deborah}
<P>__{(unconvinced distant)}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{he hates that look of isolation on her face..he needs to make her feel better.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{deb, since high school we've been able to read each other...take advantage of it..the answer to the question is,"absolutely not." now take a look and tell me if you believe me.}
<A>__{she looks at him..with a finger motion he directs her gaze to his eyes.. close on john's eyes. open, smiling, trusting. trying to get a laugh out of her. close on deborah's eyes. studying, questioning, probing, doubting, exhausted...}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{i don't.. believe you. i think you just want me to feel badly about myself..sorry, honey.}
