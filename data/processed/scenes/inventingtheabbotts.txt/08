<A>__{the curb is lined with parked cars. we hear a dance band playing "que sera" and the sounds of the party as doug lopes up the sidewalk sporting his india ink sideburns and smoking a cigarette. he flicks the cigarette into the street with well rehearsed ease as he turns and walks up the long driveway towards the glowing "big top" tent. doug trails his hand over lloyd abbott's cadillac, caressing it from hood to trunk as he ambles by.}
