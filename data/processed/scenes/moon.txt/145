<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{i e. rover one moon surface day sam 1 speeding along in one of the rovers. he wears his space suit and resembles a cosmic racing driver shifts up a gear, the vehicle flirting with peak speed. he flies past one of the harvesters, speaks through a microphone inside his helmet.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{just passing the last of the harvesters looks like john }
<A>__{all of this against the roar of the rover's engine. i e. rover two moon surface driving away from base in a different direction, sam 2. he also wears a space suit. he also guns the engine. he also has a microphone inside his helmet. the two clones are able to talk back and forth with no delay.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{how long until you're out of the base's range?}
<A>__{we intercut : between the two sams in their rovers.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{if i maintain this speed...a minute. ninety seconds tops.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{you ever been this far out?}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{no, never.}
<A>__{another angle second rover viewed from far away, the rover's speed less impressive from a distance. i e. rover's one and two moon surface intercut as the sams continue to drive.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{you see anything yet?}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{nothing. you?}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{there isn't shit out here...i feel like i'm about to drive off the end of the world.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{it would help if i knew what i was looking for.}
<A>__{through the glass of sam 1's helmet we see his face suddenly shift.}
<C>__{sam 1 }
<D>__{wait a second, wait a second.}
<A>__{sam 1 squints and leans closer towards the windshield, like he's trying to decipher a road sign }
<C>__{sam 1 }
<D>__{i see something.}
<A>__{sam 1's pov about a hundred feet away appearing from thin air a massive metal pole stretches up into the black sky.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{don't know yet.}
<A>__{sam 1 getting closer.}
<C>__{sam 1 }
<D>__{looks like some kind of antenna.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{antenna? really?}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{hang on, looks like there's one on this side too.}
<A>__{sam 2 is indeed approaching something similar. sam 1 stops his rover about twenty feet from the jammer. he opens the rover's door and steps out to take a closer look. wide shot sam 1 rover taking in the jammer and the adjacent rover. sam 1 loping towards the jammer, seemingly in slow motion. the jammer is gigantic an intimidating, stark pole stabbed into the lunar landscape, like the worlds biggest caber. next to it sam 1 is tiny, a white dot, as insignificant as a pin prick. sam 1 and sam 2 we cut back and forth between the two sams as they both investigate the separate but identical looking jammers.}
<C>__{sam 2 }
<D>__{i can just make out the top. must be a hundred feet tall at least. it's huge!}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{whoever built these things meant business. they weren't fucking around.}
<A>__{their voices energized they are excited to have made this discovery they aren't dealing with the negatives yet.}
<C>__{sam 1 }
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{its not an antennae, dude. its a jammer.}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{no wonder we can't get a live feed. these things must be blocking our signal.}
<A>__{suddenly sam 1 doubles over. he vomits thick, viscous blood and sick into his helmet. revolting. the noise is audible over the microphone.}
<C>__{sam 2 }
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{no answer from sam 1. he collapses backwards onto the ground. his chest lurches like he's been punched at from the inside he spins over onto his front }
<C>__{sam 2 }
<D>__{sam?}
<A>__{sam 1 manages to climb to his feet heads slowly back to the rover he dips in, closes the door.}
<C>__{sam 2 }
<D>__{sam, can you hear me?}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{yeah, i hear you.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{i'm going to head back to base. i'm not feeling too good.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{i will stay out here a little longer. i want to see if there are any more of these things.}
<A>__{sam 1 pulls a u turn and begins his journey back to base. sam 2 remains out by his jammer, investigating further.}
