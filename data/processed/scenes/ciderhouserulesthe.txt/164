<A>__{homer and candy sit and stare at the blank screen; they don't look at each other. candy grips the steering wheel of the parked car.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{please don't make me say it again.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{no, that's not it i just want to be sure i understand you.}
<A>__{candy slumps forward with her forehead on the steering wheel.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{i helped you not to think about wally. you were so upset you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. this is how i helped you, right?}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{please... that's enough. i loved you, too you know i did.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{"...did." well, okay.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{please don't...}
<C>__{homer}
<P>__{(sarcastically)}
<D>__{and now that wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly need you...}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{you say that as though it's some awful thing!}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{i never stopped loving wally!}
<A>__{homer lets that sink in.}
<C>__{homer}
<P>__{(still sarcastic)}
<D>__{at least there's no more waiting and seeing. at least i got to see the ocean.}
<A>__{candy covers her face in her hands and cries uncontrollably, unstoppably. homer's anger keeps him impervious to her tears another "first" for him. he turns and looks at her with an almost clinical curiosity; then he goes back to staring at the blank screen.}
