<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{in a courtyard of the midwife's house, sandro and claudia are questioning a middle aged woman.}
<C>__{midwife}
<D>__{i only exchanged a few casual words with her, as one would ordinarily do on a public bus...}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{and do you remember where she got off?}
<C>__{midwife}
<D>__{well...probably at the last stop, which is noto.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{after that, you didn't see her anymore?}
<A>__{the woman pauses for a few seconds and looks at claudia as though she had detected some hidden motive behind the question. and when she resumes speaking, what she has to say is in sharp contrast to the way she says it. they are words of protest but spoken condescendingly, almost sweetly, yet leaving no doubt as to their meaning.}
<C>__{midwife}
<D>__{what are you trying to insinuate, young lady? why should i have seen her again? i don't do anything that's illegitimate.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{oh, no... what are you saying? i'm not insinuating anything...}
<C>__{midwife}
<D>__{and furthermore, my dear young lady... because you really are a dear, you know ...if the story of that girl is merely a pretext, let us say, to get in touch with her, then i feel it is my duty to warn her. these things are very, very dangerous, especially in a neighborhood like this where people occupy themselves more with other people's affairs than their own.}
<A>__{seeing claudia being put into an uncomfortable position, sandro, who had been following the midwife's discussion with a cagey attitude, intervenes.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{then you should also be able to tell me where a young girl might stay in noto; are there any hotels or rooming houses?}
<C>__{midwife}
<D>__{there's the trinacria hotel... or the regina, near the municipal building. as for rooming houses, i don't know...}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{midwife}
<D>__{don't mention it... pleased to be of service any time.}
<A>__{claudia starts moving hurriedly out of the courtyard, followed by sandro.}
