<A>__{a sprawling old ranch house tucked into the remote hills of the desert. a guy passes out in the front yard. a dog sniffs at him, then starts pissing on him. he never moves. a pile of dead pigeons near the driveway. close on pooh bear he does indeed have a prosthetic nose. it almost blends in with his face but not quite, making it that much more disconcerting. he takes a huge hit of crystal meth from a pipe, holds it, then blows a long exhale.}
