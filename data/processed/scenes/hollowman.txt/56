<A>__{the laboratory door opens and shuts again. ghostly. we see papers shuffling at one of the work stations. a glass moves slightly.}
<L>__{interior observation room night}
<A>__{sarah reclines in her chair. fast asleep, behind her is the glass wall, revealing the empty hallway behind it. but a small portion of the glass fogs, as if someone had just breathed on it. as the fogged part quickly clears, we see the door to the observation room quietly open. on sarah, still sleeping. we hear a whisper.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{sarah. are you awake?}
<A>__{her heavy breathing mixes with sebastian's.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice }
<P>__{(barely audible)}
<D>__{hmm.}
<A>__{sarah's hair moves slightly, as if a hand were running through it. and then we see her shirt move, like fingers were tracing over it. down from the shoulder to her breast. around her nipple. sarah moans slightly, as if she were dreaming, but she doesn't stir. and then her breasts cup slightly, as if they were being touched... softly... gently. her breathing becomes harder, more labored, erotic... and then she... bolts awake. bar eyes wide with fear. she jumps and cups her own breasts and looks around the room. it's empty, of course. she jumps over to the monitor and checks on sebastian's room. the heat signature isn't there.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{dr. caine! goddamnit, dr. caine! are you in here?}
<A>__{she listens. it's silent. she tries holding her breath, listening for his breathing. but there's nothing. sarah reaches over to a microphone. hits a few switches.}
<C>__{sarah }
<D>__{dr. caine?}
<B>__{various shots of the compound}
