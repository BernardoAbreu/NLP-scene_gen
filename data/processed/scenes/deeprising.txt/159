<L>__{exterior sublevel lobby day}
<A>__{the doors blow out into the darkened hallway. for a long moment nothing moves, then finnegan tumbles out of the elevator. rising painfully. one after another the others exit into the dark lobby.}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{where are we?}
<C>__{canton}
<D>__{the sublevel lobby.}
<A>__{finnegan bends down to pick up one of the pulse rifles.}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{don't touch it!}
<A>__{finnegan looks up to hanover standing a bit shakily, his own rifle trained on finnegan.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{you shoot me and you got no ride home...}
<A>__{and with that, finnegan picks up the gun. a test of wills. finnegan wins, and then turns to the captain.}
<C>__{finnegan }
<D>__{you the captain?}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{how do we get out of here?}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{we have to make it to the third deck...}
<A>__{pantucci steps on something. crunch! he looks down, his eyes widen.}
<C>__{pantucci}
<D>__{oh no!! oh no!! finnegan!!!}
<A>__{he starts dancing around, trying not to step on whatever it is. trillian looks down and screams. everybody freaks finnegan grabs a flashlight from chin's utility belt, and sweeps the beam over the lobby. the entire floor of the lobby is littered with shattered human skeletons. picked clean and spit out. just like the earlier whale bones. then suddenly, at the far end of the hallway, one of the metal walls suddenly expands and flexes. everybody feezes. and then the flexing suddenly comes racing down either side of the hallway, accompanied by the most god awful primordial screech!}
<C>__{finnegan}
<D>__{this way!}
<A>__{finnegan bolts. everybody else right behind him. the flexing and screeching vanishes into the walls.}
