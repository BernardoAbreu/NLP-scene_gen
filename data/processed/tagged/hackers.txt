<L>__{exterior front yard. day.}
<A>__{slow motion. armed troops in black uniforms pour out of unmarked vans and swarm across a lawn in a middle class residential neighborhood. yuppie neighbours look on in shock, confused. two of the troops carry a battering ram to the front door of a white two storey house. a leashed rottweiler snarls and barks. in position, their comrades point m 16s into first floor windows, ready to be ambushed. pan into a window in the kitchen. an attractive woman in her thirties is making breakfast. now, in regular motion, the battering ram breaks open the front door. the woman, startled, drops her spatula.}

<C>__{woman}
<D>__{what's going on? what's the matter? who are you?}
<A>__{the troops, and one or two trenchcoated agents, continue entering the house and heading upstairs, still with rifles ready.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{upstairs, crowded in the narrow hallway, the troops descend on a bedroom.}

<A>__{the prosecutor, a woman of about forty, gives her closing argument blandly. she'd rather be somewhere else.}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{the defendant, dade murphy, who calls himself "zero cool", has repeatedly committed criminal acts of a malicious nature. this defendant possesses a superior intelligence, which he uses to a destructive and antisocial end. his computer virus crashed one thousand five hundred and seven computer systems, including wall street trading systems, single handedly causing a seven point drop in the new york stock market.}
<A>__{as she speaks, the camera pans across the court, panning down and stopping on the defendant: eleven year old dade murphy. fast forward to the sentencing.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{dade murphy, i hereby fine your family forty five thousand dollars...}
<A>__{the court gasps, dade's father winces}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{...and sentence you to probation, under which you are forbidden to own or operate a computer or touch tone telephone, until the day of your eighteenth birthday.}
<A>__{now dade winces, in fact we almost expect him to cry. opening credits roll to a backdrop of dade and his family and lawyer fighting through a gaggle of journalists and photographers, in slow motion, and driving away.}
<B>__{seven years later.}
<A>__{aboard a jetliner, dade murphy is staring blankly out the window, wearing headphones. exterior view from the aircraft of approaching new york city. the view becomes a direct overhead of the buildings and streets of the city, which then metamorphoses (through animation) into chips and digital signals on a stylised computer board. the title logo.}

<A>__{dade goes to work on otv. he closes his eyes and a flurry of half second video clips from old tv shows flashes by. he opens his eyes. his screen says entering arps 331 and then wipes to another screen. automated record playback system. there is a graphic representation of the station's automatic videotape changer. dade turns on his tv set and turns to otv. it is running a rush limbaugh type tv show.}
<C>__{commentator}
<P>__{(on tv)}
<D>__{...so called american indians, latinos and blacks come from a genetically mediocre stock...}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{yak yak yak. get a job!}
<A>__{dade presses a key on his keyboard. the video changer diagram lights up in red. at the station, a robotic arm selects a videotape from a huge rack of thousands of tapes. the "america first" tape slides out of the vtr and is replaced by an episode of "the outer limits" as dade watches, drinks coke and smiles, full of himself.}
<C>__{tv}
<D>__{you are about to experience the awe and mystery, which reaches from the inner mind, to... the outer limits.}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{yesssss!}
<A>__{suddenly, the arps screen is replaced by an ominous message:}
<B>__{u have tread}
<A>__{upon my domain &}
<B>__{must now suffer}
<A>__{who r u?}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{hey! what?}

<A>__{who wants to know? dade's screen dissolves into:}
<B>__{acid burn}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{unbelievable. a hacker!}
<A>__{then the screen changes again:}
<B>__{acid burn}
<A>__{sez leave b 4}
<B>__{u r expunged}
<A>__{"the outer limits" suddenly flashes off.}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{yeah, okay "acid burn", that's enough.}
<A>__{dade starts hacking. apparently so does acid burn. the tape changer machines at otv are swamped, sometimes fighting over the same tape. the program on tv keeps changing. the message comes up on dade's computer screen:}
<B>__{i will swat u like the fly u r}
<A>__{more dueling tape changers, more half second video clips. another message.}
<B>__{i will snap your back like a toothpick}
<A>__{as the duel continues, dade types back a taunt of his own:}
<B>__{mess with the best die like the rest}
<A>__{one last from acid burn:}
<B>__{you are terminated}
<A>__{then his own computer confirms for him that the connection is terminated.}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{shit on me!}
<A>__{next morning. mrs. murphy is unpacking. dade emerges from his room in a housecoat. he makes a beeline (dodging moving boxes) for the fridge.}
<C>__{mrs. murphy}
<D>__{good morning. you unpack your stuff yet?}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{mm hmm.}
<C>__{mrs. murphy}
<D>__{up all night again, huh?}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{can this wait until both my eyes are open, please?}
<A>__{dade's mom picks up the phone, mocking a call to the building superintendent.}
<C>__{mrs. murphy}
<D>__{can i cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? he's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{well yes, he could be playing with himself. mmm hmm. yes i will ask. dade, you like girls, don't you?}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{well, yeah, i just haven't found one as charming as you yet.}
<C>__{mrs. murphy}
<D>__{you haven't been doing anything stupid, right, dade?}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{right, dade?!}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{right, mom. and i'm still a virgin!}
<A>__{dade slams the bathroom door. mrs. murphy quickly checks his room. dade is showering.}
<C>__{mrs. murphy}
<P>__{(angry, through the bathroom door)}
<D>__{you hooked it up to the phone, didn't you? dade! turn the shower off! you screw up again and you won't get into college!}
<A>__{she pauses and regains some of her cool.}
<C>__{mrs. murphy}
<D>__{i'm sorry we had to move in your senior year. i didn't want to sell the house but i had to take this new job, you know that. you're going to love new york, it's the city that never sleeps!}
<L>__{exterior new york city.}
<A>__{we enjoy several views of new york, the morning sun shining between skyscrapers, neon signs that stay lit day and night. dade emerges from the ground floor apartment on rollerblades and skates down the street to school.}
<L>__{interior high school.}
<A>__{at school, hundreds of teenagers converse, move around, head to class. dade looks lost among them. he walks up to a skinny latino kid in a faux leopard skin muscle shirt. the kid is on a pay phone, speaking in spanish.}

<C>__{kid}
<D>__{yo, chill man, i'm talking to venezuela.}

<A>__{now dade really looks lost. he heads off in search of the office.}
<L>__{interior office.}
<A>__{dade is filling out a form.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{do you have your transfer forms?}
<A>__{dade stares at her, stunned. the girl has a decidedly unconventional appearance, yet is a first rate beauty.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{it's a relatively straightforward question.}
<A>__{dade notices her lips, and in his imagination launches into a flurry of half second video clips and art bites, all involving lips and kissing.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{do you speak english?}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{sorry, you wanted...?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{i wanted transfer forms.}

<C>__{dade}
<D>__{thanks!}
<L>__{exterior school rooftop.}
<A>__{dade enters, and lets the door slam behind him. across the roof, a dozen or so geeky looking kids are looking over the edge, apparently trying to get someone's attention. one of them notices dade.}
<C>__{geek}
<D>__{hey! hold the door!}
<A>__{he's too late. the geeks look pretty angry. there is no pool.}
<D>__{dade}

<L>__{interior school corridor.}
<A>__{dade is soaking wet, and trudges among his classmates leaving a muddy trail. a three second video clip rolls through his mind: it is a screaming woman being strangled in an old movie. he walks past kate, who giggles.}

<D>__{oh my god! he found the pool.}
<L>__{interior school computer lab.}
<A>__{the kids are all seated at computer workstations. dade is hacking, the latino kid who was on the phone to venezuela is running a demo involving dirty dancing skeletons.}

<A>__{dade wheels into cyberdelia, which just happens to be equipped with a ramp down to its main floor for the benefit of skaters. the place pounds with loud, bassy techno music and coloured light. video monitors with psychedelic patterns complete the atmopshere. there is a video game with a huge screen. phreak is at a pay phone.}

<P>__{(amused and highly impressed)}
<A>__{oh my god. you... a bell rings and students pour out into the halls by the hundreds. they're all being showered on. a tall cheerleader bounces by phreak, pushing her pom pom in his face.}

<A>__{razor and blade busily work on keeping him on the air.}
<C>__{cereal}
<D>__{but for what, you ask? world domination? nay. something far more tacky. a virus called da vinci, that when launched, would cause ellingson mineral tankers to capsize was to be blamed on innocent hackers. but this virus was really the smokescreen, right. what could be so vitally important to protect that someone would create such a nasty, antisocial, very uncool virus program?}
<A>__{cereal is now seen and heard on the big screen in times square.}
<C>__{cereal}
<D>__{but why? could it be to cover the tracks for this worm program? a worm that was to steal 25 million bucks. the password for this hungry little sucker belongs to margo wallace, head of public relations at ellingson mineral...}
