<ACTION>__{The frame is filled with the face of PETER SULLIVAN, a 27- year-old risk assessment analyst. He has a Doctorate from MIT and is staring intently into a large bank of computer screens. An elevator door opens and FOUR HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE come out of the elevator carrying large file boxes. They walk down a long glass enclosed hallway that runs the full length of the trading floor. The scope of the floor now comes into frame. There are more computers than can be imagined and several large boards on the far walls that are scrolling thousands of numbers. PETER gives a knowing glance to the guy sitting next to him, SETH BREGMAN, a young analyst in his early twenties.}

PETER puts on his headphones and very loud RAP MUSIC drowns out all other noise and PETER tries to get lost back into the numbers on his computer screen. The sequence follows the HR people walking around and firing people intercut with PETER just staring at his computer screen. It runs for almost the length of the song until finally the same woman comes walking back down the hall and stops behind PETER and taps him on the shoulder. He takes off his headphones and the MUSIC STOPS. He is shell-shocked.}

<ACTION>__{They come through glass doors and enter a massive conference room with a commanding view of the city. It is filled with people along one side of the table. There are a team of five lawyers, three compliance officers, a couple of key board members, twelve in all. On the near side of the table sits RAMESH SHAH surrounded by empty chairs all alone. The head of the table is empty. They all file in and sit down. They all sit in silence... waiting. Finally from a side door JOHN TULD comes walking into the room. He is dressed in a average suit and tie, is not tall, late fifties and doesn't have a hair on his head. He carries himself without much exception. His eyes however tell a far different tale. Intense even at rest. He walks the length of the room, everyone half stands up.}

<DIAL>__{So Mr. Sullivan why don't you tell me what you think is going on here, and please speak as you might to a young child or a golden retriever, I didn't get here on my brains I can assure you of that.}
<ACTION>__{PETER is very nervous.}
<CHAR>__{PETER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, sir. As I guess you may or may not know I work for Mr. Rogers here as an associate in the risk assessment and management office at MBS}
<CHAR>__{JOHN TULD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Now you lost me at M...}
<CHAR>__{PETER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sorry...}
<CHAR>__{JOHN TULD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I was joking Mr. Sullivan.}
<CHAR>__{PETER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes... Well as you probably know over the last 36-40 months the firm has begun packaging new MBS products that combine several different traunches of rating classification in one tradable security. This has been very profitable as I imagine you noticed.}
<CHAR>__{JOHN TULD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I have.}
<CHAR>__{PETER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well the firm is currently doing a considerable amount of this business every day. The problem, which is I guess why we are here tonight, is that it takes us... the firm... almost a month to layer these products correctly thereby posing a challenge from a risk management standpoint.}
<CHAR>__{JOHN TULD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And Mr. Sullivan that challenge is?}
<CHAR>__{PETER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We have to hold these assets on our books longer than we might ideally like to.}
<CHAR>__{JOHN TULD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes.}
<CHAR>__{PETER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But the key factor is these are essentially just mortgages, so that has allowed us to push the leverage considerably beyond what you might be willing, or allowed to do in any other circumstance, thereby pushing the risk profile without raising any red flags.}
<CHAR>__{JOHN TULD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And how far have we pushed that profile tonight Mr. Sullivan?}
<CHAR>__{PETER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We have pushed it to 1.215 Trillion dollars... at MBS alone.}
<CHAR>__{JOHN TULD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Give or take.}
<CHAR>__{PETER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Give or take.}
<CHAR>__{JOHN TULD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Now Mr. Sullivan what I am guessing, and give me a little rope here, what I am guessing that your report here says is that considering the, shall we say bumpy road, we've been on the last week or so that the numbers that your brilliant co- workers up the line ahead of you had come up with in the past don't seem to make much sense anymore considering what's taking place today?}
<CHAR>__{PETER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Actually not taking place today but what's already taken place over the last two weeks.}
<CHAR>__{JOHN TULD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{So what you're saying is it's already happened?}
<CHAR>__{PETER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sort of.}
<CHAR>__{JOHN TULD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And Mr. Sullivan what does your model say that means for us here?}
<CHAR>__{PETER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, that's where it becomes a projection. But...}
<ACTION>__{PETER looks down at JARED for approval to go forward.}
<CHAR>__{JOHN TULD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're speaking with me Mr. Sullivan.}
<CHAR>__{PETER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well... sir... if those assets were to decrease by just 25 percent, and remain on our books... well... that loss would be greater than the current market capitalization of this company.}
<ACTION>__{The room goes silent. JOHN TULD looks at PETER long and hard. He then stands up and goes over to the window and looks into the city.}
<CHAR>__{JOHN TULD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{So what you're telling me Mr. Sullivan is that the music appears to be about to stop and we are going to be holding the biggest bag of stinking shit ever assembled in the history of capitalism?}
<ACTION>__{Everyone looks back at PETER.}
<CHAR>__{JOHN TULD } <CHAR_PAR>__{(cont'd)}
<DIAL>__{Mr. Sullivan?}
<CHAR>__{PETER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well sir, I'm not sure I'd put it that way but let me clarify using your analogy, what this model shows is the music, so to speak, just slowing, if the music were to stop, as you put it, then this model would not be even close to that scenario. It would be considerably worse.}
<CHAR>__{JOHN TULD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well let me tell you something Mr. Sullivan. Do you want to know why I'm sitting here in this chair with you all, why I get the big bucks, so to speak?}
<CHAR>__{PETER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes.}
<CHAR>__{JOHN TULD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{I'm here to guess what the music is gonna do a week, month, a year from now. That's it, nothing more....... and I'm afraid... standing here tonight... that I don't hear... a... thing... just silence.}

<CHAR>__{JOHN TULD } <CHAR_PAR>__{(cont'd)}

<ACTION>__{Long Silence.}
<CHAR>__{JOHN TULD } <CHAR_PAR>__{(cont'd)}
<DIAL>__{Mr. Cohen, Ms. Robertson, I'm afraid this is where you are supposed to step back in. Lord knows we relied enough on Mr. Sullivan today.}
<ACTION>__{JARED and SARAH come to attention and gather their thoughts.}
<CHAR>__{JOHN TULD } <CHAR_PAR>__{(cont'd)}
<DIAL>__{What have you got for us?}
<ACTION>__{Long pause.}
<CHAR>__{JOHN TULD } <CHAR_PAR>__{(cont'd)}
<DIAL>__{What have I told you since the first day you walked into my office? (pause) That there are three ways to make a living in this business... Be first, be smarter, or cheat. Well I don't cheat, and even though I like to think we have got some pretty smart people in this building of the two remaining options, it sure is a hell of alot easier to just be first.}
<ACTION>__{The room goes silent again as Mr. Tuld stares back out the window.}
<CHAR>__{JARED COHEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sell it all today...}

<DIAL>__{You'll get the bonus, the options, and keep your current base, but I need you to stay with me for another 24 months. O.K?}
<ACTION>__{They look at each other, SAM seems to know it's not actually a question. SAM is a shell of himself as TULD takes another hearty bite of his meal. He finally looks up.}
<CHAR>__{TULD } <CHAR_PAR>__{(cont'd)}
<DIAL>__{For God's sake man put a smile on your face, you did some good today, you said so yourself. I'm starting to feel a little better about this whole thing. You're one of the luckiest guys in the world, you could've been digging ditches all these years...}
<ACTION>__{SAM pushes back his chair, stands, and prepares to leave.}
<CHAR>__{SAM ROGERS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's true, and if I had been at least there'd be some holes in the ground to show for it. I'm just not quite sure how we fucked this thing up so badly.}
<ACTION>__{This pushes TULD a bit too far. He also senses he may be losing SAM. He drops his fork, and his tone changes.}
<CHAR>__{TULD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Jesus, when did you start feeling so sorry for yourself, it's unbearable... What, you think we may have helped put some people out of business today? That it's all just for naught? Well you've been doing that everyday for almost forty years Sam. And if all this is for naught then so is everything else out there. It's just money, it's made up, a piece of paper with some pictures on it so we don't all kill each other trying to get something to eat. But it's not wrong and it's certainly not any different today than it's ever been. Ever. 1637, 1797, 1819, `37, `57,`84, 1901, `07, 1929, `37, `73, and 1987... God damn did that motherfucker fuck me up good, 92, 97, 2000, and whatever this is gonna be called. They're just the same thing over and over. We can't help ourselves, and you and I can't control it, stop it, slow it, or even ever so slightly alter it... We just react... and we get paid well for it if we're right... and get left by the side of the road if we're wrong. There's always been and there's always gonna be the same percentage of winners and losers, happy fucks and sad sacks, fat pigs and starving dogs in this world... yes there may be more of us today... but the percentages... they always stay exactly the same.}
<ACTION>__{They stare at each other for a long beat and then TULD looks down and takes another bite. He chews. He looks up again.}
<CHAR>__{SAM ROGERS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'll do it John, but not because of your little speech, but because I need the money. I'm not sure how it could possibly be after all these years, but I need the money.}
<ACTION>__{They both look at each other again, then look over and see JARED COHEN walking down the dining room aisle with PETER SULLIVAN next to him.}
<CHAR>__{SAM ROGERS } <CHAR_PAR>__{(cont'd)}
<DIAL>__{You're keeping the kid?}
<CHAR>__{JOHN TULD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Keeping him? He's getting promoted. It's all hands on deck now Sam, there's going to be a lot of money to be made coming out of this mess, we're going to need all the brains we can get around here.}
<ACTION>__{They look at each other one last time then SAM starts walking away and as he passes PETER he just gives him a slight nod.}
<TRANS>__{VERY SLOW FADE TO BLACK: OVER BLACK:}
<ACTION>__{We hear the sound of someone digging in dirt with a shovel.}
<TRANS>__{FADE IN:}
<LOC>__{EXT. VERY UPSCALE OLD GROWTH SUBURBAN NYC BACKYARD- 11:00 PM 74 74}
<ACTION>__{Fade up on SAM ROGERS standing in a hole in the backyard digging. Next to him is a large black medical-looking bag. He continues to dig. Eventually the flood lights from the house come on and the whole back yard lights up. Then the door opens and a woman in her fifties wearing a bath robe and slippers comes out onto the deck. It is SAM'S EX-WIFE. MARY ROGERS. She squints towards the back of the yard.}
<CHAR>__{MARY ROGERS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hello! ... I've called the police.}
<ACTION>__{SAM stops digging and looks up and leans on the shovel handle.}
<CHAR>__{SAM ROGERS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Mary.}
<CHAR>__{MARY ROGERS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sam?}
<CHAR>__{SAM ROGERS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yup.}
<CHAR>__{MARY ROGERS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What are you doing?}
<ACTION>__{She comes down off the deck and walks across the lawn up next to the hole.}
<CHAR>__{MARY ROGERS } <CHAR_PAR>__{(cont'd)}
<DIAL>__{What are you doing?}
<CHAR>__{SAM ROGERS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Ella died.}
<ACTION>__{MARY looks down and sees the large canine body bag.}
<CHAR>__{MARY ROGERS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh God.}
<CHAR>__{SAM ROGERS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Tumor on her liver. It was horrible.}
<CHAR>__{MARY ROGERS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well I'm very sorry.}
<CHAR>__{SAM ROGERS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah... I really loved that dog}
<CHAR>__{MARY ROGERS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I know, but Sam you don't live here anymore.}
<CHAR>__{SAM ROGERS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I was driving home from the vet and this is the only place I could think to bury her. This is where she belongs...}
<ACTION>__{She looks at him deeply.}
<CHAR>__{MARY ROGERS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well. You should have called.}
<CHAR>__{SAM ROGERS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I know.}
<CHAR>__{MARY ROGERS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Are you alright? You look terrible.}
<CHAR>__{SAM ROGERS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah. Tough day all around.}
<CHAR>__{MARY ROGERS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I heard, Sammy called.}
<CHAR>__{SAM ROGERS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Is he alright?}
<CHAR>__{MARY ROGERS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{He said they got hammered, but got out alive.}
<CHAR>__{SAM ROGERS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Good, I was going to call him this morning... but...}
<CHAR>__{MARY ROGERS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, I am going to go back in to bed. The alarm is on so don't try to break in.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(Sam smiles)}
<DIAL>__{Well, you take care of yourself.}
<CHAR>__{SAM ROGERS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Is it alright if I finish up here?}
<CHAR>__{MARY ROGERS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes.}
<ACTION>__{MARY walks back across the lawn into the house and turns off the lights. SAM starts back in digging the ditch and starts humming a song. He keeps digging as the song he is humming then kicks in with the full version.}
<TRANS>__{FADE TO BLACK:}
<CHAR>__{THE END} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
