<A>__{annie, watching him.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{then light the match, paul.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no big deal.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{so you've indicated. do it.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{the matches. paul's hands are starting to tremble now. he can't do it.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i know this is the only copy, paul. when you were twenty four you wrote your first book and you didn't make a copy, because you didn't think anybody would take it seriously. but they did. and ever since you've never made any copies because you're superstitious it's why you always come back to the silver creek lodge. you told that story to merv griffin eleven years ago.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you know, annie, this book never would have survived without you. when it gets to new york, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{god knows you're entitled to it.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{oh, paul. this isn't about money. it's about decency and purity. it's about god's values.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you're right. you're right. i don't know what i was thinking. i will tell you what. it doesn't have to be published. nobody ever has to see it. i will just keep it for myself. no one will ever have to know it exists.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{as long as it does exist, your mind won't ever be free. i think you should light the match, paul.}
<A>__{there is a long silence. paul doesn't move.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{can't you see it's what god wants?}
<A>__{she's holding the can of lighter fluid in her hand as she speaks and absentmindedly flicks a few drops of the fluid on the bed.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{you're so brilliant. i would think you'd certainly be able to see that.}
<P>__{(more drops fall on the bed)}
<D>__{we're put on this earth to help people, paul. like i'm trying to help you.}
<A>__{paul watches as the fluid continues to drop on the bed.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{please let me help you.}
