<L>__{interior a caribbean hotel, bar day, 1963}
<A>__{a small caribbean hotel. we see benjamin and daisy sitting at a table drinking, talking in a nearly empty bar... wind and rain lashing the hotel... waiting out a tropical storm...}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{we wouldn't have this... we wouldn't be here... it happened when it was supposed to happen...}
<A>__{they look at each other...}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{relationships have a time and a place.}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{don't say that.}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{what i mean is... you don't usually get more than one chance. if you miss it, it's too late... and it's gone... we're lucky... we had more than one chance.}
<C>__{daisy}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{that's easy for you to say... you'll have plenty of chances.}
<A>__{she tenderly touches his hand... they look at each other... and dedicating herself...}
<C>__{daisy }
<D>__{i'm going to enjoy every moment i have with you...}
<A>__{the waiter's come over.}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{have you ever had a sazerac with whiskey not brandy?}
<C>__{daisy's}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i'm with you, aren't i? i will try anything.}
<A>__{and the wind changes direction, the rain coming in through the open windows of the bar, getting them wet... people run for cover...}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{bet i can stay out here longer than you can.}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{bet you can't.}
<A>__{and as they both sit doggedly in the rain...}
