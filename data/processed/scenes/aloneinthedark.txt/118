<A>__{batteries of flash mines (mines that explode with a burst of blinding light) set to electromagnetic sensors are being positioned in wide perimeters around the entrance hall. automatic gatling guns loaded with chains of glowing bullets are set up at key points around the area. the gatling guns are mounted on swiveling robotic bases, able to automatically turn to face on coming targets. agent feenstra (mid 30s) tests the motion sensor on one of the gatling guns with her hand. the gun swivels accurately to match the movement of her hand. agent feenstra nods to the two agents standing behind the gatling gun. they tinker with its guidance system.}
