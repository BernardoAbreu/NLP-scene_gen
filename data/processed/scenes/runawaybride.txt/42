<A>__{maggie indicates column to peggy. she looks over at the part of the shop used to wash and dye hair. there's a sink, stool and a cabinet affixed to the wall above sink, which holds various shampoos and hair dyes. maggie gets an idea. maggie and peggy step forward toward ike.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash? you know, get all that city grit out of it.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{you'll answer my questions? maggie nods affirmatively.}
<C>__{ike }
<P>__{(removing his jacket)}
<A>__{fine. you wash, i will ask the questions.}
<C>__{peggy}
<A>__{great. ike hands peggy his jacket. a mystified peggy leads ike to the sink. while she does this...}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{have a seat. peggy, why don't you give him the special treatment that strengthens the follicles. ike sits in the chair near the sink. maggie shakes out a smock and puts it around ike.}
<C>__{maggie }
<A>__{so, what do you want to know? ike leans and rests his head on the sink. peggy bends over him and wets his hair. she grabs various hair coloring products.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{getting nervous?}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{nervous? not at all! no. i've never been more certain in my life. except i am having all kinds of weird dreams. ike pulls the cloth down from over his face.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{weird dreams? you're going to tell me about them?}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{yes.}
<C>__{peggy}
<P>__{(calming)}
<A>__{let's just put this back here for the aromatherapy. peggy recovers his face, then continues to fuss with the hair coloring products. maggie helps.}
