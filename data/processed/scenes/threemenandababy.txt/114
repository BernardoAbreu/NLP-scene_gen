<L>__{interior apartment night}
<A>__{peter, michael and jack have guests over for dinner. classical music, a very fancy table, candles: they're at the tail end of the dinner, before dessert. everyone is very fashionably dressed. natalie is sitting between peter and carl. jay and jerry, peter's partners, are also there with their wives. michael and sophia are having a vehement discussion as usual, jack is between two gorgeous models: christie and caroline.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{have you seen the latest bi annual at the whitney? incredible! have you seen it, peter?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{no, i haven't had the time lately.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{ah... working hard on the competition, are you? you may as well throw in the t square, old friend, you haven't got a chance.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(somewhat harshly)}
<D>__{i only wish he was working hard on the competition, but unfortunately, that's not the case...}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{really? what's he doing then? he's always so busy.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{maybe he's working hard on women! some people have to work really hard to get anything!}
<A>__{natalie bursts out laughing. peter's about to respond, but stops himself suddenly. in the b.g., a baby can be heard crying. peter, jack, and michael exchange glances. jack rushes out. the guests haven't heard anything.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(whispering to natalie)}
<D>__{why do you always have to bring carl along with you?}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{don't you like him?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{oh, c'mon i love him! only, i'd like to see you alone for once, that's all.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{he's extremely talented in fact, i hate to tell you this, but i think he and his group are gonna win the competition.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{well, we'll see about that.}
<A>__{jack returns to the table. peter's eyes follow him nervously.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(in a low tone, to jack)}
<D>__{did you give her something to drink?}
<C>__{christie}
<P>__{(drunkenly)}
<D>__{oh, cut it out! no more for me! i've had eight glasses!}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(in a low tone, to michael)}
<D>__{i tried, but she doesn't want anything }
<C>__{christie}
<D>__{i do so want some, but if i have anymore i will pass out!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{save room for dessert it's a three tiered cake from balducci's!}
<C>__{everyone}
<D>__{oh! wow!}
<C>__{christie}
<P>__{(greedily)}
<D>__{i love three tiered cakes!}
<C>__{jay's wife}
<D>__{so what's it made of?}
<A>__{in the b.g., the baby starts crying again.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{umm, it's made with whipped cream and loads of nipples on top i mean, loads of... raspberries ... i will be right back...}
<A>__{peter rushes out of the room. michael and jack exchange glances. the crying continues.}
<C>__{sophia}
<D>__{are you saying that's not art? are you really saying that's not art? well, then, you explain what it is.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{well, it's... art. i will be right back.}
<A>__{he gets up and goes out. jack watches him.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{jack, tell me about those exotic places, what is caracas like?}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(his mind elsewhere)}
<D>__{well, actually... uh, lately i've been to washington a lot... and uh... i will be right back.}
<A>__{he gets up and goes out.}
