<L>__{exterior ice cave day}
<A>__{(scene 1350 meet drago) astrid and the gang stealthily approach a cluster of tabular icebergs, collapsed against each other at the mouth of a maze. stormfly drops eret to the snow, but before he can flee, she lands atop him and nests like a hen with her egg.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{agghh! okay! i got you here, now get this thing off me!}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{never take a toy from a dragon. don't you know anything?}
<A>__{stormfly crushes him in place under her weight.}
<C>__{eret}
<P>__{(strained)}
<D>__{gah! why does this keep happening to me?}
<A>__{astrid crawls up the rising ridge to reveal... a massive flotilla, moored together like a floating camp in the deep water between collided icebergs. thick chains run deep into the water, where great blasts of bubbles erupt on the surface. the unseen creature rocks the ships. its effect alone describes it as gargantuan.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{what's down there?}
<A>__{fishlegs rifles through his note cards contained in his belt pouch.}
<C>__{fishlegs}
<D>__{large diameter bubbles, massive lungs, cold water deep dweller, i'm thinking class five leviathan, maybe six.}
<A>__{suddenly, stormfly is alerted to an encroaching menace and takes wing. blow darts whiz through the air, hitting the other dragons. the effect is immediate they fall to the ground, unconscious. drugged.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{meatlug! what's wrong, girl?}
<A>__{eret spring to his feet and draws his blades. astrid and the gang find themselves surrounded by soldiers, camouflaged in polar bear furs, and poised to fire darts. they're outnumbered. fishlegs raises his hands, dropping the cards.}
