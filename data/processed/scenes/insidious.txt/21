<A>__{josh sits with foster, zoned out in front of the droning tv.}
<L>__{interior basement night}
<A>__{pitch black. dazed, dalton sits up. his head is cut and bleeding. he is alone in the dark. he stares into the corner of the surrounding cell. his eyes adjust, making out a shape. a shadow.}
<L>__{interior living room same time}
<A>__{josh and renai look up as the quiet is shattered by a scream. they spring into action, scrambling to their feet.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{dalton? where are you?}
<A>__{he doesn't answer. just keeps screaming.}
<L>__{interior basement night}
<A>__{renai and josh whip the door open, glaring into the basement from the top of the stairs.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{dalton?}
<A>__{dalton is crumpled at the bottom of the steps, sobbing, his red cape gathered around him. renai flicks the light on. her and josh scamper down the steps, propping dalton up.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{dalton}
<D>__{i fell.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{dalton, you have to be careful. you shouldn't be coming down here in the dark.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{where do you hurt the most?}
<C>__{dalton}
<D>__{my knee and my head. i can't stand up.}
<A>__{josh lifts him to his feet. a severely grazed knee is dotted with blood. he's okay.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{you scared us, champ.}
<A>__{josh carries him up the stairs as he sucks in sobs. renai glances around the basement, her eyes landing on the lone object that resides in it. she frowns. it wasn't there when she saw the basement last. it is a box. one of her large, cardboard moving boxes. it is marked lamps.}
