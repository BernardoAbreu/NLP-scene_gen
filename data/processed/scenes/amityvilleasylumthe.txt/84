<A>__{lisa pushes open the door to ward x. she peers down the dark hallway. the girl is nowhere to be seen.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{little girl?}
<A>__{lisa slowly walks down the hallway, passing the cell doors. she can hear whispering. lisa is drawn to the last door on the left. she approaches with caution. stood in front of the door she slowly slides the hatch open and peers inside. john doe sits in the corner, cloaked in shadow. lisa peers down and in the centre of the floor, illuminated by a single shaft of light from the small window, is a teddy bear. lisa slides the hatch shut and walks backwards. she is seriously unnerved. as she steps back from the door she hears a whispering from kimble's cell. she edges closer to his cell door and listens.}
<C>__{kimble }
<D>__{palmer... hey palmer...}
<A>__{palmer can be heard from the next cell. his voice is calm, in stark comparison to kimble's which sounds extremely agitated.}
<C>__{palmer }
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{kimble }
<D>__{my cock is so hard palmer. it's so hard that i can't contain it any more. i'm going to break through this wall and do bad things to you. very, very bad.}

<D>__{i must advise you mister kimble threats will not be well received.}
<C>__{kimble }
<D>__{i'm touching myself palmer. you wanna watch? you fucking faggot!}
<C>__{palmer }
<D>__{stay out of my psyche mister kimble and i will stay out of yours.}
<A>__{kimble starts to chuckle. then he stops suddenly. lisa leans closer to the cell door and she hears kimble sniffing. thud! lisa jumps back as kimble kicks the cell door.}
<C>__{kimble }
<D>__{i know you're out there girlie. i can smell your pussy. how about you join me in here. come on!}
<A>__{kimble bangs the door continuously. the racket echoes through the corridor. sadie soon joins in, her and kimble laugh maniacally as they thump on the doors. a horrified lisa rushes towards the exit.}
