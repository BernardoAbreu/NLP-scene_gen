<L>__{interior high school hallway day}
<A>__{continuing her narration, veronica glides through a bustling high school hallway with a frozen smile.}
<C>__{veronica }
<D>__{she said real life sucks losers dry. if you want to fuck with the eagles, you have to learn to fly.}
<B>__{outside the cafeteria}
<A>__{with her back turned to the viewer, veronica stands at the outskirts of the cafeteria entrance. the viewer's viewpoint approaches and finally curls around veronica to reveal that she is writing in a diary, wearing a monocle.}
<C>__{veronica }
<D>__{i said so you teach people how to spread their wings and fly. she said yes.}
<B>__{the diary page}
<A>__{veronica's pen sways across the diary page forming the words echoed by her voice over.}
<C>__{veronica }
<D>__{i said you're beautiful.}
<A>__{a sudden off screen bark from heather mcnamara causes the pen to recklessly rocket across the written words.}
<C>__{heather mcnamara }
<D>__{god, come on veronica!}
<A>__{veronica coolly pops the monocle from her eye before angrily addressing the amusingly robust, conventionally beautiful, trendily coiffed heather mcnamara.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{what's your damage, heather? you ruined my...}
<C>__{heather mcnamara}
<D>__{god, i'm so sure. don't blame me, blame heather. she told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto. back me up, heather.}
<A>__{from behind heather mcnamara emerges a similarly trendily accessorized but noticeably more inhibited waif, heather duke. she is clutching a tattered copy of "the catcher in the rye."}
<C>__{heather duke}
<D>__{yeah, she really wants to talk to you.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{okay, i'm going, i'm going. jesus...}
<B>__{inside the cafeteria}
<A>__{veronica, flanked by heather mcnamara and heather duke, strides into the lunchroom pandemonium. the stunning heather chandler turns from the tray before her toward her incoming comrades. she is dressed stylishly and expensively but not trendily; her hair, dramatically tied back.}
<C>__{veronica}
<P>__{(submissively)}
<D>__{hello, heather.}
<A>__{pulling out a crumpled piece of yellow paper, heather chandler smiles. the content of what heather says is consistently offensive but the tone in which she speaks is sexy, dangerous, and mysterious. she is a mythic bitch.}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{veronica. finally. got a paper of kurt kelly's. i need you to forge a hot and horny but realistically low key note in kurt's handwriting and we'll slip it into martha dumptruck's lunch tray.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{shit, heather. i don't have anything against martha dunnstock.}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{you don't have anything for her either. come on, it'll be very. the note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{i will think about it.}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<P>__{(looking off)}
<D>__{don't think.}
<B>__{pov on cafeteria line}
<A>__{unattractive and quite overweight, martha dunnstock dumptruck guiltily plops two jellos on her tray and clunks forward in line.}
<B>__{cafeteria entrance}
<A>__{veronica's arm, seemingly involuntary, latches onto the outstretched pen.}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{splendid. i will dictate. veronica needs something to write on. heather, bend over.}
<A>__{both heather mcnamara and heather duke bend over. heather chandler violently laughs.}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{how nice. two assholes: no waiting.}
<A>__{heather mcnamara and heather duke stand erect, embarrassed.}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{heather duke, back down.}
<A>__{veronica scurries to the contorting heather duke.}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{dear martha, you're so sweet..}
<A>__{the jocks' table the traditionally handsome kurt kelly, the serene black earl frazier and the massive ram sit with other stereotypical jocks taking in veronica and the heathers.}
<C>__{kurt}
<D>__{it'd be so righteous to be in a veronica sawyer heather chandler sandwich. punch it in, ram.}
<A>__{kurt and ram raise their right arms and slam their fists together.}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{hell yes. i wanna set a heather on my johnson and just start spinning her like a fucking pinwheel.}
<A>__{ram makes a frantic spinning motion. earl is bored.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{shit. right.}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{damn right right.}
<B>__{cafeteria entrance}
<A>__{in slow motion, veronica finishes the note and rises up along with her makeshift desk, heather duke. heather mcnamara hawkishly gazes toward the cafeteria line. veronica hands the note to an impressed heather chandler. martha dunnstock dumptruck pays the cashier and then, grasping her lunch tray with both paws, moves toward veronica and the heathers. heather mcnamara excitedly tugs on heather chandler's arm as martha approaches. with a tranquil smile, heather chandler passes the note to her frantic disciple. in a self consciously clandestine manner, heather mcnamara saunters past martha then wields around to sneakily tuck the note onto martha's tray. the slow motion concludes as their plump victim shuffles past a magnetic preppie peter dawson and a thin, black, bespectacled dennis. the guys are working a large stand which has a cashbox reading the famine fund and a banner reading westerburg feeds the world.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{come on people, let's give that leftover lunch money to people without lunches! those tater tots you threw away today are a delicacy in africa! they're thanksgiving dinner!}
<A>__{heathers' table the girls reach their table with heather mcnamara and heather duke sitting themselves down first.}
<C>__{heather mcnamara}
<P>__{(looking to the stand)}
<D>__{god, aren't they fed yet? do they even have thanksgiving in africa?}
<C>__{veronica}
<P>__{(low key sarcasm)}
<D>__{oh sure, pilgrims, indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.}
<A>__{heather chandler draws up a clipboard.}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{sawyer. guess what today is?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{ouch....the lunchtime poll. so what's the question?}
<C>__{heather duke}
<D>__{yeah, so what's the question?}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{god damn heather, you were with me in study hall when i thought of it. such a pillowcase.}
<C>__{heather duke}
<P>__{(hurt)}
<D>__{i forgot.}
<A>__{veronica and heather chandler briskly bop away from the table as a wounded heather duke retreats to the catcher in the rye.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{shut up, it is. i told dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, i'd spew burrito chunks.}
<A>__{veronica shakes her head and looks off. she's suddenly captured by the sight of a james deanesque guy sitting stark in a long, tan gunslinger coat, behind a rebel without a cause lunchbox. they make eye contact. transfixed, veronica crashes into seated betty finn, a slightly overweight, unstylishly dressed sweetie surrounded by clones.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{sorry veronica.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{betty finn. gosh.....}
<A>__{veronica crouches down, embarrassed and rueful.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{i'm really sorry i couldn't make it to your birthday party last month.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{that's okay. your mom said you had a big date. heck, i'd probably skip my own birthday party for a date.}
<A>__{veronica gently laughs at betty's innocent awe.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{don't say that.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{oh ronnie, you have to look at what i dug up the other day.}
<A>__{betty pulls from her purse a picture showing a young betty finn and veronica sawyer, arm in arm, dressed in halloween costumes: betty is an angel, veronica is a witch. veronica glows at the photo until heather chandler tows veronica away causing the picture to fall face up on the floor.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{i was talking with someone!}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{color me impressed. i thought you grew out of betty finn.}
<A>__{the country club kids' table a coolly coed cabal of country club kids icily eye the approaching veronica and heather chandler. country club kid coutrney sourly speaks out.}
<C>__{courtney}
<D>__{oh great. here comes heather.}
<C>__{courtney's friend}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{martha dunnstock dumptruck's table alone at a table in the siberia of the cafeteria, martha finishes a forkful of chicken. she spears her plate again and brings the fork up. the note is wedged inside it. the country club kids' table heather chandler, veronica in tow, hits the country club kids with a salvo of false pleasantness, capped by a scowling smile.}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{hi courtney. love your blouse. ooh, let me snare a tater.}
<A>__{courtney express elation in spite of yourself as heather chandler delicately takes a tot and turns around to face veronica. heather chandler inserts her finger in her mouth doing the "induce vomiting" signal before devouring the tot and turning back around.}
<C>__{courtney}
<D>__{thanks. i just got it last night at the limited. totally blew my allowance.}
<A>__{heather chandler raises her clipboard. veronica closes her eyes and shakes her head with a half smile.}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{that's pretty very. now check this out. you win five million dollars from publishers clearing house, but on the same day ed mcmahon gives you the check, aliens land on earth and say they're going to blow up the world in two days. what would you do?}
<A>__{a stunned tableau; until country club kid keith speaks.}
<C>__{keith}
<D>__{that's easy. i'd just slide that wad over to my father. he's like one of the top brokers in the state .}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{wake up. in two days, earth's going up like a roman candle. crab nebula city.}
<C>__{keith}
<D>__{man, in two days, my dad could double my money. triple it.}
<C>__{courtney}
<D>__{if i got that money, i'd give it all to the poor. every cent.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{you're beautiful.}
<B>__{the famine fund stand}
<A>__{peter reaches into the famine fund box and takes some bills.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{dennis, my man, run over to mickey d.'s and get me a big mac and some fries.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{but that's the famine fund money.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{hey, even bob geldof's got to eat. if it makes you feel better, bag the fries, and nab yourself an apple pie.}
<B>__{cafeteria thoroughfare}
<A>__{heather chandler drags veronica down a cafeteria lane.}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{if you're going to openly be a bitch....}
<C>__{veronica}
<P>__{(submissive)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{fuck me gently with a chainsaw. do i look like mother theresa? if i did, i probably wouldn't mind talking to the geek squad.}
<A>__{she points to a table of unfashionably dressed and coiffed students. some wear glasses, some wear braces, some wear both. the geeks' table the geeks react to being pointed at. their boney leader rodney splatters milk over himself.}
<C>__{rodney}
<D>__{did you see that? heather number one looked right at us.}
<C>__{big cynic}
<D>__{it must be love.}
<B>__{cafeteria thoroughfare}
<A>__{veronica confronts heather chandler.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{like i give a shit. they all want me, as a friend or a fuck. i'm worshipped at westerburg and i'm only a junior.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<P>__{(giving in)}
<D>__{whatever. i don't believe this. we're going to a party at remington university tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school.}
<A>__{martha dunnstock dumptruck's table her sweaty lips moving rapidly, martha anxiously reads the note. the geeks' table the nervous geeks fidget and roughhouse each other in an involuntarily immature reaction to their beautiful interviewers.}

<D>__{no seriously, i'd probably go to the pyrimads. with a girl.}
<C>__{geek with glasses}
<D>__{where you going to get a girl, stud? k mart?}

<P>__{(quietly to the others)}

<A>__{veronica tugs heather chandler away from the table.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{if you're going to openly be a bitch....}
<A>__{veronica again catches sight of the james deanesque guy. he wraps his fingers around an egg and unfolds them back. the egg is gone. he smiles. veronica smiles back. her trance is broken by a boisterous heather mcnamara and heather duke who careen into the two pollsters.}
<C>__{heather mcnamara}
<D>__{god, scan on martha dumptruck.}
<B>__{pov on martha}
<A>__{martha looks up from the note to the jocks' table and kurt kelly, then flustered, back down at the note.}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{this is the part i hate. the waiting. i'd say we're like twenty minutes from major humiliation. come on, veronica.}
<A>__{heather chandler floats off. a disturbed veronica takes a moment to react.}
