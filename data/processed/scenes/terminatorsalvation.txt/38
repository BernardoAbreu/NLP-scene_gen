<A>__{star closes tattered curtains, plops on the bare bed, ready for sleep. the room's a mess, graffiti here and there, trash scattered about; they're not the first squatters who've been here. the guns and star's watch lie on a dresser. kyle sits before the tv he's scratching stick figures onto the screen with a rusted pocketknife. one is clearly meant to be him; the smaller one, wearing a baseball cap, is star.}

<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{max must be dead too, now... like everybody else.}
<A>__{marcus notices now that kyle is asleep it's as if he's lulled him with a bedtime story. marcus is oddly touched, pulls a cover over both the kids. kyle starts, half asleep }

<D>__{you gonna be here when i wake up?}
<C>__{marcus}
