<D>__{lestat.}
<A>__{marius looks up. the two vampires regard each other for a long moment. lestat is overcome with conflicting emotions. guarded smiles rise to their faces.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{it is good to see you, lestat.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{and you. still wearing the old fashions, i see.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{old habits die hard.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{how did you manage to slip through the 1950s in red velvet?}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{i slept.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{don't think you missed much.}
<C>__{marius}

<D>__{you're bigger than he is now.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{i'd say a few pounds lighter. though, if you ever catch me wearing a white jumpsuit, you have my permission to slice off my head.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{if someone doesn't get to you first.}
<A>__{lestat grins, feeling marius's disapproval.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{live and let live.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{if it were only so simple, my son.}
<C>__{lestat}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{how did you find me?}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{you forget. we ancients have powers no ordinary vampires possess... and i know you. i remembered how you admired the medieval fortresses in the hilltowns of lyon.}
<P>__{(gestures to house)}
<D>__{all you're missing is the moat and the cannons... which you may need.}
<A>__{lestat doesn't want to hear it.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{come, let me show you what it means to live in the light.}
