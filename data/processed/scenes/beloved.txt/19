<L>__{exterior 124 bluestone road day.}
<A>__{c.u. paul d. garner. paul stands on the road, gazing up at the house. grateful he's arrived, cautious about what he'll find, he steps towards the porch. his clothes are ragged. his feet sore and blistering in his shoes.}
<L>__{exterior the pump day.}
<A>__{off to the side of the house, sethe washes her feet and legs at the pump. she looks up and sees paul's figure walking towards the house. the sun blazes in her eyes. she can't make out who it is, or whether or not he's even real. as he reaches the porch, paul disappears from view. sethe walks towards the front of the house. when she is little more than forty feet away, she stops still not certain paul is a real man or an hallucination of the past.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{paul? paul d.? is that you?}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{what's left.}
<P>__{(he rises)}
<D>__{how you been girl, besides barefoot?}
<A>__{sethe jams her balled up stockings into her pocket. she smiles like a little girl, not able to believe her eyes.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{you looking good.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{devil's confusion. he lets me look good long as i feel bad.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{how long has it been?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{'bout eighteen years, i figure.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{eighteen years.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{and i swear i been walking every one of them. mind if i join you?}
<A>__{he begins taking off his shoes.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{you want to soak them? let me get you some water.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no, uh, uh. can't baby feet. a whole more tramping they got to do yet.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{you're not leaving right away, are you? you stay awhile.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{well, long enough to see baby suggs, you..where is she?}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{dead.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{aw no. when?}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{eight years now. almost nine.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{was it hard? i hope she didn't die hard.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{soft as cream. being alive was the hard part. sorry you missed her though. is that what you came by for?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{that's some of what i came for. the rest is you.}
<A>__{sethe doesn't know what to do with her eyes when he says this..she looks away instinctively. paul realizes that may have sounded too intimate so he leans back and sighs:}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{the truth be known, i go anywhere these days. anywhere they let me sit down.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{come on inside.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{porch is fine. cool out here. sit with me.}
<A>__{like a nervous little girl, sethe takes a sit beside a man for the first time in years, folding her sweat stained skirt beneath her.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{so baby suggs is gone. somehow never thought death would find her.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{it finds everyone.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{we managed well enough without meeting it.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{i suppose.}
<A>__{awkward pause. sethe tries to find the words to a difficult question but one that is foremost in her mind;}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{i wouldn't have to ask about him, would i?...you'd tell me if there was anything to tell, wouldn't you?}
<A>__{paul knows instantly she is asking about halle.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you know i would. but i don't know any more about what happened to halle now than i did then.}
<A>__{something about paul's expression might suggest he's keeping something from her. he turns his gaze outward as he says;}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you must think he's still alive.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{no. i think he's dead. it's just not being sure that keeps him alive.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what did baby suggs think?}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{same. ha, listen to her, all her children dead and she felt each one go the very day and hour it happened.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{when she say halle went?}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{1855. same day my baby was born.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you had that baby, did you? damn, never thought you'd make it. running off pregnant.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{had to. couldn't be no waiting.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{all by yourself too.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{almost. a white girl helped me.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{then she helped herself, god bless her.}
<A>__{awkward silence.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{we got spare rooms. you could stay the night, if you had a mind to.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you don't sound too steady in the offer.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{oh it's..it's truly meant. i just hope you'll pardon my house.}
<A>__{paul smiles a warm, touched smile that after all that they've survived, sethe is worried about what he'll think of her home.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{my house. i like the sound of that.}
<A>__{sethe smiles, then rises to escort him in.}
