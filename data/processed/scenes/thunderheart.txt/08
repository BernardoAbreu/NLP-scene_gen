<L>__{exterior j. edgar hoover building establishing day}
<A>__{the huge, imposing, mausoleum like hoover building, bordered by artificial turf, hemmed by cherry trees in blossom. turning out to be a nice day on pennsylvania avenue.}
<L>__{interior fbi director's conference room day 8x10 black and white photos dealt like cards onto a table,}
<A>__{one on top of another.}
<L>__{1 an aerial shot of some wasteland. 2 a closer bird's eye of the same, what looks like a nasa}
<A>__{photo of mars.}
<L>__{3 a vast expanse of the great plains.}
<A>__{robert f. tully, number two in command, deals a fourth photo onto the table. he is an understated, fatherly man, well manicured in cotton pencil striped shirt, white tab collar and tie. the photos and maps and files a foot deep on the huge table are neatly organized.}
<C>__{intercom}
<D>__{sa levoi, sir.}
<C>__{tully}
<D>__{please.}
<A>__{seated, at the far end of the table, engrossed in the deep spread of information, sa (special agent) frank couture is about to break the record for longest single ash on the end of a cigarette and the smoke forces his eyes into tight, concentrating, slits. "cooch" as they call him in the bureau has seen thirty years in some rough "provinces". he has survived the hoover era and is a legend in the sessions era but survival has honed an edge. an edge with a touch of ironic cop humor. ray enters, walks into a firm shake.}
<C>__{tully}
<D>__{ray...}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{mister tully.}
<C>__{tully}
<D>__{do you want a coffee?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{no. no, no. thank you.}
<A>__{ray sits nervously across from cooch who looks up from the photos and studies the younger man through reading glasses and cigarette smoke, and he looks at him like he doesn't know who the hell he is or why he's sitting there.}
<C>__{tully}
<D>__{levoi, cooch. raymond levoi, criminal division.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{oh, yeah right.}
<A>__{cooch sticks his cigarette in his left hand, shakes with his right.}
<C>__{tully}
<D>__{ray this is ray tully frank couture.}
<C>__{tully}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{couture}
<D>__{hello, ray.}
<A>__{the handshake is still locked. cooch is still squinting at the younger agent. ray obviously knows something about agent couture.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{it's an honor.}
<A>__{tully leans back in his chair, crosses his legs casually.}
<C>__{tully}
<D>__{ray, we're taking you off the street. we need you out in south dakota.}
<A>__{ray's enthusiasm suddenly deflates.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{south dakota...}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{did i do something unsatisfactory, sir?}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{no, ray. you're gonna have to blame that on your grandmother.}
<A>__{ray looks completely baffled now, swinging a look from cooch to tully.}
<C>__{tully}
<D>__{interesting bloodline you have, ray.}
<P>__{(scanning file)}
<D>__{french, scots irish, italian, ...and one eighth american indian.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{sioux indian, right?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i'm not that sure. yeah, i think }
<C>__{tully}
<D>__{ yes, teton sioux. father's side.}
<A>__{ray nods, looks from tully to cooch. what's going on here?}
<C>__{tully}
<D>__{ray, there's been a homicide out in an area known as the badlands. indian reservation.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{it's not the first. there's been several. and our field office in rapid city is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.}
<C>__{tully}
<D>__{the main problem is, ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non indians. relations have not been amicable.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{different culture. hard to penetrate. the indians don't like white cops poking around. and that's why we're in a position where we have to bring in an american indian agent.}
<A>__{tully straightens the edges of a bureau memorandum.}
<C>__{tully}
<D>__{with an indian representative out there, we hope to keep hostilities dormant; this is a cointelpro, selective operations unit, and it'll be easier on agent couture if you can gain the people's trust and maybe }
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{woh, excuse me, sir... i see what you're saying... i've got a little indian blood, that's true. but }
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{i am not an... an indian. i can't just go in and }
<C>__{tully}
<D>__{ your father was part sioux.}
<A>__{a beat. ray lowers his eyes to the photos.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i didn't know him, sir. he passed away when i was six.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{seven.}
<A>__{ray looks up at cooch. another uneasy beat. cooch lights a cigarette as if lighting a cigarette was a science.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{don't worry about it, ray. as long as the people have proof that we sent them one of their own, no one's gonna ask you to weave baskets or make it rain.}
<A>__{ray sits before the files and photos, looking unsure. he has come to garner a promotion but has just been sent to the graveyard. or in the fbi argot, indian country. tully pivots his leather chair in a full circle and slaps an assignment folder down in front of the young agent.}
