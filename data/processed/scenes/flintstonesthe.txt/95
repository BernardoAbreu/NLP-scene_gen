<B>__{above}
<A>__{dust and smoke clear. when we can see again, well, it's not a pretty sight. the entire fibresphere is gone. all that's left, teetering on two spindly supports, are two tiny islands of safety connected by a twisted maze of rubble too small for a human to negotiate... and all that's holding that up is a long guide wire leading to the ground!}
<B>__{closer}

<B>__{fred}
<A>__{rolls out of the net and away from the others. he's slightly stunned, still in the suit. he sits up... suddenly lights snap on all around him! fred looks up and sees his pov cordon of police officers all with weapons aimed right at him. spotlights on the police car roofs (actually little fires with parabolic mirrors) are operated by uniformed monkeys. feldspar is at the head of the group. he cocks his shotgun. the elastic catapults at the hammers twitch menacingly }

<B>__{dino}
<A>__{flanked by wilma, barney and the kids, who are shouting for the police to stop, only dino the wonder bronto has the wits to act!

<A>__{now fred confirms gravel's hunch as the costume head finally pops off. all the cops lower their guns. (strangely, though, feldspar still continues to raise his gun even aims! then an alarmed gravel wrestles it away from his superior.) the flintstones and rubbles dawn safe, they all emotionally embrace. fred even suffers dino's affection. (in the b.g., a police car holding piltdown, pyrite and lava drives past. poindexter lava is chasing the car.)}

<P>__{(with great poignancy)}
<D>__{... a hearty handshake.}

<D>__{i am not being hysterical, i am being fair now the flintsteins and rabbles saved all of our lives, not to mention your reputation.}

<P>__{(to fred and barney)}
<D>__{boys, i'm feeling guilty about how you've been taken advantage of, so i will tell you what... i'm going to give you back all world wide rights to fibrerock, free and clear.}

<C>__{slate}
<D>__{your only obligation will be to cover oh, whatever legal expenses might surface at some later time...}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{you think there's gonna be some?}

<B>__{rescue dinos}
<A>__{several sniff at the air, look curiously at a nearby pile of crumbled fibrerock. one and then another shuffles over, tentatively tastes some... grins... and digs in! seeing this, the "firesauruses" crane out their necks, also begin chowing down on the pile of fibrerock crumbs. fred, barney, slate and others all turn at the growing sound of the animals pigging out. now dino "yi yi yi's" past this group and leaps into the pile, munching like crazy. barney puts out his hand as chunks of fibrerock shower down like rain from the feeding frenzy. catching some pieces, he nibbles on it a little.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{barn...? what's going on?}
<C>__{barney}
<P>__{(sniffing it)}

<C>__{fred}
<D>__{dino kibble...?}
<A>__{disbelieving, fred moves over to the happily munching animals. he has to get on his knees to wiggle in with the pack. he grabs some, stuffs it in his mouth... chews. his eyes widen...}
<C>__{fred}
<P>__{(mouth full)}
<D>__{dhinough khibble!!}
<A>__{he spits it out, takes out the chunk of contract slate wrote on.}
