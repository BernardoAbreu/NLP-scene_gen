<A>__{jim and dave are playing the opening notes of "foxy lady" through cheap, distorting amps. jim plays bass. dave plays guitar and sings into a microphone. they're bad. as in not good. the basement is typical of a midwest middle class young couple half storage and laundry, half makeshift roc room.}

<A>__{close on dave really getting into it, playing to an unseen stadium. behind him jim is very careful with his chords.}
