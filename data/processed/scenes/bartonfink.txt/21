<A>__{watching.}

<B>__{back to barton}

<D>__{yes, colonel.}
<C>__{lipnik}
<D>__{hell, i could take you through it step by step, explain why your story stinks, but i won't insult your intelligence. well all right, first of all: this is a wrestling picture; the audience wants to see action, drama, wrestling, and plenty of it. they don't wanna see a guy wrestling with his soul well, all right, a little bit, for the critics but you make it the carrot that wags the dog. too much of it and they head for exits and i don't blame 'em. there's plenty of poetry right inside that ring, fink. look at "hell ten feet square".}
