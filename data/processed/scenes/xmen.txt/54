<L>__{exterior train night}
<A>__{the train has been brought to a sudden stop but the wheels are still turning. finally, they are shut down.}
<L>__{interior train car night}
<A>__{the lights are out. everyone gathers themselves. then comes a low grinding creak. the sound of metal bending. rivets popping.}
<L>__{exterior train night}
<A>__{like the top of a sardine can, the entire side wall of the train car is peeled off. revealing the terrified passengers inside and magneto, sabretooth, mystique toad and pyro on the outside. with a final thrust, the air ripples and magneto tosses the car wall to the side. passengers from the other cars stare wide eyed out their windows. the train has stopped at a railroad crossing, the gates are down.}
<C>__{magneto}
<D>__{you can come out now, logan. youire among friends.}
<A>__{the transit cop rises to his feet, brandishing his pistol.}
<C>__{transit cop}
<D>__{freeze!}
<A>__{with a turn of his finger, magneto draws the pistol to him. the cop holds tight and is yanked off the train, onto the ground. with another twist of his hand, magneto makes the gun leap from the copis grasp and hover, pointing at the copis head.}
<C>__{magneto}
<D>__{you homo sapiens and your guns.}
<A>__{the gun cocks.}
<C>__{xavier }
<D>__{thatis enough, max!}
<A>__{all turn to see xavier, seated in his wheelchair flanked by cyclops, jean and storm. all, save xavier, are in uniform.}
<B>__{thunder rumbles across the sky}
<A>__{angle on: storm, a gust of wind.}
<C>__{magneto}
<D>__{iill never understand your regard for them, charles.}
<C>__{xavier}
<D>__{and iill never understand terrorists.}
<C>__{magneto}
<D>__{i am trying to save our kind, charles. you should do the same.}
<C>__{xavier}
<D>__{not at the cost of lives, max.}
<A>__{xavier's metal chair is gripped by magnetic forces. it shakes and begins to inch towards magneto.}
<C>__{magneto}
<D>__{magneto.}
<A>__{the chair is pulled closer to magneto. cyclops steps forward. xavier need not turn to know help is coming. magneto sees and respects cyclops's power. the chair stops moving.}
<C>__{xavier}
<P>__{(to cyclops)}
<D>__{itis alright... itis alright.}
<A>__{magneto glances at storm, then cyclops.}
<C>__{magneto}
<D>__{the two in alaska. just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time? still tinkering with cerebro?}
<C>__{xavier}
<P>__{(referring to logan)}
<D>__{what do you want with him?}
<A>__{magneto smiles now, tapping his metal helmet.}
<C>__{magneto}
<D>__{canit read my mind?}
<A>__{xavier's expression falters. it appears as if the helmet has been made to block xavier from doing just that.}
<C>__{magneto }
<D>__{iill tell you something, charles, we are more alike now than we were when we started.}
<C>__{xavier}
<D>__{is that so?}
<C>__{magneto}
<D>__{still trying to make the world safe for our kind. still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves definitively.}
<C>__{xavier}
<D>__{you definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, max. what is it like these days?}
<C>__{magneto}
<D>__{letis just say that i am out to make some radical changes. now come on charles. for old times sake, for your sake... leave him to me.}
<A>__{logan slowly rises from the huddled passengers. sabretooth fighting the urge to move on him. logan glares back at sabretooth.}
<C>__{magneto }
<D>__{ahh... there you are brother. i believe you possess something i am very much in need of.}
<A>__{just then, sabretooth roars uncontrollably and punches toad in the stomach, doubling him over. oddly toad is laughing. he stands upright.}
<C>__{toad}
<D>__{do it again.}
<A>__{another roar and another punch. toad is crying and laughing at the same time.}
<C>__{toad }
<D>__{oh god it hurts. do it again.}
<A>__{magneto watches this, momentarily stunned. suddenly, pyro grabs hold of his face.}
<C>__{pyro}
<D>__{i'm blind.}
<A>__{and mystique morphs into a small child and begins tugging at magnetois pant leg.}
<C>__{mystique}
<D>__{i have to go to the bathroom.}
<A>__{magneto looks at the cause of it all: xavier, his eyes concentrating, has all of magneto's minions under his}
<B>__{psychic control.}
<A>__{cyclops cannot help laughing. storm and jean smile. magneto is furious.}
<C>__{magneto}
<D>__{if i could make you understand. if you could just be made to see it the way i do. the way itis going to be.}
<C>__{xavier}
<D>__{the way what is going to be?}
<C>__{magneto}
<D>__{iim going to change the world with or without you as a witness, charles.}
<P>__{(points to logan)}
<D>__{and this one gets a front row seat.}
<C>__{xavier}
<D>__{what do you mean to do?}
<A>__{and magneto steps back a little further. his oddly behaving consorts follow.}
<C>__{magneto}
<D>__{this checkmate goes to you. i didnit want to hurt anyone. but you leave me no choice.}
<C>__{xavier}
<D>__{what do you mean to do?}
<A>__{sabretooth and toad walk away, still with the punching and asking to be punched. magneto takes the little girl mystique by the hand and the blind pyro by the arm and leads them away, humiliated, to their waiting helicopter. xavier turns back to logan, still standing in the train car, amidst all the huddled passengers. suddenly, all the passengers except rogue lay on the floor and seats and go to sleep. a few of them even snore.}
<C>__{xavier }
<D>__{now will you come back with us?}
<A>__{a look crosses logan's face. uncomfortable.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{look, i appreciate your concern. but, i do better on my own.}
<A>__{xavier indicates the wreckage of the train.}
<C>__{xavier}
<D>__{you got less than sixty miles today. iill make you a deal. two days. if we havenit figured out what magneto wants with you by then... iill bring you back myself.}
<A>__{logan looks up at xavier suspiciously, hating that he is making sense. xavier moves closer. logan looks over at rogue, covered in her layers of clothes. storm is helping her off the train, yet taking care not to touch her skin.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{what are you going to do with her?}
<A>__{xavier looks to rogue. a warmth comes over his face. an look of understanding. at a glance he has read her mind. he knows her pain her struggle. rogue looks to xavier. their eyes meet.}
<C>__{xavier}
<D>__{rogue is a beautiful girl, with an extraordinary power. one that even her own family isnit able to accept. sheis been on her own for weeks now, searching for a home. a place to belong.}
<A>__{xavier turns to logan.}
<C>__{xavier }
<D>__{ weire going to give her that.}
<A>__{logan looks at rogue, contemplating this. then to xavier.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{forty eight hours, old man. but if you cross me, i wonit feel any guilt about what i do to you.}
<C>__{xavier}
<D>__{deal.}
<A>__{logan eyes the rest of the gang until he settles his gaze on jean. he offers a faint seductive smile. this is not lost on cyclops.}
