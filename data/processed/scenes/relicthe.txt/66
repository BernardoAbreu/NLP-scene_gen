<L>__{interior physical anthropology lab day}
<A>__{d'agosta examines the huge centrifuges, autoclaves, electrophoresis apparati, monitors, computers etc. as margo and greg kawakita look at the claw.}
<C>__{kawakita}
<D>__{what do you make of it, margo?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{it's not mammalian, that's for sure. i think it's reptilian.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{that would jive with what we got from the preliminary dna read out. here, have a look.}
<A>__{he hands them a computer read out. margo checks it quickly as kawakita looks on.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{according to this, twenty five percent of the claw dna is unidentifiable, about a third is homo sapien, and the rest is hemidactylus turcicus.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<P>__{(looks over)}
<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{margo pulls off her glasses.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{turkish gecko, i believe. a lizard.}
<C>__{kawakita}
<D>__{lizard dna and human dna on the same strand? impossible. the sample must be contaminated.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{there's another possibility. a lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{genetic damage?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{when dna is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair. viruses can damage dna. so can radiation, certain chemicals. even cancer. let's let the g.s.e. sort it out. i have to get started. this will take several hours.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{we need someone to take us to the secure storage area.}
<C>__{kawakita}
<D>__{try dr. frock. he's the curator of plant biology. all the curators have keys. and he knows every inch of this museum. the rest of us still get lost.}
