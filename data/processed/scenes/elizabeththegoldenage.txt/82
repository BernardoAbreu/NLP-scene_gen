<L>__{interior mary stuart's quarters, chartley hall day}
<A>__{mary paces impatiently in her room, trailed by her little dog. she hears the sound of bells. joy floods her features. pounding feet. she turns to see sir amyas paulet hurrying towards her, through a gate in the wall.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you bring news?}
<C>__{paulet}
<D>__{the queen has been attacked }
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{paulet}
<D>__{the assassin seized }
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{paulet}
<D>__{the queen unharmed }
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{unharmed?}
<C>__{paulet}
<D>__{and you, ma'am, are under arrest.}
<A>__{he has led up to this deliberately, and now stands smiling at her utter confusion. the man who looked like a fool has been playing his own game all along.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{me? what has any of this to do with me?}
<A>__{paulet makes a sign. burton the brewer comes through the gate: walsingham's man after all.}
<C>__{paulet}
<D>__{that's the trouble with intrigue, isn't it? with so many secrets, you can never quite tell who's on who's side, until the game ends.}
<A>__{he takes the hollow bung out of one pocket and admires it.}
<C>__{paulet}
<D>__{my own invention. theatrical, but effective. my master has every letter you've written.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{your master?}
<C>__{paulet}
<D>__{walsingham.}
<A>__{now she knows it's over. she begins to weep.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{traitors. i'm surrounded by traitors. who am i to trust?}
<A>__{she picks up her little dog, weeping bitterly.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{only my little one...}
