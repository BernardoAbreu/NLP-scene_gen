<L>__{exterior mark's mansion poolside night}
<A>__{mark and greg are shit faced, sitting around mark's giant swimming pool.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{hey, watch this.}
<P>__{(yelling over the fence)}
<D>__{hey people!}
<A>__{about forty voices shout back: "he's talking to us!" "maybe he has more answers!" "finally!"}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{the man in the sky just told me something!}
<A>__{mark snickers to himself. greg, drunk and stupid, can't help but snicker too.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you're all gay!}
<A>__{mark and greg explode laughing. from the other side of the fence we can hear people mumbling shock. "i am gay." "i always knew it." "this is going to be awkward for my husband."}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{and adopted!}
<A>__{mark and greg almost roll into the pool they're laughing so hard. the people on the other side of the fence aren't laughing: "who's my real mother?", "this explains so much", "dad, why didn't you tell me?"}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{i don't know why we're laughing. it's really probably very sad for those people.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'm gettin' a beer.}
<A>__{mark hobbles up and walks into the house. moments later he emerges with two cokes.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{out of beer. just coke.}
<A>__{mark tosses greg a coke and sits down on his chaise lounge, cracking open his coke and taking a sip.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i want to do something big again. like telling the people what happens when they die. that felt good. i gotta do something big like that again.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{maybe the man in the sky will tell you something new.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{maybe.}
<A>__{mark looks down at his can of coke. close on coke can: the warning label is extremely long and written in very small type. it starts with, "coke is very bad for you. the following are diseases, physical ailments and general health issues that coke might cause:" the label then goes on to list dozens of ailments. mark's eyes scan down to the very bottom of the label where it says simply, "if you still want to drink coke, do so at your own risk." mark looks over to find greg staring at the depressing label as well.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{ugh, this shit is so bad for you. i really shouldn't drink this.}
<A>__{mark stares at this label for a moment, thinking. with his hand he covers everything on the label except for "please enjoy coke." he smiles widely.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{hey, greg. what if i told you that drinking coke was good for you?}
<A>__{greg turns to him, his face full of hope.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{and not just coke. but all the delicious foods you're not supposed to eat. what if they were all of a sudden really, really good for you?}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{it would be the happiest day of my life.}
