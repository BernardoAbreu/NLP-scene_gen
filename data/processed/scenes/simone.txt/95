<D>__{i've done my homework. i've studied her.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{ i bet you have.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{ i've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.}
<P>__{(afterthought)}
<D>__{oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail. but i have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts. i know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.}

<C>__{max}
<D>__{i know that's what you'd like us to believe. but i got to tell you embezzlement is a serious matter. not to mention abduction.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{abduction?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i don't buy the whole recluse scam. how are you doing it? what is it drugs? blackmail? mind control? all three? what do you do keep her locked in a box somewhere?}

<D>__{that's good.}
