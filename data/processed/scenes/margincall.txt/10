<A>__{sam rogers walks out of his office and stands in front of the trading floor that just an hour before had seated 130 people. now just thirty three are scattered throughout the vast mostly empty space. they all look up in silence at him. long pause, then sam's face begins to glow a bit. his posture straightens, he fills up. he speaks slowly at first then builds.}

<D>__{you are all still here for a reason... most of this floor was just sent home... forever. we have spent the last hour saying good bye... they were good people and they were good at their jobs... but you all were better. now they are gone. they are not to be thought of again. this is your opportunity. on every floor of this building and in every office from hong kong to london the same thing is happening. before this is all done 3 of every ten guys who were standing between you and your boss's job are now gone. that is your opportunity. i've been at this place for thirty four years and let me tell you that this will not be the last time you go through this. but you all are survivors... and that is how this firm over 107 years has always continued to grow stronger. so hold your heads high... and get back to work.}
