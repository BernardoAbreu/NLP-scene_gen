<A>__{neo struggles to fly, and as he does, hes pulling a stalagtite of black suits, clinging like iron filings on a magnet. cu: neo his face is wide with fear and shock. he cant climb anymore, and looks back down at the mountain of agents hes pulling into the air. his face clenches shut as a scream wells from deep within him. he starts to glow, and we jump back to see: a massive orange, spherical shock wave blasts away from his body. it rebounds on the plaza and throws bodies upward, even as it blasts the smiths away, leaving him clean. everything slows down as neo, exhausted, tumbles out of the sky. on his way down through the neon light, he passes bodies flying upward from the concussion. neo hits the ground, bounces, and lies still, sprawled, as people drop all around him, piling up, like satans snowfall.}
