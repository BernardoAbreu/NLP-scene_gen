<L>__{interior exterior tim's buick skylark morning}
<A>__{tim looks pensive as he drives. he's wearing a new suit. it's a little too big. a greeting card and a beanie baby rooster bounce along on the passenger's seat. tim pulls up to a split level house. a pick up truck with the words brodt heating & cooling is parked in the driveway.}
<L>__{interior millie's living room moments later}
<A>__{tim pokes his head into a living room, surprised to see wade, the 60 ish bald guy from church, reclining on a lazy boy. wade's boots are off. his socks are dirty. he's watching espn on a tv with an olan mills portrait of tim & millie atop it.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{oh, hiya tim.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{hey. wade. hey. is millie...?}
<A>__{millie enters in a terry cloth robe. a yorkshire terrier follows her. millie acts nonchalant. so does the dog.}
<C>__{millie}
<D>__{hi tim.}
<P>__{(re. wade's presence)}
<D>__{wade's cable's down.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{it's six am...?}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{mike & mike in the morning. espn 2.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{oh yeah. those guys. hilarious. ha.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{mm.}
<C>__{tim}
<P>__{(finally, to millie)}
<D>__{well i just wanted to...}
<A>__{he displays the beanie baby and the card. she takes them with a cold smile. tim notices an identical stuffed rooster on an oak bookshelf home to over 155 other beanie babies.}
<C>__{tim }
<D>__{oh shoot. you already have a strut the rooster...}
<C>__{millie}
<D>__{so this is it then?}
<P>__{(to wade)}
<D>__{tim's jetting off to cedar rapids this morning, wade. big deal insurance convention. iowa.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{that right?}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{it's only four days.}
<C>__{millie}
<D>__{won't go to germany for our honeymoon, but for work you can just gallivant around like tom petty or one of them?}
<C>__{tim}
<P>__{(to wade)}
<D>__{we agreed on the dells...}
<P>__{(then, to millie)}
<D>__{should we maybe talk in the...?}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{oh it don't bother me.}
<A>__{tim tries to proceed as if wade weren't sitting there.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{if i don't try to do this, it's not just my job, mil. there are four other employees whose lives are on the line. plus carol, who does part time seasonal work. so.}
<C>__{millie}
<D>__{it's not for certain a new owner would even keep you guys on.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{no, bill said he'd make that part of any deal...}
<C>__{millie}
<D>__{believe you me, bill krogstad is looking out for one guy. and that's bill krogstad.}
<C>__{wade}
<P>__{(overtly disparaging)}
<D>__{krogstad.}
<A>__{tim shoots wade a look.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{it's... oh, who am i kidding, i'm a little scared here. a lot scared. but not about us. what we've got we're like lightning in a bottle, babygirl. i love you so much, mil.}
<A>__{he hugs her. millie melts just a little, yet remains stern.}
<C>__{millie}
<D>__{i want you to be very careful.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{i know. i will. i mean, cedar rapids there were only four homicides last year. for a city of 122 thousand that's pretty darn good. the forcible rape numbers are admittedly a bit higher, but...}
<A>__{she fidgets with his tie. a bitter tear skulks down her cheek.}
<C>__{millie}
<D>__{i want you to check in with me.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{i will every day. twice a day.}
<C>__{millie}
<D>__{make it three times.}
<C>__{tim}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{ok, three times! sheesh. and i will send a stinkin' telegram, too.}
<A>__{tim kisses the warm tears from millie's ruddy cheeks. millie licks her finger and smooths tim's cowlick. wade just sits there watching.}
