<A>__{a giddy, almost dreamlike, montage of marian touring new york. she's superimposed over famous landmarks, as if she were standing stationery and the city were in a diorama rotating all around her. the empire state building; circle cruise line; eating a hot dog from a street vendor; shopping at macy's. marian beams as she is magically whisked along, walking on air.}

<A>__{marian comes into the frame around the corner. she has a spring in her step and a broad smile emblazoning her face. but her sanguine mood is quickly shattered when she hears shouting. she freezes in her tracks. across the street the satan's disciples headquarters the disciple prospect and another biker are roughing up a teenage kid, wrestling him into submission.}
<C>__{disciple prospect}
<D>__{you're just chilling, huh? not on this block, do you understand?}
<A>__{marian at the security door of paula's building. she rummages anxiously through her purse, but she can't find her keys!}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{oh, no.}
<A>__{marian glances across the street, her face tensed with fear. across the street the bikers continue to roughhouse the kid. the disciple prospect brandishes a plastic bag under his nose.}
<C>__{disciple prospect}
<D>__{what's this, huh?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{i ain't got shit on me.}
<C>__{disciple prospect}
<D>__{what is that? you're chilling, man? well, then maybe we need to warm things up for you, man. how many times do we got to tell you? you don't listen and you don't learn and that's the problem. that is the problem.}
<A>__{marian turns away from the escalating violence across the street and punches one of the buttons on the intercom. a woman's voice crackles over it.}
<C>__{woman's voice }
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{my daughter lives here and i'm her mother and i've lost my keys.}
<A>__{there's no answer.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{hello? hello?}
<A>__{marian returns her frightened gaze to the altercation across the street. across the street marian's p.o.v. two more disciples emerge from the clubhouse. one of them squirts lighter fluid on the fire burning in the steel drum and the flames explode. then kid is dragged over toward the fire. the disciple prospect drags him dangerously close to the flames.}
<C>__{disciple}
<D>__{roast him!}
<C>__{kid}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{all right all right all right.}
<A>__{marian petrified, as if she'd stepped into a re enactment of a passage out of revelations, walks briskly down to the middle of the block toward a pay phone. disciples clubhouse the disciples kick the drug dealing teenager a couple more times, then set him free, laughing as he flees down the block in mortal fear. pay phone marian drops the appropriate coins in the coin slot and dials a number from memory.}
<C>__{marian}
<P>__{(quavery voice)}
<D>__{yes, is paula there? ... could you leave her a message, please? tell her it's urgent.}
<P>__{(gathers herself)}
<D>__{her mother has lost her keys and is stranded on the street with the satan's disciples ... when she comes back, would you tell her to come home as quickly as she can? ... thank you.}
<A>__{marian hangs up the phone and turns, quails in terror. new angle the disciple prospect is towering over her, staring down at her with a scowl on his face.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{oh, please, don't hurt me.}
<C>__{disciple prospect}
<D>__{i just need to use the phone, lady.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{oh, let me get out of your way then.}
<C>__{disciple prospect}
<D>__{what happened? did you lose your keys?}
<C>__{marian}
<P>__{(withdrawing anxiously)}
<D>__{have a nice day.}
<A>__{wide shot marian walks quickly across the frame. as she exits right, the disciple prospect enters left and trails after her.}
