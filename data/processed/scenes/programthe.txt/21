<L>__{exterior the 911 night}
<A>__{college hang out, bar, catering to athletes and their admirers. a black harley davidson, driven by joe kane with darnell on the back, pulls up at the curb. they get off, head inside.}
<L>__{interior the 911 night}
<A>__{joe and darnell pass a table of three girls, conspicuous among them is louanne winters. joe and darnell give her a nod and proceed on to a table where three fellow players wait: bud lite, bobby collins, good looking, silver tongued ladies man and 2nd string quarterback, and steve lattimer, heavily muscled, surf punk defensive end. between them is a large pitcher of beer.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{uh, oh, the lead dog is back. there goes my cover of the media guide.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{hey, bobby, lats, how ya doin? this is darnell jefferson, freshman tailback.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{how ya' doin'?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i was hopin' you'de have rolled your bike or somethin'. nothin' serious, just enough to keep you out for the season.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(pouring himself some beer)}
<D>__{no such luck, backup man. but i will try to engineer a few blowouts. get you get some mop up time.}
<P>__{(studying lattimer)}
<D>__{shit, lats, you look buffed, man. you put on some weight?}
<C>__{lattimer}
<D>__{35 lbs. spent the summer in the gym. i'm tired of watchin' you guys play. i intend to start this year.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{you get any bigger, you can play offense.}
<C>__{lattimer}
<D>__{yeh, but don't i have to get dumber too?}
<A>__{bud takes a good natured swipe at him. lattimer deflects it. joe notices bobby looking over at louanne. she gives bobby a surreptitious little wave to come over and sit with her. he gives her the "just a minute" sign.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{you still seein' louanne?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{yeh. now and then, when the tide rises. don't want her to think this is some kind've exclusive deal.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{coach finds out you're nailin' his daughter, you'll be playin' dorm ball.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i will bail before that. besides, this is what he gets for not startin' me.}
<A>__{bobby laughs and heads over to louanne's table, as joe pours himself another beer. alvin enters the bar, goes to joe's table, plops a copy of sports illustrated down in front of joe.}
<C>__{alvin}
<D>__{hey, man, you seen this?}
<A>__{on the cover is a picture of joe and one other quarterback, tim waymen. the coverline reads, heisman hopefuls: the year}
<B>__{of the quarterback.}
<C>__{alvin}
<P>__{(ribbing joe)}
<D>__{you must be some very bad ass motherfucker.}
<A>__{joe stares at the cover. he's more stunned than elated.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{jesus...}
<C>__{lattimer}
<D>__{what? you didn't know?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i knew there was gonna be an article. i didn't know it was gonna be on the cover.}
<C>__{alvin}
<D>__{shit, we do all the work. you get all the pub. too bad we're not allowed to hit you in practice. be fun to kick the shit out of a heisman trophy candidate.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i guess you'll have to wait till we get to the pros.}
<C>__{alvin}
<P>__{(to darnell)}
<D>__{beer boy, get me some.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{are you serious?}
<C>__{alvin}
<D>__{does it look like i'm serious?}
<A>__{joe drains his beer, pours another. lattimer starts to read form the article.}
<C>__{lattimer}
<D>__{listen to this. "e.s.u. has a solid nucleus returning, but the timberwolves, coming off two disappointing seasons, will only go as far as the strong right arm of heisman candidate joe kane will take them." that right, joe? you gonna lead us to the promised land?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i'm gonna lead... but can you follow?}
<A>__{muted chuckles, but set faces. the challenge accepted. joe chugs his beer, pours another.}
