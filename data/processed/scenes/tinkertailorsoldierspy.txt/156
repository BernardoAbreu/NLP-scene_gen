<A>__{guillam is walking to the lifts, we note he is now carrying his bag. behind him roy bland is walking down the corridor. he peels off, turning left, humming a tune to himself the same pop song that was playing at the garage in the background of guillam's call. guillam reacts as he keeps on walking, trying to work out if this means something. we track with him as his anger and paranoia grow.}
