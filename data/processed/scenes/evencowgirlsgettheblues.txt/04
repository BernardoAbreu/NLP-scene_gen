<L>__{interior school library day}
<A>__{sissy looks up "thumb" in the dictionary. it says: the short, thick first or most preaxial digit of the human hand, differing from the other fingers by having two phalanges and greater freedom of movement. sissy mouthing the words: "greater freedom of movement."}
<L>__{exterior road day}
<A>__{sissy very timidly ventures a pass with her gigantic right thumb in the direction she is walking. she is passed by...... but no! brake lights! a pontiac skids ever so slightly on the snowflakes. view of the pontiac insignia on the hood of the car. sissy runs, actually sweating, to its side. she peers in. outside a palmist's trailer is a sign with a red silhouette of a hand. directly under the wrist where the watch band would be is written madame zoe. madam zoe in kimono and wig lets sissy and her mother in the door.}
<C>__{madame zoe}
<D>__{i am the enlightened madame zoe.}
<A>__{inside. madame zoe begins stubbing a cigarette in one of those enlightened little ceramic ashtrays that are shaped like bedpans and inscribed butts. the trailer is cluttered, but not one knick knack, chintz curtain or chenille covered armchair seems to have come from the beyond.}
<C>__{madame zoe}
<D>__{there is nothing about your past, present or future that your hands do not know, and there is nothing about your hands that madame zoe does not know. there is no hocus pocus involved. i am a scientist, not a magician. i, madame zoe, chiromancer, lifelong student of the moldings and markings of the human hand. i, madame zoe, to whom no facet of your character or destiny is not readily revealed. i am prepared to...}
<A>__{then she notices the thumbs.}
<C>__{madame zoe}
<D>__{jesus fucking christ!}
<A>__{mrs. hankshaw and the fortune teller turn pale and uncertain, while sissy recognizes with a faint smile that she is in command. sissy extends the thumbs as an ailing aborigine might extend his swollen parts to a medical missionary. sissy's mama draws a neatly folded five dollar bill from her change purse and extends it alongside her smiling daughter's extremities. madame zoe returns to her senses, and takes sissy by the elbow to sit at a for mica topped table of undistinguished design. madam zoe holds sissy's hands while she appears to go into a trance. she opens her eyes momentarily.}
<C>__{madame zoe}
<D>__{you have a strong will. will power and determination are indicated by the first phalanx. the second phalanx indicates reason and logic. you obviously have both in large supply. what's your name, dearie?}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{sissy.}
<C>__{madame zoe}
<D>__{hmmm. i'd say that you have an intelligent, kindly, somewhat artistic nature. however, sissy, however, there is a heavy quality to the second phalanx the phalanx of logic that indicates a capacity for foolish or clownish behavior, a refusal to accept responsibility or to take things seriously and bent to be disrespectful of those who do. your mama tells me that you're pretty well behaved and shy, but i'd watch out for signs of irrationality. all right?}
<A>__{she pulls her thumb to her breast.}
<C>__{madame zoe}
<D>__{i guess the most important aspect of your thumbs is the, ahem, over all size. uh, what was it, do you know, that caused...?}
<A>__{mom speaks out from the couch she is sitting on}
<C>__{mrs hankshaw}
<D>__{don't know; the doctors don't know...}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{just lucky i guess.}
<C>__{madame zoe}
<D>__{do you study history in school? galileo, descartes, newton? lebinitz had very large thumbs; voltaire's were enormous, but, heh heh, just pickles compared with yours.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{what about crazy horse?}
<C>__{madame zoe}
<D>__{crazy horse? you mean the indian? nobody that i've ever heard of ever troubled to study the paws of savages. well, i guess that about covers the three fifty charge...}
<A>__{madame zoe lets go of sissy's thumbs and wipes her hands on her kimono.}
<C>__{mrs. hankshaw}
<D>__{husband.}
<A>__{mrs. hankshaw withdraws a bill from her rat skin bag.}
<C>__{madame zoe}
<D>__{beg your pardon?}
<C>__{mrs. hankshaw}
<D>__{husband. will she find a husband?}
<C>__{madame zoe}
<D>__{oh, i see.}
<A>__{madame zoe takes sissy's hand and gives it the old tall dark stranger squinterior}
<C>__{madame zoe}
<D>__{i see men in your life, honey. i also see women, lots of women.}
<A>__{she raises her eyes to meet sissy's looking for an admission of the "tendency", but there is no signal. mrs. hankshaw does not approve.}
<C>__{madame zoe}
<D>__{a husband, no doubt about it, though he is years away. there are children, too. five, maybe six, but the husband is not the father. they will inherit your characteristics.}
<A>__{mrs. hankshaw, aghast, has heard plenty, and she ushers her daughter out of the trailer as if she were leading her from a burning cocktail lounge.}
