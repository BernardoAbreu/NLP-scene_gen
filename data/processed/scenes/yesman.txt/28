<T>__{match cut to:}
<L>__{interior holiday inn conference room}
<A>__{a banner across a stage that has a photo of the same indian man smiling beatifically. we pan down to find carl among the crowd. carl sits down next to a wiry, crunchy woman.}
<D>__{wiry, crunchy woman is this your first time at one of sanji's lectures?}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(scoffing)}
<D>__{uh, yeah.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{have you been to this before? wiry, crunchy woman only like fifty eight times. sanji's a genius. like seriously... he will blow your mind all over the goddamn room. he's like a mind grenade.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i don't know if i want that. wiry, crunchy woman oh you do not. but you need it. and that's why you are here.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{cool. do you want anything from the refreshment area? wiry, crunchy woman you kidding? that processed shit will kill you faster than a pleasure cruise to chernobyl.}
<A>__{carl heads over to the refreshment table. once he's out of her sight, he sits down alone in a corner of the conference room. ethereal music begins to play over the loudspeakers. people begin to sit. carl sits down in the back.}
<C>__{sanji }
<D>__{life. we are all living it.}
<A>__{carl laughs. no one else does. the lights get rosier.}
<D>__{sanji (v.o.) (cont'd) or are we? change doesn't start on the surface. it's generated from consciousness. but where is consciousness generated from?}
<A>__{carl looks around. everyone is nodding along with it.}
<C>__{sanji }
<D>__{from the external. and the external is manipulated through our choices. and our choices start with one word.}
<A>__{the music abruptly switches to the opening beats of "jump" by the pointer sisters. the rosy colored lights flip to bright white and sweep across the convention center room. it is suddenly like a rock concert. sanji (50s) busts through the giant banner. the whole crowd starts cheering.}
<C>__{sanji }
<D>__{yes!}
<A>__{instead of "jump", sanji's yelling "yes!"}
<C>__{sanji }
<D>__{say yes! for your life! yes! change starts now! yes! yes! yes! say it with me! say yes!}
<A>__{sanji pumps his fist in the air as lame indoor fireworks go off. the crowd jumps on their feet.}
<C>__{sanji }
<D>__{are you ready to open the door to yes?}
<C>__{crowd}
<D>__{yes!}
<C>__{sanji}
<D>__{i am sorry, my friends. but i cannot hear you?}
<C>__{crowd}
<D>__{yes!}
<C>__{sanji}
<D>__{shhhhhhh.}
<A>__{the crowd quiets.}
<C>__{sanji }
<D>__{now is the time when we must greet our new members. who here is new? please, do not be shy. wiry, crunchy woman he is!}
<A>__{the woman points at carl. the spotlight swings over to carl. he is annoyed.}
<C>__{sanji}
<D>__{come on up, future yes man!}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{that's ok. i'm just auditing.}
<C>__{sanji}
<D>__{you can't audit life! now get on up here!}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i'm cool right here.}
<C>__{sanji}
<D>__{then i will come to you!}
<A>__{sanji runs off the stage and joins carl in the back of the conference hall. the spotlights follow him.}
<C>__{sanji }
<D>__{what is your name?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{carl.}
<C>__{sanji}
<D>__{let me guess, carl. this was not your idea to come here, carl.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i wouldn't say that.}
<C>__{sanji}
<D>__{you can tell me, carl. we are all alone, carl.}
<A>__{the crowd laughs.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{it wasn't exactly my idea.}
<C>__{sanji}
<D>__{that's what i thought, carl. and you think this is all bullshit, carl, isn't that right, carl?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{honestly?}
<C>__{sanji}
<D>__{is there any other way?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{this whole thing seems retarded.}
<C>__{sanji}
<D>__{but you are stuck in your life, carl? am i right?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i wouldn't necessarily }
<C>__{sanji}
<D>__{you once had a dream? you wanted to own a boat? a house? a fancy car? you wanted to a doctor, a lawyer... a business man?}
<A>__{carl nods, surprised at sanji's incisiveness.}
<C>__{sanji }
<D>__{you wanted to be more than you are. and yet you have suddenly woken up to find life is passing you by. am i right, carl?}
<A>__{sanji's suddenly getting to carl. as sanji talks to him, the moment between them becomes more and more intimate. it should feel like the rest of the crowd has disappeared.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{a little.}
<C>__{sanji}
<D>__{it's odd that ten years can pass just like that.}
<A>__{sanji snaps.}
<C>__{sanji }
<D>__{isn't it, carl?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{it is.}
<C>__{sanji}
<D>__{i want you to do something for me, carl. tomorrow, i want you only to say yes. can you do that for me? for one day, carl?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i'm not sure }
<C>__{sanji}
<D>__{please, carl. do it for me and you will be doing it for yourself. if you don't have the best day in ten years then i am the uncle of a monkey. will you do it for me carl? just for a day?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{yes?}
<A>__{sanji grabs carl hand and pulls him to his feet. we pull back and the crowd cheers.}
<C>__{sanji}
<D>__{welcome to the world of yes!}
<A>__{fireworks and confetti go off. the wiry, anxious woman gives carl a creepy thumbs up.}
