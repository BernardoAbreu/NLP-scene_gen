<L>__{14.interior mixter's office continuous}
<A>__{lisa stands in the office. mixter enters and shuts the door.}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{please, take a seat.}
<A>__{lisa sinks into a chair next to a large oak desk. mixter walks to the opposite side and sits in a large leather chair facing her.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i've uh... brought my resume and some references. i know i already sent a copy with my application but just in case.}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{mixter takes the file from her and opens it on his desk. he glances over it.}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{very good. i see you've had lots of experience cleaning private homes.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{yes, i uh... i've done a lot of them.}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{well an institution such as this one is a very different proposition.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{oh yes. yes i know. you'll see i've also worked cleaning a school, so i am used to big areas.}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{yes i've seen that. when i say this is a different proposition i mean in terms of the sensitivity required due to the nature of what we do here.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{oh yes, yes of course.}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{you would mainly be working night shifts at a time when patients are on lock down. but many of our patients here have psychological disturbances so there may be situations where you have to clean up things you may not be used to cleaning up. if you know what i'm saying.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i know what you mean, yes.}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{would that bother you?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{it may be strange at first but i actually have some experience in}
<A>__{that area. i would clean my mother when she lost control of her bodily functions during her illness. it's something i got used to very quickly. it became routine.}
<C>__{mixter}
<A>__{i see. how is your mother now?}
<C>__{lisa}
<A>__{well... she passed away.}
<C>__{mixter}
<A>__{i'm sorry to hear that. so... it's important to me that every employee here, whether they are a psychiatrist, an orderly or a cleaner, needs to fully understand what our mission statement at this hospital is.}
<C>__{lisa}
<A>__{okay.}
<C>__{mixter}
<A>__{high hopes was only built two years ago and as an institution we have only been running for just over a year now. so we're still building our reputation. but i am very clear on what i want that reputation to be. i intend to make this institution one of the foremost centres for mental health treatment in the country. if you look into my history you'll know that i have a stellar reputation in the field of psychiatry and i want to use that to help others. that is why i have put my own money into the creation of this institution. we are only just starting out but we have a long term ambition to be considered the best. so what i require is that every person who works at this institution, in any capacity, must be professional and sensitive to the needs of the patients. unlike other institutions, the welfare and care of our patients comes first here.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i really admire that and i promise i would not let you down if i was given this job.}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{i'm sure you wouldn't.}
<A>__{lisa's face quickly contorts. mixter looks puzzled. suddenly lisa sneezes. it shoots out so rapidly she has no time to cover her mouth and nose. she sneezes all over mixter. lisa looks horrified.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{oh my god, i'm so sorry!!}
<A>__{lisa rushes to mixter's side and grabs a tissue from a kleenex box on his desk. she frantically wipes the saliva and snot from his face.}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{it's quite alright, please sit down, i can take care of it.}
<A>__{lisa, completely mortified, sits back down. an unimpressed mixter wipes the spittle off his face with a tissue. when he's done he stares at lisa.}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{okay... well thanks for coming in. i will let you know.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{look i'm so sorry, i really am!}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{it's fine. we'll be in touch.}
<A>__{such is her embarrassment, lisa can't get out of the office fast enough.}
