<A>__{the grand hesketh estate in the northamptonshire countryside.}
<L>__{interior hesketh racing workshops easton neston day}
<A>__{james is in the workshops, his hands and arms filthy, he's been working on the car but now his eyes are closed. memorizing tracks. around him people are working on the car..}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{....along the beau rivage, long left into massenet, into the short right of casino. sharp right into mirabeau, then sharp left into loews, mind the guard rails...}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{is alexander around..?}
<A>__{james opens his eyes to see an endless pair of legs, a drop dead gorgeous figure, and the beautiful smiling face of suzy miller, the most successful model of the day.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{he was. then went to the house to take a call. he'll be back shortly.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{only he wanted to show off his pride and joy...}
<A>__{suzy indicates the car...}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{...rhymes with `boy' if you ask me. and `toy'. i can't believe what i'm seeing.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{it's just so small! for something that costs so much. and so flimsy. there's no comfort. no protection. nothing.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{no. just a little coffin, surrounded by high octane fuel, being driven round at 170 miles per hour..}
<C>__{james }
<P>__{(becoming grave)}
<D>__{to all intents and purposes a bomb. on wheels.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{why don't they make it safer?}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{no one wants it to be. it's like saying why not make bullfighting safer? it's a blood sport. the risk of death turns people on. without it, i guess, it'd be half the fun. which is fine for the voyeurs, fine for tv, fine for everyone..}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{...except us drivers.}
<A>__{suzy looks james up and down. sees the bare feet, the rock star good looks...}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{you're james, aren't you?}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{thought so. you fit the description.}
<P>__{(shaking hands)}
<D>__{suzy. friend of alex's.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{i know exactly.}
<A>__{in the background: one of the mechanics shows doc a picture of suzy from a tabloid newspaper. she's clearly the most famous model in britain, and a star in her own right...}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{what was the description?}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{mostly positive in terms of appearance. negative only in terms of character. i've been told to avoid you.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{by whom?}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{alex. he says you're a bad boy.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{was. not any more. new me very professional. early to bed. early to rise. all very dull.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{round the clock work, practise and focus. tedious, but apparently the only way to vin against ze goosestepper..}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{is that what you were doing when you came in?}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{visualization techniques. memorizing the circuit, in this case monaco, which is next up. eyes closed, know your way round in your sleep...}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{i know...i've always been a great believer in getting there on the day, putting the old foot down and playing chicken with everyone else.}
<A>__{suzy laughs..}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{but they don't want me to do that anymore...they want my body like a temple. my mind like monk.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{and your soul? your heart?}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{you can't be so disciplined in all areas of your life, can you..?}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{they want me to stop messing around, get married and settle down with the next nice girl i meet. they think it would be good for me.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{sounds bloody awful.}
<A>__{suzy laughs again...}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{but since they're right about most things, they're probably right about that, too.}
<A>__{james looks suzy up and down...}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{you don't fancy getting married, do you?}
