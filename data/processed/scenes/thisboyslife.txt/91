<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{and i know damn well you did.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{well, you're wrong.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{about some things, yeah. not about this. you're a goddam hog, and i proved it.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{how do you know skipper didn't eat it? or norma? or pearl?}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{i told all three of them to stay away from this candy for twenty four hours.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{well, how do you know i even ate any?}
<C>__{dwight}
<P>__{(a triumphant smile)}
<D>__{i counted them. you hogged down eleven chocolate covered cherries since yesterday afternoon.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{so what?}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{so that makes you a hog. i just wanted to establish that fact, and now i have.}
<A>__{caroline and skipper enter, carrying throw pillows and materials.}
<C>__{dwight}
<P>__{(to caroline and skipper)}
<D>__{hey. mr. hotshot hog and i've just been establishing some facts, and what we come up with is this: one, he's a pig who gobbles down everybody's candy; two, he lies about it; three, he lays around on his lazy ass day and night reading, reading; and four, he's not getting any ten dollar gym shoes. that's about what we've come up with so far.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{oh, dad...}
<C>__{dwight}
<P>__{(a high, mincing voice)}
<D>__{oh, dad!}
<A>__{skipper leaves the room. caroline sits down, begins to try various materials as coverings for the pillows.}
<C>__{toby}
<P>__{(to caroline)}
<D>__{why don't you ever take up for me?}
<C>__{dwight}
<P>__{(to caroline)}
<D>__{why don't you ever help me straighten that boy out?}
<A>__{caroline doesn't even look up. she threads a needle and begins to sew. whilst dwight paces around the room.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{all he does is read or listen to records or sing.}
<C>__{dwight }
<P>__{(he sings five seconds}
<D>__{of a grotesque}
<P>__{"blue monday")}
<D>__{i'm so sick of that shit! and when he isn't singing, he's watching t.v.}
<P>__{(to toby)}
<D>__{and don't say you don't 'cause when i come home i always put my hand on top of it to see if it's warm, and it always is. this is the news, kid i'm wise to you.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{oh, big, big deal, who cares, and as long as we're passing out news here, i don't want to do my paper route anymore.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{i bet you don't big lazy candy hog like you'd rather lay on his ass and read, wouldn't you? let me tell you something: you're gonna deliver those papers if i have to walk behind you with a horsewhip ever' step of the way.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{then give me the money i earn!}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{hell, no. i'm putting that in the bank for you for when you really need it cuss me now, thank me later.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{mom, won't you at least make him let me have the shoes for gym? how can i play basketball without gym shoes? i'm the only one who }
<A>__{toby stops suddenly. he looks at dwight for a beat or two, and then speaks in a different tone:}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{it's not the shoes, is it? or the candy. it's me, isn't it? you just can't stand the fact of me.}
<A>__{dwight glances at caroline, who still looks at her sewing.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{i, well, no, it's not that i just want you to be well behaved. your rich daddy 'duke' doesn't care anything about you, and so somebody's got to train you, and one of the things you've gotta be trained about is not to be a hog and eat everybody's candy like a }
<A>__{dwight stops short as caroline says one word.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{dwight and toby glance at each other nervously. what is this?}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(her eyes still on her sewing; soft)}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{what's the matter, honey?}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{toby dwight}
<A>__{are you sick, mom? don't you feel good?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{oh h h h!}
<A>__{a furious caroline raises her head, doubles up both fists, and yells.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i. will. not. referee.}
<C>__{dwight}
<P>__{(taken aback)}
<D>__{jack, i think you've made your mother nervous, so why don't we just go on to scouts and let her rest?}
<P>__{(to caroline)}
<D>__{you lay down and rest awhile.}
<A>__{dwight and toby grab their caps and hotfoot it out the door.}
