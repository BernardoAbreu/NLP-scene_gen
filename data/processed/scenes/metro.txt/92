<A>__{the explorer comes barreling toward it. spectators scatter. two squad cars screech up behind the barricades, trying to block korda's escape. the explorer plows through the metal barricades. bashes the squad cars out of the way. and screams off around the corner.}
<L>__{exterior street day}
<A>__{the explorer careens up an alley and bursts into the congested traffic of a side street. honk screech! a toyota swerves to miss it and broadsides a parked car. the explorer fishtails off down the street.}
