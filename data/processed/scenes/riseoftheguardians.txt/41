<L>__{interior tooth palace a moment later}
<A>__{a vast chamber supported by pillars containing millions of tiny wooden deposit boxes from floor to ceiling. north spots a nightmare up ahead and hands jack the reigns.}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{here, take over!}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{huh?}
<A>__{jack, though surprised, quickly grabs the reigns and smiles as he snaps them.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hyah!}
<A>__{north readies his sword and slices the nightmare in half }
<C>__{north}
<D>__{yah!}
<A>__{several tooth boxes spill out of the split nightmare and rain down into the sleigh at the guardians' feet. the nightmare disintegrates into black sand.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{they're stealing the teeth!}
<A>__{sandy looks at his hands and sees the nightmare sand take shape and drift away. he and bunny exchange a look. the guardians turn they're headed straight for a pillar.}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{jack, look out!}
<A>__{jack pulls the reins }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{aaaahhhh!}
<A>__{ the sleigh nearly misses the pillar and skids to a rough stop on a platform. they see tooth up above.}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{tooth! are you alright?}
<A>__{tooth is flying around, visibly frustrated. this is bad.}
<D>__{guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 47.}
<C>__{tooth}
<D>__{they, they took my fairies! and the teeth! all of them! everything is gone! everything.}
<A>__{only then does it hit her. tooth's wings drop in defeat. she's completely lost amidst the devastation. the guardians rush to comfort her. jack stays behind as baby tooth pops out from the hood of his tunic and flies over toward tooth.}
<C>__{tooth}
<D>__{oh thank goodness! one of you is alright!}
<C>__{pitch }
<D>__{i have to say, this is very, very exciting.}
<A>__{pitch's voice echoes across the open chamber. they look up to see pitch, standing high above them with a satisfied smile.}
<C>__{pitch}
<D>__{the big four, all in one place. i'm a little star struck.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{did you like my show on the globe, north? got you all together, didn't i?}
<A>__{tooth darts after pitch, but he escapes into the shadows.}
<C>__{tooth}
<D>__{pitch, you have got thirty seconds to return my fairies!}
<C>__{pitch }
<D>__{or what?}
<A>__{tooth follows the sound of pitch's voice and finds him near one of her tooth box columns.}
<C>__{pitch}
<D>__{you'll stick a quarter under my pillow?}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{why are you doing this?}
<C>__{pitch}
<D>__{maybe i want what you have. to be believed in.}
<A>__{jack takes this in. pitch moves along the walls and shadows of the chamber and emerges from behind a column.}
<D>__{guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 48.}
<C>__{pitch}
<D>__{maybe i'm tired of hiding under beds.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{maybe that's where you belong.}
<C>__{pitch}
<D>__{ah, go suck an egg, rabbit!}
<A>__{bunny looks down past the edge of the platform to find pitch upside down, staring him in the face. pitch disappears again.}
<C>__{pitch }
<D>__{hang on, is that...jack frost?}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{since when are you all so chummy?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{we're not.}
<C>__{pitch}
<D>__{oh good.}
<A>__{jack turns and sees pitch standing in the middle of a column.}
<C>__{pitch}
<D>__{a neutral party. then i'm going to ignore you. but, you must be used to that by now.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{pitch! you shadow sneaking rat bag! come here!}
<A>__{bunny goes after pitch, but he disappears and reemerges on an opposite column. tooth spots him, grabs one of bunny's boomerangs and flies at pitch in a rage...}
<C>__{tooth}
<D>__{ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!}
<A>__{pitch looks at tooth with a smile and before she can reach him, a huge nightmare darts out of hiding and rears up at her. tooth falls back. baby tooth hides in jack's tunic.}
<C>__{pitch}
<P>__{(soothing)}
<D>__{whoa! hey, easy, girl. easy.}
<A>__{pitch draws a wisp of black sand from onyx's mane, twirls it in his palm, and turns toward sandy.}
<D>__{guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 49.}
<C>__{pitch}
<D>__{look familiar, sandman? took me a while to perfect this little trick. turning dreams into nightmares.}
<A>__{pitch notices the shocked guardians.}
<C>__{pitch}
<D>__{don't be nervous, it only riles them up more. they smell fear you know.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{what fear? of you!? no one's been afraid of you since the dark ages!}
<A>__{pitch's eyes flash with anger. but then he smiles.}
<C>__{pitch}
<P>__{(nostalgic)}
<D>__{oh, the dark ages.}
