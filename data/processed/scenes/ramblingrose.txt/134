<A>__{a close shot of buddy. we hear the soft sound of rose weeping over the shot. buddy is affected, his flinty child's heart has been touched, but he is not quite ready to admit it yet. he is struggling with himself, trying to remain "cool" and not show his emotion. he frowns, moistens his lips, swallows. with seeming coolness, very much as in the scene with doll in which he deprecated daddy's stand at thermopylae, he shrugs.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{well, i don't know what you're worried about. it was my idea, i was the one who thought of it, not you.}
<A>__{the camera pulls back to include rose. she is staring at the boy with hopeless despair.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{you don't understand. they'd blame me, not you. and they'd think i was awful, a disgustin' girl, which i am, but buddy, please don't tell them. please don't. ill have to go and i love it here, i love your whole fam'ly, your daddy, your mother...}
<P>__{(pauses, then makes her}
<D>__{final and ultimate plea in a shaking voice as}
<P>__{tears run down)}
<D>__{buddy, i know i'm no good, i'm a bad girl but i can't help it, please have pity on me and don't tell! please don't, please...}
<A>__{too much for buddy, he loses his "cool." he swallows and blinks as if he might cry, then sits erect in the bed and squares his shoulders and assumes a stern expression daddy style.}
<C>__{buddy}
<P>__{(very solemnly)}
<D>__{rose, they could stick splinters under my fingernails, and i will never say a word! i will never tell them, because... i love you!}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(sees that he means it,}
<D>__{smiles in relief and throws her arms around}
<P>__{him)}
<D>__{oh, buddy, you do love me! i knew you did, knew it all the time...}
