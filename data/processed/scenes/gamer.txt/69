<A>__{music: bloodhound gang, the bad touch: ha ha, well now, we call this the act of mating but there are several other very important differences between human beings and animals that you should know about... you and me baby ain't nothin' but mammals so let's do it like they do on the discovery channel... pavement flies by... sun slams rainbow flares into the lens... roller skates break frame, outpacing us... we're cruising along with a group of young, beautiful people, skating like robots through a city park... roller dolly follows hot girls in daisy dukes, knee socks and tube tops, belly rings and tatoos in the small of their backs... athletic dudes, shirtless, gun racks and six packs... they swing their arms mechanically, identically... synced with each other and the beat of the soundtrack... each face plastered with an absurd, exaggerated grin... let's fucking party!!! we are in a super saturated world... not virtual animated, but absolutely real yet the color and immediacy of it is heightened, off kilter. on the grass, a gang of tokyo pop punk rockers are having a water battle, blasting and soaking each other with big plastic water cannons like something out of slayers... a redhead, soaking wet, is feeling up her own breasts, totally oblivious to her surroundings... one of the skaters, out of control, plows right into her at full speed... the skater takes a ride on concrete, grinding flesh off her bare legs... she wobbles to her feet, eyes streaming tears but still grinning ecstatically... a guy in a priest outfit holding brightly colored helium balloons looks on impassively; then spots something of interest and breaks off sprinting full speed... people are dancing the corniest moves ever... making out on the ground... and in the middle of it all...}
