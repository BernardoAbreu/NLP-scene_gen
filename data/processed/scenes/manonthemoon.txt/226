<D>__{what is that crap? looks like somethin' my dog would puke up!!}
<A>__{the women turn. it's andy dressed as tony clifton. a spooked moment. tony's wig, peach tux, and sunglasses are there... but andy is barely strong enough to bark out the attitude.}
<C>__{tony clifton}
<D>__{how 'bout me and you dolls go get some real food: french fries and a porterhouse steak!}
<C>__{lynne}
<P>__{(not sure what to say)}
