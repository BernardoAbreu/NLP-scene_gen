<A>__{arthur stops at a warehouse door. consults a piece of paper.}
<L>__{interior workshop continuous}
<A>__{a large, dusty warehouse. the sliding door cracks open. arthur enters. looks around, approvingly.}
<L>__{interior same later}
<A>__{arthur drags lawn chairs into the middle of the room. he erects a table. lays out several silver cases, unpacking them, laying out lines of tubing, mechanisms...}
<L>__{exterior parisian cafe day}
<A>__{cobb and ariadne sit at an outdoor table.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{they say we only use a fraction of the true potential of our brains... but they're talking about when we're awake. while we dream, the mind performs wonders.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{such as?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{how do you imagine a building? you consciously create each aspect, puzzling over it in stages... but sometimes, when your imagination flies }
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{i'm discovering it.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{exactly. genuine inspiration.}
<A>__{cobb leans forwards and draws on the paper table cloth.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{in a dream your mind continuously does that...}
<A>__{cobb has drawn a circle made of two arrows.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{it creates and perceives a world simultaneously. so well that you don't feel your brain doing the creating. that's why we can short circuit the process...}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{by taking over the creating part.}
<A>__{cobb draws a straight line between the two arrows.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{this is where you come in. you build the world of the dream. we take the subject into that dream, and let him 111 it with his subconscious}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{but are you trying to fool him that the dream is actually real life?}
<C>__{cobb}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{while we're in there, we don't want him to realize he's dreaming.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{how could i ever get enough detail to convince him that it's real?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{our dreams reel real while we're in them. it's only when we wake up we realize things were strange,}
<A>__{ariadne gestures around them }
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{but all the textures of real life the stone, the fabric. cars... people... your mind can't create all this.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{it does. every time you dream. let me ask you a question: you never remember the beginning of your dreams, do you? you just turn up in the middle of what's going on.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{i guess.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{so... how did we end up at this restaurant?}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{we came here from...}
<A>__{ariadne trails off, confused.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{how did we get here? where are we?}
<A>__{ariadne thinks, unable to remember. a faint rumble begins.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{oh my god. we're dreaming.}
<A>__{cobb nods. the rumble is building.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{stay calm. we're actually asleep in the workshop. this is your first lesson in shared dreaming, remember?}
<A>__{ariadne looks around, mind reeling. cobb braces the restaurant violently fragments, exploding and imploding particles of furniture, walls, people flying around ariadne wonders at the mayhem whirling around them cobb shields his head against the debris. she sees him }
<C>__{ariadne}
<P>__{(shouting over noise)}
