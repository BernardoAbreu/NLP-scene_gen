<T>__{fade to:}
<L>__{exterior desert evening}
<A>__{epps and jaeger are trekking as they have been doing all day. they look worn out, but they keep moving. jaeger is several paces behind epps.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{getting cold.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{it's a desert. that's what deserts do at night; they get cold.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{epps...epps! i'm gonna stop for a second.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{just let me rest for a second.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{we've got to keep moving while there's still light.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{you know what i'm going to do? i'm just going to take a second. i want to look at the gold.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{don't you touch it.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i just want to look at it. remind me of what i'm dying for.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{the deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{yeah, but we made that deal while wes was still alive. he's gone. time for a new deal.}
<A>__{jaeger takes the pack from his back and starts to open it. epps turns and races back to him grabbing him by the wrist and forcing jaeger to let go of the pack.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you listen to me. if,}
<A>__{if we get out of}
<D>__{this i don't care what you do with your share, but until then you've only got one thing to think about and that's staying alive. so you leave that gold alone, or you and i are going to have to have a serious talk.}
<A>__{epps waits for a response from jaeger, but gets none. jaeger's eyes seem to be glazed, and his stare fixed on a point well beyond epps. he raises a hand, points off into the distance.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{look.}
<A>__{epps turns and looks. off a ways is a light in the window of what looks to be a shack type building. epps stares at it as if it were the holy grail}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{what do you figure it is?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{place all alone like that? must be a boarder check pointerior}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{which boarder? saudi? kuwait? syria?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{couldn't be syria. we couldn't have gone that far north. it's got to be saudi. come on.}
<A>__{epps heads for the shack doing double time. jaeger puts the pack back on and races to catch up.}
<D>__{epps(cont} they've got to have water. we'll get same water, some directions, maybe they even have a vehicle.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{epps.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{we can head back for our lines, and they don't even have to know about the gold.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{epps. what if they're not saudi.}
<A>__{epps stops dead, now not more than one hundred meters from the shack.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{if it's a checkpoint, it could be iraqi.}
<A>__{epps considers this.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{we've got no cboice. either way, we've got no choice.}
<A>__{epps and jaeger keep on for the shack walking with apprehension now instead of running. epps stops less than fifty meters away.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{well, we should identify ourselves.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{yeah, i guess we should.}
<A>__{epps takes in a deep breath ready to yell to the shack. instead he turns to jaeger.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{even if they are iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile. got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war. they don't want any trouble.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{hell, they'll probably just surrender to us. probably.}
<A>__{again epps takes a deep breath. and again just as he's about to cry out he turns to jaeger.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{that's if the war is even still going on. way things were shaping up it's probably long over.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{probably.}
<A>__{epps takes a beat, then sucks in a breath. he yells for the shack:}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{hellooooo }
<A>__{before epps can even finish getting the word out machine gun fire erupts from the house and burns towards epps and jaeger. they dive for cover, hugging the ground as bullets whistle and ping through the space around them. they are forced back and down against a narrow stretch of rock, but it offers little protection and is chipped away by the hot lead. it's just a matter of moments before nothing stands before them and death. at the top of his lungs jaeger starts yelling:}
<C>__{jaeger}
<A>__{ashra ka mahari dahra sahib! ashra ka}
<D>__{mahari dahra sahib!}
<A>__{just as quickly as it began the shooting stops. from the shack we hear some chatter in arabic, then the door opens. a few men appear in the doorway. they laugh and beckon for epps and jaeger to join them.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i don't know. something wes had taught me. i think it means "don't shoot. we're your friends."}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{they must be saudis. it's a saudi checkpointerior oh sweet, jesus. come on. come on!}
<A>__{epps hurriedly stumbles in the dark for the shack. jaeger is just steps behind him. they enter the dimly lit shack to the good nature of the four men inside. epps and jaeger see a fire in an open hearth and go right to it to warm their bands as the four men go on chattering behind them.}
<C>__{jager}
<D>__{oh, man, this is good. what do you think the chances are they've got a whirlpool in this place?}
<A>__{as they rub their hands together epps looks up. he freezes. hanging on the wall is a very handsome, nicely framed portrait of saddam hussein. epps nudges jaeger who also looks up. he also freezes.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{oh, god...}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{they must have thought we were iraqi when you yelled to them. they couldn't tell in the dark.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{what are we going to do?}
<A>__{epps thinks. what are they going to do?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{slip out your m 16.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{and then what?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{and then shoot them.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i...i never killed anyone before. i told you that.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{well, you're going to start with a bang, 'cause you've got four of them to take down.}
<A>__{behind epps and jaeger one of the iraqis asks a question of them in arabic.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{can't you }
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i don't have a weapon.}
<A>__{again the iraqi asks the question. we can tell by the tone of his voice he expects an answer.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{don't go bitch on me now! you were going to kill me. kill them!}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i just said i would. i don't think i }
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{shoot them!}
<A>__{the iraqis sense that something is wrong. they move menacingly for their weapons.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{shoot them, jaeger! shoot them!}
<A>__{jaeger whips around at the same time pulling his m 16. he jerks back hard on the trigger spraying back and forth, back and forth. dig it: the iraqis do a death dance in the strobe light of the muzzle flashes. they do the twist, they do the jerk, then they all fall down. the bullets that miss do a nasty job of redecorating the place; shredding walls, eating up wood. jaeger keeps firing until his clip is empty. he stands huffing, eyes glazed like he's a million miles away from what he just did. epps steps up and takes the weapon from jaeger. that's like an alarm clock that brings jaeger back to the land of the living. jaeger takes one look around at all the carnage, then doubles over and gets to puking. epps just watches this pathetic sight. when jaeger is all done:}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{let's get some sleep.}
