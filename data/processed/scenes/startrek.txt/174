<A>__{uhura at her station, scanning for enemy signals all of our principals are here, in debate:}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{lieutenant, have you confirmed that nero is headed for earth?}
<C>__{uhura}
<D>__{their trajectory suggests no other destination, captain.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{earth may be his next stop, but we have to assume every federation planet's a target.}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{yes, agreed but why didn't they destroy us?}
<C>__{sulu}
<D>__{why waste a weapon? we weren't a threat.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{that's not it. he said he wanted me to see something. the destruction of my home planet.}
<C>__{mccoy}
<D>__{and how the hell did they do that by the way? when did they jump so far ahead in the arms race?}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{the engineering comprehension necessary to artificially create a black hole may suggest the answer: such technology could theoretically be manipulated to create a tunnel through space time.}
<C>__{mccoy}
<D>__{damnit, man, i'm a doctor, not a physicist are you suggesting they're from the future?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{that is what he's suggesting and i don't buy it.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{if you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains however improbable must be the truth.}
<C>__{mccoy}
<D>__{how poetic.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{then what would an angry future romulan want with captain pike?}
<C>__{sulu}
<D>__{as admiral he knows details of starfleet's defenses.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{what we need to do is catch up to that ship. disable it, take it over and get pike back.}
<A>__{they're all looking at kirk like he's nuts.}
<C>__{mccoy}
<P>__{(bitingly)}
<D>__{fantastic, i'm in.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{captain pike left us with standing orders to rendezvous with the fleet on the other side of the quadrant.}
<C>__{spock }
<D>__{we're technologically outmatched in every way. a rescue attempt would be illogical.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{"illogical" you're funny.}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{not to mention we couldn't do it anyway: nero's ship would have to drop out of warp for us to overtake them }
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{ what about assigning engineering crews to try and boost our warp yield?}
<C>__{spock kirk}
<A>__{remaining power and crew are being used to repair radiation leaks on the lower decks and damage to the main deflector shield without which we cannot communicate with okay okay, okayokayokay starfleet. there's gotta be some way!}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{we must gather with the rest of starfleet to balance the terms of our next engagement }
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{there won't be a next engagement, spock: by the time we've "gathered", it'll be too late how many planets are you willing to risk? you say he's from the future? knows what's gonna happen? then the logical thing is to be unpredictable.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{you're assuming nero knows how events are predicted to unfold. the contrary: nero's very presence has altered the flow of history, beginning with the attack on the u.s.s. kelvin, culminating in the events of today thereby creating a new chain of incidents that cannot be anticipated by either party.}
<C>__{mccoy}
<D>__{does anyone understand him?}
<C>__{uhura}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{... an alternate reality.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{precisely. whatever lives we might have lived, if the time continuum was disrupted... our destinies have changed.}
<P>__{(then:)}
<D>__{mr. sulu, plot a course for the laurentian system, warp factor three }
<C>__{kirk spock}
<A>__{ wait don't do that spock running back to the rest of the fleet for a confab is a massive waste of time these were the orders he also ordered us to go captain pike issued when he back and get him! spock, left ship you're captain now ! i am aware of my every second we waste, responsibilities, mr. kirk! nero's getting closer to his next target ! that is correct and why}
<D>__{i'm instructing you to accept}
<A>__{ i will not allow us to go that i alone am in command. backwards, away from the problem, instead of hunting then i must remove you from nero down! this ship. if i confine you}
<D>__{to the brig, you'll likely escape. mr. chekov: have transportation prepare a deployment capsule. mr. sulu, escort him out.}
<A>__{for a beat, nobody moves an impossible choice for all of them. torn, chekov and sulu close in on kirk }
<C>__{sulu}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{yeah, don't worry ab }
<A>__{ but kirk swings, sulu jerks, faster, spins, grabs kirk's wrist! kirk elbows him as chekov reaches for his phaser but kirk slams him, the phaser drops kirk reaches for it but spock's fingers clamp on kirk's neck: the vulcan pinch:}
