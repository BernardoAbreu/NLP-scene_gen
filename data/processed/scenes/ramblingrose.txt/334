<A>__{a shot of daddy and buddy back in the garage. they are scrutinizing a wooden ladder that hangs on pegs alongside the garage. all daddy needs is a cap and a pipe to be a dead ringer for sherlock holmes. he is in dead earnest about this, it is no joke and he does not dream of being funny.}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(points to ladder, eyes narrowed)}
<D>__{see, son? the paint is flaked off here, freshly. look at it, brother, there is no question about it. some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{well... maybe...}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{and there's only one reason anybody would want this ladder to get up into rose's bedroom in the dark of night! i am going to chain up this ladder and padlock it! and that is not all i am going to do!}
<A>__{buddy stares at him in apprehension.}
