<L>__{interior throne room day}
<A>__{the queen is on her throne, her huge abdomen sprawled behind her.}
<C>__{queen}
<D>__{ah! general formica.}
<A>__{formica salutes and marches to her, carpenter behind him. note: throughout this scene, the queen is giving birth repeatedly. each birth is accompanied by a herald playing a short "happy birthday" fanfare on his trumpet. mid wife ants bring each baby to the queen for inspection, who coos a few words. the midwives put the babies on a moving bassinet line, powered by ants on a treadmill.}
<C>__{queen}
<D>__{general, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...pains me. the thought of any of my children going hungry...}
<P>__{(she shudders; then, to baby)}
<D>__{who's the cutest widdle worker? you are! yes, you! don't forget to brush your teeth!}
<P>__{(to mid wife)}
<D>__{ship 'er out.}
<P>__{(back to formica)}
<D>__{what steps are you taking to remedy the situation?}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{we are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...}
<C>__{queen}
<D>__{yes, what else?}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{please don't worry, your majesty. leave the worrying to me. as you know, i'm not an ant of half measures. i don't pussyfoot around. this crisis is my number one priority, and i promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively.}
<A>__{the queen's attention is interrupted by another baby being put in her arms.}
<C>__{queen}
<P>__{(to baby)}
<D>__{no snacking between meals! off you go!}
<P>__{(to formica)}
<D>__{now what were we saying?}
<C>__{formica}
<P>__{(oliver north style)}
<D>__{i do not recollect, your majesty. will that be all?}
<C>__{queen}
<D>__{yes, general formica. carry on, my good man! i don't know what we would do without you.}
<A>__{formica clicks his heels and bows his head. carpenter bows low. formica smartly about faces }
<C>__{bala }
<D>__{general formica!}
<A>__{princess bala hurries through a second doorway, carrying a swatch book. something about her sets her apart from the handmaiden ants with her. her tiara, probably. formica tilts his head quizzically to carpenter behind him.}
<C>__{carpenter}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{princess bala, sir. your fiancee.}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{princess! you look outstanding. is there anything i can do for you?}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{well i thought since we're getting married...it might be nice if we...got to know one another.}
<A>__{formica looks confused.}
<C>__{queen}
<D>__{bala has always been a hopeless romantic, general.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{it's just that well, i'm honored that you selected me, and everything, i just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if we had a conversation?}
<C>__{formica}
<P>__{(uncomfortable)}
<D>__{conversation...yes...well...}
<P>__{(to carpenter)}
<D>__{wasn't she briefed?}
<C>__{queen}
<P>__{(holding up a baby)}
<D>__{look, general! a darling baby soldier!}
<P>__{(emotionally, to baby)}
<D>__{don't try to be a hero! just make sure you come back in one piece!}
<P>__{(handing it off)}
<D>__{next!}
<C>__{formica}
<P>__{(using the interruption)}
<D>__{i will take your suggestion under advisement, princess. in the meanwhile }
<A>__{formica turns to go.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{general we have to talk sometime!}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{very well. carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis a vis: relationship?}
<C>__{carpenter}
<D>__{actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule. we have thirty six seconds available right now.}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{outstanding. princess...?}
<A>__{bala's a little fazed...but grabs her chance.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{so, um...how was your day? what did you do?}
<C>__{formica}
<P>__{(scouring his mind)}
<D>__{well...}
<P>__{(that's it!)}
<D>__{i declared war!}
<C>__{bala}
<P>__{(sadly)}
<D>__{oh...and i was afraid we had nothing in common...}
<C>__{carpenter}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{fourteen fifty hours, sir.}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{duty calls!}
<A>__{he strides across the floor. bala watches him go, her antennae drooping unhappily.}
<C>__{formica}
<D>__{no squeak. outstanding!}
<A>__{we see through the now open doors into the throne room as formica and carpenter double time out of the frame. the queen sees that bala is unhappy.}
<C>__{queen}
<P>__{(sympathetically)}
<D>__{i felt the same way before i got married. confused. scared.}
<C>__{bala}
<P>__{(hopefully)}
<D>__{you did?}
<C>__{queen}
<D>__{yes but i did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings. the wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged. even marriage. you're lucky general formica is a paragon of anthood.}
<C>__{bala}
<P>__{(unconvinced)}
<D>__{yes...he's wonderful...}
<A>__{the doors swing shut on them revealing the two guard ants who were crushed in the wake of formica's exit.}
