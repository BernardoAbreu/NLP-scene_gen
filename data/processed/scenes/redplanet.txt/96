<L>__{interior observation sphere night}
<A>__{a billion stars, two very drunk people, half a beaker of moonshine vodka. she's talking about burchenal }
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{he's okay. i bet there's a hell of a girl waiting for him back home.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{three. and a horse. he really likes the horse.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{you're serious?}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{he pines for the horse. you?}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{i don't have a horse.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{that's too bad.}
<A>__{he takes another swig. offers it to her. she matches him.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{can i ask you something very personal?}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{it's about bras and space.}
<A>__{she looks at him.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{i don't wear a bra in space.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{bras are designed to hold your boobs in place on earth where there's real gravity. why would i need one in space?}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{cause it's really fucking distracting.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{you want me to wear a bra?}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{no. not at all. i'm sorry i ever brought this up.}
<A>__{the good news is neither of them will remember in the morning. much. another round. then }
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{do you have someone waiting for you back home? or a horse?}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{with the kind of jobs i've had, it's very hard to maintain any kind of relationship. so...no horses.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{or maybe you took those jobs 'cause you didn't want anyone waiting for you. or maybe...}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{no, i like horses just fine.}
<A>__{they've floated very close.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{you know, you're not who i thought you were at first.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{is that an insult or a compliment?}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{an observation.}
<A>__{they're very, very close. and very drunk. it's when he should kiss her. but he doesn't. the moment passes. they both know it was there and now it's gone. drift apart. feel stupid. damn.}
