<L>__{exterior indians' practice field late afternoon}
<A>__{players are filing off the team bus after the game. we pick up taylor, hayes and vaughn as they head toward the locker room.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{this is final cut down day, right?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{yeh, better get your snake ready, hayes.}
<C>__{hayes}
<D>__{no, i'm goin' cold turkey today. my hands are too screwed up to hold it anyway.}
<A>__{hayes reveals a pair of red and cut hands.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{if you're gonna use that head first slide, you better get yourself some gloves or you're not gonna have any skin left on your hands.}
<A>__{they've reached the locker room now.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{i don't wanna go in there.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{whatever happens, keep it to yourself until you're outta the locker room. don't celebrate in front of guys who just died.}
<C>__{hayes}
<D>__{what if we're one of the deceased?}
<A>__{taylor goes into the locker room. hayes and vaughn hang back. cerrano is already at his locker. he's got two snakes this time and some kind of voodoo head dress on. he sprays a patch of white paint on the locker door from a spray can, draws a symbol door. no tag. he kisses the snake, leaving some white paint on his lips, like a kid who's just had a glass of milk. taylor, exhausted from the game, lifts his latch and peers inside. he's made it, too. cerrano offers a hand. taylor shakes it and breaks a weary smile.}
<B>__{gentry}
<A>__{opens locker, slumps on stool. he's a goner.}
<B>__{hayes and vaughn}
<A>__{the two rookies, are still hanging back.}
<C>__{hayes}
<D>__{c'mon, vaughn, let's show some nuts here. if they cut us, we'll just sign with the yankees.}
<A>__{hayes strides manfully to his locker and pulls it open. this doesn't tell him much, however, because he's got his eyes closed. he stands that way a beat ot two, then opens one eye. seeing no tag, he turns and walks double time out of the locker room, as if he had to get to the john. he comes outside, turns a corner, and starts leaping around like a wild man.}
<B>__{vaughn}
<A>__{drawing strength from hayes, walks resolutely to his locker and whips it open. there hanging from the top hook is the "red death." vaughn stares at it expressionless, then slowly closes his locker.}
