<A>__{anthony runs down the sidewalk, cuts across the street, and goes around the side of the motel. he pulls off his jacket as he goes up the stairs. he spots inez's cart. he walks over to the room she's cleaning. she's in there making the bed. anthony closes the door and grabs her by her belt. she's laughing and he pushes her onto the bed. he unbuttons her dress. she jerks a sheet out of the way. it swings in the air. then we see anthony and inez walking down the sidewalk. he's got one arm wrapped tight around her shoulders and she's got hers around his waist. they're talking while they walk, going past people in the town. they watch each other walking reflected in a window.}
