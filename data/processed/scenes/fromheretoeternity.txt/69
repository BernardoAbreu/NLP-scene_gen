<L>__{interior choy's night}
<B>__{medium close shot old choy}
<A>__{an aged chinese, at least seventy five, old choy has a long white beard and wears a black skull cap and an embroidered robe. he is motionless, surveying the pandemonium which we hear over shot: the sounds of men laughing, talking and shouting blend with jukebox music blasting chattanooga, choo choo. young chop, old choy's son, passes; he is thirty, white aproned, bustling, americanized. camera pans with him, disclosing the small beer house; it has unpainted cement walls and a cement floor; the only thing that might be called decorative is the jukebox. the place is crowded with men from schofield, a raucous assemblage; everyone is drinking beer and the smoke hangs in thick layers. at a table near the door sit prew, maggio, clark, anderson, treadwell and mazzioli. at a corner table behind a forest of beer bottles and cans are warden, stark, karelsen and chief choate. group shot warden's table}
<C>__{stark}
<D>__{... china's the place. your money's worth ten, twelves times as much. i'm gunna ship over soon as my time's up in this pineapple army.}
<C>__{karelsen}
<P>__{(pinching beer off his nose)}
<D>__{the canal zone for me. this girl down there. she was a planter's daughter, see. she lived a very sheltered life. a very moral young lady, milt. i took her out to a high class dinner and then dancing. it was a great shock to her to learn about life. but she took it well. she got to like me very much after that.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{the last time i heard it you told it different.}
<C>__{karelsen}
<D>__{well, what did you expect? i was in a different mood, then.}
<A>__{medium shot prew's table maggio, anderson and treadwell are comparing snapshots from home, spreading them out on the table. mazzioli is talking to prew with great earnestness.}
<C>__{mazzioli}
<D>__{... it's in regulations. you've got a right to complain. you've got a right to take your case to the inspector general. any soldier has, even a plain dogface.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{i know it. i'm not complainin to nobody. they ain't goin to get the satisfaction of seein me squirm.}
<A>__{clark begins to play the bugle softly along with the jukebox music, noodling an uninspired obligato.}
<C>__{maggio}
<P>__{(pointing to pictures)}
<D>__{... believe it nor not, this is one soljer who's got a family look, fifteen of 'em.}
<C>__{maggio}
<D>__{see that old man with the handlebars?}
<P>__{(proudly)}
<D>__{mr. maggio is my father.}
<C>__{mazzioli}
<D>__{listen, prew. i guess i ought not to tell you but . warden hasn't had you on kp much lately, has he?}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{only my reglar turn.}
<C>__{mazzioli}
<D>__{well i was working in the orderly room this afternoon and i heard the captain telling warden you're to pull kp every weekend from now on. you know what that means you can' t even go into town }
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{whadda they want? they done everything, now they look me in a box! what else they gonna try?}
<A>__{clark hits a sour note an the bugle.}
<C>__{prew}
<P>__{(savagely)}
<D>__{when you gonna learn to play a bugle!?}
<A>__{in overwhelming, uncontrollable protest, prew slaps the bugle away from clark's mouth. in one motion he wipes the mouthpiece on his sleeve, raises it to his lips and blows his own wild, violent obligato to the jukebox music. full shot choy's as prew plays on, the bugle's pure tone pealing through the room. everyone puts down his beer, stops talking and turns toward prew.}
<B>__{close shot warden}
<A>__{reacting. he frowns, moved by the cry behind the music. medium close shot prew's table featuring maggio as he watches and listens, an exultation for his friend nakedly revealed on his face. another angle prew's table featuring prew hitting an almost impossibly high note, he stops as suddenly as he has begun. he has played perhaps fifteen seconds in all. he puts the bugle down on the table, embarrassed now, the violence gone, some of the wrath unloaded.}
<B>__{medium shot at door}
<A>__{the room is quiet for several moments, except for the continuing jukebox music, which sounds pale and thin now. fatso judson strolls in, stands at the door. some of the men see him, but no one greets him. fatso threads his way between tables as the room slowly begins to return to normal and the men turn back to their beer. medium shot prew's table as fatso passes. he stops, leans over anderson's shoulder to look at the snapshots on the table. he points to one picture, a pretty young girl of about fifteen, posing hollywoodishly in a bathing suit, cracks his knuckles loudly.}
<C>__{fatso}
<D>__{who's that? who's that dame?}
<C>__{maggio}
<P>__{(impassively)}
<D>__{my sister.}
<A>__{fatso whistles. he picks up the photograph, stares at it, whistles again.}
<C>__{fatso}
<D>__{whoever! say, she's a real good piece of whistle bait! i'd sure like to get my mitts around her.}
<A>__{he laughs complacently at his own wit, tosses the picture on the table, starts to move on, maggio rises, picks up the heavy wooden stool he's been sitting on and smashes it down on fatso's head with all his strength,}
<C>__{another angle}
<A>__{as again the laughing and shouting in the room stops abruptly. fatso reels a little with the terrible blow but does not go down.}
<C>__{fatso}
<D>__{why, holy i you hit met you hit me!}
<C>__{maggio}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{you bet your life.}
<P>__{(raises stool)}
<D>__{and about to do it again.}
<C>__{fatso}
<P>__{(still blinking from the blow)}
<D>__{what?! but what for? that's no way to fight!}
<P>__{(reaches hand to head, brings away blood)}
<D>__{why, you dirty yellow sneaking wop! you yellow little wop! if that's the way you want to play!}
<A>__{with his last sentence, fatso whips out a knife and snaps open the blade. the blade is at least five inches long. it glints evilly as he raises it. there is a concerted whisking intake of breath from the room. murder is clear on fat sots face. medium shot near prew's table (excluding warden) maggio, holding the stool high, backs up a few feet as fatso advances toward him. men sprawl away from them.}
<C>__{soldier's voice}
<D>__{hey, it you want to fight, fight with fists. take it outsides}
<A>__{there is a murmur of agreement from the crowd. a couple of men are about to rise. fatso whirls toward them.}
<C>__{fatso}
<D>__{i'm gonna cut this little wop's heart out. anybody steps in here, i give it to him first.}
<B>__{medium shot old choy and young choy}
<A>__{side by side. old choy watches, immobile, his slit eyes almost closed. young choy is shaking with fright.}
<B>__{medium shot fatso and maggio}
<A>__{fatso turns toward maggio, who circles back around the table as the other stalks him.}
<C>__{maggio}
<P>__{(scared but brave; shouts)}
<D>__{i'm gunna de brain ya, fatso! one step closer an i'm gunna kill ya!}
<A>__{fatso has his knife poised at his shoulder, ready to strike. warden comes into shot suddenly. he brandishes a beer bottle wildly, looks like an avenging spirit of authority.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{nobody's gunna do nothin! anybody's killin anybody around here, it'll be me!}
<A>__{warden snatches another beer bottle from a table, now has one in each hand. he steps between fatso and maggio.}
<C>__{fatso}
<D>__{look outs here, warden. this a private affair.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{no it ain't! this man's in my compny an i'm responsible for him. and you ain't makin two weeks extra paper work for me by killin him. nor him you. put that knife down!}
<A>__{he smashes the neck off one of the beer bottles, points the wagged edge at fatso, roars:}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{put it down!}
<A>__{fatso slowly lowers the knife to his waist, but keeps it pointed towards maggio and warden. warden deliberately turns his back to fatso, spits his words at maggio.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{killer! you unweaned punk& come on, you want some killing, come on!}
<P>__{(whirls on fatso)}
<D>__{come on, barrelbelly. ain't you comin?}
<A>__{neither fatso nor maggio moves.}
<C>__{warden}
<P>__{(with mammoth contempt)}
<D>__{killers! you'll get plenty of killing, all right. more than you got the stomach for. you'll be in a war one of these days. when you feel that lead from a sniper's rifle hit you between the eyes, come and tell me how you like it. killers!}
<P>__{(turns to maggio)}
<D>__{now put down that chair.}
<A>__{maggio puts down the stool. warden turns to fatso.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{throw that knife on the floor.}
<A>__{fatso drops the knife. it clatters on the floor. there is another audible whoosh of breath from the room.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{almost scared there wasn't anybody going to stop you for a minute, weren't you?}
<P>__{(finally lowers his voice)}
<D>__{is there any other little things you punks'd like me to take care of for you?}
<A>__{he drops the beer bottles on a nearby table, strides to his own table. the room settles back, still hushed. warden has broken the mood of certain death, but fatso, still facing maggio, bites off his words with sadistic, ominous venom.}
<C>__{fatso}
<D>__{tough monkey. hard sister. guys like you get to the stockade sooner later. one day you walk in there i will be waitin. i will show you a coupla things.}
<A>__{he walks away, drops into a stool at the counter. medium shot warden's table warden stands beside the table, watching. he seems satisfied as fatso moves away from maggio. still standing, he raises his half filled bottle of beer, drinks. medium shot prew's table maggio drops onto the stool, sidles it over to the table. he half whispers to prew.}
<C>__{maggio}
<D>__{i made a mistake i guess, but i don't see how i could of done anything else, after that big stoop said a thing like that.}
<A>__{prew leans over and picks the knife off the floor.}
<C>__{phew}
<D>__{i will tell you your mistake. you didn't hit him hard enough to put him out.}
<C>__{maggio}
<D>__{i hit him hard as i could. his head must be solid ivory.}
<A>__{in b.g. warden puts down the beer bottle and stalks towards the door. maggio and prew turn to watch him pass.}
<C>__{maggio}
<D>__{anyway, i'm glad he stopped it. he's a good man, you know it?}
<A>__{as if on impulse, prew rises and follows warden out.}
