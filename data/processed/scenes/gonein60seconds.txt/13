<A>__{and the light turns green ... and he pops the clutch ... and they are off ... it's a good old fashioned drag race ... kip smiles at the blonde ... mirror man is freaking out ... kip's eyes are on fire ... he clocks the speedometer ...}

<D>__{no way, man }
<A>__{yes, way. kip floors it. they bury the camaro in its wake... the gauge rising ... 90, 100, 110 ... mirror man is having an embolism... they warp speed by a police cruiser... both kids totally unaware of the police chopper up on high... with them in its sights ... and they drive ... at last, ending up at the waterfront a dark latticework of docks and wharves, warehouses and shipping crates... the freighters are somehow graceful against the moonlit water ...}
