<L>__{exterior park day}
<A>__{long angle...five swings in use. in four, the kids are pushed by moms or nannies. in the fifth, ben is pushed by annabelle. guess who's going the highest. pull back to... ...two women on a bench. under a starkly bare tree. jackie is drinking in the air, the cold, the day. rachel watching that.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{serene. you're getting the hang of it.}
<A>__{jackie doesn't answer for a beat. almost as if she hasn't heard.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{serene means you accept.}
<A>__{shakes her head.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{part of me hasn't quit yet. and the other part is still pretty outraged.}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{when it's not terrified.}
<A>__{watching the world of moms and kids. who are not terrified.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i'm thinking. do i know you well enough to really chew you out?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{jackie turns to her. diamond laser glare...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{have you lost your mind ?! you fought years for that job! and you quit ??}
<A>__{oh. that.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{it's just not the right time t...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{do what you've worked your whole life to do?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{it was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you mean, after i'm dead?}
<A>__{do you?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{hey, you haven't quit on you, i'm sure as hell not gonna. i just mean, i'm juggling a lot right n...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{juggle it! move the darkroom into your house. you've got that room downstairs with the treadmill luke never uses anyway. don't lose your confidence. don't lose your edge.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{it's the same choice you made.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{yes. i made the choice that was right for me. and i don't regret it. but even for me, there were days when i felt so lost, so invis ible. and then i'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.}
<A>__{reading rachel's face.}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(softer)}
<D>__{i know you, huh? the car pools, he measles, the pta. it's not gonna be enough for you in the long run. you have to think long term.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i just want to spend time with them when i'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{that's motherhood. that's the job, with or without a career. i'm telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness. they need you to be happy.}
<A>__{can you hear me?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{cause if you're not, the easiest person to blame is the guy sleeping next to you. and you'll push him away, and then hate him even more when he goes, until finally you have no choice but to leave. and that can't happen.}
<A>__{rachel's turn to wonder. she starts to say something, thinks better of it. asks instead...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{that's the bottom line, isn't it? i can't make a mistake. because it'll screw your kids.}
<A>__{glances over.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{my advice to you? don't die.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{feeling the pressure?}
<A>__{rachel's eyes move across jackie's face. then, out to ben, on the distant swings.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{last time i pushed him? he said, 'higher, rache. it makes my penis sting.'}
<A>__{thin smile. now it's jackie watching rachel's profile.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i'm gonna buy him that white dove for christmas. if i don't, you'll get him a fucking eagle!}
<A>__{jackie keeps watching her. and in a quiet voice...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{ben was born in two hours, went right to my breast and camped there for three days. always with this...mischievous look...}
<A>__{watches rachel nodding, absorbing.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that. he loves to hear that story, over and over. how he was born a magician.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(softly, never turning)}
<D>__{and her...?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{took 28 hours. she just wasn't sure about entering this world.}
<A>__{watches the feeling well in rachel's eyes.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{the doctor wanted to go in and get her, but i knew she'd come in her own time.}
<A>__{rachel nods. it fits.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{that's who she is. don't let anybody rush her.}
<A>__{silence. a murmur...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i will keep that in mind.}
<A>__{rachel settles back. her eyes now locked away somewhere private.}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{rache smiles. that jackie sensed something.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{it's not about the kids.}
<A>__{looks over. decides whether to ask...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{that thing you said before. pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. because of what you gave up for motherhood...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{is that what he told you?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{he won't discuss it. just calls it history.}
<A>__{a trace of edge to jackie's smile. but no real anger.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{well, he got that part right.}
<A>__{looking. looking.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{so what's the part he got wrong?}
<A>__{an urgency in that.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i got all day.}
