<A>__{an unparalleled set of sheer mountains part of the colorado rockies. the peaks rise a challenging half mile and more out of the valley wind whipped snow mists over the mountains like a low fog. the tranquility is broken as a helicopter blasts into view, fighting the wind as it heads for the center of it all. our credits fly us past and through this magnificent range. there are sky piercing peaks that slope up to a narrow, high pinnacle and others that are steel, straight up approaches to large plateaus. one of the mountains has a crystal lake on top with a waterfall that drains from it and exits from the middle of a mountain wall. nearby, an abandoned cable ladder is bolted into the same wall, leading to the top.}
