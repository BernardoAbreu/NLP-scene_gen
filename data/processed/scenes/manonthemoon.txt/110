<L>__{interior merv griffin show day}
<A>__{close up on andy and merv griffin. andy wears a goofy wrestling outfit that resembles thermal underwear. he is shouting like a wrestler.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{... and i vow to continue wrestling until i am bea ten, in a three minute match, with my shoulders pinned to the mat!!}
<C>__{merv}
<P>__{(nonplussed)}
<D>__{by a woman.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{yes! by a woman!}
<P>__{(emphatic)}
<D>__{i'm doing this because i feel that a woman cannot beat a man in wrestling. even if they train with weights... it requires a certain mental ability }
<P>__{(a clumsy pause)}
<D>__{and, uh i just don't feel they have that...}
<A>__{the audience murmurs uncomfortably. andy laughs and backpedals.}
<C>__{andy }
<D>__{no no! women are superior in many ways. when it comes to cooking and cleaning, washing the potatoes, scrubbing the carrots, raising the babies, mopping the floors, they have it all over men. i believe that!}
<A>__{an appalled silence. merv winces. some people start booing. we can tell andy is pleased.}
<C>__{andy }
<D>__{but when it comes to wrestling, forget it! if there's a woman that can prove me wrong, come up here. i will shut my mouth and pay her 500 dollars.}
<A>__{merv baitingly turns to the crowd.}
<C>__{merv}
<D>__{any... volunteers...?}
<B>__{wide}
<A>__{all the women's hands angrily shoot up! we move through the crowd, finally picking out... a feisty woman, lynne. she mutters, half hateful, half laughing }
<C>__{lynne}
<D>__{i wanna kill that jerk.}
