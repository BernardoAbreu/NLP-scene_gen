<A>__{expensive carriages fill the courtyard. the entire government is here. we see familiar faces from the temple of four orders, heading into this epic building.}
<L>__{interior sewers boat}
<A>__{tanner's boat, unlit, floats at the opening to the tunnel, on the edge of the darkness.}
<C>__{tanner}
<D>__{far as i can go.}
<A>__{holmes and watson leap off the boat into the mouth of the sewer. irene follows. (watson has his sword stick and a gun, holmes has changed into the clothes watson brought for him.) they move through the shadowy sewer tunnels, working their way around corners and through junctions back under the houses of parliament. holmes ducks around a corner, stops. irene and watson flank him, standing in shadows. they look down a long tunnel to: the area where coward and blackwood were seen in the flashback ceremony with the sword. but now: blackwood's thugs patrol the area. in the center, the pentagram remains. but there is something sitting in it, a futuristic device:}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{behold, blackwood's magic.}

<C>__{watson}
<D>__{you can tell that from here?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{no. i can tell it from here.}
<A>__{he pulls something out of his pocket: the rat tail.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i snipped this off a rather recumbent rat at the slaughterhouse. note the blue discoloration, the faint smell of bitter almonds. tell tale signs of cyanide.}
<A>__{he points at the device and the exposed shaft over it.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{that shaft leads directly to parliament. when activated, those electrodes on either side will send a charge converting the cyanide powder into a gas.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{all of the people inside that building }
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{will be dead at the strike of noon.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{as if by magic. there will be no one left to stop blackwood and his followers from assuming control.}
