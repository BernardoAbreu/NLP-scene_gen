<L>__{interior bar night}
<A>__{a typical port town bar. except this one is on an island in the middle of the bering sea. epps lines up a shot at the pool table as a couple of seamen check out her ass and a tattoo of wiley coyote poking out of her pants. greer reads a paper near by. murphy enters, crossing to the bar where dodge nurses a beer and a cigarette. murphy throws down an envelope with dodge's name on it. dodge picks it up, thumbs through a thick stack of hundreds.}
