<A>__{alice gets to the door and stops. she fiddles with the side of the screen... somebody has latched it. closer on alice, taking one look over her shoulder, kicks at the door, snapping the latch. another angle: as alice runs out into the rain, the mud, the thunder and the lightning. the theme is going full tilt as alice makes a quick turn to run towards the road. two shot: as alice bumps into an object which swings from above. a slice of lightning reveals it to be the dead body of steve christy hanging from the tree. a rope is looped under his arms, his head is down on his chest, and a long blade protrudes from his heart. reaction shot: alice in terror. another angle: alice runs and suddenly bumps into another pair of legs which swing from the same big tree. strobe shot: of jack, dead. another angle: alice runs for the arts & crafts. in the bg we see can the yellow slickered mrs. voorhees closing the distance between herself and alice.}
