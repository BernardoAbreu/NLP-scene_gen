<L>__{exterior space the enterprise}
<A>__{in earth orbit.}
<L>__{interior borg hive}
<A>__{angle on ceiling as the borg queen descends from her nesting place down towards the camera... ultimately stopping just a few feet away. she speaks directly to the camera.}
<C>__{borg queen}
<D>__{how do you feel?}
<A>__{close on data's hand his right hand is made of flesh it has color, fingernails, hair, sweat. it's completely human in every way. his fingers move slightly, and then the hand begins to rise. we follow his hand as it comes up and touches his face, which is also flesh. the gold color is gone, his hair is tousled and natural looking. even his eyes are real now blue. he touches his face tentatively, his expression confused... but intrigued.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{different.}
<A>__{the borg queen descends closer. data's arms are now free, but he is still restrained on the table. the rest of his body is still android, mechanical. data touches his two hands together, feeling the sensations, flesh against machine. he touches his face and lips, discovering himself in a totally new way.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{my internal sensors tell me the ambient temperature in the room is ten point two degrees celsius...}
<P>__{(wondrous)}
<D>__{but my skin tells me it is cold.}
<A>__{as he talks, we can see that he's becoming seduced by his own newfound senses.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{my visual acuity has been reduced by seventy eight percent... and i can no longer perceive light beyond the ultraviolet or the infrared...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but i can see .}
<A>__{it's an amazing moment, data riding a wave of feeling and emotion like he's never had before. the borg queen watches, pleased. she hovers close to him.}
<C>__{borg queen}
<D>__{until today... your emotions were trapped inside an artificial shell. you didn't know what it was to truly feel .}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and there's so much more for you to experience. i will guide you into a world of sensation unlike anything you can imagine.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{all you have to do... is give us access to your neural net.}
<A>__{data looks at her, suddenly shocked back into reality.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{no. i will not betray my friends.}
<C>__{borg queen}
<D>__{they're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{that is not true. they have tried to help me.}
<C>__{borg queen}
<D>__{have they given you what i have given you? did they even try?}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{i... do not want this...}
<A>__{but his words have a certain hollow quality to them. he is no longer as convinced as he was before and the borg queen notes this immediately. she reaches out with a hand and gently strokes data's cheek.}
<C>__{borg queen}
<D>__{you're becoming more human all the time, data. now you're learning how to lie.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{i wish to... go back to the way i was.}
<C>__{borg queen}
<D>__{more lies.}
<A>__{she slaps him hard across the face. data feels the pain , the shock. a small trickle of blood comes from his mouth. he looks at her in surprise, but before he can say anything she moves forward and kisses him on the mouth deeply and intensely. it's a disturbing and erotic moment. she pulls back. data reels, trying to sort out the rapid succession of pleasure and pain. her voice drops to a whisper and she moves even closer to him, face to face... seductive... beguiling.}
<C>__{borg queen}
<D>__{have you ever know a woman? do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{my creator did not intend for me to experience these things.}
<C>__{borg queen}
<D>__{i'm your creator now.}
<A>__{she rubs her body against his, cat like... then pulls him to her and kisses him deeply. off the image of their bizarre embrace...}
