<L>__{interior nite: nightclub (winter 1945)}
<A>__{luca sits at the bar of the tattaglia nightclub, as we remember him. bruno tattaglia had just patted his hand. luca looks up at him. then sollozzo pats the other hand, almost affectionately. luca is just about to twist his hands away, when they both clamp down as hard as they can. suddenly, a garrote is thrown around his neck, and pulled violently tight. his face begins to turn to purple blotches, and then totally purple, right before our eyes; his tongue hangs out, in a far more extreme way than a normal tongue could. his eyes bulge. one of the men looks down at him in disgust as luca's strength leaves him.}
