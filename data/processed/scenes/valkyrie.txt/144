<L>__{interior reichministry goebbels' office day}
<A>__{propaganda minister goebbels the most ghoulish of hitler's big six. his spooky, deep set eyes watch the action on the street below. already he can hear troops coming down the hallway. he takes a pistol from his desk drawer and leaves it within reach. then he picks up the phone and dials. after a beat.}
