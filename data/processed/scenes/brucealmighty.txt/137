<L>__{interior small wonder's day care day}
<A>__{grace is helping one of the kids, when she notices something outside the window. it's a cloud formation that strangely looks like bruce (in profile) holding hands with grace. she reacts as the imagery melts away into a very faint "forgive him."}
<L>__{exterior small wonders day care later}
<A>__{grace is talking with one of the other teachers. the kids, playing dodgeball in the background, laugh and scream louder and louder. grace turns and sees... bruce getting pelted by multiple balls.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{okay, surrender, surrender.}
<A>__{he walks over to grace.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{hi.}

<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{i, ah, have my first anchor tonight.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{that's great. i hope it goes well for you.}
<A>__{he's hit in the head by a ball. grace can't help but smiles bruce leaps at the opportunity.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{i miss you.}
<P>__{(off her silence)}
<D>__{i just took the first step, shot myself out on the ledge, awaiting vulnerably your response.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{. . . i don't know what to say.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{how about you love me and you'll take me back.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{no, bruce.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{come on, what about all the signs?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{what? how do you know about that? did you talk to debbie?}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{would it help if i told you i acted like an ass?}
<A>__{martin is standing nearby.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{hey, you said ass.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{it's okay as long as you mean a donkey. i didn't add "hole." it's only bad when you say "ass ho }
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{alright, inside, martin.}
<P>__{(to the others)}
<D>__{okay everyone, inside.}
<A>__{the kids race in. grace starts to follow.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{grace, please. none of this seems right without you.}
<P>__{(off her reaction)}
<D>__{is that a glimmer of hope i see?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i have to go...}
<A>__{she starts off. . .}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{wait.}
<A>__{bruce dramatically raises a hand toward grace, like putting a love spell on her.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{now how do you feel?}
<A>__{she looks at him, oddly.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{...are you out of your mind? have you been drinking?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{drinking? sure. i'm drunk with power.}
<A>__{bruce raises both hands in full hexing fashion...}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{...love me!!}
<C>__{grace}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{you need help.}
<A>__{she heads back inside. bruce throws his hands in the air, frustrated.}
