<A>__{dragon country day the unnerved citizens of swanscombe gather on the promontory overlooking galen's landslide. every few seconds there is a new shudder and more rocks pour down the long slope. valerian stands trembling with her father. presently brother jacopus elbows his way forward.}
<C>__{brother jacopus}
<D>__{listen to me, my brethren. the moment of our fear is the moment of our triumph. this is a sign from god. follow me, and our faith will send this creature straight to hell.}
<A>__{holding a cross before him, he starts up the slope. no one follows. they haven't been christians all that long. one or two near valerian get down on their knees and pray silently. greil looks things over.}
<C>__{greil}
<D>__{you call yourselves christians?}
<A>__{he strides after the monk. but he's the only one.}
<B>__{near the lair}
<A>__{the determined monk has arrived at the epicenter. his sandals are smoking on the hot gravel. sweat shines on his face and neck.}
<C>__{brother jacopus}
<D>__{the lord is my shepherd, i shall not want. thou makest me to lie down in green pastures. thy rod and staff they comfort me...}
<A>__{greil toils up the slope a hundred yards back. he's crossing himself, but he's carrying a sickle.}
<B>__{vermithrax}
<A>__{there is a thunderous noise. part of the mountain is tossed into the air. up from the depths comes a huge shining wing. then a neck uncoils and a head appears. it tips down toward the tiny human.}
<C>__{brother jacopus}
<P>__{(firm)}
<D>__{...for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen.}
<A>__{at the base of the slope the villagers scatter. greil wavers.}
<C>__{brother jacopus}
<D>__{unclean beast, get thee down! be thou consumed by the fires that made you!}
<A>__{the dragon's head sways back and forth, then belches out a waterfall of flame. it engulfs jacopus and sends him to a better world, if there is one.}
