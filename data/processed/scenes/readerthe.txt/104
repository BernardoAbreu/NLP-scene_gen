<L>__{interior lobby & courtroom. day}
<A>__{michael is alone in the now deserted lobby, unwilling to go back. then he goes to the door. he opens it a little. the sound of the trial. he opens the door fully. michael can see that it is ilana who is testifying. the court is conspicuously packed. large black and white photographs of the labour camp now dominate the room. michael comes quietly into the back of the room as the trial goes on. michael has pushed past a couple of people to sit down near rose who is sitting in the body of the court. he looks across to the defendants. rita beckhart, a large older woman, is one of a couple who isn't bothering to listen.}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{in your book you describe the process of selection...}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{yes. you were made to work and then, when you were no longer any use to them, then they sent you back to auschwitz to be killed.}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{are there people here today who made that selection?}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{i need you to identify them. can you please point them out?}
<A>__{ilana points with her finger at the defendants.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{her. and her. and her. and her. and her. and her.}
<A>__{the last finger has been to hanna. michael watches, but hanna does not react.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{each of the guards would choose a certain number of women. hanna schmitz chose differently.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{in what way differently?}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{she had favourites. girls, mostly young. we all remarked on it, she gave them food and places to sleep. in the evening, she asked them to join her. we all thought well, you can imagine what we thought.}
<A>__{hanna stares back, impassive. michael watches.}
<C>__{ilana}
<D>__{then we found out she was making these women read aloud to her. they were reading to her. at first we thought this guard, this guard is more sensitive, she's more human, she's kinder. often she chose the weak, the sick, she picked them out, she seemed to be protecting them almost. but then she dispatched them. is that kinder?}
<A>__{hanna looks back, not apologizing.}
