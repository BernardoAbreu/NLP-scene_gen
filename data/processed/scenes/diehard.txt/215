<A>__{outside the building same time signs of activity along the edges and shadows of the area. men and vehicles. the snap of weapons and breeches. footsteps running in unison. powell picks up on this, turns to robinson, who is standing with the swat captain, mitchell.}

<D>__{going in...are you out of your mind? there's 30 hostages in there for all we know }
<C>__{robinson}
<D>__{ all we know? we don't know shit, powell. if there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom? if there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands? all we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio!}

<A>__{inside the building, sadly realizing that the marlboro pack has only two more to go. he savors the dregs of his current number, then suddenly becomes aware of an almost eerie quiet. he moves to the window. his p.o.v. outside hints of activity in the darkness. a light flares extinguished. shadows move on trailer walls.}
