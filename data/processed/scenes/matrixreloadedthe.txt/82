<A>__{a wall of flame and fingers of tracers bursts from the skirmish lines. the tracers grow into a cone of orange flame bearing down on neo as we drop into bullet time. the bullets sizzle as tracers burn off their backs. the draw toward him like slugs. thousands of bullets fired at perpendicular angles close in on him. as they draw close to one another along almost perpendicular paths, they tinkle and chime and bounce. the bullets come to a stop, glowing as their tracers backs continue to burn. the world is in stop motion as the bullets stop, turn 180 degrees, and suddenly accelerate back at their origins. faster and fast they fly, until we drop back into real time. the skirmish line of troops is ripped apart by a hail of their own bullets. cu: machine gunner. with an m 249 saw, he blazes away at neo, only to be shredded by his own bullets. a private takes a shot at neo, and a bullet slaps into his shoulder. realizing whats happening, he drops his weapon. the soldiers are dropping like flies. the firing quickly subsides. neo stands alone in the center, unharmed. he turns to the skirmish lines. the surviving soldiers drop their weapons, and run. panic ensues. only a few officers, ncos, and soldiers too amazed to think of running remain.}
