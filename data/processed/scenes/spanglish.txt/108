<A>__{he indicates his watch then holds his fingers together.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{they should be back soon..}
<A>__{flor starts to cry. she sits in a chair..he sits not far from her.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{hey, flor..}
<A>__{embarrassed, she says, in spanish, to please leave her alone..she turns from him..he walks to the wet bar and gets a bottle of water...pours some..her crying soft in the background...he walks to her, sits near her and offers her the glass of water which she takes.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{deborah made a mistake. i understand how you feel...do you understand me at all, generally? is simpatico the word?}
<A>__{he pats her on the back..she looks at him..}
<B>__{close on flor..}
<A>__{is he coming on?..}
<B>__{her pov..}
<A>__{his kind eyes.}
<B>__{full shot..}
<A>__{this is real eye contact..two vaguely humiliated people finding real company for an instant. without thought, she duplicates his gesture and pats his back.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{simpatico, yes.}
<A>__{and when he seeks to add another pat, he misses, because she is out of her chair..(this is as intimate as john has been with another woman since he was married..) he calls out to stop her.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{un momento, huh?}
<A>__{she stops and turns to him.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{i'm really sorry this is happening. i just want you to know that. i am real sorry.}
<A>__{he taps his heart as an indication of sincerity then a flash of worry that he has inadvertently come on to her.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{i didn't mean..}
<A>__{he makes a gesture of ardent love..}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{i meant..}
<A>__{makes a person to person innocent gesture..she finds herself smiling.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{well, the good thing about being an idiot is that every once in a while you cheer people up..got to get to work.}
<B>__{camera stays with flor}
<A>__{as he exits...thinks about john's demeanor, smiles again, shakes it off as her mind fills with concern for cristina.}
