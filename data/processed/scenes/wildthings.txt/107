<A>__{the atlantic rolls before a long stretch of empty sand as the last red light drains from the sky. the range rover comes down onto the sand, parks.}

<A>__{kelly turns off the engine. suzie tokes on a joint, swills the md 20 20. she gazes upon the sea, eyes at half mast.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{i thought we were goin' to a movie.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i think we just need to get wasted.}
<A>__{suzie shrugs, gets out. kelly gets out with her. suzie staggers. kelly circles her with an arm, looks nervously around, begins leading her down the beach.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{i wanna live at the beach someday.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{she stops walking. suzie takes a few more steps then turns to look at her.}
<C>__{kelly }
<D>__{i left the keys. i will get 'em.}
<A>__{suzie plops down on the sand, drinks from the bottle. she watches kelly fading into the darkness, mumbles something beneath her breath, then lies on her back. suzie's pov the night sky the sound of crashing waves. she rolls to one side, looking down the beach murky blackness. she tries to focus, sits up.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{kelly?}
<A>__{she stands wobbly peers down the beach. a shape emerges in the blackness, moving toward her.}
<C>__{suzie }
<D>__{kelly?}
<A>__{the shape gets closer and closer, until... sam lombardo steps up to loom over suzie. she takes a step back. sam puts a hand on her shoulder. he carries something in his other hand hard to see on the dark beach.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{suzie, it's okay. it's me.}
<A>__{suzie steadies herself. a face appears behind sam kelly.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{i was worried about you, suzie. i decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{are you mad at me?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no, no. look, i probably should have told you a little more, about the part i intended to play.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we'll go through it all again tonight.}
<A>__{sam takes the bottle from suzie, looks at it.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{this is a celebration suzie, not a suicide pact.}
<A>__{he lifts the object in his other hand a champagne battle.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{we'll chill out first, have a drink, watch the stars.}
<A>__{suzie nods.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{kelly, there's a beach blanket in the jeep. could you get it for us?}
<A>__{kelly nods, starts back, looks once over her shoulder as... sam leads suzie toward a huge rock formation.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{let me tell you about this boat i picked out for us...}
<A>__{they move out of sight. kelly continues to walk, back along the sand toward the cars. insert a scream a sickening hollow thwack an arc of blood and two teeth fall silently on dark stone. kelly begins to run, stumbling through the sand to sam's jeep, where she pulls a big roll of clear plastic from behind the seats. she stuffs it under her arm, then runs back along the beach. as she runs, she can hear them more thwacks, moans it seems like forever sam appars before her on the sand. the champagne bottle swings loosely at the end of one arm. it looks shiny now, dripping with suzie's blood. kelly goes to him. she looks at the bottle, then throws herself against him a hard kiss.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm sorry, kelly. i'm sorry it had to happen like this. she was losing it...}
<C>__{kelly}
<P>__{(breathless)}
<D>__{there was no way. that cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. she was weak and dumb...}
<A>__{she kisses him again, her hands moving over his body. sam takes a step back, looks into kelly's face the parted lips, sultry eyes as if seeing her for the first time a long beat at which point he turns, heaving the champagne bottle as far as he can into the black waves.}
