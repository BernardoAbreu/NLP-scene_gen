<D>__{now i'mma show you the real "puff daddy."}
<A>__{he lights the blunt. craig's watching, so is suga. uncle elroy holds the smoke in for a very long time. maybe too long...'cause his eyes start to bulge, and he starts to toke (cough with your mouth closed). and toke. and toke. and toke. it looks like he's about to bust when he lets out a big puff of smoke. then he starts to cough, and cough, and cough out of control. craig and suga are amazed at this display. uncle elroy falls to the floor on his hands and knees. still coughing. he falls on his back and passes the blunt to craig.}
<C>__{uncle elroy }
<P>__{(still coughing)}
<D>__{it's the bombay.}
<A>__{craig takes the blunt and puts it up to his lips. he hits it, holds it in and looks at suga. suddenly, his eyes bulge out and he starts to toke, and toke, and toke, and toke. he starts to cough out of control and he falls next to uncle elroy who's still coughing. craig passes the blunt to suga, who looks at it for a moment and then looks directly into the camera. (as if to say, "shiiiiiiiiiiiit.").}
