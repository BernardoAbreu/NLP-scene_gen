<A>__{no response. jim walks into the kitchen, noticing a fresh baked pie on the counter. next to it is a note: "jimmy apple, your favorite. i will be home late. enjoy! love mom." jim sniffs the pie, taking in the aroma. then stops...as a quizzical look spreads across his face. after a moment of thought, he slides a finger into the pie. moves it around a bit, studying the consistency. then jim becomes more curious. we can see the gears in his head start to turn. he looks down at the pie like it's... well, not a pie.}
