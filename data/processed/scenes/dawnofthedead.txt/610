<A>__{in the other room, peter sits against a wall. he can hear the television. his eyes stare straight ahead at something.}
<C>__{scientist}
<D>__{i'm proposing that certain... necessary measures be put into effect at once... measures applying to all official search and destroy units, while they're still operative... hospitals... rescue stations... and any... private citizens...}
<A>__{the camera pulls off peter's face. we see that his rifle is stretched across his lap. the tv drones on from the other room.}
<C>__{scientist}
<D>__{in co operation with the mobile units of the o.b.p. the corpses of the recently dead should be delivered over to the authorities for collection in refrigerated vans... they should be decapitated to prevent revival...}
<A>__{we see now what peter is staring at. on the floor, twenty feet away lies the corpse of roger. it's face is covered with a blanket. it lies very still.}
<C>__{scientist}
<D>__{this collection... this collection...}
<A>__{the man's voice is heard almost shouting over the voices from the studio. the angry staff protests vigorously, with emotional language...}
<C>__{scientist}
<D>__{this collection could be... stored... rationed... for distribution among the infected society...}
<A>__{the shouts of anger continue.}
<D>__{in an attempt... in an attempt to curb the senseless slaughter... the senseless slaughter of our own society...}
<A>__{suddenly the dead roger's foot seems to move under the blanket. peter's eyes pick up the movement immediately. his hands tighten on his weapon.}
<C>__{scientist}
<D>__{the dissection... the dissection of the corpses can be carried out... carried out with respect for the dignity of the human body...}
<A>__{roger's arms seem to move, in slight twitching motions...}
<D>__{the heads... the heads and the ... skeletons... whenever possible... could be identified and... and buried in consecrated grounds...}
<A>__{the commotion in the studio reaches a fever pitch. from the movement beneath, the blanket starts to creep down off roger's face. peter stares with fascination and disbelief. the blanket clears the blankly staring eyes... the drooling mouth... roger tries to sit up peter's hands click a shell into his super gun. suddenly, the corpse sits up. it stares at peter, blankly at first, then with purpose... it starts to move towards the trooper who calmly raises his weapon...}
