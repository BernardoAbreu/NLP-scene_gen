<L>__{interior the lab}
<A>__{anderson enters the lab. the very building sickens him. what he sees sickens him even more. the remaining precog sits strapped into his chair. witwer sits beside him in the other precog chair, the dead brother at his feet. witwer wears the dead precog's helmet. his hand is in his lap, holding a gun. he grins when anderson appears. he takes off the helmet, drops it on the floor.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{i figured, since i can see the future, too, maybe i could get a little disc action going.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{just kidding.}
<A>__{anderson stares at his old partner. then he looks up at the digital clock. five seventeen am. witwer looks too, then turns back to anderson.}
<C>__{witwer }
<D>__{you find you been doing that a lot this week? looking at clocks?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{three minutes to go.}
<A>__{anderson turns to the tv.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{there's never anything good on, you know?}
<A>__{now witwer smiles.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{there. that's the old paul.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{you're not the old ed. you've lost it.}
<A>__{witwer rises from the chair, the gun in his hand.}
<D>__{witwer you lost it. you went weak in the knees, partner.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{i'm not your partner.}
<A>__{witwer looks at him sadly.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{the air went out of you when frank d'ignazio killed himself.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{he was guilty. i accepted that. witwer no you didn't. the doubts were creeping in on you. the lab trying to engineer more precogs ... malcolm pressuring you to expand ...}
<A>__{witwer reaches out and gently touches the remaining precog brother's cheek.}
<C>__{witwer }
<D>__{belief is the basis of the system. it was your job to be the ultimate believer.}
<A>__{witwer is breathing hard. he lifts a hand and wipes the sweat from his face.}
<C>__{witwer }
<D>__{and when frank died, you faltered. i'm a cop, i see into the hearts of men.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and the thing about you is, you wouldn't have just walked away.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{never been my style.}
<A>__{witwer gives him the flicker of a smile}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{precrime needs to grow. you would have stood in its way. the security panel wouldn't have understood that. what you're capable of. what a bulldog you are.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{look what you've been doing to us all week. amazing. you're the best.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{so you took matters into your own hands.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{i understood the threat. i understood you}
<A>__{anderson looks at the dead precog}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{you killed a precog. you ended the system you wanted to protect.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{wrong. this lab will make more. believe it, paul.}
<A>__{they look at the clock. five nineteen.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{knowing the exact moment of your death it's made you crazy, ed.}
<A>__{witwer looks at the tv. the tv reality is almost in synch with what is happening in the room. witwer lifts his gun and then realizes something is terribly wrong. anderson is standing there before him just as he is on the disc except there is a major difference.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{you sonofabitch!}
<A>__{anderson lifts up both hands}
<C>__{witwer }
<D>__{you didn't bring your gun!}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{that's right. no gun.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{you see?! that's exactly what i'm talking about. you don't believe!}
<A>__{anderson just looks at witwer, raging at him.}
<C>__{witwer }
<D>__{the system is infallible .}
<A>__{anderson doesn't seem to be witwer reaches behind him and pulls a second gun from out of his belt.}
<C>__{witwer }
<D>__{i guess that's why i've always carried two.}
<A>__{he tosses the gun to anderson. it clatters at anderson's feet.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{you can't have it both ways. you don't want to die. that's why you lured me here to kill me first.}
<C>__{anderson }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but it you don't diet the system is flawed, and you couldn't live with that.}
<A>__{witwer shoots him once, in the right thigh. anderson cries out, falls to the concrete floor.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{pick it up}
<A>__{anderson speaks through his teeth anderson it doesn't happen. witwer looks frantically at the tv, at the clock. he reaches over and opens the dripmeter on a piggy back iv feeding into the precog's main line. a thick, yellow fluid begins to flow toward the precog's jugular vein.}
<C>__{witwer }
<D>__{you're killing him, partner.}
<A>__{and what choice, finally, does anderson have? he reaches for the gun.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{let's not do this, ed witwer trains his gun on anderson. anderson trains his gun on witwer.}
<C>__{anderson }
<D>__{oh, ed ...}
<A>__{witwer lowers his gun. and stands there between anderson and the doomed precog. the yellow liquid has almost reached the precog's jugular. anderson shoots witwer, once in the heart. witwer is thrown back across the room, against a wall, beneath the clock. anderson drags himself to the precog, and rips the yellow iv out of the main line. the yellow drips onto the floor, mingling with witwer's red. anderson crawls to his friend, and cradles him. witwer whispers something, and anderson leans close to hear him.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{now do you believe?}
<A>__{anderson pulls away from witwer, and lets him take his last breaths alone.}
