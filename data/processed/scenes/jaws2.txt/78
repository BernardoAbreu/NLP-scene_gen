<A>__{the police jeep pulls up and stops; although the engine's shut down, brody still sits quietly inside the car. then his hand appears at the window, and he drops an empty beer can onto the lawn. clink. after a while, he drops another beer can, then another, until the "clinks" tell us he's polished off a six pack on the way home. not too steady on his feet, brody climbs out of the car and starts for the door to his house.}
