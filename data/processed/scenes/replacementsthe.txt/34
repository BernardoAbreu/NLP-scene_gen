<A>__{a ramp at the rear of the stadium gives vehicle access to the interior. the bottom of this ramp is now a maelstrom of activity. the regular washington redskins are in a picket line walking in circles. the players are dressed in everything from fur coats to expensive leather jackets and leather pants. half of them are on cell phones. we can see some of their cars parked haphazardly nearby: bmws, porsches, mercedes, etc. jerome lindell, the president of the players' association, is being interviewed on camera by a reporter.}

<D>__{as president of the players' association, what does your presence mean here, mister lindell?}
<C>__{lindell}
<D>__{very simply, support for these fine players and union men. washington d.c. is the home of freedom and the collective bargaining agreement. i am here to remind all americans that the owners are no better than the robber barons of the nineteenth century. they have blatantly gone out and hired scabs, which is against all principles of our constitution and the declaration of independence and probably even the emancipation proclamation.}
