<A>__{roderick takes from his portfolio a little jacket of very fine transparent skin, eight inches long and closed at one end, and which by way of a pouch string at its open end, has a narrow pink ribbon. he displays it to her, she looks at it, and laughs.}

<A>__{she puts it on, out of shot.}
<C>__{langeac}
<D>__{there you are, dressed by my hand. it is nearly the same thing; but despite the fineness and transparency of the skin, the little fellow pleases me less well in costume. it seems that this covering degrades him, or degrades me one of the other.}
