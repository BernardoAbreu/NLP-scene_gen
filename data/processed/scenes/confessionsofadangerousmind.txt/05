<L>__{interior taxi cab night}
<A>__{the back of the cab is filled with even more bags and boxes. the cab stops. the young man gets out and confers with a shady looking guy on the corner. the young man pulls out a big wad of cash. money and a small package change hands. the meter in the cab is at thirty five dollars and change.}
<B>__{the gong show}
<A>__{chuck barris is being sniffed in the crotch by a large dog. the audience howls with glee. suddenly the video image explodes. slow motion sparks and shards of glass shoot toward the camera. we pull back to reveal we're in a darkened, messy hotel room. we pan across the walls, past taped up, yellowed newspaper clippings with headlines like "gong show a new low in television", "the dumbing of america", and "chuck barris is the decline of western civilization." we come to rest on a naked middle aged man crouching in the shadows in the corner, holding a gun. this is chuck barris. the television continues to sputter, spark, and smoke. there is a knock at the door.}
<C>__{barris}
<P>__{(mumbly)}
<D>__{fuck. shit. piss.}
<A>__{naked barris, still holding the gun, seems panicked. he hesitates, trying to determine his options. should he answer the door? should he climb out onto the window ledge? finally, he creeps to the door and peeks out the peephole for a long moment. he unlocks the door, opens it. the sweaty, young man, a bellhop, stands there with his many bags. he tries to appear casual as takes in the sight: a naked chuck barris holding a gun, an exploded, smoking tv set in the background.}
<C>__{barris }
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{more stuff?}
<C>__{bellhop}
<D>__{yes sir, mr. barris. everything you requested. except i couldn't find a...}
<P>__{(consults list)}
<D>__{... dh 10 directional fragmentation mine.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{well, it's late.}
<P>__{(mumbling and bowing)}
<D>__{but thank you. thank you for trying. you are a scholar and a...}
<A>__{barris trails off, gives a quick glance both ways down the hall, then motions for the bellhop to enter. the bellhop places the bags on a table, fishes in his pocket and pulls out some bills.}
<C>__{barris }
<D>__{keep it. it's okay. keep it. you are a scholar and a...}
<A>__{barris trails off.}
<C>__{bellhop}
<P>__{(eyes averted)}
<D>__{thank you, sir.}
<A>__{suddenly barris becomes agitated.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{why are you not looking at me like that? do i look ugly to you?}
<P>__{(runs to the mirror)}
<D>__{it's the not sleeping. i'm not sleeping, see. i have a lot on my...}
<A>__{barris trails off. there is a pause. the bellhop attempts to make conversation.}
<C>__{bellhop}
<P>__{(re: exploded tv)}
<D>__{um, another gong show rerun, sir?}
<A>__{the naked barris approaches the bellhop, drapes his arm over the young man's shoulder and walks with him.}
<C>__{barris}
<P>__{(conspiratorially)}
<D>__{you know what i'd do? and don't tell anybody i'd rub... i'd rub alpo brand dog food on my dick so the dogs would stick their noses into my... dick. guaranteed big laugh, right? that was my trick, my great contribution to the world. how wouldn't i degrade myself, i ask you.}
<A>__{there is a silence.}
<C>__{barris }
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{i ask you!}
<C>__{bellhop}
<D>__{i... i... i don't know, sir.}
<A>__{suddenly barris punches himself in the head, flops down on the unmade bed. the bellhop glances at barris's bare ass, looks away.}
<C>__{bellhop }
<D>__{mr. barris, maybe if you just don't watch the show every night, you wouldn't have to }
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{i always pay for the damn tv's, don't i?}
<P>__{(turning to face him)}
<D>__{don't i?!}
<C>__{bellhop}
<D>__{it's yes, you do, sir, and we appreciate that it's just that there've been complaints from some of the other guests, and mr. andrews, the assistant manager, requested that i }
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{still? complaints? i specifically used the silencer this time! specifically!}
<C>__{bellhop}
<D>__{well, the people in 917 found a bullet lodged in their wall. and while we want to accommodate you we certainly value your patronage there is an issue of customer safety.}
<A>__{barris lets this sink in.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{yes, of course.}
<A>__{barris finds his pants draped over a chair, pulls out his wallet, holds some more money out to the bellhop.}
<C>__{barris }
<D>__{my apologies. buy 917, is it? buy them a magnum of your finest champagne. and... and your finest spackle. oh, and get me a bag of plastic army men while you're out. i forgot to tell you before.}
<A>__{the bellhop sighs, takes the money.}
<C>__{bellhop}
<D>__{thank you for your understanding, sir.}
<A>__{the bellhop exists.}
<C>__{barris}
<P>__{(calling after)}
<D>__{and some black socks! seven black socks, you rascule!}
<A>__{barris locks the door, dumps the contents of the bags onto the floor, fishes through the mess for a cigar, puts the cigar in his mouth, studies himself in a full length mirror.}
<C>__{barris }
<D>__{bellhop johnson was clearly repulsed by the sight of me. and why not? i'm wrinkled...}
<P>__{(searches for simile, then proudly)}
<D>__{... like a prune. covered in liver spots...}
<P>__{(searches for simile)}
<D>__{... like an old guy. my hair is falling out in clumps, leaving exposed patches of white, sickly scalp. a flabby inner tube of fat hangs from my waist, practically obscuring my bedraggled prick dark and shriveled and dead. still leaking urine even though i left the toilet ages ago. my asshole itches. hemorrhoids abound. george orwell said every man has the face he deserves by fifty. does every man have the asshole he deserves by fifty, as well? does every fifty year old asshole have the asshole he deserves?}
