<ACTION>__{JOHN LETOUR, forty, light sleeper. Never meant to be a drug dealer, it just came along. He's been other things: messenger boy, cab driver, model, postal clerk, doorman, nightclub shill -- never meant to be them either. Now he's a D.D. Drug dealer. JOHN LETOUR, well-groomed, khaki slacks, leather jacket, tippet-like scarf, belt pouch, "Beatle" boots, a shadow drifting in and out of other shadows, New York, day, night: watching, listening, rarely speaking -- nonexistent, seen only by those he sees. His face an affable blank. Make of it what you will. The eyes flicker; the hands shift discreetly. A map of calculation. Once he had a drug problem. Life turned a page. Today he follows instructions: he sleeps light -- one eye open, anticipating. JOHN LETOUR, D.D., loner, voyeur, has been drifting toward an unknown destination. At mid-life the destination draws near. The circle tightens. The dealer is anxious. The destination is love.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{NIGHT IN THE LIFE}
<ACTION>__{CREDIT SEQUENCE: New York by night. JOHN LETOUR nestles in back of a blue car service sedan, face reflected in the window. Neon mixes with steam, street people with tourists, young dates: each with a different agenda, a hidden purpose. His beeper goes off. He clicks it, checks the digital message. The DRIVER stops at an uptown corner. LETOUR opens the curbside door, motions to the DRIVER he'll be back in "ten" minutes. He enters the video laundromat, a twenty-four-hour video rental/laundromat/tanning salon. Inside, he meets a RETRO-YUPPIE (J. Crew Division) in the "Classics" section. They exit. On the sidewalk, money is exchanged for a packet. LETOUR pockets the uncounted cash. The YUPPIE mouths goodbye, eager to put distance between him and LETOUR. JOHN checks his beeper, stops at a pay phone, dials. JOHN LETOUR re-enters the sedan; the DRIVER heads downtown. High-rises give way to Tudor City. Uncollected trash lines the curbs. LETOUR eyes a PEDESTRIAN; PEDESTRIAN looks back. Later. Three a.m. The streets are dark. LeTour's car passes a glowing Korean market. LETOUR narrates from diary:}

<DIAL>__{Labor Day weekend. Some time for a sanitation strike. Everybody crazy to stock up. They decide to score at the last minute and want it now. Never fails. The faces look alike. You gotta use memory tricks: each has some peculiarity -- it keeps you sharp. A D.D. told me when a drug dealer starts writing a diary it's time to quit. I started writing after that. Not every night -- now and then. Just to burn off the night. Fill up one book, throw it out, start another.}

<ACTION>__{Four a.m.: streets empty. LeTour's sedan drops him off near a ten-story West 80s apartment building. JOHN gives the DRIVER a forty-dollar tip (standard procedure), turns the corner. He presses the intercom; a buzzer unlocks the door. He enters the lobby, walks past English reproduction furniture toward the elevators. Presses the button. Penthouse C door opens. ANN lets JOHN in with a smile. ANN, forty-four, striking in a tailored dress, greets him with a wet kiss. Her hair is coiffured, her face made up. She is John's employer, mentor, confidante, Mother Hen: she keeps the books. Her ingenuous demeanor belies sterner stuff: she's been in the drug business fifteen years. Ann's apartment is a jumble of sensibilities: dark green walls, zebra-skin sofa, Haitian wall friezes, framed magazine photos of Paramahansa Yogananda, Liz Taylor, the Duke of Windsor -- paintings stacked behind an oversized urn. A bird flits in its cage. One corner of the living area is devoted to a fledgling cosmetics business: Macintosh computer, billboard of trade paper clippings and ads, herbal samples, reference books, color charts. ROBERT, fifty, slight, waves hello as JOHN locks the door. Gay, hip, worn, he's John's "co-runner." They work -- and eat -- out of Ann's apartment. Take-out tins of Indian food are stacked amid crystals, tarot cards, glasses, and vitamin bottles. No sign of drugs, drug paraphernalia, or money.}

<ACTION>__{JOHN'S APARTMENT First light reflects across the Hudson as LETOUR walks west on 22nd Street toward his Chelsea apartment building. A delivery truck passes uncollected garbage. He enters a nondescript doorway. Inside his studio apartment, JOHN sits at a second-hand table writing in a composition book. He drinks from an eight-ounce glass of white wine, continues. The room has little personality; Ann's apartment has enough for two. Nails indicate where pictures once hung; a boombox sits on the linoleum floor amid cassettes, books (Autobiography of a Yogi, The Secret Doctrine), fashion magazines, a stack of unopened CDs. A futon is unrolled beneath the room's sole decoration, a poster of a human foot advertising a forgotten photo exhibit. Wine bottles -- Chenin Blanc. Precious little to show for forty years.
