<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{talk to me.}
<C>__{razor}
<D>__{not good, boss, i gotta compile a new descrambler. morpheus nods.}
<C>__{morpheus}

<C>__{morpheus}
<A>__{"we have to download our mission specs. move aside, i have to log into}
<D>__{the mainframe."}
<A>__{morpheus takes over razors seat. the scrolling code disappears, replaced by the small words: zion.dtr1.mnfr4m3 logon. morpheus pushes the keyboard under the console so its hidden from view. he taps at the keyboard. hidden password appears on the screen in the form of: xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx. screen: logon accepted. welcome, morpheus.}
<B>__{mission specs downloading... downloaded logout complete}
<A>__{mission type: infiltration destruction target: matrix mainframe morpheus eyes open slightly when he reads the screen, but he regains his composure quickly. razors mouth drops open, and choi starts cracking up.}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{the mainframe? haha. its a joke, right morpheus? is today april 1st ? niobe appears behind them.}
<C>__{niobe}
<D>__{its not a joke. we have the one. we must do it now.}
<C>__{razor}
<D>__{but theyre altering the code already. i cant even read it yet. morpheus turns and faces them.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<A>__{"we have our mission, but its up to us to interperate how well do}
<D>__{it."}
<C>__{razor}
<A>__{"morpheus, theres more ice in front of that mainframe than there is}
<D>__{in antarctica. well never cut through it all."}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{you havent seen the one in action. razor looks dubious, and turns to the screens.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{can you hack in?}
<A>__{razor pounds the keys. the matrix disappears, replaced by his program.}
<C>__{razor}
<A>__{"getting you in is no problem. maintaining the input output and helping you is the problem. thats how they killed savior number four, if i remember right. they cut the signal and trapped him in there." morpheus spins the chair, then stops it. their faces are inches apart.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{we dont speak of the past.}
<C>__{razor}
<D>__{excuse me for dragging up painful memories, sir.}
<A>__{he turns the chair back to the screen and continues coding.}
