<A>__{beloved is dancing beneath a bright moon. denver is an attentive, grateful audience.}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{where'd you learn to dance?}
<C>__{beloved}
<D>__{nowhere. look at me do this!}
<A>__{she puts her fists on her hips and skips.}
<C>__{beloved}
<D>__{now you! come on! come on!}
<A>__{she takes denver's hand and places another on her shoulder. as they dance, denver laughs harder and harder a giddiness from the dizziness and the gratitude she feels for beloved's attention. they spin and fall to the ground, like two lovers nestled. beloved catches her breath as denver asks;}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{why you call yourself beloved?}
<C>__{beloved}
<D>__{in the dark my name is beloved.}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{what's it like where you were before?}
<C>__{beloved}
<P>__{(a thoughtful expression)}
<D>__{dark. i'm small in that place. i'm like this here.}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{were you cold?}
<C>__{beloved}
<D>__{hot. nothing to breathe there. no room to move.}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{how did you get here?}
<C>__{beloved}
<D>__{i wait; then i got on the bridge. i stay there in the dark, in the daytime, in the dark in the daytime. long time.}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{all this time you were on the bridge?}
<C>__{beloved}
<D>__{no. after. when i got out.}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{why'd you come here?}
<C>__{beloved}
<D>__{to see her face.}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{ma'am's? sethe's?}
<C>__{beloved}
<D>__{yes. sethe.}
<A>__{and with that, denver takes a breath of courage to ask the question she's been longing to ask:}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{you my sister, ain't you? you really are.}
<A>__{beloved looks at her and smiles. they are so close she leans in curiously and touching denver's face kisses her on the lips.}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{you won't leave us, will you?}
<C>__{beloved}
<D>__{no. never. this is where i am.}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{i knew it. i knew. first time i saw you and you said your name. and when you touched me real gentle. and familiar. like i'd felt that touch before.}
<A>__{smiling, beloved moves to touch denver's cheek when suddenly, denver sits up cross legged and urges beloved;}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{don't tell mama. you musn't tell her who you really are. i don't know what she'd do! please, you hear?}
<A>__{suddenly, beloved's face turns to rage as she rises up as well;}
<C>__{beloved}
<D>__{don't tell me what to do? don't never tell me what to do!?}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{but..but i'm on your side. i want to protect you...}
<C>__{beloved}
<P>__{(stands above denver)}
<D>__{she's the one! she's the one i need! you can go but she's the one i have to have!}
<A>__{beloved abruptly drops to her knees and crawls out the boxwood bush room as denver's pleads;}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{no. beloved please! don't go! i didn't do nothing! we were dancing! don't go!....}
