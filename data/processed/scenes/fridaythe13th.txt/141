<L>__{interior boy's cabin night}
<A>__{the door bursts open, a flashlight pierces the shadows, and jack and marcie rush in and plop on the bottom bunk of the nearest bed.}
<C>__{marcie}
<D>__{are you wet?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{just a little. wait a minute, woman.}
<A>__{he reaches down and put his flashlight on its end so it points straight up and gives them some light to see by. they go into a long passionate kiss which is broken by marcie's hand coming up from behind jack and tugging his t shirt up towards his head. he leans back and takes it off, and tosses it at the camera.}
