<L>__{interior a smaller apartment, kitchen a night remembered}
<A>__{a younger annie stands in a bathrobe, noticeably pregnant, cooking at a stove reading instructions from a propped up cookbook. frank sinatra is blasting as she sings along, in full voice, without inhibitions;}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{"she's loves the theatre but never comes late... she never bothers with people she hates... that's why the lady is a tramp!..."}
<A>__{a younger robert, wearing a suit, arrives home from work. seeing her, he smiles affectionately. he puts down his briefcase and bursts into his own playful sinatra impersonation:}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{"she loves the free..."}
<A>__{startled, annie turns around and smiles:}
<C>__{robert}
<P>__{(sexily undoing his tie)}
<D>__{"... fresh, wind in her hair... life without care... she's broke... but it's 'ok'...}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(a la fan)}
<D>__{sing it to me, frankie!}
<C>__{robert}
<P>__{(a la sinatra cool)}
<D>__{how's my pregnant chick!}
<A>__{she moves to him and they embrace... he wraps his arms around her. they kiss. annie laughs.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{you can hardly get your arms around me. how depressing. you're so early.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{i had to excuse myself from a meeting. it's ridiculous. i kept thinking about the baby... you... and, i swear, i was going to start bawling right into my briefs.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(loving it)}
<D>__{aw... that's so sweet.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{i love you.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{do you? do you really?}
<A>__{they turn to each other and kiss.}
