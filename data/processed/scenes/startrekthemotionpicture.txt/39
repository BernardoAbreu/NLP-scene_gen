<A>__{a confusion of activity and voices. pieces o equip ment in a state of disarray: consoles open, fiber optic tubes unconnected, viewing screens dismantled. it's a frantic, desperate scene a ship and crew to tally unprepared. in the midst of this: alien ensign is assisting uhura (lt. comdr. stripes)deftly working her communications station, ad libbing "... hailing frequency four, check. hailing frequency five, will someone please check me?" at the helm, sweat soaked sulu (lt. comdr stripes) has a service plate open, is peering inside to make delicate adjust ments, ad libbing "... helm, now give me a reading on four point zero zero six of full." and at the weapons control, chekov (full lt.)argues with technicians who insist photon torpedoes read "ready" while chekov argues the computer is not relaying that information.}

<A>__{snapping open and there is kirk. for the moment no one notices him, and he stands watching, remembering. and then he moves forward toward the command center.}
<B>__{across uhura to kirk}
<A>__{as she is the first to see him. she reacts,pleased.}
<C>__{uhura}
<D>__{captain... starfleet just signaled your transfer of command orders!}
<A>__{another angle various reaction as everyone else is suddenly aware of kirk. all work stops, with various ad libbed greetings from the old crew: "admiral kirk..." "it's the captain...!" etc., etc. but most sit or stand, simple gaping at kirk, all quite awed. the old hands, uhura, sulu, and chekov start converging on kirk. but he gestures them back, speaking crisply.}
