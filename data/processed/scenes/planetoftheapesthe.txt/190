<A>__{the temple itself is small and austere. there is no altar, but against a plain backdrop we see a statue of the lawgiver, a great ape holding a book. below the lawgiver is an orangutan minister clothed in black robes. he stands in front of a closed coffin. a dozen mourners, seated on comfortable wicker chairs, form a semi circle around the coffin. the ape ladies wear cowls.}

<D>__{weep if you must, but make an end of sorrow. he lives again. yes, he has found peace in heaven.}
