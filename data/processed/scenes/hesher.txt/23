<A>__{tj sits in the back of the class, by the window. a little pebble hits tj's desk. it bounces onto the floor. tj looks around to find where it came from and then another one hits him in the head. he looks out the window. hesher is right outside the window. he takes the cap off of a large black magic marker. he holds it up to his nose and takes a long slow inhale. he exhales slow and long, staring hard at tj. tj looks around confused. hesher recaps the marker, throws it hard at tj and wanders off. the marker hits tj, then falls to floor near his feet. he reaches for it. mrs. elsberry sees this.}
