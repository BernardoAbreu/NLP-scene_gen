<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{to tell you the truth, mr raleigh, there are times when i'm tired of being always in control.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{nonsense.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{you don't mean a word of it. you eat and drink control.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{do you say so?}
<A>__{the exercise ends. all clap.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{bess, you must try a dance with mr raleigh. he's eager to show us his skill.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{no skill at all, majesty. i don't know the steps.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{oh, it's very simple.}
<A>__{he goes to bess to demonstrate, holding her by the waist.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{you stand like this, with your hands firmly clasped here and when she jumps, on the eighth step, you swing her round once, twice, three times and you're back to the beginning. what could be simpler?}
<C>__{dancing master}
<D>__{your majesty knows the dance better than i.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{so come, mr raleigh. take your position. i am to be obeyed.}
<C>__{raleigh}

<P>__{(to the musicians)}
<D>__{play!}
<A>__{the dance begins again. bess jumps, and raleigh swings her round and round, finding the knack after an awkward start. elizabeth watches, smiling, nodding to the beat. she can see the faces of the dancers; and so long as she controls the intimacy between them, she's excited by it. walsingham enters and stands by her side, watching.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<P>__{(low)}
<D>__{leave her alone, walsingham. i want both of them left alone.}
