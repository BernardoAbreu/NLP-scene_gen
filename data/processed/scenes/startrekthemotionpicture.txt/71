<L>__{interior kirk's cabin kirk and mccoy}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{get out of here, bones. mccoy}
<P>__{(shakes head)}
<D>__{as ship's doctor, i am now discussing the subject of command fitness.}
<A>__{kirk's expression hardens.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{make your point, doctor. mccoy the point, captain, is that it's you who's competing...}
<P>__{(a beat, as kirk reacts)}
<D>__{you pulled every string in the book short of blackmail to get the enterprise maybe even that. and when this mission is over, you have no intention of giving her back.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(tight)}
<D>__{i intend to keep her, is that what you're saying, doctor? mccoy it's an obsession that can blind you so far more immediate and critical responsibilities. your reaction to decker is an example.}
<A>__{kirk studies him a beat; has mccoy touched a nerve? something kirk himself might have been unaware of? kirk starts speaking, but is interrupted by:}
<C>__{uhura's intercom voice}
<D>__{bridge to captain.}
<B>__{angle to include cabin viewer}
<A>__{as kirk turns to it.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{viewer on.}
<A>__{at his voice command, the viewer comes on with an image of uhura at her console.}
<C>__{uhura from viewer}
<D>__{signal from a federation registered long range shuttle, sir. she wishes to come alongside, and lock on.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{for what purpose?}
<A>__{on the viewer, chekov's image replaces uhura.}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{it is a courier, captain. grade one priority. non belligerency confirmed.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{very well, mr. chekov, see to it. viewer off.}
<A>__{viewer image fades. kirk turns back to mccoy whose question of kirk's fitness still hangs there between them. eye to eye then, finally:}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{your... opinion has been noted, doctor.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{is there anything further? mccoy i hope not.}
<A>__{kirk nods, exits. mccoy watches him go, hoping his point has gotten through.}
