<L>__{exterior lake george water & swirling smoke day}
<A>__{the bottom of the frame is water like glass. smoke obscures the background. fingers tendril towards us. out of the mist we hear small splashing and then the high bow of a war canoe defines itself. it's paddled towards us. hawkeye, chingachgook & uncas cora's behind hawkeye. alice and the wounded ranger are near uncas. closer: hawkeye & cora cora looks left. her eyes go wide.}

<C>__{hawkeye}
<D>__{you got nothin' better to do today on lake george than shoot me, major, then go ahead ...}
<A>__{heyward's a hair's breadth from firing. suddenly they hear the boom of muskets and rounds come in.}
<B>__{wide}
<A>__{they're being pursued by three boatloads and then a fourth and fifth of huron.}
<B>__{heyward}
<A>__{is indifferent to huron musket balls. hawkeye hasn't stopped paddling and pays heyward no heed.}
<C>__{cora}
<D>__{stop it!!}
<A>__{heyward comes to his senses. his head is gashed. a scarf, as a tourniquet, is tied around his leg. he lowers the gun.}
<C>__{heyward}
<D>__{when you fall into british hands again, nathaniel poe, i will have you hanged.}
<B>__{huron canoes}
<A>__{paddle hard and deep and the canoes power across the lake. hawkeye & heyward's canoes with less paddlers, plus wounded, are slower and will be overtaken.}
<B>__{hawkeye}
<A>__{looks to uncas. they both realize the same thing. hawkeye nods and he, uncas & chingachgook begin to paddle furiously. the others match the doubled pace. they're sprinting ahead but the effort is exhausting.}
<B>__{huron canoes}
<A>__{maintain their steady pace. three or four hurons fire. hawkeye's canoe musket balls ricochet on the water's surface. one rips a hole through the bow. hawkeye sees one of the redcoats in heyward's canoe is giving out ...}

<D>__{only chance we got is ...}
<P>__{(breathless)}
<D>__{... to get more distance on 'em and go to ground!}
<A>__{heyward digs in. like firecrackers in the distance, huron muskets sound. a new hail of musket balls cut the fabric of the canoes. one redcoat is shot in the back. he falls overboard.}

<D>__{pull!!}
<B>__{hawkeye canoe}

<D>__{what white water?}
<A>__{heyward & redcoat's pov: lake divided by a spit of land. the right fork becomes a river with white water rapids. hawkeye canoe hawkeye paddling now, too, as they furiously jam for the white water that will shoot them way ahead of the hurons.}
<B>__{uncas}
<A>__{leaps off the stern of hawkeye's canoe and climbs up the stern of heyward's and takes control. he roughly gestures to the redcoat and the major to stop paddling. he and hawkeye will pilot the two canoes.}
