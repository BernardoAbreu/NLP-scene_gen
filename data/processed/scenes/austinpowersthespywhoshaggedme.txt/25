<A>__{montage (time lapse): technicians in white suits and masks transform the room into a love lair: a pair of latex gloved hands carefully puts a burt bacharach record on a turntable. examination lights are replaced with lava lamps. a tray is brought in with a videotape marked "swedish educational film." finally, the transformation is complete. austin lies in bed reading a vintage playboy. a candy stripe nurse enters, very pretty, in a tight outfit.}
