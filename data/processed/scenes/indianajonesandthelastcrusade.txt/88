<A>__{the remaining nazi soldier maneuvers his motorcycle around his fallen comrades and continues the chase.}
<B>__{indy and henry}
<A>__{as the remaining nazi soldier rides alongside their motorbike he cocks his gun, preparing to fire. indy quickly jams the remaining portion of the flagpole through the spokes of the nazi's front wheel. the nazi soldier's motorcycle flips three times, throwing him high into the air. indy glances back and smiles, but the smile fades as he looks forward again to see a sign at a crossroad. arrows pointing in opposite directions indicate the way to berlin or venedig. indy starts down the road marked venedig.}

<D>__{stop!}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{stop! stop!}

<C>__{henry}
<D>__{my diary's in berlin.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{you don't need the diary, dad. marcus has the map.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{there is more in the diary than just the map.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{all right dadtell me.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{well, he who finds the grail must face the final challenge.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{what final challenge?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{three devices of such lethal cunning.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{booby traps?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{oh, yes. but i found the clues that will safely take us through, in the chronicles of st. anselm.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{but what are they? can't you remember?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i wrote them down in my diary so that i wouldn't have to remember}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{half the german army's on our tail and you want me to go to berlin? into the lion's den?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{yes! the only thing that matters is the grail.}

<D>__{marcus would agree with me.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{two selfless martyrs. jesus christl}
<A>__{henry slaps him across the face. indy is rocked to his foundations, not by any means entirely by the blow itself.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{that's for blasphemy. the quest for the grail is not archaeology. it's a race against evil. if it is captured by the nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. do you understand me?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{this is an obsession dad. i never understood it. never. neither did mom.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{oh yes, she did. only too well. unfortunately she kept her illness from me until all i could do was mourn her.}
