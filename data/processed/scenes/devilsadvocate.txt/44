<A>__{with that, milton pushes a button. huge panel screens open out to:}
<L>__{exterior milton's terrace day}
<A>__{a reflecting pool. water right to the edge. a narrow walkway straight through the middle. and we're fifty stories above the city. the effect is staggering.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{what do you think? some people can't handle it.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{it's peaceful.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{exactly.}
<P>__{(pleased)}
<D>__{fill in the resume. tell me about your family. what does your father do?}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{i never got to know my father. he passed away before i was born. my mom raised me. just the two of us.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{she never remarried?}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{she wasn't married the first time.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{that can't be easy in gainesville.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{i don't think it's easy anywhere.}
<P>__{(re the view)}
<D>__{holy shit...}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{little different when you're looking down, isn't it?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{tell me about her. your mother. what's she like?}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{she's a preacher's daughter. she's tough. she's worked in the same poultry plant for as long as i can remember. i think she's up to eight fifty an hour. she's got a church she really likes, so she's usually either there or they go out, they do a lot of volunteer work.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{'many are in high places, and of great renown: but mysteries are revealed unto the meek.'}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{so they say.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{didn't rub off on you? the book? the church?}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{i'm on parole. early release for time served.}
<A>__{suddenly they're quiet. silenced by the view.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{lotta potential clients down there. (sooner or later it all}
<P>__{flows through the streets.)}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{you don't have to sell me on new york.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{you like it here, don't you?}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{are we negotiating?}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{always.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{why do you need a criminal department?}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{because our clients break the law just like everyone else and i'm tired of sending their business across the street.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{are you offering me a job?}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{i'm thinking about it. you have the talent. i knew that before you got here. it's the other thing i wonder about.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{what thing is that?}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{pressure. changes everything. some people, you squeeze them, they focus. some people fold. can you summon your talent at will? can you deliver on deadline? can you sleep at night?}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{when do we talk about money?}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{money's the easy part.}
