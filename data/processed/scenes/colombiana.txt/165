<A>__{marco and his thugs enter a small social club bar.}
<L>__{interior social club day}
<A>__{a dimly lit place, where strangers are few and suspicious looks from the rough men playing pool at the back to able and lining the bar are par for the course. eduardo, a small time hood, lines up a shot with a pool cue, when a hand comes down on the ball he is about to shoot. he looks up to...}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{hello eduardo, que pasa?}
<C>__{eduardo}
<D>__{i have fifty bucks on this shot. that's what's que pasa.}
<C>__{marco}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{hey sorry. come on.}
<A>__{he opens his arms. they hug. eduardo is friendly, but there is a hesitation, a tension in the air. as they break marco takes a roll of cash out.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{here. for you.}
<A>__{he goes to hand it to eduardo.}
<C>__{eduardo}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{first for fucking up your shot. second, for an address. you remember fabio? the cataleya killer?}
<C>__{eduardo}
<D>__{it's a long time. my memory...}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{you went to school with his brother in law. what was his name? emilio?}
<C>__{eduardo}
<D>__{like i said...my memory...}
<A>__{now the men at the bar are starting to take notice.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{i have a problem. and we think fabio's kid is behind it.}
<A>__{eduardo takes the roll of bills and puts it in marco's shirt pocket.}
<C>__{eduardo}
<D>__{look marco. i gotta be honest with you. everyone knows you guys were playing a double game, and when the shit went down, you were the only ones who got out of it clean.}
<A>__{the men at the bar are now edging closer. one of them has a shot gun resting along his leg, inconspicuous, and conspicuous at the same time.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{so you do have a memory.}
<C>__{eduardo}
<D>__{yeah. for rats. now get the fuck out, and let me take my shot.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{ok...}
<A>__{marco looks at eduardo, who glares at him. eduardo goes to line up his shot. the tension in the room is thicker by the moment. as eduardo is about to hit the ball, marco grabs his hair and slams his forehead into the cue ball. at the same moment, marco's two thugs whip out their guns and blast away. the shotgun wielding man, raises his gun, and as he is killed by marco, his blast takes out one of marco's thugs. in an instant it is over. everyone is dead, except marco, one of his thugs, and the dazed eduardo. marco notices his ear is bleeding, touches it, it pisses him off that blood has soiled his white shirt.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{fuck...}
<A>__{pissed, marco yanks eduardo up from the floor and slams him onto the pool table. sticks his gun in his face.}
<C>__{marco}
<D>__{you don't tell me what i want to know by the count of three, you scum sucking lowlife prick, your memory will be permanently disabled. one...two...}
<A>__{a buzzer sounds...}
