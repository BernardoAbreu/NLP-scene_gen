<A>__{the ships flip, roll, and turn at incredible speed, didging, weaving and firing. they tumble from near misses. hits fly off obi wan's fighter as one of jango's missiles gets through. finally, it seems as if obi wan is getting the upper hand. jango fett breaks off the fight and dives sharply. he maneuvers deftly between two huge asteroids. in jango fett's cockpit, boba fett flinches as asteroids pass very close by.}

<D>__{stay calm, son. we'll be fine. that jedi won't be able to follow us through this.}
<A>__{but obi wan ship dives into the asteroid belt after them. in obi wan's cockpit, his skill is pushed to the limit as he throws the ship from side to side, avoiding great rocks. then a huge asteroid tumbles across his path. there seem no way he can avoid it. obi wan fires a couple of aerial torpedoes. they streak toward the asteroid. in jango's cockpit, they see the huge explosion as obi wan's ship appears to smash into the asteroid.}
