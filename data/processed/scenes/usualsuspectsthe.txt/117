<A>__{keaton is weaving through tight, low ceiling corridors, looking in every cabin, working his way towards the bottom of the boat. elsewhere in the boat, mcmanus is tearing though the corridors, seemingly less interested in securing the cargo as he is in killing everyone on board. he screams like a lunatic, shooting everything in his path, killing some men with his bare hands, shooting others, stabbing others still with a knife he has brought along.}
