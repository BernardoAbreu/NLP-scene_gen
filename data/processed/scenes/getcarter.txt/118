<L>__{exterior swing bridge evening}
<A>__{the huge steel superstructure pivots on a large man made island in the middle of the river. on top is a structure not unlike a small lighthouse, from which a man operates the bridge. carter climbs the outside ladder. a man waits for him at the top. the man hands him a small cloth package. carter opens it. inside is heroin and a hypodermic. he wraps it up again and hands over an envelope. the man checks the money as carter disappears down the outside ladder.}
