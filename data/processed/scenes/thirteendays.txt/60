<A>__{ day super: wednesday, october 17th. day 2 a long shot of an enormous crowd thronging a bunting trimmed platform. the president, barely recognizable at the distance, and a cluster of political vips wave from it, smiling. kenny steps into frame, back here at the fringes of the crowd.}
<C>__{the president }
<D>__{doesn't anybody in connecticut have to work today?}
<A>__{the crowd goes nuts. kenny paces, checks his watch, impatient to be done with the necessary diversion. kenny gazes off to his right and spots scotty reston, along with half the white house press corps suckered along. scotty catches kenny's look. kenny turns away, but scotty comes weaving over. the president continues on, but all we hear is scotty and kenny.}

<D>__{why don't you ask him yourself? you can have him on the way home.}
<C>__{reston}
<D>__{i'm giving you a chance here: talk to me. you can influence how this thing unfolds.}
<A>__{but kenny stands there, mute. reston just shakes his head, knowing for sure something's up. he turns and heads back for the press corps.}
<D>__{exterior stairs to air force one day}
<A>__{kenny and the president climb the stairs to the presidential plane, the crowd cheering him. he gives a final wave.}
