<L>__{interior zoe's apartment day}
<A>__{zoe lies in bed with nuts. she opens her eyes and stares at the ceiling. then, with a sigh, she gets up and does her morning ritual. she pulls up her nightgown and sticks out her stomach. for the first time, we actually see a little bump.}
<L>__{interior exam room day}
<A>__{zoe lies on the table with a paper gown over her lap. she looks down at her feet in the stirrups. sadly, we notice a perfect pedicure. dr. harris comes in with a big smile.}
<C>__{dr. harris}
<D>__{congratulations! what luck to get pregnant on the first try, huh? and with frozen sperm, too. so, how are we feeling?}
<C>__{zoe}
<P>__{(unconvincing)}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{dr. harris}
<D>__{you sure about that?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{it's been hard. i don't know if i was really prepared for this.}
<C>__{dr. harris}
<D>__{well, your hormones aren't helping, and going through this without a partner must be difficult.}
<A>__{dr. harries readies the ultrasound wand and inserts the device. he turns the monitor so that zoe can see.}
<C>__{dr. harris }
<D>__{well, the good news is everything looks great. you are now eight weeks pregnant, which is an important milestone. with a little luck, we should be able to see a heartbeat today.}
<A>__{on the screen we see a small flickering dot. dr. harris smiles.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{that's it? that's...my baby?}
<A>__{saying these words out loud for the first time hits zoe. tears fill her eyes.}
<C>__{zoe }
<D>__{hi, baby.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{is it okay? is it healthy?}
<C>__{dr. harris}
<D>__{everything's just...}
<P>__{(makes a face, then)}
<D>__{wait, a minute...}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{what? wait a minute, what?}
<C>__{dr. harris}
<D>__{well...i see another heartbeat.}
<C>__{zoe}
<P>__{(freaking out)}
<D>__{it has two hearts?}
<C>__{dr. harris}
<D>__{no...but you have two babies.}
<A>__{zoe's mouth falls open. nt. carol's apartment day we're back at single women by choice. the women are sitting on the floor. sara is still nursing dakota. zoe has her head in her hands.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{twins! that's fantastic!}
<A>__{zoe bursts into tears.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{why are you crying? that's so lucky.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{yup. that's me. lucky, lucky, me.}
<A>__{the women are sensing the sarcasm, but not getting it.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{are you okay? is it a financial concern? there are many programs }
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{no. i'm fairly loaded, actually. used to work for google.}
<P>__{(blows nose)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. this is hard for me. i don't know if i can talk about it yet.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{take your time. when you feel like sharing, we're here for you. we're all sisters here.}
<P>__{(then, to the group)}
<D>__{let's give zoe some space. when she's ready to talk, we're ready to listen. deep, cleansing breaths, zoe.}
<A>__{carol takes a deep breath and then lets it out.}
<C>__{carol }
<D>__{now, in the meantime, does anyone else have anything they want to discuss? problems? concerns?}
<A>__{tabitha, the tall woman with the nose ring, raises her hand.}
<C>__{tabitha}
<D>__{i'm having a hard time. luca keeps asking why he doesn't have a daddy, and i just don't know what }
<C>__{zoe}
<P>__{(blurting out)}
<D>__{there's this guy. his name is stan. and he's fantastic.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{i knew it!}
<C>__{tabitha}
<D>__{uh...wasn't i just speaking?}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{i knew you were with that guy!}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{what guy?}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{zoe, this group is called single mother's by choice.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i know. i'm sorry }
<C>__{tabitha}
<D>__{um, excuse me. what about luca? he's been really, really sad.}
<C>__{zoe}
<P>__{(floodgates opening)}
<D>__{have you ever met a guy and you get butterflies and you think this is the kind of man who could take care of me forever? the kind of guy who makes you re examine everything? like, maybe i can be a stay at home mom and be barefoot and pregnant.}
<A>__{the women stare blankly at zoe.}
<C>__{zoe }
<D>__{he actually lives on a farm! plays the banjo! maybe i could learn to sew and take care of the animals. like laura ingalls.}
<A>__{even dakota stops nursing and looks over at that one.}
