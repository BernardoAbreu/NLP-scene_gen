<A>__{penelope sleeps, bruised and battered. bloom sits bedside uncomfortably, arm in a wimpy sling. she stirs. bloom leans forward. slurred with sleep and drugs, she painfully barely breathes}

<D>__{are you alright?}
<L>__{interior hospital hallway night}
<A>__{bloom consults with stephen and the chink, both in scrubs.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{the chink had it i'm telling him, i know, thank you in her report, i missed it. this is actually kind of great, i will tell you why.}
<A>__{the chink lights a cigarette.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{you missed it?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{dostoevsky was an epileptic.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{his seizures were preceded by an enlightened euphoria, a sort of opening of his spiritual eye.}
<C>__{stephen }
<D>__{i think the fact that she saw your face the instant before a seizure is a pretty goddamn good foot to start things out on, right?}
<A>__{bloom stares blankly. the chink burps into her stethoscope.}
