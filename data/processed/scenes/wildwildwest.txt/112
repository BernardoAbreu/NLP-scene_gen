<L>__{interior loveless's train engine day}
<A>__{loveless has only a moment to gloat over his marksmanship before the compartment begins filling with smoke. choking clouds that send loveless et al into coughing fits.}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{close the fire door!}
<A>__{just in time, amazonia swings it shut as the unvented boiler explodes, sending a fireball ripping through the back of the train, destroying it. up ahead...}
<L>__{interior wanderer parlor car day}
<A>__{gordon and rita are thrown across the car, along with everything else inside, as loveless's train's sudden stop... jerks them with it. the screech of steel wheels scraping on iron rails is sickening. they clutch onto one another... as the wanderer skids to a stop. as they pick themselves up, gordon looks to rita who's shaken up and scared. now footsteps coming up the stairs.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{i won't let loveless take me again! i'd rather be dead!}
<C>__{gordon}
<P>__{(recalling west's words)}
<D>__{that's not a good one to wish for.}
<A>__{to defend herself, rita grabs one of the sleeping gas pool balls rolling around on the ground. gordon leads her into the stateroom to lock her in, but she grabs his hand.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{please, artemus, don't leave me alone!}
<A>__{rita closes the door behind him and locks it.}
