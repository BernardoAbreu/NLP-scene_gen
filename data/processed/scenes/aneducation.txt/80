<L>__{interior club. night}
<A>__{the four walk in and take their coats over to the cloakroom. the club is a smoky west end club, full of smartly dressed and dubious looking men, and young, glamorous, dubious looking women. jenny and helen look out of place helen too ethereal, jenny too innocent. there is jazz playing.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{there he is.}
<A>__{we see a nasty looking man in his late 30s early 40s. he is wearing a white sharksin suit and smoking a big cigar. he's standing by the roulette table, talking to an even nastier looking man in a dark suit. they find a table at the back and sit down. a waitress comes over to their table.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{a bottle of champagne, please.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{oh ho. champagne, eh?}
<A>__{he looks at jenny and david expectantly.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{don't be bashful.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{no. be sneezy.}
<A>__{everyone ignores her.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{all right, then. if you won't tell them i will. jenny got two as and a b in her mock a levels.}

<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{the b was in latin. but it's much better than it was, isn't it, minnie?}
<A>__{rachman is now standing on his own. danny nudges david, and they go over to talk to him just as the champagne arrives. the waiter pops the bottle of champagne and pours two glasses. the girls smile and clink glasses.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{don't worry.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{someone told me that in fifty years no one will speak latin, probably. not even latin people. so you shouldn't mind too much about your b.}
<A>__{jenny stares at her, trying to think of a response.}
