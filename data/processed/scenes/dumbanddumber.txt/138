<L>__{exterior truckstop morning}
<A>__{the mutt cutts van is parked next to a couple rigs and harry is sitting beside it on the pavement, a broken man.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{i'm only human, harry. anybody can make a mistake.}
<A>__{but harry just sits there, practically catatonic.}
<C>__{lloyd }
<D>__{come on, man, pull yourself together.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you know, i got half a mind to just jump on the bus to europe and say goodbye to your ugly mug forever.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(rolls his eyes)}
<D>__{you can't take a bus to europe, dodo.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{oh yeah? why not?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{you don't have a passport.}
<A>__{harry lets out a defeated sigh.}
<C>__{lloyd }
<D>__{come on, stop being a baby about this. okay, so we back tracked a tad.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{a tad? lloyd, you drove almost a sixth of the way across the country in the wrong direction. now we don't have enough money to get to aspen, we on't have enough money to get home, we don't have enough to eat, we don't have enough to sleep!}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{well it doesn't do any good having you sitting there on your butt whining about it. if we're gonna get out of this hole, we're gonna have to dig ourselves out.}
<A>__{harry thinks about this.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you know, you're absolutely right, lloyd.}
<A>__{he stands up, brushes off his pants, and starts to walk toward the highway.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{where you going?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{home. i'm walking home.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{you can't be serious.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{why not? we're probably only five miles away.}
<A>__{harry starts resolutely toward the road while lloyd watches.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{thanks a lot, mr. perfect. like you never screwed up.}
<A>__{harry suddenly stops in his tracks and turns back to his friend. he seems completely rained.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{look, man... i'm sorry.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i never should have let you talk me into this in the first place. you've got a good reason to goo a beautiful girl's waiting for you. but let's face it, lloyd, there's nothing waiting for me in aspen.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{there's nothing waiting for me anywhere.}
<A>__{lloyd just stands there, speechless, as harry turns and walks away. out of frustration, he bangs the snout of the car, causing it to bark.}
