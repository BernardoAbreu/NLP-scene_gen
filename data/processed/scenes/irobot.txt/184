<L>__{interior hogenmiller's lab late night}
<A>__{hogenmiller's lab. sounds of humming and buzzing. active terminals casting ghostly illuminations over metal heads, gutted bodies. the door slides open. spooner, calvin and sonny re enter the crime scene. spooner. looks around.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{somehow the robot's the key to what happened during the few seconds hogenmiller walked in here and that shot was fired.}
<A>__{he reaches into his pocket. pulling out the metal s.o.n.n.y. nameplate. holds it up.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{and this is the key to the robot.}
<A>__{sonny. cocking his head. reading the nameplate.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{that's my name.}
<A>__{calvin takes the nameplate.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i think i have an idea where this goes.}
<A>__{they both. turn to sonny. and at the same time:}
<C>__{spooner and calvin}
<D>__{sit down.}
<A>__{calvin maneuvers a chair behind the robot. sonny plops down. shifting nervously.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{just hold still, okay?}
<A>__{calvin locates that slit. at the base of sonny's neck. slides the nameplate into it and snaps it into place. steps back. nothing. sonny. looking back and forth. between calvin. and spooner. a few more seconds. tick by. until suddenly... he lets out a terrifying mechanical scream. as his body. jolts back. legs, kicking. arms, flailing. as his chest. begins opening up. metal. peeling back... spooner and calvin watch in surprise as its interior unfolds like a puzzle box. a labyrinthine area that is the second battery. suddenly fanning out to reveal... a central brain made out of living tissue. spooner, stunned. calvin, rushing forward, excited...}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{oh, my god! this is organic tissue! when we talk about a positronic brain, it's a figure of speech. but this...this is a living brain...}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{jesus. it really is alive.}
<A>__{as we move in. tracing the pathways of the synthetic brain.}
<C>__{calvin }
<D>__{hogenmiller created a cell that could live outside a biological medium. the cells grow and organise themselves like any human brain. this is the first self organising neural net!}
<A>__{as the metal casings. begin returning to their original places. closing up. the clicking. of all the pieces...}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{self organising neural net...}
<P>__{(putting it together)}
<D>__{"sonny."}
<A>__{sonny. closed back up. shaking slightly from the experience.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{this is why dr. hogenmiller was murdered.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{this robot scared the hell out of someone.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{who? robertson?}
<A>__{spooner. walks into the center of the room. looking around.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{no. i don't think he knew what hogenmiller was doing in here. sonny was the obvious suspect. the only one i wanted to find. and the killer was counting on that. on my prejudice.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<C>__{spooner }
<D>__{but take the robot out of the picture. and what do you see?}
<A>__{as we pan the lab. there's nothing there. just a forest of inanimate limbs. nothing that could have fired that weapon. calvin sees nothing...and neither do we.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i see nothing.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{neither do i.}
<A>__{he crouches down low.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{it hit me today, when i was in the junkyard. a locked room. a single shot fired through the mouth. bruises on both wrists...and a suspect with only two arms. the answer has been staring us in the face all along.}
<A>__{calvin. even more confused.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{how can a killer appear out of thin air, then disappear without a trace?}
<A>__{he reaches out and unhooks a metal arm. hanging from the wall. holds it up.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{when it can put itself together and take itself apart.}
