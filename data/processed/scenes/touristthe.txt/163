<A>__{cara and frank step on board. the driver starts the engine. he turns to reveal... that he is the "englishman" we've seen throughout the movie. he and frank look at one another for a moment.}

<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(english accent)}
<D>__{it's good to see you too.}
<A>__{they embrace warmly. cara is in disbelief, realizing just how completely frank alexander has planned things out. she casts one last glance backwards.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{you really think they'll just give up?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{the americans have their money. i left it all for them.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{what about demidov's money?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{well...}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{you have to save something for your pension.}
<A>__{the englishman opens the door to the cabin for them. a bottle of crystal champagne and two glasses are set out for them. frank leads cara in and offers her a glass. instead, she slips into his arms and presses against him. they begin to kiss... camera stays discreetly behind as they pull away from us, the water taxi swinging out into the grand canal. as it recedes from view, the vaporetto's tail lamps shimmer and blend into the beautiful lights of venice... a city for lovers.}
