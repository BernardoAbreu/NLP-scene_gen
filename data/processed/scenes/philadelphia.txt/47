<A>__{joe sits at a table in the public law library, surrounded by books and legal pads, hard at work. he's eating a pastrami sandwich which he hides behind a reference book when a librarian saunters by (interior day) ... a chair squeaks and joe looks up to see: andrew taking a seat across the room ( the blotches have been reduced by chemo, but he's struggling with a cold ). andrew removes notepads and pens from his briefcase. he takes out a package of tissues, blowing his nose.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{shit...}
<A>__{joe slides to the far end of his table, stacking seven or eight huge reference books in front of him. joe's pov, peering through the reference books: andrew opens a book, taking notes. rubs his eyes. writes something. sneezes. a librarian delivers a book to andrew.}

<D>__{this is the supplement. you're right, there is a section on...}

<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{andrew takes the book from her but she remains.}
<C>__{librarian}
<D>__{we have a private research room available.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{i'm fine, thanks.}
<A>__{andrew blows his nose. now other patrons are watching.}

<C>__{andrew}
<P>__{(pleasantly)}
<D>__{no. but would it make you more comfortable?}
<C>__{librarian}
<D>__{whatever, sir.}
<A>__{the librarian turns away, shrugging to a patron, indicating she's done all she can do. as joe continues to watch: one of andrew's neighbors picks up his books and moves away. joe rises, gliding down an aisle of books, keeping one eye on andrew, who concentrates on his work. joe approaches, nonchalantly, as if he just happens to be sauntering by. suddenly he "notices" andrew.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{oh, beckett. how's it goin'?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{fine.}

<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{what?}

<D>__{find a lawyer?}

<C>__{joe}
<D>__{uh huh...}
<A>__{andrew concentrates on his work once more.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{how do you get from one lawyer spotting a lesion, which could have been a bruise, to the partners deducing you had aids and basing a decision to terminate you on that conclusion?}
<A>__{the chinese professor moves away.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{good pointerior}
<A>__{andrew removes a legal pad with "kenton" written in big letters across the top, and lots of notes underneath.}
<C>__{andrew }
<D>__{the partner who spotted the lesion, walter kenton, used to work for benton, myers, in d.c. there's a paralegal there, maria torres. she's had lesions on and off for three years. she says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by aids.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{they didn't fire her?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{no. they didn't fire her.}
<A>__{andrew goes back to his work. joe stands there.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{so kenton connected the... lesion, and whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, maria... and blew the whistle on you. suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. but, up to this point, you've been their golden boy, their rising star... their behavior is... inconsistent.}
