<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{tma 1 excavation air view. rocket bus descending. there are no lights on the actual excavation, only the landing strip and the monitor dome. long shot monitor domes with a bit of excavation in shot. six small figures in space suits slowly walk toward excavation. the party stops at top of tma 1 excavation a small control panel mounted at the head of the ramp. michaels throws a switch and the excavation is suddenly illuminated.}
<C>__{halvorsen}
<D>__{well, there it is.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{can we go down there closer to it?}
<C>__{halvorsen}
<D>__{certainly.}
<B>__{they start down working ramp}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{does your geology on it still check out?}
<C>__{michaels}
<D>__{yes, it does. the sub surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{how can you tell it was deliberately buried?}
<C>__{michaels}
<D>__{by the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{any clue as to what it is?}
<C>__{michaels}
<D>__{not really. it's completely inert. no sound or energy sources have been detected. the surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. a laser drill might do something, but we don't want to be too rough until we know a little more.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{but you don't have any idea as to what it is?}
<C>__{michaels}
<D>__{tomb, shine, survey marker spare part, take your choice.}
<C>__{halvorsen}
<D>__{the only thing about it that we are sure of is that it is the first direct evidence of intelligent life beyond the earth.}
<A>__{silent appreciation.}
<C>__{halvorsen}
<D>__{four million years ago, something, presumably from the stars, must have swept through the solar system and left this behind.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{was it abandoned, forgotten, left for a purpose?}
<C>__{halvorsen}
<D>__{i suppose we'll never know.}
<C>__{michaels}
<D>__{the moon would have made an excellent base camp for preliminary earth surveys.}
<A>__{some more silence.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{any ideas about the colour?}
<C>__{michaels}
<D>__{well, not really. at first glance, black would suggest something sun powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun powered device?}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{has it been exposed to any sun before now?}
<C>__{michaels}
<D>__{i don't think it has, but i'd like to check that. simpson, what's the log on that?}
<B>__{inside monitor dome}
<A>__{we see a number of television displays including several tv views of floyd and company in the excavation.}
<C>__{simpson}
<D>__{the first surface was exposed at 0843 on the 12th april... let me see... that would have been forty five minutes after lunar sun set. i see here that special lighting equipment had to be brought up before any futher work could be done.}
<A>__{tma 1 excavation}
<C>__{michaels}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{and so this is the first sun that it's had in four million years.}
<C>__{photographer}
<D>__{excuse me, gentlemen, if you'd all line up on this side of the walkway we'd like to take a few photographes. dr. floyd, would you thand in the middle... dr. michaels on that side, mr. halvorsen on the other.... thank you.}
<A>__{the photographer quickly makes some exposures.}
<C>__{photographer}
<D>__{thank you very much gentlemen, i will have the base photo section send you copies.}
<A>__{as the men slowly seperate from their picture pose, there is a piercingly powerful series of five electronic shrieks, each like a hideously over loaded and distorted time signal. floyd involuntarily tries to block his ears with his spacesuited hands. then comes mercily silence. various shots of space monitors, asteroids, the sun, pluto, mars}
<C>__{narrator}
<D>__{a hundred million miles beyond mars, in the cold lonliness where no man had yet travelled, deep space monitor 79 drifts slowly among the tangled orbits of the asteroids. radiation detectors noted and analyzed incoming cosmic rays from the galaxy and points beyond; neutron and x ray telescopes kept watch on strange stars that no human eye would eever see; magnetometers observed the gusts and hurricanes of the solar winds, as the sun breathed million mile an hour blasts of plasma into the faces of its circling children.}
<C>__{narrator}
<D>__{all these things and many others were patiently noted by deep space monitor 79, and recorded in its crystalline memory.}
<C>__{narrator}
<D>__{but now it had noted something strange â€“ the fainterior yet unmistakable distrubance rippling across the solar system, and quite unlike any natural phenomena it had ever observed in the past.}
<C>__{narrator}
<D>__{it was also observed by orbiter m 15, circling mars twice a day; and high inclination probe 21, climbing slowly above the planet of the ecliptic; and even artificial comet 5, heading out into the cold wastes beyond pluto, along an orbit whose far pointerior it would not reach for a thousand years.}
<C>__{narrator}
<D>__{all noticed the peculiar burst of energy that leaped from the face of the moon and moved across the solar system, throwing off a spray of radiation like the wake of a racing speedboat.}
