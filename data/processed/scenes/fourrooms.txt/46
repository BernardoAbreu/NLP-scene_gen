<D>__{i want you to turn off the nudie station in our room.}
<A>__{ted checks the computer.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(reading stats on room 716)}
<D>__{i can't turn on an adult station without permission from your parents.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(struggling with winter tights)}
<D>__{not turn it on, turn it off. it's already on.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{that's not what the machine tells me.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{well, stop listening to the machine and listen to me. there's naked ladies dancing on my tv and i want 'em off.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{if you're good, you'll get milk and cookies, so leave me alone, please. i will be up later to put you both to sleep.}
<A>__{he hangs up. room 716 angry, sarah slams down the phone. she has an unusually adult temper. we know where she gets it from. she looks up and sees that the nudies are still in full force.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{change the channel, now!}
<A>__{juancho turns around. he has a face like someone just laid a fart in his nose.}
<C>__{juancho}
<D>__{man, you're the one with the stinky feet.}
<A>__{sarah smells her feet. twice.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{they don't stink.}
<C>__{juancho}
<D>__{yeah, they do.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{here, smell for yourself.}
<A>__{she sticks her foot out for juancho to smell. he's reluctant. fearful.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<A>__{he slowly, very slowly... climbs onto the bed and lowers his head to her foot. very slowly. sarah waits until he's close enough to her foot before she kicks him in the face, sending him somersaulting off the bed and crashing to the floor. she grabs the remote control he left behind and changes the channel to a cartoon. juancho gets up and realizes his defeat. he decides to wander about. looking for something to do... sarah tries to ignore him as he stalks the room. it's only a matter of time before he finds mischief. juancho sees the champagne bucket and bingo!, he goes for the bottle.}
<C>__{juancho}
<P>__{(holding up the bottle)}
<D>__{hey, get a bottle opener!}
<A>__{sarah opens her mouth, as if about to tell him to leave the champagne alone. she stops herself when she realizes she wants some champagne too. she quickly scrambles about for a bottle opener while juancho unwraps the bottle top. sarah opens the dresser drawer with such force that a few hidden contents long forgotten in the back of the drawer slide forward. some coins, a paperclip, and a hypodermic needle. she looks down at the needle that lays beside the gideon bible and casually picks the phone back up and punches 0. the phone rings.}
