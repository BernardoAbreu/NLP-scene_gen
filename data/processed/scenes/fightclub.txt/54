<L>__{interior baggage claim area night}
<A>__{utterly empty of baggage. no people except for jack and a security task force man. the security tfm, smirking, holds a receiver to his ear from an official phone on the wall.}
<C>__{security tfm}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<D>__{throwers don't worry about ticking. modern bombs don't tick.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{excuse me? "throwers?"}
<C>__{security tfm}
<D>__{baggage handlers. but when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{my suitcase was vibrating?}
<C>__{security tfm}
<D>__{nine time out of ten, it's an electric razor. but, every once in a while ...}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{...it's a dildo. it's airline policy not to imply ownership in the event of a dildo. we use the indefinite aricle: "a dildo." never "your dildo."}
<A>__{jack sees, through the window, tyler, at the curb, throwing his briefcase into the back of a shiny, red convertible. tyler leaps over the door into the driver's seat and peels out. jack turns away, looks at the security tfm. in the background, a harried man dashes after tyler and the convertible, screaming.}
