<A>__{fall or early winter day "look" is somewhat under five feet tall, pigeon toed, platter faced and wide eyed. over her arm is a very handsome blanket. she is coming forward shyly toward martin, propelled by a comanche her father. martin, with an armful of trade goods a few yards of bright calico, a couple of aged sow rosettes and some trinkets is indicating the blanket. look glances shyly at her father. he shakes his head negatively. look is disappointed. the father points to martin's pile of trade goods. martin bends and picks up the indicated object: it is a battered high crowned beaver hat. the indian grunts his approval and puts it on. look looks relieved. martin reaches for the blanket. look takes a quick step backward and holds up one finger: wait! then she runs back through the other comanches now crowding forward.}
