<L>__{exterior campus night}
<A>__{the clock tolls two as the boys silently run back to their dorm.}
<L>__{interior keating's classroom day}
<A>__{keating is walking to the front of the classroom filled with students.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{a man is not very tire, he is exhausted. and don't use very sad, use }
<A>__{he points to the back of the classroom.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{come on, mr. overstreet, you twerp,}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{morose?}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{exactly! morose. now, language was developed for one endeavor, and that is? mr. anderson? come on! are you a man or an amoeba?}
<A>__{keating stands before todd's desk. todd looks up nervously but says nothing. keating paused for a moment before looking away.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{mr. perry?}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{uh, to communicate.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{no! to woo women. today we're going to be talking about william shakespeare.}
<A>__{the class lets out a collective sigh.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{oh, god!}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{i know. a lot of you looked forward to this about as much as you look forward to root canal work. we're gonna talk about shakespeare as someone who writes something very interesting. now, many of you have seen shakespeare done very much like this:}
<A>__{keating holds out his right arm dramtically and begins to speak in an exaggerated british accent.}
<D>__{"o titus, bring your friend hither." but if any of you have seen mr. marlon brando, you know, shakespeare can be different. "friend, romans, countrymen, lend me your ears." you can also imagine, maybe, john wayne as macbeth going, "well, is this a dagger i see before me?"}
