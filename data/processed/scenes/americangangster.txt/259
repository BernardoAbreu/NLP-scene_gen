<A>__{floor by floor, they work their way up the tower like commandos, the squalor and decay and hopelessness somehow intensifying the higher up they go. reaching the 17th floor, they listen to a strange sound before easing the fire door open enough to see a kid on a big wheels pedalling straight at them. he passes and the sound fades.}
<L>__{interior 17th floor hallway day}
<A>__{half the apartment doors are gone. tvs and radios echo, voices argue, infants wail. the detectives come around a corner and see at the end of it: a couple of guys with a sawed off shotguns sitting outside a closed door. they step back. consider one other. spearman volunteers with a nod, continues on alone as the others wait. he walks up to the guys with the guns.}

<D>__{get the fuck out of here.}
<C>__{spearman}
<D>__{what the fuck is that? i got business with teddy and it's none of your fuckin business except to knock on the fuckin door and get him.}
<A>__{as the guy stands, pumping the shotgun, spearman yanks it hard against his throat like a garrote, forcing him to the floor. the shotgun explodes, showering plaster and pellets. jones and abruzzo are instantly all over the other guy as richie swings the sledgehammer into the door }
