<L>__{interior event horizon second containment}
<A>__{the second containment is a holocaust. fire swarms over the walls. burning jelly drips from control spikes. the core itself is a blazing orb; the gyroscope that holds it glows red hot. miller stares at the blazing core.}
<C>__{burning man }
<D>__{don't leave me!}
<A>__{miller turns. the burning man stands right beside him. he smashes miller with a backhand that ignites miller's clothes and sends him flying. the detonator falls from miller's grasp, lost beneath two feet of coolant. miller comes up choking and spluttering. the burning man stalks towards miller. the coolant steams and sizzles at his feet. miller stares at the burning man as he approaches. slowly rises to his feet.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{you're not edmund corrick.}
<A>__{the burning man's flames wane, revealing weir's misshapen form. miller throws a wicked right. weir catches miller's fist. squeezes until blood wells up between his fingers. then slings miller against a cooling tank with bone cracking force. miller collapses into the slime, barely able to raise his head to breathe. weir slowly approaches.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{what are you?}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{you know.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{you want me to believe you're the devil, well, i don't, that's bullshit!}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{i'm not the devil.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{then what, what are you? tell me...}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{better if i just show you.}
<A>__{weir's hands reach down and he grabs miller by the skull. miller gasps as he sees...}
<B>__{series of shots}
