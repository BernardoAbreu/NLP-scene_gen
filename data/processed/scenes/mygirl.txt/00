<C>__{mr. bixler}
<D>__{the great way, is not difficult for those with no preferences, with the absence of both love and hate, everything becomes clear and undisguised. that was written by a chinese philosopher in the year 600. now why would i choose to bring that up in a creative writing class? because, the absence of judgment helps us to appreciate reality. in other words, i want you to listen to your classmates writing, with a clear and open heart, okay? so who's gonna go first?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i got one.}
<A>__{he gets up}
<D>__{i sang a song for you to hear, i painted a picture for you to see, i picked a rose for you to smell, i planted grass for you to touch, but you did not hear my song, you did not see my picture, you did not smell my rose and you did not touch my grass. woman maybe she was outta town? guy#2 that's not funny, his poem is about futility, we toil in unrewarded obscurity.}
<C>__{mr. bixler}
<D>__{now, i hear judgment, let's not forget the part about the open heart...}
<A>__{the door at the back of the room opens and vada enters holding a writing pad and pen looking nervous}

<D>__{loads of ice cream by vada sultenfuss i like ice cream a whole lot, it tastes good when days are hot, on a cone or in a dish, this would be my only wish, vanilla, chocolate or rocky road, even with pie a la mode. that's all i got so far.}
<C>__{justin}
<D>__{i hear that vada, flesh all a mush or rocky road, it's about desire.}
<C>__{mr. bixler}
<D>__{vada that's... it's very sweet, and it rhymes and that's also good but, you're not expressing to me what's in your soul. i want you to show me how you see the world, your fears, your desires, your innermost secrets.}

<D>__{it's only a garage, come on.}
<A>__{vada notices that one of her streamers on her bike is gone}
<C>__{vada}
<D>__{hey, one of my streamers is gone! it probably fell off in here.}
<A>__{thomas j walks over to a model of a head}
<C>__{thomas j}
<D>__{hey look at this!}
<C>__{vada}
<D>__{that was grammoo's. it's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. come here, i will diagnose your head.}
<C>__{thomas j}
<D>__{no, i don't wanna.}
<C>__{vada}
<D>__{come on, it's fun.}

<D>__{what do you think it's like?}
<C>__{vada}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{thomas j}
<D>__{heaven.}
<C>__{vada}
<D>__{i think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.}
<C>__{thomas j}
<D>__{but, what if you're afraid to ride horses?}
<C>__{vada}
<D>__{it doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.}
<C>__{thomas j}
<D>__{that doesn't sound so bad, come on, we'll never find that streamer.}
<A>__{as they leave, vada turns back and grabs the photo, then returns to thomas j harry's bedroom, harry is dressing and getting ready for}

<A>__{phil stops}
<D>__{i'm going out with shelly.}

<C>__{harry}
<D>__{the last date i had was twenty years ago.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{that's true. harry harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, "the sexual revolution", now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? bras!}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{oh come on.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{harry, i'm serious, trust me harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every tom dick and harry.}

<D>__{like a sultenfuss. go get 'em.}
<A>__{harry runs down the stairs and passes vada on the way}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{goodnight vada.}
<C>__{vada}
<D>__{dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{ahh, i just wanna look nice.}
<C>__{vada}
<D>__{you never cared before.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{well shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.}
<C>__{vada}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{she likes to play bingo.}
<C>__{vada}
<D>__{can i go too?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{naah, i think you'd better stay here and keep grammoo company.}
<A>__{harry leaves and then vada makes a decision, she goes out the door outside the sennet's house, vada is creeping along night vada approaches the sennet's house and signals through the window for thomas j to come outside, which he does}
<C>__{thomas j}
<D>__{vada? vada?? where are you??}
<A>__{vada springs up from her hiding place}
<C>__{vada}
<D>__{here.}

<D>__{i am not.}
<C>__{vada}
<D>__{bed wetter!}
<C>__{thomas j}
<D>__{i stopped that!}
<A>__{at the church, focus on the bingo announcer who is calling}
<B>__{out the numbers}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{don't worry, there's a strategy to bingo. for instance, on a given night anybody can win, but i play the odds, when choosing bingo cards, i use a range of theories from the laws of probability to avoiding duplicate number systems. this way you get much more activity.}
<C>__{shelly}
<P>__{(hopeful)}
<D>__{does it make it easier to win?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{no. just, more activity.}
<A>__{harry then pulls a seat out and sits down in it, cutting shelly off, who has to pull her own seat out and sit down}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(as he sits down, to the person next to him)}
<D>__{hi carl.}

<B>__{close up of harry and shelly}
<A>__{as shelly looks around the bingo table, she notices that everyone around her is chronologically advantaged in a big way}

<D>__{i just had a terrible thought harry.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what's that?}

<D>__{everybody hold hands, and close your eyes. relax your muscles and take deep breaths.}
<C>__{justin}
<D>__{now, try to feel what the other person is feeling, without speaking any words, send out your vibe, and receive the vibes around you at the same time. can you feel it?}

<D>__{okay, open your eyes. what did everybody feel?}
<C>__{guy}

<D>__{i used to like to play with my ken and barbie dolls, ken was my favorite. then one christmas i got them a camper, and all they wanted to do was hang out in it by themselves. so i wasn't too upset when they took that wrong turn and went over a cliff.}

<C>__{vada}
<D>__{nephritis? it's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{well, i'm no doctor. all i know is, the next day they had really high fevers, and their faces got very fat. they baffled medical science, they were in a magazine.}

<C>__{harry}
<D>__{we're having the wedding sometime near the end of the summer.}
<C>__{vada}
<A>__{not acknowledging harry's comment you'll be okay little fish.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{vada? would you like us to get you another goldfish?}
<C>__{vada}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{no!, he's fine.}
<P>__{(less angry, talking to fish)}
<D>__{fish are very resilient animals you know. don't worry, i won't get another fish.}
<A>__{shelly and harry exchange worried looks, vada doesn't seem to have understood}
<C>__{announcer}
<D>__{the bumper cars!! the bumper cars!! for just 50 cents a half dollar, five dimes, 10 nickels, we have a ride that's guaranteed to rearrange all of your internal organs.}

<D>__{i am gonna get you.}
<A>__{vada straps herself in, shelly turns around and gives vada the thumbs up, vada looks very intent on brutally murdering something now, and she returns the thumbs up, as she does so, music begins to play and the power is turned on, the song is "bad moon rising"}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{vada, keep your hands on the wheel!!}
<A>__{vada rushes straight at shelly and rams into her at top speed, so that shelly's car is spun around a little, shelly screams, this is all in good fun, at the moment. then vada rams her again, and again, and again, and again, and eventually, shelly does not look too pleased, she can't escape vada}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{careful vada, careful.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{shelly look out!}
