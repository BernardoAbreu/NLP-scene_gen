<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{tamara}
<A>__{she awakens to the screaming of a whipped slave girl.}
<L>__{exterior desert day}
<A>__{tamara's eyes are met by a dozen others, slaves of every color, chained together with her in a caged wagon. the slave trader swings his whip twice more, hitting the cowering women in the cage.}
<C>__{slave trader}
<D>__{wake up, slags! smile! a new owner approaches!}
<A>__{tamara makes eye contact with the slave trader.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{let me go. i promise you'll be rewarded.}
<A>__{the trader just laughs, leering at her.}
<C>__{slave trader}
<D>__{and i would sample that reward, fair one, but you wear white.}
<C>__{slave trader }
<D>__{tell me, have the stars aligned and delivered a virgin slave into my care?}
<A>__{he eyes her lasciviously. tamara turns away and does not answer.}
<C>__{slave trader }
<D>__{no matter. i will know soon enough.}
<P>__{(turns away)}
<D>__{good day, sir! a lone rider in a desolate land. the perfect customer for what i sell.}
<B>__{conan}
<A>__{rides out of the sun, his massive form silhouetted by the bright desert sky. he stares at the slave wagons.}
<C>__{shemish woman}
<D>__{please, master! your gold can free me from this hole! i can bring you pleasure }
<A>__{the slave trader immediately whips her, incensed.}
<C>__{slave trader}
<D>__{silence whore!}
<A>__{the slaver goes to whip her again, but before the blow can fall, conan grabs his arm. the slave trader looks furious, but conan's size holds him back.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{khor kalba. which way?}
<C>__{slave trader}
<D>__{this is the road to khor kalba. ahead. past the great wall.}
<A>__{the slaver nods to the east and conan releases his arm. the slaver continues whipping the slave. conan just rides on not his problem. but as conan passes tamara, for a brief moment their eyes meet. something about her. conan stares a moment, then spurs his horse on. just then, the ground around them rumbles. horses rear, the women scream. conan turns and looks up. his eyes go wide.}
<B>__{enormous boulders}
<A>__{coming thundering down the hills on all sides. the slavers see them a moment to late. slam. several of the horses and carts are smashed by the rolling boulders. conan kicks his horse, trying to outrace the boulders. but when the wagon next to him is hit, its axle spears his horse in its side, and conan goes down. pissed, he draws his sword. the slavers scramble around the broken wagons, in chaos. only a pair of wagons still stands. one of them holds tamara.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{use your whips on the horses' legs!}
<A>__{the slavers are confused. then they notice}
<B>__{turanian horsemen}
<A>__{racing down the hill, behind the boulders. as the riders bear down upon the slavers, the slavers do as they're told, entangling the legs of the first wave of horses, throwing their riders. more than a few riders snap their necks as they're driven into the desert floor. the remainder fight hand to hand, and are cut down by either conan's blade or the slavers' tulwars. but their victory is short lived as a second wave of riders comes thundering towards them, before the slavers can re establish their perimeter. the riders start cutting the slavers down where they stand.}
<B>__{conan}
<A>__{conan lodges his sword in a still rolling boulder. as it rolls, it pulls him up on top of it. from this height, conan launches himself down at the horsemen below. wham! he knocks a rider off his horse, conan landing square in the saddle. he kicks the horse straight at the other riders. they don't see him coming until it's too late. he cuts them down where they sit. the last remaining caravan driver whips his horse team, trying to pull his wagon out of the fight. conan spins to see a flash of steel and the rider's neck plumes in blood as he's decapitated. which is strange since the cavalry are nowhere near the wagon.}
<B>__{remo}
<A>__{the explanation comes as the shadow behind the driver morphs into remo, the spindly shadow scout. he takes the reins, stopping the wagon. conan spots him, recognition in his eyes.}
<C>__{conan }
<D>__{you!}
<A>__{there's a scream. conan turns to see the other two shadow scouts already hacking their way through the slaves on one of the caged wagons. a shadow scout gets to tamara, only to have her fight back. tamara kicks the first scout in the face, slamming his head into the bars. however, the second one clubs her unconscious from behind.}
<B>__{conan}
<A>__{leaps from his horse, launching his body at remo. remo dives and rolls away. small and misshapen, he is nonetheless very fast. conan strikes again. again remo dodges out of the way. the shadow scouts draw swords, but remo waves them off, speaking in the broken language of a savage.}
<C>__{remo}
<D>__{the girl! bring her to khalar!}
<A>__{conan launches an all out attack. remo leaps over his sword and vaults conan, landing on his back. he draws his sword, preparing to cut conan's throat when conan hurls his body backwards, into one of the huge rolling boulders. the impact crushes remo and he loses his grip. conan spins to strike again, only to see remo melt into the}
<B>__{shadow of the boulder.}
<A>__{conan turns his attention towards the other two shadow scouts as they drag the unconscious tamara away. conan mounts one of the cavalry horses and gallops towards the scouts. they see him coming and let go of tamara. they}
<B>__{melt away into her shadow and disappear.}
