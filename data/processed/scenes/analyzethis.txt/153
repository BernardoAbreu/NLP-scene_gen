<D>__{you just said it yourself.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{it's different when i say it. when you say it, it sounds very negative.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i'm sorry, jelly, but i'm not going. i'm not on the payroll anymore, so forget about it. my wife is waiting }

<D>__{doc.}
<A>__{ben feels a gun pressed against his back.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you can't shoot me, jelly.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{correction. mr. vitti couldn't shoot you. but here's something about me you should know. i never got married, doctor sobol. i don't have a hobby. i never got a dog or a cat. i don't even have a goldfish. i live for one reason only, and that's to serve mr. paul vitti. he's what i'm thinking about when i wake up, and he's what i'm thinking about when i close my eyes to sleep. if he told me to jump off a tall building, not only would i do it, i would hope to survive so i could do it again and again until he told me to stop. this is all i know. this is all i got. so please don't think i won't kill you, because i'd hate for your last thought to be a wrong one. you're going to that meeting.}
