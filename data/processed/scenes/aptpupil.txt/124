<L>__{interior bowden house living room day}
<A>__{the interview continues. the clock ticks on. richler drinks from a coffeee cup. todd is back in his seat.}
<C>__{richler}
<D>__{todd, let me tell you what we're really interested in here. you told the admitting nurse that denker had a heart attack while you were reading him a letter.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{that's right. i was. that's what i was doing there. it was in german but he insisted i try to read it anyway. once or twice he got pissy about the pronunciation but i asked him what did he want from me. i don't speak german. mr. denker... dussander... got really excited at one pointerior he yelled out, "yes, that's what you would do all right." but i didn't know what he was talking about. then he grabbed his chest.}
<C>__{richler}
<D>__{and that's when you called the ambulance, right?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{richler}
<D>__{well, this is the part we can't figure out. the letter itself, todd... do you remember what happened to it?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i guess it was still on the table. i couldn't swear to it, but }
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{wait, i saw a letter. it was in german. i didn't think anything of it at the time. but, yeah, it was on airmail stationery.}
<C>__{richler}
<D>__{then it should still be there. this is our problem.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{it isn't?}
<C>__{richler}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{maybe somebody broke in.}
<C>__{richler}
<D>__{why would somebody break into his house simply to steal a letter? ...unless... there was someone... someone right here in santo donato who would want to protect him for some reason. maybe a close friend, or even another fugitive. i know it sounds like a bunch of robert ludlum stuff, but when dussander was taken to the hospital, we think our mr. x scooted over to the house and swiped the letter.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{that doesn't make sense.}
<C>__{richler}
<D>__{why not, todd?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{well, if denk... if he had an old nazi buddy in town, why didn't he come over himself and read the letter to him? if you could have heard the way he corrected me at every word }
<C>__{richler}
<D>__{a good pointerior except maybe this other fellow is in a wheelchair, or blind.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{guys that are blind don't normally go scooting out to steal letters.}
<C>__{richler}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{true. did dussander have any friends that you knew of?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{no, not really.}
<C>__{richler}
<D>__{how about phone calls?}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{no, i heard his phone ring maybe five or six times in all the time i knew him. it was never anything out of the ordinary. salesmen. wrong numbers.}
<C>__{richler}
<D>__{did you ever hear him speak german on those occasions?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{no. he hardly ever spoke german. he always said he would teach me someday, but he never got around to it.}
<C>__{weiskopf}
<D>__{did he ever talk about his past?}
<A>__{todd looks at weiskopf. this is the first question he has asked and todd is more wary of him than of richler. todd shrugs innocently.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{not really. little bits, i guess.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{well, don't you remember what he told us at thanksgiving?}
<A>__{todd looks at her.}
<C>__{monica }
<D>__{he said he was in college }
<C>__{dick}
<P>__{(shutting her up)}
<D>__{monica. they don't care what we know, they care what todd knows.}
<A>__{silence. richler notices the tension in the room. he looks at weiskopf. finally, he speaks to dick.}
<C>__{richler}
<D>__{look, i'm sure this whole thing has come as a terrible shock. i think we've done enough for the day.}
<A>__{he and weiskopf stand. dick is almost surprised that they are leaving so soon.}
<C>__{weiskopf}
<D>__{thank you, todd. mr. and mrs. bowden.}
<A>__{weiskopf nods good bye.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{wait a minute... agent richler, before you go todd's not a suspect in this, is he? i mean he's just talking to you, right?}
<C>__{richler}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{because todd always thought he was helping that old man. we didn't know any of this before today.}
<C>__{richler}
<D>__{mr. bowden, you and todd have nothing to worry about. i assure you. your son has been a great service to us. thank you, todd. for now that's all we need. our next step is to turn that house upside down. we're bringing in some special teams to look through everything. we may come up with something. we'll be in touch if we need you.}
<A>__{they are almost to the door, when richler stops.}
<C>__{richler }
<D>__{oh, todd, by the way....}
<P>__{(casually, pulls a photo out of a folder he is carrying)}
<D>__{have you ever seen this man before?}
<A>__{he holds the photo up to todd. it is a picture of archie in military dress, probably a blow up of his military id. todd stares at it for a moment. his face shows no reaction.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{richler}
<D>__{okay, thanks.}
<A>__{he smiles. weiskopf opens the door and the two men leave.}
