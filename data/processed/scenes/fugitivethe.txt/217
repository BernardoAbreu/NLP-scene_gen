<A>__{afternoon light comes in kimble's basement windows. sheets of prosthetic clinic patient material are spread over kimble's bed, floor. kimble searches through the documents, making notes. he studies photos of attachments. cable attachments. joints. electronics. pins. straps... looking for a key to the identity of the one armed man. finally he stops. he finds the flyer in his pocket, puts it on the bedside table and moves to sink. he wets a towel and covers his face. draws a cool damp breath. lays back on bed amid the prosthetic clinic material. flashback fight kimble pulls the arm. it separates in the one armed man's sleeve. wrenches. dis articulates. flashback one armed man reacts in pain. again. (note: we sense kimble's mind returning to something. getting closer to the key...) flashback one armed man escaping the bedroom. we hear his footsteps down the stairs... a door slam. footsteps again. another door slams, but this time the sound is distinctly different... a car door.}
