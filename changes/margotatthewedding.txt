<LOC>__{INT. TRAIN CAR - DAY}
<ACTION>__{A cashier hands a boy, 13, his change across a counter. The boy stuffs the coins in his pocket. He lifts the cardboard tray with two hot dogs, a bag of chips, and two Cokes. This is Claude. We follow him: He carefully carries the meal down the aisle, balances it in one hand as he opens the door. The train noise blares as he traverses the area between cars. He enters the new car repeating the balancing act. He waits while a man shoves his back-pack onto the metal rack above the seats. Claude hurries a bit more now, his concentration alternating between the food and the path. He sits next to a brunette woman.   He hands her a hot dog.}
<CHAR>__{CLAUDE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Here.}
<ACTION>__{He's met by a severe and pinched face. The eyes have black circles -- there is a scar above her lip. Claude instantly blushes and mumbles:}
<CHAR>__{CLAUDE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sorry.}
<ACTION>__{He gets up and hurries a few seats further. He slides next to a pretty brunette woman, late 30's, with straight shoulder length hair. Her name is Margot.}
<CHAR>__{MARGOT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That was quick.}
<CHAR>__{CLAUDE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I sat next to the wrong person.}
<CHAR>__{MARGOT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Really?   Where?}
<ACTION>__{She stretches up and peers over the seats.   He grabs her shirt.}
<CHAR>__{CLAUDE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Please don't look.    She'll see you.}
<CHAR>__{MARGOT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Careful with my blouse.}
<TRANS>__{CUT TO:}
<ACTION>__{Margot is sleeping, her head against the window. Claude listens to his iPod. He takes out the earphones, gets up, and walks to the front of the car. Opens the door and goes between cars. The train roars and screeches. Claude screams.   He stops, looks around. He screams again.}
<TRANS>__{CUT TO:}
<ACTION>__{Claude and his mother gaze out the dirt streaked window at a river. An old castle-like structure emerges from the water. Houses are run-down. In the distance there's a power plant. Electrical lines crisscross the sky. Claude puts his finger against the glass and traces the wires.}

<DIAL>__{Will the wedding be crowded?}
<CHAR>__{MARGOT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{How long has she known Malcolm?}
<CHAR>__{MARGOT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Only a year.}

<CHAR>__{CLAUDE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm not going to ever get married.}
<CHAR>__{MARGOT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I can't say I have a lot of hope for the whole thing.}

<DIAL>__{Why are we going then?}
<CHAR>__{MARGOT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We're supporting her.}
<CHAR>__{CLAUDE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I thought she wasn't speaking to you.}

<DIAL>__{No...no...I wasn't speaking to her, but I'm over it.}
<LOC>__{EXT. FERRY DOCK - DAY}
<ACTION>__{A ferry is docked. Cars pull up onto the boat. Margot runs, clutching a suitcase, holding down a floppy wine colored sun hat. Claude hurries alongside her, a bag slung over his shoulder.}
<LOC>__{EXT. FERRY - DAY}
<ACTION>__{The rumbling and sputtering of the boat.    People get out of their cars and stretch their legs. Claude leans against the rail and lets the spray hit his face. Margot's cell vibrates. The caller ID: HOME. She stuffs the phone in her pocket.}
<CHAR>__{MARGOT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Why aren't you wearing your new shades?}
<CHAR>__{CLAUDE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't think I need them right now.}
<CHAR>__{MARGOT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You begged for those glasses.}
<CHAR>__{CLAUDE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I know, but...I will wear them, I just feel like people might think it's weird that a kid is wearing dark shades.}
<CHAR>__{MARGOT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's ridiculous.}
<ACTION>__{Claude reluctantly takes out a pair of thin wrap-around punk sunglasses and puts them on. He looks around self- consciously.}
<CHAR>__{MARGOT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You look very cool.}

<DIAL>__{Do they know we're here?}
<ACTION>__{A maroon Volvo station wagon peels around a bend and stops across the road. Two eyes peer out from just below the backseat window. A man, 40, in dumpy cargo shorts rolls down the window. He has a small moustache -- he's harried and sweaty. This is Malcolm. He points at Margot and Claude.}
<CHAR>__{MALCOLM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Are you...?}
<LOC>__{INT. VOLVO - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Malcolm drives. He smokes with the window open. Margot is in the passenger seat. In the back, Claude and the girl, Ingrid, sit shyly, their hair blows turbulently in the wind. Ingrid, 11, wears shorts, sandals, and a batik shirt with a panda on it.}

<DIAL>__{Paul apologizes for not coming, she's still getting the house ready.}

<ACTION>__{Malcolm holds up his wrist and shows a knit blue and orange bracelet.}

<CHAR>__{INGRID} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{Oh.     Good.}

<DIAL>__{I had a full beard   for a while and then when I shaved   it I left this part for last, you   know to see how it looked, and...    It's meant to be funny.}

<LOC>__{EXT. HOUSE - DAY}
<ACTION>__{The trunk slams shut. The Volvo is parked in a driveway alongside a grey Colonial house that sits above the water. They lift bags. An old mutt ambles toward them. Pauline emerges from the house. She's pretty like her sister, late 30's. She walks briskly toward them. Margot smiles and opens her arms, but Pauline passes her and dips down to embrace Claude. She kisses him on the lips.}
<CHAR>__{PAULINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're so handsome.}
<ACTION>__{Now she hugs Margot.    They both tear up.   Claude beams.}
<CHAR>__{PAULINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I never thought I'd get you here.}
<ACTION>__{A loud thud. They all turn toward the property fence. A large pile of dead flowers and rotting plants has been dumped into their yard. There's whispering and movement through brush on the other side. Margot looks at Pauline with concern.}
<CHAR>__{PAULINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're arriving in the midst of a drama. Ingrid, make sure Wizard is inside.}

Ingrid sits on her bed observing Claude. She holds a realistic-looking stuffed rooster in an old-style tuxedo.}

<DIAL>__{Well, I didn't know what to --}

<CHAR>__{MARGOT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{He told me.}
<CHAR>__{PAULINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah...}
<ACTION>__{They enter the guest room. The windows are wide open, the curtains blowing, but the room is very neatly made up.}
<CHAR>__{PAULINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm sorry -- with so little time to prepare, we had to put you in Malcolm's storage room --}
<CHAR>__{MARGOT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{This was Becky's room.   Poor Becky.}
<CHAR>__{PAULINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, poor Becky. Now it's a storage room. I've just started to feel like it's our house not my parents. You know?}

<DIAL>__{Our parents.}

<DIAL>__{Of course. It might still smell like paint, but...}
<CHAR>__{MARGOT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I thought he was a musician.}
<ACTION>__{Pauline jimmies down the stiff windows. Margot begins to unpack and hang up clothes in the closet.}
<CHAR>__{PAULINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, music's officially a hobby... He's painting now. And writing letters to newspapers and magazines. He's very meticulous, he'll spend up to a week writing a response to a music review. He's incredibly smart. Maybe too smart. I don't know. We're doing very well.}
<CHAR>__{MARGOT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Good.    I mean, you must be.}
<ACTION>__{Silence.}
<CHAR>__{PAULINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{MARGOT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Wow...}
<CHAR>__{PAULINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, if it sticks. We'll see. I hope so. Things are good. We did a couples seminar two months ago or so in Maine. They give you exercises and things to do. I know you're not convinced, but...}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(vaguely)}
<DIAL>__{Mm hm.}
<CHAR>__{PAULINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We got engaged right afterwards. The guy who runs it, Strickland, wrote a really interesting book about loving which I'll lend you if you want.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(non-committal)}
<DIAL>__{Okay.}
<CHAR>__{PAULINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But only if you'll read it. Because I need it back. I made notes in the margins.}

<DIAL>__{I may not get to it for a while.}
<CHAR>__{PAULINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, I'm not going to lend it to you if you're not going to read it.}
<ACTION>__{They meet eyes.   Pauline quickly turns away.}
<CHAR>__{PAULINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's going to be very informal by the way. Just Mom and Becky. Malcolm's brother. Few friends. And now you and Claude. Nothing like the first one.}

<DIAL>__{I wasn't angry. I was...disappointed.}
<CHAR>__{MARGOT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Uh huh. But you see when you say, "disappointed" it puts me in a crummy situation. Like I let you down.}
<CHAR>__{PAULINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But you did in a way.}
<CHAR>__{MARGOT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't see it like that.}
<CHAR>__{PAULINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Fine. I felt betrayed.    Is that word okay?}

<CHAR>__{MALCOLM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
