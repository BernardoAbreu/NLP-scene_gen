<A>__{it is a slightly smaller and less lavish edition of sheldrake s office. sheldrake ushers bud through the door, points to the chair behind the desk.}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{sit down. try it on for size.}
<A>__{bud obeys like an automaton, lowers himself into the chair.}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{you like?}
<P>__{(indicating office)}
<D>__{it's all yours.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{mine?}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{my assistant, roy thompson, has been shifted to the denver office, and you're taking his place.}
<P>__{(no reaction from bud)}
<D>__{what's the matter, baxter? you don't seem very excited.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast i'm very pleased especially for miss kubelik. now that i've gotten to know her better, i think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody }
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{oh, sure, sure. but first the property settlement has to be worked out then it takes six weeks in reno meanwhile, i'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.}
<P>__{(starts back toward his own office)}
<D>__{oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room }
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{he removes his dark glasses reflectively.}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{that's just one of the privileges that goes with this job. you also get a nice little expense account, the use of the executive washroom }
<P>__{(breaks off, peers at bud's face)}
<D>__{say, what happened to you, baxter?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i got kicked in the head, too.}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{oh?}
<A>__{with a shrug, he exits into his own office, closing the door behind him. bud sits there, unconsciously bending the glasses in his hand until they suddenly snap in two. bud glances down at the two broken halves, as though surprised by his own violence, tosses them on the desk.}
