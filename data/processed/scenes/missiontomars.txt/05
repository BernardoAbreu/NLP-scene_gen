<L>__{exterior the back yard. late afternoon}
<A>__{luke moves through the crowd. phil and the kids are still shooting off rockets. red streaks arc high overhead. in the back corner of the yard, where it's quieter, he passes willis, who's sitting on a blanket, murmuring soulfully to pretty girl #2.}
<C>__{willis}
<D>__{deep space is so lonesome. so cold. but i guess i will have my memories to keep me warm...}
<A>__{luke shakes his head. willis is incorrigible. finally he reaches a tall redwood playset. he looks up the ladder. a small boy sits on the platform of the tower, arms around his knees, staring up at the stars. a telescope rests nearby on a tripod. he looks lonely. luke climbs up, sits down on the wooden deck next to him. bobby, 7, glances over at his dad, his idol, then back at the sky.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{who's gonna read to me now, at bedtime?}
<A>__{luke is surprised by the question. a pause.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{mommy will.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i like when you do it. now we're never gonna finish our book.}
<A>__{his voice is unexpectedly fierce. he's fighting back tears. luke is moved. another brief silence.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{well, i will tell you what. i've been thinking about that. and what i thought was how 'bout if i bring along my own copy?}
<P>__{(bobby looks at him)}
<D>__{then every night, wherever i am, i will read a little bit more of it. and i will know that you and mommy, wherever you are, you're reading it too. that way, it'll feel like we're still reading it together. 'cause i don't know about you, but i'm pretty anxious to find out how 'ol ben gunn got marooned on that island. what d'you say?}
<A>__{bobby manages a smile. he nods, feeling a little better. luke is proud of his son's courage.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{good deal. can i have a hug?}
<A>__{bobby's arms go around his father's neck. he hugs luke fiercely, and luke hugs him back. his eyes, over the thin young shoulders, are brimming with love and impending absence. then, from the distance, the sound of an approaching car. they both turn. an open jeep is coming down the street. its driver is alone. luke's expression changes. recognition, then happiness.}
