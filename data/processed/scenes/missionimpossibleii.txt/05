<L>__{ext face of mountain (day)}
<A>__{for a moment it might be thought part of the same range when the plane crashed but when ethan hunt climbs into frame the angle widen and titles down, revealing more of where he's come from than where he's going. aside from the fact that he's in the midst of free climbing what is easily a sheer rock face of at least a thousand feet, there's the sunny picture postcard view of a lovely valley and pellucid lake thousands of feet below. ethan climbs out of shot. wide up angle (day) revealing the summit, a light breeze hitting the lichen and whatever growth has a slender purchase on the rocky mountainside, fluffy clouds overhead. ethan into shot. despite the spectacularly precarious handholds he's using to hang onto the mountain and his life, he appears relaxed, engaged for him in the equivalent of busman's holiday. it's leisurely danger for ethan; one might almost expect to hear julie andrews trilling 'climb every mountain' on the soundtrack. then a rock he's been grasping crumbles and ethan drops about six inches before he grabs onto the mountain again. as he hangs by five fingers thousands of feet above the earth he doesn't seem terribly concerned until he spots a helicopter. it's materialized behind the summit and passes surprisingly close just overhead, casting its shadow downward over ethan. instinctively, ethan flattens himself against the rock surface, as if the copter poses some sort of threat to him. but when its rotors whir it into the distance ethan relaxes and resumes his climb. a hairy overhang (exterior mountain day) near the summit ethan departing from the vertical and is now traversing the mountain with more of his back than his feet exposed to the earth far below. he's clinging to the mountain almost like a fly walking on the ceiling. when he reaches for a handhold that will restore him to the vertical, he dislodges a lizard and manages to catch it before it plunges thousand of feet to oblivion.}

<A>__{he pockets the lizard, climbs the overhang. reverse angle summit with ethan's hand, then ethan coming into view and making the summit. he reaches into his pocket and releases the lizard who favors ethan with a stern reptilian stare by way of gratitude. to lizard:}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{you're welcome.}
<A>__{the lizard scampers off, then a low beeping sound at his back attracts his attention. he turns to see the source of the beeping, a small package in day glo colors with a day glo streamer. ethan looks to the sky where the helicopter is now ominously circling back. ethan lifts the day glo package and waves it in the direction of the copter. with a distinct lack of enthusiasm. the helicopter once again turns, banks and disappears. ethan has opened the beeping package and finds a pair of sunglasses. ethan's pov sunglasses first, a retinal scan.}

<C>__{ethan }
<D>__{ won't be on holiday.}
<A>__{ethan, with a fair amount of disgust, gets to his feet and jumps off the mountain, in, what for a moment looks like a suicidal snit. then, somewhere hundreds of feet below camera, there's a little puff of color as the tulip shaped chute pops out of his back pack. begin the sound of a castanets and the animal like cries of flamenco dancers.}
