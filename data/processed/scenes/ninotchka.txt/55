<A>__{panning shot staircase in ninotchka's tenement house it is an overcrowded house. people are walking up and down stairs, standing grouped in front of the various apartments; children are sliding down the banisters and playing games under the feet of the adults. ninotchka trudges upstairs wearily. camera pans with her as she goes into an apartment which is divided into several sub apartments. finally she opens the door of her own room and goes in. ninotchka's room it is a comparatively small room, which she shares with two other girls. as she enters only one girl is present. it is anna, a cello player, who sits on the edge of her bed practicing on her cello. apparently ninotchka has not adjusted herself completely to the moscow which she once thought so great.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{good evening, anna.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{good evening, ninotchka.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{aren't you late?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.}
<A>__{during the following scene anna puts her cello in its case and gets ready to go to her job. ninotchka starts to arrange the table in the center of the floor for a party of four. out of her cupboard she takes very primitive looking dishes, a flower pot, glasses, and a kind of shawl which serves as a tablecloth.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{didn't you march?}
<A>__{anna is apparently not a fanatical believer in the bolshevik regime and takes a cynical and humorous attitude toward it.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{they didn't let me. i am in disgrace. last week at the performance of carmen i played a sour note. the conductor got so excited he yelled, "there's sabotage in the string section!"}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{too bad... you missed an inspiring day, anna.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. when all the tanks and guns were roaring over the red square i sat here all by myself and played a beethoven sonata. not bad at all.}
<P>__{(she has noticed}
<D>__{ninotchka's}
<P>__{preparations)}
<D>__{are you expecting someone?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{a few friends... just a little dinner party.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what are you serving?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{an omelet.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(puzzled)}
<D>__{an omelet! aren't you living a little above your ration?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{well, i've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it just goes to prove the theory of our state. if you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if you're true to the collective spirit and stick together you've got an omelet.}
<P>__{(devilishly)}
<D>__{that reminds me... have you heard the latest they're telling about the kremlin?}
<A>__{at this moment a door to one of the adjoining rooms opens and gurganov, a middle aged man with a sour stool pigeon expression, walks quietly through the room to another door, taking in the girls with one sly glance and giving the impression that not only his eyes but his ears are open. anna breaks off her remark.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{i will tell you later.}
<P>__{(after gurganov has}
<D>__{disappeared into the other room she}
<P>__{continues)}
<D>__{that gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the secret police.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{you should be more careful, anna.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{and you too, ninotchka.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(amazed)}
<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{ever since you have been back from paris...}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{i haven't talked to anyone about paris. i haven't said a word.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{that's just it. it makes people feel queer. i dont' want you to get in any trouble.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{i have nothing to hide.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you should. i will show you.}
<A>__{she walks over to her cupboard and takes out a piece of lingerie and comes back to ninotchka with it.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{when i passed through the laundry yard today i saw all the women huddled around this so i brought it up here. things like this create a bad feeling. first they didn't know whose it was. then they saw the paris label and did it start a commotion! some said it's what we all ought to wear and others said it's like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline. it undermines our whole cause.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(aware of the pettiness which surrounds her)}
<D>__{i see.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter revolution.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{thank you, anna. i will dry it up here when i wash it nexterior i should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(confidentially)}
<D>__{ninotchka, you know i am your friend, you can trust me.... did you bring back anything else?}
<A>__{ninotchka suddenly is transported to paris in her memory.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(with feeling)}
<D>__{no, i left everything in paris. i just happened to be wearing this.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{tell me... what else did you have?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(enjoying the thought)}
<D>__{well, a hat...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what was it like?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{it was very silly.... i would be ashamed to wear it here.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{as beautiful as that? what else? come, tell me.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{an evening gown.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(puzzled)}
<D>__{evening gown?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{a dress you wear in the evening.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what do you wear in the morning?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{when you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{now, ninotchka, you're exaggerating.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{no, my dear, it is true. that's how they live in the other world. here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{and there?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(fingering the piece of lingerie)}
<D>__{they must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{you feel it, though.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(hesitantly)}
<D>__{ninotchka, i wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{what is it, anna?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you know i told you that pavlov and i are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. would it be asking too much...}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{you want this?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{just for the honeymoon.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{you can have it for good. it is my wedding present.}
<A>__{anna is for a moment speechless over this generous gift. she embraces and kisses ninotchka.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{ninotchka! ninotchka!}
<A>__{she kisses her again, takes her cello, and starts to leave.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{am i going to play that cadenza tonight!}
<A>__{anna exits, closing the door. ninotchka is left alone. her thoughts are still in the other world, obviously with leon. mechanically she looks over the table to see if everything is all right, then she walks over to the radio (a primitive little machine). as she turns the knob she smiles again reminiscently. as she does, the blare of a russian speech brings her back to reality.}
<C>__{voice on radio}
<D>__{individuals? yes, as atoms in the cosmos of soviet russia. family? yes. one great family of one hundred and sixty million, struggling, fighting, victorious russian proletarians. thus shall we pursue our way into the future, fists clenched, hearts encased in steel armed against bourgeois sentimentality and...}
<A>__{quickly she turns the knob and again there is a burst of russian oratory.}
<B>__{second voice on radio}
<A>__{...from the exploiters for the toilers. we are going full steam ahead through industrialization toward socialism. let us put the union of socialistic soviet republics into an automobile and the muzhik into a tractor, and then let the capitalists try to keep up with us! the same thing happens for a third time.}
<B>__{third voice on radio}
<A>__{...and thirty million peasants, eighty five per cent of the population owned three hundred forty three million four hundred and sixty nine thousand acres of land, sixty five per cent of the total area. and one hundred and fifty thousand nobles possessed thirty five per cent of the country's natural wealth! ninotchka turns off the radio. she closes her eyes for a moment and with a sad smile murmurs to herself.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{no music.}
<A>__{at this moment the door opens, and buljanoff, iranoff, and kopalski enter. there follow warm greetings between ninotchka and the three russians.}
<C>__{all three russians}
<D>__{ninotchka! ninotchka!}
<A>__{a moment of silence follows. the four look at each other as people do who share a secret.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(with great warmth)}
<D>__{how are you, you three scoundrels?}
<C>__{kopalski}
<P>__{(wryly)}
<D>__{well, we're back home.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<P>__{(sourly)}
<D>__{you know what they say there's nothing like home.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{that's right... and we might as well face it.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(trying not to say what she feels)}
<D>__{come, now, you must not talk that way.... you have to adjust yourselves.... we must be brave.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{brave... that's right.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{let's be happy that we're all alive.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{and that's something we owe to ninotchka.}
<C>__{kopalski}
<D>__{if you hadn't given commissar razinin such a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened?}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{i can tell you exactly.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{now let's forget everything except that we're together.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{let's do that.}
<C>__{kopalski}
<P>__{(falling in with her attempt)}
<D>__{it's a real paris reunion.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{if you close your eyes and listen to our voices we might be in paris.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{let's not close our eyes. there are many good things to see here too.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<P>__{(cynically)}
<D>__{i think i need my glasses.}
<C>__{kopalski}
<P>__{(reprimanding him quietly)}
<D>__{a little more tact... look how nicely she's fixed the table all for us.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<P>__{(in a loud voice,}
<D>__{trying to make up}
<P>__{for his faux pas)}
<D>__{how nicely you've fixed the table, ninotchka.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{what a lovely room you have here.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{how many families live here with you?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{only myself and two other girls. one is a cello player in the opera and the other a street car conductor.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{just three people in a room this size? whew!}
<C>__{kopalski}
<P>__{(inspecting the room)}
<D>__{and your own gas cooker? that's marvelous!}
<P>__{(forgetting himself)}
<D>__{naturally it's not the royal suite...}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{sssh! once and for all, we're in moscow!}
<C>__{kopalski}
<P>__{(walking over to the window)}
<D>__{yes, there's no doubt of that...}
<P>__{(sarcastically)}
<D>__{just look out of the window and there it is.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{and it's great! think what it was a few years ago and what it is now.}
<A>__{iranoff and buljanoff have joined them at the window.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{she's right...}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{just see how happy the people look... from here....}
<C>__{kopalski}
<D>__{can you blame them?... at least the may day parade is over.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{that's another thing... it's spring.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{the same spring we had in paris. just as good.}
<C>__{kopalski}
<D>__{even the swallows are back.}
<C>__{buljanoff and iranoff}
<D>__{yes, that's right.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{maybe that's the same swallow we saw in paris!}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{it is, ninotchka! it is! he must have been in paris! you can see it in his whole attitude! he just picked up a crumb of our black bread, shook his head, and dropped it.}
<C>__{kopalski}
<D>__{if you asked him why he left france i bet he couldn't name one good reason.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{i should be a swallow! right now i would be sitting in front of the cafe de paris picking up flakes of french pastry that would melt in my bill.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{now, comrades... there is something better in life than crumbs of french pastry.}
<C>__{kopalski}
<P>__{(the realist)}
<D>__{yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{we will get that... we'll get everything... maybe a little bit later but we'll get it... we must be patient... finally we got the spring, didn't we? we got the swallows, and you will get your apfel strudel too.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<P>__{(consolingly)}
<D>__{and if it is too late for you your children will eat it.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<P>__{(breaking the mood)}
<D>__{let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet.}
<C>__{kopalski}
<D>__{that's right.}
<P>__{(he takes a little box out of his pocket)}
<D>__{here's my egg.}
<P>__{(he hands it to ninotchka)}
<A>__{iranoff unties his egg from his handkerchief.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{and here's mine.}
<A>__{he hands it to ninotchka. buljanoff reaches in his pocket and from his expression we see that a catastrophe must have happened.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{comrades... i'm out of the omelet.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{don't worry... there will be enough.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{come, ninotchka, let's make it in real parisian style!}
<A>__{the group all go to the gas cooker and ninotchka starts to make the omelet. the others stand around as though they were watching a great event.}
<C>__{kopalski}
<D>__{let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{...des raisins de madere, des framboises...}
<P>__{(...with grapes of}
<D>__{madeira, with}
<P>__{raspberries...)}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{...des petites fraises des bois... de la creme de bretagne...}
<P>__{(...with small wild}
<D>__{strawberries... with}
<P>__{cream...)}
<C>__{kopalski}
<D>__{...so it blows up that big... what they call an omelette surprise!}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{and the surprise is there's nothing in it.}
<C>__{kopalski}
<D>__{i know, but if we can't put in all these wonderful things at least let's put in some imagination.}
<P>__{(he raises his voice)}
<D>__{in that one omelet we'll taste the whole of paris!}
<A>__{the door through which gurganov disappeared opens and gurganov comes out.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<P>__{(seeing him)}
<D>__{sssh!}
<A>__{the conversation stops. gurganov walks quietly through the room, again observing everything. he goes out at last.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{a man like that... all he has to do is to walk through a room and the omelet drops.}
<A>__{there is a dead silence. all are again aware of the reality which surrounds. they concentrate quietly on the frying pan.}
