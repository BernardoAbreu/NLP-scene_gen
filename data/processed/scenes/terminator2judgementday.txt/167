<L>__{73a sarah is in another sally port corridor. a jail cell type barred}
<A>__{door is between her and the corridors of the ward beyond. she sprints to the walls of bars, jams her key into the door. she unlocks and pulls open this door just as she hears the latch of the one she just came through being unlocked. she flings herself frantically through the barred door as the first orderly comes through behind her. she slams the bars shut. clang. her keys are dangling from the lock on the other side from her. the orderly is racing at her, white lipped with rage. she reaches back through the bars, turns the key, and purposefully snaps it off in the lock. an instant later the big orderly slams against the door, grabbing through the bars for her as she dances back just out of reach. he lunges against the steel bars, unbelievably pissed off. sarah takes off running, looking back at the frustrated orderlies. they're shouting at each other, unable to fit their keys into the lock the broken off key tip makes it impossible to get their keys in. silberman shouts at them.}

<A>__{the orderlies run back the way they came, and along a cross corridor to another set of doors.}
