<D>__{andrew marsh was a very wealthy man. a trial like this is going to put cardenas in the spot light.}
<C>__{sattler}
<D>__{we've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten. i'd like you to go with her.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{i'm supposed to be on vacation.}
<C>__{sattler}
<D>__{i know but she wants you to represent her if cardenas files.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{sattler}
<D>__{because i told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{raymond, i'm the only criminal attorney you have.}
<C>__{sattler}
<P>__{(jokingly)}
<D>__{well, i guess that makes you the best.}
<P>__{(candidly)}
<D>__{look, frank she stands to inherit three million dollars. as executors of the estate and her attorneys that could generate a lot of legal fees for us. all i'm asking you to do is talk to her.}
<A>__{dulaney thinks about it for a moment.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{alright, i will talk to her}
<C>__{sattler}

<A>__{dulaney stands and walks towards the door.}
<C>__{sattler}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you know, i knew andrew marsh for almost twenty years or thought i did. what do you think would make a man in his condition do the things he did?}
<A>__{dulaney stops at the door and looks back.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{i think the question is: what is it about her that made him want to do it?}
