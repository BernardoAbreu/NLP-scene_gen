<A>__{peter hurries down the corridor, passing by a nurse. the same one who bandaged miranda earlier, so let's give her a proper name: claire. she pushes her cart into the elevator.}
<L>__{interior third floor corridor day}
<A>__{claire and her cart emerge from the elevator and she heads down the long corridor, reaches a door and unlocks it.}
<L>__{interior medical supply room}
<A>__{tight on a row of drug filled shelves. claire parks her cart and kicks off her shoes. digs a pack of smokes out of her stashed purse when a pair of hands grab her. claire squeaks until she sees her attacker: a stoner type named simon. deftly unbuttoning her uniform, hands all over her. she means to resist but he's got such boyish charm.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{get off me, you dog }
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{hell, don't go all bubbly with joy or anything.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{you can't be in here and you know it. nap in your car.}
<A>__{she finally twists herself out of his grasp. points an accusing finger, but she's grinning. blushing, even.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{now get out before we get busted.}
<A>__{properly reprimanded, simon picks up his folded uniform and prepares to leave, head hung low.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{you slay me, claire. honest.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{sure i do, boy scout.}
<A>__{he exits. she shakes her head, slips her uniform back on.}
