<L>__{exterior military base hospital night}
<A>__{rafe is sitting at the bench, his head down. angle evelyn on the path; she sees someone on the bench, his form hauntingly familiar. he hears her, and looks up. it's rafe. from evelyn's pov, the whole world spins. she faints. rafe jumps to catch her before she slams to the ground. he gathers her into his arms, and she looks up into his face. he's real, very real.}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{evelyn.}
<A>__{she's trembling, shaking. he lifts her to her feet, and moves her to the bench.}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{i sent telegrams, i guess the military traffic held them up.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{why were you sitting here, instead of...}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{i saw you, i couldn't go in, i...just stood there wondering if you knew. you looked...sad, and i had to sit down a minute.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{how did you?...}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{...survive? i jumped in a patch of fog, and nobody could see me. i hit the water hard. and it was so...cold.}
<A>__{he looks toward the horizon, when the last light of day fades to black. there's something he thinks about saying, and doesn't. then...}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{i don't know how long i was in the water. a norwegian freighter picked me up. they were headed to spain. they docked in la rota, right beside a german ship, and told me to stay hidden below. i was afraid they'd turn me in, so i stole some clothes, jumped ship, and found a church, where the priest contacted the resistance, and got me on a freighter to new york.}
<A>__{he looks at her, then looks down again.}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{i called my folks, then colonel doolittle. the colonel sent a man to pick me up. they wanted to debrief me. i told the colonel i needed to see somebody first, and he had a supply flight heading out in an hour.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i've done a lot of talking. you haven't said anything.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{i'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay. you are okay, aren't you?}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{nothing that won't heal. i guess.}
<A>__{at these words, she looks at him for a long, long moment.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{it's been...so different, being so sure you were dead.}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{i'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but i'm back.}
<A>__{he sees the troubled look on her face.}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{maybe i've assumed too much. has something changed?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm afraid to ask what. and i'm afraid not to.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{have you fallen in love?}
<A>__{she nods; she can't even say it. rafe's dying inside.}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{it's all right. danny always said i see things with my emotions instead of my eyes.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{it's not your fault, rafe. the letter i wrote you, they }
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{don't worry about that. guys away from home, lonely, good hearted women try to cheer them up.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{it's not that i didn't mean everything i wrote. it's just that i thought you were dead. and now }
<A>__{danny runs up, through the darkness.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{you're alive!}
<A>__{rafe and danny stare at each other; danny hesitates, looking from rafe to evelyn, wondering what they've said. then rafe looks at evelyn, and picks up the look on her face. in that moment he puts it all together.}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{aw, god. oh my god.}
<A>__{danny's speechless, and for a moment evelyn is too.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{rafe }
<A>__{he puts up a hand, to silence her, and walks away suddenly. evelyn and danny are left frozen.}
