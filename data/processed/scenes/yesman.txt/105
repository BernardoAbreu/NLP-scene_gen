<L>__{exterior fancy restaurant}
<A>__{carl's outside with peter.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{nice job with renee. she's definitely odd, but that's not necessarily }
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i just spent $1500 on dinner.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{what? why?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{because the waiter asked me if i wanted the expensive wine and you weren't there to stop me!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{don't get mad at me about it. you can just stop.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{no i can't. if i didn't say yes to the band flier, i never would have met renee. if i hadn't said yes to taking charge of bank day care and then yes to becoming a loan specialist and then yes to the president's golf trip, i wouldn't be moving up. each yes leads to the next one. if i stop, it could all fall apart.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{you've gone from a passive guy who always said no to a passive guy who always says yes. just saying yes is not a legitimate life philosophy.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i don't know why i should be taking advice from a guy who's wife is pissed he's not involved at all with the wedding planning.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i'm involved.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{you told her you don't care whether the invite's cream or ivory.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i can't see the difference.}
<P>__{(opening up)}
<D>__{honestly, i'm terrified.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{what? why?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{it's marriage, you know? the biggest thing ever.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{but you guys have dated for years.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{you're perfect for each other.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{she's terrified too.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{of course she is. i think you'll both be a lot less terrified if you're terrified together.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{but what if i really can't tell the difference between ivory and cream? does that make me a bad husband?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{what matters is that you pretend you can see the difference.}
<A>__{the girls and seb come out from the restaurant with their coats on. there's a silent beat.}
<C>__{girls}
<P>__{(high pitched goodbyes)}
<D>__{it was wonderful meeting you! i loved it! let me know when you throw your next art thing!}
<A>__{everyone gets into their cars. carl and renee walk off.}
<C>__{renee}
<D>__{it was great meeting your friends.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{they're a little stiff.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{renee}
<D>__{they are a little stiff. what do you feel like doing?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i'm actually going rollerblading with ralph.}
<C>__{renee}
<D>__{ralph?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{you know, crazy rollerblading guitar man.}
<C>__{renee}
<D>__{the guy who plays at the promenade?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{any interest?}
<C>__{renee}
<D>__{no. it's ten on a friday night. and that guy's crazy. don't you want to go home and make out?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{yes.}
