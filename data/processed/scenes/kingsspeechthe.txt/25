<L>__{interior logue's consultation room day}
<A>__{a totally different universe from the spartan waiting area. a world of books piles of them spilling everywhere. two slightly shabby, but comfortable armchairs. well worn turkish rug. hotplate and two chipped mugs. model airplanes hanging from the ceiling. recording apparatus. the walls are pearl grey and smoky blue.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{my wife's favorite colours.}
<A>__{here, in a doctor's office, bertie's stutter returns.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{glad we have something in common.}
<A>__{bertie's head bangs into one of the models.}
<C>__{lionel }
<D>__{my lads build them. make yourself comfortable.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{please...}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{you're too close. five paces is the rule of thumb.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{that might be difficult in this office.}
<A>__{bertie perches uneasily on the edge of an armchair.}
<C>__{lionel }
<D>__{nice girl, anna. worried she wouldn't find a husband if she couldn't speak. tried to convince her men will find her even more attractive as a silent partner. the perfect woman. sorry, bad australian joke. why'd your wife change her mind and ask for an appointment?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i can't discuss that.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{what can we talk about?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{that's better. when speaking with a royal one waits for the royal to start the conversation and chose the topic.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{your joking. that won't work here.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i admit if one waits for me to start a conversation one can wait a rather long time.}
<A>__{silence. they stare at each other.}
<C>__{bertie }
<D>__{you call this making me comfortable?}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{you call this being forthcoming?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{aren't you interested in treating me?}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{only if you're interested in being cured.}
<A>__{more silence.}
<C>__{lionel }
<D>__{cuppa tea?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{no thank you.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{i need one.}
<A>__{turns on the hot plate.}
<C>__{lionel }
<D>__{any idea what you're letting yourself in for?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{apparently a great deal of rudeness, doctor logue.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{call me lionel.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i prefer doctor.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{i prefer lionel. my family calls me far worse. what shall i call you?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{the duke of york is appropriate.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{oh please.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{your royal highness then.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{much more informal.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{prince albert? or frederick? arthur? george? i've lots of names to choose from.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{how about bertie?}
<C>__{bertie}
<P>__{(flushes)}
<D>__{only my family uses that.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{that's what i will call you then. we must be true equals.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{if we were equal i wouldn't be here, i'd be at home with my family and no one would give a damn.}
<A>__{bertie starts to light a cigarette from a silver case.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{don't do that.}
<A>__{bertie gives him an astonished look.}
<C>__{lionel }
<D>__{sucking smoke into your lungs will kill you.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{my physicians say it's good for stuttering, relaxes the throat.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{they're idiots.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{they've all been knighted.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{makes it official then. house rules: no smoking.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i thought here we're "equal".}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{as a monarchist i thought you'd appreciate these are my digs and here i rule. no smoking. what was your earliest memory?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i beg your pardon?}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{first recollection of the world?}
<C>__{bertie}
<P>__{(stutter growing in intensity)}
<D>__{i'm not here to discuss personal matters.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{why're you here then?}
<C>__{bertie}
<P>__{(exploding)}
<D>__{because i bloody well stutter! and you bloody well can't fix it!!!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{temper.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{one of my numerous faults.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{do you stutter when you think?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{don't be ridiculous.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{one of my many faults. how about when you talk to yourself?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i don't talk to myself!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{come on, everyone natters to themselves once in a while, bertie.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{stop calling me that!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{shan't call you anything else.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{then we shan't speak!}
<A>__{silence. the jug has boiled. lionel makes himself a cup of tea.}
<C>__{bertie }
<D>__{must i pay for this?}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{loads. now: when you talk to yourself, do you stutter?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{of course not!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{proving your impediment isn't a permanent internal fixture.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{when i give a speech...i bloody stutter!!!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{bet you a bob you can read flawlessly, right here, right now.}
<C>__{bertie}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{easy money. you're on.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{see your shilling then.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{royals don't carry money.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{how convenient.}
<A>__{logue fishes a coin from his pocket and puts it on the table.}
<C>__{lionel }
<D>__{i will stake you. pay me back next time.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{if there is a next time.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{correct, i haven't agreed to take you on.}
<A>__{during this, logue has uncovered a piece of apparatus, a recording device with earphones. he sets a blank disc onto the turntable and positions a microphone, then hands bertie an open book. bertie glares at it defiantly.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i certainly can't read the bard.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{`easy money'.}
<A>__{bertie reads, stuttering badly and getting worse.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{"to be or not to be, that is the question. whether it is wiser..." there!}
<A>__{reaches for the coin.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{not so fast.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i proved i can't read.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{you proved you can't listen.}
<A>__{hands bertie a pair of heavily padded earphones. bertie doesn't want to take them.}
<C>__{lionel }
<D>__{a princely bob is at stake.}
<A>__{bertie reluctantly puts on the earphones. logue turns a dial. loud music is heard. bertie takes off the earphones. the music stops.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{you're playing music.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{i'm aware.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{how can i hear what i'm saying?!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{bertie, you're royal. surely a prince's brain knows what its mouth is doing?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{you're not well acquainted with royal princes, are you?}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{i want to demonstrate that when you can't hear your voice, you don't stutter, thus proving your impediment is not innate.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{rubbish.}
<A>__{bertie replaces the earphones. again, the loud music. his lips move as he reads, but all that can be heard is the music. finished reading the passage he takes off the earphones and the music ceases. he reaches for the coin, but logue snatches it.}
<C>__{bertie }
<D>__{i was terrible.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{flawless.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i know how i sound!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{would i lie to a prince of the realm to win twelve pence?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i've no idea what an australian might do for that sort of money.}
<A>__{logue puts the record in a brown paper dust jacket and hands it to bertie.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{souvenir of our first and presumably last encounter.}
<A>__{bertie glances at the record. pov the label: hmv his master's voice.}
