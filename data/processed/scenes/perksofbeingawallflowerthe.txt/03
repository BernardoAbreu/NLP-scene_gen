<A>__{it is a neat and tidy little room. few posters or books. charlie is 15. he is innocent, hopeful, awkward, and likable to everyone but his classmates. he sits at his desk, writing a letter in pencil as he tapes the title song through the radio on his cassette boom box.}

<D>__{dear friend, i am writing to you because she said you listen and understand and didn't try to sleep with that person at that party even though you could have. please don't try to figure out who she is because then you might figure out who i am, and i don't want you to do that. i just need to know that people like you exist. like if you met me, you wouldn't think i was the weird kid who spent time in the hospital. and i wouldn't make you nervous.}
