<L>__{interior leonard's office day ##black and white sequence##}
<A>__{leonard, in a cheap suit and tie, gets up from behind his desk to shake hands with mrs. jankis. they talk, leonard nodding as he listens. mrs. jankis is crying.}
<C>__{leonard }
<D>__{she told me about life with sammy, how she'd treated him. it had got to the point where she'd get sammy to hide food all around the house, then stop feeding him to see if his hunger would make him remember where he'd hidden the stuff. she wasn't a cruel person, she just wanted her old sammy back.}
<A>__{the tearful mrs. jankis gives leonard a determined look.}
<C>__{mrs. jankis}
<D>__{mr. shelby, you know all about sammy and you decided that he was faking }
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{mrs. jankis, the company's position isn't that sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown }
<C>__{mrs. jankis}
<D>__{i'm not interested in the company position, mr. shelby. i want to know your honest opinion about sammy.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{we shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.}
<C>__{mrs. jankis}
<D>__{i'm not appealing the decision.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{then why are you here?}
<C>__{mrs. jankis}
<D>__{mr. shelby, try and understand. when i look into sammy's eyes, i don't see some vegetable, i see the same old sammy. what do you think it's like for me to suspect that he's imagining this whole problem? that if i could just say the right thing he'd snap out of it and be back to normal? if i knew that my old sammy was truly gone, then i could say goodbye and start loving this new sammy. as long as i have doubt, i can't say goodbye and move on.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{mrs. jankis, what do you want from me?}
<C>__{mrs. jankis}
<D>__{i want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that sammy is faking his condition.}
<A>__{leonard plays with his letter opener, thinking.}
<C>__{mrs. jankis }
<D>__{i need to know what you honestly believe.}
<C>__{leonard}
<P>__{(looks at mrs. jankis)}
<D>__{i believe that sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.}
<C>__{mrs. jankis}
<D>__{thank you.}
