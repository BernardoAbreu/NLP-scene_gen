<A>__{hellboy lurches into the passageway and spots myers. painfully drags himself over. liz's body is on the floor. manning limps in from an adjacent room. hellboy cradles liz's head in his huge hand. holds her against his powerful chest and whispers in her ear. a beat or two, then a moan.}

<D>__{in the dark i heard your voice what did you say ?}
<A>__{he looks at her, lovingly caressing her hair.}
<C>__{hellboy}
<D>__{"you, on the other side: let her go. because for her, for her i will die. i will cross over."}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{"and you'll be sorry i did."}
<A>__{myers smiles. liz looks at hellboy for the first time as what he is: the man she loves. a warm, gentle fire rims her body. manning watches. agent myers smiles a sad smile, illuminated by the flames. hellboy and liz kiss. the fire haloes them and builds as tom waits' cinny's waltz fills the air.}
