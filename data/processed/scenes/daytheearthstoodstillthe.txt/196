<A>__{gort is still working over the body of klaatu. from a socket in the wall he pulls a strange looking hypodermic needle on the end of a cord or tube and gives klaatu a shot in the arm. close shot helen as she watches, fascinated in spite of her terror.}
<B>__{full shot}
<A>__{gort fiddles with the dials again and there are electrical cracklings and sputterings. suddenly he flips a switch and all sound ceases. gort removes the electrodes and watches klaatu. camera moves in on klaatu and we see him start to breathe. in a moment his eyelids flutter. then his eyes open and he looks around.}
<B>__{med. close shot}
<A>__{as klaatu slowly lifts himself to a sitting position. helen watches breathlessly as he glances around the room, as though to orient himself. then he lowers his feet to the floor and stands up. he blinks uncertainly, then smiles at them.}

<P>__{(indicating the equipment gort used)}
<D>__{this technique, in certain cases, can re stimulate life for a limited period. it's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people.}
