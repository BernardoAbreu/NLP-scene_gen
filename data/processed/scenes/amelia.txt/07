<T>__{dissolve to her memory of:}
<L>__{exterior field, des moines day}
<A>__{two little girls, maybe 10 years old, walking in a field. amelia and a girlfriend. they stop, hearing... the droning of an engine, a small red plane appearing above the treetops. the pilot seeing two girls alone in the field, swoops down to buzz them. amelia's friend runs for her life. but amelia stands still, throws her arms wide, and the plane... ...drops lower, and lower, as it closes straight in on the slender girl with her outstretched arms. louder and faster, as if intent on winning some impulsive duel of wills. the aircraft screams past, just above her head.}
<C>__{amelia }
<D>__{as the little red airplane passed by, it said something to me.}
<A>__{amelia beams. she fills her lungs, transported.}
<D>__{amelia (v.o.) (contâ€™d) i don't think i've ever stopped listening.}
<A>__{hold on her, hair and uniform whipping in the breeze.}
