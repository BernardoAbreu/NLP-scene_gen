<A>__{as he stumbles around the side of the jeep directly into the blaze of the headlights. there are scars, new and healing on maggio's face. one of his ears is cauliflowered, enough to give him the lopsided ribald look of a punchy. a couple of teeth are missing. weirdly outlined in the glare, he is a nightmare figure, an apparition. the whine in the distance is identifiable now. it is the siren of the stockade.}
