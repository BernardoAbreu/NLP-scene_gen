<L>__{interior phil parsons' office day}
<A>__{parsons leafs through miranda's file. pete stands by the window, lost in thought.}
<C>__{parsons}
<D>__{how much does she remember?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{it all came flooding back last night.}
<C>__{parsons}
<D>__{guilt?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{more like an uncontrollable reminiscence. intense, over cathected. she's not feeling guilty of her actions, not exactly. sounds to me like last night she actually re lived them in great detail.}
<C>__{parsons}
<D>__{hypermnesis following amnesia. could a specific epileptic element be involved?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{that's exactly what she suggested. even in her present state, her instincts remain impeccable.}
<C>__{parsons}
<D>__{i'd like to talk to her.}
