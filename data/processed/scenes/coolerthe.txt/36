<A>__{a "now performing" poster on a metal stand: johnny cappella live at the paradise lounge! panning off the sign and following a couple through the doors into the theater. ...our eye drawn to the stage. a troupe of gorgeous female dancers in leopard print g strings, grinding their hips to the muscular rhythm. flanking them are a pair of strutting lions in elevated cages. an explosion of light and smoke... and johnny cappella makes his entrance. decked out in a reflective suit that picks up every light in the house and throws it back at the audience. johnny's got the style of a harry connick jr. and the moves of ricki martin. the energy this guy brings to the stage makes the last twenty years of buddy stafford's reign seem like suspended animation. the women in the audience start fanning themselves with delight. it's a new dawn in paradise. and the panties are coming fast and furious. we see shelly watching from the back of the room. he shifts his attention to nicky, larry and marty at a primo table. they're having a grand time. nicky pats larry on the back of the head. "good work, kid." larry turns and raises his drink to shelly. shelly stares right through him. a declaration of war.}
