<A>__{we see a couple of very contemporary looking 15 year olds going into a very "now" clothing store like fred segal's... when the door opens, loud rock 'n roll music blasts out.}
<L>__{interior the jean machine day}
<A>__{inside the store we see all the sales clerks grooving narcissistically to the music like they're at a disco. the cashier, phoebe, has devoted her life to following the current trends and fads no matter how inane they may be. today she's in a reggae mode, her hair wound into tight dreadlocks, as she sways lost in the ozone to the music. a customer approaches her with a purchase.}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{i'd like to pay for these.}
<C>__{phoebe}
<D>__{huh... what... oh sure, wait till this song is over.}
<A>__{she floats off again... one of the young male customers approaches an attractive salesgirl. this is debbie thomerson, rick's intended. she seems to be the only sane employee in the place because she's actually working, putting clothes on the racks. this impression of sanity fits her, as she is level headed, and has a clear sense of herself. she can also take a joke, thus her engagement to rick.}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{excuse me, where can i try on these pants?}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{right over here.}
<A>__{she leads the customer to the try on booths. the customer enters one. we see that the saloon style doors of the booths have been hung too high, so as he takes off his pants, his underwear is exposed to the world. we pull back, revealing other people in other booths, their bare asses clearly in sight. no one in the store seems to care, however, as they are much too busy dancing. the front door opens and bobbie, a very sultry and earthy looking girl with long, dark hair, pushes inside. she is o'neill's girl and debbie's best friend... she's also someone who would party every night if given half a chance.}
<C>__{bobbie}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{debbie... i don't believe it. i'm so excited.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{bobbie, what are you talking about?}
<C>__{bobbie}
<D>__{o'neill just tole me. it's sooo great... i don't believe it.}
<A>__{phoebe crosses to them.}
<C>__{phoebe}
<D>__{what's happening?}
<C>__{bobbie}
<D>__{debbie's marrying rick.}
<C>__{phoebe}
<D>__{...really?}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{yes, it's true.}
<C>__{phoebe}
<D>__{ohmygod.}
<A>__{the girls screech and jump around, hugging each other in sheer joy. a male customer, moved by this outpouring of affection, moves over and gets in the middle of the girls, enjoying every moment of being hugged by three women at once.}
<C>__{debbie}
<P>__{(to customer; realizing)}
<D>__{would you get out of here.}
<A>__{reluctantly the guy retreats back to the calvin klein jeans rack.}
<C>__{bobbie}
<D>__{does cole know about this?}
<C>__{phoebe}
<D>__{really you went with him for two years.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{he still thinks i'm going with him. i'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.}
<C>__{bobbie}
<D>__{he's not gonna be happy. and your parents can't be too thrilled either.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{no. as far as they're concerned the only good rick is a dead rick. but i don't care... it's my decision.}
<C>__{phoebe}
<P>__{(oblivious)}
<D>__{i'm totally blown away. you're getting married. it seems like only yesterday i showed you how to have oral sex.}
<C>__{bobbie}
<D>__{deb, i want to throw you a shower.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{oh, that's really sweet. i'd love that.}
<C>__{phoebe}
<D>__{we'll invite all the girls.}
<C>__{bobbie}
<D>__{i don't believe it... mrs. rick stahl.}
<A>__{the girls all start to scream and carry on all over again.}
