<C>__{is predominantly}
<A>__{subterranean. he's being subterranean treated without compassion or respect.... various shots of photographs and documents: "ufo crash," "major nelec in charge of operations," "two alien bodies, one living," "restraints used," "experiments conducted" as charles threads a film: the film: an air force logo pops on and off. we see inside a hangar, where dozens of scientists examine large, bus sized pieces of jagged and unearthly material. all the while:}
<C>__{dr. woodward }
<D>__{ i explained that all he wants is to rebuild his ship. dr. woodward (v.o.) (cont'd) a craft made up of those cubes of a complex, shape shifting element remarkable material that we'll never fully understand. he has been desperate to reconstitute his ship since it crashed here in `58, but instead of giving him the help he needs, we've held him as a prisoner. he's been restrained and experimented upon through pain and lack of compassion, we have taught him to hate us all. we've turned him into an enemy.}
<A>__{scientist explaining something to a group of senior officers. among them, a 32 year old nelec. film jump cuts to a huge reinforced lab cage. inside, sitting almost in a ball, is the massive creature. hard to see here. another jump cut : as a soldier offers a bucket of food to the alien it's woodward.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{guys, it's dr. woodward. look.}

<A>__{arh! i can't watch that!}
<C>__{dr. woodward }
<D>__{i told them i knew these things because he made contact with me. that he makes a psychic connection by touch. the moment we made contact, i understood him and he, me. what i know is that if we don't change this and start helping him, we will all pay the price. but nelec won't listen }
