<A>__{the last of the wedding guests is leaving: ed nesby carrying his bull fiddle and with his wife and daughter and two smaller children preceding him out the door. the jorgensens stand by trying to put a good face on the wedding debacle. charlie maccorry is sitting dejectedly, studying a spot on the floor. ethan is at the mantel. laurie is in her room presumably changing out of her wedding gown. martin is at a sink, bathing a cut on his lip. clayton, still in his clerical coat, is near the door.}
