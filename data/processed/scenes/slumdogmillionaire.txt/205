<A>__{vt station is awash with the evening commute. thousands of people crowd the platforms, jostling the only still figure who is sitting at the base of the statue of frederick stevens. jamal. then there is a gap in the wall of bodies that swirls around him. jamal gets to his feet.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{latika?}
<A>__{then she is gone in the melee again. only to reappear.}
<C>__{latika}
<D>__{jamal?}
<A>__{jamal forces himself through the people. nothing will stop him. latika too is shoving them aside until they are face to face. they stop, look at each other, hold each other's hands tight. the whole station seems frozen, the only movement from a thousand bodies being jamal and latika.}
<C>__{latika }
<D>__{i thought we would meet again only in death.}
<A>__{he shakes his head.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{i knew you'd be watching.}
<A>__{jamal puts his hand on latika's chin, turns her head gently so that she is facing him. he sees the knife scars on her cheek for the first time. she tries to turn her head, but he won't let her. runs his hand slowly down the scar. rests his hand there.}
<C>__{jamal }
<D>__{this is our destiny.}
<A>__{he gently kisses the scarred cheek.}
<C>__{jamal }
<D>__{this is our destiny.}
<A>__{the camera pulls back and back, rising above the station. the music starts and the frozen station comes alive, two thousand kurta clad men and saree clad women dancing in and out and on top of the trains, an unbound celebration of hope and humanity that has at its centre, jamal and latika.}
