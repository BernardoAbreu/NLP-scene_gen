<L>__{interior the fruit cellar}
<A>__{lila goes to the chair, touches it. the touch disturbs the figure. it starts to turn, slowly, stiffly, a clock wise movement. lila looks at it in horror. it is the body of a woman long dead. the skin is dry and pulled away from the mouth and the teeth are revealed as in the skeleton's smile. the eyes are gone from their sockets, the bridge of the nose has collapsed, the hair is dry and wild, the cheeks are sunken, the leathery brown skin is powdered and rouged and flaky. the body is dressed in a high neck, clean, well pressed dress, obviously recently laundered and hand ironed. the movement of this stuffed, ill preserved cadaver, turning as if in response to lila's call and touch, is actually graceful, ballet like, and the effect is terrible and obscene. lila gazes for one flicker of a deathly moment, then begins to scream, a high, piercing, dreadful scream. and lila's scream is joined by another scream, a more dreadful, horrifying scream which comes from the door behind her.}

<A>__{lila turns.}
<B>__{norman}
<A>__{his face is contorted. he wears a wild wig, a mockery of a woman's hair. he is dressed in a high neck dress which is similar to that worn by the corpse of his mother. his hand is raised high, poised to strike at lila. there is a long breadknife in it.}
<B>__{lila}
<A>__{close on her face. she is dumb struck. her eyes are screaming.}
<B>__{back to norman}
<A>__{as he is about to start forward, a man's hand reaches in from the doorway behind, grabs norman's wrist. sam comes through the door, still holding tight to the wrist, pulling back the arm and at the same time throwing himself at norman, football tackle style. series of cuts the fight norman and sam, struggling. the wild fury in norman's face, the mad noise of his screams and vile curses. the terrified, fight to the death look of sam. the still, staring lila.}
<B>__{mrs. bates}
<A>__{a close of her face, she appears to be watching and enjoying the fight. over the shot, the sounds of the struggle, the screams of norman.}
