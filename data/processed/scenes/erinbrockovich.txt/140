<A>__{his office is all about hinkley. a map of the plume area and a diagram of the plant cover one wall; photos of the plant cover the credenza; piles of documents litter every surface; erin is up at the map, eating chinese food.}

<D>__{they used the hex chrom here, in these cooling tanks, as an anti corrosive. then they dumped it here, in these six ponds.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{i don't remember seeing any ponds up there.}
<A>__{she bites into a forkful of food, keeps talking.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{they covered 'em over. and not too carefully either, cause you dig one inch under the surface, and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{and that's what caused the contamination?}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{it didn't help, but no. the real problem's on the bottom.}
<A>__{she reaches for a document, reads from it.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{see, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground. but guess what }
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{they skipped that step.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{i guess it was a little too inconvenient. so for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.}

<D>__{jesus.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i don't even wanna ask what you did to make this melendez guy talk.}
<A>__{in response to the insinuation, erin gives him a glare.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{for your information, frank cares what was in those ponds 'cause he used to spend half his day wading around them. that was his job.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{no shit.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{no }
<A>__{suddenly, her eyes pop out of her head }
<D>__{erinshit! shit! hot! hot! hot!}
<A>__{tears spring to her eyes. she fans furiously at her mouth. ed finds the tequila from the client and hands it to her. she takes a swig. there's a nanosecond of relief ... until the tequila hits. her eyes redden. she spews and gasps.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{you ...asshole...}
<A>__{ed chuckles.}
