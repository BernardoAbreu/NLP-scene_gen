<L>__{exterior grandpa reaches trailer}
<A>__{in a blizzard of rain, jimmy looks twice in a cowboy shirt, jeans and boots, leaps off the top of the airstream, clutching his medicine bundle. floodlights hit him from all directions. bullhorns screaming at him. he tries to turn a corner and runs right into a fed. ray, having run out the back door has slammed right into him. he has his rifle on him, and they stare each other down for a split second before he is converged on. guns at his back, at his head. he is swept off his feet, face down, and frisked. he looks up at ray, desperately.}
<C>__{looks twice}
<D>__{brother, the old man told me about you. listen to me: what was leo trying to tell me? he wanted to meet me at maisy }
<A>__{another fed, pushes his face into the mud, cuffs him behind his back.}
<C>__{fed}
<D>__{save your speeches for prison, jimmy.}
<A>__{with two five man swat teams swarming the area, and six agents pushing jimmy toward a car, cooch stands there in the pouring rain, looking relieved. ray stands near him, looking abhorred.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{damn. that's one hard running indian.}
<A>__{ray watches jimmy as he is shoved into the back of miles and sherman's car and driven away. he is twisting around in his seat to look at ray. desperately. the swat teams disband, return to their vehicles.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{it's over, ray. i aged five years. but it's over. at least i'm gonna look like i'm ready for the advisory desk. let's go get a beer.}
<A>__{cooch heads to his car and ray starts shuffling toward his as if he is dared by it all. he is looking at the trailer and there on the rickety porch is grandpa. he comes down the steps slowly, holding his hat on against the wind. he watches the cars pulling out. ray walks over to him, looking sick.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{look... i'm not who you think i am.}
<P>__{(a long beat)}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{and after a moment of locking gazes, he starts for his car,}
<C>__{grandpa}
<D>__{out back that way... is a placed called wounded knee.}
<A>__{ray turns.}
<C>__{grandpa}
<D>__{i was one years old there when our people were shot down. my mother hid me in the snow in a blanket. one of those killed was a holy man called wakiyan cante thunder heart. they killed him while he was running for the stronghold. it is his blood the same blood that spilled on the grass and snow at wounded knee that runs through your heart like a buffalo.}
<A>__{ray frowns, disturbed by this story. the old man is speaking with conviction. with power.}
<C>__{grandpa}
<D>__{thunder heart has come. sent here to a troubled place to help his people. that's what i am told. maybe you're right and i am mistaken. your mind is young, mine is old. if so, so be it. ho hecetu yelo. i will speak no more.}
<A>__{ray stands, almost paralyzed, digesting this. he turns and looks into the old man's sharp eyes. grandpa has closed his eyes, and as he is pulverized by the rain, he turns his face toward it and from way down in his belly, he begins to sing in lakota. and it is too much. too weird. he wheels and hurries to the car. gets in, and beats a fast path out of the old man's lonesome patch of land. blue heat lightning knifes the sky. thunder rolls, and rumbles into pool balls }
