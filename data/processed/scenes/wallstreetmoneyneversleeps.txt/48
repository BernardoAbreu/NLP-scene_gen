<L>__{interior whole foods day}
<A>__{gordon and jacob share a little table out front of the market. gordon enjoys a turkey burger from the deli while jacob doesn't eat.}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{did you eat before?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{just not hungry.}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{yeah... i used to not eat lunch too.}
<A>__{jacob nods and slides something across the table. the picture of winnie in workout gear, flipping the finger. gordon looks at it and laughs.}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{fitting.}
<A>__{as he places it in his pocket...}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{that'll make it a round trade for us.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i actually owe you one now.}
<A>__{off gordon's look...}
<C>__{jacob }
<D>__{i crushed him.}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{did you?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{his fund is bleeding. i wouldn't be surprised if the redemptions finish the job.}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{well, chief... you seem awfully proud of yourself.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{how'd you know about amlyn?}
<A>__{gordon shrugs.}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{it's amazing what information you can find out when people know you're not going to trade on it.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{so, you didn't use me to make a little money?}
<A>__{and never to look up from his lunch...}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{naw. i prefer to write about the action now than be apart of it.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{why'd you give it to me?}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{you're out of a job and most likely going to marry my daughter... i figured you could use the money.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i didn't make any money off of it.}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{you didn't trade it?}
<A>__{with a smile in and over the top faux innocence.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{that would've been insider trading, mr. gekko.}
<A>__{gordon just shakes his head.}
<C>__{jacob }
<D>__{and not "most likely."}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{winnie and i are engaged.}
<A>__{as gordon finally looks up from his burger... impressed.}
