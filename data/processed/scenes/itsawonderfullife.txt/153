<A>__{potter is seated at his desk, his goon beside him. he is signing some papers. george is seated in a chair before the desk, without a hat or coat, covered lightly with snow.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i'm in trouble, mr. potter. i need help. through some sort of an accident my company's short in their accounts. the bank examiner's up there today. i've got to raise eight thousand dollars immediately.}
<C>__{potter}
<P>__{(casually)}
<D>__{oh, so that's what the reporters wanted to talk to you about?}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{the reporters?}
<C>__{potter}
<D>__{yes. they called me up from your building and loan. oh, there's a man over there from the d.a.'s office, too. he's looking for you.}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(desperate)}
<D>__{please help me, mr. potter. help me, won't you please? can't you see what it means to my family? i will pay you any sort of a bonus on the loan... any interest. if you still want the building and loan, why i...}
<C>__{potter}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{george, could it possibly be there's a slight discrepancy in the books?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{no, sir. there's nothing wrong with the books. i've just misplaced eight thousand dollars. i can't find it anywhere.}
<C>__{potter}
<P>__{(looking up)}
<D>__{you misplaced eight thousand dollars?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{potter}
<D>__{have you notified the police?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{no, sir. i didn't want the publicity. harry's homecoming tomorrow...}
<C>__{potter}
<P>__{(snorts)}
<D>__{they're going to believe that one. what've you been doing, george? playing the market with the company's money?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{no, sir. no, sir. i haven't.}
<C>__{potter}
<D>__{what is it a woman, then? you know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to violet bick.}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{potter}
<D>__{not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? why don't you go to sam wainwright and ask him for the money?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i can't get hold of him. he's in europe.}
<C>__{potter}
<D>__{well, what about all your other friends?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{they don't have that kind of money, mr. potter. you know that. you're the only one in town that can help me.}
<C>__{potter}
<D>__{i see. i've suddenly become quite important. what kind of security would i have, george? have you got any stocks?}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<C>__{potter}
<D>__{bonds? real estate? collateral of any kind?}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(pulls out policy)}
<D>__{i have some life insurance, a fifteen thousand dollar policy.}
<C>__{potter}
<D>__{yes... how much is your equity in it?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{five hundred dollars.}
<C>__{potter}
<P>__{(sarcastically)}
<D>__{look at you. you used to be so cocky! you were going to go out and conquer the world! you once called me a warped, frustrated old man. what are you but a warped, frustrated young man? a miserable little clerk crawling in here on your hands and knees and begging for help. no securities no stocks no bonds nothing but a miserable little five hundred dollar equity in a life insurance policy. you're worth more dead than alive. why don't you go to the riff raff you love so much and ask them to let you have eight thousand dollar? you know why? because they'd run you out of town on a rail... but i will tell you what i'm going to do for you, george. since the state examiner is still here, as a stockholder of the building and loan, i'm going to swear out a warrant for your arrest. misappropriation of funds manipulation malfeasance...}
<A>__{george turns and starts out of the office as potter picks up the phone and dials.}
<C>__{potter}
<D>__{all right, george, go ahead. you can't hide in a little town like this.}
<A>__{george is out of the door by now. camera moves closer to potter.}
<C>__{potter}
<P>__{(on phone)}
<D>__{bill? this is potter.}
