<L>__{interior chemistry lab minutes later}
<A>__{the class, in safety goggles and gloves, has partnered up.}
<B>__{angle on sara and patrick}
<A>__{he's holding two vials. sara picks up a beaker. stares at the blackboard. she has no idea and no intention of admitting it.}
<C>__{patrick}
<P>__{(very casually)}
<D>__{that's too big.}
<A>__{she glints at him, grits through her teeth.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i know it's too big.}
<A>__{she puts the beaker down. picks up a vial. flips through her textbook. her eyes shift from it to the blackboard, trying to make a connection. she settles on one. picks up a vial of powder. patrick grabs her hand, leans over and whispers.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{i wouldn't do that if i were you.}
<C>__{sara}
<P>__{(yanks her hand back)}
<D>__{who died and made you teacher?}
<A>__{patrick pulls back, looks at her. he can't believe she dissed him. a small smile forms on his face. sara turns away from it, goes back to her vials. patrick slides to the farthest end of the table. watches her consternation with bemusement.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{know the difference between ethyl glycol and methyl acetate? both got three elements, two parts the same. it's that first part, c2 versus c3. c3 could blow a vial right out a person's hand.}
<A>__{sara thinks he's messing with her. but then the contents of the beaker begin to ominously bubble. panicked, she drops the vial into their sink. it instantly goes up in smoke. some of the liquid splashes on sara's lab coat. patrick grabs a wet towel, quickly wipes it off. the class stops cold. hill rushes up to them. once he's sure sara's fine, he looks sternly at patrick.}
<C>__{mr. hill}
<D>__{what happened? everybody back in your seats!}
<A>__{patrick stares at sara. her face is red. she's biting her lip.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{i misread the component.}
<C>__{mr. hill}
<P>__{(even more angry now)}
<D>__{you? you misread a component. don't give me that, patrick. you were screwin' around!}
<A>__{hill's tone is searing. he turns to sara. she's trying to say something but the words won't come out. hill regards her wearily, then walks off pushing the curious class back to their stations. sara looks at patrick, weakly mouths "thanks."}
