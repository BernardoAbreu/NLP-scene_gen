<L>__{exterior pier night}
<A>__{a small freighter is tied up to a half crumbling pier. next to the pier is a dilapidated corrugated metal warehouse building, two stories high. there are floodlights on the dock but beyond is black night, with the ghostly shapes of mangroves and palms. it is an abandoned facility on what appears to be a tiny island in the caribbean. there is a lot of activity. three u rent trucks are parked by the warehouse, as well as some other vehicles. about thirty men, clearly crimson jihad terrorists are busy at various activities. many of them carry ak47 assault rifles. malik is supervizing them as they finish unloading a tarp covered object about 15 feet high from the ship. a rusting gantry crane trundles it into the warehouse. malik looks up as an aerospatiale helicopter thunders toward them over the black caribbean water. the helicopter lands and juno steps down from the front door. the sliding door is opened and akbar and the others pull a groggy harry and helen out of the aircraft. they are covered by hoods. malik walks up to them and pulls their hoods off. harry takes in his surroundings and looks back into the eyes of malik. lethal energy flows between them.}
