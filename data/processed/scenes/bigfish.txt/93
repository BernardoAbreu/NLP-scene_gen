<D>__{no, wait!}
<A>__{edward moves just as mr. soggybottom fires. the bullet catches edward in the shoulder, knocking him down. the carnies gasp. licking its chops, the dog approaches the helpless edward, who feels the ground around him, looking for some kind of weapon. he finds only a small stick. he waves it at the dog, ready to strike it. like magic, the dog's whole demeanor changes. it bounces excitedly, ready to play fetch. seeing an opportunity, edward throws the stick as far as he can. the dog bounds after it,}
