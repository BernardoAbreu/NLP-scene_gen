<A>__{moving through the doors of the master suite where a light breeze blows through balcony of sheer curtains, lowrey turns ever so slowly with his flashlight following a beat behind. the beam comes to rest on a bludgeoned body laying on the bed amongst huge pillows and exotic stuffed animals. the telephone cord is wrapped around her neck. lowrey's closer inspection reveals lois's client book where an obvious page and photo have been ripped out. julie's. lowrey goes for the phone. picks it up with his handkerchief. no dial tone. so he drops the receiver and heads out of the room. but just as he reaches the doorway suddenly lowrey's beeper sounds. he jumps. reaches down to switch it off when from out of those billowing curtains noah! sledgehammer in hand, he swings at lowrey, who instinc tively blocks and ducks as the hammer misses and crushes the bannister railing. it gives under lowrey's weight, who reaches over and traps the sledgehammer, only to find one of noah's hammy fists battering him behind the ear until the rail finally gives way. lowrey falls and crashes onto a craftsman table covered in antique picture frames. it collapses underneath him. then close on lowrey's radio laying next to him. it squawks loudly...}
