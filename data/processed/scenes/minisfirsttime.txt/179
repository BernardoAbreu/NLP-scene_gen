<L>__{exterior a dusty two lane road in the central valley day}
<A>__{the sun is blistering hot as mini drives martin's mercedes convertible with the top down.}
<C>__{mini }
<D>__{martin's assets were put in a trust for me and since i was eighteen, i was allowed to live by myself.}
<A>__{she turns down another road at a sign reading "lompoc state prison, 5 miles".}
<L>__{interior a visiting room at lompoc day}
<A>__{mini and martin sit facing each other behind a plexiglas barrier. there are dividers between each phone to provide the prisoners with a little privacy.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{i'm sorry i forgot to bring that book you wanted.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{it's okay, myou can mail it.}
<C>__{ini}
<D>__{are you okay? you look like you haven't showered in days.}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(disturbed)}
<D>__{well...uh...you have to be careful about sh ...so how's school?}
<C>__{mini}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{you'll never guess what happened.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{i was voted valedictorian!}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{but don't you have to be }
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{the best student? i know! but the students took a vote and they said they wanted me to have it for demonstrating remarkable courage in the face of unspeakable loss.}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(smiling sadly)}
<D>__{i wonder how the real valedictorian feels?}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{like slitting his wrists with the sharp end of a protractor.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{is rudell out of his coma yet?}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{i don't know, why?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{why?}
<P>__{(taken aback)}
<D>__{mini, if he recovers, he may try to blackmail you with those pictures.}
<C>__{mini}
<P>__{(nonchalant)}
<D>__{oh...i wouldn't worry about that.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{but if the d.a. got those pictures, you could }
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{i'm pretty sure he won't be doing anything with them.}
<A>__{he looks suddenly very worried.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{mini, you're not thinking of sleeping with him to keep him quiet? because i've met people in here who could help us with him, if it comes to that.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{help us?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{they know people on the outside we could...pay to make sure he doesn't try to take advantage of you.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{oh, gosh, that's so romantic. it's like you're a real life criminal with connections and everything, but i'm a little surprised you haven't figured it out yet.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{mini's eyes glint ever so slightly, as she examines martin's face, almost as if he's an animal at the zoo.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{oh...wow, like i thought you were just playing along `cause i'm your only link to the outside world, but you really don't know?}
<A>__{martin furrows his brow, confused.}
<C>__{m}
<C>__{ini}
<D>__{rudell didn't send those pictures.}
<A>__{he suddenly becomes very still, as mini's lips curl in a thin smile.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{you remember, aurelio?}
<A>__{martin looks at her blankly.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{our cabana boy from mexico?}
<A>__{suddenly, it hits him. he looks almost nauseous.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{what a sweetie, i thought i might have to fuck him, but just giving him the camera was enough.}
<A>__{his knuckles tighten around the phone.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{you...you...}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{it was pretty clear garson wasn't gonna give up, and sooner or later he'd find enough to charge us. it just seemed ridiculous that we'd both end up suffering.}
<A>__{martins jaw tightens as his pupils go black.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{oh, come on, you would've done it if you thought of it first...you know i'm right.}
<A>__{the veins start to bulge in his arm holding the phone.}
<C>__{mini}
<P>__{(suddenly switching gears)}
<D>__{hey, listen, since conjugal visits are pretty much out of the question, i thought it would be cool if we tried a little prison phone sex.}
<A>__{martin stares at her, taking deep steady breaths.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{they don't tap these lines, do they?}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{i think i might even be able to open my blouse without anyone seeing...you ready?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{guard!}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{no? are you sure? i won't be able to come back for a few weeks.}
<P>__{(mock jealous)}
<D>__{wait, have you met someone in here?!}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{guard!}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{why, you old dog! i knew you wouldn't be single in here for long.}
<A>__{a prison guard appears behind martin's stall.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{guard! she did it! she just admitted it! it was her idea!}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{i guess this means i could start dating around too?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{don't let her leave! she's guilty! get the warden!}
<C>__{g}
<C>__{uard}
<D>__{okay, that's enough!}
<A>__{the guard moves to take the phone from him. martin clutches it to his head.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{you bitch! you little whore!}
<C>__{mini}
<P>__{(starting to cry)}
<D>__{daddy, why are you saying those things!}
<A>__{the guard struggles to rip the phone away, but martin holds on for dear life.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i'm gonna kill you! do you hear me, you little bitch!}
<C>__{mini}
<P>__{(sobbing)}
<D>__{daddy, stop! i love you! don't say that! i love you!}
<A>__{finally, the guard smashes martin with a billy club, sending him sprawling on the floor. martin screams behind the glass, but cannot be heard, as the guard hog ties him and drags him away by his feet.}
