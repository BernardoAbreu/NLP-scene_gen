<L>__{interior cloud city large cell}
<A>__{chewbacca is in a cloud city prison cell. the stark room is flooded with hot light. to add to chewie's misery, a high pitched whistle screeches loudly. chewie is going mad. he hits the wall with giant fists as he paces back and forth across the cell floor. the upper lights go off abruptly. the prisoner rubs his eyes and moves to a wall, where he listens for a moment. then, moaning to himself, he moves to a platform where the disassembled pieces of threepio lie. he picks up the golden droid's head and meditates on it for a moment, barking a few philosophical remarks. chewie sticks the robot's head on its torso and starts adjusting wires and circuits. suddenly, the lights in threepio's eyes spark to life as chewie touches two connectors together. threepio immediately begins to speak, but his voice is so slow and so low as to be nearly unintelligible.}

<D>__{mmmm. oh, my. uh, i, uh take this off! i, uh, don't mean to intrude here. i, don't, no, no, no... please don't get up. no!}
<A>__{chewie looks at threepio in bewilderment, then scratches his furry head. he gets an idea and adjusts some connections, whereupon threepio immediately begins speaking normally.}
