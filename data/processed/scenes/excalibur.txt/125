<L>__{interior chapel, camelot night.}
<A>__{a bolt of lightening strikes the chalice, rocking the chapel, and arthur is knocked back violently. rain lashes in through the shattered window upon the terrified knights. they and the priest back away. arthur is left alone. he rises and goes to the chalice, which is bent and cracked. he kneels before it. steam hisses up as rain falls on it.}
<L>__{interior hall of the round table day}
<A>__{sun streams in. many of the knights are in attendance, in full armor. ladies and pages watch from dark corners. arthur addresses the fellowship. he holds the cracked chalice in his hands. he burns with a new found fervor.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{who will ride the labyrinths of the forest, to the very root of his soul, to the very ends of the earth, to find the secret that will redeem us from the evil that has fallen upon us, and make this chalice, and ourselves, whole again?}
<A>__{gawain rises and draws his sword in salute.}
<C>__{sir gawain}
<D>__{i will ride forth in the name of that quest, and commit my strength and my soul to it.}
<A>__{perceval, kay and a few others draw their swords and touch their lips to the blades in oath. sunbeams splash off their armor.}
<C>__{perceval}
<D>__{i will go.}
<A>__{the rest of the fellowship draw their swords in imitation, but the resolution within them is not strong. arthur comes forward to gawain.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{gawain, a dreadful fear is upon me, that we may never meet again, that the fellowship will be no more...}
<A>__{he embraces gawain, tears in his eyes. he turns to perceval, and perceval kneels.}
<C>__{perceval}
<D>__{we will find the secret or die.}
<A>__{arthur kisses the young knight's brow. then he turns to kay.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{kay, i know your heart yearns to go, but i am prisoner to my duties, and you must be to yours, at my side.}
<A>__{arthur and kay watch the knights file out till the hall is empty, the harsh song of their armor growing distant.}
