<L>__{interior gordon's house (soweto) night}
<A>__{the small dark room is crowded. the one oil lamp on the table at the table sits gordon... his glasses on the end of his nose. emily is sitting by the stove. robert stands beside her chair, watching, listening. the youngsters are sleeping in opposite directions on the iron bed. wellington is sitting beside gordon at the table. there is something wild in his manner. he looks everywhere as if he is scared of being attacked unawares. the black cleaner from john vorster sq. stands near the table. gordon is reading aloud from a handwritten document.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{'on the second day of our detention at john vorster square we were taken to one of the top floors. we were ordered to undress and they started to beat us with fists and sjamboks. this for a long time.'}
<A>__{wellington nods and gets more paranoid. the black cleaner puts an understanding hand on his shoulder.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{'on one day me and jonathan...'}
<A>__{gordon pauses... steadies himself... pushes his glasses up his nose... clears his throat...}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{'... we were asked questions for the whole day and night by capt. stolz and different policemen they never stopped. they tried to force us to say we were the leaders at our school, that we were working for the a.n.c. and got money from overseas. capt. stolz wanted to know the names of the students committee and where he can find toni mtimkulu everytime they asked question, they beat us. it was bad beating.'}
<A>__{wellington nods again. emily closes her eyes to shut out the image.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{'we told them we had done nothing and didn't know about all the things they are asking us; on two occasion they put a wet bag over my head and i couldn't breathe i thought i was going to die. one day i heard jonathan being beaten. he was screaming and crying, and then a noise like tables and chairs being knocked down, and capt. stolz shouting "you bastard, get up, do you hear me?" ngubene, don't pretend here, get up." then the next day i heard he had gone to hospital and i never saw him again.'}
<A>__{there's a long silence. gordon closes his eyes and struggles with his grief. emily sobs, robert looks on in anger. then, finally, gordon offers a pen to wellington, who is about to sign the foot of the state ment, when... ... suddenly there is the sound of a truck approaching. wellington rushes to the front window and peers outside; then panics, fear in his eyes, he runs into a bedroom and jumps through the window. everyone in the room is bewildered. the front door bursts open. emily sits impassively look ing at the five policemen (two whites and three africans). the youngest child startled from his sleep starts to cry. emily goes to the bed and picks the child up and returns to her chair.}
<C>__{lieutenant venter}
<D>__{stay right where you are.}
<A>__{he notices the papers on the table and picks them up. he looks at them and realizes their importance. capt. stolz walks into the room and surveys the room and its occupants. lieutenant venter hands him the papers. he goes through them, nodding to himself as he reads silently. he folds them neatly and puts them into his inside jacket pocket. he walks up to gordon.}
<C>__{stolz}
<P>__{(to gordon)}
<D>__{on your feet! so, you must be gordon ngubene?}
<A>__{gordon doesn't answer. he turns to the cleaner who automatically stands.}
<C>__{stolz}
<D>__{we know each other, don't we?}
<A>__{calmly, he paces round the room looking around, then when he reaches the bed where the 10 years old girl is watch ing terrified, he pulls off the blankets, yanks the girl off the bed by her arm and frantically searches the bed. the child cries. robert the brother goes to his sister and hugs her as he glares at stolz with anger and hatred.}
<C>__{stolz}
<P>__{(turning to venter)}
<D>__{gert, in daardie kammer.}
<P>__{(gert, that room) (turning to the other one)}
<D>__{jaimie, in die ander.}
<P>__{(jamie, the other room)}
<C>__{lieutenant venter}
<D>__{niks, kaptein.}
<P>__{(nothing, captain)}
<C>__{stolz}
<D>__{take the bastards away.}
<A>__{the other policeman appears from the other bedrooms empty handed. gordon and the cleaner are roughly handled as they are handcuffed by the african security police. over his shoulder gordon manages to give emily one last look, as he's hustled out of the house. emily sits motionless, anger in her face. she can hear the sound of the cars driving away. margaret (her neighbor) appears at the door.}
