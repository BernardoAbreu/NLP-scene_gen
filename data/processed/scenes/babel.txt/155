<L>__{interior room, anwar's house afternoon}
<D>__{dusk. susan sleeps and richard looks at the vast desert through the window. anwar, sitting on a chair, with a fan clears away the flies hovering around susan. we can hear the call to prayer and anwar prostrates himself toward mecca. richard observes anwar's prayer and then looks at susan who moans in her sleep.}
