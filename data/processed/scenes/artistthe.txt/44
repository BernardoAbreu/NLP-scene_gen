<D>__{outside he feels a few seconds of discouragement but, as he meets the gaze of the engineers waiting in the secretary's antechamber, he puffs up his chest and walks tall out of the office.}
<L>__{interior kinograph studios stairs day}
<D>__{going down the stairs from the offices, he passes a laughing peppy who is accompanied by two young and charming men, perfect specimens of america's golden youth. she is coming up, he is going down. when she notices him, she stops, already one step above of him. she has a beaming smile and is truly delighted to see him. he is delighted too, although his mood is very different. title card (him): how are you? title card (her): fantastic! i've been given a lead role! isn't it wonderful?! he nods, we see in his eyes that he's terribly happy for her. they look at each other, she laughs. then she fumbles in her bag for something with which to note down her telephone number on a piece of paper. it takes a while and is a little chaotic, she apologizes, but he visibly takes a lot of pleasure out of watching her. she finally gets the number down and hands it to him, telling him to call her to really call her. in response he casts a glance over to the young men waiting for her higher up the stairs, and she bursts out laughing. she leans towards him to say something. title card: gadgets! she looks at him flirtatiously. then she gestures again for him to call her, and he nods, even though we think that he probably will not do so. she leaves and he watches her go before beginning his decent once more. once at the top, she turns back to call out to george, he too has turned to look. she smiles at him, breaks into a few tap steps for old time's sake, then blows him a kiss. he catches the kiss with a smile, pretends to make it disappear in his other hand like a magician, then shows her the inside breast pocket of his jacket as proof that he's keeping it safe and warm. she laughs loudly and goes on her way. he watches her walk away with admiration in his eyes. she vanishes and george's smile takes on a note of melancholy, and then he leaves too.}
