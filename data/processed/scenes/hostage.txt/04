<A>__{a rotted out toyota pickup lurches to a stop alongside the minimart, white boy hip hop booming on the radio which dies with the engine dennis rooney is driving; twenty three years old, working class desert trash with a high opinion of his own brooding good looks. in the middle: kevin rooney, nineteen, scared shitless at what they're about to do. riding shotgun: mars krupchek, twenty four, a large pasty guy with a shaved head and faraway eyes.}
