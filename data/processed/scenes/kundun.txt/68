<A>__{the nechung oracle is the protective deity of tibet. tonight, he is in full trance. it is an amazing sight. the monk who is his medium spins and twirls, he wags his heavy headdress about. a round mirror glitters on his chest. sweat pours from his brow, over his wildly grimacing face. the oracle spits at the government officials in the room. horns blow, cymbals crash, incense burns. the oracle nears the dalai lama and retreats from him. finally, he whispers in the boy's ear.}

<A>__{and then, the oracle gently straightens tenzin gyatso's yellow robes, before the trance ends and the oracle falls into the arms of his attendants.}
