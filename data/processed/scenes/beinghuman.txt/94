<L>__{exterior camp day}
<A>__{civilization has taken hold quickly in this little corner of africa. dom paulo, the leader, already has a table and chair set up in the sand, and behind him sailors are erectig a tent like house, made from timbers and rich tapestries and carpets. the others are making their own shelters all along the beach. a regular little community is taking shape, a crazy, rich textured village decked out in all the colors of the east. the silks and ginghams that were destined for the finest halls in europe now give shelter to sick slaves, starving sailors, ruined traders and grieving mothers. some of the survivors have recovered sufficiently from the trauma of near death to mark out the boundaries of their new beach homes with lines of stones. the habits of ownership die hardest of all. although dom paulo is the man in authority he is also a man in deep shock. most of what he has earned or plundered in his colonial years now lies at the bottom of the ocean. since he is socially superior to anyone else on the ship he assumes responsibility and command. there are probably fifty men among the survivors more suited to lead them to safety. by dom paulo's side always is his son. a quiet boy of about eleven. he is like a little miniature of his father, dressed in the same style of clothes. he is a constant, silent witness to everything that dom paulo does, good or bad, wise or foolish. he and his father are a continuing fascination for hector, and we can enjoy hector watching the boy watching his father. some of the absurdities and comedies of the situation can be high lighted in this way. there can be sadness in it too however, the pain of a son witnessing his father's compromises or failures all too closely, and dom paulo's sad awareness of his image slowly tarnishing in his son's eyes. amidst the construction work, dom paulo is talking with some of his officers.}
