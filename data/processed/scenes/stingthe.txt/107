<L>__{interior lonnegan's cabin night}
<A>__{lonnegan sits in a chair smoking, obviously still upset. floyd paces in front of him.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{i know i give him four threes. we can't let him get away with that.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{what am i supposed to do? call him for cheating better than me?}
<A>__{there's a knock at the door. floyd goes and opens it. it's hooker.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{my name's carver. mr. shaw sent me.}
<A>__{floyd motions him in without a word.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{your boss is quite a card player, carver. how does he do it?}
<C>__{hooker}
<P>__{(very matter of factly)}
<D>__{he cheats.}
<A>__{lonnegan says nothing. he doesn't like smart asses. he looks hooker over a second, as if considering whether to have him wasted or not.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<P>__{(reaching into his coat pocket)}
<D>__{he'll have to take a check.}
<P>__{(pulling out a check)}
<D>__{i couldn't find my wallet.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{yeh, he knows that.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<P>__{(startled)}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{hooker}
<P>__{(pulling out}
<D>__{lonnegan's wallet and}
<P>__{tossing it to him)}
<D>__{he hired a dame to take it from ya.}
<A>__{lonnegan just holds the wallet. he can't believe it.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{you were set up, lonnegan. shaw's been planning to beat your game for months. he was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<P>__{(the heat rising)}
<D>__{i could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.}
<C>__{hooker}
<P>__{(cool as hell)}
<D>__{so could shaw.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{then why the rat?}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{cause i'm tired of bein' his nigger.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i want you to help me break him.}
<A>__{lonnegan looks at hooker long and hard, as if the intensity of his gaze could separate truth from fiction. lonnegan hadn't expected this, but now that it's here, it better be on the level. the silence is suddenly broken by the noise of the train braking into the station.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<P>__{(to hooker)}
<D>__{c'mon, i will give ya a lift home.}
<A>__{hooker hesitates, not sure whether to accept or not.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{what's the matter? you gotta get back to shaw?}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{naw, he picked up some jane in the bar. can't see him till morning anyway.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{all right, then.}
