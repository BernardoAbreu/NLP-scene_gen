<L>__{interior clinic reception at starliner towers afternoon}
<A>__{the starliner towers medical clinic is small but complete. dr. st. luc and his nurse, forsythe, are backed up by a secretary receptionist who sits behind a desk surrounded by filing cabinets at the end of the hallway which serves as reception area. there are chairs lined up against one wall, flanked by coffee tables piled high with the traditional two year old magazines. three or four people sit waiting to see st. luc, among them the aging but sprightly mr. parkins and janine tudor. parkins, who considers himself something of a ladies' man, is talking to janine when st. luc appears and looks at the list of patients who have signed in.}
