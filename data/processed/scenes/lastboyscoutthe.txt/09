<D>__{west los angeles, california december 20}
<A>__{good morning, mr. and mrs. america, and all the ships at sea. welcome to another lackluster morning in southern california. palm trees limp. windless silence. 80 degrees at 8:00 am. camera cranes down past a huge, rotting billboard. on the billboard, a girl in tight jeans. grabbing her own butt. a surprised look on her face. yes, honey, that's your butt. move in on a tiny, weather beaten bungalow. in the shadow of the 405 freeway. a shingle hangs from a wrought iron post: joseph r. hallenbeck, confidential}
<B>__{investigations.}
<A>__{on the lawn, a late model plymouth. the sprinkers come to life. fling water across the car.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{inside the car, a lone man is asleep, arms akimbo. sprawled across the seat. half empty bottle of seagrams v.o. radio on, playing tinny jazz music. picture the tiredest, meanest, grouchiest son of a bitch self hating loser you can. now give him a two year old suit from c & r clothing. such is the aforementioned hallenbeck.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{three neighborhood kids have gathered around the car. enjoying the spectacle of a sleeping drunk. one tosses a baseball from hand to hand. one picks his nose.}
<D>__{kid #1 dude's trashed. kid #2 shit, we should do something to him.}
<A>__{kid #3 continues mining for nose eggs. it looks like his entire fist is up there. pause, then:}
<D>__{kid #3 i know where there's a dead squirrel.}
<A>__{another angle bundle of paper towels some minutes}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{with a tail sticking out. the youngest kid holds it aloft reverently. looks in the open car window at hallenbeck. still snoozing. dead to the world.}
<D>__{kid #1 do it.}
<A>__{they heave the squirrel into the car and run away. a pause. another pause. the sprinkler goes round. nothing happens.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{hallenbeck snores. the mashed squirrel perches on his chest. a shadow falls across him as }
<B>__{kids}
<A>__{return, scratching their heads. staring in at him.}
<D>__{kid #2 goddamn. dude's trashed. kid #3 take his bottle.}
<A>__{kid #1 smiles nervously. reaches in with infinite patience. trembling hand inches closer and closer and closes on the bottle as, without warning }
<B>__{hallenbeck}
<A>__{sits bolt upright and grabs the kid and stuffs a .38 revolver in the kid's face and cocks it.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{hey, motherfucker.}
<A>__{the kid, of course, shrieks. and the light of sanity dawns in hallenbeck's eyes. he sucks in a deep breath. releases the struggling kid. swears under his breath. watches the boys flee in terror. notices a dead squirrel in his lap. scowls. heaves it out the window. pumps a camel into his mouth. lights it. rescues the bottle of seagrams. thus begins his morning. he opens the car door. the sprinkler douses him. he gets out. stands on the lawn. one of the kids, the toughest one, is standing on the sidewalk.}
<D>__{kid #3 i'm not scared.}
<A>__{hallenbeck scowls.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{you're on my property, kid. kid #3 sidewalk belongs to the government.}
<A>__{hallenbeck stares at him. smiles weakly.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{he leans over and vomits on the lawn. one hand gripping the car fender. the sprinkler goes round and round.}
