<D>__{why are you helping me?}
<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{you're case has been driving me crazy. you see, i pride myself on being thorough. there's too many loose ends with your case.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{thought it was best you were hidden until we understand more about the facts. what do you know about these men in black?}
<A>__{white looks up, pauses as if he didn't understand bumstead, then:}
