<L>__{interior norman's detention room (night)}
<A>__{the walls are white and plain. there is no window. there is no furniture except the straight back chair in which norman sits, in the center of the room. the room has a quality of no whereness, of calm separation from the world. the police guard has placed the blanket on norman's knees. norman, as we come upon him, is lifting the blanket, unfolding it. his face, although without makeup and without the surrounding softness of the wig, has a certain femininity about it, a softness about the mouth and a kind of arch womanliness about the brows. calmly, norman places the blanket about his shoulders, as if it were a cashmere shawl. camera remains in a position so that our view of norman is a full one. when the shawl is in position, and norman is settled, we hear, over shot, the voice of his mother, coming from the calm of his thoughts.}
<C>__{mother's voice }
<D>__{it's sad... when a mother has to speak the words that condemn her own son... but i couldn't allow them to believe that i would commit murder.}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{they'll put him away now... as i should have... years ago. he was always... bad. and in the end, he intended to tell them i killed those girls... and that man. as if i could do anything except just sit and stare... like one of his stuffed birds.}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{well, they know i can't even move a finger. and i won't. i will just sit here and be quiet. just in case they do... suspect me.}
<A>__{a fly buzzes close, and then continues buzzing and flying about norman's face.}
<C>__{mother's voice }
<D>__{they're probably watching me. well, let them. let them see what kind of a person i am.}
<P>__{(a pause, as the fly}
<D>__{lights on norman's}
<P>__{hand)}
<D>__{i'm not going to swat that fly. i hope they are watching. they'll see... they'll see... and they'll know... and they'll say... 'why, she wouldn't even harm a fly...'}
<A>__{norman continues to gaze ahead into nothing.}
