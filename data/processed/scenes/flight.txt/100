<A>__{close on whip's face as he struggles with a thick hangover. he rubs his face and smacks his lips, he's dry as a bone. whip shakes his head as he tries to focus his look through the bedroom window. he looks out to see nicole sitting on a chair enjoying the landscape. whip rubs his head before walking to the kitchen.}
