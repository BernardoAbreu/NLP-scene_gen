<A>__{a lumbering figure, blood streaming from one eye, his .38 drawn and outstretched. it's tony staggering to the edge of the stage, straight towards his attacker.}
<C>__{tony}
<P>__{(bellowing)}
<D>__{frank! frank! over here!}
<B>__{on stage}
<A>__{frank and rachel's heads swivel in unison at the sound, looking towards the far aisle.}
<B>__{portman}
<A>__{against the side wall at the front, portman's eyes desperately scan for the source of the voice. he sees tony, his pistol takes aim. frank's pov for a split second, two running figures f.g. pass and cross leaving a momentary clear line to portman.}
<B>__{on stage}
<A>__{frank fires. once. twice.}
<B>__{portman}
<A>__{frank's bullets hit home. the first slams portman in the chest, knocking him against the wall. the second hits the camera on his shoulder, exploding it around his face.}
<B>__{female academy member}
<A>__{blood spatters her white armani dress and the shirt front of her escort. portman's body slumps forward in her lap, pinning her back in her seat. he's dead. his pistol drops onto a pair of shiny, black leather pumps.}
<B>__{on stage}
<A>__{frank holds his aim steady, reluctant to look away. he half turns to rachel, wincing with the effort. she's unhurt. he has fulfilled his promise to her. rachel throws her arms around frank and hugs him, tears streaming down her cheeks. frank farmer's face. sad and weary. his guard is finally down. nothing more can happen. he slowly lowers the gun, closes his eyes and lets his head fall onto his chest.}
<B>__{angle on spector}
<A>__{in the midst of the commotion of medics, security men, police and ushers, spector bends down and gently retrieves the gold envelope and the card bearing rachel's name. there are splatters of blood on it. he tries to wipe them off with the silk handkerchief from his breast pocket.}
