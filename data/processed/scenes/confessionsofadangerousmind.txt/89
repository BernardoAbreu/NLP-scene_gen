<L>__{interior barris's office, barris productions day}
<A>__{subtitle: barris productions, los angeles, 1967 this is the sixties and the office is crazily appointed. street signs, funny posters, faux tiffany lamps, mobiles, lava lamps, an inflatable sex doll, etc. barris, 36, is behind his desk, feet up and on the phone. he wears a t shirt and jeans and loafers. this is a new barris, confident and successful and hip and relaxed and slovenly. outside in the bullpen area we hear the hustle and bustle, laughing and screaming of a busy but casual office.}
