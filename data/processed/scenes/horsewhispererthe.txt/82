<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior iowa motel later that same morning}
<A>__{annie is returning from her jog, sweating. as she crosses to her motel room, she stops by the window, looking in to see: grace, on the floor, straining to do her exercises. annie fills with compassion for her girl reminded of the struggle she faces everyday.}
<L>__{exterior the badlands day}
<A>__{in the distance, the suburban and horse trailer look like a dot on the horizon, moving across the badlands.}
<L>__{interior the suburban another time, dusk}
<A>__{grace leans against the window in the back, in one of her darker moods. annie switches radio stations, from bible thumping to farm reports. she shuts it off. silence. she sees a road sigh: "little bighorn national monument".}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{grace, look!}
<A>__{grace reads the sign.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{would you like to see that?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i don't care.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{i don't care.}
<A>__{annie's comic mimicking, throws grace off center. annie turns off onto the exit. they drive by a massive casino it's neon sign flickering. they drive up a hill past a cafe, two indians in high crowned cowboy hats standing outside of the cafe. she drives up a hill towards the parking lot of the monument...}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{this'll be nice. we haven't seen any of the sights yet. it's history. when i was thirteen i used to love seeing things like this.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you were never thirteen, mom.}
<A>__{annie laughs, taking it as a joke. grace almost smiles. but, annie drives up to sign only to find a closed sign. the park was closed at six. annie stops the car. she's hit a brick wall once more. silence. finally, grace speaks with her usual sarcasm;}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{great idea. so now what?}
<A>__{beat. annie's patience snaps;}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{how long is this going to go on?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{you know what i mean?}
<P>__{(turns to the back seat)}
<D>__{is this it now? is this the way we're going to be from now on?}
<A>__{ignoring her, grace edges to the passenger side and exits the car. annie gets out of the driver's side and walks around as she speaks:}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{do you want us to turn around and go back home? do you?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{what are you asking me for? you didn't ask me if i wanted to come in the first place now i get to decide? forget it!}
<A>__{she begins to turn away. annie grabs her arm.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{who do you think i'm doing this for? i'm doing this for you!}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{bullshit! it's about you! about you deciding! about you always being right! you always getting everything your way, controlling everybody like we work for you or something!}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i don't believe this!}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you just want to get away from daddy and you're using me to do it!}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{that's not true! whatever problems your father and i are having, have nothing to do with this.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you're amazing! you act like i don't live in that house! don't you think i hear the two of you!? don't you think i can tell what's going on? i'm not five years old, mom!}
<P>__{(annie is stopped)}
<D>__{you want to divorce daddy and daddy doesn't want to.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{did he tell you that?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{he doesn't have to! it's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{that's not true!}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{then why do you want to leave?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{it's... it's not that simple to explain. i know you think it is, but it's not. the truth is, i don't really know what i want to do. i don't have all the answers.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{no, you just act like you do.}
<A>__{annie is choked with fury. she doesn't know whether to scream, cry or strangle grace. she turns away and begins walking quickly, blindly, up past a grove of trees. she comes to a cemetery enclosed by a black railing. at the crest of the hill there's a stone monument "the little bighorn cemetery." in the growing darkness, she sees, scattered on the hillsides below her, white tombstones. a place of sorrow. a cool breeze ruffles her coat and she sticks her hands in her pockets. frustrated, alone, at a complete loss as to what to do, what action to take annie, for the first time in frozen, standing still and with her, comes a rush of emotion. she sits with her back against the monument and begins to weep. for grace, for robert, herself, for the tombstones, for everyone. a flashlight shines on her face. it is a park ranger.}
<C>__{park ranger}
<D>__{you okay, ma'am?}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(wipes face)}
<D>__{yes. fine.}
<C>__{park ranger}
<D>__{that young lady is getting a little worried.}
<A>__{annie realizes she left grace alone as it got darker.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i'm sorry...}
<A>__{annie rises and is escorted back to the suburban by the ranger. she sees: grace is sitting in the front seat now, waiting for her like a little girl lost.}
