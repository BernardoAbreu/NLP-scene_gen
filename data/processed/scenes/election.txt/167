<D>__{hello, students, i'm clark naylor of joslyn's educational resources. it's election day, and how you vote will make a big difference in the activities, events, and perhaps even the policies of your school. over the past few days or weeks, you've heard candidates for the various offices make their speeches and tell you where they stand. you've probably seen their posters. maybe you've even had a chance to speak with them personally.}
<A>__{close ups of students now replace the wider shots of classrooms. photographed as though from a soviet propaganda film, some students look up nobly and attentively, while others watch with dead eyes and open mouth, and still others goof off.}

<D>__{well, today marks the end of campaigning, and now the spotlight turns to you. voting is your privilege and your responsibility. remember, no one needs to know for whom you've voted. that's between you. . . and you.}
