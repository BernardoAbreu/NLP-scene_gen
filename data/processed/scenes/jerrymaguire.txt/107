<A>__{rod tidwell races to catch up to a wobbly, overthrown pass. he snags it out of the air, and moves gracefully downfield. he turns back to shout at the quarterback for the wobbly pass, and slams into a padding post. dennis wilburn, the gm we met earlier, crosses in front of maguire, giving him a look. maguire forges ahead anyway.}
