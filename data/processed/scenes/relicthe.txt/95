<L>__{interior electrical room night}
<A>__{on the central switching box... sparking and shorting as an enormous clawed arm swipes it off the wall!}
<L>__{interior hall of the heavens night}
<A>__{everyone pours out of the exhibit, running for the door leading to the rotunda. people are getting trampled. it's a terrible crush. screams! tables over turned everywhere. food scatters to the floor. d'agosta pushes his way out of the exhibit, crosses to kawakita, who is appalled. above, the chandeliers are flickering.}
<C>__{kawakita}
<D>__{what happened?!}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{there's a dead body in the exhibit! people are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out.}
<A>__{ippolito runs over to join them.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{what the hell is going on?!}
<A>__{above them the lights dim again and come back on.}
<C>__{ippolito}
<D>__{the whole system is shutting down! we have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{what doors?}
<C>__{ippolito}
<D>__{i told you! they seal off all the cells. they were designed to fall automatically in a system failure }
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{you said the system couldn't fail!}
<A>__{at this there's a low rumble from above. d'agosta looks up and sees a large metal door is descending from a slot in the ceiling, and not in an orderly fashion. it's falling fast. below are crowds of people, all pushing to get out! officer bailey, near the door, sees it.}
<C>__{bailey}
<D>__{above you! look out!}
<A>__{his voice is lost in an ocean of screaming. kawakita stands in total horror a moment, then joins bailey and d'agosta. all of them try to restrain people from trying to beat the door. ippolito, on the other hand, elbows his way to the front of the fleeing crowd!}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{ippolito! get back here!}
<C>__{ippolito}
<D>__{like hell!}
<A>__{ignoring d'agosta, ippolito pushes past. he barrels over an old man who stumbles and falls directly beneath the falling door! ippolito jumps over him and is out! the old man looks up at the descending wall of steel and screams! d'agosta runs forward, dives for the old man but he's not in time. kawakita covers his eyes, unable to watch as the lights flicker a third and last time. the room is plunged into darkness. and over the screams we hear the rumble and crash, the horrifying cries of the old man, as the door comes down.}
