<B>__{end montage flynn back in his cell}
<A>__{for a rest period. he is pacing back and forth, and we can see ram seated in the next cell. flynn goes to the bars.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{hey, ram ... what were you ... you know, before?}
<C>__{ram}
<P>__{(nostalgic, brightens)}
<D>__{oh, i was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. it really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really}
<C>__{flynn}
<P>__{(about to get bored)}
<D>__{yeah, yeah that's great.}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{how 'bout yourself?}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{oh, uh...i don't remember too much...}
<C>__{ram}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{sure, a little disorientation. that's normal, when they transport you. it'll come back to you. you're doing real well in training. remarkable, really...}
<A>__{the pounding on flynn's cell begins again.}
<B>__{the bridge of the aircraft carrier}
<A>__{we see flynn being led down the hall on the big screen behind sark's console. sark is staring up at the screen, frowning, nervous, frightened of this new user warrior.}
<C>__{sark}
<P>__{(over his shoulder)}
<D>__{wait a minute...put this guy against one of the other recruits.}
<B>__{a shot from in front of flynn and crom}
<A>__{we see they are entering an open part of the game grid, with two bridges of energy extending across open space to two separate circular platforms, made up of concentric glowing rings. crom marches across one of these, and flynn follows suit on the other. when they each reach the circular platforms, the bridges disappear. we see flynn turn and stare back across the empty space, then turn and face his opponent. above them a third floating disk hovers. he looks over at crom, who's anxious.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{looks like we're in the same boat here }
<C>__{crom}
<P>__{(jumpy)}
<D>__{you think you're gonna wipe me right out, don't you?}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{no, i}
<A>__{a buzzer sounds. the game begins. crom hurls a glowing pellet upwards. it strikes the upper platform, ricochets off, and heads straight for flynn. flynn lunges, but misses. the pellet strikes one of the rings of his platform, and that ring dissolves. flynn's lunge takes him right to the edge of the open space created, and he just catches himself in time to keep from falling over the edge. flynn's pov down down, down between the rings into an infinite pit.}
<B>__{back to flynn}
<A>__{staring down. there's a sound and he looks up.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{another pellet hits the mirror platform and hurtles down at him.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{hey!}
<B>__{flynn}
<A>__{reacting, judging where this one will fall, racing to the farther edge of his platform, leaping over the empty ring on the way, and catching the pellet before it can' hit. he throws it back.}
<B>__{crom}
<A>__{flynn's pellet hits the mirror, flashes down on him. crom strains, but misses. one of his rings disappears. flynn reacting}
<C>__{flynn}
<P>__{(happy he's scored)}
<D>__{okay!}
<A>__{sark's aircraft carrier the bridge high above the game we see sark watching.}
<B>__{flynn}
<A>__{racing for another catch. he makes it and hurls the pellet again. we see that crom's platform is disappearing fast.}
<B>__{the game in progress}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{here's an easy one...}
<A>__{flynn throws again. the pellet hits the mirror platform and heads straight at crom, who misses it. the pellet destroys the ring he was standing on, and crom has to grab frantically at the edge of the next ring to keep from falling.}
<B>__{flynn}
<A>__{he is sent another pellet from above and catches it, holding it ready, waiting for his opponent to get back up on the ring.}
<B>__{sark}
<A>__{his face lit from below by the glow of the game grid... angry}
<B>__{flynn}
<A>__{he puts down his cesta. suddenly a voice rings out from above. flynn looks up. there, appearing in the mirror disk above, is sark's face, furious, huge.}
<C>__{sark}
<D>__{finish the game!}
<B>__{flynn}
<A>__{staring at this apparition. he grits his teeth.}
<C>__{flynn}
<P>__{(shouts up)}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{real world a bus station in a greyhound station waiting area, two kids are playing a video game, which appears to have broken down.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{what's wrong with it?}
<C>__{kid 2}
<D>__{i don't know... on the blink or something... damn.}
<A>__{electronic world flynn, sark, etc. as before}
<C>__{sark}
<D>__{kill him!!!}
<A>__{flynn holds up the pellet... and drops it down into the abyss below. he stares back up at sark's immense image.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{sark's huge reflected image in the mirror platform, towering above flynn.}
<C>__{sark}
<D>__{you'll regret this.}
<A>__{sark's finger pressing a button.}
<B>__{crom}
<A>__{the ring he is holding on to dissolves, and with a scream, he falls... and falls ... and falls...}
<B>__{shot from below flynn}
<A>__{with flynn visible, staring down, and the huge face of sark above him.}
<B>__{sark}
<A>__{on the bridge. his finger wavers over another button, almost presses it... we see him straining, trying to overcome his conditioning. then he snatches his hand away.}
<C>__{sark}
<P>__{(looking up)}
<D>__{no! you said he could die in the games}
<B>__{flynn}
<A>__{staring up. the image on the mirror wavers and dissolves.}
<B>__{sark}
<A>__{he slams his palm down on a panel on the console, and a buzzer}
<B>__{sounds. flynn}
<A>__{as the bridge to his platform reappears, and we see guards starting to run across to him.}
<B>__{ram and tron}
<A>__{the sound of guards' running feet approaching their cells. they look up.}
<B>__{a corridor in the game area}
<A>__{flynn is being escorted down it. a couple of big blue warriors go by and deliberately brush into flynn.}
<C>__{warrior}
<P>__{(turning on flynn, snarling)}
<D>__{outta my way, rookie.}
<A>__{flynn stares at him; then, in one smooth motion, reaches to his back and pulls out his disk.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{out of my way, zero bit.}
<A>__{he moves as if to throw the disk.}
<C>__{warrior}
<P>__{(backing away)}
<D>__{sure, sure ... just kiddin'.}
<A>__{the other warrior grabs this one by the arm and pulls him away as flynn and his guards continue on.}
<B>__{the holding area for the light cycle game}
<A>__{ram and tron are escorted in as flynn is brought in from another corridor. three blue warriors are lined up, waiting.}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{flynn! look, tron, he survived!}
<C>__{flynn}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{tron...?}
<A>__{he leans over to get a better look at tron and gasps in surprise.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{alan!}
<C>__{tron}
<P>__{(frowning)}
<D>__{where did you hear that name?}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{well, isn't it ?}
<C>__{tron}
<D>__{the name of my user, yeah. but how... ?}
<C>__{flynn}
<P>__{(thinking fast)}
<D>__{i, uh... i'm a program from a user that... knows alan...?}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{he was disoriented in transport, tron.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{yeah, but i'm remembering all kinds of stuff. like...my user wants me to go after the mcp}
<A>__{before they can go on, the buzzer sounds.}
