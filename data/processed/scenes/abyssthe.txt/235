<L>__{exterior deepcore the wall}
<A>__{from far below, deepcore is a faint tiara of lights, above in the blackness. a single moving light appears above, at the edge of the cliff, and starts down. it grows large, resolving into bud, free falling down the wall. he gathers speed as little geek's vertical thruster drives them down. bud looks down. between his feet he can see a short way down the wall in the glow of his single light, and beyond that an unfathomable blackness. the wall unrolls upwards out of the darkness like a convoluted gray drapery. he looks up. the lights of deepcore are gone. he feels more alone than he has ever felt. he types out: cant see you}

<A>__{bud comes upon the twisted wreckage of the crane, hanging against the wall like a forty ton yo yo at the end of the umbilical.}
