<L>__{exterior streets day (late afternoon)}
<A>__{roberta, nick and lexi walk allegra in their neighborhood. roberta looks worn out.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{i'm a good teacher. i've worked so hard to give these kids something to be proud of.}
<A>__{lexi moves to comfort her.}
<C>__{lexi}
<D>__{i'm so sorry, mom. i can't believe they did this to you.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{it's like when my father got killed. for twenty years, he followed every safety rule the factory had, and then someone else flips the wrong switch...}
<P>__{(she chokes up)}
<D>__{it's not fair. you do everything right and then...}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{it's the wrong analogy. you couldn't do anything about grandpa's death. it was irreversible. this isn't.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{tell that to the board of education.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{let me ask you something. why did you risk your life for a bicycle?}
<A>__{roberta and lexi look at nick, baffled as to the relevance of the question.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{i did not risk my life.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{of course you did! that building? threatening henry? and for what two hundred dollars?}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{no. not for that.}
<C>__{lexi}
<D>__{then why?}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{when someone steals something that belongs to my kids, i'm not gonna sit back and let that happen!}
<A>__{a beat as she realizes what she's just said. the boys look at her and the three of them stop walking.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{guys you need to think about this. if i try to fight this with no salary coming in i could lose the house, screw up your college plans... it would be a lot safer to just go out tomorrow and get a job in a private school.}
<C>__{lexi}
<D>__{yeah, but is that where you really want to be?}
