<A>__{kelly grits his teeth, barely visible in the whiteness. then it is gone. he hangs his head in exhaustion. magneto himself is a bit overwhelmed. he looks at his own skin no apparent change. he shakes his head, blinks his eyes. sabretooth and pyro are also a bit struck by the display and they also seem a bit dazed. magneto walks over and reaches into the still steaming metal device. his hand comes out holding the dog tag actually its remains. a frazzled, blackened wire, warped and spent. nothing more. and this turns to dust in his fingers. magneto has amazed even himself this time. the silence is shattered by a phone ringing. sabretooth picks it up. he listens, then hands the phone to magneto.}

<D>__{oh... oh god... what have you done to me?}
<A>__{magneto hangs up the phone. he crosses to kelly, leans in and whispers in his ear.}
