<A>__{jill is standing at the wet bar in the corner, pouring herself a drink. she samples the alcohol, doesn't cough, and starts to pour a little more into the glass. the phone rings. jill turns, then slowly walks to the table, kneels down and quietly picks up the phone and brings it to her ear. she waits and listens, a full three seconds. no sound comes to her. she quickly hangs up the phone before the silence can be broken by the voice she knows is waiting on the other end. then, she shuffles through her books and papers on the table top until she finds the notepad the doctor's wife has left for her with the name and phone number of the restaurant. jill picks up the phone and dials. after several rings...}

<D>__{hello, i'd like to speak to dr. mandrakis. this is his babysitter.}
<C>__{maitre d' }

<C>__{maitre d' }
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{maitre d' }
<D>__{dr. mandrakis left the restaurant about forty minutes ago.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{forty minutes?}
<C>__{maitre d' }
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{jill}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{okay. thank you.}
<A>__{she hangs up, thinks for a moment, then picks up the phone again and dials "o"...}
<C>__{operator }
<D>__{operator...}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{hello, operator? can you get me the police?}
<C>__{operator }
<D>__{is this an emergency?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{yes!}
<P>__{(beat)}

<C>__{operator }
<D>__{the number is 555 9431. would you like me to connect you?}
<C>__{jill}

<C>__{man's voice }
<D>__{seventh precinct, sergeant sacker.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{hello, i've been getting phone calls, every fifteen minutes or so. i think it's a man. he's trying to scare me.}
<C>__{sacker }
<D>__{an anonymous caller?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{sacker }
<D>__{has he threatened you?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{sacker }
<D>__{has he been using obscene language?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{no. he just keeps calling me. sometimes he doesn't say anything.}
<C>__{sacker }
<D>__{there's really nothing we can do about it down here. is the phone listed in your name?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{no, i'm just the babysitter.}
<C>__{sacker }
<D>__{it's probably just some weirdo. the city's full of them. believe it or not, we get reports like this every night. it's nothing to worry about.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{oh...}
<C>__{sacker }
<D>__{have you tried whistling?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sacker }
<D>__{if you can find a good loud whistle somewhere in the house, blow it into the phone hard, next time he calls. probably break his eardrum. he won't bother you after that.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{no, i... you're probably right. it's nothing to worry about.}
<C>__{sacker }
<D>__{or you could just take your phone off the hook.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{no, the people i'm babysitting for might try to reach me.}
<C>__{sacker }
<D>__{well, as i say, there's nothing we can really do to help you down here.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{okay. thank you.}
<C>__{sacker }
<D>__{you bet. goodnight.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{goodnight.}
<A>__{jill hangs up. after thinking for a moment, she tries a couple of ways of whistling as loud as she can, but frustrated and feeling foolish, she soon gives up.}
