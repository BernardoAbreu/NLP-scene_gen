<A>__{music: great white "once bitten twice shy" randy is driving along route 21. "once bitten twice shy" is blasting on the stereo. one hand on the wheel, he bangs out the song's piano riff on the dash with the other. he passes cheetah's, a strip club. he keeps an eye on it as he drives past. the song fades out. he pops the tape out of the deck and tosses it on the passenger seat. on it is a messy pile of old cassettes. skid row. motley crue. ac dc. guns `n' roses. he sifts through the selection, one eye on the road.}
