<L>__{exterior commercial area bus stop night}
<A>__{we see enid at norman's bus stop, sitting on the bench. she looks at the apartment building across the street. a woman who has just arrived home from work turns on the tv, bathing her living room with that eerie blue light. the same thing happens in another window down the street... then another... enid looks down the street. in the distance a bus rounds the corner and heads toward her. from a third story window across the street, we see the bus as it arrives and stops, blocking enid from view. a moment later it pulls away, leaving an empty bench. the camera moves upward, farther and farther away as the music swells and the credits roll.}
