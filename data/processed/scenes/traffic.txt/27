<A>__{castro makes a motion for him to be quiet and keeps moving toward the room of colored balls. gordon enters the restaurant and follows him. an animatronic band starts to play a song. gordon sees a half hidden foot buried underneath the plastic balls at the far end of the room. he takes careful aim and fires. ruiz screams and sits up. castro pounces on him, disarming him, and roughing him up.}
