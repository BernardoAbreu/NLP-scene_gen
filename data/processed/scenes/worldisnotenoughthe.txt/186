<L>__{interior room maiden's tower moments later}
<A>__{elektra opens a heavy door, she and renard past through to... a small room...a window set in the stone on one side. the other side is divided off by a wall of bars, creating a cell which now contains: m the cell is bare, except for a camp bed in the corner. m betrays no fear. a quiet defiance burns in her.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{just as i promised.}
<A>__{renard steps forward. bars separate him from m.}
<C>__{renard}
<D>__{my executioner.}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{over praise, i'm afraid. but my people will finish the job.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{your people? your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. you and my father. he didn't think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{your father...}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{is nothing. his kingdom he stole from my mother. the kingdom i will rightly take back.}
<A>__{elektra leaves. renard is left alone with m.}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{she's insane. is that what you did to her?}
<C>__{renard}
<D>__{no. i'm afraid it is what you did.}
<A>__{he crosses close to the bars.}
<C>__{renard}
<D>__{when i took her she was...promise itself. so clever, so vibrant, so...full of life force. and you left her there, at the mercy of a man like me. you ruined her. for what? to get to me? she is worth fifty of me.}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{for once, i agree with you.}
<A>__{he shakes his head, amused by her pluck.}
<C>__{m}
<D>__{so she used all that brilliance to get revenge on her father, on me.}
<C>__{renard}
<D>__{no. i wanted you. i wanted you for myself.}
<A>__{he takes something out of his pocket. a small travel clock. he sets it.}
<C>__{renard}
<D>__{since you sent your man to kill me, i have been watching time tick slowly away, marching inevitably toward my own death. watch these hands, m. at noon tomorrow, your time is up. and i guarantee you...i will not miss. you will die. along with everyone in this city and the future of the west.}
<A>__{he places the clock on a tall stool, just out of reach through her bars. he leaves. we hold on the clock: eight p.m.}
