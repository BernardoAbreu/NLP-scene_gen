<L>__{exterior street afternoon}
<A>__{a parking ticket sits under the wiper on nicole's windshield. tj and nicole approach the car, smiling and then nicole sees the ticket. her face sinks immediately.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{oh, no. please tell me that's not a ticket...}
<A>__{she runs the last few steps to the car and rips the ticket from under the wiper. she reads it quick.}
<C>__{nicole }
<D>__{fuck, fuck, fuck it.}
<A>__{she paces a couple of angry circles and then kicks the car's tire. it hurts her foot. she yelps.}
<C>__{nicole }
<D>__{ah, shit. fuck it.}
<A>__{in a small frenzy, she pulls her keys from her pocket and opens the car door. she gets in and slams the door behind her. she sits behind the wheel and yells, frustrated. tj stands in the street, uncomfortable, not knowing what to do. he goes to the car and gets in beside her. he sits, still not knowing what to say. she tries to settle herself, but she's still very emotional.}
<C>__{nicole }
<D>__{what have i done to deserve this chain reaction of shit all the time? sometimes i wonder if i were to die right now, if anyone would care, or even notice.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{i would.}
<A>__{she lets out a small disbelieving laugh.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{that's nice of you to say, but i doubt it.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{i would. if you died right now.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'd notice.}
<A>__{tj thinks a moment. it's a sweet and sour moment. he wants to cheer nicole up, but he's remembering his mom at the same time.}
<C>__{tj }
<D>__{mainly because i'd be sitting in a car with a dead lady.}
<A>__{nicole sniffs, smiling through her tears.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{please don't call me lady.}
<A>__{she smiles warmly at tj.}
<C>__{nicole }
<D>__{let's get out of here.}
<A>__{she puts the key in the ignition and turns it. nothing. nicole takes a breath not wanting to get upset again. she turns to tj and smiles sadly.}
<C>__{nicole }
<D>__{you wanna steer or push?}
