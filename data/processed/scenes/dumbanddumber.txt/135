<L>__{interior mutt cutts van sunny morning}
<A>__{it's bright daylight now. harry is sleeping peacefully in the passenger seat while lloyd sips a coffee. the van hits a bump which causes harry's eyes to flutter open.}

<P>__{(groggy)}

<C>__{harry}
<D>__{great. we must be getting real close, huh?}
<C>__{lloyd}

<C>__{harry}
<D>__{good man.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{boy, i will tell you, this is one angerous highway. you wouldn't believe all the road pizza two dead ogs, a couple of rabbits, a snake and some big thing i couldn't even recognize.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{that's awful. did you see them get hit or were they already lying there?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{i hit 'em.}
<A>__{harry rubs his eyes and looks at the passing flatlands.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{funny. i expected the rocky mountains to be a little rockier than this.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{i was thinking the same thing. that john denver's some full of shit, huh?}
<A>__{they both stare out the window.}
<C>__{lloyd }
<D>__{i must say, des moines sure is a pretty little town.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah, it really is.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{wait a minute when did you visit des moines?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{last night. we drove through it.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what are you talking about? you were snoring like a baby when we went through des moines.}
<A>__{lloyd shakes his head in amusement, then snaps his fingers in harry's face.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(sing song)}
<D>__{hello? hello? anybody home? rise and shine.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{you were the one who was asleep,}
<A>__{numbskull. here, take a sip of coffee. you're delirious. a confused harry sips the coffee and checks out the passing terrain. then something starts to awn on him. slowly.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{uh, lloyd, refresh my memory: doesn't the sun rise in the east and set in the west?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{in our country it does, yes.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{then perchance you can explain to me why the sun is in our face at 7:30 in the morning when we're heading west.}
<A>__{lloyd thinks about this and then looks sickened.}
