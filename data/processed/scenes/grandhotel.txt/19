<B>__{by elevator}
<A>__{pimenov and meierheim. meierheim is pushing the bell.}
<C>__{pimenov}
<D>__{how is the house?}
<C>__{meierheim}
<D>__{terrible. after this, no more ballets for me. jazz }
<P>__{(snaps his fingers)}
<D>__{just jazz.}
<C>__{pimenov}
<D>__{if the house is empty again, i don't know }
<C>__{meierheim}
<D>__{when she gets her paint on and hears the music she'll be all right. i know these people.}
<A>__{they are walking towards kringelein's room. they are pacing rather like men who walk the deck on a liner. they turn almost together, but when they turn back past the camera the camera proceeds on into kringelein's room. the camera enters the room to a burst of laughter. champagne bottles open, caviar, smoke, etc. in the room are the doctor, kringelein, the baron, flaemmchen, and a very fat waiter comedian.}
<C>__{kringelein}
<D>__{you may laugh. caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you, but to me they mean a great deal. you see, i'm ill and all of a sudden i got a fear of missing life. i don't want to miss life do you understand?}
<C>__{flaemmchen}
<D>__{you are funny. you speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.}
<C>__{kringelein}
<D>__{yes and for me, it's going to leave at any minute. let's drink.}
<A>__{the baron offers flaemmchen a glass of champagne. she shakes her head.}
<C>__{kringelein}
<D>__{i'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste distinctive, don't you think? velvet upholstery 'a number one'. i'm in the textile trade and i know.}
<P>__{(he has a slight case}
<D>__{of hiccups from the champagne. he touches}
<P>__{the drapes)}
<D>__{and these are real silk drapes.}
<C>__{flaemmchen}
<P>__{(amusedly)}
<D>__{silk think of that silk they are, too.}
<C>__{kringelein}
<P>__{(who hasn't stopped talking)}
<D>__{have you seen the bathroom? hot and cold running water you see, i can get a bath whenever i like.}
<A>__{at that moment preysing's voice is heard calling to the floor clerk.}
<C>__{preysing}
<D>__{the stenographer!}
<A>__{flaemmchen, hearing this, turns and looks off, apparently through the door. her manner changes, she puts down her glass.}
<C>__{flaemmchen}
<D>__{her master's voice!}
<P>__{(turns to baron)}
<D>__{i must go now goodbye thanks.}
<C>__{kringelein}
<D>__{oh, don't go.}
<C>__{flaemmchen}
<D>__{i'm engaged for the evening.}
<C>__{kringelein}
<D>__{oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?}
<C>__{flaemmchen}
<D>__{to take dictation a mr. preysing }
<P>__{(to baron)}
<D>__{goodbye, you tomorrow at five o'clock.}
<P>__{(she is moving out)}
<A>__{kringelein's optimism has left him for a moment, he stands looking out of door undecided, he is drooped suddenly, as though years had returned to him.}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{what's the matter, mr. kringelein?}
<C>__{kringelein}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{general director preysing!}
<P>__{(possibly he turns to baron)}
<D>__{baron, when i was sixteen years old, i started as an office boy in that man's factory }
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{then you know him?}
<C>__{kringelein}
<D>__{do i know him i know him through and through.}
<A>__{they start to leave. oh, gentlemen, please don't go.}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{i must i hope to see you again, mr. kringelein.}
<A>__{baron leaves.}
<C>__{kringelein}
<D>__{you will stay, doctor if you have nothing better to do?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{i have nothing better to do, mr. kringelein.}
<A>__{they move into the room.}
