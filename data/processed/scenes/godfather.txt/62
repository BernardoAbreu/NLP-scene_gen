<L>__{int nite: building (winter 1945)}
<A>__{the interior of an abandoned building. several men in suits and ties sit around in the booths. hagen sits in one: sollozzo sits across from him.}
<C>__{sollozzo}
<D>__{i know you're not in the muscle end of the family so i don't want you to be afraid. i want you to help the corleones and i want you to help me.}
<A>__{hagen's hands are trembling as he tries to put a cigarette in his mouth. one of the button men brings a bottle of rye to the table, and pours a little into a delicate, flowered china cup. hagen sips gratefully.}
<C>__{sollozzo}
<D>__{your boss is dead...}
<A>__{hagen is overwhelmed: actual tears spring to his eyes. sollozzo pauses respectfully.}
<C>__{sollozzo}
<P>__{(pushing the bottle)}
<D>__{have some more. we got him outside his office, just before i picked you up. you have to make the peace between me and santino.}
<A>__{hagen still is focused on the grief of losing the old man.}
<C>__{sollozzo}
<D>__{sonny was hot for my deal, right? you know it's the smart thing to do, too. i want you to talk sonny into it.}
<C>__{hagen}
<P>__{(pulling himself together)}
<D>__{sonny will come after you with everything he's got.}
<A>__{sollozzo rises, impatiently.}
<C>__{sollozzo}
<D>__{that's going to be his first reaction. you have to talk some sense into him. the tattaglia family stands behind me with all their people. the other new york families will go along with anything that prevents a full scale war.}
<A>__{he leans close to hagen.}
<C>__{sollozzo}
<D>__{the don was slipping; in the old days i could never have gotten to him. now he's dead, nothing can bring him back. talk to sonny, talk to the caporegimes, clemenza and tessio...it's good business.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{even sonny won't be able to call off luca brasi.}
<C>__{sollozzo}
<D>__{i will worry about luca. you take care of sonny and the other two kids.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{i will try...it's what the don would want us to do.}
<C>__{sollozzo}
<P>__{(lifting his hands in an expression of harmlessness)}
<D>__{good...then you can go...}
<P>__{(he escorts him to the door)}
<D>__{i don't like violence. i'm a businessman, and blood is a big expense.}
<A>__{he opens the door; they step out together.}
