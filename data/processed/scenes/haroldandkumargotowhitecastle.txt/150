<L>__{exterior cliff 6:40 am}
<A>__{we see the jeep stop just short of the cliff. harold and kumar get out of the jeep and walk over to the edge of the cliff and look down. it's a very steep drop. suddenly, kumar sees something out in the distance...}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{rold! look out there!}
<A>__{harold looks to where kumar is pointing it's a white castle way down below, about a mile away.}
<B>__{they then hear a police siren coming from back in the woods.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{oh shit! we're trapped!}
<A>__{kumar notices something...}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{not necessarily.}
<A>__{kumar walks over to the jeep and points to the hang glider...}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{no. no way. not a chance. i'd rather turn myself in than die.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{dude, it's okay. i used to hang glide with my dad all the time when i was kid. i know how to do it.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{you hang glided? i don't remember that.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{we did it on our trips to india. i swear. i know exactly what i'm doing. i've even done it with two people at the same time. my brother and i did it.}
<C>__{kumar }
<D>__{just hold onto the outside bars and let me take care of the rest.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{no, kumar. i'm not risking my life over a bunch of hamburgers.}
<A>__{kumar walks over to harold and stares him in the eye...}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{you think this just about the burgers, huh? well, let me tell you it's about far more than that.}
<A>__{kumar walks over to the edge of the cliff and looks out onto the early morning horizon. the sun is still rising. the scene is very picturesque...}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{our parents came to this country, escaping persecution, poverty, and hunger. hunger, harold. they were very, very hungry. and they wanted to live in a land that treated them as equals. a land where their kids could study and get into good colleges. a land filled with hamburger stands. and not just one type of hamburger. hundreds of types with different sizes, toppings, and condiments. that land was america.}
<B>__{the police siren is getting louder...}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(turning to rold)}
<D>__{you think this is just about the burgers? no. this is about achieving what our parents set out for. this is about the pursuit of happiness. this is about the american dream.}
<A>__{kumar walks over to harold.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{and so we've reached this pointerior the point which all men eventually have to face. the point of no return.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we can stay here, get arrested and end our hopes of ever going to white castle. or we can take the hang glider and make our leap towards freedom. i leave the decision up to you.}
<A>__{from the sound of the sirens, it seems that the police are getting closer. harold turns back, facing kumar...}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{i hate you, kumar.}
