<L>__{exterior wally's car on the road late at night}
<A>__{the lone car on the road. snatches of war news from the radio are the only sound as the headlights illuminate the dark highway.}
<L>__{exterior coast of maine morning}
<A>__{the car is parked, with homer sleeping in it alone. the sounds of the ocean increase as homer opens his eyes. homer gets out of the car and walks toward the beach, enchanted. there it is: his first view ever of an ocean, the horizon, the sun glimmering on the water. candy is lying on a blanket in the sand. wally is throwing rocks in the water. homer takes it all in. when candy calls for him, homer walks up to her.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{i'm a little worried about the...}
<P>__{(she gestures below her waist)}
<D>__{...about how much bleeding is okay.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{it should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. you have cramps?}
<P>__{(candy nods)}
<D>__{they'll ease up, almost entirely. as long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.}
<C>__{wally }
<D>__{catch!}
<A>__{a football comes flying through the air toward homer; it bounces off his chest. wally laughs.}
<C>__{wally}
<P>__{(meaning the football)}
<D>__{give it here!}
<A>__{homer throws the football; it's clear he's never thrown one before.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{what was that?! come over here!}
<A>__{homer runs over to wally, who proceeds to show him how to pass the ball. snatches of his instruction drift to candy, who closes her eyes. "put your fingers on the laces no, it rests in your palm, like this! you want the laces up yes, like that!"}
