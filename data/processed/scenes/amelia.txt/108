<L>__{interior hangar night}
<A>__{massive enclosed space. the rebuilt electra in pieces at various work stations, being perfected by teams of mechanics. the whirr and clang of tools. amelia and george confer with one foreman, as george sees something. he touches her arm, points in our direction. reverse angle as she sees... ...gene has entered the hangar. stands by the folding table we've seen before.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{have fun.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{who let you off the hook on this?}
<A>__{she takes his hand firmly and together they cross the hangar toward gene. he smiles, unfolds a third chair. as they arrive, amelia steps forward... ...kisses gene on the cheek. george shakes his hand.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{thanks for letting me come.}
<A>__{as they sit, gene looks from one to the other.}
<P>__{gene (cont’d)}
<D>__{i guess i'm already outvoted.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{she'd outvote you all by herself. she does it to me every day.}
<A>__{gene's smile can't mask the concern in his eyes.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{i don't have a choice. i have to reverse my route and fly east. if i go west now, i'm risking hurricanes in the caribbean and monsoons in africa...}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{but you're flying howland last, when you're exhausted.}
<A>__{she knows this. in the silence...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{gene, this way our first leg is oakland to miami. it's a shakedown to make sure the plane is right. that's crucial.}
<A>__{gene nods, slowly. his eyes still locked on her.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{maybe i'm obsessing on howland because it was my bright idea, and i'd feel responsible if...}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{well, if i do pop off, i will try to make it somewhere that's not your fault.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{i'd appreciate that.}
<A>__{draws a breath.}
<P>__{gene (cont’d)}
<D>__{you miss that island. you'll be out of fuel, with 2000 miles to go.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{but i will have fred so i won't miss. in fact, i'm taking fred along for this whole trip.}
<A>__{surprisingly, he doesn't seem to like this. she smiles.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{giving up my little arrogance about solo. safety first, yes?}
<A>__{but he's still unhappy. she waits for him to say.}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{you and fred alone for a month...}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{if you're worried about his drinking, i will deal with it.}
<A>__{straight look.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{i can handle fred.}
<A>__{and now we get a sense of exactly what does worry him. he glances to george...}
<C>__{gene}
<D>__{how do you feel?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{tip top. every little girl needs a man around. even strong girls like ours, hmmn?}
<A>__{a very direct gaze. words neither said nor needed.}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{she can handle us. she can handle fred.}
<A>__{a full beat. the look holds between the men.}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{and thanks for being here. you've always had amelia's best interests at heart.}
<A>__{the look still unbroken.}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{and, for that. i'm grateful.}
