<L>__{interior church, shelbourne, 2004}
<A>__{we move to the third or fourth row, where, from behind, we see a head of grey hair. he slowly turns around, casting a look towards the door and revealing a glimpse of his face. though it's aged slightly, it hasn't softened.}
<L>__{exterior church, shelbourne, 2004}
<A>__{jackie and starks watch as the people file out of church. they are leaning against her car when starks spots him. dr. becker walks beside a small child presumably his grandson. jackie registers his formidableness with some surprise; becker's maintained a strong physique and is hardly a shade less intimidating than he was before. only his hand has a permanent shake now. starks doesn't waste any time. he heads straight for him. almost sensing him, becker looks in his direction. the casual look on his face is instantly supplanted by one of disbelief.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{you still go to church. how's that work? your god just doesn't notice? that it? [beat, serious] how you doin', dr. becker?}
<A>__{becker stops walking and looks at starks. his grandson looks at him.}
<C>__{becker's grandson}
<D>__{grandpa? becker [still looking at starks] sean, why don't you wait for me by the car? i will be there in a minute. [turning to the kid] ok?}
<A>__{his grandson, momentarily appeased, heads for the car.}
<D>__{becker [to starks] can i help you?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i don't know, dr. becker. can you?}
<A>__{that's enough to confirm for becker who starks is. all around them, people leaving church socialize routinely unaware of the haunted history being made between them.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i think you know. your eyes say you do.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{[beat] you're his son?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{no. i'm not his son. i'm him. [beat] what? you look like you've seen a ghost. you can come here and touch me, old man. i'm the real thing.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{how...how are you here?}
<A>__{starks looks at becker each a terrifying reminder of the other's past.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{you died, starks. years ago, in the hospital.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i know. [beat] you killed me, didn't you?}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{no. i didn't. i swear i didn't. i probably helped push you to kill yourself, but i didn't do it.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i didn't kill myself. i died from a blow to the head. how'd it happen? i have to know.}
<A>__{becker looks at him, nearly too stunned to speak.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{i don't know how you died. the last time i put you in the jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer...}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i didn't say i remembered killing him. i just repeated some words to get myself back in there.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{i know. [beat] i knew that when you came out.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{because...because you came out and said something you couldn't have possibly have known. you came back and repeated three names...}
<A>__{becker falters as he recalls his offenses.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{of people like you. people i was just trying to help. they couldn't get worse so i thought, with medication, they might get...}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{medication? what kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{it was part of the treatment i intended...i didn't know what the effects would be...}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{so, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{the three of you weren't regular patients. you were criminals that ended up at alpine grove.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{no, we were patients.}
<A>__{becker concedes after all this time.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{you and the others didn't seem that way then.}
<A>__{starks is quiet as he comes to understand how it's about to work out: if becker tells him those names now, he essentially indicts himself.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{who were the others?}
<A>__{becker remembers with a hint of remorse.}
<D>__{becker [racked with remorse] nathan piechowski, jackson macgregor, and ted casey. [beat] i didn't ask for you for any of you. you were all sent to me.}
<A>__{starks looks at becker, in astonishment.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{starks just stares at becker, waiting for the realization to hit him, too.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{how did you come to know their names?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{you just told me. the last time i was with you was when i was in the jacket. i'm in it right now, dr. becker.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{i don't understand...}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i'm in it as we speak. [beat] you're haunting yourself right now. [beat] i guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. you didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, dr. becker. it turned out different, didn't it?}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{i didn't put you in alpine grove.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{no. [beat] you put me on drugs and then you put me in the jacket. becker [stoically] i was sorry when i heard you died. i was, but...how was i to know you didn't shoot that police officer?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{the same way you just said i didn't without my ever telling you. [beat] and that still doesn't excuse what you did. just because you had keys to a cage didn't mean you had animals inside. [beat] you've earned your guilt, becker.}
<A>__{starks shares a last look with becker before he walks away towards the car.}
