<A>__{kelly sits on the toilet, putting a bandage on a red scrape down his arm. eve appears in the doorway.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{oh kelly. what happened?}
<A>__{kelly looks up at her. he's still got the cut eyebrow, which has split back open, and some dried blood under his nose.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{jesus. let me see that.}
<A>__{eve comes over and tilts kelly's head back to look at the cut. this is the first time she's touched him. she gets some antiseptic and ointment from under the sink along with band aids and goes to work.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{ow.}
<A>__{kelly lets her dab at his face. he closes his eyes.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i'm going over to see dad.}
<A>__{kelly opens his eyes and pulls away.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{eve puts a butterfly bandage across kelly's eyebrow.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{and you need to come.}
<A>__{kelly pulls his head away.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i don't want to.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{at this point that's not an option.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{now's not a good time, ma.}
<A>__{eve looks at kelly sadly.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{it's never a good time.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{you can't make me.}
<A>__{eve shakes her head.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(voice rising)}
<D>__{it's not about you anymore }
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{don't you get it? it was never about me.}
<A>__{eve rises to her feet. he's just sent her over the edge.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{what is wrong with you? when are you going to stop blaming us, blaming him? i'm sick of you being angry. i want to be angry! they just took out half of your father's stomach }
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{enough.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(screaming and crying)}
<D>__{you will not tell me what's enough. you don't know about anything. all you do is fight fake battles, in the woods, on the playground. but this, right here, us this is the real one, the only one worth anything.}
<A>__{she stops and breaks down.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{the man i love is dying.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{that's between you and him.}
<A>__{eve looks at her son. her face looks older.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{if i made a mistake, if you felt left out, i'm sorry. but i can only deal with one thing at a time.}
<A>__{eve leaves. kelly sits on the toilet, lost.}
