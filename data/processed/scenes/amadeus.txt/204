<D>__{she's not coming back, you know. she's gone for good. i did it and i'm proud of it. 'leave,' i said. 'right away! take he child and go, just go. here's the money! go to the spa and get your health back that's if you can.' i was shocked. shocked to my foundation. is that my girl? can that be my stanzi? the happy little moppet i brought up, that poor trembling thing? oh, you monster! no one exists but you, do they? you and your music! do you know how often she's sat in that very chair, weeping her eyes out of her head because of you? i warned her. 'choose a man, not a baby,' i said. but would she listen? who listens? 'he's just a silly boy,' she says. silly, my arse. selfish that's all you are. selfish! selfish, selfish, selfish, selfish, selfish.}
