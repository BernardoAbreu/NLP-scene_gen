<L>__{exterior high road night}
<A>__{george on his motorbike, covered by a few bars of buffalo springfield's 'for what it's worth,' has thrown on a peacoat but kept on his velvet trousers. he's riding up what should now be a familiar road to jill's. the lights from the city below flash in and out of view. jill's garage george pulls in. her slot in the three car garage is empty, only the oil slick stares at him. there's the sound of a car coming down the road. he looks up expectantly. as it comes by the morning newspaper is tossed at his feet. george turns and fishes in the hanging planter by the door. he pulls out a key, blows the dirt off it and goes inside.}
