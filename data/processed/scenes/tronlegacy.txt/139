<L>__{interior power supply core cube}
<A>__{rush and mega duck inside entry point, pelted by disks. before them: a vast, brilliant, energized lattice. power surges in rings, drawing down huge columns. every piece of geometry is based on perfect squares, made of mirror finished rare earth elements. rush pulls the hologon key into view. facets resonate with energy patterns like those in the core.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{we plug this into the control cell, x net is history.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{let's do it for flynn.}
<A>__{they share a heartbeat of solidarity. rivalry gone. x takks stream in, firing. rush and mega charge the center, throwing disks, fighting back to back. problem is, energy rings move continuously down the columns and the columns are spaced close leaving just enough time between ring passes to jump through.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{now!}
<A>__{he and mega jump, nearly raked by down flowing energy rings. x takks fire negabyte blasters but many of the beams are caught in the energy flow and sucked away. that's how intense this place is. x takk soldier is grazed, stumbles into energy column. ring rakes down and zaps him nasty reducing him to bits, sucking his energy to the levels below. rush and mega encounter oncoming x takks they must split up. they fling disks, taking out x takks, dodging fire working their way deeper. meg and rush throw their disks simultaneously. both disks score hits, then arc to return. rush and mega catch each other's disk. they each look at the strange disks it's just not the same. the do a quick swap and keep fighting.}
