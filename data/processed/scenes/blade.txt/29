<L>__{interior whistler's workshop day}
<A>__{beyond the grimy outer windows, we can see that the day is closing long shadows, amber light. karen lingers in the doorway, reeling from information overload. blade begins suiting up for his nightly hunt strapping on body armor, loading ammunition. he strings the tarnished locket around his neck as if it were an amulet that could ward off evil, then pauses to inspect a modified pistol, sighting down the length of it.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{we hunt them, moving from one city to the next, tracking their migrations. they're hard to kill. they tend to regenerate.}
<A>__{clack! blade pulls the trigger on an empty chamber, then checks his next weapon }
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{so what do you use, then? a stake?}
<C>__{whistler}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{some of the old wives' tales are true they're severely allergic to silver, various types of wood. feed them garlic and they'll go into anaphylactic shock }
<A>__{whistler picks up a customized rifle with a uv entry light, flicking on the beam.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{ and of course there's always sunlight, ultra violet rays.}
<A>__{karen shakes her head, incredulous }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{and you honestly expect me to believe all this?}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{i don't care what you believe. i saved your life once, i don't plan on making a habit of it. you want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. if you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i can't just leave. i have a life here, a career }
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{not anymore. you've seen one of them. you won't be allowed to live after that.}
<A>__{karen stares at blade. whistler gestures to the windows }
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{there's a war going on out there. blade, myself, a few others we've tried to keep it from spilling over onto the streets.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{sometimes people like yourself get caught in the cross fire.}
<A>__{whistler shrugs. as far as he's concerned, there's nothing else to say. karen is still protesting, though.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i can go to the police. i have blood samples back at the hospital. i can show them.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{do it. you'll be dead before you can file the complainterior}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{that's ridiculous! no one's that powerful.}
<A>__{whistler sighs. he doesn't suffer fools gladly.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{you're talking about a brotherhood that predates the catholic church by thousands of years. their survival depends on their ability to blend in. chances are, you've encountered them and not even known it. on the subway, in a bar }
<A>__{blade slings his car 15 onto his shoulder, impatient. he starts towards the olds, gesturing.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{get in. youre leaving.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{wait.}
<A>__{whistler tosses a small metal canister to karen.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{consider it a parting gift. vampire mace silver nitrate, essence of garlic.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(in disbelief)}
<D>__{so that's it? you guys just patch me up and send me on my way?}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{there is one other thing. i'd buy yourself a gun if i were you. if you start becoming sensitive to the daylight, if you start becoming thirsty regardless of much you've had to drink then i suggest you take that gun and use it on yourself. better that, than the alternative.}
<A>__{karen stares at whistler, horrified, as we }
