<L>__{interior creek house night}
<A>__{grace is fast asleep, exhausted. she does not stir when the phone rings. annie picks up from her own bed, awakened, still dressed in her branding clothes, having just passed out on the bed.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{hello?}
<L>__{interior central park went apartment night intercut: robert, alone, in the vast apartment.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{i thought you guys were going to call me.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{oh, robert, i'm sorry. we were so tired from the branding. grace barely made it to her bed and i didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{oh well... branding will do that to you.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{everything all right.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{huh huh. you?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{fine. actually, today was a good day. you should have seen her.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{i wish i did.}
<A>__{the sound of self pity was so obvious for both of them, so robert quickly re groups, resorting to something he knows is important to her;}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{well, uh the real reason i called, actually, was to tell you i saw lucy at jo jo's tonight and she seems very worried.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{apparently, gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. she said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{oh. i didn't look at my faxes today. we left before sunrise.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{honey, i hope you're not endangering your position. listen, if you need to come back and you want me to come take over, for a while, i will work it out. i mean, the firm's got other lawyers, but the magazine's got only one of you.}
<A>__{after a day of hard work and simple pleasures, annie begins to succumb to old anxieties and pressures.}
