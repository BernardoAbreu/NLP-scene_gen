<L>__{interior laboratory night}
<A>__{metal scraping. piano accordion music wafts on a breeze, someone breathing. high angle down through an opening metal hatch. a dim laboratory is revealed a maze of scientific instruments. elongated shadows move about. mystery men are hunched over something. behind them a diagrammatic chart of the evolution of the human brain. man 1 bends across to a control panel, works a switch. a small speaker in a metal box crackles to life. sound of distant surf. a woman's voice:}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{what is your name... what is your name...}
<A>__{wires lead from the metal box to a human brain within a metallic container. electricity arches across electrodes. more sounds from the speaker: water bubbling. high heels walk down stairs. bed springs. lovers moan passionately. man 2 steps forward and pulls a bloodied sheet from their handiwork. a puppet like creature is revealed. small two and half feet tall. the top of its head an open hatch containing the brain. wires lead to this. tight on puppet's eyes they glance about the room. its body is a series of geometric shapes and polished surfaces. man 1 shines a torch into the puppet's eyes.}
<B>__{inside its head}
<A>__{gears turn, illuminated by the beam of the light. the gears part slowly to reveal a small writhing insect screwed to a metal plate. man 2 shows the puppet photographs: white as he looks currently, shots of him as a teenager, a young boy, a baby. photos of what we realise are his parents, standing on a seaside pier sirtiling and waving. where he went to school. a red push bike he owned as a boy. his first sweetheart. then a photo of a young woman smiling his wife. man 3 holds up a small sea shell to the mechanical ear of the puppet creature more sounds of surf... a figure clutching a wooden cane looks on from the shadows. his pale hand fondles the ornate handle of his cane a carved silver insect. it's mister black. man 3 steps up to him.}
<C>__{mister black}
<D>__{you have duplicated the personality, yes.}
<C>__{man 3}
<D>__{it is ready. the doctor was most helpful.}
<A>__{mister black turns towards the other men.}
<C>__{mister black}
<D>__{i hear a clock in my head, and i like it!}
<C>__{men }
<D>__{we hear clocks in our heads, and we like it!}
<C>__{mister black}
<D>__{a world in our likeness!}
<C>__{men}
<D>__{a world in our likeness!}
<A>__{the men close the hatch in the top of the puppet's head. squeak... clunk! the puppet tests out its many weapons, a series of nasty looking blades snap out of its small body, then retract.}
