<A>__{patients undress in the bare bones locker area. an uneasy miranda is handed a bar of soap and towel by irene.}

<D>__{now come on. if you go downtown, you gotta dance.}
<A>__{miranda studies the patients already under the spray of the shower. something vaguely concentration camp like about institutional bathing. the shower, like everything else in this place, is regulated by shifts, so that various groupings of patients each get their turn. miranda feels chloe's gaze on her across the room. she is stripping off her clothes for miranda's benefit, gleefully mangling the last refrain from the stones' "start me up."}

<P>__{(checking watch)}
<D>__{that's five minutes, group one.}
<P>__{(to chloe's group)}
<D>__{alright, ladies, nice and easy.}
<A>__{the first group of bathers file out, dripping wet past miranda, in all shapes and sizes. she registers their many scars and tattoos, like maps of troubled souls: names of men, places, religious quotes. burn scars, cuts, needle marks. they begin to towel off as miranda, slowly and painfully self conscious, begins to undress in the corner. a moment later irene nods for her to go in.}
