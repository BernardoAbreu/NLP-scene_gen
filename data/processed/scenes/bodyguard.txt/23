<L>__{interior room day}
<A>__{frank follows spector and devaney into the room. he glances around, taking in the murals, the decor, the kitsch attempt at fornicatorial splendour right from the pages of a tabloid layout.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{is this her bedroom?}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{no. she sleeps in a room next to fletcher's down the hall. sy had this done for a magazine layout,}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{'superstars in their boudoirs.' did you see it?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{rachel never liked it.}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{she didn't have to like it...}
<A>__{devaney gently lays the cut out letter on the bed.}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{we found the letter here.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{somebody was in here?}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{somebody broke in and ... masturbated on the bed.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{and she doesn't know about this either?}
<A>__{devaney shakes his head.}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{are you kidding? this would really freak her out.}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{someone penetrates the house, gets upstairs and jerks off on the bed ... i'd say that qualifies as a problem.}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{what kind of problem?}
<C>__{spector}
<P>__{(agitated)}
<D>__{of fuck, we don't need this now...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{this house is wide open.}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i said this house is wide open and you people have no clue what real security is or what it takes to achieve it.}
<C>__{devaney}
<P>__{(does a quick read on frank)}
<D>__{frank, i totally respect what you're telling me. tell me how you want to work and i will accommodate you.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{look, i can't protect her. i won't be responsible for her safety if she doesn't know what's going on.}
<C>__{devaney}
<D>__{i will talk to her, i will make her understand. i can do that.}
<C>__{spector}
<D>__{no. i will talk to her.}
<A>__{spector exits the room in a huff.}
