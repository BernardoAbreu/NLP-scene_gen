<A>__{jackie abruptly runs after him.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{hey, wait!}
<A>__{starks stops in his tracks; he clears as much sadness from his face as he can before he turns around to face her.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{[beat] you be good to yourself, jackie.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{then, suddenly, she sticks her hand for him to shake, as she did that day on the roadside; only now, it trembles slightly in the cold. starks takes jackie's hand and holds it in his own softly and affectionately. jean and dr. lorenson look on curiously as starks looks in her face, at her hand in his, and then to the heavens for the means to get through this. as starks lets go at last, jackie looks back at him, sensing the connection even if she doesn't know it yet. starks turns and stumbles as he walks back to his car. lorenson moves to help him, but starks tells her not to with his eyes. he makes his way to the car on his own.}
