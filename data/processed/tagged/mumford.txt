<D>__{"mumford" screenplay by lawrence kasdan}
<C>__{shooting draft}
<L>__{exterior main street, small town day}
<A>__{a freight truck of late 1950's vintage pulls to the side of the road in a small rural town. a handsome, well built man gets out of the passenger side and thanks the driver. the newcomer carries his coat over his shoulder and a beat up suitcase; he's got a jut jaw and a modified pompadour, his shirtsleeves are rolled all the way up past his biceps. he wipes his brow against the sweltering heat and looks around. [until noted below, this section of the movie is in black & white.]}
<C>__{follett }
<D>__{i get outta the truck in this two bit town. i got no money and no prospects. what i need right now is a stiff drink, a cold shower, and a hot broad. i will take 'em in any order they come...}
<L>__{exterior boarding house day}
<A>__{old three story gothic house in ill repair beyond a peeling picket fence and a scruffy yard. the sign says rooms to rent. the newcomer goes in the gate.}
<C>__{follett }
<D>__{...oh yeah, one other thing i need an angle.}
<A>__{he squints through the dirty screen door but sees nothing, then knocks and turns away to survey the neighborhood.}
<C>__{follett }
<D>__{i was thinking if it weren't for bad luck, i wouldn't have any luck at all...}
<C>__{landlady }
<D>__{can i help you?}
<A>__{the newcomer turns toward the door. standing there, holding the screen open, is the landlady. she's a knockout in a cheap, small town way: a cotton dress that buttons down the front and clings with sweat to her generous curves.}
<C>__{follett }
<D>__{either my luck had just changed, or fate just bought me another round of trouble.}
<L>__{interior boarding house day}
<A>__{the newcomer's pov of the landlady as she leads him up the narrow, gloomy stairs from the second floor to the third story attic. she has a monroe like sway to her walk. we can barely hear her distant, echoey dialogue:}
<C>__{landlady}
<D>__{...not very fancy... house needs repairs... we haven't had a man around here for so long...}
<C>__{follett }
<D>__{she kept yammerin' the whole time, but her hips were doing all the talking...}
<A>__{the landlady reaches the tiny landing at the top of the stairs and opens a door to a squalid room with a bed, bureau and tiny window. the newcomer has to squeeze by her voluptuous body to get inside and look around. it doesn't take long. his gaze returns to the landlady who is leaning against the door, chest thrust forward. he focusses on her fingers, toying with the button at her sweat shiny cleavage.}
<C>__{follett }
<D>__{it couldn't 'a been any clearer what the set up was. the next move was up to me...}
<A>__{the newcomer takes a step in the landlady's direction }
<C>__{mumford }
<D>__{don't tell me!}
<L>__{interior mumford's office (present) day}
<A>__{close up of mumford wincing.}
<C>__{mumford}
<P>__{(softer)}
<D>__{ that's all the time we have. sorry...}
<P>__{(indicates his watch)}
<D>__{...next time.}
<A>__{we see mumford's office: the office of a psychologist, a therapist with a doctorate. it's modest, comfortable, neat, with a calm, relaxed ambience. [the movie is now in color.] his patient, henry follett, looks nothing like the newcomer in the soft core fantasy he's been narrating. instead, he's a mild looking pharmacist with glasses and a receding hairline. only the voice is the same; it's as studly as his fantasy alter ego. follett has been lying on a couch, but now has twisted with some irritation to look at mumford.}
<C>__{follett}
<D>__{i have eighteen more minutes!}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{i don't want to hear any more today.}
<C>__{follett}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{mr. follett, do you trust me or don't you?}
<C>__{follett}
<D>__{well, i don't know... i only been seeing you }
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{without trust, there's no point to any of this. you might as well not come.}
<C>__{follett}
<D>__{now hold on, i didn't say i didn't want to come }
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{good, then go.}
<L>__{interior lily's cafe day}
<A>__{lunch crowd. mumford can be seen out the big front window, crossing from the two story building that houses his office on the main drag of this small town which, oddly enough, is also called mumford. he comes inside and goes to the counter to pick up some take out. the proprietor is a woman around forty named lily, who talks to him as she works.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{you're early... it's not ready. what happened?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{my patient had to leave early.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{who was that?}
<A>__{she comes over to the register with an order. mumford is am[...] her, likes her a lot.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{does the phrase "nosy" have any meaning to you, lily?}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{i think it's like... inquisitive.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{it was henry follett.}
<C>__{lily}
<P>__{(reacts)}
<D>__{man, you see him a lot. and it's very wrong to reveal it. next you'll be saying what his problem is.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{what do you want to know?}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{you're terrible. i'm never telling you anything.}
<A>__{a patron passes on the way out.}
<C>__{patron}
<D>__{hey, doc... how's it going?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{fine, vincent... how's yourself?}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{how long you been in this town?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{oh, i don't know...}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{four months, two and a half weeks that's how long.}
<P>__{(mumford gives her a look)}
<D>__{and you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{lily, i don't think even you could know that }
<A>__{lily sees something out the window.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{look at that guy...}
<A>__{mumford turns to look out the window. a young man of about}
<L>__{30, in jeans and a hawaiian shirt, is skateboarding down the}
<A>__{street at high speed, weaving in and out amongst the cars. he zips past the front of the restaurant.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{you know who that is, don't you?}
<P>__{(mumford does not)}
<D>__{you really don't? that's skip skipperton, man. he gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{oh, so that's him? the panda man.}
<A>__{lily hands over mumford's bagged order, rings it up. back on track:}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{so, what makes you so popular? what's your secret?}
<C>__{mumford}
<P>__{(takes his bag to go)}
<D>__{you like me. how come?}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{not sure. let me think about it.}
<A>__{mumford is smiling as he goes out. another patron, lionel dillard, a lawyer, brings his check to lily, watching mumford cross the street. lily can't stand this guy.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{that's the new psychiatrist?}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{psychologist. he's not medical.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{probably thinks he's pretty smart.}
<A>__{lily gives him a look as she takes his money.}
<L>__{interior mumford's office day}
<A>__{an overweight, teenage girl named nessa watkins is on mumford's couch. she fidgets as she talks and can't decide whether to lie down (so she's looking away from him) or sit up and face him. she plays with an unlit cigarette and keeps taking out a lighter, then stuffing it back in her big, sloppy handbag.}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{...so he already had the tattoo that said, "naomi forever"... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. but while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets chandra. and it's serious, immediate love. so in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in north america.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{what do you mean, "in no time"?}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{in maybe three or four issues.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{weekly or monthly?}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{monthly! god, how shallow do you think brad is? why do i waste my time telling you this stuff?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{why do you think you tell me, nessa?}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{don't do that thing...}
<P>__{(mumford: what?)}
<D>__{...that shrink thing.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{it's a big part of the show.}
<A>__{she jams the cigarette in her mouth and flames the lighter, but is afraid to actually break his rules.}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{you really need to let people smoke in here, you know. it's perverse. what are they paying you to see me?}
<A>__{mumford indicates "nothing".}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{the school board doesn't pay you? what kind of deal is that?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{it's called pro bono.}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{pro boner?}
<P>__{(he waits her out)}
<D>__{pro bono, huh? for whose good, supposedly?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{it's my bit for the community.}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{fuck the community.}
<P>__{(he won't go for it)}
<D>__{there was this article my friends and i read. it was "25 signs he's great in bed". it was very fascinating.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{where was this?}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{where?... the new york times. the first one was "he handles produce well." which we already knew!}
<P>__{(an expression she uses)}
<D>__{the point is, you have a lot of the signs.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{you been spying on me in the supermarket, nessa?}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{have women found you attractive?}
<A>__{mumford laughs.}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{i knew you wouldn't answer. i've been thinking about what you said last time. how me trying to lose weight and constantly not is like a lot of people with addictions. how maybe i can't lose the weight, ever...}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{which we already knew...}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{that's not quite what i said }
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{it's a really weird thing for a shrink to say... and then you said maybe people'd be happier if they'd accept that some things don't change that it'd be some kind of a relief or something...}
<A>__{mumford waits.}
<C>__{nessa}
<D>__{well, i guess i'm just a dumb bitch, but how depressing is that moment the moment when you give up?}
<L>__{exterior hiking trail, mountain forest magic}
<A>__{the last rays of sun are fighting their way through the trees as mumford comes up the trail he clearly knows very well.}
<L>__{exterior big rock lookout point magic}
<A>__{mumford climbs out on the big rock, settles himself on the edge and takes a long drink from a water bottle. what he sees: far below at the foot of these hills, lights just twinkling on, is the town of mumford. he stares at it for several long moments. then he takes a small headlamp from his pack and fits the straps over his head (it looks like a miner's light). he twists the light on to test it and turns his head to watch the beam move about.}
<T>__{we cut back wide:}
<A>__{. after a beat, mumford settles back and turns off the light.}
<L>__{interior scattergood's tavern night}
<A>__{the place is quietly busy with the regulars. mumford has a favorite spot at the far end of the bar. right now he's sitting alone, reading the remnants of a newspaper. skip skipperton, the man on the skateboard, comes in. everyone in the bar is surprised to see skip in here. several patrons greet him as he makes his way deeper inside, looking around. he's uncomfortable. he seems relieved when he spots mumford and heads back there. mumford doesn't notice skip waiting for his attention.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{mumford looks up, smiles. skip offers his hand.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{you're doc mumford.}
<P>__{(mumford nods)}
<D>__{skip skipperton.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{how are you?}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{fine. okay. pretty good. i've been hoping we'd meet. i've heard a lot about you.}
<A>__{mumford waits, friendly. skip runs out of gas, gets uneasy, glances around.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{do you think we could...? can i buy you a drink?}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{[...] later. in a booth near the back. they've been at it a while, but nothing is clear to mumford, yet. skip keeps his voice down; he doesn't want anyone else in the bar to hear him.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{..."find the need and fill it" my dad used to say i guess a lot of dads say that but i did and it just took off.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{no kidding... panda. where'd that come from?}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{panda? i've always liked giant pandas... i've been to china and seen them in the wild. that's the kind of thing i can do if i want... now. i can do pretty much anything i want to do these days.}
<A>__{skip stares into his beer for a moment, as though the thought depresses him. he catches himself and snaps back }
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{so now we make 23% of the modems in the market, which is pretty good.}
<A>__{skip glances around, leans in, confidential.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{when i was growing up here, the town was about dead. the timber business was played out... panda changed all that. now, just about everybody in town either works for the company or depends on it somehow. which is kinda the problem...}
<A>__{mumford waits, watches. skip gets uncomfortable.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{would you like another beer?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{nah... scotch.}
<C>__{skip}
<P>__{(brightens, like a kid)}
<D>__{far out. single malt?}
<P>__{(gets up)}
<D>__{can i pick it?}
<A>__{skip heads off to the bar. mumford looks around. everybody is watching.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{later. the bar crowd has thinned. both mumford and skip have had a few. in fact, mumford is now carefully pouring them each another drink from a bottle of glensomething on the table.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{you want me... to be... your friend.}
<A>__{skip beams. mumford leans forward in the same confidential way skip did before; he indicates that skip should lean in too. mumford is almost whispering }
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{but that's not what's really going on...}
<P>__{(skip is excited)}
<D>__{...what's really going on is... you have some problems and you want some therapy, but you feel it could be very bad for panda modem stock if word got out that you were having head problems.}
<A>__{skip confirms that's it.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{can i ask you a personal question?}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{of course! that's exactly what i want.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{have you thought about getting a wife?}
<A>__{skip makes a face and gesture to indicate a large "yes!", but also total frustration and failure.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{when panda started to happen, i was dating women from new york, san francisco, l.a. they came out of the woodwork. models, actresses, venture capitalists... these were not the kind of girls who were interested in me before i hit it... and you know what i discovered? i discovered these girls did not love me for myself. the majority of them didn't even like me. but a lot of them would've gladly become mrs. skipperton for a while. can you imagine that marrying someone just because they've got money?}
<A>__{mumford considers that.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{i gotta pee.}
<P>__{(he gets up, a little wobbly)}
<D>__{can i ask you something? this town is called mumford... been that way since... 18... 18 0... 18 0...}
<P>__{(finally remembers)}
<D>__{...thirteen! right?}
<P>__{(mumford: if you say so)}
<D>__{now here's the question your name is mumford, too.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{is that the question?}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{you moved here from back east and your name is the same as this town. is that right?}
<P>__{(mumford shrugs)}
<D>__{far out.}
<A>__{skip takes a few steps toward the men's room, then comes back and leans down toward mumford.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{i hope you don't think i want you to do this for free. just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean i won't pay you like a doctor.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{i understand.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{i have a lot of money. do you know how much money i've got?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{don't tell me, 'cause i'm not going to tell you what i've got.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{i've got three big ones.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{i'm impressed. i couldn't make three million dollars if i lived three lifetimes.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{no, no... i have three billion dollars.}
<A>__{skip stumbles off to take a leak. mumford takes a moment to digest that. it's difficult.}
<L>__{interior mumford's office day}
<A>__{mumford is listening to lionel, the arrogant lawyer who asked about him in the restaurant. lionel is lying on the couch, talking with enormous energy; he has a serious superiority complex. mumford can't stand him and the session seems to be lasting an eternity.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{...so i'm watching brokaw and they've got some astronomer, this little limey know it all, and he's telling how, with this himball telescope, they've discovered there are maybe 400 million more galaxies than they thought there were. and i guess that's supposed to make me feel small? i'm supposed to feel insignificant? is that the point? because i can tell you it didn't.}
<A>__{mumfords eyes dart to look at the clock on the bookshelf: 2:23}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{lionel, since this is our first session together, maybe }
<A>__{lionel is twisting his neck around painfully to look back at mumford.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{ you can sit up and look at me if you'd like }
<P>__{(lionel waves that off and looks away)}
<D>__{ maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{kind of impatient for a big time headshrinker, aren't you? how 'bout you let me explain it my own way...}
<A>__{as lionel goes on, mumford's eyes again dart toward the clock: still 2:23! hold on it. finally, it moves. mumford's eyes dart toward his desk a deadly looking letter opener in the shape of excalibur stands glinting light in a marble rendition of arthur's stone.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{...and in the dream, it's always the same, i wake up in my room from when i was i kid in ohio, and i realize this is the day of the big exam at school...}
<A>__{mumford's head rocks slowly back for a moment as if he's going to drift off. he snaps back to life and stares hard at the top of lionel's head, where there is a bald spot starting to take hold. the sound of lionel's voice begins to echo }
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{...which is no problem for me, because i remembered it was coming and i've attended every class, so i'm totally prepared. then i see myself running down the hall at school...}
<A>__{mumford's glance flashpans from lionel's bald spot to the gleaming letter opener. mumford closes his eyes. we cut to:}

<A>__{a boy, unmistakably the young lionel, runs down the deserted hallway toward a bright doorway. [lionel's dream has a blue tinterior]}

<A>__{young lionel comes breathlessly in the classroom door and stares alarmed.}
<C>__{lionel }
<D>__{and even though i arrive a little bit early, everybody's already there. but the surprising part is }
<A>__{what young lionel sees: everyone in the class, including the teacher in the front, is naked. the teacher holds out an exam toward young lionel.}

<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{ you crazy? you can't do this!}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{sure i can, lionel.}

<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{when did you start to feel this way?}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{about six months ago, i guess it is now. god, it seems like years. what a bore! i'm embarrassed by it. before this happened when i'd hear people talk about this kind of thing i thought it was a bunch of bullshit.}

<A>__{tight on rapid series of images on slick, glossy magazine pages: each change of image is punctuated by the amplified snap of the page being turned, like a gunshot. we're so close to the images we can't tell when the magazines change from glamour to vogue to us to mademoiselle to w to vanity fair. and it doesn't matter. whether the images are ads or fashion spreads or celebrity candids, the look is the same jaded, hip, disinterested, apathetic, either impossibly buff or anorexic, but always severely beautiful. the page turning starts at a fevered pitch and becomes even more intense. finally }

<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{true. should we stop them?}

<D>__{hey, skip!}
<A>__{skip looks over, then immediately changes course toward them, barely checking the surrounding traffic. he is extraordinarily skillful. when he gets to the curb, he pulls a snazzy board flipping maneuver to dismount and come up on the sidewalk. some of the japanese matrons react with delight.}

<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{lily}

<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{are we?}
<C>__{sheeler}
<P>__{(covering)}

<D>__{i think i've heard of him... a disciple of rothberg, wasn't he?}
<A>__{mumford's response, and all that follow, is calm and pleasant.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{it's possible. i don't know about that.}
<C>__{sheeler}
<D>__{i suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{lots of institutions. my graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible prisons, clinics, half way houses. for a while i was chief therapist in a shopping mall. had a little spot next to the yogurt place.}
<C>__{delbanco}

<C>__{sheeler}
<D>__{i trained in the east, myself cornell and i don't care what anyone says, there really are regional differences. i found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing... did you?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{oh, yeah, very tough. but i guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.}
<C>__{sheeler}
<D>__{which examiner did you have? i probably know him.}

<C>__{sheeler}
<D>__{yes... your particular approach.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{i don't have one really. most of the time i'm faking it. see, i think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep rooted by the time i hear about them. the most i can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. if i can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, i can help them out a little.}
<A>__{mumford sits back, considering the couple across the table. his gaze is so crystalline that, after a moment, they become uncomfortable and steal a glance at each other. finally }

<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{may i?}
<A>__{mumford gestures "of course." sofie swings her legs up and lies on the couch so they can no longer see each other's face. (it's the most vigorous movement she's yet shown us.) this seems to help sofie a bit.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{all right... i'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?}

<D>__{um huh.}

<P>__{(tone still rough)}

<D>__{i'm glad.}
<C>__{sofie}

<P>__{(tentative)}
<D>__{okay...}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{the point is this i am not a blank page. i did not just fall off the turnip truck. do you know what i mean?}

<D>__{i think so.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{i know a little about psychology. i took three different courses in college. it's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but i took them... and there was one concept i remember very well.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{transference!}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{transference.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{yes, and that is what i have got right now. i have taken my feelings of gratitude... and relief... and transferred them onto... you. i have taken all those warm, grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you... so that now i am under the delusion...}

<D>__{...that i am in love with you.}

<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{i think you can understand why i have some serious questions about your methods. i mean, obviously it becomes much more likely that i'm going to have confusion about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up to make outs ville and do all these highly romantic activities }
<A>__{suddenly, sofie's voice cracks. she is starting to cry, but refuses to acknowledge it.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{ we had a paper route together, for godssake! do you understand how i might be a little resentful? knowing that this so called "love" i'm feeling is totally bogus, and just a pathetic case of... transference?}
<A>__{mumford doesn't know what to say. he's on the rack. finally }
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{silence. then sofie gets up, wiping at tears with the back of her bare hand. mumford jumps up to offer her a tissue, but she ignores it. she will not meet his gaze.}
