<L>__{exterior desert town main street continuous}
<A>__{the broad thoroughfare now all that remains of whatever town once stood here. many of the old storefronts still largely intact but patched up with salvaged materials. the asphalt street warped and cracked, parking meters bent and smashed. it's a lot like the abandoned town eli passed through earlier, except very much alive bustling with townsfolk. it's at once a familiar and also a disturbing sight like an old norman rockwell painting of classic small town america, but filtered through the devastating eye of an apocalypse. an unsettling juxtaposition of the old world and the new. the centerpiece of the town is a grand theater at the head of the main street. the palladium. like the rest of the town, badly damaged and shoddily fixed up. but still standing. eli walks down the street and approaches a blacksmith, hammering out a metal plate over an anvil outside his store.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{you got an engineer or a fuelman around here?}
<A>__{the blacksmith doesn't look up from his work but motions toward a storefront at the far end of the street.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{eli heads down the street. stopping when he comes across a statue erected in the center of the road. a tall man crudely fashioned in clay. one hand placed paternally on the head of a small child, the other outstretched toward the sun. as he observes the statue, eli notices that passing residents take a moment to pause and genuflect before it. worshipping. curious, eli reaches up and runs his hand over the statue's face. then hears shuffling feet behind him and turns as a parade of emaciated men and women trudges past. roped together at the waist, each man leading the one behind. heads shaved, thin from malnutrition. and each one blind. they gaze at the ground with pale, dead eyes. they carry picks, shovels and other tools a sightless chain gang. eli watches as the pathetic parade shuffles past, herded like cattle by a brutish chain gang boss who swats at them with a stick to keep them moving and indicate direction.}
<C>__{chain gang boss}
<D>__{come on, move it!}
<A>__{the gang boss glares at eli as he passes by. eli doesn't return the look, just continues crossing the street as the blind are herded away. headed toward a wooden building with a pictogram of a lightning bolt suspended above the door.}
