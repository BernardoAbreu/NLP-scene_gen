<A>__{harry strides down the hall, avoiding their small but incredibly ugly dog, gizmo, who skitters past him going the other way.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{dana, don't forget to feed gizmo!}
<A>__{harry crosses the bedroom, hurrying past helen who is clearly rushing to get ready herself. we get our first good look at helen. she is wearing a terrycloth robe as she picks out an outfit. her hair is wrapped in a towel. to call her plain would be inaccurate. she could be attractive if she put any effort into it, which doesn't occur to her.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i'm late.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{me too.}
<A>__{they talk without looking at each other, the way people who have been together a long time do.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{how'd it go at the trade show? you make all the other salesmen jealous?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah. you should have seen it. we were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount...}
<A>__{she is already tuning him out. and it hits us: she has no}
<B>__{idea what harry really does.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(barely listening)}
<D>__{that's fabulous harry.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah, it was wild.}
<A>__{harry glances at her, oblivious to him and brushing her teeth. he smiles. the best lies are told with enthusiasm.}
