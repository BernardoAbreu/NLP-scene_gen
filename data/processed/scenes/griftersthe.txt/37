<L>__{interior passenger train day}
<A>__{the train runs through a forest, tree shadows making a light and dark pattern. roy, four or five years younger, sits with a three core monte gang, consisting of a dealer, a spectacled shill beside him, roy facing the dealer, a roper next to roy. on a briefcase on the dealer's lap are three cards, face up: an ace and two deuces. across the aisle, alone in the seats, sits mintz, a conman in his fifties, pretending not to watch, but watching with amusement.}
<C>__{dealer}
<D>__{that's between you two. i got nothing at stake here, i'm just dealing.}
<C>__{shill}
<D>__{what if we both guess wrong? you aren't gonna take...}
<A>__{the dealer turns aside, allowing himself to be distracted. he and the shill argue nonsensically. the roper nudges roy, then reaches out and crimps the ace. roy's doing a wide eyed bumpkin kid; he stares at the roper in delight and amazement. an angle on the shill, arguing with the dealer but looking toward roy and the roper, then increasing the force of his argument. an angle across the amused mintz at the roper whispering to roy. two shot, roy and the roper.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{we got him now! put down that big bill you got.}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(whispered)}
<D>__{the fifty or the hundred?}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{the hundred! hurry!}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(doubtful)}
<D>__{the ace is what i want?}
<A>__{the roper's having trouble keeping his patience.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{sure it is!}
<A>__{two shot, the dealer and the shill, fake squabbling, roy and the roper seen in b.g. between their faces, roy finally bringing out his wallet, withdrawing a bill. relieved, the dealer and the shill cut the crap. an angle on the group as roy puts his hundred dollar bill on the briefcase.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{is that okay?}
<A>__{the shill pulls a messy wad of bills from his inner pocket, uses most of it to cover the bet.}
<C>__{shill}
<D>__{you're damn right that's okay.}
<C>__{dealer}
<P>__{(picks up the cards)}
<D>__{whoever finds the ace, wins.}
<A>__{ecu, the dealer's hands, shuffling the cards at lightning speed. he deals the cards out face down.}
