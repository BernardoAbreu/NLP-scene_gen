Bourne's race to the exit is cut off as a 3rd CRI sedan slides into view and it's occupants open fire on Bourne in a head on charge. The just stolen vehicle takes heavy fire as Bourne reacts instantaneously; thumbing on the cruise control, shouldering his door open, and slamming the gas pedal to the floor as he dives out of the car. The agents react as Bourne's sedan torpedoes them head on. Hit hard they're taken out of the fight as metal collapses, glass shatters, and airbags explode. Bourne tumbles to a stop at the rear of a parked car as his car implodes against the oncoming agents. Instantly Bourne is on his feet, moving between the parked cars to engage another CRI sedan traveling parallel to the course of the wrecked one. The agents in this sedan are distracted by the still echoing crash and are caught off-guard as Bourne steps out and points his gun at the driver. The driver ducks and floors his gas pedal in a desperate effort to save his own life. As the sedan suddenly accelerates, Bourne deliberately shifts his aim to the sedan's front tire and fires. The tire explodes and the car suddenly veers left and slams into a parked car, pitching the driver violently against the unyielding interior of the sedan. An instant later Bourne rips the radio off the dazed drivers belt just before he cold cocks him with it. With the wreck still echoing through the garage Bourne has to deal with the arrival of the first NYPD sedan. Bourne takes on the persona of an alarmed witness as the on edge cop climbs out of his car but Bourne's performance is cut short as the agent running from his drop from the roof, arrives and opens fire. The police officer goes down in the hail of gunfire as Bourne turns and expertly drops the gunman with a single shot.
