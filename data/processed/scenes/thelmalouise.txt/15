<L>__{exterior car day}
<A>__{they are driving down the interstate. thelma reaches for her purse and finds the gun.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{louise, will you take care of the gun?}
<A>__{louise shrieks at the sight of it.}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{why in hell did you bring that?}
<A>__{thelma wonders if louise is really that naive.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{oh, come on, louise... psycho killers, bears... snakes! i just don't know how to use it. so will you take care of it?}
<A>__{louise reaches over and takes the gun out of thelma's purse and holds it in her hand. she tests the weight of it, and then puts it under the seat. thelma puts the bullets under the seat. they are speeding off down the highway with the radio blaring. louise puts in a tape of wild r&b music.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{whose place is this again?}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{it's bob's, the day manager's. he's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{i've never had the chance to go out of town without darryl.}
<C>__{louise}

<C>__{louise}
<D>__{aw, shit, thelma, he's gonna kill you.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{well, he has never let me go. he never lets me do one goddamn thing that's any fun. all he wants me to do is hang around the house the whole time while he's out doing god only knows what.}
<A>__{they are both silent for a minute.}
<C>__{thelma}

<D>__{i left him a note. i left him stuff to microwave.}
<A>__{after a pause.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{i guess you haven't heard anything from jimmy... yet?}
<A>__{louise's jaw tightens. the car speeds up.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{...never mind.}
<A>__{a huge semi tanker carrying gas passes them on the highway and honks. the mud flaps are the shiny silhouettes of naked women. there is a bumper sticker on the back that says: "lick you all over ten cents."}
<C>__{louise}
<D>__{one of your friends?}
<A>__{thelma is watching herself in the side mirror, pretending to smoke a cigarette. thelma's pov of a sign alongside the road that reads "see you in church on sunday!" thelma pushes in the lighter and waits for it to pop out. louise gives her a sidelong glance, but does not say anything.}
