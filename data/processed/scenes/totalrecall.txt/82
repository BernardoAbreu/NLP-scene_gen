<L>__{interior last chance air station night}
<A>__{the joint is a combination saloon cathouse casino. there are slot machines, hookers, miners and homesteaders; it is like a nevada brothel packed with wild and woolly indi vidualists, the equivalent of old west trappers, prospectors and cowboys but with a space age look. quail and bennie elbow their way to the bar. fragments of conversation are overheard.}
<D>__{miner #1 ...if that intergalactic little napoleon thinks i'm sellin' and clearin' outta here, he can think again! miner #2}
<P>__{(with a laugh)}
<D>__{...watcha gonna do when he cuts off the air, luke? miner #3 ...you'll be breathin' red dust and shittin' bricks.}
<A>__{bennie and quail pass another group.}
<D>__{miner #4 ...my wife ain't goin' on one of those space shuttles... she hates flyin'... miner #5 ...aw, come on... flyin's safer'n crossin' the road... miner #6 ...yeah, there ain't been a real disaster since that collision off phobos, nigh on twenty years ago... miner #4}
<P>__{(alarmed)}
<D>__{...well, that killed twelve thousand...}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{what is this, bennie... tombstone?}
<C>__{bennie}
<D>__{sorta. bunch of miners out here got their own claims, from way back. cohaagen's buyin' em all up, says he's gonna cut off the air an' water if they won't sell...}
<A>__{quail attracts the attention of the bartender.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{i'm looking for melina noel.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{you've found her.}
<A>__{his nod indicates an area behind quail. he turns to see an attractive waitress placing drinks on tables. she doesn't notice quail. he walks toward her through the crowd. bennie watches, then tactfully slips away. melina turns to return to the bar and runs straight into quail. she stops, obviously astonished to see him.}
<C>__{melina}
<D>__{you bastard!}
<A>__{almost in tears, she pushes her way through the crowd to a billiard room, which is separated from the main bar by swinging doors. there are no occupants and it is almost in darkness. quail, bewildered, follows her. inside the billiard room he turns on the lights which illuminates the area of the table. (note: as quail and melina speak, the activity in the}
<P>__{outside bar can be seen above the swinging doors.)}
<A>__{melina is still fighting back tears. quail stops in front of her, unsure about what to do. he has no recollection of how well he might have known this woman. suddenly, she slaps him hard across the face.}
<C>__{melina}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{you bastard...}
<A>__{he rubs his painful cheek.}
<C>__{melina}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{that's new the innocent look.}
<P>__{(bitter sarcasm)}
<D>__{you didn't have that one before.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{well?}
<A>__{quail is speechless.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{well, uh... i...}
<C>__{melina}
<D>__{all right, i will say it for you.}
<A>__{he looks relieved (but tries to cover).}
<C>__{melina}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{don't worry. i got the note. you discharged your obligation.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{what note?}
<C>__{melina}
<D>__{oh, the usual one. "must return immediately to earth... the wife needs me..."}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{i don't have a wife. well, i do but not a real wife.}
<P>__{(getting desperate)}
<D>__{hell... look... someone else sent that note. someone who }
<C>__{melina}
<D>__{what are you here for?!}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{for you! i don't even know why }
<A>__{melina bursts into tears. quail rather tentatively puts his arms around her. she welcomes this at first, but then pushes him away.}
<C>__{quail}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{whoever i was, i must have been a helluva guy.}
<C>__{melina}
<D>__{"whoever you were"???}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{listen. i've for to tell you something. i beg you to believe me... help me }
<A>__{all melina's suspicions come rushing back.}
<C>__{quail}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{something happened to my mind. memory suppression, false implant, i don't know what }
<A>__{melina backs off. quail grows more desperate.}
<C>__{quail}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{what i'm saying is... i don't remember you. i don't remember us. i don't remember me }
<A>__{melina's expression grows dead hard.}
<C>__{melina}
<D>__{[and i thought...]}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{who is us?}
<C>__{melina}
<P>__{(ignoring the question)}
<D>__{memory erasure is what they use on agents. go away.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{wait... i was an agent i'm not now just tell me who i am! how did we know each other? why are they trying to kill me?!}
<A>__{he takes a step toward her, nearly frantic.}
<C>__{melina}
<D>__{i'm not trusting you again.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{you loved me once, you must have }
<C>__{melina}
<D>__{that you was a liar. who you are now i don't even know.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{please, melina }
<C>__{melina}
<P>__{(tears starting)}
<D>__{get out!}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{i need your help }
