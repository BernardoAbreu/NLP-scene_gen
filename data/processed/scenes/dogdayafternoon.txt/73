<L>__{interior bank night}
<A>__{sonny comes back into bank, his face mad with pain. he walks over to sylvia, standing at open gate of tellers' cages, and brings out a wallet with pictures for her to see. she takes it, smiles.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{my kids... kimmy and jimmy.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{they're beautiful...}
<A>__{she looks over toward mulvaney, now behind the tellers' cages, trying to tidy up, and walks over to show him the pictures. sonny stands on the other side of the cages.}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(as mulvaney looks at pictures)}
<D>__{i will never see them again, mister mulvaney.}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{they look like good kids.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{they're like any others but they're special to me. you got kids? you told me; you got two.}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{special to me, too.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{you like me?}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{sure we like you.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{no you don't.}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{you seem like a likable enough guy. it's hard to judge.}
<A>__{sonny walks back toward sal, who is seated in conference room.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{hey, sal... how you doin'?}
<C>__{sal}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{sonny crosses back downstage again to mulvaney and sylvia.}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(referring to sal)}
<D>__{you know, i don't know him very well but he's not gay... and he's not going back to prison... one time when he was in prison, they gang banged him; 13 years old and eight guys gave it to him... so sal isn't goin' back to prison, no way.}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{you know... i like you people... i really do.}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{we like you, too.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{you know i had a job once. i used to work in a bank. i had been training... i used to have a boss... mr. don frio... he wore a toupee... i wonder if you'd hire me if i came in here and asked you for a job...}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{would i hire you?}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<A>__{sonny walks back toward sal.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{i told you they're sending a jet. it's all worked out...}
<A>__{but doubt hangs in the air like a pall... closeup sal looking at him. implacable. this tension between them over the question of sonny's loyalty must be kept constantly alive with cuts and looks, over dialogue... sylvia & mulvaney}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{somebody give me another cigarette.}
<A>__{sal turns to look at her reproachfully.}
<B>__{on sylvia}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{i wish somebody would tell me i'm gonna live long enough for it to be a habit. my parent, she'll be okay. my husband, he'll be okay. i even know who the bum is gonna marry. terrific. she'll take good care of him.}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{girls, i wanta apologize. for my language back there.}
<A>__{embarrassed, he walks toward the rest of group in the rear, stands by edna's desk.}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{ladies... i want to apologize for my language back there.}
<P>__{(he walks over to his desk, sits down)}
<A>__{sonny exits conference room and moves downstage.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<P>__{(amazed)}
<D>__{what'd you say? i didn't hear you say anything.}
<A>__{they think for a moment.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{he said the 'f' word.}
<A>__{they stare at her incredulously. someone giggles.}
<C>__{edna}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{the 'f' word. he did. he said the 'f' word.}
<A>__{edna crosses to her desk disgusted and starts to tidy up. the giggle catches the edge of their panic and anxiety and sweeps them into uncontrollable giggles and laughter: sonny roars. sal and edna alone remain unsmiling. after a few seconds they force themselves to stop, to behave like they should under the circumstances. they are gasping and crying. then...}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{what's so funny?}
<C>__{edna}
<D>__{well, i'm a christian, and my ears are not garbage cans.}
<A>__{it sets them off again. they howl and giggle and laugh. until at last they run down again. at this point, sal rushes out of conference room.}
<C>__{sal}
<D>__{who's that?}
<A>__{he has seen something in the middle of the street, and now...}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{as they all turn to look out through the door.}
<B>__{their pov}
<A>__{backlighted by the floodlights in the middle of street escorted by sheldon, stands a figure, dumpy and gray, tentatively waving, a figure that bends over baby carriages in the park, picks beans one by one out of supermarket bins, lip reads get well cards in pharmacies. they hear sheldon, outside, on bullhorn:}
<C>__{sheldon }
<D>__{sonny! could you come out, please? could you come out, please?}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{it's my mother. who needs this shit?}
<A>__{but as a dutiful son he starts for the front of the bank.}
