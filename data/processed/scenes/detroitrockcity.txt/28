<L>__{exterior st. bernard's day}
<A>__{the car winds up the path leading to a dark, gothic edifice over which tumultuous storm clouds continuously hover. thunder belches and bolts of lightning shoot at the blackened crucifixes along the structure. we hear a scary organ theme.}
<L>__{interior voc tech dept. day}
<A>__{except for the tinkering noises that are heard as the students work on their projects, there is silence in electronics class. the teacher, mr. johansen, sips from a coffee cup and reads a newspaper, his feet on the desk. the headline says: "mass suicide in jonestown. cyanide in the kool aid." above him is a long banner reading: "sorry, absolutely no bathroom breaks". hawk, trip, and lex sit before a half built radio on a work bench, sheer desperation etched on their faces. lex solders two copper wires together. hawk attaches a dial. trip absently plays with a squeeze pump attached to a long plastic tube. he blows air into his face repeatedly with it.}
<C>__{trip}
<P>__{(re:squeeze pump tube)}
<D>__{wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.}
<A>__{hawk turns the radio on and a high frequency whine pours from its speaker. he adjusts the volume, then the tuner, until a dj's voice comes through crisp and clear.}
<C>__{dj's voice}
<D>__{...and this is simple simon on the rock of detroit, w.a.r.p., home of the biggest kiss giveaway in the history of the universe!}
<A>__{detroit? detroit? hawk, trip, and lex react like they've just been hit by phasers on stun. god is intervening.}
<C>__{dj's voice}
<D>__{i got four, count 'em, four front row tickets along with four backstage passes to the concert tonight at cobo hall and i'm giving them to the 106th caller who can tell me the real names of each kiss band member!}
<A>__{high frequency noises again, then the radio loses reception. hawk exchanges an anxious glance with trip and lex.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{too bad we're stuck in electronics or...}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{never mind with the too bad shit. i got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.}
