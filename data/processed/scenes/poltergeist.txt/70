<B>__{full shot}
<A>__{with the exception of the two beds blocking the closet, robbie and carol anne’s room is stripped clean. diane lets out a muffled shriek and throws herself against the barricade, pulling back mattresses, boxsprings and blankets. steve joins her and together they work side by side, panting, crying and calling for carol anne. angle robbie still in a state of complete dislocation, robbie walks back into his bedroom and looks at the window. the tree is there no longer. e. buzz, the dog, joins robbie, whimpering at his feet. angle the closet over diane, screaming out carol anne’s name, steve does the muscle work, pulling off end tables, lone ranger lamps, chest of drawers, toys and stuffed animals, working his way to the bottom of this innocent debris. camera starts to move in. going beyond steve to his hands at work as he lifts the last layer of mayhem off carol anne’s favorite pink blanket. there is a folded lump beneath it. the lump doesn’t stir. diane covers her mouth and hyperventilates as steve gently removes the fuzzy blanket and... it is the clown doll, smiling up at them outrageously.}
