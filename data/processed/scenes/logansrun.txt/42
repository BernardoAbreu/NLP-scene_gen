<L>__{interior wall dazzle chamber}
<A>__{a room of angled, reflecting surfaces. at one end a jagged corridor, also mirrored, leads away. the zigzag, angled effect creates an absolute confusion of images. but logan leads her unhesitatingly across the chamber to the corridor. jessica hangs back, momentarily certain she's about to smash into something.}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(guiding her)}
<D>__{just follow no matter how it seems...}
<C>__{jessica}
<P>__{(doing her best)}
<D>__{but what is this why?}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(as they enter the corridor)}
<D>__{the cubs. when they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. without the dazzle, they'd just go past us }
<P>__{(gesture)}
<D>__{too fast}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{muscle? i don't know that one.}
<A>__{logan is leading her down the zigzag corridor. it's stop and go a fun house in which you can get hurt.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{it's unauthorized. no good for any one over thirteen anyhow shakes you to pieces speeds everything up to a blur }
<P>__{(he is amused)}
<D>__{you can see what happens when some flying cub tries to go through this on muscle splat!}
<A>__{jessica reacts...to what logan has said...then: a moment later:}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{as they approach the end of the corridor, a small figure in a tattered garment approaches them. she stops singing as she sees logan and jessica.}
<C>__{jessica}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{don't be afraid.}
<A>__{we see that it is a little girl of seven. her face is grimy and hair is tangled.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i'm mary 2.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{where do you live, mary?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{here.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{why aren't you in nursery?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i'm very smart.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{when do you go up?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i never go upstairs. you're a nice old lady.}
<A>__{as soon as she finishes her last sentence, mary grabs at jessica's clothing...tearing a pin (piece of jewelry) off...and running away swiftly. as jessica instinctively starts after her...logan... holds her back.}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{not here. might be a decoy.}
<A>__{cautiously, logan and jessica exit from the wall, stepping out into }
