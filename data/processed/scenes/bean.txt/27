<A>__{bean enters. he's been here for years and made it his own. it's an odd little world. there's a framed picture of shirley bassey on his desk and airfix planes hang from the ceiling. also a large cosy armchair and a t.v. a pleasant man in a suit, around 40, breezes in.}

<D>__{ah bean, i'm looking for a painting by van hocht. still life. circa 1670. can do?}
<A>__{bean nods. this is what bean likes to do best. the camera follows as he turns sees the extraordinary sight behind him... his office is just a tiny corner of a massive storage room, hundreds of feet high and long, the walls completely full of rack after rack of stored paintings. at the end of the room, we can see hundreds of sculptures: busts, modern abstracts, men on horses, classical maidens, rodins, the lot. it's like the giant storehouse at the end of 'raiders of the lost ark. bean sets off into it in his own eccentric way. he knows exactly where heels going. he climbs a ladder, like you find in a library then pushes himself off, and whizzes the entire length of the room on slippery wooden runners. he has now reached the sculpture area, but the painting heels looking for is on the other side. he crosses the room by using the sculptures as a kind of artistic obstacle course. in front of him is the burghers of calais, a rodin statue of 5 prisoners in chains. he simply walks across their 5 heads, like stones in a stream. he then comes to an abstract modern piece, which he uses as a slide and at the end of which, he crawls through the hole in the next modern thing. he then begins to climb up various famous ancient statues, using the mouths as footholes, breasts as support, codpieces as steps and empty eyes as finger holes. after a problem getting his. foot caught in the jaw of a sculptured dog, he walks flat along a modern sculpture, then uses a sequence of classic sculptures as stairs on the head of a little degas ballerina, one step on to the bottom of a horse, two steps onto the head of the person riding the horse, three steps and now he's on the other side of the hall. he then triumphantly pulls out a painting. it's the one!,}
