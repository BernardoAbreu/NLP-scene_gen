<L>__{interior hospital room day}
<A>__{flash! scottie takes elizabeth's picture again.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i wish you'd stop doing that. and rather than taking her picture all the time, you should talk to her. i'm tired of asking you. you heard dr. johnston people in a coma can hear you you know, well, some of them can. it lets them know they're still loved, might even help them wake up sooner. and it'll help you express whatever feelings and emotions you're supposed to be going through you know, make you feel better.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{i don't know what to say.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{tell her a story.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{i don't have a story.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{tell her anything. tell her what's been going on in school.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{she never cares about that.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i don't believe that. what about after school? she's always driving you around the island. you know, gymnastics? soccer?}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{i don't do those things anymore.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{ballet? piano? hula?}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{nope.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{if you're not going to say anything to your mother, we might as well leave.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{okay. let's go.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{how about this? write her a letter.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{what would i write?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i don't know. "get well. wake up. i love you. don't leave me alone with my idiot dad."}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{how's she going to read it? she's in a coma.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{goddammit, scottie, stop fighting me on everything.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{but it doesn't make any sense.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you know what your mother is hearing right now? you refusing to talk to her. is that what you want?}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{i'm starving. and i'm thirsty. i want a soda.}
<A>__{he takes scottie by the hand and sits her down in a chair next to the bed.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{we're not leaving until you talk to her. i will even give you privacy. recite her the alphabet for all i care. what do you want to drink?}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{sprite.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{ok, sprite. diet sprite?}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{not diet. regular. do you think i'm fat?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{no, you're not fat.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{i'm not the model.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{it's just that all that sugar makes you cranky.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{i'm not cranky!}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{okay. i will be right back. talk.}
