<L>__{exterior pig slaughterhouse day.}
<A>__{pigs are crying in the chute as paul, stamp paid and twenty other workers push and prod them towards the slaughterhouse. although steeped in pig shit on a wintry day his hands numb from the cold paul d. is in high spirits. he sings as he works much to the amusement of his fellow co workers.}
<D>__{co worker 1 hey you like this work so much maybe you best get in the chute with the others. you ain't got much more sense than they do.}
<A>__{the men laugh. paul smiles and brushes it off.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{ain't just a job reason to sing. other things a man's got to look forward to that a job just a way to spend your day til the good times arrive. co worker 2 good times? ain't no such day.}
<C>__{stamp paid}
<D>__{now, now...it's all a state a mind, right paul d. if you can think it, it can happen.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{more than that. when a man can make plans then a man can make good times happen. co worker 1 oh the man's got plans! you saving up for a gold mine, boy.}
<P>__{(more laughter)}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{better then gold, my friend. me and my woman's planning on starting a family.}
<A>__{stamp paid's face registers sudden concern.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{new life. born free, hear! now if that don't define a good tine, i don't know what does. co worker 2 nothing born free ever again.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what you talkin? nobody owns us no more. nobody gonna own my children neither. co worker 2 children inherit what come before'em. just cause you can't see no chains, don't mean they not there. we're not free men. we're somewhere between freedom and chains. and as long as the world is white, that's where we're stayin.}
<A>__{the truth of this causes the men to be silent as they continue working. stamp paid looks at paul, confused by what he should do.}
