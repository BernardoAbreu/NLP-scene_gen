<D>__{at 11:15, if the church is still in peril, give the order to evacuate the cardinals. but with dignity, let them exit into st. peter's square, with their heads held high. i don't want the last image of this church to be frightened old men sneaking out a back door. if cardinal mortati protests, escort him bodily. do you understand?}
