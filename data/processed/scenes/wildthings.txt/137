<D>__{i think i looked away. a split second. then, bingo. just like that. she puts a knee into my groin.}

<D>__{there was this coffee table between us and the wall. she got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case. thing had a glass door. i could hear it breaking.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i didn't go down, but she slowed me up, just enough. before i could get to her, she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun. i yelled at her to put it down. she got off a shot. i took it in the shoulder. i... i had no choice. i returned fire. two rounds, i think. in the chest.}
