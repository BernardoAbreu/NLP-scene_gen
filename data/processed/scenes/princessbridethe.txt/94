<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{the man in black}
<A>__{stunned, doing everything be can to keep inigo by the cliff edge. but no use. slowly at first, he begins to retreat. now faster, inigo is in control and the man in black is desperate.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{inigo}
<A>__{and the six fingered sword is all but invisible now, as he increases his attack, then suddenly switches styles again.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{a rocky staircase leading to a turret shaped plateau, and the man in black is retreating like mad up the steps and he can't stop inigo nothing can stop inigo and in a frenzy, the man in black makes every feint, tries every thrust, lets go with all he has left. but he fails. everything fails. he tries one or two final desperate moves but they are nothing.}
<C>__{man in black}
<D>__{you're amazing!}
<C>__{inigo}
<D>__{i ought to be after twenty years.}
<A>__{and now the man in black is smashed into a stone pillar, pinned there under the six fingered sword.}
<C>__{man in black}
<P>__{(hollering it out)}
<D>__{there's something i ought to tell you.}
<C>__{inigo}
<D>__{tell me.}
<C>__{man in black}
<D>__{i am not left handed either.}
<A>__{and now he changes hands, and at last, the battle is fully joined.}
