<A>__{newt is in a low grottolike chamber, filled with pipes and machines. it is flooded, almost up to newt's waist. she looks up, seeing light streaming through a grating. ripley's voice seems to come from there.}

<A>__{hicks joins ripley, unsnapping the emergency locator from his belt. they follow the signal into a lighted area where the power apparently was not cut.}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{this way. we're close...}
<A>__{following the signal they come to a grating set in the floor.}
<C>__{newt}
<D>__{here! i'm here. i'm here.}
<A>__{ripley runs to the grating. looking down she sees newt's tearstreaked face. newt reaches up. her tiny fingers wriggle up through the bars of the grate. ripley squeezes the child's precious fingertips.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{climb down, honey. we have to cut through this grate.}
<A>__{newt backs away, climbing down the pipe as hicks cuts into the bars with his hand torch.}
