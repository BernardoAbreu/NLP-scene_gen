<A>__{later. a drunken vinovich is holding court. he's in his}
<L>__{40's: a flamboyant and loquacious man with a heavy (and}
<A>__{fake) middle european accent. at the table besides harry and walter are: vinovich's starlet nymphet girlfriend laura; an asian american illusionist called billy who; and two of vinovich's adoring courtiers, an overblown, overdressed female illusionist debra devine and a thin, waspish fellow in a spangly suit: the amazing quentin. in the conversation that follows we go back to harry repeatedly as he studies this extraordinary group.}
<C>__{vinovich}
<D>__{it's more than entertainment. we're opening people's heads up. putting miracles back into their boring little lives.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{but they're fake miracles.}
<C>__{vinovich}
<D>__{houdini believed he had spirit guides.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you believe that?}
<C>__{vinovich}
<D>__{i think we walk a narrow path, between... between...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{heaven and hell?}
<A>__{vinovich stares hard at harry, trying to figure out whether he's being sarcastic or not.}
<C>__{vinovich}
<D>__{trickery and divinity.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?}
<C>__{vinovich}
<D>__{no. i'm saying they were always fake. the saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{so could you walk on water?}
<C>__{vinovich}
<P>__{(deadly serious)}
<D>__{i could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what about swann's miracles?}
<A>__{the smug smile on vinovich's face dies. furtive glances are exchanged around the table. only billy who makes a tiny smile.}
<C>__{vinovich}
<D>__{they weren't worth a damn.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(goading)}
<D>__{i heard he was the best.}
<C>__{vinovich}
<D>__{if he was so good why's he so dead?}
<A>__{vinovich begins to look suspicious.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you tell me. no? i thought you'd maybe have a theory.}
<C>__{vinovich}
<D>__{oh, i've got plenty.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i'd like to hear them.}
<A>__{vinovich rises.}
<C>__{vinovich}
<D>__{i'm not saying another word.}
<P>__{(to wilder)}
<D>__{you damn fool. he's a journalist.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{just tell me about swann. or are you too scared?}
<C>__{vinovich}
<D>__{he was a freak. everything he did was tainted.}
<A>__{harry rises. looks straight at vinovich, unintimidated.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{with what?}
<C>__{vinovich}
<D>__{evil. he was evil.}
<P>__{(to laura)}
<D>__{come on.}
<A>__{she rises.}
<C>__{vinovich}
<P>__{(to the rest)}
<D>__{say nothing to this man if you wish to keep my company.}
<A>__{he stalks away. harry calls after him, across a now silenced bar.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{great accent, by the way. is it brooklyn?}
<C>__{vinovich}
<P>__{(pure brooklyn)}
<D>__{fuck you.}
