<L>__{exterior hampstead heath day}
<A>__{cut to the wide sweep of hampstead heath. william entirely alone. he marches up a hill... goes over the crest of it and sees a huge film crew and hundreds of extras in front of the radiant white of kenwood house, with its lawn and its lakes.}
<L>__{exterior kenwood house day}
<A>__{now closer to the house, william approaches a barrier where he is himself approached.}
<C>__{security}
<D>__{can i help you?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{yes i was looking for anna scott...}
<C>__{security}
<D>__{does she know you're coming?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{no, no. she doesn't.}
<C>__{security}
<D>__{i'm afraid i can't really let you through then, sir.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{oh right. i mean, i am a friend i'm not a lunatic but no, you basically...}
<C>__{security}
<D>__{... can't let you through.}
<A>__{at that moment thirty yards away, william sees trailer door open. out of it comes anna looking extraordinary in a velvet dress; full, beautiful make up; rich, extravagant hair. she has a necessary cluster of people about her. hair, make up, costume and the third assistant who has collected her. she walks a few yards, and then casually turns her head. and sees him. her face registers not jut surprise, certainly not a simple smile. his being there is a complicated thing. cut back to him. he does a small wave. she pauses as the whole paraphernalia of the upcoming scene passes between them. the movie divides them. but then she begins to walk through it, and followed by her cluster, she makes her way towards him. when she reaches him, the security guard stands back a pace, and her people hold back. she doesn't really know what to say...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{this is certainly... ah...}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i only found out you were here yesterday.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i was going to ring... but... i didn't think you'd want to...}
<A>__{the third assistant is under pressure.}
<C>__{third}
<D>__{anna.}
<A>__{she looks around. the poor third is nervous and the first is approaching.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(to william)}
<D>__{it's not going very well and it's our last day.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{absolutely you're clearly very busy.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{but... wait... there are things to say.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{drink tea there's lots of tea.}
<A>__{she is swept away, four people touching her hair and costume.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{come and have a look...}
