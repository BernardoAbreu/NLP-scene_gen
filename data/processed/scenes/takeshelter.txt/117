<L>__{interior storm shelter later}
<A>__{a crack of thunder rattles the shelter. curtis snaps awake, still wearing his gas mask. samantha has climbed on the other cot and is asleep. hannah sleeps under curtis' arm. he gently lays her down on the cot and stands to stretch. he walks into the original section of the shelter and grabs a small flashlight off the metal shelving. he clicks it on and moves over to the concrete steps. he takes a seat and listens. he places his hand onto the metal door. a boom of thunder. he can hear the rain and wind blowing outside.}
