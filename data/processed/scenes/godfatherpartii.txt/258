<L>__{exterior tahoe estate day}
<A>__{it is late fall most of the leaves have fallen on the grounds and there is quite a wind.}
<B>__{med. view}
<A>__{the water is whipped up by the wind, and the waves are high as they break against the pavilion. we hear the music of time passing, of michael, of the godfather over these images.}
<B>__{view on the swimming pools}
<A>__{they have not been used in several months; they are drained and the bottoms are mossy and dark.}
<B>__{view on the main gate}
<A>__{leaves blowing past it; we don't see the button men; only a hint of someone in the gatehouse.}
<B>__{view on the houses}
<A>__{some of the houses have had the summer awnings taken down, and put away. some of the windows have been boarded up.}
<B>__{view on the kennels}
<A>__{there are still the guard dogs; some sleeping, some moving impatiently. as the music concludes its statement.}
<B>__{med. view}
<A>__{the peninsula of the private corleone harbor. we see the figures of two people, seated at a table.}
<B>__{med. view}
<A>__{michael sits at a table having a sparse lunch. he is attended by his sister connie, who seems to be the closest person now living on the estate with him. we see from the way she pampers him with his lunch, that she has fallen into the role of a surrogate mother wife. he seems older than his years, as though his illness, diabetes, has taken its toll.}
<C>__{connie}
<D>__{don't worry; i'm sure he got here on time. the roads from the airport are so windy, it takes forever; i've driven them myself.}
<A>__{she picks up some of the serving plates that he has left untouched.}
<C>__{connie}
<D>__{i will bring him out to you as soon as he comes.}
<A>__{she moves back to the main house.}
<B>__{med. close view on michael}
<A>__{he turns and looks at the rough water of the lake for a moment. he slowly takes a sip of wine.}
