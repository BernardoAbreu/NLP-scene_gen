<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{how does winston find him if a.t.f. and all the local police can't?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{people talk to winston. he's street, same as them, they trust him. they get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. i thought i might drop in on him. he'll no doubt be surprised to see me.}

<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{ray wants him.}

<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{that's why a.t.f.'s gotta make the case. i'm their witness. they wouldn't have a case without me. if it's his word against mine, who are they gonna believe?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{it's not that simple.}
<A>__{phone in one hand, smoke in the other, jackie begins pacing back and forth.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{it never was, so i'm not gonna start worrying about it now. look, ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. all he really gives a shit about is getting ordell.}
