<L>__{interior mars one hab. day}
<A>__{mcconnell, terri, and phil follow luke into the science lab area of the hab, then stop in their tracks. their helmets are off. it's very cold in here; their breath is frosty. their pov the lab is crammed with rock and sand samples from many locations, all tagged and labelled. there are drawings and diagrams covering the walls: martian landscapes, annotated maps, and over and over, obsessively repeated, drawings of the vortex that destroyed the mars one crew.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{see, where they made their mistake was, they must've planned for it to be visible from earth...}
<A>__{the others turn, looking at him. luke is aiming an electric space heater at his computer. as the coils glow red, he rubs his hands together, poised over the keyboard.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{who's "they"?}
<A>__{luke reacts to their blank stares. he has a kind of jittery feverish intensity, a secret excitement.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{don't you understand? hundreds of millions of years have gone by. you've got erosion, sand storms, lava flows, meteor impacts hell, in that much time, the whole surface would've changed. so no wonder we never saw it before. well, i mean, we saw it, but not like they meant us too. too much dirt on it.}
<A>__{the others exchange worried glances. is he totally nuts?}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{saw what?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{this.}
<A>__{on the computer screen they're looking at...}
<B>__{close on the monitor}
<A>__{pictures of the face after the disaster, seen from ground level, in telephoto views. rising out of a ring of rock and dirt rubble is the shiny white profile of a gigantic face. the white is smooth, impenetrable. it has the scale of a mountain, but the planes and angles are clearly unnatural. mcconnell, phil and terri (interior mars one hab.) they are stunned. can hardly believe their eyes.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{jesus...}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{what is that...?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i don't know. but whatever it is, somebody built it. and not us.}
<A>__{a few moments of silence while they try to absorb this.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{what about the sound? that signal you heard before the explosion?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{good, jim, good. that's the key.}
<A>__{a click of the mouse and they all hear, over speakers, the}
<B>__{deep pulsing bass tone.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{hear the pauses? that's what made me realize it's a pattern a repeating pattern.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{mathematical?}
<A>__{luke is trembling with excitement. his words tumble out very quickly. he's been waiting so long to share this.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{that's what i thought. there are distinct blocks in the pattern, and within each block the tones come in groups of three. threethreethree. for months i struggled to analyze it, trying different constructs... then i thought about dimensions.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{x y z coordinates...}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{right! three groups equals three dimensions... so i tried assigning different graphic values to each block, group and tone. and finally i got... this.}
<A>__{he types another command. they all look at the monitor, the glow reflecting on their faces. they are amazed again.}
<B>__{close on the monitor}
<A>__{where we see the beautiful interlocking chain, the universally familiar double helix, of a dna molecule the elegant blueprint of life. back to scene (interior mars one hab.)}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{my god... is that what i think it is?}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{dna... that's a model of dna!}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you see it, too. thank god. i was afraid i was just suffering from a form of asphyxia.}
<A>__{she glances at him, surprised that he overheard her earlier diagnosis. but he smiles, not offended.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{so, okay, so somebody left this thing here, somebody other than human. but what the hell is it?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{my guess is, it's a signature. a self portrait of whatever species created the face.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{but that dna looks human.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{no way. it's missing the last pair of chromosomes. see?}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{yeah, but it's close. damn close.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{the difference between a man and an ape is less than three percent of genetic material. but that three percent gives you mozart. einstein.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{or jack the ripper.}
<A>__{they look at him. then all four turn, stare again at the slowly rotating dna, pondering its awesome mystery.}
<B>__{mcconnell}
<A>__{when he finally speaks, never takes his eyes off the screen. we can read in them the almost overwhelming grip this mystery has on his imagination.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{it's been a long day. let's get a couple hours sleep, then tackle this thing when we're fresher. phil, your first priority will be to get the motherboards over to the erv. concentrate on getting communications up first.}
<P>__{(phil nods)}
<D>__{soon as we've got the juice, we'll send a packet to micker, tell them luke's ok, and that... everything else that's happened. the rest of us will take an inventory of supplies, see where we stand. okay?}
<A>__{the others nod in weary agreement. as they start out, towards the relative warmth of the greenhouse, terri looks at luke, at his scraggly beard and his long, lank hair. she smiles, brushing some locks off his forehead.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{c'mon. there's a pair of scissors in my medkit.}
<A>__{sequence from original script.}
