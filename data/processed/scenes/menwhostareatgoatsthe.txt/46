<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{the new earth army was tasked with preventing conflict. we're a force of peace, not war. bill realized if you want to change the world, you've got to start by changing the armies. he was the one that started the research into non lethals.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{non lethals?}
<A>__{lyn flicks away his cigarette.}
<C>__{lyn cassady}

<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{you see? you're mine now. the predator is completely biodegradable. it's friendly to the earth but it can hurt you in a hundred ways.}

<C>__{bob}
<D>__{stop it! stop hurting me!}
<A>__{lyn stares at the blob fondly.}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
