<A>__{opening credits. it's early friday morning and the sun peeks over the la skyline. as the city starts to awake and the credits continue to roll; we see several shots of the real people who make up los angeles. it seems that they all move to the same beat.}
<L>__{exterior l.a. county jail continuous}
<A>__{debo is released from the twin towers county jail. still in his orange jumpsuit, he walks right past us and down the street. everybody clears his path. soundtrack still pumpin'. debo crosses the street passing an old man dancing and directing traffic. debo stops, the man starts to dance in front of him. he stares for a second, then he's on his way. still walking tall and hard, he trips over a crack in the sidewalk (losing cool points). three little black girls in plaid uniforms practice the latest dance steps on their way to school. debo is walking towards them. they scream and take off in the other direction. he smiles. briefly. still walking; he stops at a corner. a sa boy waits to cross with his low rider bike. a metrolink train passes. after it goes by; we see debo riding off on the boy's bike. he's on the ground holding his eye. debo continues to ride through the city. he turns a corner or two and comes to a stop at craig's house.}
