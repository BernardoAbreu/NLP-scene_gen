<A>__{the interior of adam's house is spotless. pictures on the walls: adam and his dad sailing. adam and his parents at his bar mitzvah. adam and his best friend, seth, at high school graduation. a university of berkeley hat. a national academic achievement award in the sciences. curled in a fetal position, adam sleeps peacefully next to rachel (25), his loving girlfriend. cute, charming, and artsy, rachel is "winnie cooper" all grown up. the sound of the waves crashing stops abruptly. a loud obnoxious alarm clock goes off. startled, adam jumps up. drenched in sweat, and completely disoriented, he looks around in confusion. after a moment, adam pulls an earplug out of each ear, and turns off the alarm. the sound of the crashing waves turns back on. adam pushes a button on the alarm clock and the sound of the waves stops, but the loud obnoxious alarm returns. he pushes the clock again. the alarm turns off but now we hear the sound of crickets chirping. again adam pushes a button, this time we hear the sound of a loud thunder rain storm, he pushes a button again, this time we hear the sound of loud clanging church bells. rachel rolls over }
