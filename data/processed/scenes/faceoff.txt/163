<L>__{exterior beach day}
<A>__{archer and castor lie dazed... then stir. castor sees the pistol lying half buried... he reaches for it. but archer gets it first. he aims it at castor as they rise.}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{you won't shoot me, jon. i'm unarmed...}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{okay, i have a confession to make... but you aren't gonna like it... you're right, i won't shoot you. not in the face anyway.}
<A>__{boom archer shoots castor in the chest! he jerks and reels dropping to his knees. he looks at archer in total disbelief. then he sinks to the ground and lies still. exhausted, archer lets the empty gun drop. then he turns and sees an fbi chopper heading his way. relieved, he turns back to castor, but castor's body is gone! castor is crawling toward the flipped boat's spinning stabilizing screw. archer fires hitting castor in the leg. he buckles... but keeps going. archer leaps on him they struggle as castor tries to bury his face on the spinning blade.}
<C>__{castor}
<D>__{it'll never be over, jon... every time you look in the mirror... you'll see my face...}
<A>__{they struggle as the propeller blade. gets closer, closer slicing into "archer's" cheek. at the last instant... archer reaches the anchor chain. he wraps it around the screw stopping the whirling blades. castor finally sinks to the ground and no longer moves. archer takes castor's hand trying to tug off his wedding ring. just when he almost has it off castor suddenly grabs archer's wrist and holds it tight. eye contact between the two men. castor smirks, his grasp slackening... as he finally fades away. archer lets castor's hand drop, then slides the ring on his own finger.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{the chopper lands. buzz and wanda rush over.}
