<L>__{exterior desert rhonda's truck day}
<A>__{val looks out hopefully. the dust clears. he sees her rhonda lebeck, (25). val's eyes do an expert vertical scan: short brown hair, small brown eyes, so so chest, legs hidden in baggy dungarees. laden with a portable computer, notebooks, and some seismograph printouts, she stares at him through tilted glasses. her little pick up truck is loaded with geology field equipment. she shakes val's hand firmly.}

<P>__{(brightly)}
<D>__{hi, i'm rhonda. rhonda lebeck. i'm up here for the semester...}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{yeah, geography.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{right, geology. and you have to be val and earl. i've heard all about you.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{we deny everything.}
<A>__{rhonda smiles.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{listen, got a question for you. do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{around here? why would they?}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{well, i'm supposed monitor these seismographs. you know, they measure vibrations...}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{yeah, vibrations in the ground.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{yeah, well, i'm getting what i refer to scientifically as "weird vibes." every sensor i've got is giving me strange readings. i mean, the school has had these machines up here three years and they've never recorded anything like this.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{well, we'll ask around. let you know if we hear of anything.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{thanks. god, i hope they're not screwed up. i might have to bag the whole semester. anyway, sorry to bother you.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{no problem. nice meeting you. hope you get it sorted out.}
<A>__{rhonda unhappily turns back to her equipment as val and earl drive off.}
