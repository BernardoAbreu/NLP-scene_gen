<L>__{interior sophie's house upstairs room night}
<A>__{a small room exquisitely decorated in pale lilac tapestry. the lights are very dim, and dennis, who we cannot see, is lying on the floor. dennis' clothes are draped over a chair. chance sees a very small pocket television on a desk. he turns the tv on.}
<C>__{dennis' voice}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{can you see well?}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(squints at small screen)}
<D>__{yes, very well, thank you.}
<C>__{dennis' voice}
<D>__{do you like it?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes. it's very tiny, but it's good.}
<C>__{dennis' voice}
<P>__{(disappointed at it being 'tiny')}
<D>__{... are you sure you like it?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes, i do, it's very good.}
<C>__{dennis' voice}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{really? really!!!}
<A>__{chance reacts to the change in tone of dennis' voice, turns to look at him on the floor. hearing the groans and heavy breathing, chance thinks dennis is ill.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{do you need a doctor? i could call robert...}
<C>__{dennis' voice}
<D>__{i don't want robert.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{i see.}
<C>__{dennis' voice}
<P>__{(through the groans)}
<D>__{your foot! give me your foot!!}
<A>__{dennis reaches out with his free hand, grabs chance's foot, pulls it to himself.}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(some pain)}
<D>__{thank you. but my leg is still a little sore.}
<A>__{chance watches as dennis goes through some spasms, then his body relaxes. chance is concerned for dennis' health.}
<C>__{chance }
<D>__{are you sure you're not ill?}
<A>__{we hear a contented sigh from the man on the floor.}
