<A>__{a mixture of modest houses and apartment buildings. mr. brooks's toyota is parked in the semi dark cast by a tree. we rise over the car, over the trees, over the houses to the other side of the block and come down to find mr. brooks working the lock on the side door of a small bungalow. he has on surgical gloves. the pick is extracted, the handle turned. the door opens. there's a chain. mr. brooks removes a pair of bent rubber tipped forceps from a pocket, inserts it in the chain, pulls the door to, gives the tool a twist and gently pushes the door inward. the chain has been released.}
