<D>__{hey, she doesn't want to go with you. come on.}
<A>__{the star man frees his right hand and blindly searches the floor for the gun. he comes up with it and, shoving the barrel in the man's face, barks a harsh command in his language. the man freezes and jenny stops struggling. it's suddenly very quiet on the street.}

<D>__{oh god, man... don't shoot me... my mistake... i'm sorry...}

<D>__{i'm leaving now... i won't say a word...}
<A>__{he keeps his eyes on the star man until he reaches the back of the mustang, steals a quick look at the license plate, then blots for his van. the star man takes his hand off jenny's mouth and slams her back into her seat. uttering an expletive in his language he points the gun in her face and keeping it there indicates the red dot on the satel compass floating undisturbed above the dashboard.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{go.}
