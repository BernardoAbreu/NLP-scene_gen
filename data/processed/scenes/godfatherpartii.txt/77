<D>__{what took so long?}
<C>__{clemenza}
<P>__{(sicilian)}
<D>__{she couldn't decide.}

<B>__{moving view}
<A>__{vito drives the truck through the downtown streets; he turns a corner and stops for a light. suddenly, to his left, he sees the formidable figure of fanucci. he grabs young corleone by the shoulder.}
<B>__{close view on fanucci}
<A>__{frightening, revealing the large circular scar, now healed.}
<C>__{fanucci}
<P>__{(sicilian)}
<D>__{ahhh, young fellow. people tell me you're rich, you and your two friends. yet, you don't show enough respect to send a few dresses to my home. you know i have three daughters.}
<A>__{vito says nothing. fanucci thumbs through the stock.}
<C>__{fanucci}
<P>__{(sicilian)}
<D>__{this is my neighborhood. you and your friends have to show me a little respect, ah? this truck you hijacked was in my neighborhood. you should let me wet my beak a little.}
<A>__{fanucci takes a few of the dresses.}
<C>__{fanucci}
<P>__{(sicilian)}
<D>__{i understand each of you cleared around six hundred dollars. i expect two hundred dollars for my protection and i will forget the insult. after all, young people don't know the courtesies due a man like myself.}
<A>__{vito smiles at him and nods.}
<C>__{fanucci}
<P>__{(sicilian)}
<D>__{otherwise the police will come to see you and your wife and children will be dishonored and destitute. of course, if my information as to your gains is incorrect, i will dip my beak just a little. just a little, but no less than one hundred dollars, and don't try to deceive me, eh paisan?}
<C>__{vito}
<P>__{(sicilian) (quietly)}
<D>__{my two friends have my share of the money. i will have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler.}
<C>__{fanucci}
<P>__{(sicilian)}
<D>__{you tell your friends i expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner. don't be afraid to tell them. clemenza and i know each other well, he understands these things. let yourself be guided by him. he has more experience in these matters.}
<C>__{vito}
<P>__{(sicilian) (shrugging innocently)}
<D>__{you must understand, this is all new to me...}
<C>__{fanucci}
<P>__{(sicilian)}

<C>__{vito}
<P>__{(sicilian)}

<P>__{(sicilian) (impressed)}
<D>__{you're a good fellow.}
<A>__{he takes vito's hands and clasps them in his own.}
<C>__{fanucci}
<P>__{(sicilian)}
<D>__{you have respect. a fine thing in the young. next time, speak to me first, eh? perhaps i can help you make your plans.}
<A>__{fanucci turns with the dresses draped over his arms, waving to vito. vito throws the truck in gear, and drives off.}
<B>__{close view on vito}
<A>__{we know that throughout this encounter he has seethed with an icy rage.}
