<L>__{exterior woods night}
<A>__{coffey's hand scoops up some fallen leaves. tilt up to his face as he crunches them under his nose, inhaling their smell. he see the guards throwing him anxious looks. he misreads this, holds out his hand so they can smell too. they do it, just to make him happy.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{c'mon, big boy, keep moving.}
<A>__{a few fireflies come winking through frame as the group presses on... another area woods the trees are growing sparser, opening onto fields. more fireflies are flitting into view, trailing in their wake...}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{how far is it?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{just up ahead...}
<A>__{harry brings them to a thicket of trees. they start removing branches and boughs, uncovering a battered old farmall truck hidden in the brush. the men pause. even more fireflies are swirling around them, growing in number. it's getting downright weird. coffey laughs softly, drawing their attention. a childlike smile has utterly transformed his face. he raises his hand, letting a firefly weave playfully in and out of his fingers.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{hey there, little firefly. where's mrs. firefly this evening?}
<A>__{another firefly joins the first, both now dancing and blinking around his fingers. coffey laughs again.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{oh, there you is. you come out to play too?}
<A>__{the men stand gaping. the fireflies are flitting to coffey as if to a beacon. he waves his hands slowly, fireflies blinking and trailing from his fingertips like magic dust. they begin orbiting his shiny bald head like tiny glowing planet orbiting a sun, their light kicking a mellow sheen off his ebony skin. coffey's eyes meet paul's.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{they seem...drawn to you.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{i love 'em, is why. they don't think no hurtful thoughts. they's just happy to be. happy little lightning bugs...}
<A>__{the men don't know whether to be enchanted or terrified. harry gives paul a look can we go? please?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{c'mon, big boy. upsy daisy.}
<A>__{coffey clambers up on the stakebed. paul and brutal join him. harry gets in behind the wheel, jabs the starter button...}
<B>__{on the stakebed}
<A>__{...while coffey sits with his back to the cab.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{john? do you know where we're taking you?}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{help a lady?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{that's right. help a lady. but how did you know?}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{dunno. tell the truth, boss, i don't know much'a anything. never have.}
<A>__{the truck pulls out. coffey waves as the fireflies get left behind, dwindling away like stars.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{bye, fireflies. bye.}
<B>__{wide angle of countryside}
<A>__{the truck rumbles from the fields onto a dirt road, countless fireflies swirling in its wake...}
