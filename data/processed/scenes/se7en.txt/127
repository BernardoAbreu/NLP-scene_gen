<L>__{interior mills' apartment, bedroom later night}
<A>__{mills and tracy are asleep in their bed. mills' eyes shift under their lids. rapid eye movement. a sound is heard from the other room. mills awakens. he lays still a moment, then gets up, slowly, reaches to take his gun off the bedside table. he grabs his pants from a chair, slides into them.}
<L>__{interior mills' apartment, living room kitchenette night}
<A>__{mills opens the bedroom door and enters quietly, gun held up. he moves, crouching. in the dark, objects in the room and shadows from windows form complex, confusing patterns. mills walks between moving boxes, attempting to remain silent. he aims the gun from point to point as he advances. he gets to a closet. staying on one side, he opens the door and points his gun. he carefully separates the clothing hanging there. nothing. no one. he turns to look over the room. it's the first time we see it in mills' eyes real fear. the door to the apartment is wide open.}
