<D>__{girl, you're even dumber than my husband said you were.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{or did you just forget to take your meds?}
<A>__{lisa whirls around. beth is standing in the doorway, giving lisa a deadly look, like a cat who's just trapped a mouse. beth takes notice of the rose petals on the bed and floor. lisa is wide eyed, terrified, caught. lisa begins to edge her way around the room.}
<C>__{beth }
<D>__{you really fucked up this time... coming back to my house. didn't you get my message?}
<A>__{lisa's eyes dart around for escape. beth seems remarkably calm.}
<C>__{beth }
<D>__{you can look all you want but you're not getting out of here. ot until i've given you the beating of your life... bitch.}
<A>__{and she means it, too. lisa tries to dart around her. but beth cuts her off, grabbing lisa by the throat and forcing her back, slamming her hard against the bed post. lisa bounces off the post, stunned. beth is on her, slapping her hard, grabbing a handful of lisa's hair, ripping it out by the roots as lisa tries to get free. lisa lets out a subhuman shriek of pain. beth tosses the hank of hair aside, keeps on coming. she's beyond pissed.}
<C>__{beth }
<D>__{think you can walk into my house... my bedroom...}
<A>__{beth slaps and punches lisa.}

<P>__{(in pain; terrified, whimpering)}
<D>__{please...}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{please? please what? please don't hurt you?}
<A>__{as beth pummels her, lisa stumbles retreats into the adjoining bathroom. she slams the door shut and throws the lock, face bleeding, looking around for a weapon, something to protect herself with. crash! the bathroom door comes off its hinges as beth barges in.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{beth grabs lisa by the head and slams her face into the bathroom mirror. it cracks. lisa is wobbly, unable to stand. her face is a bloody mess. but before she can collapse, beth props her up.}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{("concerned")}
<D>__{you're bleeding. we need to wash that off.}
<A>__{beth forces lisa down, shoves her head into the toilet and flushes it, holding her there as lisa flops and chokes.}
<C>__{beth }
<D>__{don't worry. i'm not going to drown you.}
<P>__{jerking lisa's head up)}
<D>__{no, no. i'm just getting started...}
<C>__{lisa}
<P>__{(blubbering)}
<D>__{please... i'm sorry...}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{too late, bitch. sorry won't cut it.}
<A>__{beth kicks lisa out of the bathroom.}
<B>__{i}
<A>__{lisa lands on the floor and gets up, rose petals sticking to her gown. as beth comes out of the bathroom, lisa lunges for the night table and grabs the bottle of champagne. she swings it and hits beth is the side of the head. whack! the cork pops and champagne goes spewing everywhere. stunned, beth goes down on her knees. lisa wipes blood from her face, circling beth, lips drawn back and teeth showing like an animal.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{he doesn't love you! i'm the one he wants!}
<P>__{(crazed; screaming)}
<D>__{why can't you get that through your head?}
<A>__{lisa raises the bottle to hit her again. beth lunges forward and tackles her. the bottle goes flying as the two women thrash around on the floor.}
