<LOC>__{EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY}
<ACTION>__{It is 1957, and we are in the deserts of Utah. TONY BENNETT sings "Rags to Riches" on the SOUNDTRACK. Breath-taking scenery stretches out on either side of a highway. The CAMERA MOVES to reveal a Nash Ambassador as it labors up a hill. Twelve cars are caught behind the thirty-mile- per-hour pace. Two cars decide to ignore safety and cross the solid yellow line to pass the pokey car.}
<LOC>__{INT. NASH AMBASSADOR - PARALLEL TIME}
<ACTION>__{Two people are in the straining car -- a woman and her son. The woman is CAROLINE WOLFF. Somewhere in her 30s, she is a pretty woman who can look beautiful if she works at it. (Just now, though, her prettiness is marred by a fading bruise on her right cheekbone.) She is bright and energetic and lively. Even more important than these qualities, though, is her humor. And most important of all is a sensual quality she exudes. Her sensuality is effortless -- as natural to her as the color of her eyes and hair. Men turn on the street to stare at her. The boy is TOBY WOLFF. A    pleasant-faced boy with won- derful eyes, he is 13 --   teetering on the brink of adolescence, so that one   moment he seems like a self- assured teenager, and the   very next like a ten-year-old kid. Just now the ten-year-old kid has the upper hand: bored and weary with the long trip, Toby has been arguing with Caroline, who is ignoring him.}
<CHAR>__{TOBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{... Well,  I mean it. I'm serious -- I do.   You promise and promise, and then  you change your mind, just like  that.}
<CHAR>__{CAROLINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(totally oblivious)}
<DIAL>__{... Uh-huh.}
<CHAR>__{TOBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You wait 'til you ask me for something. Just wait. See if you get it.}
<CHAR>__{CAROLINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(as above)}
<DIAL>__{Toby, hush. Let me just...}
<ACTION>__{So concentrated on her driving she doesn't even finish her sentence, she nurses the car upward. Finally the car crests the hill and starts down. Caroline sighs with relief. She turns to Toby with a smile.}
<CHAR>__{CAROLINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What'd you say?}
<CHAR>__{TOBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I said -- for the twentieth time -- if a person promises somebody something, they can't just turn around and take it back.}
<CHAR>__{CAROLINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, honey, Jesus. Don't start with that again.}
<CHAR>__{TOBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Why not?}
<CHAR>__{CAROLINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Because I'm the mother, and I get to tell you what to do every minute of your life 'til you're eighteen. Seriously, we've got no money. I can't buy you the moccasins.}
<CHAR>__{TOBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I bet if you'd promised Roy some moccasins he'd of got 'em.}
<CHAR>__{CAROLINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No talk about Roy, okay? And ditto the moccasins. We, can't, afford, them.}
<CHAR>__{TOBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, but you did promise...}
<CHAR>__{CAROLINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sue me. Take me to court. Oh, Toby, I know you're disappointed, but...}
<CHAR>__{TOBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Jack.   Call me Jack.}
<CHAR>__{CAROLINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're going to drive me to an early grave: I'm never going to make Salt Lake City.}
<CHAR>__{TOBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Seriously. If a person can't get a stinking miserable pair of moccasins, at least he ought to be able to choose his own name...}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(loud)}
<DIAL>__{... and I wanna be called Jack!}
<CHAR>__{CAROLINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Fine.  And you can call me...}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(she thinks)}
<DIAL>__{... Jeanette. Jeanette Marie.}
<CHAR>__{TOBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, you're so stupid sometimes, I...}
<ACTION>__{The BAWLING of an AIRHORN interrupts him. Both of them look through the back window and see a huge tractor- trailer truck, out of control, bearing down on them. Caroline brakes and steers a hard right, SKIDDING the NASH safely onto the side of the road. The truck, its HORN BLASTING steadily, shimmies and slides past them, and then, hideously, fails to make the next curve: it smashes through the guard rails and into empty space, its HORN still BLARING. Caroline and Toby look at each other, then scramble out of the car.}
<LOC>__{EXT. BROKEN GUARD RAIL - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Other drivers have stopped to look: hundreds of feet below, the truck lies on its back among boulders. Caroline glances, then turns away. She pulls Toby away, one arm around his shoulder.}
<LOC>__{EXT. NASH AMBASSADOR - MINUTES LATER}
<ACTION>__{Caroline fills the Nash's steaming radiator with a can of water.}
<CHAR>__{CAROLINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(not much heat)}
<DIAL>__{Goddamn thing.}
<ACTION>__{She glances back to where a larger crowd of people stare avidly down at the truck. She bites her lip.}
<CHAR>__{CAROLINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, that poor man.}
<ACTION>__{There is a pause.   Then Toby speaks:}
<CHAR>__{TOBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I hope to hell this isn't some kind of omen.}
<ACTION>__{Caroline turns to Toby, her face worried. Then she sees the look in Toby's eyes -- he's ragging her. She grins and gives his shoulder a light, affectionate shove.}
<LOC>__{INT. NASH AMBASSADOR - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Toby (feet up on the dashboard wearing a brand-new pair of Indian moccasins) and Caroline sing "Mood Indigo" together. Toby holds  a complicated-looking, black con- traption which looks something like an antique flashlight.}
<CHAR>__{TOBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{How's this thing work, anyway?}
<CHAR>__{CAROLINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(not confident)}
<DIAL>__{It makes a black light that, uh, causes uranium traces to glow.}
<CHAR>__{TOBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And we just walk along the street and find this glowing uranium?}
<CHAR>__{CAROLINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, it was everywhere in Moab, they say -- just like gold in the gold-rush days.}
<CHAR>__{TOBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But we were too late in Moab, and that guy at the office said nobody'd found any uranium in Salt Lake City.}
<CHAR>__{CAROLINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, that means we'll have the place pretty much to ourselves, huh? Honey, this could be a big break for us. If this works out, oh, just think: we'll get us a house, get rid of this damn Nash Ambassador -- no money worries... It'll be like heaven on a June day.}
<LOC>__{INT. CAR - DAWN}
<ACTION>__{We hear "MOOD INDIGO" on the car RADIO and see that a weary Caroline has driven through the night and Toby is slumped against the passenger door. Toby stirs, then opens his eyes.}
<CHAR>__{CAROLINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Ask me how far we are from Salt Lake City.}
<ACTION>__{Toby is instantly awake, excited. Caroline points to a small highway sign and both she and Toby yell out.}
<DIAL>__{CAROLINE/TOBY Forty-seven miles to go!}
<ACTION>__{Both of them are laughing with excitement. Toby claps his hands together once, very hard, and Caroline yells --}
<LOC>__{EXT. HIGHWAY - MORNING}
<ACTION>__{Well, hell. The Nash Ambassador sits by the side of the road, its hood up, its radiator steaming. Caroline and Toby sit in a patch of shade by the car.}
<CHAR>__{CAROLINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{If I could have one wish right now -- only one wish -- you know what I'd like? I'd like to burn this damn Nash Ambassador to a crisp.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(as Toby laughs)}
<DIAL>__{I'm serious. I hate it. I hate the factory that produced it, and I hate the man who invented it.}
<CHAR>__{TOBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It almost makes me want to see Roy -- he was the only one could make the thing stop overheating.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(a beat)}
<DIAL>__{My God, he was boring. Boring and mean: you sure got crappy taste in boyfriends.}
<ACTION>__{At the mention of Roy's name, Caroline lightly touches the bruise on her right cheekbone. Not enjoying the talk about Roy, she pours the water into the radiator, and speaks directly to the car.}
<CHAR>__{CAROLINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'd like to burn you to the ground.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(to Toby; big smile)}
<DIAL>__{Let's go get rich in Salt Lake City!}
<LOC>__{EXT. SALT LAKE CITY (DOWNTOWN) - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Toby waits beside the Nash Ambassador, looking toward a three-story concrete building. He holds a portable RADIO, which PLAYS DEAN MARTIN singing "Volare."}
<LOC>__{INT. BUILDING - PARALLEL TIME}
<ACTION>__{Caroline, holding the imitation Geiger counter, stands across the counter from a MAN who is looking at her very strangely.}
<CHAR>__{MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're pulling my leg, right?}
<CHAR>__{CAROLINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No, I came here to look for uranium.}
<CHAR>__{MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{My God, lady. If you're looking for uranium, why didn't you go to Moab?}
<CHAR>__{CAROLINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We went there, but everybody'd beaten us there. We were too late.}
<CHAR>__{MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{So you came here just on the chance you'd find uranium? Listen, you mind me saying something to you might sound rude? Lady, you got more courage than you got common sense.}
<LOC>__{EXT. NASH AMBASSADOR - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Caroline exits the building, dumps the Geiger counter in a trash can and strides to the car. She gets in, and says two words:}
<CHAR>__{CAROLINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Don't ask.}
<LOC>__{INT. NASH AMBASSADOR - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Caroline turns the key in the ignition and gets only a maddening RER-RER-RER-RER noise from the ENGINE: wearily, she rests her forehead on the steering wheel.}
<LOC>__{EXT. NASH AMBASSADOR - TWENTY MINUTES LATER}
<ACTION>__{Caroline and Toby have the hood up and are peering into the engine.}
<CHAR>__{TOBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That mechanic in Colorado said it needed points.}
<CHAR>__{CAROLINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I know. Don't tell me what I already know. This thing's a bottomless pit. I don't know what to do. No matter how much money I pour into it...}
<ACTION>__{Suddenly a WOMAN in pedal-pushers and a thin, inexpensive sweater stops. She's vaguely low-class, but friendly and sympathetic.}
<CHAR>__{WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'd rather be whipped with a belt than have car trouble. 'Course these days I don't have to worry about that. My husband got laid off at the mill, and they repossessed the car, so wherever I wanna go, I just have to hoof it, you know?}
<ACTION>__{Caroline smiles, then her face changes.}
<CHAR>__{CAROLINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You don't have    a car?}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(as the    Woman shakes    her head)}
<DIAL>__{You want this    one?}
<ACTION>__{Shocked, the Woman says --}
<CHAR>__{WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I... uh... I...}
<CHAR>__{TOBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're gonna give our car away?}
<CHAR>__{CAROLINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(to the Woman)}
<DIAL>__{Seriously. It needs points, and it overheats constantly, but you can have it if you want it, because my hand to God, I can't look at it one more minute.}
<CHAR>__{WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, sure...}
<CHAR>__{CAROLINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Get the bags out. Get the owner's slip out of the glove compartment. We're rid of this son-of-a-bitch pink and white albatross. You don't mind taking a car with a big dent in the passenger door?}
<CHAR>__{WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hell, no.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(she looks)}
<DIAL>__{There's no dent there...}
<ACTION>__{Caroline draws back her leg and delivers a terrific, flat-footed kick to the door, leaving a dent the size of a dish-pan.}
<CHAR>__{CAROLINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, yes there is!}
<ACTION>__{Toby hands the Woman the owner's slip, Caroline gives her the keys.}
<CHAR>__{WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{... you really just giving me this car?}
<CHAR>__{CAROLINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's done. It's yours. You got yourself a Nash Ambassador!}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(to Toby)}
<DIAL>__{Let's go!}
<ACTION>__{Both of them pick up two bags apiece -- all they have in the world -- and off they go, feeling good.}
<LOC>__{EXT. CITY STREET - DAY (FEW MINUTES LATER) 1957 is all around us: gas is 29.9 cents a gallon; bread}
<ACTION>__{is 19 cents a loaf; cars are curved and heavily chromed; people occasionally nod and smile at strangers; children carry hula hoops. In all, a gentler time. Caroline and Toby stride along briskly, as if they knew where they were going.}
<CHAR>__{CAROLINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{... find ourselves a cheap room someplace, we'll get you into school, I'll brush up on my typing and get a job, and things'll start looking up. I feel it: the good times are coming. And at least we're rid of that damn Nash Ambassador!}
<CHAR>__{TOBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, and like Dad used to say, 'We may be broke, but we're never poor.' And later, if we get a house with a big yard, I could get a collie, you know? One like Lad or Grey Dawn. And someday maybe a palomino. And I'm going to try harder in school, too...}
<ACTION>__{The two of them walk on -- a bit foolish, but, in an odd way, brave as hell.}

<DIAL>__{Gee, thanks a lot, Mom -- believe them instead of me.}
<CHAR>__{CAROLINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{If you care anything about me at all, you'll shut up.}
<CHAR>__{TOBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, well if you'd stayed married to Dad none of this would've ever happened.}
<CHAR>__{CAROLINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Look, don't you put that    on my back: I can't make your     father call you. I can't make     your brother write you. They     dumped you. Yes. But it's not      my fault.}
<LOC>__{INT. CAROLINE AND TOBY'S ROOM - AFTERNOON}
<ACTION>__{The place is pretty bleak: a room and a half, Murphy beds, linoleum floors, and a bath down the hall. Caroline and Toby enter. She pulls down the Murphy bed and falls onto it fully dressed, saying:}

<DIAL>__{My head is killing me.}

<DIAL>__{I started dinner. The potatoes are frying, and I'm heating up the hot dogs.}
<ACTION>__{Caroline sees that he's trying to make it up to her, and pats the bed for him to sit down next to her. He moves to sit beside her.}

<CHAR>__{TOBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm sorry.}
<CHAR>__{CAROLINE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I know you are, honey. Ah, well -- it wasn't fire, and nobody bled, so I guess we're okay.}
<ACTION>__{The TELEPHONE RINGS and she answers it.   When she hears the VOICE on the other end she once again  touches her right cheekbone with a finger -- the spot  where the bruise had been. She sags back against a   wall.}

<LOC>__{INT. CAROLINE AND TOBY'S KITCHEN - ONE HOUR LATER}
<ACTION>__{Caroline, Toby and ROY are eating at the tiny table. Roy is good-looking in a meaty, hairy-chested sort of way. Though he is on his very best behavior just now, there is a mean streak in him. Toby, delighted, holds a Winchester .22 rifle across his lap -- a peace-making gift from Roy.}
<CHAR>__{ROY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{... I found me a room, but it's clear the hell and gone 'cross town. And I think I got a job lined up doin' tune-ups in a Texaco station. How you like it at Winstead's?}

<CHAR>__{ROY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Aw, he won't hear anything.}
<ACTION>__{Again he pulls her toward him; again she turns her head from the kiss. Then it happens. A spasm of anger passes across his face and he shoves Caroline away from him. It's a hard shove, but nothing that could really hurt her. Violence has happened before between these two, and they recognize it. Caroline is immediately on guard, and Roy is apologetic.}
<CHAR>__{ROY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Shit, baby, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. I'm just so glad to see you.}

<ACTION>__{Dressed for bed, Toby stands by an open window. He can hear every WORD of ROY'S, who continues to apologize between kisses. The room is illuminated by a nearby streetlamp. The frosty air from the open window causes his breath to steam. He raises two fingers to his lips, pretends to take a drag on a cigarette and blows out the steam from his breath. The VOICES in the other room grow a bit LOUDER, almost to an argument, and then SUBSIDE again. Toby takes another drag from his pretend cig- arette. He looks very young.}

Dwight's name is called. He takes his position, but clowns around, SHOOTING first left-handed, then right- handed, then with both eyes closed. His score is raised: 24. There is scattered laughter, and Dwight leads it -- hell, it's all a joke to him, his attitude says. Caroline takes her stance. Rock-steady, she SHOOTS her TEN SHOTS and waits. And then it comes: 98.

Arthur throws   punches sidearm, with lots of wrist action, but there are   so many of them. Before Toby can react, Arthur has hit   him four times, including one wild haymaker that puts Toby   on his knees. While Toby's still on his knees, Arthur tries to kick him in the stomach.

Toby closes with him, to hold those flailing arms still, and the two stagger around the street like drunken dancers. They separate, exchange a few blows, then grapple with each other again. Then Arthur hooks Toby's leg, trips him, and the two roll off the shoulder of the road and down an embankment. They hit the muddy bottom of the gully still hitting, flailing, kicking -- first Toby is on top, then Arthur, then Toby, then Arthur. By now they are panting, each breath is a heave, a gasp. Then, suddenly, Arthur gives out completely -- he falls on top of Toby, pressing him deeper into the mud. With his last bit of strength Toby throws the bigger boy off him and sits up, while PEPPER BARKS FURIOUSLY at him and threatens to nip his leg. Toby staggers to his feet and starts to climb the gully. He looks relieved -- at least it's over. No, it's not. From behind him he hears three words.}

Dwight stands in a corner of the room, his saxophone to his lips. He's playing along with the MUSIC, but silently. Occasionally he gets overcome and accidentally causes the saxophone to squawk. The Irish ballad ends, and Lawrence Welk's Champagne Orchestra strikes up a lively polka. Dwight takes a sip of his drink and grabs Caroline, pulls her to her feet, and begins to dance with her. A polka can be a decorous, contained dance. He dances Caroline vigorously around the living room, out into the kitchen, around the table, and then back again. Dwight is really good, and Caroline matches him every step of the way. Skipper turns the  VOLUME UP and Dwight kicks the dance into an even higher, wilder gear: The kids clap on the beat, the two whirl and stamp and spin. Faster and faster -- Caroline's heel catches an end table and sends it spinning and faster they go. Caroline's head is thrown back; she's laughing with pleasure. As the MUSIC reaches its CLIMAX, Dwight spins Caroline back to the sofa, lets her go, and WHAM! she lands back where she was seated exactly on the last note of the song.

He lands a blow between Dwight's eyes that bangs the man back against the wall. Dwight grabs the pan with the hot water from the hotdogs, flings it at Toby. Most of it misses. Again they grapple. Toby manages to throw Dwight down, then grabs a broom that has fallen to the floor, presses it against Dwight's throat, using his good hand and one knee. Dwight's mouth gapes wide, his eyes bulge, and he jerks himself frantically trying to dislodge Toby, but Toby hangs on like grim death. Desperate, Dwight grabs Toby's bandaged hand, bringing it close to his own face, and bites the stump of Toby's injured finger as hard as he can. Toby and Pearl scream simultaneously. Pearl in horror, Toby in pain. Pearl runs into her bedroom. Toby reels back in pain, holding his freshly-bleeding hand. Dwight takes his chance, grabs Toby by the throat, forces him down onto the floor and begins to choke the boy. Toby's eyelids begin to flutter. He's losing consciousness. WHAM! From out of nowhere a baseball bat hits Dwight flat across the shoulder blades, knocking the breath out  of him, stunning him momentarily. As he looks up, we   see Caroline, one of the baseball bats from the utility  porch drawn back, aimed at Dwight's head, ready to strike  again.}
