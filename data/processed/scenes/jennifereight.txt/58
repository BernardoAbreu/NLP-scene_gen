<L>__{58: exterior fishing deck above wheelhouse. boat. day.}
<A>__{wind over and sea content and anchored about a mile from shore. smoke from a dying barbecue and nat king cole croons "unforget able." ross sports shades and sits staring down the line. some one plays lousy guitar and he shifts eyes into the well of the boat. helena teaches bobby to play chords. hardly worth the ef fort but they're enjoying it. berlin looks down from the oppos ite side of the deck. his gaze interrupted by margie "you want another coke, honey?" sure he does and her eyes travel to ross.}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{you want something, darling?}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{i wouldn't mind another b.e.e.r.}
<A>__{in code so berlin won't understand. but he and ross swap grins.}
<D>__{how much longer you on that diet?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i'm doing it by the day ...}
<A>__{margie climbs the stairs with drinks and drinks a beer herself. popped cans change the subject. this seems like a question ber lin doesn't really want to ask & margie doesn't want to answer.}
<D>__{how's your little sister?}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{she's in europe ..}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{working?}
<A>__{clearly a sensitive subject and ross decides the truth is best.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{she married some english prick.}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{he's not that bad of a guy ..?}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{got a handshake like a partially excited penis.}
<A>__{the joke doesn't reach berlin. margie's hand is on his shoulder.}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{her loss, darlin ..}
<A>__{and she heads for the lower deck. a sweet smile as she descends.}
<D>__{anyway, you're doing o. k. she's a sweet heart.}
<A>__{and also playing the guitar "in my life." and she does it well.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{why's she blind, bro?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{car accident.}
<A>__{slow banging of something swaying. and this exchange goes slow.}
<D>__{whole family wiped out.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{no shit.}
<A>__{a bleeper goes on one of the lines and ross twists in his seat.}
<D>__{strap me in. here comes another.}
<A>__{and he winds in yet another three quarters of a pound mackerel.}
<D>__{worst day's fishing i ever had ..}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{it's been a great day.}
<A>__{ross dexterously extracts the hook with serious eyes on berlin.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{you just go easy, brother ...}
<P>__{(looks at fish)}
<D>__{alright, we're all goin home.}
