<L>__{exterior mountain roadside with tanker and en tourage}
<A>__{beside the tanker, a panel truck sits, engine idling. phony logo on its side little debbie snack cakes. a ramp is lowered, and a car begins backing up into the truckbed, facing outwards. inside the truckbed, harried blue suits hurriedly unwrap the frost covered corpse of imn al rahman and place him behind the wheel. meanwhile, at the back of the tanker a blue suit puts a padlock on the utility box as he passes.}
<B>__{snaps it shut.}
<A>__{back with henessey same time he hears two flat crack !s on the still air.}
<C>__{henessey}

<C>__{henessey}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{c'mon, buddy. do one thing right, just this once... please...}
<A>__{closes his eyes. gathers himself. long pause...}
<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{piece of cake.}
<A>__{he leaps from the roof and makes a death run. gun in one hand, radio in the other. swerving and dodging like a broken field runner, charly in his ear screaming:}
<C>__{charly }
<D>__{your nine, on your nine!}
<A>__{he spins, blasts away, dead guy, pitching forward smoke, billowing, making him cough...}
<C>__{charly }
<D>__{30 degrees left, mitch. left.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{your other left.}
<A>__{stumbling, catching himself. barreling forward.}
<C>__{charly }

<A>__{he breaks right.}
<C>__{charly }
<D>__{fuck me, i was wrong, get outta threre!}
<A>__{he staggers out of the smoke: two men, mp 5 machine guns. trained on his chest. he struggles to aim, oh, shit two distant cracks. the bad men go away, catapulted backwards. henessey shouts into the radio:}
<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{gracias.}
<C>__{charly }
<D>__{de nada.}
<A>__{up above, on the hill charly fires shot after shot. every time she squeezes the trigger, someone dies. no such thing as wounded, we're talking st. peter looks up from a magazine and says holy shit, it's the lunch rush at kate mantilini's.}
<B>__{back down below}
<A>__{the smoke clears and mitch sees the tanker. right there, thirty yards away. yellow utility box. no one in the way.}
<C>__{charly }
<D>__{end run, mitch, go wide!}
<A>__{he breaks for the truck.}
<C>__{charly }
<D>__{no, goddamn you, they got you flanked...!}
<A>__{everybody fires a gun.}
<B>__{mitch gets hit}
<A>__{takes one high in the chest, spins him...!}
<B>__{up on the hill}
<A>__{charly sprays on full auto, dices to tatters the combat zone, extinguishing the gunmen, too little too late because}
<B>__{mitch is in deep}
<A>__{bam ! bullet takes out his right arm, fuck you, buddy, doesn't miss a beat, simply tosses the gun over to the other hand and keeps shooting, blows that fucker down and now he's staggering into the trees, and collapses, and hits... and lies very still and bleeds. as echoes of gunfire die slowly, we hear:}
<C>__{henessey }
<D>__{dear ma: i'm looking at the ants, they're pretty great. some really funny ants here, ma. all these funny ants, think i will stay and watch 'em awhile...}
<B>__{up on the hill}
<A>__{aftermath... charly's out of ammo. flings aside the rifle, snarling in a helpless rage something else, then. sound, nearby. building in pitch, reaching a crescendo }
<B>__{a screaming chopper rises behind her.}
<A>__{crests the cliff and hovers like the sword of damocles.}
