<L>__{interior day police station interrogation room}
<A>__{still wearing his uniform, ben is sitting alone in one of the interrogation rooms of the police station. his haggard face expresses great grief. his sister's death has left him distraught. he fiddles with an empty plastic cup in his hands. the classic two way mirror facing him, throws back his reflection. ben knows that he is being watched. behind the two way mirror, amy observes him. larry is standing next to her.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{the water has obliterated most of the marks. no trace of struggle or broken entry, the entrance door was locked.}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{the person who did this must have had the keys to her apartment, or otherwise it was somebody she knew...}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{he would never have laid a finger on her. when their father died, ben took care of his sister. angela meant the world to him.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{listen, so far, his statement is pretty consistent with the facts... we checked it out, he did place a call from work at 12:30, and the woman's downstairs neighbors claim they started noticing the water leakage at around two in the morning. the daytime security guard, lorenzo sappeli, confirms he came on after ben's shift at seven a.m. the only strange thing, and it may just be a coincidence, is that ben told sappeli that he had decided to quit his job, as if he was planning to go away somewhere... did he mention anything about it to you?}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{no, lately, communication hasn't quite been our strong pointerior..}
<P>__{(she smiles)}
<D>__{i only found out yesterday that he was staying at his sister's. what are you going to do with him?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i figure we'll let him go. at this point we haven't got any real reason to keep him here. and, i think he's had his share for the day.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{you know what's gonna happen if you let him go. he won't stop here. i know him, he won't stop until he finds who did this to her.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{listen, where we stand now, we got nothing, not a single clue. i'm sure he can help us.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{what kind of friend are you? you are using him. he's not a cop anymore.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{he's still the best one i know, even if he's one of the suspects.}
<A>__{amy comes closer to the two way mirror. she looks at her ex husband on the other side. he seems overcome with grief and confusion. she can see the distress in his eyes.}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{try to keep an eye on him.}
