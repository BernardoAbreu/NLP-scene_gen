<L>__{interior raleigh's house day}
<A>__{we see raleigh from behind. he's holding something, and dancing slowly about, and crooning a low song, in the oddest way. beyond him, half glimpsed, an inner room, where bess is resting on a bed. now in his solitary dance raleigh turns, and we see he's holding a new born baby boy. he kisses the baby's little bald head, and sings his wordless song. footsteps outside. the door opens, and a royal servant enters, followed by other servants and guards.}
<C>__{royal servant}
<D>__{her majesty the queen!}
<A>__{elizabeth enters, in formal style. she stands and takes in the scene raleigh holding his baby son the room beyond bess rises at once and comes through to make her curtsey to the queen. elizabeth seems not to see her. a regal wave at the servants and guards. they withdraw. elizabeth stalks round the room. no reason to suppose her displeasure has passed.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{when was the birth?}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{four nights ago.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{the mother is well?}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{thank god.}
<A>__{now elizabeth turns to bess, and their eyes meet. the queen puts out her hand and touches bess lightly on one cheek. a silent forgiveness.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{and the child?}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{my son is well.}
<A>__{now for the first time she looks at the baby.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{your elizabeth has a child. you must be proud.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{elizabeth moves away, unable to bear seeing the baby.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{and fulfilled?}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{as any man can be.}
<A>__{elizabeth looks at him in silence for a long moment.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{and do you still dream of your shining city, your new world?}
<C>__{aleigh}
<D>__{more than ever.}
<A>__{she turns to go. but before she reaches the door, she stops.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{i'd like to give your son my blessing.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{i would be honoured.}
<A>__{elizabeth takes the baby in her arms. she holds him carefully. she finds herself more moved than she had expected. she bends her head over him, and turns her back on raleigh. raleigh watches and waits. and waits. on elizabeth: her cheek pressed to the baby's head. her eyes closed.}
<C>__{elizabeth }
<D>__{i am called the virgin queen. and yet i have many children... you are all my children. there is no jewel, be it never so rich a prize, which i put before this jewel: i mean, your love. i want no more wars. england is enough for me. i want no lordship over your souls. only a free people can love.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and in your love is my life.}
<B>__{end titles}
