<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{sometimes i don't want her. it's my fucking wedding, don't you get it? i want my table to be perfect.}
<A>__{paul kisses her on the forehead.}
<C>__{paul}

<C>__{kieran}
<P>__{(to carol)}
<D>__{he's not kidding.}
<C>__{sidney}

<C>__{carol}
<D>__{hee hee hee.}
<A>__{paul gives him a look. sidney starts humming paul's}
<B>__{dishwasher theme.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{sidney, you're a nice young man. you make a lot of money and the world is your oyster. but you don't know shit about loading a dishwasher.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{sir, with all due respect, the mantle has passed.}
<A>__{paul takes a moment to size sidney up then spins on his heel to the dishwasher. time cut sidney has his sleeves up and starts to load.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{what's the time limit?}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{two minutes.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{are you comfortable with that, sir? i could spot you thirty seconds.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you young people should all go fuck yourselves.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{dad!}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{ha!}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{you see paul, i think your problem lies in lid placement.}
<C>__{sidney }
<D>__{inverting the lids and stacking them in the upper level is really for amateurs. it's passe.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{rachel, you're out of the will.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{observe.}
<A>__{with a flourish, sidney presents a beautifully stacked dishwasher. paul pats his shoulder somberly.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{clean out this machine please, boy. so i can break out the whup ass.}
<A>__{screaming all around. kym jumps up and down with her arms on rachel's shoulders. rachel glances at her sister, laughing.}
<D>__{sidney kieran}
<P>__{(delightedly)}
<D>__{he's breakin' out the whup ass!}
<B>__{a sweet montage.}
<A>__{paul is loading the dishwasher like a champ. carol and emma are smiling and giggling. kieran has his eye on the clock. sidney trash talks from the sidelines.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{you know one of the early signs of senile dementia is an obsessive need to organize.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{rachel, go fetch me my dart gun.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{i find it touching but ultimately sad when the warriors of yesteryear are reluctant to lay down their plastic containers from zabar's and retire gracefully.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{kieran, how's my time?}
<C>__{kieran}
<D>__{you have twenty five seconds.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i need more dishes. you amateur!}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{what? no way!}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{somebody give me some dishes!}
<A>__{kym yanks open a cupboard and passes a handful of dishes to paul. he begins to load them.}
<B>__{close on paul}
<A>__{he has a bowl in his hands. we see the bowl is a plastic child's bowl with engines and cabooses all over it. paul turns the bowl around in his hands like a steering wheel. it dawns on kym that she's handed her father ethan's bowl. she is stricken. paul looks to carol. he seems bewildered. the kitchen falls silent and carol takes ethan's bowl and places it in the sink, out of sight. she leads paul gently out of the kitchen. close on kym close on rachel she turns and leaves the kitchen. sidney follows her. emma and norman sklear step out onto the porch. kieran takes the ethan bowl from the sink and puts it quietly back in the cupboard and shuts the door. kym doesn't know what to do.}
