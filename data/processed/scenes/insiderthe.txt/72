<L>__{interior a japanese restaurant, washington d.c. night}
<A>__{and we see lowell and wigand sitting in their stocking feet at a traditional japanese table in a private screened room... a traditionally dressed japanese waitress waiting to take their order... wigand conversing with her in japanese... the waitress formally nods, and leaves...}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{what did you get us?}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{tempura...}
<A>__{and wigand drinks some more saki.}
<C>__{wigand }
<D>__{the internet said you did graduate work in wisconsin, then went to uc la jolla with professor...marcus?}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{marcuse. yeah. he was my mentor. he had a major influence on the new left in the late '60s...and on me, personally.}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{next to your father?}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{my father? what the hell's that got to do with my father?}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{is that why you became a journalist? then you get to ask all the questions?}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{you charge by the hour?}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{my father was a mechanical engineer...most ingenious man i ever knew.}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{well, my father left us when i was five years old. he was not}
<A>__{the most ingenious}
<D>__{man i ever knew... let's get back to brown & williamson. if you decide to go on "60 minutes," i got to know everything about why you got fired.}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{they're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. i got to know what they're gonna throw. you understand?}
<C>__{wigand}
<P>__{(concedes)}
<D>__{i drink. a couple of occasions more than i should have.}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{i was cited}
<A>__{for shoplifting once. but it}
<D>__{was a mistake...}
<P>__{(hesitant, after a beat)}
<D>__{i pushed liane one time. we were both stressed out because of the pressure. she went to her mother's.}
<P>__{(out of the blue)}
<D>__{i got fired because when i get angry i have difficulty censoring myself. and i don't like to be pushed around! lowell i'm}
<A>__{not pushing you around!}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{i'm asking you questions.}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{i'm just a commodity to you, aren't i? i could be anything. right? anything worth putting on between commercials...}
<C>__{lowell}
<P>__{(honest)}
<D>__{...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{to me? you are not}
<A>__{a commodity. what}
<D>__{you are is important.}
<A>__{and he's begun to consciously or unconsciously "sell"...}
<C>__{lowell }
<D>__{you go public and thirty million people hear what you got to say, nothing, i mean nothing, will ever be the same again.}
<A>__{wigand doesn't react.}
<C>__{lowell }
<D>__{you believe that?}
<C>__{wigand}
<P>__{(skeptical)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{you should. because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. and that's the power you have.}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{you believe that ?}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{i believe that? yes, i believe that.}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{you believe that because you get information out to people...something happens?}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? having status? and maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? something to do on a sunday night. and maybe it won't change a fucking thing. and people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. used up! broke, alone!}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! i never abandoned a source!}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{i don't think you really understand }
<C>__{lowell}
<P>__{(running over)}
<D>__{no, don't evade a choice you}
<A>__{gotta make}
<D>__{be questioning my}
<A>__{reputation or "60}
<D>__{minutes'" with this cheap skepticism!}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{i have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! and what are you puttin' up? you're puttin' up words!}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{words! while you've been dickin' around at fucking company golf tournaments, i been out in the world , giving my word and backing it up with action.}
<A>__{lowell is getting very close, in spite of the value of wigand, to telling jeff to take his story and stick it up his ass.}
<C>__{lowell }
<D>__{now, are you going to go do this thing, or not?}
<A>__{wigand abruptly rises...}
<C>__{wigand}
<P>__{(surprisingly mild)}
<D>__{i said i'd call the kids before they went to bed. onisa...}
<A>__{and turning, he crosses the restaurant. and that's where it hangs.}
