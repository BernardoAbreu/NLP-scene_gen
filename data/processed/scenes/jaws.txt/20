<L>__{exterior amity street day}
<A>__{in front of amity's only music store, a battered old pick up truck pulls in to the curb. quint and his mate cross silently heading into the music store.}
<L>__{interior amity music store day}
<A>__{a gently tinkling bell tolls quint's entrance. inside the store, a ten year old boy is being shown a clarinet. he is playing a mellow low tone, and running "ode to joy." quint looms past him like neptune rising from the deep, and lets his hand drop on the counter with a slap that sounds like a club on flesh. the shopkeeper abandons the little boy and meets quinterior}
<C>__{shopkeeper}
<D>__{hello, mr. quinterior}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{four spools of number 12 piano wire, okay? i ordered them.}
<C>__{shopkeeper}
<P>__{(finding them under the counter)}
<D>__{yessir, right here. what do those fish do, eat this stuff?}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{they choke on it.}
<A>__{without waiting for it to be wrapped, he picks up the gleaming wire in his gnarled fist, and drops a bill on the counter.}
<C>__{shopkeeper}
<D>__{bye now.}
<A>__{no answer from quint, who stops and sings along with the boy. the little kid's music degenerates into a series of awkward squeaks and blurps, as quint stares at him. quint continues out the door, threading his way through the people in the street like some great fish. as he gets up into the cab of his pick up, its door swings open so we can see a crude stylized shark decorating its side. it slams behind him as quint gets in and drives away.}
