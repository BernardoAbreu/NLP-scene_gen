<L>__{int gus's car later}
<A>__{hazel is terrified. turns out, gus is the world's worst driver. when he brakes, her body flies forward against the seatbelt. and when he hits the gas, seconds later, her neck snaps back in the seat. gus sees the look on her face.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i failed the test a couple times.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{you don't say.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{most amputees can drive with no problem but... yeah. not me.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i'm surprised you have a license.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{tell me about it!}
<A>__{another brake forces hazel against the seat belt.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{the fourth time i took the test... it was going about how this is going... and when it was over, the instructor looks at me and goes, "your driving, while unpleasant... is not technically unsafe."}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{aha. cancer perk.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{total cancer perk.}
<A>__{a few beats of silence.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{so what happened to you?}
<A>__{hazel takes a deep breath. she's told this story before but somehow this seems different.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i was 13 when they found it.}
<A>__{and as she speaks, we see it unfold. smash cut to:}
