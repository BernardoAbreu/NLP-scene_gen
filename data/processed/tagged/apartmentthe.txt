<A>__{the piano player is consulting the watch on his upraised left arm. he drops the arm in a signal, and the lights go out. at the same time, he strikes up auld lang syne. all over the dimly lit room, couples get to their feet, embracing and joining in the song. in the last booth, sheldrake leans across the table, kisses fran.}
<C>__{sheldrake}
<D>__{happy new year, fran.}
<A>__{fran's expression is preoccupied. sheldrake faces in the direction of the pianist, and holding his glass aloft, sings along with the others. as auld lang syne comes to an end, the place explodes noisily there is a din of horns, ratchets, and shouted greetings. the lights come up again. in the last booth, sheldrake turns back toward fran but she is no longer there. her paper hat lies abandoned on her vacated chair.}

<D>__{fran }
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{ where are you, fran?}

<L>__{exterior brownstone house night}
<A>__{fran, a coat thrown over the dress she was wearing at the rickshaw, comes down the street almost at a run. there is a happy, expectant look on her face. she hurries up the steps of the house and through the front door.}
<L>__{interior staircase and second floor landing night}
<A>__{fran mounts the stairs eagerly. as she reaches the landing and heads for bud's apartment, there is a loud, sharp report from inside. fran freezes momentarily, then rushes to the door.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{mr. baxter!}
<P>__{(pounding on door)}
<D>__{mr. baxter! mr. baxter!}
<A>__{the door opens and there stands bud, the bottle of champagne he has just uncorked still foaming over in his hand. he stares at fran unbelievingly.}
<C>__{fran}
<P>__{(sagging with relief)}
<D>__{are you all right?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i'm fine.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{are you sure? how's your knee?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i'm fine all over.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{mind if i come in?}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(still stunned)}
<D>__{of course not.}
<L>__{interior the apartment night}
<A>__{fran comes in and bud shuts the door. the room is the same as we left it, except for an empty champagne glass standing on the coffee table.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{let me get another glass.}
<A>__{he goes to one of the cartons, takes out a champagne glass wrapped in newspaper, starts to unwrap it.}
<C>__{fran}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{who knows? another neighborhood another town another job i'm on my own.}

<D>__{what did you do with the cards?}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(indicating carton)}
<D>__{in there.}
<A>__{fran takes the deck of cards and the gin rummy score pad out of the carton, settles herself on the couch, starts to shuffle the cards expertly.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{what about mr. sheldrake?}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{i'm going to send him a fruit cake every christmas.}
<A>__{bud sinks down happily on the couch, and fran holds out the deck to him.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{cut.}
<A>__{bud cuts a card, but doesn't look at it.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i love you, miss kubelik.}

<C>__{fran}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{shut up and deal!}
<A>__{bud begins to deal, never taking his eyes off her. fran removes her coat, starts picking up her cards and arranging them. bud, a look of pure joy on his face, deals and deals and keeps dealing. and that's about it. story wise.}
