<L>__{exterior pembroke day}
<A>__{marion's men, led by rev. oliver, tend to the dead. some dig in the small graveyard adjacent to the remains of the church. others carry out the grim task of pulling the charred bodies out of the rubble.}
<B>__{on the edge of town}
<A>__{marion sits alone. gabriel walks up behind him.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{father, tell me what happened at fort wilderness?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{you know what happened.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{no, i don't.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{everyone knows. it's what made me a hero. me, harry lee, all of us. i got a medal. men bought me drinks. they still do sometimes. everyone knows what happened.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{tell me what everyone doesn't know.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{and what do they know?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{that the french and cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{that's not enough. tell me.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born. i was drunk and i was foolish enough to answer her.}
<A>__{marion shakes his head to himself.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{that's why it was four years between you and thomas. it took me that long to regain her respect.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i'm not my mother. i can't have the respect without the knowing.}
<A>__{marion's quiet for a moment. then he speaks:}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{it was in '63. it was a bad time. the french and the cherokee had raided along the blue ridge. all the english settlers took refuge at fort wilderness but the french captured it. we were sent in relief. harry lee, billings, sixty of us. we already had something of a reputation for being... harsh. when we got there the fort was abandoned. not a french soldier or cherokee anywhere. they had left a week earlier. what we found was... bad.}
<A>__{marion grows quieter with the memory of how bad.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{they had left the settlers there. the men had been burned alive, the women were in pieces and the children were on stakes.}
<A>__{marion's silent for a moment.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{we buried them, then we went to track. it was a cold trail and they were moving fast. we went faster. we caught up to them at kentucky ford.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{go on.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{we took our time with them and gave every one of them worse than they had given at the fort. it was two weeks before they were all dead, all except two. we put the heads on a pallet and had the two we let live take it to the french at fort ambercon.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the eyes, fingers and tongues we put in a basket and sent that down the asheulot to the cherokee.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the french stayed east of the blue ridge after that and the cherokee broke their treaty with the french and stayed out of the fight.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that seemed to make a difference. the war went another year, things went better... and men bought us drinks.}
<A>__{gabriel is silent. marion looks at him closely.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{it was a different time, son. and you're a better man than that.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i see, do as i say, not as i do.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{they hear horses hooves. abner rides in from the opposite side of the village from the church, not having seen the results of the massacre. excited, he dismounts.}
<C>__{abner}
<D>__{they're here! continentals, they're here!}
<A>__{marion and gabriel just look at him. abner is confused by their reaction. then he sees the remains of the church and the laid out, charred bodies.}
