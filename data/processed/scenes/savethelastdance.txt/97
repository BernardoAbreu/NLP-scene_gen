<L>__{interior roy's rowhouse hallway front door that night}
<A>__{sara unlocks the door. she and patrick enter. she turns on the lights. looks at him. answers the unspoken question.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{he's in d.c. blues alley. he'll be gone all night.}
<A>__{patrick sits down on the sofa. sara crosses to the stereo, turns it on. a sax solo begins playing.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{roy's demo. the only one he ever cut. kinda grows on you.}
<A>__{a beat. somewhere between five seconds and forever. then:}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{wanna see my room?}
<A>__{patrick looks at her, nods. he gets up, follows sara behind the partition into her "room." they stand there for a moment. he cups her face with his hands. kisses her. they begin to take off each other's clothes, alternately sure and fumbling; a bit awkward, a bit urgent. sara unzips patrick's pants, catches something other than his clothes. patrick winces in pain. she looks at him with an embarrassed grimace. says this very low.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{sorry...}
<A>__{they kiss again, stumble backward to her futon. fall down upon it and begin to make love.}
