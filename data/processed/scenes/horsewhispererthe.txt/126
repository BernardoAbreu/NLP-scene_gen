<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{the faces are beautiful. laughing. eating. everyone is tanned and exhausted after a long day, but filled with life and eager to live it. the tables are covered with heavy food. the communion at this table is as much a part of the ritual as the branding itself... annie and grace look different to us. tanned from the sun, their bodies sore they feel softened, yet more vital. as if the artifice had been worn off... the armor of urban life. as the table thrives with conversations, we focus on: annie and ellen booker. annie looks calmer than we've seen her and more naturally beautiful. she is seated beside ellen booker. we sense they have been talking for a while. annie is so sincerely interested in listening to her, she's hardly touched her own plate...}
<C>__{ellen booker}
<D>__{... he was a blacksmith by trade, my father. my grandson joe was named for him. but he always dreamed of having his own place and raising horses...}
<A>__{we see tom a few places down and across from annie and his mother but fully aware of their conversation.}
<C>__{ellen booker}
<D>__{he'd heard of some land. what's stockett now. rode out there. got off his horse and walked about as far as he could in one way. then he walked as far as he could another way and another until he got back to where he started and that's where he put his roots down... that's where my husband and i ranched and raised frank and tommy...}
<A>__{she motions proudly to tom who looks up. annie smiles to him. he looks to her with gratitude for the respect she's showing his mother.}
<C>__{ellen booker}
<D>__{quite a different life from what you know, i expect. which place to you call home?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{well, i was born in london, but my father was an ambassador and we moved constantly. i've lived in a lot of places but i don't really know what i'd call home.}
<A>__{tom listens to this.}
<C>__{ellen booker}
<D>__{an ambassador! my! that's very important.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{he was a wonderful man.}
<A>__{she looks to tom and he can sense a sadness around this in her eyes.}
<C>__{diane}
<P>__{(to grace)}
<D>__{i sure hope you're gonna eat more than that, young lady. you're a growing girl.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i've never eaten this much in my life.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{probably never worked so hard, neither. those arms of yours are gonna be pretty sore tomorrow. i will give you a little bit of ointment i make. it's a magic recipe my mama gave me.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{we used to call diane's mother medicine woman. none of us never went to the doctor when she was alive.}
<A>__{annie and grace listen in...}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{too bad she wasn't here for old henry vanoker...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{not much would have helped him.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{i never got that whole story, what happened?}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{old henry was changing a flat tire on his truck over on 118 when that...}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{... two hundred year old jack he has gives way and the side of that truck come slamming down on that rock he calls head...}
<A>__{there's laughter everyone knows old henry. except:}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{knocked him out for a while. he woke up, finished putting on the tire and drove himself to the hospital.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{old fool... darling, pass down those peas for me, thank you.}
<A>__{annie and grace don't know how to respond... but everyone else takes it their stride as they continue eating... grace notices joe is whispering something to frank, who nods his head and speaks to the table.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{huh, joe here has something to say.}
<A>__{joe stands, somewhat formally, with his hat on.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i wrote this for you grandma...}
<A>__{mrs. booker, and diane, beam. annie and grace don't know what to expect. joe stands straight as an arrow and recites a poem from memory... at first, annie and grace appear to be embarrassed for the boy but soon they can't help but be won over by his guilessness. he finishes and everyone applauds. hank's wife asks:}
<C>__{hank's wife}
<D>__{that was lovely. who wrote that, joe?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i wrote it myself, ma'am.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{now son, you tell 'em when it came from.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{be honest, i can't say i did it all myself. my grandma helped me get the words right.}
<A>__{oooo's and aah's and smiles and conversations erupting over each other. only we see, grace looking over to joe who gives her kickass, shy grin...}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(raising his beer)}
<D>__{well, i'd like to welcome annie and grace to their first branding...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{and next time, miss annie, you can run down the calves...}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i will drink to that...}
<A>__{everyone toasts and drinks. annie and tom exchange a look. she smiles, but not in a alluring way rather, in a grateful way. grateful for this brief moment of community and good feeling. and somehow, tom knows what she's feeling. no one notices this silent exchange except for diane, who sees everything that's going on.}
