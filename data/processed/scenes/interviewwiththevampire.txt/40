<L>__{exterior slave quarters night}
<A>__{the slaves, gathered on mass around fires. frenzied drumming, dancing. lestat rides through, scattering the flames. the drumming stops. the slaves look towards the house. slowly, they begin to move towards it.}

<D>__{we worry about you master. when do you ride about the fields? how long since you've been to the slave quarters? everywhere there is death. animals, men. are you our master still at all?}

<P>__{(dazed)}
<D>__{leave me alone now, yvette.}
<C>__{yvette}
<D>__{i will not go unless you listen to me. send away this new friend of yours. the slaves are frightened of him. they are frightened of you.}

<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i am frightened of myself, yvette.}
<A>__{he kisses her wrist. she suddenly gasps, sharply, withdraws her hand. she sees her wrist is red with blood. she sees the blood on his lips. she screams. louis stands.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{hush, yvette }
<A>__{she screams even louder. louis clamps his hand over her mouth. her hand grips the table cloth, pulls, bringing the empty glasses and crockery to the floor. in horror, louis realizes he has broken her neck. he brings her cut wrist to his lips, then drops it, revolted. he carries her body outside, grief stricken. the drumming grows louder.}
