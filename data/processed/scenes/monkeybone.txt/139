<C>__{julie}
<D>__{please. where did you take that man...?}
<A>__{the guard points to an animal control van. julie sees o.d. stu peering out through a small barred panel. their eyes meet...}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{who are you? why did you say those things?}
<C>__{o.d. stu}
<D>__{oh, doc, it's all a mixup. we were in the land of death. he stole my e ticket. that's how he got my body, see? all they had left for me was this corpse!}
<A>__{julie digests this, nods professionally, and turns to walk away.}
<C>__{o.d. stu}
<D>__{don't walk away, doc! he's only here to give people nightmares!}
<P>__{(no response)}
<D>__{doc! please! don't you remember the dream? they were pulling the plug i called out to you and you heard me. remember?}

<C>__{julie}
<D>__{buster?!?}

<C>__{o.d. stu}
<D>__{i meant to give it to you before. the night we crashed. i was so happy, julie, i...try to remember me like that, okay? not like this.}
<A>__{she slips the ring on her finger looks up at o.d. stu with tears welling in her eyes. he makes an odd snorkeling kind of noise.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{o.d. stu}
<D>__{i'm crying too. i just don't have any tears. i'm all dried up.}
