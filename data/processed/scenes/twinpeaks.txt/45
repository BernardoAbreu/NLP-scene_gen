<L>__{36. interior sam stanley's apartment, spokane day}
<A>__{all around the walls of stanley's apartment are work benches with adding machinery sitting on top of them. in the middle of the room is a portable plastic pool, with milky white water and crystallized salt formations clinging to the sides like quartz rocks. from one odd looking piece of machinery there are wires which extend into the pool. cooper's eyes go to the pool and back to stanley as sam talks about desmond.}
