<L>__{interior bobby's car}
<A>__{bobby and rosario are in the back seat. she looks through her pocketbook for some gum, he remains focused on the view through the windshield of his father's car. bobby's driver, vitt, follows burt down the streets. rain is falling frighteningly hard, to the point where the windshield wipers aren't moving fast enough for the water on the windshield. upsetting. visibility's terrible. the cars swing onto the kosciusko bridge loop. the traffic is sparse this early morning. we hear the thumpety thump of the bridge beams and the windshield wipers. and we hear the steady, haunting hum of the bridge surface beneath the wheels of the automobiles. bobby puts his arm around rosario, in the back seat. re the rain:}

<D>__{it's really coming down...}
<C>__{rosario diaz}
<D>__{bobby i think i left my watch at the hotel }
<A>__{bobby does not answer, instead spots an oldsmobile driving alongside his vehicle. seems a bit suspicious, the way it's moving...}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{hey vitt i think somethin's on our right!}
<C>__{vitt the guard}
<P>__{(turning)}
<D>__{huh ?}
<A>__{a flash! crack! a bullet punctures the windshield, but we don't hear the shot. the hole seems to appear almost out of nowhere. the windshield cracks down the middle... vitt is hit in the shoulder, and he lets out a piercing cry. blood hits the seat. rosario screams. bobby pushes her head down, into the back seat. the car starts to swerve. bobby climbs awkwardly over to the front seat. takes the wheel, forcefully pulling vitt to the side. to rosario:}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{get down!}
<A>__{rosario crouches, covers the back of her head with her hands. the water gets pushed away by the speedy wipers revealing: burt's car and the oldsmobile hitting each other, side to side; then, a hubcap we don't know from which car it's been dislodged... comes spinning at incredible speed. at bobby's windshield. right at bobby, right at us. we blink. bobby swerves. the hubcap skids off the front windshield. bobby brushes up against the guardrail. we see that it is all that protects him from spinning off into the river, two hundred feet below. bobby darts from lane to lane, and the third police car behind the olds has slammed on its brakes to avoid hitting bobby's car... the olds is right next to burt's car. bobby sees the barrel of the gun swing to burt. another big puddle a muffled thunderclap sound... the water slides away, revealing that the back window of burt's car has shattered. bobby is startled at this, his mouth momentarily drooping open. he can see: his father, firing his weapon out the window at the olds. we hear burt through the radio, a static ravaged signal:}
<C>__{burt's voice }
<D>__{they got a hit on! get support, now!}
<A>__{bobby pulls up alongside the olds. looks inside. he tries to get a good look but cannot. he sees two people in the car, one driving and one doing the shooting boom! and it punctures a hole in the side of bobby's rear door. rosario is jolted screams again...}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{rosario! you hurt?}
<A>__{she shakes her head, her face still buried in the vinyl. she's hysterical but physically unharmed. the traffic gets denser now. the weather is terrible, blinding. rushes of water cover the glass around the car, wrecking visibility. we are on: the b.q.e., with many trucks, big and small, on it. the olds weaves in and out, in front of and behind, many large semis. bobby watches as: burt's car is right behind the olds. this is unbelievably dangerous. a truck starts changing lanes. the olds scoots past it before it does, but: burt does not. the truck clips burt's car on the driver's side. he sneaks through, recovering and keeping up the pursuit. police cars, sirens blazing, join the pursuit... the truck starts to skid on the drenched roadway. then: it jacknifes, spinning out. the police car behind bobby's slams into the truck, making a macabre crunching sound. bobby's eyes, as he turns around and witnesses the horrific accident through the rain soaked rear window. it is}
