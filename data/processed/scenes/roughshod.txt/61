<T>__{dissolve:}
<L>__{exterior trail day}
<A>__{long shot. clay's cavalcade moves forward along the trail. there are cloud patches overhead and faintly in the back country thunder rumbles. the mules pull the jolting wagons forward in a slow trot. clay rides ahead. steve and the remuda follow.}
<T>__{dissolve:}
<L>__{exterior wyatt ranch day}
<A>__{full shot. lednov, mccall and peters ride into the yard and up to the horses' trough. the horses plunge their muzzles deep into the trough. as the men dismount, wyatt, a sinewy little man, hurries from the direction of the barn.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{at horse trough. wyatt, smiling his pleasure, comes up as the three men dismount.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<P>__{(happily)}
<D>__{my name's wyatt. certainly glad you boys dropped in.}
<A>__{he extends his hand to lednov. lednov ignores it. the three men are looking around them. two work horses, fat and elderly, amble across the corral to nuzzle the roans through the fence.}
<C>__{lednov}
<D>__{those the only horses you got?}
<A>__{wyatt is a little taken aback by lednov's manner.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{why, yes. they're all i need...}
<C>__{lednov}
<D>__{mine's gone lame. take a look at him.}
<A>__{wyatt frowns up at lednov, angered by the order.}
<C>__{lednov}
<D>__{go on, we haven't got all day.}
<A>__{mccall and peters move closer to wyatt, who glances around worriedly. realizing he better do as he's told, he goes to the roan and rubs his ears.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{whoa, boy. let's have a look.}
<A>__{bending, he lifts the horse's hoof. lednov, mccall and peters watch him. he drops the hoof, straightens.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{he dropped a shoe. you shouldn't be ridin' him.}
<C>__{lednov}
<D>__{put on another one.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{that won't help the stone bruise. you ain't been around horses much, looks like.}
<C>__{lednov}
<D>__{will you quit gabbin' and do what you're told.}
<A>__{wyatt hesitates. lednov steps toward him.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<P>__{(frightened, bewildered)}
<D>__{all right, but it won't do much good.}
<A>__{he picks up the roan's reins and starts leading him into the corral. lednov, with a jerk of his thumb, indicates that mccall is to go with him. mccall follows. lednov and peters turn toward the house.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{as lednov and peters start for the house, mrs. wyatt, a woman of about fifty, small, plump, browned from the sun and hard from work, comes out on the porch. she has taken off her apron and holds it in her hand. she smiles at the two men.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{angled past mrs. wyatt. she starts down the steps as lednov and peters come up.}
<C>__{mrs. wyatt}
<D>__{i was up to my elbows in flour when you boys rode up, that's why i din't come out sooner. i hope ed asked you to stay the night?}
<C>__{lednov}
<D>__{all we want's supper.}
<A>__{at his tone, the welcoming smile leaves her face. she looks from one to the other. lednov pushes past her up the steps and into the house. mrs. wyatt follows him with her glance. mccall motions.}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{we're in a hurry.}
