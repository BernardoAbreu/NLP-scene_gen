<A>__{reed checks data on a work station, set on a wall. the results of his calculations are not what he expected... he sees wind velocity digits rise. he does a double take when he sees the readout: event threshold, t minus 10:00.}

<D>__{no...no...impossible. it's...too fast.}

<A>__{behind his back, victor holds the ring box in hand.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{you've been with me two years now.}
<A>__{sue doesn't know where this is going. she treads lightly.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{it's been a good two years, victor... the company's accomplished so much.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{right, of course, the company... but you see, i've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with }
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{uh, victor, i hope i haven't done something to make you think...}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{sue, i've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. and this is the biggest step yet. if it helps, think of this as a promotion. a merger of sorts...}

<D>__{four little words that can change our lives...}
<A>__{he is about to spring the ring on her. she looks like a deer in headlights. she opens her mouth, and...wham! doors slam open. reed rushes into the room.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{the cloud is accelerating!}
<A>__{victor quickly puts the ring back in his pocket.}
<C>__{reed }
<D>__{i don't know what happened.}
<A>__{sue quickly moves to a nearby control panel to verify reed's claim. starts punching buttons. confirms reed's findings with a nod. victor hardens, in control.}
<C>__{reed }
<D>__{we've got minutes until it hits, not hours...victor, that storm's deadly the radiation's lethal. we need to abort.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{get a grip. reed. we didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. just close the shields...}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{ben's still out there }
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{so reel him in. but we came here to do a job. so let's do it. quickly.}
