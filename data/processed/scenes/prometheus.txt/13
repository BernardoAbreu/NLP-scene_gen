<L>__{exterior mediterranean sea day}
<A>__{a research vessel at anchor on a turquoise sea. bright sun. in the distance, a coastline dotted with villas. the horizon is dominated by the volcanic peak the same peak we saw in the distance in the prologue. aboard the research vessel, cranes lift watts and holloway's excavators out of the sea and onto the deck.}
<L>__{interior research vessel aft deck day}
<A>__{under an awning, prints of the obelisk's faces are stretched on the deck fifteen feet long. watts and holloway crawl over the alien text, red markers in hand. parsing, translating, calculating. they're tanned, fit, the wind in their hair. the mediterranean coast in the distance. it's an idyllic way to work. but they're utterly absorbed in the task at hand. aft deck night they're still at it. lights illuminate the workspace. the obelisk prints are blanketed with markings and annotations. holloway sits at a table. watts sits on the marked up prints. both working through calculations on electronic slates. holloway looks up.}

<D>__{i have a solution. a single match.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{me too. checked it twice.}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{you first.}
<A>__{watts holds up her slate: it displays a set of stellar coordinates. a detailed star map. holloway holds up his own slate: an exact match. they lock eyes in electric excitement.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{what do we do now?}
<C>__{holloway}
<D>__{we go there.}
