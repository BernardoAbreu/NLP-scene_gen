<A>__{black women day in the middle of a hymn. tirade.}
<C>__{bacon}
<D>__{this is a tragedy. a fine young man has been struck down. god fearing, church going, never in trouble, graduating from high school, ready for college and somebody comes along some rich white people in a rich white man's car and wham! they run him down and never even stop. now what are we going to do about these parking tickets?}
<A>__{pull back to include kramer, martin and goldberg. kramer is thrown.}
<C>__{kramer}
<D>__{well, uh... first of all, reverend ... is it reverend?}
<C>__{bacon}
<D>__{is, was, and always will be.}
<C>__{kramer}
<D>__{first of all, reverend, we have no evidence of...}
<C>__{bacon}
<D>__{this is your evidence...}
<B>__{angle to include mrs. annie lamb}
<A>__{coming up the aisle behind them.}
<C>__{kramer}
<D>__{oh, sorry, ma'am. i didn't see...}
<C>__{bacon}
<D>__{mrs. lamb is not speaking to the police. until we have proper counsel, i will speak for her.}
<C>__{kramer}
<D>__{alright, then. let me see if i have this straight. the boy was hit by a car...}
<C>__{bacon}
<D>__{on bruckner boulevard. innocently walking along, minding his own business... a clear case of hit and run.}
<C>__{kramer}
<D>__{no, reverend. i'm sorry. but you see, you have no witness. without a witness, there's no case of anything at all.}
<C>__{bacon}
<D>__{you got what he told his mother.}
<C>__{kramer}
<D>__{that's hearsay. you may believe it and i may believe it, but it's not admissable in a court of law.}
<C>__{bacon}
<D>__{if this boy was born on park avenue and he was run down by two niggers in a pontiac firebird, then you'd have a case! wouldn't you?!}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i work park avenue and i work bruckner boulevard, reverend. there's good and bad in both places. now we'll do everything we can for this lady. but we don't have a hell of a lot to go on.}
<C>__{bacon}
<D>__{gentlemen, i want you to make an investment here. an investment in steam control.}
<C>__{kramer}
<D>__{steam control?}
<C>__{bacon}
<D>__{that's right. steam control. because a righteous steam is building up in the souls of my people and that steam is ready to blow.}
<C>__{kramer}
<D>__{i see. well...}
<C>__{bacon}
<D>__{now, on judgment day, i am your safety valve. because when it blows and it will, my friend how grateful you will be that i am on your side the one nigger who can control the steam and save your lily white ass from being burned off the face of the earth so to speak.}
<C>__{kramer}
<D>__{you think this car was driven by a white man, huh?}
<C>__{bacon}
<D>__{i seldom think. i just plain know.}
<C>__{kramer}
<D>__{well, reverend. i will see what i can do.}
<A>__{kramer, martin and goldberg start to go. bacon puts his arm around mrs. lamb.}
<C>__{bacon}
<D>__{the next time you gentlemen hear from us, it will be through our lawyer.}
<A>__{mrs. lamb goes to kramer.}
<C>__{mrs. lamb}
<D>__{he said it started with an 'r.' that was the first letter. the second letter was an 'e' or a 'b' or maybe a 'p.' those were the first two letters of the license plate. if that's any help to you.}
