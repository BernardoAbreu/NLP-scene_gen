<A>__{marrow leads the way across the hall. the others check out the furnishings as they pass.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{these old victorian houses are great, aren't they?}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(points to details; adjust for set)}
<D>__{it's not victorian, everyone thinks that the whole nineteenth century was victorian. this is gothic, this is english craftsman, this is romanesque. this is... insane. who lives here?}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{nobody. a local mill owner, hugh crain, built it in 1830. he had no heirs, but he put the house in trust, and the farmland around it, with the stipulation that it never be altered or sold. crain's executors made good investments and for the last hundred and twenty years, hill house has taken care of itself.}
<A>__{mary is shaken by the house, but she's honoring marrow's request. everywhere she looks, she feels the presence of something.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{so what's this study all about anyway? mary described the kind of tests we'll be doing, but didn't fill us in on the big picture. she said you needed bad sleepers, but this wasn't about curing the problem.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i can tell you what this is about.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{eat first, questions later, mary, please.}
<A>__{they exit the hall, mary and nell last, and as they do, nell sees mary's strange look. she stops.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{is something wrong?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{no. just... when i saw your picture i had a feeling about you, and now that i meet you, i know i was right.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{eat first, questions later.}
<A>__{and suddenly awkward, mary exits after the others.}
