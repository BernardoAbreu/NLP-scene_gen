<C>__{danny }
<D>__{and so this is where i find myself. no. i should choose my words more wisely: this is the world i sought out. the land of the perpetual night party. day swallowing night and night swallowing day. the crank compressing time like some divine piston on its awesome downstroke.}
<A>__{danny's p.o.v. scanning the room. no sound. the girl's folding the socks ... kujo ranting on ... creeper and jimmy the finn grinding their jaws ... the blankets and tinfoil on the windows.}
<C>__{danny }
<D>__{we've been at this for three days ... or is it four? tweakerrs, lokers, slammers coming and going, swearing eternal allegiance and undying love for one another, only to wake up after the binge and realize you wouldn't walk across the street to piss on one of 'em if their head was on fire.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{is it three days or is it four?}
<A>__{back on danny. he blinks lethargically.}
<C>__{danny }
<D>__{i know what you're thinking. but don't give up on me just yet. and for god's sake, don't pity me. don't make any judgments until you've seen my whole story.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and keep your eyes open.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{nothing is what it seems.}
<A>__{suddenly ...}
<C>__{kujo }
<D>__{oh shit! we're out of drugs!}
