<L>__{139g. exterior mouse moon night}
<A>__{the moon continues to spew out pieces of moving images which are seen then disappear as fast as sparks. the broken, burning pieces float eerily toward us over the undulating dunes below. one image floats closer. it is a hand folded into a fist.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{i am only a seed...}
<A>__{the fist begins to open.}
<C>__{duke leto }
<D>__{the seed must grow.}
<A>__{the hand opens fully with slow blue fluid pulsating out the very center of the palm. the hand floats eerily forward.}
<C>__{duke leto }
<D>__{the sleeper must awaken.}
