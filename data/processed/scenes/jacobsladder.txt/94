<L>__{interior building corridor night}
<A>__{jacob gazes at jezzie for a moment and then hurries down the hall. he stops at the stairwell and looks back. jezzie is still standing there. she is very angry. jacob just stares at her for a moment and then disappears down the stairwell.}
<L>__{exterior westside highway night}
<A>__{jacob is standing near the westside highway. groups of men in black leather jackets are crusing the area and look at jacob with curiosity. one man in particular cruises by several times and then approaches him.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{jacob? hi. i'm michael newman. friends call me mike.}
<A>__{jacob is startled when he sees him. he is the same young man who has appeared throughout the film, assisting jacob in moments of crisis.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{surprised, huh? i told you you'd know me. i've been tracking you for a long time. i just wish i'd spoken to you before tonight.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i don't get it. who are you? why have you been following me?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{observation, mainly. clinical study. you were one of the survivors.}
<A>__{a police car passes them on the street. michael grabs jacob's shoulder and turns him away nervously.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{come on, we're not safe around here.}
<A>__{hudson river pier night jacob and michael are sitting on a deserted west side pier that juts into the hudson river. jacob is wide eyed as he listens to michael's story.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{so first i'm arrested, right? best lsd i ever made, right down the drain. i figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if i'm lucky. that was '68.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{long time ago.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(nodding his head)}
<D>__{next thing i know i'm on rikers island. ever been there?}
<P>__{(jacob shakes his head)}
<D>__{suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. they tell me if i will come to vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. well, i'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and i already knew that nam couldn't be any worse.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{shows how much you knew.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{no shit. they had me by the balls. next thing i know i'm in saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind altering drugs. not the street stuff mind you. they had us isolating special properties. the dark side, you know? they wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{yeah, sure. we were losing the war.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{right. they were worried. they figured you guys were too soft. they wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? and we did it. the most powerful thing i ever saw. even a bad trip, and i had my share, never compared to the fury of the ladder.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{the ladder?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{that's what they called it. a fast trip right down the ladder.}
<P>__{(he makes a downward dive with his hand)}
<D>__{right to the primal fear, the base anger. i'm tellin' you, it was powerful stuff. but i don't need to tell you. you know.}
<A>__{jacob can barely catch his breath, the information he is receiving is so powerful to his mind.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{we did experiments on jungle monkeys. they bashed each other's heads in, gouged out their eyes, chewed off their tails. the brass loved it. then they made us try it on charlie.}
<P>__{(he pauses)}
<D>__{they took these pow's, just kids really, and put 'em in a courtyard. we fed 'em huge doses of the stuff.}
<P>__{(he stops for a moment;}
<D>__{a tear rolls down his}
<P>__{cheek)}
<D>__{they were worse than the monkeys. i never knew men could do such things. the whole thing still blows me away.}
<A>__{michael stands up and begins walking in circles around the pier. jacob, astounded, gets up and walks beside him.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{anyway, this big offensive was coming up. everyone knew it; time magazine, huntley brinkley. and the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win. morale was down. it was gettin' ugly in the states. hell, you remember.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{like it was yesterday.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{a couple days later they decided to use the ladder, on one test battalion. yours. just in an infintessimal dose in the food supply, to prove its effectiveness in the field. they were sure your unit would have the highest kill ratio in the whole goddamn offensive. and you did, too. but not the way they tnought.}
<A>__{jacob is beginning to shake. michael pulls a container of pills out of his jacket pocket.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{hey, want something to calm you down? made 'em myself.}
<A>__{jacob shakes his head no.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{none of us can remember that night. i get flashes of it but they don't make sense. we saw shrinks for years. but nothing they did could ever touch it. what happened? was there ever an offensive?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{a couple of days later. it was fierce. you guys never saw it.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{but there was an attack. i can still see them coming. there was a fight, wasn't there?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{yeah. but not with the cong.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{who then?}
<A>__{he hesitates, obviously uncomfortable. his eyes grow puffy. he looks at the river for a moment and then turns to jacob.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you killed each other.}
<A>__{jacob's mouth drops open. the words hit him like a truck.}
