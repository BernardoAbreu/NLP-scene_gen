<D>__{some people say that opera is an acquired taste, but i don't believe it. you can always tell when someone goes to the opera for the first time. they either love it or hate it. those who love it will always love it; those who hate it might come to appreciate it, but they'll never truly love it.}
<A>__{vivian is wide eyed as they walk past a beautifully lit fountain with several graceful statues in its center. everywhere she looks she sees elegantly dressed women and prosperous looking men. it makes her nervous. without realizing it, she raises a protective hand up to her necklace. she looks as if she suspects someone is going to step up and steal it.}
