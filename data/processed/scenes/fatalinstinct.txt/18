<L>__{interior police station squad room night}
<A>__{ned and arch drag in a bunch of bad ass, multi ethnic gang members they've just busted. ned angrily shoves one of the toughest gang members against the wall... losing his cool.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{stand over there and shut up! gang member #1 hey, man, we got rights! don't you be layin' no deleterious malfeasance on us.}
<A>__{ned goes ballistic and slams him into the wall again!}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{watch your mouth, punk! i don't want to hear language like that!}
<A>__{arch grabs ned by the shoulder, pulling him back, calming him.}
<C>__{arch}
<D>__{whoa, hold on, hoss! take it easy. you seem a little tense tonight. what is it?}
<A>__{ned regains his composure. he's depressed.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{aw... i don't know. i guess it's lana. it's just... i know she wants to have a baby so bad...}
<A>__{gang member #1 steps closer, listening.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{...but i never get to spend any time with her. and when i am home... it's like she's, you know... avoiding sex.}
<A>__{gang member #1 steps closer, listening.}
<D>__{gang member #1 you should try to be more sensitive, man. more romantic. bring her flowers.}
<A>__{he steps between them, putting his arm around ned's shoulder.}
<D>__{gang member #1 try to understand how she feels. after all...}
<A>__{he steps back, begins to sing "try a little tenderness"...}
<D>__{gang member #1 she may be weary... women do get weary... wearing that same old shabby dress... but when she's weary... try a little ten der ness...}
<A>__{the other gang members join in on the second verse with a sweet, mellow street corner harmony as back up... and some smooth group choreography. the cops on duty listen raptly, getting maudlin and dewey eyed. tears roll down the cheeks of the booking sergeant. the lights dim. a big, gruff cop makes eyes at a hooker being booked... and they start to slow dance. arch watches all this with a sentimental smile, munching on his nachos. when the song ends, arch puts a comforting hand, covered with nacho cheese, on ned's shoulder.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{that can't be it. i'm the tenderest guy on the force. nah... i think she's just afraid she won't be able to get pregnant.}
<C>__{arch}
<D>__{what's to be afraid! it's like making breakfast! you bring home the bacon... she's got the eggs. ya scramble it up. ba da boom ba da bing! she's got an omelette in the oven!}
<P>__{(a beat, then)}
<D>__{why don't you knock off early... go home. it'd be nice for lana to wake up in the morning and find you there for a change.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{naw... i can't. i got all this paperwork.}
<C>__{arch}
<D>__{don't worry about that. gang member #1 we'll do our own paperwork, man!}
<C>__{other gang members}
<D>__{yeah! we'll fill out all that shit.}
<A>__{ned nods, smiles and gratefully "high fives" the gang members as he heads for the door.}
