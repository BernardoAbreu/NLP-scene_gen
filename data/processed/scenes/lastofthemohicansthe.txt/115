<A>__{being assembled, their hands shackled. hawkeye is among twelve or thirteen. he stands erect, walking out of the gate. the french are starting to pour in to loot the interior. hawkeye looks to his left about twenty paces in front of him and sees ... uncas & chingachgook on the other side of the column. chingachgook cradles killdeer as well as his own musket. they fall back to walk beside the prisoners on the other side of hawkeye. their eyes connect... we don't expect hawkeye to stay shackled for the duration.}
