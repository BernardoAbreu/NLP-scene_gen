<A>__{post lovemaking. rob and laura lie on their backs.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{c'mon. i want to know.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{want to know what, exactly?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{what it was like.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{it was like sex. what else could it be like?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{what's the difference?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{you know the difference.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{look, we're okay now. we just had a nice time. let's leave it at that.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{okay, that's cool, okay. but the nice time we just had... was it nicer, as nice, or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago?}
<A>__{laura is silent.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{oh, c'mon, laura. just say something. lie, if you want. it'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{well i was gonna lie and now i can't, because you'd know i was lying.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{to make you feel better.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{oh, great...}
<A>__{rob begins to get out of bed. she grabs his hand and pulls him back down.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{look, rob. if great sex was as important as you think it is, and if i was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. and that is my last word on the subject, okay?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{she pulls him close and they lie there, the matter seemingly settled.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i wish your penis was as big as his, though.}
<A>__{he turns slowly to her. a giggle from her turns into a laugh, then a howl, a roar }
