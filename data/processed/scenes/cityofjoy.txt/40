<A>__{arun begins to tear his shelter apart, and to heave the pieces at the babu, who retreats. others soon take up the call to vent their frustration, hurling things at the police and at the driver of the tractor. quickly we've got a full scale riot. the police wade into the crowd, pounding people with their sticks, arun one of the first to get hit. he staggers into hasari's arms. favoring pals arun and his family unbelievable! panic stricken, hasari and aloka gather the children and their few belongings... as beside them a woman goes down from a stick to the head; aloka stops instinctively to help the woman, but hasari grabs her, trying to shelter her and the children as well as arun's wife and children, clutching arun to him as in the chaos they manage to escape.}
