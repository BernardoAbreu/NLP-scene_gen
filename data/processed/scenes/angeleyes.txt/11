<L>__{exterior police jail parking lot day (later)}
<A>__{as robby and sharon walk to their car. they are interrupted by one of their lieutenants, sanderman, walking their way and stopping to stare at sharon. she meets his look.}
<C>__{sanderman}
<D>__{you trying to be a bad ass, pogue?}
<A>__{she is straightforward, not rebellious.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i just dealt with the situation. the prisoner...}
<C>__{sanderman}
<D>__{and you don't see a pattern here?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i want you to keep yourself way inside the line instead of walking on it. all right? are you taking notes?}
<A>__{he walks away, and sharon and robby walk on to their car she is dark; he is glancing at her.}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{you broke his nose.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{he grabbed me. end of story.}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{and you were waiting for him. you were hoping. you were making long range plans for his ass while he was mouthing off in the car and you're supposed to be above that shit.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{if you think i crossed the line, put it in the report.}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{pogo, stop the shit. what is it? you pissed off at me, too?}
<A>__{they enter the car, sharon behind the wheel.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{not you, rob. you're a rare unthreatened male cop with a good marriage, and you like to eat where i eat so everything's code four.}
<A>__{she starts the car and starts to back out, and he reaches over and turns off the ignition. she stares hotly at him but then, slowly, she softens, takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{come over for dinner tonight. i will call charlene. she'd like to see you. it's been awhile. we'll talk about it.}
<A>__{she starts the car again, more calm, starts to drive out of the lot.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{thanks. but she'll invite friends, try and fix me up. she's always trying to fix me up so she doesn't have to worry about you and me.}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{she doesn't worry about that.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{they all worry about that.}
<A>__{they both smile wryly, driving on.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{you don't need to fix me, robby, or fix me up. i don't want some guy to heart and soul me and then walk away 'cause he can't stand the cop thing or worse: he wants cop stories every night 'cause it turns him on, and he has no idea who i am inside my head. anyway, i'm busy tonight.}
<C>__{robby}
<D>__{got some action, huh? well, that's promising.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{yeah. hot and heavy.}
