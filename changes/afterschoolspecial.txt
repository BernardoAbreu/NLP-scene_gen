<LOC>__{INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY}
<ACTION>__{The sounds echo in the empty hall. Behind the stage a light from an open door...}
<CHAR>__{MATT } <CHAR_PAR>__{(O.S.)}
<DIAL>__{This is unwatchable. It's not even in focus. And geez, look, the boom mike is in the shot. This is really shoddy work.}
<LOC>__{INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - A/V ROOM   - DAY}
<ACTION>__{The door leads into this room, as we continue on to a TV MONITOR displaying a sweaty guy's ugly face.}
<CHAR>__{DEACON } <CHAR_PAR>__{(O.S.)}
<DIAL>__{Why do they always show the guy's face? It's like, can't we just assume he's enjoying it?}
<ACTION>__{We slowly PULL BACK from the TV.}
<CHAR>__{FRED } <CHAR_PAR>__{(O.S.)}
<DIAL>__{Because they're trying to make us feel like we're better looking than that guy, so we should be able to get chicks as hot as her.}
<CHAR>__{DEACON } <CHAR_PAR>__{(O.S.)}
<DIAL>__{How the hell do you know?}
<CHAR>__{FRED } <CHAR_PAR>__{(O.S.)}
<DIAL>__{It's a basic rule of porno.}

<LOC>__{INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - A/V ROOM - DAY}
<ACTION>__{... before school with the sound turned way down, but you can still hear the porno. The three guys are sitting with their book bags on their laps to conceal any possible bonerage.}
<CHAR>__{DEACON } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{It all started on my seventeenth birthday with our usual morning routine: film appreciation. The school bell RINGS and Deacon clicks off the TV.}
<CHAR>__{FRED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Deacon! What are you doing? I was watching that.}
<CHAR>__{DEACON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Come on, let's go. We're going to be late. DEACON (V.O.) (CONT'D) And when I say film appreciation, I mean film duplication. Fred steals them, Matt copies them, and I sell them. Matt walks over to the TV and presses eject on five VCR's. The original plus four copies pop out. CLOSE ON the original tape: "Ramalot Productions presents Dirty Darla #7," as Matt hands it to Fred and the copies to Deacon. They smile.}

<DIAL>__{The guys are waiting in line for lunch.}
<CHAR>__{DEACON } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{Fred's the kind of kid who's basically given up on high school. He figures his glory days are way ahead of him.}
<CHAR>__{FRED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{First, I go to Yale, then Harvard law, then when I'm making a hundred grand a year, I'll have a whole stable of hot chicks sitting around topless on my yacht. He smiles ears to ear, looking for approval.}

<DIAL>__{What?}
<LOC>__{INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY}
<DIAL>__{The video monitors up and down the hallways display an image that reads "Fifteen Days Till Midterms." Fred sees two AMAZING GIRLS walking towards him.}

<DIAL>__{Until that big payday, Fred's sex life consists of spanking it.}
<CHAR>__{AMAZING GIRL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<LOC>__{INT. BOYS' BATHROOM - DAY}
<DIAL>__{Fred looks under the stalls to make sure no one's in there, then enters a stall and locks the door. He puts his book bag down, then places a protector on the toilet seat and sits down. He pulls a large wad of toilet paper off the roll. Then, from out of the book bag, Fred pulls a bottle of Moisty-Mate hand lotion. He smiles.}
<LOC>__{INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY}
<DIAL>__{Fred is walking to class when he spots a HOT GIRL, rubbing a stain off of her shirt. Another HOT GIRL grabs her arm.}

<CHAR>__{DEACON } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{Now Matt-- Matt's what you'd call a late bloomer. Secretary of the Audio Visual Club, amateur filmmaker, and complete dork.}
<ACTION>__{J.T. and Mark grab Matt's camera and film each other flipping him off. Matt grabs it back and the Twins walk away laughing. Fred shakes his head.}
<CHAR>__{FRED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What are you doing?}
<CHAR>__{MATT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{All great directors start this way. I'm documenting the essence of high school. Teenagers running to meet their destiny only to find it's just home room. It's very existential.}
<CHAR>__{FRED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{So's my balls. See you later.}

<CHAR>__{DEACON } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{In the normal course of things, Matt probably wouldn't even have been our friend, but Fred likes having someone to boss around, and I think Matt's actually pretty cool once you get to know him.}
<ACTION>__{Just then, the burly GIRLS' SWIM TEAM COACH comes out of the girls' locker room. She walks by Matt without noticing, and the door to the locker room closes slowly. Matt's attention is drawn to it. The door stops with a CREAK, a sliver of daylight still visible. Matt shakes his head and starts to walk away towards the boys' locker room. Then, he stops. He's torn. He's still too immature to really be interested, but he thinks he should be. He looks around quickly, then slowly approaches the door. He turns his head sideways, and places it up against the crack. MATT'S POV The proverbial jackpot. Teenage girls changing. Bras. Panties. Towels...}
<ACTION_ALT>__{REVERSE ANGLE}
<ACTION>__{Matt's eyes widen. And then, they CLOSE TIGHT. He quickly scurries away.}

<CHAR>__{DORKY FRESHMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sweet.}
<ACTION>__{He hands him the money and Deacon makes the exchange for the tape. The freshman clutches it like gold and scurries away. Deacon heads out down the hallway towards his locker. He sees a gaggle of teenage GIRLS gossiping.}
<CHAR>__{DEACON } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{People always talk about how tough it is being a teenage girl. I mean, if I have to watch one more TV movie about bulimia or self mutilation or vaginal dryness...}
<ACTION>__{Deacon reaches his locker and opens it. He sees some CHEERLEADERS bouncing down the hallway. Deacon takes out some books for class.}
<DIAL>__{DEACON (CONT'D; V.O.) (CONT'D) I'll tell you what's really hard. Being a seventeen year old boy. Imagine what it's like to have only one thing on your mind all day, every day, but to have absolutely no way of getting it.}
<LOC>__{INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY}

<CHAR>__{DEACON } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{Testosterone is a drug more powerful than heroin. I don't really have any evidence to support that, but the point is, a horny teenage boy will do almost anything for even a glimpse of sex.}
<ACTION>__{... his BIOLOGY TEACHER's erect NIPPLES visible through her conservative bra and blouse. Aside from her flashing headlights, she's the kind of woman you wouldn't notice even if you were alone with her on a two-man luge. But that doesn't matter-- Deacon can't take his eyes off of them.}

<DIAL>__{I have a math test tomorrow.}

<ACTION>__{Deacon is suddenly...}
<LOC>__{INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY}

<CHAR>__{FRED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm biding my time.}
<CHAR>__{DEACON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Whatever. It just wasn't good timing.}
<CHAR>__{FRED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{That's not going to be us this year, or next year, or any year, ever.}
<CHAR>__{DEACON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Why not? All we have to do is follow the simple lessons of Tony Montana in "Scar Face."}

<DIAL>__{So, we're going to become Cuban drug lords?}
<CHAR>__{DEACON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Listen, the porno pirating operation is bringing in plenty of money. When I get my new car tonight for my birthday, we'll have the power to go wherever we want. Then, there's nothing stopping us from getting the girls.}
<ACTION>__{Fred and Matt look at Deacon warily. Is this a plan? Then, the hot girls and Jake drive past the guys.}
<CHAR>__{JAKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Bye, Sphincter!}
<ACTION>__{They laugh, then peel out with the radio blasting.}
<CHAR>__{FRED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Nothing's going to change, Deacon. You're still going to be the kid who shit his pants in fifth grade and no one will ever let you forget it.}
