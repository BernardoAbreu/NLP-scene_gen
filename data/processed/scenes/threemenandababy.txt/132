<C>__{natalie}
<P>__{(in a bad mood)}
<D>__{oh, my feet are killing me!}
<A>__{she takes off her shoes and collapses in the armchair in the hall. there is a loud squeaking noise. she reaches underneath her and brings out a rubber giraffe.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{what the hell is this? oh, it's a giraffe...}
<P>__{(tosses it away and walks off)}
<D>__{... oh, by the way, have you heard anything about that kid, you know, the one you had here for a while?}
<A>__{peter stares at the giraffe, horrified. he feels the tears coming to his eyes. grabbing the giraffe, he hurls it with all his might against the wall.}
