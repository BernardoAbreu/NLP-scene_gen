<L>__{interior cleveland athletic club night}
<A>__{lynn comes out of the dressing room into the pool area, deserted this time of night. she wears a racing suit, but lets her hair hang free. the pool glows like a sheet of emerald glass. she shakes down a beat, curls her toes around the coping, slowly bends at the waist, and then launches into a full out racing dive. we watch as she swims a 100 yard individual medley; first the butterfly, then the backstroke, breaststroke and finally freestyle. we condense the time, of course, shooting some underwater, some slo mo, as she knives through the water, her hair flowing behind her, an athlete alone with her medium. the sequence should convey not only the grace of her strokes and her athletic ability, but the fluid beauty of swimming, its synthesis of power and form. as she begins the freestyle leg, another body appears in the pool next to her. it's jake, and he's racing her the final lap. she immediately responds to the challenge, digging harder, picking up her kick. they go neck and neck for 20 yards, but lynn has one more gear and touches him by half a body length at the wall. both are winded.}
