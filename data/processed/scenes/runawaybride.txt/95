<L>__{interior bridal shop day}
<A>__{the place is fairly large and prosperous, probably the place to go in the tri county area. a little flower girl, 10, is being fitted on the pedestal in the middle of the room. a saleswoman, polly, has taken the flower girl under her wing. they are both under the expert eyes of a stern looking woman, mrs. whittenmeyer, the shop owner. also, the girl's mother is there watching.}
<C>__{polly}
<P>__{(to the mother)}
<A>__{she'll be the prettiest little flower girl in your daughter's wedding.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{mr. whittenmeyer. hi, polly! the flower girl sees maggie and runs and hides behind polly.}
<C>__{polly}
<A>__{hi, maggie. you'll have to excuse her, maggie. some of the children are afraid of you since you dragged that little boy up the aisle.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{i didn't drag.}
<P>__{(then to the girl)}
<A>__{he tripped on his shoelaces. mrs. whittenmeyer comes forward to greet maggie.}
<C>__{mrs. whittenmeyer}
<A>__{you've come for your dress. good! i will get it from the back. maggie leads her to the front window.}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(happily)}
<A>__{actually, i would like to get this dress. she points to the dress. she smiles back to mrs. whittenmeyer, expecting her to share her joy. mrs. whittenmeyer darkens.}
<C>__{mrs. whittenmeyer}
<P>__{(to polly)}
<A>__{polly, take leslie into change.}
<P>__{(then, to maggie)}
<A>__{but the one you have on hold is lovely.}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(pleasantly)}
<A>__{yes. but i've changed my mind.}
<C>__{mrs. whittenmeyer}
<A>__{it's one thousand dollars. maggie is keenly aware of ike listening in.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{i have one thousand dollars.}
<C>__{mrs. whittenmeyer}
<P>__{(firmly)}
<A>__{the other one is only three hundred dollars. maggie lowers her voice, hoping to lessen the humiliation of the moment.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{is this dress for sale?}
<C>__{mrs. whittenmeyer}
<A>__{it just seems like an awful lot of money to spend on one of your dresses, maggie... you only wear them for about ten minutes. ike watches with regret as maggie's child like enthusiasm drains away, her happy mood crushed by the tactless assault of the shop owner. he's starting to see that it's no always easy being maggie. there's a tremor in her voice.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{yeah, that's a good pointerior}
<P>__{(then, sitting)}
<A>__{the other dress is nice. ike calls out to mrs. whittenmeyer.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{mrs. whittenmeyer. may i talk to you for a second? she walks over to him.}
<C>__{ike }
<A>__{i don't know much about this kind of thing. i'm from out of town. you're a salesperson, right? you're here to sell wedding dresses.}
<C>__{mrs. whittenmeyer}
<P>__{(huffy)}
<A>__{yes. i've been here for thirty years.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{perfect. because miss carpenter is here to buy one. but not just any one. she wants that one.}
<C>__{mrs. whittenmeyer}
<A>__{it's a thousand dollars! ike goes over and takes the mannequin out of the window. mrs. whittenmeyer catches the wig as he puts the mannequin under his arm.}
<C>__{ike }
<A>__{look, aunt bea, we're buying this beautiful dress and anything else she wants or i'm coming back here with a squirt gun filled with india ink. mrs. whittenmeyer wilts under ike's fierce gaze. she turns to maggie.}
<C>__{mrs. whittenmeyer}
<A>__{will he really do that? maggie gives her a look.}
<C>__{mr. whittenmeyer }
<P>__{(to maggie)}
<A>__{well, why don't you pick out some accessories while i get this ready, dear. polly, will you come help me, please? polly comes to help carry the mannequin away. angle on polly and mrs. whittenmeyer:}
<C>__{polly}
<P>__{(whispering to mrs. whittenmeyer)}
<A>__{it's a thousand dollars.}
<C>__{mrs. whittenmeyer}
<A>__{shhhh! the man has ink! maggie looks gratefully at ike.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{tough to spend money in this town. time cut: a few minutes later: ike sits as he hears maggie's voice behind him.}
<C>__{maggie }
<A>__{what do you think? ike turns around. maggie is standing on the pedestal, wearing the dress and looking unbelievably gorgeous. she is overwhelming to behold and ike has to struggle to keep his face under control.}
<C>__{ike}
<P>__{(stammering)}
<A>__{you look... uh... you look fine.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{fine. the newspaper's upside down. that's better than fine.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{bob will be very happy. she glows. then the moment between them is broken as she suddenly remembers something and grabs the veil off her head.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{bob! i almost forgot! i have to meet bob!}
