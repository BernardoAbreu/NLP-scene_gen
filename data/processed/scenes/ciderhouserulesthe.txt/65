<L>__{exterior driveway afternoon}
<A>__{as homer puts his stuff in the truck of wally's car, angela can't resist touching his face. she is too upset to speak. from a window, larch is watching the departure. he sees homer saying goodbye to the children, embracing them. from another window, fuzzy just stares. (of course he's coughing.) we see wally carrying candy to the car.}

<C>__{candy}
<D>__{no keep it down. i want to feel the air.}
<A>__{she speaks to homer, touching his sleeve, like a sleepy person, as wally puts her gently in the backseat.}

<P>__{(still groggy)}
<D>__{coming with us? it's always a good idea to have a doctor along for the ride.}
<A>__{homer gets in the passenger seat beside wally, who starts the car; suddenly there is curly. homer can't look at curly, who looks betrayed. edna picks up curly and carries him to the passenger side window. curly is sobbing.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{i have to go, curly. i'm sorry.}
<P>__{(to edna)}
<D>__{i couldn't find buster. will you tell him...}
<A>__{he can't finish what he has to say. edna kisses him good bye. from the window, larch watches the car leave. buster, whittling a stick, isn't watching.}
