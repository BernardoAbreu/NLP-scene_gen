<A>__{he walks up rickety stairs, into a small room with five or six tables. empty. dirty. he sits and waits. a clock ticks on the wall midnight. white coughs, for attention. a noise from a doorway. a shadow moves towards him, dragging one foot as it walks. a small asian woman appears and limps to his table. she speaks very quickly in chinese. he does not understand. she points to a chalk board on the wall a list of dishes also in chinese, only one in english the last one. at the bottom. in small printerior "noodles".}
<C>__{white }
<D>__{the noodles. iill have some noodles.}
<A>__{the old woman rips a yellow ticket from a pad, gives it to white. a number on it. she points her crooked finger again at a speaker box above a small serving window in the wall. a greenish fluoro pulses from the room within.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{we call.}
<A>__{she leaves again. white looks about the empty room. insects are zapped on an illuminated device hanging on the wall. an old air conditioner rattles noisily. noises from the kitchen voices argue in chinese, a baby cries. then silence. white removes the newspaper from his coat and spreads it on the table. he overcomes his fear, starts to read the article. leans forward, hands trembling. without realising, he holds the paper over a candle burning on the table. the paper catches fire, is engulfed. he drops the flaming page on the table. now the table cloth starts to burn. white is frantic. on a nearby table he finds a pitcher of water, and dumps this on the flames. it kills the fire but leaves a black hole in the table cloth. the paper is ash. he moves to another table pretending nothing happened, fans the smoke away.}
