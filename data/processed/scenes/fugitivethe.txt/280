<A>__{gerard fires seven times in two seconds. kimble goes down. shots and screams echo around the lobby. a long beat, then gerard rises. through glass studded with bullet holes, he sees... kimble rising... staring back. equally astounded that he's alive. he runs free.}

<D>__{open the doors!}
<A>__{gerard pounds against the doors. sees cratering in the glass and then sees flattened slugs all over the floor. it's bullet proof glass. through the glass he sees kimble rush across the street and disappear into the parade. doors open and gerard and his men follow. but kimble has disappeared into the parade celebrations outside. blending in with the marchers.}
