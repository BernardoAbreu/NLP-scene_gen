<C>__{dan }
<D>__{don't you fucking let her look.}
<A>__{lynch is trying to cover parker's ears...but she can hear what they are saying. she forces her head free and steals a glance down. she sees dan's untimely death approaching and instantly starts to scream and cry. lynch holds her head in a vice grip. he presses his forehead into hers. her tears and snot overflow onto his gloves.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{shhhh. don't listen to it. don't listen. don't listen.}
<A>__{as we push in tight on the two of their faces, below them we hear the wolves begin their attack on their defenseless prey. first one growl and a bite. dan shrieks in pain.}
<C>__{dan }
<D>__{don't let her look!}
<A>__{below we can hear him put up a fight. but the attacks and bites get more frequent and his screams even more painful.}
<D>__{dan (o.c.) (cont'd) don't look! don't you fucking look down here!}
<A>__{the sound of several wolves attacking in unison over powers his cries. lynch continues to hold his hands over parker's ears and keep her eyes pointed at his as the sounds of dan's demise echo through the night. the sounds of clothes being shredded, flesh being torn, and bones popping from their joints creates a chorus of pain below. dan doesn't scream as much as does cry out in pain and agony. the camera never sees it. only lynch and parker's faces. after what seems to be an unbearable minute...the sounds from below begin to dissipate. eventually dan's remains can be heard dragging away. silence once again. finally, lynch let's go of parker's head. he sobs into his own frozen gloves as parker hysterically screams out into the night.}
