<A>__{pairs of bloody red legs hanging still, high in the air. pulling back, we discover: a dozen spaniards have been crucified on the scaffolding of the excavations. some hands and noses have been removed. utapan is standing, uncomfortable among the spaniards. a soldier removes a huge iron nail from a wrist. one of the crucified bodies is gently laid on the ground. he is still alive not for long. columbus and bartolome are silent with rage.}

<D>__{moxica is right. our ways don't work!}
<A>__{bartolome turns to utapan.}
<C>__{bartolome}
<P>__{(aggressively)}
<D>__{can you find them?}
<A>__{utapan looks distraught this is the first time he is being asked to do something against his own people. he looks up at columbus for help in confusion.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{you have to find them, utapan. look what they did!}
<C>__{utapan}
<D>__{you did the same to your god!}
<A>__{columbus is caught short.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{we have to stop this war.}
<A>__{utapan nods. he walks and takes an arrow. he examines it.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{do you know them?}
<A>__{utapan nods, uncomfortable.}
