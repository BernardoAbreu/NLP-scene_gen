<L>__{interior old mine night}
<A>__{the solar car proceeds along the tunnel. it enters an area full of smoke. dozens of men are sitting around smoking cigarettes, pipes and cigars. quail looks at them in amazement.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{what's all this?}
<C>__{bennie}
<D>__{nothin', boss. just old smokies. only place they can come for a puff. it's all banned topside.}
<A>__{they have now climbed out of the car. quail looks searchingly at melina and bennie.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{so you two are into something a bit more serious than the taxi and truck stop business.}
<C>__{bennie}
<D>__{that's right, boss.}
<A>__{he unzips his jacket to reveal a t shirt with "martian liberation front" (and an appropriate symbol) emblazoned on it.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{my god!... t shirts. they died out on earth years ago.}
<C>__{bennie}
<P>__{(hurt)}
<D>__{well, maybe we ain't fashion leaders, boss.}
<C>__{melina}
<D>__{no. but we still believe in a free mars.}
<A>__{they walk as they talk into a room off the main tunnel. it is adorned with "free mars" and "martian liberation front" posters. a group of people are printing t shirts and leaflets. they exchange greetings with melina and bennie.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{so where did i fit into all this?}
<C>__{melina}
<D>__{you when you were charles hauser with e.i.o infiltrated our group. i guess cohaagen didn't trust you any more when you and i...}
<A>__{her gesture suggests their liaison.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{yeah. and i can't even remember it. we'll have to arrange a return bout.}
<C>__{melina}
<D>__{...so he had your memory wiped and fixed you up with a new identity.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{but the sphinx. why is that stuck in my mind? why's it so important?}
<C>__{melina}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{bennie}
<D>__{just an ole heap o' stone, boss.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{it's more than that, bennie, i know it's more. somehow it's connected.}
<A>__{he slumps into a chair with frustration.}
<C>__{melina}
<P>__{(reflecting)}
<D>__{maybe there's a way you can get your memory back.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{how? what? where? when?}
<C>__{melina}
<D>__{a bit of martian wisdom. we're not all stupid colonists.}
