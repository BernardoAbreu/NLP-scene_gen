<L>__{interior restaurant evening}
<A>__{malcolm hurriedly enters a spacious, dimly lit italian restaurant. he stops in the dining room and searches the many candle lit tables. he finds anna. anna sits alone at a corner table. the remains of her half eaten dinner lay on the only place setting on the table. a small piece of cake with a candle in it sits untouched. anna stirs sugar in her coffee as malcolm sits in the seat across from her. she gently stops stirring, but doesn't look up. beat.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i thought you meant the other italian restaurant i asked you to marry me in.}
<A>__{anna isn't laughing. not even close.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i'm so sorry.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i can't seem to keep track of time.}
<A>__{anna quietly takes a sip from her coffee.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{it didn't go well today. spent some time after trying to get my head together.}
<A>__{anna looks around for the waiter.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{they're so similar, anna. they have the same mannerisms. the same expressions. the same thing hanging over them.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it might be some kind of abuse.}
<A>__{that makes anna turn back. she glances across the table, then looks down.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{there are cuts on cole's arms. fingernail marks, i think. looks like defensive cuts.}
<A>__{malcolm demonstrates by holding up his arm to shield his face.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{possibly a teacher, neighbor.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i don't think it's the mother. just a gut thing. the way she deals with him. it doesn't fit.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{hard to say this early. could just be a child climbing a lot of trees.}
<A>__{malcolm loses himself in his thoughts. the waiter drops off the check on the table. anna grabs it before malcolm and quickly signs it.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i know i've been kind of out of it for a long while and you resent it. you do. i know you're mad. i know it's put some distance between us.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{but i'm getting a second chance here. i can't let it slip away.}
<A>__{anna waits till he's done and rises from the table. she pushes her chair in hard and walks away without a word. malcolm sits alone and stares at the piece of cake with a candle on it.}

<P>__{(soft)}
<D>__{...happy anniversary.}
