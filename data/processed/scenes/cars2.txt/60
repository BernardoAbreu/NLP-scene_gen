<A>__{mater he watches this from a safe hiding spot around a corner.}
<C>__{finn }
<D>__{get ready, mater.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{finn, at an outdoor cafe on the casino grounds.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{you're on any moment now.}
<T>__{cut back to:}
<A>__{mater, now looking a bit nervous. he backs out of sight.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{i don't know about this, finn. what if i screw things up?}
<C>__{finn }
<D>__{impossible. just apply the same level of dedication you've been using to play the "idiot tow truck" and you'll be fine.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{it's just that them guys look pretty tough and wait, did you say "idiot"? is that how you see me?}
<C>__{finn }
<D>__{that's how everyone sees you. isn't that the idea? i tell you, that's the genius of it. no one realizes they're being fooled because they're too busy laughing at the fool. brilliant.}
<A>__{while finn talks, mater takes this in. he catches his own reflection in a nearby window. seems to be seeing himself with new eyes. zzzzattt! mater jumps at the sound, turns in time to see ivan shocked unconscious by holley's zappers.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{why aren't you in disguise?}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{i, uh }
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{come on, there's no time. go!}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{okay, okay. computer: disguise.}
<C>__{mater's computer}
<D>__{request acknowledged.}
