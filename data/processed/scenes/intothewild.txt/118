<A>__{wayne's truck cuts through a track in a wheat field moving toward a compound of three trailers, one a double wide, the other two on wheels, smaller. beside them, a wyeth esque farmhouse. he eases the engine and comes to a stop in front of the double wide. as he and chris dismount the truck, wayne gives him a hushing finger across the lips. they tip toe up to the door, where wayne shuffles a bunch of keys. a little thunder kicking in the distant sky.}
