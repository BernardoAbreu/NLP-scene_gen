<L>__{interior jack's office day}
<A>__{sam goes through the glass door and is about to push open the double doors in front of him. he is halted by a noise from the typist she indicates that he is to go to the left. he does so and enters an office. an antique desk with a large collection of executive toys and other tastefully reassuring furniture fill the room which is a rather oddly shaped ... distorted as it by the curved wall of the much larger room that sam was stopped from entering. nevertheless the feel of the room is confidently successful. a buzzing noise draws sam's attention to the wash basin in the far corner. the information retrieval technician is standing by a sink massing his temples with old fashioned scalp vibrators. his back to us.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{excuse me. are you officer 412 l?}
<A>__{the technician makes no sign of having heard this. he continues vibrating his temples.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(a bit louder)}
<D>__{er, excuse me!}
<A>__{getting no response sam walks over to the technician. as he passes the desk he notices a strange mask lying face down on the desk top. it seems strangely familiar but as it is a negative concave image sam isn't sure. he continues over to the technician.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{he touches the technician on the shoulder, who jumps with a start. he spins around and turns out to be none other than jack linterior he is amazed to see sam.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{jack!!}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(recovering slightly)}
<D>__{sam! what a surprise!}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(even more surprised)}
<D>__{are you officer 412 l?}
<A>__{jack looks confused. he pauses, and then removes ear plugs.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(shaking sam's hand)}
<D>__{sorry about that ... mr helpmann told me you were coming aboard congratulations!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{thanks. are you officer 412 l?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{for my sins. are you settling in alright?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yes, thanks.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{terrific. i'm really glad you dropped by. unfortunately, i don't have any time right now i've got a queue of customers to deal with er, why don't we have a drink tonight?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(diffidently)}
<D>__{ah ...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i don't want to take up your time now, but i was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. it's a security level three matter and information retrieval records says to refer to you.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{ok. come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. if you give me the number of the case, i will have the dossier here waiting.}
<P>__{(he pulls card from his}
<D>__{pocket pushes it towards}
<P>__{sam)}
<D>__{my tailor,... well worth the investment.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(taking print out sheets from his pocket)}
<D>__{i've got numbers all over these i'm not sure which is the one you want.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(looking at the print out}
<D>__{picture of jill over sam's}
<P>__{shoulder)}
<D>__{layton! oh shit!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you clever bastard! i might have guessed. you only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.}
<C>__{sam}
<A>__{am i?}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{please, sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. if you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{how do you mean?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how much do you know?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{not much.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{enough though, eh?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(getting sucked into this exchange)}
<D>__{not really, no.}
<A>__{jack goes over to the sink and turns on the taps full blast, splashing the water noisily into the basin.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{ok. ok. let's not fence around ... this is the situation. some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused two of our clients, b58 732 and t47 215.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{b58 732, that's a. buttle isn't it?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{christ! you do know it all!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no, no, i don't. i'm just beginning honestly. sorry, carry on.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well, your a. buttle has been confused with t47 215, an a. tuttle. i mean, it's a joke! somebody should be shot for that. so b58 732 was pulled in by mistake.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you got the wrong man.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(a little heated)}
<D>__{i did not get the wrong man. i got the right man. the wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! i accepted him, on trust, as the right man. was i wrong? anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you killed him?}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but buttle's heart condition did not appear on tuttle's file. don't think i'm dismissing this business, sam. i've lost a week's sleep over it already.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm sure you have}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{there are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank god there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. we've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip up like this is just the chance they're looking for.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{so how ...?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what i've got to do now is pick up tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what has tuttle done?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{we suspect him of freelance subversion.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(dumbly)}
<D>__{he's a freelance subversive?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{he's a compulsive heating engineer. a maverick ex central service repair man with a grudge against society. now, fortunately, we're nearly out of the wood, i think. at least we will be when i get this layton woman under arrest.}
<A>__{jack turns off taps and goes behind screen.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(agitated)}
<D>__{what's she done?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{er ... no.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{very smart.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{er ... but i would've found out anyway.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yes. i'm impressed.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(playing the game)}
<D>__{tell me about layton.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{she witnessed the tuttle arrest the buttle arrest and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{a terrorist?}
<A>__{jack comes from behind the screen with a look confirming just what sam fears, and hands him a suit.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{ah ... thanks.}
<A>__{sam begins to put the suit on.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(hesitantly)}
<D>__{but surely, i mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the buttles, and ...}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(picking up photograph of}
<D>__{wife and kids from his}
<P>__{desk)}
<D>__{look after that suit, eh. barbara chose it for me.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{right. er, you're not going to keep calling her barbara, are you?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(preferring to let his drop)}
<D>__{look, about the layton woman maybe she's just trying to help the buttle family.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{why? hell, not for any reason ...}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{{baffled)}
<D>__{i don't follow you.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{out of kindness.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(utterly baffled)}
<D>__{kindness? what's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(deciding to abandon this line of country)}
<D>__{so what are you going to do about her?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{get her out of circulation i've put her on the detention list.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(thinking fast)}
<D>__{you mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(taken aback)}
<D>__{well, i ... good pointerior what do you suggest?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{let me try to get to her. i will deactivate her.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what does that mean? i don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{trust me. you do trust me, don't you?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{of course. we went to school together. you're my oldest friend.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{and you're mine.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you're the only person i can trust.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{right! just between as and the security forces.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{they weren't at school with us.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{but, i've already put her on the search and detain list.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{take her off the list.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{there's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{say it was a mistake.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{we don't make mistakes.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{well, i'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. let me borrow her dossier for a while.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{er ... alright. for christ's sake don't lose it. here, you'd better sign for it.}
<A>__{jack presents sam with something to sign. he then gives him the dossier.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{thanks, jack. i will be in touch.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{do you know what you're doing.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(about to say no, then pauses)}
<D>__{trust me.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(admiring sam's new look)}
<D>__{sam ... we're proud to have you at information retrieval. merry xmas.}
<P>__{(he hands sam another executive package)}
