<D>__{dad, do you suppose i could have a chemistry lab in the basement?}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(preoccupied with mail)}
<D>__{sure, why not?}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{i think it's awful. smelling up the house with those horrible chemicals.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{never mind, betsy.}

<D>__{i mean that every time i turn my back bill cole's driving you some place or something.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{he's only being helpful.}

<C>__{jim}
<D>__{we'll just see about that!}
