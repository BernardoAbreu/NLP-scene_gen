<A>__{bursting into the corridor, sandra sees ellen racing toward her, weaving through broken beams, screaming as caine 607 lumbers after her out of the shadows. caine 607 doesn't bother to avoid obstacles, shoving beams aside like twigs, dragging his bad leg.}

<A>__{ellen dives into sandra's arms and sandra turns, only three steps ahead of caine 607, and rushes into the meeting room.}
<L>__{interior meeting room}
<A>__{todd is just putting nathan gently on the floor when he sees caine 607 arrive in the doorway. for halt a second their eyes meet, then caine 607 advances on todd. still encumbered by children clutching at him, todd sees his weapons, but can't get to them. then it's too late! the terrified children watch as the giant caine 607 clubs todd mercilessly with the rifle butt, then hurls him backwards like a rag doll. horrified, sandra sees todd slam into a wall, slump to the floor. dismissing todd, caine 607 turns, looms toward the children.}

<D>__{they're just children!}
<A>__{caine 607 ignores her, heads for ellen, dragging his bad leg. spotting todd's weapons, sandra snatches a heavy rocket rifle, brings it up awkwardly, points it, fires! and the kick from the heavy gun sends sandra sprawling back, the weapon trembling from her hands. but the whizzing rocket, a near miss, gets caine 607's attention. he turns away from ellen, toward sandra. angle on todd rising to his knees, blinking stupidly, trying to focus as blood pours into his eyes from a gash in his forehead. todd's pov, a vague, unfocused image of sandra, snatching a bayonet from todd's gear on the floor and lunging courageously at caine 607. vaguely, todd sees caine 607 parry her thrust effortlessly and grab her. as she beats at caine 607 bravely with her fists, the big man slams her into a wall brutally. as she crumples, he hits her again. angle on todd struggling to his feet, staggering as he shakes his head to clear it. his eyes go to sandra, slumped against the wall, bloody. terrified children look up at caine 607 as he towers over them. suddenly... shtunk! a knife blade suddenly sticks in caine 607's neck. caine 607 only flinches... and, as he yanks the knife from his neck by the handle, he turns to see who threw the blade... wham! todd slams into him, tackling him, driving his big shoulder deep into the new soldier's waist, slamming the big man hard into a wall. air goes out of caine 607, the knife drops from his hand. but that's it for todd's victory. six five, two sixty, caine 607 is bigger and stronger than todd. his powerful arms rip todd off him like he's taking off a band aid. terrified, wide eyed children watch todd hurled back across the room. todd scrambles to his feet, shakes his head clear. here comes caine 607, dragging his bad leg. todd attacks! combining a martial arts feint and lunge with a vicious kick! but 607 counters expertly, brushing aside the attack! todd lunges again employing yet another skilled move. smack! caine 607 outmaneuvers todd again, punishing him brutally. whack! wham! smash! crunch! this time todd jolts the bigger man with a terrible combination of moves, smashing him in the adam's apple, kicking him in the knee, driving an elbow into the jaw. this time it's caine 607 who has to back away to recover. and now he seems to re consider todd, revealing for the first time a genuine respect. as their eyes meet, caine 607 seems to be saying "all right then, you're serious, let's do it, fella." todd lunges. smash! caine 607 creams him. todd twists, slams caine 607 back. bash! a fist to the face! ummmmmph! a knee in a groin! slam! a head against a wall!}
