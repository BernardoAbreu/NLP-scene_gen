<L>__{interior hospital room night}
<A>__{kirsty has opened more of the box. the tune is more complex now. somewhere a bell has started to ring. now, she works the final mechanism of the box. the bedside light flickers and goes out. the bell rings. light pours out of the box. she drops it, shocked. the bedside light comes on again. she looks up. in the wall opposite the end of her bed, a very narrow doorway has simply opened in the wall. leaving the box on the bed, she gets up and goes to the gap. as she approaches she hears the distant, rhythmical sob of a baby. she stands at the doorway.}
