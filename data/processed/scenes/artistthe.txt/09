<D>__{in the house, much of the audience is open mouthed, excited, immobile and often wide eyed. in the pit, a symphony orchestra plays to accompany the film.}

<D>__{sounding, the cast anxiously awaits the audience's verdict, which, after two or three seconds of silence, bursts into thunderous applause, to the great joy of the actor and the people around him, especially the actress and the producer, who kiss each other on the lips. two theater hands bring down the curtain.}

<D>__{and acknowledges the audience, they are cheering for him. he is so happy he dances a few tap steps to express his joy then he acknowledges the orchestra before finally motioning to someone in the wings to join him. jack the dog trots over in response. the crowd laughs and cheers, george waves to the dog, jack waves back then waves at the audience, the people are loving it! in the wings, constance is fuming with rage, but on stage, george is pretending with his fingers to pull at the dog, who fakes death. thunderous applause again. behind the actress, the producer can't hold back a smile, and this enrages the actress still more. suddenly, george, hamming it up, remembers something he'd forgotten, and asks someone from the other side of the wings to join him. it's constance. she comes over, smiling to the audience, and says something to george with a smile. title card: i will get you for that. she waves, but we can tell that her smile is set between her teeth. she isn't feeling comfortable. george motions firing a gun with his fingers, but she does not fall down, merely casts him a "very funny" glance. george looks at his fingers, not understanding why they don't work anymore then mimes throwing them away behind him, as though they've become useless. constance stalks back off into the wings in annoyance, but the audience is ecstatic. once in the wings, the actress sticks up her middle finger at george, and exaggeratedly mouths so he can read her lips: "put this up your ass." george, grinning broadly, responds by clapping his hands in applause, then leaves the stage, executing a few more dance steps as he does so. the audience is delighted. as he comes off stage, george gets soundly told off by constance, but, still grinning, he motions towards the audience who are still asking for more. the producer, although delighted by the successful reception, makes a weak attempt to calm the actress down. as for george, he returns to the stage, the audience roars. he pretends to want to leave the stage, and mimes bumping into an invisible wall just as he's leaving the stage. george holds his nose, the audience goes wild, constance gets even madder, and while george carries on clowning about, the producer too breaks into a beaming smile. he's probably realized that george has the audience on his side... constance, furious, storms off. she is followed by the producer who is trying to placate her, although it looks like he's got his work cut out for him.}
