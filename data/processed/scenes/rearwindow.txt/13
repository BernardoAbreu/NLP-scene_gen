<A>__{at this moment we hear the sounds of a piano playing. it is a simple, but broken, melody as if someone was just learning to play the piano, or carefully composing a song. it clashes abruptly with the music from the ballet dancer's apartment. it irritates jeff as he looks in the direction of the new music.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{it's worse than the chinese water torture.}
