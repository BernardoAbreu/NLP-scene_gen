<L>__{interior garage harmsway towers.}
<A>__{bond and sidney come out near a trolley stacked with newspapers. hearts pounding having left the pressroom's deafening noise they're ready for almost anything, except what they hear: the sound of one man applauding. a polite, almost bored clapping.}
<C>__{harmsway }
<D>__{vert, very, good mr. bond. outstanding performance.}
<A>__{harmsway is standing with ten guards, shoulder to shoulder, in a straight line, all holding weapons on sidney and bond.}
<C>__{harmsway }
<D>__{i'm the certain the british taxpayers would be impressed by your efforts. don't you agree?}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{i think they'd rather know who stole their gold.}
<A>__{harmsway can't help his ego:}
<C>__{harmsway}
<P>__{(chuckles)}
<D>__{why, i did, of course. it's on the sea dolphin ii, twenty miles outside of hong kong... not that it will do either of you any good to know.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now both of you: stand up. and toss the gun out, mr. bond.}
<A>__{bond slides the gun several feet in front of him... and throws a look to his car, noting the guards are lined up directly in its path. bond begins to scheme.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{uncle elliot: how could you do this to me?}
<A>__{bond sneaks his hand in his pocket.}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{oh, please, sidney. there's a hundred billion dollars at stake.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{besides, i never really liked your father that much. he cheated at cards.}
<A>__{bond has removed the car remote control. he palms it.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl?}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{my guards are from south africa, mr. bond. this is their chance to get even with the formerly 'great' britain.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now both of you. put your hands on your heads, and step forward.}
<A>__{holding the remote control, bond puts his hands on his head. he's manipulating the control into the right position to use it.}
<C>__{bond}
<P>__{(trying to buy time)}
<D>__{what did you do, harmsway? make some deal with the chinese government for the gold?.. was the radioactive uranium i found in venice part of it?}
<A>__{he finally has the remote control in the right position.}
<C>__{harmsway}
<D>__{questions, questions, mr. bond... which i'm afraid i've neither the time, nor the inclination to answer.}
<P>__{(to the guards)}
<D>__{take them out to the jungle and }
<A>__{suddenly, bond's car engine starts with a roar. the guards turn, in shock towards the car, as: bond retrieves the gun he slid out, and pulls sidney behind the newspaper trolley, while the car begins to move, sending the guards scrambling. bond takes his position with sidney.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{i forgot to mention: the job comes with a car.}
