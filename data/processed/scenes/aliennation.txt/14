<L>__{interior mini mart night}
<A>__{sykes moves through like a locomotive skidding on broken glass, bangs through the exit.}
<L>__{exterior alley night}
<A>__{sykes catches sight of the two aliens just as they round the corner at the far end of the alley. he takes off, quickly cranking up to full speed.}
<L>__{exterior back street night}
<A>__{sykes rounds the corner. doesn't see them anymore. he slows... moves along this street with some caution. lots of shadows, lots of hiding places. sykes hears a noise, looks up... just in time to see raincoat on a high, huge billboard. he cuts loose with the shotgun. sykes dives. huge chunks of the crate he dives behind fly off into the night. sykes, on his belly, scrambles deeper among the crates. raincoat's shotgun clicks empty now. he drops it, swings down off the fire escape, runs off. sykes is up again in a flash, pounding after him.}
