<A>__{lester starts unbuttoning angela's blouse. she seems disconnected from what's happening. lester pulls her blouse open, exposing her breasts. lester looks down at her, grinning, unable to believe he's actually about to do what he's dreamed of so many times, and then...}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{this is my first time.}
<A>__{lester laughs.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{you're kidding.}
<C>__{angela}
<P>__{(a whisper)}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{a beat. lester looks down at her, his grin fading. his pov: angela lies beneath us, embarrassed and vulnerable. this is not the mythically carnal creature of lester's fantasies; this is a nervous child.}
<C>__{angela }
<D>__{i still want to do it... i just thought i should tell you... in case you wondered why i wasn't... better.}

<D>__{you are so beautiful... and i would be a very lucky man...}
<A>__{he smiles and shakes his head. humiliated, angela starts to cry.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{i feel so stupid.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{don't.}
<A>__{he hugs her, letting her put her head on his shoulder, stroking her hair and rocking her gently.}

<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{lester takes her by the shoulders and looks at her, serious.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{you have nothing to be sorry about.}
<A>__{but she keeps crying. lester hugs her again. we hear a loud clap of thunder outside.}
