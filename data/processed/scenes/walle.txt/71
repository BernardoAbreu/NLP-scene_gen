<A>__{the passengers glide in by the thousands. form concentric circles over the closed up pools. fill the multi storied balconies on all sides.}
<B>__{on john and mary}
<A>__{they arrive together at the lido deck. mary notices a group of toddlers scared and crying. a nanny bot tries vainly to placate them.}
<D>__{nanny bot remain calm. remain calm.}
<B>__{close on bridge plaza}
<A>__{the bnl logo on the floor rotates. a large cylindrical device rises from the stage... ...the ship's holo detector. jumbotrons activate on the dome. show the bridge. everyone can see the captain wrestling auto. he tries to speak to them during the fight:}
<C>__{captain}
<P>__{(strained; in command)}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen! this is your captain speaking! we're having a slight malfunction with the autopilot! please remain calm!}
<A>__{the passengers get caught up in the conflict. treat it as if it were a televised fight.}
<B>__{on the rear of the deck}
<A>__{eve and wall e fly out of the transport tunnel. make a beeline for the holo detector. ready and waiting for the plant... ...almost there...}
<B>__{on bridge}

<D>__{enough.}
<A>__{auto furiously spins his wheel. throws the captain to the floor. the entire ship lists dangerously to one side.}
<B>__{on lido deck}
<A>__{eve and wall e slam into the holo detector's side. wall e drops the plant. it tumbles off the bridge plaza. eve is forced to set wall e down. he clings to the holo detector. she flies off to retrieve the plant. the hover chairs stay locked on their lines. passengers all slip off their chairs. their uniform color defaults back to red. slowly slide across the deck. and for the first time... ...all of humanity reaches out to one another. close ups of hands holding hands. everyone piles up on the listing side. the plant is buried underneath the mass of humanity. eve searches desperately amongst them. on john & mary they hang together off their chairs. crying toddlers just above them. the kiddies slip out of their hover rings. mary gasps in horror. yells to john:}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{john, get ready to have some kids!}
<A>__{they purposefully let go of their chairs. grab hands, forming a human chain. catch the toddlers. all slide together down the lido deck. the toddlers giggle the whole way down. they land at the bottom, next to eve. an empty monorail car tips off the upper deck... ...lands on the pool level. it begins sliding down the lido deck. smashes vacant hover chairs in its wake.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(gasp)}
<D>__{look out!}
<A>__{eve looks up. sees the monorail sliding towards them. she stops the car before it hits. struggles to hold it up. can't let it crush the passengers below her.}

<B>__{on lido deck}
<A>__{the holo detector begins to lower back into the floor... wall e is still hanging onto it. barely functioning. he uses all his strength... ...and wedges himself under the upper lip of the detector. stops it from disappearing into the floor. the pressure squeezes wall e into a box.}
<B>__{on bridge}
<A>__{the holo detector button buzzes and flashes. something's wrong. auto calls up a lido deck security camera view. discovers wall e wedged in the device.}
<C>__{auto}
<D>__{no.}

<C>__{captain}
<D>__{no!!}
<A>__{back on wall e the holo detector reverses full force. crushes wall e. we can't tell if he survived the crush. eve calls out for him. trapped, holding up the monorail car above the passengers.}

<A>__{the captain watches wall e being crushed. that's it. he braces his arms against the floor... ...and rises up on his own two feet...}

<C>__{captain }
<D>__{auto!}
<A>__{auto whips around. shocked to see the captain standing (albeit wobbly). finds himself face to face with him. auto flips out his taser. rushes at him. the captain grabs it. they wrestle. the taser arcs in the captain's face. he flinches. looks up. sees a control panel high up on auto's column... ...and smirks. the captain looks auto in the eye. raises a finger up to the control panel... ...to the "autopilot" button... ...and flicks the switch to "manual".}

<D>__{noo }
<A>__{auto is instantly turned off. the captain smiles triumphantly. grabs the wheel with both hands. makes the ship level again.}
<B>__{on lido deck}
<A>__{the passengers all spill across the deck. shaken but ok. eve sets the monorail down. rockets over to the holo detector. wall e is pinned under the lip of the holo detector. eve tries to lift it up. it won't budge. she looks back to the crowd.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{plant! plant!}
<A>__{on m o he searches the crowd for the plant. humans begin to stand for the first time all around him. through his pov he spots the plant mixed in among them. "foreign contaminant" flashes on his display screen.}

<A>__{she fights to keep the machine from crushing wall e further.}
<P>__{m o (o.s.)}
<D>__{ee vah!}
<A>__{m o holds the plant up from across the lido deck. the vacu bot shoots it into the hands of a passenger. humans and robots form an impromptu fire line. toss it up to eve on stage. she shoves the plant into the device. the detector instantly scans the plant.}

<D>__{plant origin verified. course set for earth.}
<A>__{slowly, the holo detector rises... wall e topples out from underneath. badly crushed and leaking oil. eve gasps in horror. m o and the rejects avert their eyes. passengers recoil as well.}
