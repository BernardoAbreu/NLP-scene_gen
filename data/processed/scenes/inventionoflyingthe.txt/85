<L>__{interior mark's car day}
<A>__{mark drives while we take in a bit of his world, highlighting the various changes he's wrought. a homeless man stands on the street corner with a sign that now reads, "screw it. i will be in my mansion soon." he has a big smile on his face. the same business man pulls up beside mark's car, this time eating a giant donut and talking loudly into his cell phone.}
<C>__{business man}
<D>__{i'm not talking to anyone on my cell phone. but from a distance i look very important and busy.}
<A>__{at a red light mark eavesdrops on the same arguing couple.}
<C>__{girlfriend}
<D>__{no, i won't move into your mansion with you when we die. you're really smothering me.}
<C>__{boyfriend}
<D>__{the more you push me away, the more attracted i am to you.}
<A>__{a bus passes in front of mark's car. the ad now reads, "pepsi. just as good as coke." a car honks behind mark. the man leans out of his car and yells at mark.}
<C>__{honking man}
<D>__{move it, fatty!}
<A>__{as the man passes him, he looks at mark and pulls up beside him.}
<C>__{honking man}
<D>__{hey you're mark bellison!}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yeah. so are you going to apologize?}
<C>__{honking man}
<D>__{for what?}
<A>__{the honking man speeds away.}
