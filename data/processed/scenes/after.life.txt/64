<L>__{interior funeral home. eliot's office day}
<A>__{eliot's by his desk. checking his appointment book. whistling softly to himself. we can't hear anna's cries. he pours a cup of tea. adds a drop of milk. as he stirs his tea, he hears the sound of feet crunching on the gravel outside. he glances out the window. eliot's pov paul stands in the middle of the driveway staring blankly at the funeral home.}
