<D>__{remember this thing about dusty being a bull horner, going to far?}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{why he was fired from deathwatch, and the a.c.l.u.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{right. maybe the plan was for dusty to release the tape after gale's conviction, after a year or so. you know, force him to dry out, let him play the heroic victim, give him back his dignity. so, dusty wright's sitting on this tape, waiting, the only one who knows about it. and maybe good ole dusty starts to think that an erroneous execution is a hell of a lot more politically useful than a last minute save.}

<D>__{which would only prove the system works.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{yeah. almost martyrs don't count. what's one murder to stop thousands?}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{so he'll wait, release the whole tape after the execution.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{right. somewhere he must have the original. what time is it?}
