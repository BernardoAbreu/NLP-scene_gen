<L>__{interior the china room night}
<A>__{named for its beautiful glass display cases featuring full place settings of the official white house china and silverware from every administration since jackson.}
<T>__{shepherd:}
<P>__{(remembering)}
<D>__{i think this is the dish room.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{it's not the dish }
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{yeah, it is. it's the room with all the dishes.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{it's the china room.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{i'm more of a west wing president. if you're curious about the mansion, there's probably a book you can get }
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{there're about seven thousand books. i will get one for you.}
<A>__{sydney's been walking slowly around the room, looking at the display cases, and as she gets near one of the large windows, she takes another step which drapes her in a shaft of incredibly flattering moonlight. the vision isn't lost on shepherd. they stare at each other for a moment.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{sydney.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{mr. president have you ever noticed how similar the van buren flatware is to the buchanan flatware?}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{do you think there will ever come a time when you can stand in a room with me and not think of me as the president?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{this isn't a state of mind. you are the president. and when i'm in a room with you, oval or any other shape, i'm always gonna be a lobbyist, and you'll always be the president.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{i got news for you, sydney. as a lobbyist, you would never be alone in a room with the president.}
<A>__{this last statement is not lost on sydney. he moves toward her until they are both bathed in the moonlight. he puts his arms around her.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{you think this is a good idea?}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{probably not.}
<A>__{they lean in to kiss each other. they barely make contact when...}
<P>__{agent #3 (o.s.)}
<D>__{mr. president...}
<A>__{an agent is standing in the doorway shepherd and sydney break apart.}
<D>__{agent #3 we have a secure call from the sit room.}
<A>__{shepherd knows what that means.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{he moves out the door and into the corridor. sydney, knowing something's wrong, instinctively moves to follow him and be with him, but the agent hasn't moved from the doorway, so }
<D>__{agent #3 sorry, ma'am.}
<C>__{sydney}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{no...of course.}
<A>__{shepherd comes back in.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{listen }
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{is anything wrong?}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{i'm sorry, we're going to have to cut our evening short. the libyans have just bombed c stad. i will try to call you tomorrow.}
<P>__{(to the agent)}
<D>__{can you show ms. wade out.}
<A>__{shepherd exits. sydney, alone for a second in the dish room, is finally approached by a secret service agent, who starts to escort her out.}
<C>__{chairman }
<D>__{the response scenario's in place...}
