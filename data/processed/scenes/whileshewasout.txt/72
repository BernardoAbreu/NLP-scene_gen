<L>__{interior ford explorer evening}
<A>__{the car stalls out. silence. a prolonged moment. then della crawls out from under the dashboard, sweeping pine needles and glass from her hair. she reaches up and hits the light switch. pine branches protrude through the broken windshield. using the sleeve of her coat she sweeps broken glass from the driver's seat and sits down. she slides the gear into park, turns the key. the engine groans like a dying animal, then gives up. she takes a deep breath. she tries again. the engine groans again, another death rattle. it just won't catch. she switches off the interior light and pushes the driver door open. she steps out of the car.}
