<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior avenue des champs elysees later that night}
<A>__{a taxi cab filled with bill, francis, shep, nikki and frink pulls up to a restaurant. as it stops, bill rises and points to someone at a sidewalk table.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{hey! there he is!}
<A>__{the others look.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{come on!}
<A>__{the group cheers, spills out of the taxi and heads for:}
<B>__{the sidewalk table}
<A>__{where cary sits reading a newspaper.}
<C>__{shep }
<D>__{cary!}
<A>__{cary looks up. he rises, a little startled, and politely removes his hat. the others crowd around him.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{say, what are you tryin' to do, disown us?}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(genuinely polite)}
<D>__{hello. won't you sit down?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{sure we'll sit down. what'd ya think we'd do? stand around?}
<A>__{they all take seats around the little table. during this, frink brings a chair for nikki who grabs a seat of her own. when he tries to use it to sit next to her, bill commandeers it for himself.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(with a wave, to frink)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{a waiter joins them as they settle in.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{hello, cary.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{hello, shep. hello, nikki. what will you have to drink?}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{martini!}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{martini!}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{martini!}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{martini!}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{quatre martinis?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{uh, could i have champagne, please?}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{champagne? oui.}
<A>__{the waiter departs. off her order, bill gives nikki a look.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{boys, she's goin' to be a problem.}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(explains, to bill)}
<D>__{that's what i started on.}
<P>__{(to cary)}
<D>__{it upsets me if i change over to anything else.}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(to bill)}
<D>__{there's a lot of things wrong with this one.}
<P>__{(to nikki)}
<D>__{what were you doing at the bar at claridge's anyway?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{yes. don't you know you're not supposed to be there?}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{there's a sign on the wall says ladies must sit at the back.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{can't read signs.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{well, we'll just have to take care of her, that's all.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{do you think she's good lookin' enough?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{oh, i know i'm not very good looking but }
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{but what?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{but when i was a little girl, my mother always said i had the nicest hair ribbon.}
<A>__{shep laughs derisively. the others give him a look and he shuts up. the drinks arrive. all the men, save cary, snatch up their glasses. bill removes the toothpicked olive and swallows his martini whole. he watches nikki rubbing her champagne's drinking straw between her hands as if she were a boy scout trying to start a fire.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{then there's her drinking.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{what's the matter with my drinking?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you're a sissy drinker.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{well, maybe i can improve.}
<A>__{meanwhile, cary attempts with some success to drink his martini with one unsteady hand. bill inspects nikki's mouth.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{then there's her teeth. why, one of 'em is turned sideways.}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(points)}
<D>__{you mean this one?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{that's it.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{why don't you have it turned around?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{i don't have it turned around on account of it's a kind of help.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{well, in what respect does it kind of help?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{well, you see, when anyone kisses me too hard, it splits my lip. and you could tell when anyone kissed me too hard on account of my lip would bleed. so now i don't let anyone kiss me hard.}
<A>__{the men are amused. nikki sips her champagne.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{well, we'll let that pass.}
<A>__{bill chuckles. shep abruptly rises and walks off, presumably to the rest room.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{where's he gone?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{shep went off to sharpen his skates.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{now, about your nose.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{what about my nose?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{it isn't straight. it kind of turns up at the end.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{well, when i was a little girl, i got bumped by a swing.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{how'd you happen to get bumped?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{i just walked through the gate. i was only seven.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{oh, poor dear. didn't you see it?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{i can't see very far.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{did it hurt?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{it made me dizzy all day.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{well, i guess we can't hold that against her.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{we all make mistakes.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{that's right. michelangelo painted adam with a navel.}
<A>__{bill and nikki laugh at this. suddenly, nikki grows thoughtful.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{all the same, he'd look funny the other way even in a painting.}
<A>__{they all consider this for a moment as a fresh round of drinks arrives. frink abruptly rises and walks off, presumably to the rest room.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{where's he gone?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{he went off to shave a horse.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{have you got a husband or anything?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{no husband.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{a mother?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{mother, yes. but we haven't met in quite a long time.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{why not in a long time?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{well, on account of my mother's name was beulah. now, you can't have a mother named beulah. so i changed it to jane. and that's how it all began.}
<A>__{an odd chiming sound distracts them. they look off to see:}
<B>__{francis}
<A>__{the narcoleptic, arms folded, asleep in his chair. he awakes with a frown, pulls a pocket watch from inside his jacket, opens it, and looks at it. the chiming ends and he rises without a word and exits.}
<B>__{at the table}
<A>__{nikki watches francis' exit curiously. bill waves her off before she can ask:}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{he's goin' off to tame an alligator.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{who is he, anyway?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{francis used to fly with us in the 94th. the best shot in the squadron. brought down twelve planes. used to call him "sudden death." he lost interest after his teammate got killed. he's lonesome is all.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{i like him.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{he carries a chiming watch on account of he's always falling asleep in the daytime.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{what kind of chimes?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{oh, westminster, canterbury, and whittington.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{i will take vanilla.}
<A>__{cary puts a fist on his hip and gives nikki an exasperated look. taxi horns squeak. francis, shep and frink return from their various adventures and sit down as bill gives nikki his opinion of francis.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i think he's a washout.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{well, just because you're a big bombardier and an all american }
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(interrupts)}
<D>__{all american what?}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{halfback.}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{oh, montana state or somewhere. idaho or nebraska or the carlisle indians or something. didn't you never read about bill? bronko bill the alabama flash?}
<A>__{bill grins as nikki inspects him closely through her lorgnette.}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(skeptical)}
<D>__{i think it's a forgery.}
<A>__{bill's face falls. he looks at nikki.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{say! what do you want me to do? tackle a horse?}
<A>__{she nods. shep is amused.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{sure. go ahead. tackle a horse.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(with a dismissive wave)}
<D>__{all right, all right, i will tackle a horse.}
<A>__{shep looks down the street.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{here comes one now.}
<A>__{they all look to see: a horse drawn cab rolling down the street in their direction.}
<B>__{at the table}
<A>__{everyone watches as bill rises and suddenly bolts in the direction of the cab.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{look out, horse!}
<A>__{the horse drawn cab rolling along as bill runs in and tackles the horse, locking his big arms around the animal's front legs to trip up the poor creature.}
<B>__{on the sidewalk}
<A>__{cary, horrified, stands and yells:}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{hey, bill! bill! come back here!}
<A>__{cary runs off, toward bill, leaving a thrilled shep and a worried francis with a distressed nikki. they all stare in concerned amazement as a crowd of pedestrians stops to watch the excitement.}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(distraught)}
<D>__{oh, bill!}
<A>__{at the horse drawn cab cary rushes up to the startled cab driver who is pulling hard on the reins.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{hey! what's the idea runnin' down my friend like that? here!}
<A>__{cary forces a wad of francs into the driver's hand. the cabman protests in french but takes the cash.}
<B>__{wider view}
<A>__{of the fallen horse as the driver descends from the cab. standing up now, bill tries to haul the horse to its feet while cary tries to placate the driver.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{never mind. look where you're going in the future now. you just watch out where you're going!}
<B>__{another view}
<A>__{bill grabs the horse by its bridle and tries to pull it up. the horse, sorely annoyed, gets up on its own and shakes its head violently to drive bill away. bill hangs on and tries to calm the horse. cary tries to pull bill away as frink, francis and the driver gather around. bill is more interested in petting the horse which understandably shies away from him.}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(admonishes bill)}
<D>__{now listen, come on out here, you old fool.}
<P>__{(to the shying horse)}
<D>__{whoa, whoa.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{nice horsie.}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(to bill)}
<D>__{now, listen, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. you old fool! you know what you'll do? you'll kill yourself one of these days. now, come on, get out of here. now, listen }
<A>__{satisfied with the outcome of all this, bill heads back for the sidewalk.}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(to the driver)}
<D>__{you all right now, brother?}
<A>__{the driver nods but is more concerned with reining in his skittish horse.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{all right. now, you just keep your horse, see? you got your money.}
<A>__{the cabbie salutes cary but pays more attention to his horse.}
<B>__{back at the sidewalk table}
<A>__{the waiter sets out a fresh round of drinks as the group returns. bill happily dusts off the sleeve of his dinner jacket. cary, beside him, leads him to his seat. they all sit down under the following:}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{hey, listen, bill, you're all american, see? you're two all americans! the lady's convinced you're the whole team. you don't have to tackle any more horses. how 'bout that? drink your drink.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(pleased with himself)}
<D>__{ahhh. wasn't that a great spill?}
<A>__{nikki abruptly rises.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{hey! where are you going?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{would you all excuse me for a moment?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{well, where are you going?}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(a grave announcement)}
<D>__{to take a chinese singing lesson.}
<A>__{francis immediately understands that she's become one of them. he raises an olive in the air and cheers:}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{hooray!}
<A>__{the men rise and all but frink cheer her lustily as she departs:}
<C>__{men}
<D>__{hooray! hooray! hooray! hooray!}
<B>__{nikki}
<A>__{walks proudly into the restaurant as the men cheer. a smiling maitre d' directs her to the ladies' room.}
<B>__{back at the table}
<A>__{frink watches nikki disappear from view and, after a glance at the others, rises and follows her. shep, bill and cary remain at the table, laughing and drinking. bill turns to cary with a smile.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{hey. what kind of a girl do you think nikki is?}
<A>__{cary glances in nikki's direction and tells bill confidentially:}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{i think she's the kind that sits down on phonograph records.}
<A>__{bill thinks about this and nods.}
<B>__{inside the restaurant}
<A>__{as nikki returns from her chinese singing lesson, frink puts his arm against a wall, blocking her way.}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{say, nikki, let's ditch these drunks and go off somewhere by ourselves. these crazy fools are liable to do anything.}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(hopeful)}
<D>__{do you think so?}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{since the war, they don't care what happens.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{and do you?}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{i will say so. i've got more important things to think of.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{what more important things?}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{well, my work.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{what kind of work?}
<C>__{frink}
<D>__{i'm the foreign correspondent for a new york newspaper syndicate.}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(genuinely)}
<D>__{how nice for you!}
<A>__{nikki pushes his arm away and heads for the table. frink watches her go, a dark look on his face.}
<B>__{back at the sidewalk table}
<A>__{the men rise briefly as nikki rejoins them and sits.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{nikki? are you the kind of girl that sits down on phonograph records?}
<A>__{nikki lowers her eyes.}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(a bit defensively)}
<D>__{people shouldn't leave their records lying about.}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(to francis)}
<D>__{what did i tell you?}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(abruptly brightens)}
<D>__{take me dancing?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{what place you wanna go?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{what places you got?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{well, we got maxim's, only it's too early. we've got florida, perroquet, pigalle, le rat mort, moulin rouge, bal tabarin.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{i will take vanilla.}
<A>__{cary gives her a look. bill clears his throat.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{somebody pay for the drinks!}
<A>__{bill rises and claps his hands with enthusiasm.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{we're off in a "billizzard" of horse radish!}
<A>__{whatever that means. the men rise and retrieve their hats.}
