<L>__{interior kettle restaurant night}
<A>__{bitsey and zack sit at a booth having coffee. zack smokes. the vhs cassette is also between them, as is a small stack of crumpled tissues. the thunderstorm can be heard in the distance. the waitress is refilling their cups, and they wait until she leaves. hushed tones.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{let's say gale's right. some sick fuck agatha christie wannabe set him up, arranged like the perfect murder. why send a magazine journalist proof a few hours before he's won? doesn't make sense.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{no, it's perfect. he knows news magazine won't give the scoop to the dailies or nightly news, not after having paid for it. probably guessed we wouldn't call the cops. and, most importantly, knows i will tell gale tomorrow.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{why does he give a shit?}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{zack, what if harraway's murder was just a means to getting gale. i mean sending him through hell, a sick cat and mouse game. you kill the one person he has left. make sure he sits six years on death row for the murder a place he's made a public career of loathing. and then just let him die, die knowing everyone will remember him with disgust. you destroy his loved ones, his life's work, his memory and you make him watch.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{that's a lot of hate. you're talking beyond sadism.}
<A>__{bitsey gestures to the tape, makes a need i say more face.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{then why release it?}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{if the mouse dies the game's over. maybe the cat's enjoying himself. or...}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{or?}
<C>__{bitsey}
<P>__{(picks up the tape)}
<D>__{imagine walking to the chamber knowing this exists.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{the 'cat' is a fucking psychopath.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{yeah, but smart.}
