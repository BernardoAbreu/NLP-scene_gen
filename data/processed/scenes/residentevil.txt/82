<C>__{ada}
<P>__{(to wesker) is it true? are you}
<D>__{here to... rescue? or destroy?}
<C>__{wesker}
<P>__{both. (with that odd smile of his)}
<D>__{if i have to pick only one... i will pick destroy.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{you're not s.t.a.r.s. you're umbrella.}
<C>__{wesker}
<P>__{once again. both. (still smiling)}
<D>__{two salaries. three if you count combat pay.}
<A>__{ada looks at him with disgust.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{the man i loved, john marcus... developed the organism that caused all this. he... he did it for humanitarian purposes. it was taken away from him...for in human purposes...by men like you!}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{no, ma'am. men like me... are just errand boys. sent in to do the wet work. all of the glory. none of the benefits.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{after what you've seen down here, do you think any of it could be turned into... benefit?}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{yes. i think it could be turned into five or ten million dollars. how do we get into "d" lab?}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{death lab. (she slumps) john was killed...never even knowing it existed. they kept him... isolated, upstairs, while a separate team was down here...corrupting his research. using it to build b.o.w.s.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{b.o.w.s?}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{bio organic weapons.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{the sharks. the plant.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{early experiments.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{the snake.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{a failure. its behavior remained reptilian. all they could ever get it to do was... grow in size.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{those dogs. they were weapons.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{no. they... simply became infected. as did... everyone else. janitors. the cook. electricians. guards. people who believed they were serving their flag. scientists. great minds... turned into mindless.. .ghouls!}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{before the outbreak, the experiments went further, didn't they? those... ceiling crawlers out there.. .}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{the product of human dna spliced with the dna of vicious carnivores... animals, even insects. plated with armor, beneath newly cultivated skin. then... injected with poison, so their biological components would die.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{die.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{the "t" virus reactivates them in a matter of minutes, but... in battle, lost minutes are... inconvenient. so, the b.o.w.s had to die... and be allowed to revive before they could be used to... full advantage. they were murdered... by their own people... so they could never be murdered again... by the enemy.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{were any more of these...weapons... developed?}
<A>__{ada is about to answer, but wesker interrupts.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{how do we get into "d" lab?}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{you don't.}
<A>__{ada glances at an innocuous wall panel. wesker notices a key slot. green.}
<C>__{ada }
<D>__{it can't be opened. thank god. none of us is cleared for that level of security.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{how fortunate... that i am.}
<A>__{wesker steps over to the wall and inserts his green card into the slot. the panel slides open. beyond it is a steel door with another green slot. wesker uses his card again. a lock clicks. wesker pushes the door open.}
<C>__{wesker }
<D>__{barry. come with me. the rest of you.. .make sure this door doesn't close. remember...}
<A>__{wesker taps his ear piece. everyone gets his meaning. he and barry disappear through the opening. the steel door begins to close. rodriguez lunges, and catches it.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{have...you been leaving doors open?}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{this place is going to be overrun by...}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{brad's in really bad shape.}
<A>__{brad is leaning against a wall, sweating, shivering. rebecca looks at his wounded leg.}
<C>__{rebecca }
<D>__{that's not just a scrape. you were bitten, weren't you?}
<C>__{vickers}
<D>__{one...of the sharks. its teeth. i just...brushed up against its teeth...after it was dead.}
<C>__{ada}
<P>__{(alert) shoot him. somebody,}
<D>__{shoot him!}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{no! we're so close. the antidote.}
