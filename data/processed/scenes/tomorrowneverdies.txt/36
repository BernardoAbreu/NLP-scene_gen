<A>__{on the tiles, he slides down, rolling to the edge. he looks down: the adjoining building is one story lower, with a skylight roof. as bond struggles to climb back to the peak of the second roof return on the balcony thug #1 holsters his gun, and climbs on the banister. he's too heavy to climb onto the roof by himself so thug #2 shoves him from below. first rooftop thug #1 searches for bond. he hears bond moving, below him, on the next building. he makes a running leap. second (lower) rooftop bond has hauled himself up to a crouch as thug #1 lands. they grapple. the thug sends bond sliding down toward the edge of the roof, then loses his balance, and slides down after bond. at the edge of the roof, bond is about to slide off, onto the skylight below, but grabs the copper gutter at the last moment.}
