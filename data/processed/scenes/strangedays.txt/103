<L>__{interior elevator tran's loft}
<A>__{the huge elevator, with lenny its sole occupant, descends through the shadows toward the first floor. lenny watches the shadow patterns on the wall through the iron grillwork door. he's still thinking about faith... ... even when the elevator reaches the first floor and mace comes into view. she's waiting for him. he steps forward. but he can't open the grillwork door. and the elevator doesn't stop. it keeps going down. lenny, spooked, works the door hard... as mace disappears from view above him... ... and the elevator bumps to a stop in the basement. with vita and the beef squad waiting for lenny, stoney faced. last stop. all out. lenny tries to keep the door shut, but duncan wrenches it open. vita grabs lenny and twists his arm painfully behind him in one fluid move. they hustle him toward a dank basement room near the elevator.}

<D>__{listen, can we be smart here? i could make it really worth your while... i could cut you a check for 500 each... hell, make it an even grand... i'm not saying you don't land a couple shots, just go light is all i'm saying... here, take my rolex.}
<C>__{corto}
<D>__{lemme see.}
<A>__{a glimmer of hope in lenny's eye as he whips it off his wrist. corto doesn't even look at it. gets it over his hand about mid way, then using the watch like a pair of brass knuckles clobbers lenny in the face. watch parts go flying as corto steps away and duncan slams lenny up against a column. vita weighs in... gut punching lenny savagely. she works him expertly, with a series of painful jabs. he sags to his knees. not only is this painful. it's goddamn humiliating. and duncan and corto enjoy every second of it.}
<C>__{corto}
<D>__{we tried to find a smaller girl, to beat the shit out of you, lenny... but it was short notice.}
<A>__{vita grabs lenny by his hair and pulls him up with one rock hard arm. she is cocking back the other arm for a pile driver punch when... suddenly a dark shape materializes behind her. mace drives vita head first into the steel column. duncan lunges in and grabs for mace. this is a mistake. mace doesn't fight fancy. and she doesn't fight fair. she fights to win. and she is awesomely fast. her moves are street moves, coupled with arm locks and come alongs she has been trained to use as a security driver. lenny recovers enough to size up vita, who is still a little stunned. she has blood dripping in her eyes and can't see too well. but she charges him. and being the gent that he is he busts her over the head with a dusty old folding chair. mace drops duncan about the time vita is hitting the ground, leaving... corto, who fumbles out a beretta 9mm and sticks it in mace's face. he sniggers, loving the upper hand.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{safety's on.}
<A>__{and like a jerk, he looks. she snaps sideways in a headfake and closes blindingly fast, twisting the gun out of his hand. she continues to twist his wrist brutally and corto goes down to one knee, groaning. she takes his beretta and backhands the barrel hard across his face. mace releases his wrist and he crumples in a heap. she and lenny back out the door. then lenny runs back in and kicks corto in the ribs.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{lenny!}
<A>__{mace grabs him and pulls him out of the room, then slams the metal firedoor behind them, locking it with a piece of junk wedged behind the release bar.}
