<A>__{nicky looks up to see adrian flying down towards him. nicky rolls away at the last second. adrian hits the bed hard and bounces up. nicky grabs him mid bounce and slams him back down into the golden brass headboard of the bed. nicky holds out the flask.}
<C>__{nicky}

<A>__{adrian grabs a pillow and hits nicky hard in the face, sending him flying off the bed.}
<C>__{nicky }
<D>__{oh, you wanna a pillow fight, do you?!}
<A>__{nicky is an expert pillow fighter. he lands a series of awesome, almost matrix like pillow moves. adrian is dazed. nicky finishes him off by tossing the pillow high in the air to him. adrian looks up to catch it and just before it lands, nicky steps up and pops him in the face. adrian goes down hard. nicky towers over him.}
<C>__{nicky }
<D>__{now will you get in the flask?}

<A>__{he is covered in bees again.}
<B>__{back on adrian}
<A>__{he turns his attention back to nicky who is grabbed by demons. adrian brings the flask to his lips, but he won't open his mouth. adrian pinches nicky's nose closed so he has to open his mouth.}

<D>__{goodbye, nicky.}
<A>__{we hear cassius banging against the walls.}
<C>__{cassius }
<D>__{come on in, bro.}
<A>__{nicky can't hold his breath and opens his mouth. adrian jams the flask in his mouth and nicky starts to get sucked in. adrian smiles. but just before nicky is gone, he manages to grab adrian's coat tail and yank him into the flask with him. as the flask hits the ground, we hear:}
<D>__{cassius (o.s.) (cont'd) thank you, nicky. cause now i'm gonna bust adrian's head wide open.}
<C>__{adrian }
<D>__{i was going to let you out, eventually, cassius. i swear.}
<C>__{nicky }
<D>__{sole ruler of hell and earth is what i heard him keep saying.}
<A>__{we hear the sounds of a struggle. all the demons and all the people of new york form a large circle around the flask. valerie and the gang make it down off the stage. we hear crazy sounds as the flask starts to jump. the crowd reacts. a big dent pops out from the inside, followed by a horrible thud.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{nicky!}
<C>__{nicky }
