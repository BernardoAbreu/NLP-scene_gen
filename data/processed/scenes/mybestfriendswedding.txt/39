<D>__{boo!!!}
<A>__{she jumps a foot, both hands flying up, left one awkwardly slamming back into its pocket. the girls have snuck up behind her. they have changed into hot gowns that are really only wide ribbons wrapped around their bodies.}

<D>__{i know why you're scared of our party. it's too hip.}

<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{and yet here you are. all celibate and reclusive.}
<C>__{mandy}
<D>__{with those big, dark, haunted eyes. as if you were harborin' some... unspeakably... guilty... secret.}
<A>__{oh.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{well, i'm worried about something.}
<A>__{something. their expressions are deliciously, identically expectant.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{oh. i left this really important file in walter's office. i have to send my editor some...}
<A>__{some...}
<C>__{julianne}

<D>__{right. and then it didn't want to come off. exactly.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{maybe it's happy there.}
<C>__{mandy}
<D>__{oh the way out of the crab house? we asked michael if we could see the ring?}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{he said you told him. it'd be safer with you.}
<C>__{mandy}
