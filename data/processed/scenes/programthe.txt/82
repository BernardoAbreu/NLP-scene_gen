<L>__{interior weight room late night}
<A>__{camille, unable to sleep, enters in her workout clothes. languid, melancholy, she goes to the treadmill, as joe comes out of the steam room with nothing but a towel around his waist. both are surprised to see the other.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what are you doin' here?}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{couldn't sleep.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i was just sweatin' out some of the beer.}
<A>__{camille just nods. long, silent pause.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i didn't go home with her. i thought about it... but i didn't.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{you drink too much.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yeh.}
<A>__{he turns, starts toward the door.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{why didn't you?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{why didn't i what?}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{go home with her?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i don't know... i guess i figured maybe there was somethin' goin' on between you and me.}
<A>__{camille hesitates, not sure whether to believe him, then gets off the bike and walks toward him.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{then why'd you pick her up in the first place?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i was drunk... i needed some company.}
<C>__{camille}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{company? yeh, i can see you havin' a real far ranging discussion with sheri.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i mean, ya know, physical company... i was... i just needed to pounce on somebody i guess.}
<A>__{camille, really steamed now, snatches the towel from around joe's waist, leaving him naked.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{why can't you pounce on me? aren't i good enough to pounce on?}
<A>__{camille snaps the towel at him, driving him back. joe's totally thrown by this reaction in her.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{well, you're more conservative... classier... you're not that kinda girl...}
<A>__{she snaps the towel again, backing him against the training table.}
<C>__{camille}
<P>__{(insulted)}
<D>__{how do you know? you've never slept with me.}
<A>__{she pounds on his chest, pushing him back on the table.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{what makes you think she's such a great ride?}
<P>__{(climbing up on top of him)}
<D>__{i'm prettier, my legs are longer...}
<P>__{(pulling down her leotard)}
<D>__{i've got better tits.}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{why would you go to her, when you have me?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i didn't know i had you.}
<C>__{camille}
<P>__{(softer, leaning close)}
<D>__{well you do.}
<A>__{he looks at her a beat, then pulls her mouth down to his. they fall into a long, white hot kiss.}
