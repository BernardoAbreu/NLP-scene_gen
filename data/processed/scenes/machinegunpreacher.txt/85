<A>__{quiet. just sam on this porch all alone, been here for some time, eyes far off, images in his mind he can't seem to shake. and he steps into the yard... walking along the side of the house... just moving... trying to shed this feeling like snakeskin... ... and he comes to something on the ground which stops him dead in his tracks... something we don't see yet... and slowly he reaches down and picks up... a little doll. one of paige's toys. soiled and faded and left in the dirt. and we watch him holding this forgotten doll... and what we see on his face ain't pretty... his world collapsing out from under him... trying to keep rein on his emotions... a battle he's losing.}
