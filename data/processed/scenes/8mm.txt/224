<A>__{welles enters the filthy kitchen, carrying eddie's gun. at the sink, welles pops the gun's clip. he pushes the bullets out into his palm, one by one. he dumps the bullets into the garbage disposal, drops the clip in, turns it on. the disposal makes a terrible grinding noise, straining, till it finally goes dead.}
<L>__{interior eddie's living room day}
<A>__{welles goes to the picture window and closes the curtains. he turns on a lamp, goes back towards the bedroom. after a moment, he returns, dragging eddie on the floor... eddie's bleeding out his nose, hands duct taped together behind his back, legs bound at the ankle, dragged by a belt around his neck, choking... welles drops the belt, undoes it from eddie's neck. eddie gasps for air. welles pulls him up, puts him on the couch.}
