<L>__{interior high school day}
<A>__{close on graffiti written across lockers freddy lives! we move from this to a small classroom window. through it we see meagan sitting in economics class. the instructor miss krepps is lecturing.}
<C>__{miss krepps}
<P>__{(blah blah. blah blah blah.)}
<A>__{it's hot. several of the kids fan themselves, struggling to stay awake while others have already passed out on their desks. meagan's eyes are heavy. she looks over at jesse, pretending to follow along in his book, fast asleep. the antique oscillating fan on miss krepps' desk clicks loudly as she drones on:}
<C>__{miss krepps}
<P>__{(continuing) (blah blah blah. blah blah.)}
<A>__{meagan starts to drift off, when...}
<C>__{miss krepps}
<P>__{(continuing; loud)}
<D>__{meagan!?}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{yes, ma'am?}
<C>__{miss krepps}
<D>__{i asked if you were ready to give your oral report?}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{yes... i'm ready.}
<C>__{miss krepps}
<D>__{please come up here to the podium.}
<A>__{meagan gets up and goes to the podium amidst the snickers of some of her classmates. miss krepps snaps her fingers for quiet.}
<C>__{miss krepps}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you won't think it's funny when you haven't learned the fundamentals of a free market economy... oh, why do i waste my breath? you're all going to grow up to be gas station attendants and waitresses anyway. go ahead, meagan.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{my report is on global economic trends.}
<P>__{(clears throat; begins reading)}
<D>__{try and think of a world where there is no poverty... no sickness... no crime. a world where everyone is happy to be alive and everyone lives together in peace. this is my dream.}
<A>__{the fan on miss krepps' desk starts to click louder, blowing harder. meagan raises an eyebrow but continues with her report.}
<C>__{meagan}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{this dream is becoming a reality with ever growing international business...}
<A>__{close on the fan as it changes... getting creepier... turning into a freddy fan. blowing harder... clicking louder.}
<C>__{miss krepps}
<D>__{louder, meagan. we can't hear you.}
<A>__{meagan repeats the last few sentences, raising her voice to be heard over the fan. then pages of her report start to blow away. she grabs at them as the wind increases. a bottle of glue stowed in the podium overturns and spills to the floor at meagan's feet. she bends over to pick it up, when her skirt blows up. she presses it down but the wind is too great and the skirt billows up, revealing her underwear. the class roars with laughter.}
<C>__{miss krepps}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{louder, meagan... we still can't hear you.}
<A>__{but meagan isn't reading her report anymore, she's busy trying to push down her skirt when rip! the wind blows her skirt off. her classmates fall over themselves, laughing. rip! meagan's blouse blows away. she tries to hide behind the podium when that too is swept off. meagan clutches at her bra and panties as they start to drift away thread by thread. she is almost naked. meagan looks up at her classmates, red in the face. her classmates point and laugh only now they are all a bunch of old rotten skeletons. and up front, in the center where miss krepps sat... is freddy! he wears a beanie with a propeller, points and laughs:}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{aww... all dressed up and nowhere to blow!}
<A>__{meagan screams, clutching at the last few tiny strands of cloth that cover her body. she calls to jesse, pleading:}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{jesse... please, help me.}
<A>__{but jesse just sits at his desk dead. he reaches up and slowly lowers a hockey mask over his pale, expressionless face.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{looks like a photo opportunity to me!}
<A>__{freddy pulls out an over sized camera with a gargantuan flashgun attached. the flash bulb is the size of a beach ball and has a nuclear warning etched in the front. freddy sizes meagan up in the viewfinder and sneers:}
<C>__{freddy}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{say... cheesecake!}
<A>__{phoomph!!! the flash bulb goes off with an atomic light. meagan screams as her skeleton is blown back against the blackboard vaporized!}
