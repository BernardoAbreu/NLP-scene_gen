<A>__{utah, without a parachute, but carrying a very large gun, rockets downward. he presses his arms to his sides and falls head down, building speed. three hundred feet below him is bodhi, freefalling in a spread eagle position. utah moves his feet and hands, angling toward him. bodhi doesn't see him. falling flat, he tops out at terminal velocity for that position. 130 mph. utah slashes downward at 160 mph. the gap between them closes. utah is almost blinded by the windstream. his eyes burn. his lips are peeled back by the blasting air. bodhi is eighty feet below him... 4000 feet to terra firma. utah focuses all his incredible will and concentration. he's only going to have one shot at this. bodhi is right below him. utah is closing like a sam missile. he trims a little, and... wham! slams into bodhi in a mid air tackle. bodhi's eyes are wide with amazement as they tumble together. utah has made the grab and locked his arms around bodhi in an iron grip. he pulls the casull's muzzle up to bodhi's head and screams in his face.}
