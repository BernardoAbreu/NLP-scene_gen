<L>__{exterior shoveler's backyard day}
<A>__{a small, typical working class backyard. a round, aluminum above ground pool. a weber grill with burgers on it. unopened packages of hamburger rolls. an old vic damon record plays on a boom box. the spleen floats around on a rubber raft in the pool.}
<C>__{spleen}
<D>__{come on in! the water's great!}
<A>__{in fact, the water is turning a yellowish green... the rest of our heroes sit around on cheap folding chairs. no superheroes have shown up. the shoveler, at the grill, serves burgers to his kids, who stand in line waiting for them.}
<C>__{butch}
<P>__{(heavy on the sarcasm)}
<D>__{great picnic, dad.}
<C>__{eddie jr.}
<D>__{big turnout.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{are these guys real superheroes?}
<C>__{lenore}
<D>__{they think so.}
<A>__{the kids scoff... a moment later they head back to the house with their burgers.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{but where's captain amazing?}
<C>__{eddie jr.}
<D>__{he wouldn't be caught dead here.}
<A>__{they go into the house. no one says anything. the shoveler just stares at the burgers on the grill. vic damon sings. furious chugs his beer; he's working himself into a really morose mood. on the spleen, munching on a chlorine tablet.}
<C>__{spleen}
<D>__{hey, these pool mints are delicious!}
<A>__{raja looks at his watch.}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{maybe there was traffic.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{who are we kidding? no one's gonna show. we're living in a fantasy!}
<C>__{invisible boy}
<D>__{come on, guys we're fighting against evil.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{good or evil, what's the difference?}
<C>__{shoveler}
<D>__{there's a big difference.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{i used to believe that. now i'm not so sure.}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{roy, remember, it is all within your power. the only thing that's in your way... is you.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{oh shut up.}
<A>__{suddenly, there is a knock at the gate. everyone immediately perks up.}
<C>__{invisible boy}
<D>__{they're here!}
<A>__{a moment later they open the gate and see... half a dozen burly guys wearing various superhero outfits.}
<C>__{their leader}
<D>__{hey, man, is this the superhero wingding?}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{this is it. come on in!}
<C>__{superheroes}
<P>__{all right! party! (etc.)}
<A>__{at first glance these guys seem promising... but their outfits are decidedly improvised: weird goggles and sunglasses, shower curtain capes, baseball caps with beer cans on them. their leader holds a squeegee with a long handle... furious is suspicious.}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{i am the blue raja, master of silverware.}
<C>__{their leader}
<D>__{i am squeegee man, and these are my compadres, the invincible dudes!}
<A>__{the invincible dudes spot the keg.}
<C>__{invincible dudes}
<P>__{whoa! brews! party! (etc.)}
<A>__{they go immediately to the keg and start filling beer cups and guzzling them down. the raja tries to hand out some forms.}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{would you mind filling out these forms; names, addresses, description of superpowers, that sort of thing.}
<C>__{invincible dudes}
<P>__{sure, dude. no problem. (etc.) (but they just toss the forms away)}
<A>__{on furious, watching, starting to get pissed off.}
<C>__{invincible dude 1}
<D>__{hey, man, like where are the babes?}
<C>__{invincible dude 2}
<D>__{it said on the card there'd be babes!}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{actually we lied about the babes, but there's plenty of burgers.}
<C>__{invincible dudes}
<D>__{that's false advertising!... we came all the way from south champion, man! we coulda gone plinking!... we coulda gone bunqee jumping!}
<C>__{squeegee man}
<D>__{no babes. no peace.}
<C>__{invisible dudes }
<D>__{no babes no peace! no babes no peace! no babes no peace!}
<C>__{squeegee man}
<D>__{let's trash the place!}
<C>__{invincible dudes}
<D>__{yeah!}
<A>__{furious, fed up, confronts squeegee man.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{if you're a superhero, what's your power?}
<C>__{squeegee man}
<D>__{i am squeegee man.}
<P>__{(holding it out threateningly)}
<D>__{touch my squeegee... and you die.}
<A>__{the invincible dudes are cracking up.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{can you fly?}
<C>__{squeegee man}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{wanna bet?}
