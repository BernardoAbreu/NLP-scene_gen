<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i'm redefining 'weird' on an hourly basis. what were you thinking about when you started feeling anxious?}
<C>__{vitti}

<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i know. but usually when people draw a house they draw people. where are the people who live in your house?}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{well, you see, they'd come out and say hello, but the whole family's in the witness protection program. it's very sad. what the fuck you want from me?}
<A>__{they start walking.}
