<A>__{sid is back on the campus street, running down the middle of it. she spots a car stopped at a red light half a block up. kids are inside, rock music blares. sid screams and screams but they don't hear her. she runs, feet pounding, toward them but the light turns green and the car takes off. it's taillights fading in the night. she turns finding herself alone in a parking lot. the theatre sits in the distance. she spots someone entering the theatre. it looks like hallie.}
