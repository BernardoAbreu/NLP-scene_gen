<L>__{exterior mountain, flat rocky area night}
<A>__{a clap of thunder. lightning flashes reveal rain pouring down on the house. beneath it, carl and russell are kept dry, sitting around a pathetic flickering campfire. carl looks at dug, asleep, wrapped around the bird's leg. he rolls his eyes and looks up at the house.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{well, thanks for keeping us dry anyway, ellie.}
<C>__{russell }
<D>__{which one's the front?}
<A>__{russell struggles to set up the tent. he reads his manual.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{is this step three, or step five?}
<A>__{carl rolls his eyes at russell's ineptness.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{there!}
<A>__{russell struggles with a tent pole, trying to winch it into place. carl can't watch. an off screen smack! russell walks to carl. miraculously, he looks unscathed.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{all done.}
<A>__{russell turns, revealing a large red welt on his face.}
<C>__{russell}
<P>__{(pointing to tent)}
<D>__{that's for you!}
<A>__{the tent pole springs loose, catapulting the tent over the cliff.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{awh. tents are hard.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{wait, aren't you "super wilderness guy?" with the gpm's and the badges?}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{yeah, but... can i tell you a secret?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{alright, here goes. i never actually built a tent before. there. i said it.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{you've been camping before, haven't you?}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{well, never outside.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{well, why didn't you ask your dad how to build a tent?}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{i don't think he wants to talk about this stuff.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{why don't you try him sometime? maybe he'll surprise you.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{well, he's away a lot. i don't see him much.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{he's got to be home sometime.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{well, i called, but phyllis told me i bug him too much.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{phyllis? you call your own mother by her first name?}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{phyllis isn't my mom.}
<A>__{carl realizes he put his foot in it.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{the two sit silently together, watching the fire.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{but he promised he'd come to my explorer ceremony to pin on my assisting the elderly badge, so he can show me about tents then, right?}
<A>__{carl studies russell's sad optimism. he looks at the missing badge on russell's sash.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{hey, uh, why don't you get some sleep. don't want to wake up the traveling flea circus.}
<A>__{dug nuzzles around the sleeping bird's leg.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{mr. fredricksen, dug says he wants to take kevin prisoner. we have to protect him!}
<A>__{russell yawns and lies down on the rock next to carl.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{can kevin go with us?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{alright. he can come.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{promise you won't leave him?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{cross your heart?}
<A>__{carl looks down at russell.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{cross my heart.}
<A>__{carl sits at the campfire, the others asleep. he shakes his head and looks up at the house.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{what have i got myself into, ellie?}
