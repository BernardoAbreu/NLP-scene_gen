<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{int: convenience store. night}
<A>__{dante rearranges the milk. randal joins him.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{let me borrow your car.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i don't want to talk to you.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{fine. just lend me your car.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{why should i loan you my car?}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{i want to rent a movie.}
<C>__{dante}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you want to rent a movie.}
<A>__{dante walks away, shaking his head.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{what's that for?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{you work in a video store!}
<A>__{they head back to the counter.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{i work in a shitty video store. i want to go to a good video store so i can rent a good movie.}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{are you open?}
<C>__{dante and randal}
<P>__{(simultaneously)}
<D>__{yes!}
<A>__{the customer comes to the counter.}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{pack of cigarettes.}
<P>__{(pets cat)}
<D>__{cute cat. what's its name?}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{annoying customer.}
<A>__{the customer lets it sink in, and then leaves in a huff. dante puts up cigarettes.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time?}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{let me borrow your car.}
<C>__{dante}
<P>__{(calmer)}
<D>__{may i be blunt with you?}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{if you must.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{we are employees of quick stop convenience and rst video, respectively. as such, we have certain responsibilities which though it may seem cruel and unusual does include manning our posts until closing.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{i see. so playing hockey and attending wakes these practices are standard operating procedure.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{there's a difference. those were obligations. obligations that could not have been met at any later date. now renting videos that's just gratuitous, not to mention illogical, considering you work in a video store.}
<A>__{another customer leans in.}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{are you open?}
<C>__{dante}
<P>__{(rolls his eyes)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{you know what? i don't think i care for you rationale.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{it's going to have to do for now, considering that it's my car that's up for request.}
<P>__{(to customer)}
<D>__{can i help you?}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{pack of cigarettes.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{what's your point?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{my point is that you're a clerk, paid to do a job. you can't just do anything you want while you're working.}
<C>__{customer}
<P>__{(reading tabloid)}
<D>__{"space alien revealed as head of time warner; reports stock increase."}
<P>__{(to dante and randal)}
<D>__{they print any kind of shit in these papers.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{they certainly do. two fifty five.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{so your argument is that title dictates behavior?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{the reasons you won't let me borrow your care is because i have a title and a job description, and i'm supposed to follow it, right?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{exactly.}
<C>__{customer}
<P>__{(interjecting)}
<D>__{i saw one, one time, that said the world was ending the next week.}
<C>__{customer }
<D>__{then in the next week's paper, they said we were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a koala fish mutant bird. crazy shit.}
<C>__{randal}
<P>__{(eyes the customer, annoyed)}
<D>__{so i'm no more responsible for my own decisions while i'm here at work than, say, the death squad soldiers in bosnia?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{that's stretching it. you're not being asked to slay children or anything.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{not yet.}
<P>__{(sips water)}
<C>__{customer}
<P>__{(again with the interjections)}
<D>__{and i remember this one time the damn paper said...}
<A>__{randal spits a mist of water at the customer, drenching him. the man reacts violently, attempting to grab randal from over the counter. randal makes no move, but remains untouched. dante plays block.}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{i'm gonna break your fucking head! you fucking jerkoff!}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{sir! sir, i'm sorry! he didn't mean it! he was trying to get me.}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{well, he missed!}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i know. i'm sorry. let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.}
<C>__{customer}
<P>__{(considerably calmer; takes money)}
<D>__{this is the last time i ever come here.}
<P>__{(to randal)}
<D>__{and if i ever see you again, i'm gonna break your fucking head open!}
<A>__{the customer leaves, wiping water from his face. randal salutes him.}
<C>__{dante}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{what the fuck did you do that for?}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{two reasons: one, i hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{jesus!}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{and two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{if title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, i wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. but i did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. hence, even though i'm a clerk in this video store, i choose to go rent videos at big choice.}
<P>__{(extends opened palm)}
<D>__{agreed?}
<C>__{dante}
<P>__{(shakes his head; hands over keys)}
<D>__{you're a danger to both the dead and the living.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{i like to think i'm a master of my own destiny.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{please, get the hell out of here.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{i know i'm your hero.}
<A>__{randal exits.}
