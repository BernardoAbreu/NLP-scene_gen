<L>__{exterior the rooftops morning}
<A>__{xander looks around for a way out. the next building isn't that far away. he revs up and jumps across. anders jams another magazine into his sub machine gun and follows xander. they jump from roof to roof, down a descending series of rooftops towards the river. anders pulls up alongside as they race towards that last apartment building. neck and neck they head for the brink. at the last jump, xander pulls up behind anders. they hit the last roof in a crunch of gravel. anders clamps on the brakes and comes skidding to a stop, xander right behind him. they skid to a stop at the very edge, with anders balanced on his front wheel. he looks down, sees street five stories below. he glances back at xander, sweat beading, struggling to keep his balance. xander observes him coolly, totally in control. anders reaches for his machine gun. xander pops a wheelie and rams anders over the edge. the bike tumbles and pancakes into the pavement. anders tears through several awnings before slamming into the ground. xander turns and rides to the next apartment building. he hops down a steep series of roofs that will eventually take him to street level. as he makes his way down, anders stirs. the guy is a bloody, broken mess but he gets to his feet. he sees where xander is headed and he scurries off to intercept him.}
