<D>__{apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{which do you recommend?}
<C>__{mabel}
<D>__{the key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{i haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.}
<C>__{mabel}
<D>__{when ya had it, did ya like it?}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{no, but that don't mean much. i was a completely different person ten years ago. let's give key lime a day in court. and a large glass of milk.}
<A>__{mabel turns to her right.}
<C>__{mabel}
<P>__{(to someone o.s.)}
<D>__{should i make that two pieces?}
<A>__{camera pulls back and we see for the first time mallory knox, mickey's wife, sitting on a counter stool next to him. her back is to the camera as well.}

<C>__{mallory}
<D>__{whatever.}
<A>__{mallory hops from the stool, walks over and grabs the jar next to the cash register, then dumping out the coins on the counter, she selects a quarter.}
<C>__{mabel}
<D>__{hey, what the hell do you think you're doin'?}
<A>__{mallory saunters past the cowboy playing pinball. as his eyes follow mallory, he loses his ball. she walks to the jukebox in the back, inserts the quarter, selects a song, punches the buttons, a needle lands on a record, and a good god almighty rockabilly tune cuts through the coffee shop. mabel brings mickey his pie and milk.}
<C>__{mabel}
<P>__{(to mickey)}
<D>__{she ought not be doing that. that's for jerry's kids, not rock 'n roll.}
<A>__{camera moves around to a cu of mickey. this is the first time we see him. as he takes a bite of green pie:}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{i can't take her anywhere.}
<A>__{mallory starts doing a slow seductive fandango around the coffee shop. she's really cooking and smoking. pinball cowboy and mabel are starting to wonder just who the hell these people are. mickey isn't paying much attention. he's too busy enjoying his pie and milk.}
<L>__{exterior coffee shop day}
<A>__{a dirty pickup truck, sporting a confederate flag decal, pulls up to the coffee shop. sonny, otis, and earl, three tough looking rednecks, pile out. steam rises from beneath the pickup's hood.}

<D>__{goddamn this sumbitch is runnin' hot. y'all go inside. i'm gonna check 'er out.}
<L>__{interior coffee shop day}
<A>__{the loudness of the rockabilly song slaps sonny and otis in their faces as they walk inside the door. the sexy sight of mallory doing the ubang stomp stops them in their tracks.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{good god almighty. what the hell is that?}
<C>__{otis}
<D>__{that's a bitch outta hell, son.}
<A>__{otis and sonny exchange looks.}

<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{miller, mabel.}
<C>__{mabel}
<D>__{comin' up.}
<A>__{otis stands in front of mallory, trying to copy what she's doing. her eyes are closed at the moment, so she doesn't see him. mabel sets the miller down in front of sonny. sonny takes a swig, enjoying the floor show.}
<C>__{sonny}
<P>__{(to mickey)}
<D>__{that's some sweet piece of meat, ain't it?}
<A>__{mickey turns from his pie and looks at sonny. his expression betrays nothing.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{her name's mallory.}
<A>__{the needle lifts off the record. the song ends. mallory opens her eyes and sees otis.}
<C>__{otis}
<D>__{hells bells! don't stop now sugar. i'm just getting warmed up.}
<A>__{otis gives her his best shit eating grin before turning to sonny. sonny gurgles out a laugh.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{hey, i think she's sweet on you.}
<A>__{otis turns to mallory as she punches him hard in the face spinning him around. sonny spews his mouthful of highlife. mallory grabs the back of otis' head and smashes it down on the table, cracking the linoleum. otis buckles, dropping to his knees. sonny jumps off the counter stool, but mickey's hand clutches hold of his shoulder. sonny spins around toward mickey, loaded for bear, and points his finger at him, threateningly. before any threat can be made, mickey whips a large buck knife out from its sheath, and in a flash, slices off sonny's finger. sonny's finger drops on his boot. he grabs his aching hand. blood flows from the wound.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{just because my woman's mopping up the floor with your buddy is no reason for you to join in.}
<A>__{mickey makes five lightning quick slashing swings. the buck knife slips back into its sheath. at first, there seems to be no difference with sonny. finally, blood flows from the slices made in his face and chest. sonny collapses. the short order cook charges out of the kitchen at mickey, wielding a meat cleaver and screaming. mickey whips out a .45 automatic from a shoulder holster inside his jacket and fires. bullet's pov: heading fast toward short order cook's face. it hits. short order cook puts his hands to his face and falls to the ground, screaming. mickey spots earl, who's standing outside the plate glass window. earl's watched the whole shebang. earl mouths 'fuck!' he turns and runs for it. mickey hurls the knife through the plate glass window, which shatters. the knife plunges deep into earls back. he hits the ground dead. mickey turns to mallory. she's sitting on op of otis, slamming his head repeatedly on the floor.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{honey.}
<A>__{mallory looks up at mickey. she gets off otis and moves to mickey's side. mickey trains his .45 on pinball cowboy, who's shaking in his cowboy boots. mickey aims at mabel, who's clutching the coffee pot, crying.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(to mallory)}
<D>__{pick one.}
<A>__{mallory does eanie, meanie, minie, moe, pointing back and forth from mabel to pinball cowboy.}
<C>__{mallory}
<D>__{eanie, meanie, minie, moe, catch a nigger by the tow. if he hollers, let him go. eanie, meanie, minie, moe. my mom told me to pick the best one and you are it.}
<A>__{she ends, pointing at mabel. mabel's crying. she screams.}
<C>__{mabel}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{mickey fires the .45. the bullet chinks through the coffee pot mabel's holding and explodes, thunking her in the chest. she hits the floor dead. mickey and mallory join hands and walk over to the pinball cowboy who stands in a pool of his own urine.}
<C>__{mallory}
<D>__{when you tell people what went on here, tell 'em mickey and mallory knox did this. understand?}
<A>__{pinball cowboy nods yes. the two killers plant a big wet kiss on each other's mouths. then, holding hands, mickey and mallory walk out of the cafe.}

<A>__{wayne shuts off the recorder, rewinds and plays it back. it works beautifully. he hits the record button and conceals the recorder in his sport coat jacket. the door opens on the prisoner side and mickey knox is lead into the room by two sheriff's deputies. mickey's wearing the country jail blue jump suit. he has a thick and wide leather belt around his waist with a metal ring built into each side. long sturdy chains with handcuffs on each end are wrapped across his body and through the rings, binding his arms to his sides. his hands and feet are double cuffed. the deputies both have their guns drawn, ready to blow mickey in half at the slightest provocation. for a man wrapped and bound in chains, mickey seems strangely in control of his environment. even restrained as he is by the symbols of society (the chains, jail, guards, guns, jump suit), he remains a dangerous, intimidating, and fascinating figure. wayne takes in the image of mickey.}

<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{showtime.}

<D>__{we've been waiting to do a follow up episode on you for a long time. and that time has definitely come.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i feel it's apparent to anyone who's hip to what's going on that the prison board has thrown the constitution straight out the fuckin' window. you and mallory may be killers, but you're not insane. you belong in a prison, not in an asylum. the prison board is blatantly railroading you into a hospital for the sole purpose of turning you into vegetables. now some people are saying, 'so what?' i am not one of those people. if we avert our eyes while they do this to you, we give them permission to do it again whenever they see fit. today they wipe clean your mind because they feel your actions are dangerous, tomorrow they wipe clean my mind because they feel what i say is dangerous. where does it all stop?}
<A>__{no response from mickey.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{my problem mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. i'm all alone on this. i need your help. i want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. now i have interviews with chairman of the prison board dewight mcclusky about this issue. and i'm tellin' ya, mickey, he looks bad. the two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. i have an interview with both the judge of your trial, bert steinsma, and the psychologist and author, emil reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. you put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. but the network isn't satisfied. they feel the show needs another element. it needs you. in order to put the show on the air, i need to get an interview with you. you haven't talked to the press since your trial. now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with wayne gayle. we're talkin' a media event here. every son of a bitch out the with a tv set's gonna tune in to see that. we'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. at least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and mallory lobotomies. well, whatta ya say?}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{have you talked to mallory about this?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{she won't even see me, mickey. now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but i'm gonna tell ya somethin'. since you two've been sentenced, mallory hasn't spoken one word.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{she doesn't talk?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{not to anybody. she sings.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{she sings? what does she sing?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{songs. 'he's a rebel', 'leader of the pack', 'town without pity', that dusty springfield song 'i only want to be with you'. that's what i hear anyway. her behaviour was the main thing the doctors' report used against you. so even if she would see me, which she won't, i couldn't put her on camera anyway. if i ask her, 'mallory, are you insane?' and she starts singing 'dead skunk in the middle of the road', that blows our whole case.}
<A>__{mickey cracks a smile. the guards come over to take him away.}

<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{was there any vengeance on your part with your unique sentence?}
<C>__{judge steinsma}
<D>__{yes, unquestionably. after they did what they did in my court, and judge worth his robe will tell you the same thing. it couldn't help but affect my decision. that's why they have judges. we're supposed to be fair to a fault, but when it's showtime, we have to make a decision. that's why we don't just input all the facts into a computer for the appropriate punishment. i couldn't give them the death penalty. see, california hops back and forth on that issue. mickey and mallory went to court when it was out of favor, which is actually good because it leaves more room for imagination. anybody can give somebody the chair. when you have someone who deserves to die and you can't kill them, you have to be creative. and if the bastards had let it stand, it would of been the perfect sentence. it hit 'em right where they lived. far more punishing than the death sentence.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{would you please describe for our viewers what your sentence was?}
<C>__{judge steinsma}
<D>__{well, in a rogue's gallery of killers, mickey and mallory are very unique. i've seen a lot of killers in my day and they're a very cold lot. they have no more feelings about taking a person's life than squashing a tiny bug. it's all the same to them. well, mickey and mallory were that 'kill 'em to watch their expression change' attitude personified. except with each other. and, since they lived only for each other, i wanted to attack that, at its very root. so, in a nutshell, my sentence was double life for each without any possibility for parole. that would be fairly standard in their case. the twist i added was that the husband and wife would have no contact or correspondence with each other for the rest of their lives. and they would never receive any word or information about the other. so, basically once the cell door slams shut, mickey and mallory will completely disappear from each other's life. they'll never know when the other dies. but alas, the best laid plans of mice and men...}

<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{mickey and mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. i'm confused. what's changed?}

<C>__{mcclusky}
<D>__{what's changed, mr. gayle, is our minds. we felt they were competent a year ago. a year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.}

<D>__{it's a funny situation actually. if anyone besides mickey and mallory give a damn, what the prison board is doing would be considered an outrage. the prison board is basically saying, 'we can't handle these guys.' they've moved 'em around twice since their sentence started. they were a handful everywhere they went. now the prisons they're at now want them outta there. but no other prison's gonna be stupid enough to take 'em. so the prison board is left scratching their heads wondering what they're gonna do. well, what they decided to do was to set up a kangaroo medical court that found them crazy. then they get them transferred to nystrom medical asylum or lobotomy bay as it's referred to in the psychiatric circle. put 'em on a strict dope and electro shock diet, and mickey and mallory cease to be a problem to anybody except the orderlies who clean out the bedpans, which if you want to see them get theirs, that's all well and good. but there's something being said here. forget the immorality for a second. forget the corruption and the skulduggery involved. what the board is saying is 'we give up.' mickey and mallory ran amuck in polite society. they were put in an alternative society and they ran amuck there, too. all the powers that be, can't deal with these two kids. and whatever can't be assimilated has to be terminated.}

<A>__{duncan nods frantically.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{mickey grabs duncan and the caravan starts running down the stairs. they go down a few flights. as they run down one last flight, they find wurlitzer and a team of deputies waiting for them on the ground floor. the deputies raise their guns. mallory grabs hold of wayne, and gets behind him with one hand pressing the barrel of her gun against his temple and her other are wrapped around his neck, holding him close to her.}
<C>__{mallory}
<D>__{back off or i will blast him! back off or i will blast him! back off or i will blast him!}
<A>__{none of the deputies lower their guns, but they appear less likely to start shooting. wayne screams.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{don't shoot. i beg you, don't shoot! please, please, please...}
<A>__{wayne continues begging. wurlitzer steps forward.}
<C>__{wurlitzer}
<D>__{now mickey, mallory, just let me say }
<C>__{mallory}
<D>__{shut up! don't talk, i don't wanna hear it!}
<C>__{wurlitzer}
<D>__{you have to know }
<C>__{mallory}
<D>__{i said shut up...}
<A>__{mallory quickly lowers her gun from wayne's head and shoots him in the thigh. she whips the gun back up to his head. wayne's screaming in pain. the deputies jump back.}
<C>__{mallory}
<D>__{...and i mean shut up!}
<A>__{there's a bit of a silent standoff. tears are streaming down duncan's face as the caravan slowly retreats back up the stairs to the next flight. the deputies hold their present position.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior prison stairwell day}
<A>__{the caravan goes up one flight, then stops. mickey and mallory let their two hostages sit down. duncan is out and out hysterical, urine stains the front of his uniform. mickey's pacing.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{think...think...think...}
<A>__{mallory leans up against the wall, holding her side with her hand. blood trickles out between the fingers. we see now she's been shot. over duncan's impassioned clamour they can hear wurlitzer yelling from below.}
<C>__{wurlitzer }
<D>__{give up! there's no other way out!}
<A>__{mickey sits down, utterly exhausted. mallory sits down next to. him. she winces in pain. he puts his arm around her.}
<C>__{mallory}
<D>__{look, lover boy, we're not getting outta here. so i say the hell with going back to our cells. let's do a butch cassidy and the sundance kid. run down these stairs shootin', go out in a hail of bullets, but take as many of those motherfuckers with us as possible.}
<A>__{suddenly, mickey's exhaustion lifts. he has a plan.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{we'll do that when all else fails.}
<A>__{mickey stands.}
<C>__{mallory}
<D>__{hasn't it?}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{we still got a few tricks up our sleeves.}

<D>__{oh, i don't wanna die...}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{are you married? do you have kids?}
<A>__{duncan nods pathetically.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{good. people, we're goin' all the way to the front door. now, the only way we're gonna get there is if they don't want to kill you two more than they want to kill us.}
<T>__{insert:}
<A>__{shots of deputies with guns in their hands, just itching to kill mickey and mallory. we hear mickey's voice over this shot.}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{right now i find that highly unlikely. so, let's help 'em out, shall we?}
<T>__{back to prison stairwell:}
<A>__{mickey is squatting in front of wayne.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{now, say i tell those guys down there if they shoot or make a move, i'm killin' wayne gayle. and they shoot or make a move anyway. now say by some freak accident, you didn't die, you live though it. what would you do?}
<A>__{mickey pulls the roll of gaffer's tape from his shirt and starts tearing strips of tape and sticking them to the wall.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{what would i do? me and my network would sue the entire los angeles county sheriffs department for flagrantly disregarding my safety. i'd go straight to my buddy, the mayor, and make sure everyone of those son of a bitches down there ends up on the unemployment line. in fact, i'd sue every man down there personally. i would make it my life's ambition to bring the la county jail to its knees. i would do expose after expose on the brutality, and the conditions, and the inhumanity that exists here.}
<A>__{mickey tosses the tape roll to mallory and gestures to duncan. mallory winks at mickey. mickey smiles and begins wrapping tape around the barrel of his shotgun.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{that's what i thought. you tell them that. when we go down those stairs, i want you to scream what you just told me. 'my name is wayne gayle! i am the star of american maniacs watched every week by' how many people?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{on average forty million.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{'every week by forty million people. i am a respected journalist.' have you won any awards?}

<D>__{are you kidding? the golden globe, the edward r. murrow award...}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{'respected journalist' on your knees...}
<A>__{wayne kneels in front of mickey. while mickey speaks he props his shotgun under wayne's chin and wraps the tape from the barrel around his neck.}

<D>__{...'winner of the golden globe and the edward r. murrow award among others.' tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer, his firm, his address, and phone number. tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines. you getting the idea?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{mickey stands with wayne as he tapes his trigger hand to the stock of the shotgun.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{say it. scream it. all the way out the front door and into your van. and if you stop screaming, i swear to god i will blow your head off.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{got it.}
<A>__{mickey grabs the camera, and lifts it to his shoulder before shouting to duncan.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{you! what's your name?}
<A>__{duncan can't answer, mallory has gagged him with his tape. mallory grabs duncan by the collar and lifts him off the floor before reading his name badge.}

<D>__{start.}
<A>__{wayne and duncan come into view with the knoxs behind them. the deputies quickly raise their guns, but soon realize if they take out either mickey of mallory that wayne or duncan would die. mallory's right hand is taped to the trigger and stock of the shotgun that's wrapped firmly to duncan's neck. the pistol in her left hand is trained on wurlitzer. mickey's left hand masters the shotgun leash on wayne, while he monitors the deputies with the camera on his right shoulder. note: the following scene will intercut between video footage and color 35mm. wayne starts belting out his speech as mickey focus the camera on wurlitzer. duncan simply cries and begs for his life to be spared.}

<A>__{mickey knew what he was doing. this has an effect on the deputies.}
<C>__{mallory}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{make a path!}
<A>__{the wall of deputies starts moving backward. the knoxs and their hostages start moving forward with wayne yelling all the way. the deputies keep their guns trained on the caravan, but they keep giving ground, until they reach the doors of the front lobby and they begin to part like the red sea. wurlitzer stands his ground.}
<C>__{wurlitzer}
<D>__{how far do you think your gonna get?}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{right out the front door.}
<C>__{wurlitzer}
<D>__{that'll never happen.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{it is happening.}
<A>__{the caravan marches forth. wayne and duncan keep shouting their speeches. nobody dares to move on them, but the deputies keep their weapons ready. wayne stops his speech to take a breath.}
<C>__{mallory}
<D>__{don't stop!}
<A>__{wayne starts up again. the deputies are completely frustrated. mickey and wurlitzer are nose to nose.}

<B>__{leader.}
<L>__{exterior woods day}
<A>__{the white leader is disrupted by a fogged image in black & white. the image settles into a ecu of wayne. he's being filmed by a 16mm camera that he is presently balancing on a fence post. this entire scene is played out cinema verite. the sound is not in sync as wayne steps back into a med shot. he looks directly into the camera.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{this is wayne gayle. i'm wounded and my crew, roger and scott, are dead. this may be out of sync 'cause we are shooting with a wild camera and a standard recorder we found in the van. mickey knox's plan worked. we walked out the front door, into my news van and made our getaway. when we were followed by patrol cars, mallory knox killed deputy sheriff duncan homolka and tossed his body out of the back. mickey told authorities over my police band that i would surely be next if they didn't give up the pursuit. they took mickey at his word and called off the pursuit. why helicopters weren't employed, i don't know. my only thought is it all happened too fast for arrangements to be made. we've just pulled off to the side of the road to do this interview. tensions run high }
<A>__{mickey screams o.s.}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{we ain't got all fuckin' day!}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{without any further ado, mickey and mallory...}

<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{mallory, what did you think of mickey's plan? did you think it would work?}
<C>__{mallory}
<D>__{it wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that i totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. when we got out of the stairwell, i remember thinking, 'oh my god. this might work.' but mickey knew it would work all along. there wasn't any doubt in his mind. it's not like there was and he just didn't show it. he knew it would work.}
<C>__{wayne }
<D>__{what did you think then?}
<C>__{mallory}
<D>__{i wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. and i wondered if i could wait that long.}
<C>__{wayne }
<D>__{did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?}
<C>__{mallory}
<D>__{haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word i said? ...oh, i'm sorry. can i say fuckin'? i can't, can i?}
<C>__{wayne }
<D>__{try to keep it to a minimum.}
<C>__{mallory}
<D>__{we had nothing to do with that riot. that riot was just whatchmacallit }
<A>__{mickey can be heard faintly in the b.g.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{divine intervention.}
<C>__{mallory}
<D>__{what he said. we didn't know jack shit about and riot. it just happened. it was kismet. we didn't even know those people. how are we supposed to organize a riot when we've been in fuckin' isolation for the past year? just bleep out the fucks and jack shits.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i mean, it's not like we care. if they wanna say we masterminded the whole thing, let 'em. it won't exactly keep us up at night. but you said you wanted the truth, and the truth is we were just lucky.}
<A>__{mickey's snapping his fingers in the b.g.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{c'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.}
<C>__{wayne }
<D>__{so, what now?}
<C>__{mallory}
<D>__{well, now me and mickey are gonna take it easy. just enjoy each other's company, stop and smell the roses, notice the color purple, stuff like that.}
<C>__{wayne }
<D>__{how do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in america.}
<C>__{mallory}
<D>__{well, back in slave times they had a thing called the underground railroad. and we got a whole fan club out there just waiting to be conductors.}
<P>__{(to the camera)}
<D>__{so, you kids out there, keep the faith. cause mickey and mallory will be comin' to your town real soon.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{okay, that's enough. end of interview. we gotta move.}
<A>__{mickey approaches wayne. camera goes a little haywire as wayne lowers it from his eye.}
<C>__{wayne }
<D>__{okay, just let me swing around and film myself asking the questions. and then i will do my little wrap up.}
<A>__{mickey takes the camera from wayne, and while he speaks, he balances it on a fence post.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{oh, we're gonna do a little wrap up, all right. but it won't be you starin' in the camera, looking dumb, and acting stupid. instead, you're gonna be starin' down the barrels of our shotguns and we're gonna be pullin' the triggers.}
<A>__{wayne forces a chuckle. mickey steps away from the camera and into a three shot. the news van is parked in the b.g.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{that's a joke right?}
<A>__{mickey pumps the slide of his shotgun. mallory grabs her shotgun from off the ground.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{just wait one fucking minute.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{i said i'd give you a interview. now unless i'm mistaken, we just did a interview.}
<P>__{(to mallory)}
<D>__{we did an interview, didn't we?}
<C>__{mallory}
<D>__{looked like an interview to me.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{i said we'd give you an interview. i never said we wouldn't kill you.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{wait! i don't know, but i kinda felt during this...this whole escape that a kind of bond }
<A>__{wayne is shaking.}
<C>__{wayne}

<D>__{no. not really.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{don't touch those triggers! please. i think i've already proven that a live wayne gayle is much more better that a dead...way gayle. i was your passport out of jail, not duncan homolka. but me! i will be your passport outta }
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{just save your breath, wayne. we hate you. if anybody in the fuckin' world deserves to die, it's you.}

<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{wait! you can't kill me. mickey and mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale.}

<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{no!!!}
<A>__{the two interview subjects start pumping rounds into wayne, who's body dances like a puppet before collapsing to the ground. mickey and mallory kiss each other passionately, then climbing into the news van, they drive away. wayne's body lay peacefully in frame until the camera eventually runs out of film.}
