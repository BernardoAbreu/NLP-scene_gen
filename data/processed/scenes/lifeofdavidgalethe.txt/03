<A>__{the office is small, cheaply furnished. one wall is filled with neat rows of 8x10's of death row inmates. about 30 percent have red crosses over their faces. five people wait in tense silence. a skinny college guy with a mullet and pinch of skoal in his mouth looks at a computer screen. a co ed cuddles a styrofoam cup of coffee, sobs quietly. a matronly woman sits quietly at a desk holding a phone to one ear. the clock's minute hand changes from :11 to :12. constance harraway (36), bookish, sits beside david gale (31). he wears a blue yale sweatshirt. they both stare at nothing. she bites her lip.}
