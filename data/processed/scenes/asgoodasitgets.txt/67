<L>__{interior new york apartment building hallway night}
<A>__{as carol passes simon's door... stands in front of melvin's apartment twists herself to ease nervousness and knocks on the door... then rings the bell. finally carol hears muffled throat clearing on the other side of the door.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{uh, udall?}
<C>__{melvin }
<D>__{carol the waitress?}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{as we hear him unlock the door, carol looks at her breasts and gasps. she grasps the fabric and holds it straight out just as melvin opens the door. his hair is static city, standing on end as he periodically gives it self conscious pats.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{the doctors had your billing address. i'm sorry about the hour.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{i was working... can't you just drop me a thank you note?}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{that's not why i'm here...}
<P>__{(tearing suddenly)}
<D>__{... though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about spencer...}
<C>__{melvin}
<P>__{(very uncomfortable)}
<D>__{note. put it in the note.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{why did yo do this for me?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{to get you back at work so you can wait on me.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{but you do have some idea how strange that sounds??? i'm worried that you did this because...}
<A>__{she pauses the beginning of an extraordinarily long silence. finally.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{you waiting for me to say something?}
<P>__{(as she shakes her head)}
<D>__{what sort of thing do you want? look, i will be at the restaurant tomorrow.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{i don't think i can wait until tomorrow. this needs clearing up.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{what needs clearing up?}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(strong and true)}
<D>__{i'm not going to sleep with you. i will never, ever sleep with you. never. not ever.}
<A>__{melvin's reaction? well, he'll never get credit for the brief but intense inner struggle the struggle not to scream not to cry to process the sudden and stunning hurt during his half turn away from her and then answer hoarsely.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{i'm sorry. we don't open for the no sex oaths until 9 a.m.}
<A>__{carol is amused, surprised... maybe, in some small way ever taken by his style... but top priority is clarity.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{i'm not kidding.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{okay!!!! anything else?!?}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{just how grateful i am.}
<A>__{her mission completed she turns.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{so you'll be at work?}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{yes.}
