<L>__{interior julie's bedroom night}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{well? where the hell are you?}
<L>__{intercut between ted and julie:}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{he's on the move?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i got an anonymous tip and an address in cincinnati.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{let's do it.}
<A>__{ted's luxurious hotel suite living room that moment ted hangs up the phone. looks around. jimmy's gone. but his shiny new bike is left behind.}
<L>__{interior cincinnati nightclub night}
<A>__{not much of a place. a middle aged torch singer croons "my romance." ted and julie find their way to corner table. keeping an eye out for principal merkin.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i don't know. this place seems pretty tame.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{you expected whips, chains, merk being cattle prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{at least it's not another 4 h meeting or a big brother barbecue.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{amen to that.}
<A>__{their heads are very close together. a conspiratorial tete a tete.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{look at us. it's one o'clock in the morning, on a school night. we're in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i'm trembling with excitement.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{that has more to do with your proximity to me.}
<C>__{julie}
<P>__{(playing along)}
<D>__{my desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i have a bit of a goosebump fetish. not many people know that.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{shoes, if you want to know the truth. shoes are my thing.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{wearing them? or humping them?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{my fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a timex and suede clogs.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{that's refreshingly deviant.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{what about you?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i'm very aural.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{tell me more.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{sounds, voices, music, humming. all of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(feigning a deep voice)}
<D>__{i see.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i had a portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(jealous)}
<D>__{a portuguese boyfriend. sounds very "cosmo."}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{you live and learn. i realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? i saw that one coming.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{you lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.}
<A>__{at that moment, the torch singer begins crooning "people."}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{do you trust me, julie?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{not a chance.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{come on.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{trust is something you earn, over time. you don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire.}
<A>__{ted leans even closer. looking into her eyes. using his voice. being as aurally seductive as he can.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i want you to trust me.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{maybe someday.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{julie, i will tell you something that is the god's honest truth. i've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. i mean a lot. but none of them make me feel like you do.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{that's hard to believe.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{but absolutely true.}
<A>__{ted moves closer. julie doesn't move away. the singer seems to be performing just for them.}
<C>__{singer }
<D>__{..."a feeling deep in your soul says you were half, now you're whole..."}
<A>__{just as ted and julie are about to kiss, julie's eyes widen. she grabs ted's hand. simultaneously, they turn towards the}
<B>__{singer...}
<D>__{julie & ted oh. my. god.}
<A>__{it's the mother lode! that's not just any middle aged torch singer. that's principal merkin. dressed in drag as barbra streisand. and doing a mighty fine job of it. ted pulls out his camera and fires away. blinded by the stage lights, principal merkin sings and vogues glamorously. he has no idea his secret is out.}
