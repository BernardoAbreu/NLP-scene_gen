<A>__{the fullness of day over old woman butte, hot and bright. chasing the night and its fears away under the punishing glare of noon. the village is full of police vehicles now. green broncos from the navaho tribal police. blue and white sheriff department sedans. the navaho cops are talking with katherine and mary. thomas is sitting on the trunk of a patrol car getting his wounds properly bandaged as the sheriff we met earlier leans beside him chewing on a wild oat stalk.}
