<L>__{interior north korean consulate surveillance room day}
<A>__{everyone is painfully on edge. ambassador han paces. the fbi agents are on a phone or a radio, working leads. colonel lee mutters something to ambassador han in korean.}
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{say what?}
<C>__{colonel lee}
<D>__{perhaps someone will decide it is foolish to incur the wrath of north korea.}
<C>__{carson}
<P>__{(crosses to colonel lee)}

<C>__{carson}
<D>__{let's grab a few beers, kick back 'til five o'clock rolls by. then maybe we can have a war over it. i think that's a great idea, seeing as how you fuckers have needed your clocks cleaned for fifty years now!}
<C>__{colonel lee}
<P>__{(gets up)}
<D>__{why wait until five?}
<A>__{ambassador han and walther keep carson and colonel lee from going at each other.}

<D>__{pete!}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{christ, you're self indulgent! there's nothing but anger and cynicism left inside you, so they're all you can express any more. no wonder everyone in the bureau thinks you're such a nutcase!}
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{hey, i'm not the only one with a rep around the office... "dr. knoll it all."}
<C>__{miranda}
<P>__{(hurt)}
