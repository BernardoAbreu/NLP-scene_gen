<L>__{ext atlantic city racetrack afternoon}
<A>__{stands mobbed with people, horses galloping down the track, dust rising in their wake. moving in on...}
<L>__{ext stands afternoon}
<A>__{surrounded by people cheering, cass is hard at work. notebook open, phone to ear, lap holding the plain envelope, ripped open, contents exposed: a piece of paper that says: "atlantic city. xmas eve. sparrow." she has underlined "sparrow" and made a list: "person's name? company? hotel? casino?"}
<C>__{cass}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{no one with that name? what about a casino? nothing? thanks.}
<A>__{she clicks over to an incoming call, "private caller":}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{jimmy?}
<A>__{split screen: stewart, at the mobbed track entrance, lost and frustrated:}
<C>__{stewart}
<D>__{no, who's jimmy?}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{look, stewart, i'm busy.}
<C>__{stewart}
<D>__{ok. (casually) where are you, by the way? i mean, exactly.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{i'm in miami, if you must know. i'm on the beach building a sand castle and drinking from a coconut...}
<A>__{someone taps her shoulder. she glances up and sees: milo, sitting right next to her, grinning. she slowly closes her phone, not bothering to say goodbye.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{hello, cass.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{hello, milo.}
<A>__{a million different emotions cross cass' face. surprise, anger, anxiousness. all the mixed emotions you have when you suddenly run into the man who broke your heart.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{fancy meeting you here.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{yeah. fancy that.}
<A>__{strange, charged moment as they look at each other. then they have a casual contest:}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{how are you?}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{fine. you?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{swell. nice day.}
<C>__{cass}

<C>__{milo}
<D>__{brisk.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{crisp.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{invigorating.}
<C>__{cass}
<P>__{(can't hold out anymore)}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<A>__{milo smirks.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{"building a sand castle, drinking from a coconut". man, once a liar, always a liar.}
<A>__{cass immediately stands.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{you know what? i don't have time for this, i'm working.}
<A>__{she grabs her stuff. milo blocks her with his leg.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{working? hey, me too.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{congratulations. move your leg.}
<A>__{milo doesn't budge. spelling it out for her:}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{what i do is, i track down criminals. people who jumped bail. idiots who decided to go on the run after biting police officers. i find them, and i take them to jail.}
<A>__{cass stares at him, eyes wide:}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{now, hold on just a second, milo...}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{tell you what: i will give you more than a second. i will give you 10. for old times sake.}
<A>__{milo moves his leg, kicks back, starts to count.}
<C>__{milo}
<A>__{..9...8... cass stares at him, her jaw working, trying to decide what to do. then, all of a sudden, she bolts. milo smiles. the loudspeakers announce: "and they're off!"}
