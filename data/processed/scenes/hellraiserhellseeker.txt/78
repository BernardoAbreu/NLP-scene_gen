<L>__{exterior bus stop night}
<A>__{trevor steps out of the bus and faces the roman catholic cathedral. he ascends the steps.}
<L>__{interior confessional night}
<A>__{trevor sits in the booth across from the tiny screen, behind which is a very tired priest who is still in his pajamas.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{i don't know what i'm doing here. i'm not even catholic. i just had to tell somebody. it's like, ever since my wife died i don't know what i've actually done or what i've imagined. but i do know if one tenth of what's happening to me is reality... i've done some really awful things in my life. things that i've... i guess i've blocked out...}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{what things do you think you've done?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{wow. let's see. so many sins so little time. for starters i was responsible for the death my wife who by the way was carrying my unborn child. that was so i could collect her eight million dollar estate. i think i killed several women i was having mindless sex with behind her back.}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{but i did those murders just for the hell of it. finally... i think i made some kind of deal with the devil and now he's come to collect my soul. only he's decided to mess with my head first. how many hail marys do you recommend for that one father?}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{trevor i'm sure you killed no one. you are very distraught over your wife's death and rightfully so. you did the right thing by confessing to me here tonight. and you should keep praying for the wisdom that will set your soul at ease. that being said, you are still in a highly emotional state right now. it might do you some good to get some professional help. confess to them the way you confessed to me. in time you'll probably find that the real killer has already been caught. or better yet... that these murders never happened at all.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{but i saw these women. i saw their mutilated bodies. i saw their ghosts. i just know it happened i can feel it...}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{all you've got is the here and the now trevor. that's all anyone really has. maybe this will make things easier to understand. a man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. in time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. and at the end of the day does it even matter? all these events you're describing. how can you be sure any of them really happened?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{but that's what i need. to be sure... to be absolutely sure...}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{shh. it's okay son. there is but one truth. one thing you can be absolutely sure of. and that thing is this:}
<A>__{the priest moves closer to the screen.}
<C>__{priest }
<D>__{we're all here for you trevor.}
<A>__{the priest begins to chuckle ominously. resisting the urge to scream trevor bolts out of the confessional...}
