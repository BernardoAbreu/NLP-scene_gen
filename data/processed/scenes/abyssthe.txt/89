<A>__{the missile compartment is the large gallery a hundred and twenty feet long and forty feet high, with two rows of vertical launch tubes, 24 in all. the chamber is divided into three levels by a floor of open steel grillwork.}
<C>__{jammer}
<D>__{where are we?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{missile compartment. those are the launch tubes.}
<A>__{they sweep their lights around the chamber. jammer turns... his beam illuminating a body just beyond the door. a coveralled seaman turning slowly in the eddying current. small albino crabs crawl slowly over the man's face. one scuttles out of his gaping mouth.}
<C>__{jammer}
<D>__{lord almighty.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{hey, you okay?}
<A>__{bud goes to him. gets up close to his face. sees that he's not. that he's hyperventilating. fighting nausea. bud grabs him by the shoulders.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{deep and slow, big guy. deep and slow. just breathe easy.}
<C>__{jammer}
<D>__{i... they're all dead, bud. they're all dead. i thought... some of them... you know...}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i'm taking you back out.}
<C>__{jammer}
<D>__{no! i'm okay now. i just don't... i can't go any further in.}
<A>__{bud sees that the big diver's breathing has stabilized. he looks at his watch. checker jammer's pressure gauges.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{okay, jammer. no problem. you stay right here. i have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights. we'll stay in voice contact. just hold onto the rope. five more minutes. okay?}
<C>__{jammer}
<D>__{yeah, okay. okay.}
<A>__{he moves off through the center aisle of the gallery swimming between the huge cylinders. he pays out the lifeline as he goes.}
