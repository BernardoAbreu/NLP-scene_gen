<A>__{tommy flashes a newspaper article in front of her. one we've seen eariler: "michael myers dead of alive?" the baby's screams are verging on overload. tommy dashes to the recessed kitchen area and heats up another bottle. as kara reads, danny tugs at his mother's blouse.}

<D>__{ second. there you go, big guy.}
<A>__{kara looks on as tommy attempts to feed the baby. despite his clumsiness, she's undeniably moved. behind them, danny's imagination kicks into high gear as he drives a power ranger over an invisible race track. on the floor. across the windowsill. glancing across the street. danny's p.o.v. the myers house standing below on the front lawn is the shape, silhouetted under a moonlit tree. looking right at danny.}
