<A>__{yellow warning lights pulse. those goddamned strobes are flickering on and off. steam blasts out overhead pipes. the blue spark pilot light muzzles of a flame thrower shyly pokes out from behind a console. it's owner cautiously follows...}
<B>__{ripley}
<A>__{she's breathing heavy. she's wearing a sweat soaked tank top. her eyes flit from side to side. then up. then down. she pokes the weapon out ahead of her and moves into the pod. she silently crosses the distance to newt's sleep tube:}
<B>__{in the tube}
<A>__{newt sleeps peacefully. ripley allows herself one maternal smile, then remembers. her grip tightens in the flame thrower in her hands. she flips a switch to hi heat. moves around the sleep tubes... a noise to her left. she whirls pulls the trigger on the flame thrower click. nothing. she tries again a half hearted burp, but no flame. she begins to panic senses the alien's presence. looks left, right, up no alien... looks down: the alien's tail is coming up between her legs. she turns right into it's grasp. the useless flamethrower skitters across the floor. she pummels the beast with balled up fists.}

<D>__{no. no! i beat you! i beat you mother fucker!!}
<A>__{the alien spins her pushes her over across the sleep tube like it's taking her from behind! ripley looks down into the sleep tube: newt is gone. her doll's head lays in a pool of blood. the alien wraps his arms around ripley. thin lips pull back for a kiss. she screams.}
