<A>__{claude is shoved into the back of the van and the doors are slammed behind him. he bangs and shouts, but it's no use.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{save your energy, claude. you're gonna need it.}
<A>__{ray is stretched out against the back wall. claude is knocked to the floor as the van lurches into motion.}
