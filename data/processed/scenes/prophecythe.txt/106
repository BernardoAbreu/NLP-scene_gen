<A>__{gabriel splashing the soot off his face and arms in a small, institutional bathroom. he looks at himself in the mirror, runs a hand through his hair, and walks out the door into}
<B>__{a hospital corridor}
<A>__{at the end of it is the intensive care unit, that institutional purgatory where a small handful of patients, wired and tubed and oxygenated, lay inconclusively between life and death. there's a nurse's station there, all health status video screens and a single nurse that looks up from her work at gabriel.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{can i help you?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{someone's going to die here soon. i will just be a minute.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{there's no visitors allowed in icu.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{the timing's important. i can smell these things, you know.}
<A>__{the nurse reaches for the telephone. gabriel takes it away from her with one hand and with the other grasps her face open palmed and whispers,}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{go to sleep.}
<A>__{the nurse slides out of her chair and collapses to the floor. gabriel pulls out the metal clipboards holding each patient's chart and flips through them, tossing one after another aside as unsuitable.}

<A>__{satisfied, he steps over to one of the beds, pulls back the curtain and sits down beside an unconscious, middle aged woman. he watches patiently, listening the beeping scrawl of the ekg above her. it was weak to begin with but now it's faltering badly, becoming the unsynched etchings of a child. a beeping alarm has begun to ring and her breathing is slowing to nothing. at the last possible moment gabriel places his fingers across her face, whispering to her, coaxing her.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{whoa, not just yet. come on back. that's it...}
<A>__{the ekg's still flat but the woman is breathing. she begins to choke, to cough, then suddenly sits up and opens her eyes. she looks in disbelief around her, finally settling on gabriel's grin.}

<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{a look of utter desolation and sadness sweeps over her as she begins to cry.}
