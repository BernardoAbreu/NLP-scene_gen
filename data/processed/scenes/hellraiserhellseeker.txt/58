<A>__{police tape flaps between the trees. other than that there is no sign of an investigation. trevor walks out of the woods on the shore, through the police tape and to the water's edge. he begins to walk the shore looking out at the still water. he scans the area where the water meets the land, trying to remember. something on the surface few feet away catches his eye. it's a rock sticking up. no it's something else. trevor walks right up to the water and puts his feet on a couple of large rocks breaking the surface. he bends down and looks at... the corner of a black cube. he quickly reaches down, tries to pick it up. it seems to be stuck just below the surface. trevor pulls harder and finally it gives. trevor slowly lifts the black cube out of the water and gasps when he sees a white waterlogged hand clutching it from below! trevor gasps and lets go. and just as the cube (along with its owner) splash under the surface another white hand breaks the surface grabbing trevor's wrist! as trevor struggles he looks up to see the dark figure standing above him holding a rock over his head. just as he swings down towards trevors head }
