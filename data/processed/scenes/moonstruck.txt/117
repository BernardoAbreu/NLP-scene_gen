<L>__{exterior street day loretta is walking}
<A>__{along a sidewalk a couple of blocks away. she is a wreck. she's still in her clothes of the night before. she hasn't slept. her hair's a bit funny. and she's tormented by the complications in her life. and, at the same time, she looks great. she looks like she's been loved up and down. she has a hickey on her neck. her eyes are dreamy and her walk is slow, utterly careless, and sexual. she's carrying, crunched in her hand, her program from la boheme. she starts singing. we follow her as she sings and walks.}
<B>__{we watch loretta walking from the back now}
<A>__{she's still muttering. she comes to a tin can. she kicks lt. she comes to it again. she kicks it again.}
