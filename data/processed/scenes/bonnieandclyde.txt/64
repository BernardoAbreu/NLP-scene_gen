<L>__{interior cheap motel bathroom. close up bonnie. day.}
<A>__{on the right of the screen, f.g., bonnie stands at the sink fixing her make up in the mirror. the make up has become more conservative. on the left, further back, is a bathtub and in it sits c.w. his head and knees peek over the gray, soapy water. he is engaged with his usual single minded concentration, in washing himself, carefully scrubbing his arms, not a thought in his head. bonnie finishes her make up and regards herself quizzically, tilting her head to look at herself at different angles. she is smoking a cigarette, and really, studying herself.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{what do you think of me, c.w.?}
<C>__{c.w.}
<D>__{uh...well, you're just fine, i guess. uh, well, course you're a real good shot...and...uh...well, sometimes you look pretty as a painting.}
<A>__{camera stays with bonnie during all this, watching her look at herself as she listens to c.w.'s evaluation. she has a narcissistic concern at the moment and as she hears him enumerate her values, she thinks about each in turn and decides yes, that's true.}
<C>__{c.w.}
<D>__{hey, uh, bonnie...could you get me that washrag there?}
<A>__{responding automatically, bonnie turns and walks to a towel rack, pulls the washcloth off and starts toward c.w. when suddenly she stops with a smile on her face and a sudden motion. teasingly, she holds the washcloth out at arm's length.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(coyly)}
<D>__{why'nt you come get it?}
<C>__{c.w.}
<P>__{(not even realizing what's on her mind)}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(wiggling the}
<D>__{washcloth like a}
<P>__{bull fighter's cape)}
<D>__{whyn't you come get it, c.w.?}
<A>__{suddenly c.w. looks mortally embarrassed as he realizes what that would entail.}
<C>__{c.w.}
<D>__{aw, bonnie, come on, gimme it.}
<A>__{bonnie tries another tack. she begins sauntering over slowly, teasingly, still holding out the treasured washcloth.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(pertly)}
<D>__{all right, i will bring it myself.}
<A>__{as she moves closer to the tub, c.w. realizes that she will be able to peer down into the tub and see him and he frantically reaches up with one hand and yanks the washcloth into the tub, causing a great splash. bonnie, somewhat the victim of the splash, jumps back and away. recovering her composure, she looks at c.w. who is slunk down in the tub like a gross september morn. she has tried him and he has failed; she realizes now that he was no choice for her; no real man, even if he might perform sexually. he is a lump. this irritates her; his very presence is demeaning to herself and clyde.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(irritated with}
<D>__{herself for even}
<P>__{thinking of such a thing)}
<D>__{you simpleton, what would you do if we just pulled out some night while you was asleep?}
<C>__{c.w.}
<P>__{(trying to give the}
<D>__{right answer, but}
<P>__{obviously faking it)}
<D>__{oh, i wouldn't know what to do. but you wouldn't do that. you couldn't now.}
<A>__{bonnie realizes, with some weariness, the inevitable truth of what he's said; thus resigned, she says patronizingly:}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{that's right, c.w. we'll always be around to take care of you.}
<A>__{pointedly, she throws her cigarette in his bath water, "sssssssssss." she turns and leaves the bathroom, slamming the door behind her.}
