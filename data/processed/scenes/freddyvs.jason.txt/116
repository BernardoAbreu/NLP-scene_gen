<A>__{the other kids dance around jason, taunting him... laughing at him... pointing and teasing... jason breaks away, running towards the pier. jason sits at the end of the pier, looking at his own reflection. he removes the mask and watches as the distortions in the water make his face look normal. someone comes up behind jason slowly. jason isn't aware of their presence until a shadowy reflection appears behind his own. jason turns to see who when he is suddenly pushed into the lake. jason splashes to the surface, sputtering, trying to stay afloat. a hand pushes his head back under the water. jason's underwater p.o.v. a distorted image of whoever is holding him under. jason thrusts out his arms, fighting to get back to the surface... fighting just to see who is killing him before he dies.}
