<L>__{exterior american camp night}
<A>__{the american camp is under siege. two dozen mumia riders gallop through. firing rifles. several diggers are killed as they run. the americans leap out of their tents firing. kill multiple riders. daniels is shot, spins and falls, keeps shooting. henderson and burns run to his aid, blasting away. o'connell races through the ruins and slams right into beni, who is obviously trying to high tail it out of there.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{goin' somewhere?}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{just looking for you, o'connell! i wanted to be with my friend!}
<A>__{o'connell drags him back towards the american camp.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{c'mon, friend.}
<C>__{beni}
<P>__{(struggling)}
<D>__{why do you like to fight so much?}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{'cause i look good doin, it.}
<A>__{ardeth ray gallops through the camp, cutting diggers down with his scimitar. o'connell runs up on top of some rocks, leaps out and tackles him off his horse. the two men slam to the ground. o'connell spins up onto one knee and fires, point blank. blows the scimitar out of ardeth ray's hand. o'connell is about to shoot again when a horse rides up between them. a scimitar swoops down, almost takes o'connell's head off, misses him by an inch. o'connell leaps up and blows the rider off his mount. the horse bolts. but ardeth ray is gone. evelyn hides behind some rocks, watching the scene, suddenly, she hears something coming up behind her and spins around. a vicious tattooed mumia rider races at her. evelyn quickly backpedals over the rocks, terrified. the mumia rider raises his scimitar, about to strike. evelyn screams, trips over a rock and fires the elephant gun, blam! blows the rider off his mount and catapults him twenty feet back into some ruins. at the same time, the kick blows evelyn off her feet and over a ridge. she flails through the air and lands in a sand dune. jonathan and some diggers are holding their own near the temple door. four riders come charging right at them. jonathan takes a swig off the seagrams.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{let 'em have it, boys!}
<A>__{jonathan and the diggers open fire. when the smoke clears, the riders are either dead or gone. jonathan grins.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{i say, bloody good show.}
<A>__{and then several more mumia leap off the temple and land behind them. jonathan and the remaining diggers spin around and suddenly find themselves in hand to hand combat. o'connell is quickly loading his pistol. he hears something thundering up behind him. he spins around just as ardeth ray on a horse swings his scimitar. o'connell instinctively raises his hands to protect his face, the scimitar strikes! hits his gun, ching! o'connell's gun flips away. disarmed, o'connell dives and rolls and suddenly comes up with a stick of dynamite in his hand. he shoves the fuse into a fire. it ignites. he faces ardeth ray, towering above him. the two men lock eyes. the fuse continues to burn down. ardeth ray points his scimitar at o'connell's head.}
<C>__{ardeth ray}
<D>__{leave this place!... leave this place or die!}
<A>__{ardeth ray gallops off. the remaining mumia riders race after him, vanishing into the night. o'connell watches them leave, then turns to the burning fuse,... and blows it out. evelyn staggers up, looking very shaken. o'connell gently takes her and holds her close.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{you alright?}
<A>__{evelyn looks up into his strong eyes. it's the first time he's shown genuine concern for her. and she likes it. he's also holding her a little too close. and she likes that too.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{yes,... fine,... thank you.}
<A>__{beni crawls out from under some pillars as henderson and burns help daniels to his feet.}
<C>__{daniels}
<D>__{see! that proves it! old seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand!}
<C>__{henderson}
<D>__{for them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there.}
<A>__{o'connell looks up into the surrounding ridges, unsatisfied.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{these men are a desert people. they value water, not gold.}
<A>__{evelyn looks at o'connell, suddenly very worried.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{where's jonathan?}
