<L>__{exterior glendale train station night}
<A>__{daphne sits in the car, her eyes staring straight ahead, still in shock.}
<L>__{exterior platform night}
<A>__{a few people hurry to board the train, easy and mouse among them.}
<C>__{easy }
<D>__{i convinced mouse to take the two o'clock train to pomona and to let me handle everything else. he could get a train back to houston later that morning... he was fine with that but only because he was seven thousand dollars richer. daphne had gotten the money out of a locker at the ymca without a word... easy (v.o.) (cont'd) because she was still in shock and couldn't really talk... maybe too because she had stolen about four times that much from carter.}
<C>__{mouse}
<D>__{listen, if you think you gonna have trouble with that dude frank, i can run by and kill him and take that evening train to houston.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{naw, man.}
<A>__{he has had enough of mouse for a while.}
<C>__{mouse}
<D>__{oh. this is for you.}
<A>__{and he pulls out something wrapped up in a brown paper bag from his coat.}
<C>__{mouse}
<D>__{i cut you in for half 'cause i knew you was too big a fool to take your share from that white girl yourself.}
<A>__{easy stares numbly at the package and then takes it. the conductor gets on board and the train starts making those metal on metal sounds.}
<C>__{mouse}
<D>__{send my grip to etta mae. i'm gonna see if she'll take me back now that i'm flush.}
<A>__{he slaps easy on the shoulder and boards the train.}
<C>__{mouse}
<D>__{oh, here's the keys to dupree's car.}
<A>__{he tosses them, and the train starts moving.}
<C>__{mouse}
<D>__{and if you need somebody to run them streets with ya, gimme a call. you know how to put some money in a nigga's pocket.}
<A>__{and he laughs, flashing gold teeth pulling away. easy watches.}
<C>__{easy }
<D>__{i knew i would see him again and i didn't know how i felt about that... 'cause, unlike mouse, my legs were like rubber... the way they had been in the war the whole two years i was there.}
