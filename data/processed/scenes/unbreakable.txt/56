<L>__{interior limited edition late afternoon}
<A>__{david and jeremy enter the store. elijah leans on a walking stick before one of the framed sketches. he gazes at it quietly.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i think you skipped a couple steps.}
<A>__{elijah turns.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you forgot the "now i'm going to tell you what the hell is going on" step. see usually that comes before the, "it's over" step. and it always, always comes before the "you can go" step.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what is over?}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{the life of an idea that has lived too long in my head.}
<A>__{david stares at elijah impatiently.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{there are probably only four or five individuals in the world who can claim more knowledge of comics than myself. i've spent a third of my life in a hospital bed with nothing else to do but read. i have studied the form intimately. i have seen the patterns in them... the references to social and cultural events and the atmosphere that surrounded them. i've come to believe that comics are our last link to the ancient way of passing on history.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{the egyptians drew pictures on walls about battles, and events. countries all around the world still pass on knowledge through pictorial forms.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i believe that comics, just at their core now... have a truth. they are depicting what someone, somewhere felt or experienced. then of course that core got chewed up in the commercial machine and gets jazzed up, made titillating cartooned for the sale rack.}
<A>__{elijah gazes at david.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{this city has had its share of disasters. well publicized ones. it was around the time of that plane crash, when it first entered my head. and there it stayed, as i waited and watched the news over the years...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and then one day i see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed.}
<P>__{(soft)}
<D>__{and just like that, an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what was your idea elijah?}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{if there is someone like me in the world, and i'm at one end of the spectrum... couldn't there be someone the opposite of me, at the other end?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{a person who can't be hurt like the rest of us. a kind of person they were talking about in those stories.}
<A>__{elijah points at the framed comic sketches.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{a person they believed was put here to protect the rest of us. guard us.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{you thought my dad was a real }
<C>__{david}
<D>__{jeremy don't take another sip of that drink.}
<A>__{jeremy looks down at the paper cup in his hands.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{throw it in the trashcan near the door and wait for me outside. do it now please.}
<A>__{david waits for jeremy to exit the store. beat.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{at the church... you were following me weren't you?}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{technically no. i gambled that you would attend the church service. i just waited for you.}
<A>__{david glares at elijah.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what's this about? this is obviously some scam. is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{you've misunderstood.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i see guys like you all the time in my work. you find someone you think is emotionally vulnerable and you tell them a fantastic story, utterly convincing... and somewhere in there, you slip it in... 'i just need your credit card number','i just need a small down payment.'}
<A>__{david shakes his head. he smiles out of frustration. beat.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{did you know that this morning was the first morning i can remember, that i didn't open my eyes and feel that sadness... do you know what i'm talking about? that little bit of sadness?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i thought the person that wrote that note had an answer for me. for why i survived that train. for why my life feels so out of balance...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but i guess that's what you were counting on.}
<A>__{elijah stares carefully at david. beat. david glances over to the entrance. jeremy watched through the window concerned.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i'm going to leave now.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{good luck with your sale.}
<A>__{elijah watches david walk towards the front door.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{what type of job do you have david?}
<A>__{david opens the door. he looks back at elijah.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{you mentioned you've met 'guys like me' in your work.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what type of job would that be?}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i work at the stadium as a security guard.}
<A>__{beat. david closes the door behind him. elijah watches through the window as jeremy takes david's hand as they cross the street. elijah gazes out the window in a bit of a daze.}
