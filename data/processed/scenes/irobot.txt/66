<L>__{interior police h.q. corridor day}
<A>__{close on sonny being escorted down a corridor by toller, bergin and a number of heavily armed officers. he's bound with high tech shackles.}
<L>__{interior underground car park day}
<A>__{sonny and his police entourage emerge from the elevator into an underground car park. spooner. waiting for them. heads over. toller. holds out his hand.}
<C>__{toller}
<D>__{case is closed, spooner.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{apparently...}
<A>__{he pushes past him. falling into step beside sonny.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{i didn't expect to see you again, detective...}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{i need you to help me clear something up.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{i will do my best.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{a scientist builds a robot that acts like a man. more like a man than any robot ever before. it shoots him and u.s. robotics calls it a failure.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{what would you call it?}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{a stunning success.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you were there, robot. what am i missing?}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{don't start simulating ignorance.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{i'm not simulating ignorance, detective. i'm experiencing it. i was asleep.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{you mean you were shut down.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{no, i was asleep.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{robots don't sleep. human beings sleep. understand? dogs sleep. you're a machine. an imitation. an illusion of life. can a robot write a symphony? can a robot take a blank canvas and paint a masterpiece?}
<A>__{a pause. then the muted whir as sonny turns to him.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{can you do either of those things?}
<A>__{spooner. momentarily stumped. as a van from u.s. robotics pulls up. the back door dropping open. an engineer motions to the robot.}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{step forward. enter.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{they're going to destroy me, aren't they?}
<A>__{spooner. watching him step into the van.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{sonny sits down. with an almost human melancholy. the engineers, securing him in place.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{the doctor was right. he told me everything was going to change....}
<A>__{the engineers start to close the doors. but spooner reaches out to stop them. sonny. looks over at him.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{it's changing already...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{can't you feel it?}
<A>__{as clang! the van door closes. spooner, stepping back. something. just not right. lieutenant bergin comes up beside him.}
<C>__{lt. bergin}
<D>__{you should be happy. that's one less robot in the world.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{they're going to destroy the most advanced robot in the world, john. that doesn't strike you as odd?}
<C>__{lt. bergin}
<D>__{killer robots are bad for business. even your friend dr. calvin said so.}
<P>__{(slaps him on the back)}
<D>__{come on. you solved the case. give yourself a break.}
<A>__{spooner looks at him. there's no way he's giving himself a break.}
