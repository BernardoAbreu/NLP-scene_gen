<A>__{doug and alex are waiting to pick up hands.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{did you get hands that car?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i got him one like it.}
<A>__{doug is in shock.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{what do you mean one like it?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i got him the volante.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{what did i say? what exactly did i say?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you said get him the vantage.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{that's right, i clearly said get him the vantage. so why did you get the volante? ;}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{because they look the same.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{the septuagint scholars mistranslated the hebrew word for "young woman" in to the greek word for "virgin", because they thought they looked the same, coming up with the prophecy behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son". but there is a world of difference between a virgin and a young woman like there is between a volante and a fuckin vantage.}
<A>__{pause: she thinks about this.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{are you saying that the fact that your cousin hands is driving a valiant instead of a vantage is a profound a mistake as a whole religion?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{yes i fuckin am!}
<C>__{doug }
<D>__{cars are his religion. he can drive a valiant in the states but i can't drive a vantage because they won't tolerate the emissions. well, it's too late now, that's concorde.}
<A>__{shot of concorde's wheels touching down}
