<D>__{oh, i'm much too excited.}

<D>__{it's from a museum catalogue. but it's not real. it's a copy.}
<C>__{wavey }
<D>__{it is my favorite teapot.}

<D>__{it's nice for your eyes. i thought.}

<D>__{i don't make mistakes. about that kind of thing.}

<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{it was so big, i thought it was a tea cozy for your car. but if it's for me, it has to be bigger, huh?}

<A>__{and from his prison of shock and shame. he points to a shelf. she is off his desk, like a panther... ...snatches the tiny padded box with its treasure. raises it high to smash it, and... ...stops. to see the panic. in his eyes. it brings tears. pooling in hers. and she sets the treasure down, with the tenderness that decency requires.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{can you guess how i know about petal?}
<A>__{he cannot.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{because you and i. are kindred souls. after all.}

<C>__{wavey}

<A>__{angle...dennis and his wife beety bundled together asleep, as a ferocious storm howls around the house. angle...quoyle awake on the sofa in dennis' parlor. clutching his blankets around him. eyes jumping with every shriek of the marauding wind. mind racing with thoughts of wavey. and eggshells. angle...bunny asleep with dennis' daughter marty. the room seems to vibrate under the violence of the weather's assault. close on bunny now, and... ...her eyes open. a strange intent in them. a knowledge. she slips from marty's bed in her thin blue nightdress. through the house in the dark, as the wind screams its warning. into the par lor where her father sleeps, as the wind suddenly invades, and... ...sucks her straight up the chimney and out into the heart of the storm. sailing like a loosened kite out across the black water. out and out, as gray light rises, to... ...quoyle point, where she is blown flat against a granite boulder just in front of the green house, which shivers and pleads against the wind, its steel cables straining, and suddenly from within the house, lights come on... ...the white dog is in a window. no longer snarling and menacing, but whining pitifully, begging to be saved. and on the second floor... ...petal alone, wild eyed with terror. she is dressed all in blue, and her daisy chain necklace flies about her throat as she pounds against the glass, her eyes staring directly at her daughter, who can only scream soundlessly against the gale as the house... ...begins to come loose, the first cable snapping and whipping about with the fierce destructiveness of unleashed power, then the next, and another, and with petal still visible, howling in horror, windows bursting everywhere else like flash bulbs, the house... ...slides free, along the rocks, toward the cliff, bunny screeching as it goes over the edge, tumbles down toward the sea, and bunny... ...sits bolt upright in bed, a single gasp as her dad is there, holding her tight. she is soaked with sweat. but her eyes are not wild. they are filled with the knowing.}
<C>__{bunny }
<D>__{daddy. the green house is gone.}
<A>__{he smooths her hair. the wind bellows in rage. little marty somehow sleeps on, undisturbed, beside her.}

<L>__{exterior quoyle point day}
<A>__{they climb from the station wagon into cold, clear sunlight. stare in wonder at the naked rock. the snapped, spent, cables. only shards of wood and glass leaving a hapless trail toward the cliff. bunny runs toward the debris, and through it. to a tangle of bushes near the cliff. he walks to a broken cable. crouches. his eyes running over the space. where his ancestor's home once stood. and then. he turns...}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{what you got there?}
<A>__{we see now. bunny has unearthed a huge wooden crate from its hiding place. too engrossed in counting its contents to respond. as he comes over...}
<C>__{bunny }
<D>__{petal's things.}
<A>__{she is counting her treasure trove of necklaces. more than any sound mind could imagine. yet, in their infinite variety, somehow wonderful. a testimonial to the power of love.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{i think they're all here.}
<A>__{she looks up. sees him staring so fixedly at them.}

<L>__{exterior jack buggit's skiff morning}
<A>__{steel gray morning. the sea is more than a little rough, as jack lays out his lobster traps. two other boats, not too close by, appear and disappear in mist. he is checking the lines, knotting hefty weights onto the traps to take them down.}

<D>__{oh, th' gandy goose she ain't no uuuuse cos all her nuts'n bolts is...}

<D>__{what is this? suicide attempt?}
<A>__{tries to let go of the trap and grab the cat in one motion, but the cat jumps back to the boat, jack stumbling out of his way, steps in the coiled line which whirrs as the trap goes... ...down, the line strangling jack's leg and whipping him flailing over the side in one startling heartbeat. almost comic to watch. but then. it is very quiet. air bubbles appear at the surface. in a few seconds... the water is unbroken. the boat bobs silently in the swells.}
<L>__{interior alvin yark's boat house day}
<A>__{quoyle and alvin inspect quoyle's newly finished boat. it is a beauty, to be sure, and the old builder watches quoyle lovingly running his hand across the smooth gunnel. alvin doesn't smile. that's not his style.}

<D>__{gotta paint the name. what'll it be? 'the tall and quiet woman'?}

<C>__{alvin}
<D>__{the maid in the meadow, that's her innocence and play. the stouthearted woman, is when you need to lean on her.}

<C>__{alvin}
<D>__{the tall and quiet woman? that's the silent partner who always walks 'longside, so's yer never alone.}

<D>__{and the demon lover. that's just the frostin' on th' cake.}

<C>__{alvin}

<D>__{...like m'gertie.}
<A>__{but she isn't alone. a man enters behind her. it is dennis buggit. and there are tears on his face. he brings a dreadful silence with him, because the face is an open grave.}

<A>__{every room is filled with folks who wear their best. there is eating and chatter and even some pockets of laughter, as we move through the crowd. as if some have taken hold of a wake's well meaning purpose. others stand dazed, still wearing their pain and confusion. there are children here, some hold a parent's hand, some giggle with each other. snapshot of a community. struggling to cope. quoyle and bunny enter, holding hands, looking around. as they cross the room... ...two figures step into their path. two women holding hands, their bodies close together. their feeling for each other open for all to see. one is agnis. and the other. isn't mavis bangs.}
<C>__{dawn}
<D>__{happy new year, mr. quoyle. i'm sorry i missed you at the pageant.}
<A>__{slightly startled, quoyle can't help but smile, despite the solemn occasion. at the proud look on his aunt's face.}
<C>__{dawn}
<D>__{i was in the wings, a course. wasn't our girl somethin'?}
<A>__{our girl, a course, is agnis. who nearly blushes at the compliment.}
<C>__{dawn}
<D>__{i say, y'have t'love a woman. who's in touch with her inner chicken.}

<D>__{nephew. you okay?}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{he's okay. he's not sleeping in the box.}
<A>__{her great aunt looks at this child. bends to plant an unexpected kiss on the top of bunny's head. the kid squirms, tugs her dad firmly off, as he sends a parting wave. into the parlor now. quieter here, as the new arrivals thread past jack buggit in his open coffin, resting on black draped sawhorses. dennis and his mom stand by jack, a hand and a word for each. and moving into the line...}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{remember what i told you.}
<A>__{his words a murmur. hers are bolder...}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{if he's not sleeping. why do they call it a awake?}
<A>__{he thinks. as if it is a worthwhile question.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{we're the ones have to be awake. to how much we love him...}
<A>__{nods to himself. yes.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{and how we should be good to each other. while we have the chance.}
<A>__{he looks down. they are almost there.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{you think?}
<A>__{she is thinking. keeping the thoughts to herself. at the coffin now, he lifts her up to see. jack lies motionless, a wax figure of himself. serene behind violet eyelids.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{he looks like he's sleeping.}
<A>__{dennis looks over. his stolid, grim face releases a smile for his friend.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{that's cos he's peaceful. no worries, anymore. no troubles.}
<A>__{he sets her down. clasps mrs. buggit's hand. and from his pocket...}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{i found this in jack's drawer at the paper. i don't know if it's somethin' special...}
<A>__{an enameled wreath with the initial r, backed by a long, sharp pin she tears up again, just to see it.}
<C>__{mrs. buggit}
<D>__{oh, it's his lodge pin. we were lookin' all over.}
<A>__{she smiles bravely as she takes it. leans up to kiss his cheek.}
<C>__{mrs. buggit }
<D>__{dennis showed me what y'wrote fer th' paper. did jack proud.}
<A>__{so they look at each other. dennis clears his throat, looks away. and then, quoyle is leading bunny off.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{you hungry? there's sandwi...}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{petal's peaceful, too.}
<A>__{just a statement of fact. to no one in particular. dad squeezes her hand. manages...}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{you bet. you can count on tha...}
<A>__{but she lets go. scampers to a corner of the room. to herry prowse. and his mom. so quoyle starts toward her, his heart in his throat. and when wavey looks up. she is glad to see him. as he reaches her... she holds up her wrist. dangling from it, her turquoise bracelet she wore her best for jack. quoyle stands very close. one last thing from his pocket...}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{new year's present.}
<A>__{a small box. wrapped as careful as he could. she looks to his eyes, really?}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{oh, yeh. it's a quoyle tradition.}
<A>__{well, in that case. she takes it into her slender fingers. undoes the ribbon, the paper. lifts the lid to see, resting in tissue... ...eggshells. crushed almost to powder. her heart comes straight to her eyes, even before the whispered...}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{thanks. for the mirror.}
<A>__{and across the room, mrs. buggit leans with trembling hands to fix the lodge pin to jack's lapel. shaking as she is, the hand lurches, the big pin goes plunging, and... ...a rattling cough. rolls across this room. the world falls silent. jack's wife grabs her son's arm, and their eyes bug out, staring into the box.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{dad's come back!}
<A>__{and lunges to help hs gurgling father free his shoulders from the coffin's wedge. a sudden roar, there are screams, there is even laughter and whistling, complete chaos. and in the bedlam, a tug on quoyle's coat...}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{see. he woke up.}
<L>__{exterior omaloor bay day}
<A>__{sunlit day of crystal perfection. the majesty of ice and towering rock and shimmering water. a scale so majestic, any cynic would be hard put to deny god's hand. and gliding into frame... ...a tiny skiff. on its maiden run. we close to see... ...painted on its side. the four women. one woman is rowing just now, doing all the work. her son sleeps in the bow. and in the middle of the little boat... ...father and daughter. are unpacking the picnic lunch. there is a lot of food. this could take awhile.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{that's a funny thing to say. for the first thing he said.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{what? 'i'm keepin' m'damn lobster license'?}
<A>__{yeh. that.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{maybe he just said it. to make your uncle dennis laugh so hard. you think?}
<A>__{she keeps unpacking. her face quiet and serious. her thoughts her own.}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{it's not fair, is it. that jack woke up. and petal didn't.}
<A>__{and since he's said her thought aloud. she tells him...}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{well. the world's not fair. you said.}
<A>__{she's not looking up. but he knows she's listening.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{that's something the world is always teaching us. and sometimes, the learning comes later.}
<A>__{that gets through. both adults can see it.}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{you taught me that.}
<A>__{eyes resolutely down, she nods. remembers.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{you know. what we wait for? it's like the main stem of this boat. it gives us our shape.}
<A>__{her brow furrows. doesn't understand that.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{see, i know why you saved a place for petal. all this time.}
<A>__{on this. she looks up. her dad is smiling from his eyes.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{cos i'm the daddy. and you learn how to do. by watching me.}
<A>__{and...}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{you just watched. better than i knew.}
<A>__{still holding bunny's eyes. he beckons to the woman rowing. c'mere, a second. so wavey sets down her oars. slides over. and quoyle whispers to his daughter...}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{watch this.}
<A>__{he leans his face. to wavey's mouth. a kiss so tender, even a child can't turn away. the moment lingers. and when it ends...}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{i'm thanking your daddy. for all my presents.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{there was only two.}
<A>__{wavey looks at this girl.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{more than two. everything i need. except...}
<A>__{except. she gathers all the courage it takes to say...}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{except a necklace.}
<A>__{and waits. we can feel her heart pounding in her throat. bunny stares back with eyes no one could read. and then...}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{i got a box of 'em. you could pick one.}
<A>__{a hush over this bay. a woman stunned and grateful.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{then you'd have everything you need.}
<A>__{well, that seems true. so, the woman nods. her eyes flutter down. in the silence, she unwraps a sandwich...}
<C>__{wavey }
<D>__{you want the cheese?}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{okay, then. she hands that one to quoyle. and as she and bunny look for another, we pull... ...up and away, an aerial angle swirling above the shimmering bay. the boat so far below us. the people tiny specks. they could be anyone. anyone at all.}
