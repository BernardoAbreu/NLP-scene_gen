<L>__{interior family room midnight}
<A>__{the family room lights are off now. the tv is still on. the sound is muted. there are a couple glasses of bo's water on the television now. the fourteen lights are still hovering on the screen. morgan is asleep on graham's lap. bo is asleep on merrill's shoulder.}
<C>__{merrill}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{some people are probably thinking this is the end of the world.}
<A>__{graham turns his sleepy eyes away from the screen to merrill.}

<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{do you think it's a possibility?}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{merrill}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{how can you say that?}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{that wasn't the answer you wanted?}
<C>__{merrill}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{can you at least pretend to be like you used to be? give me some comfort?}
<A>__{beat. graham thinks it over.}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{... there are all different ways you can tell that there's someone really there watching out for us. you see signs. sometimes they're little ones. you think of someone. the phone rings. they're on the phone... sometimes they're big, like fourteen lights hovering over mexico city.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{sure, there are a lot of people watching this who think this could be a bad thing. but there are a lot of people watching this, who think it's a miracle. a sign of god's existence. it's all in how you look at things merrill.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what you have to decide is what kind of person you are? are you the type who believes in miracles and looks for signs or are you the kind who believes, things just happen by chance?}
<A>__{beat. merrill is deep in thought.}
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{i was at this party once. i'm on a couch with sara mckinney. she was just sitting there, looking beautiful and staring at me. i go to lean in and kiss her and i realize i have gum in my mouth. i turn and take out the gum. stuff it in my paper cup next to the sofa and turn around. sara mckinney throws up all over herself.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i knew the second it happened. it was a miracle. i could have been kissing her when she threw up. that would have scarred me for life. i may never have recovered.}
<A>__{merrill looks at the tv screen. beat.}
<C>__{merrill}
<D>__{i'm a miracle man. those lights are a miracle.}
<A>__{graham smiles.}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{there you go.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{merrill}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{so which type are you?}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{do you feel comforted?}
<C>__{merrill}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{what does it matter then?}
<A>__{the two of them turn back to the silent screen of the television. it's a long beat before graham speaks.}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{do you know what colleen's last words were before they killed her?}
<A>__{beat. merrill turns and stares quietly at his brother.}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{she said, "see", and then her eyes glazed a bit and she said... "tell merrill to swing away."}
<A>__{merrill's mouth opens a bit. graham turns and chuckles at his expression.}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{do you know why she said that?}
<A>__{merrill nods, "no."}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{because the nerve endings in her brain were firing as she died, and some random memory of us at one of your baseball games popped into her head.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{there is no one watching out for us merrill. we're all on our own.}
<A>__{graham turns back to the television. beat.}
<B>__{the light of the television flickers on the faces of the two brothers as they sit watching in silence.}
