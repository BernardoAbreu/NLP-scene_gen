<L>__{int mansion corridor morning}
<A>__{though it's still morning, the windows are sealed over. no sunshine can enter. from this point on... there will be no indication of time... except as shown on clocks. a sense of dread takes hold of us as... ...dark shadows lurch...feet scrape sluggishly... not in combat boots, but in nikes, loafers, dr. martens... past an accordion gate of corroded bronze. a motor hums. behind the gate, an old fashioned service elevator rises... but stops just below floor level. eyes peer out, waiting for the shuffling feet to pass. then the car rises the rest of the way, revealing its occupant... ...jill valentine! she's alive! she deactivates the elevator by pulling her blue access card out of an incon gruously modern receptacle. checking to be sure that the coast is clear, she slides the accordion gate aside and steps out into the corridor. with a ghostly moan, something lunges at her out of the shadows. it's a man in a lab coat. his skin is rotting, his teeth snapping, like the dogs'. he tries to bite jill, not merely to do injury. he seems hungry! jill leaps aside, lifting her pistol and firing... once, twice, three times. the man is shot in the stomach, heart, neck...but he keeps coming! finally, jill shoots him in the head...and he falls. jill quickly reloads, on instinct. but as she does it, she stares at the corpse, frowning, weighing life long belief against the hideous facts of the moment.}
