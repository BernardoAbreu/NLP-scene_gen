<D>__{all right. the gold card.}
<P>__{(tossing the credit card in eddie's face)}
<D>__{don't leave home without it.}
<A>__{a chill wind whips across the roof as nick extracts the cash and begins to count it. there's a distant, indistinct clang: metal on metal. eddie hears it and tenses up.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{let's beat it, man. i don't like being up here.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what, scared of heights?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i dunno, man. after what happened to johnny gobs }
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{look, johnny gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right? no big loss.}

<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{five stories, straight down. there was no blood in the body.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{no shit. it was all over the pavement.}
<A>__{nick has no patience with campfire tales but here on the roof, in the pale moonlight, he can't ignore the slight tingle at the base of his spine...}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{there was no blood, man.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{my brother says... all the bad things you done... they come back and haunt you...}
<C>__{nick}

<C>__{nick}
<D>__{no wonder you're such a chickenshit. now shut up.}
<P>__{(conclusively)}
<D>__{there ain't no bat.}
<A>__{as they speak our attention shifts to a point at the opposite corner of the roof, some fifteen yards away... where, at the end of a line, a strange black silhouette is dropping slowly, implacably, into frame...}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{you shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man. you shouldn'ta }
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{do you want this money or don't you? now shut up! shut up }
<A>__{both punks freeze at the sudden, inexplicable sound of boots crunching on gravel. they turn slowly. their jaws}
<B>__{drop.}
<A>__{standing at the edge of the roof, bathed in moonlight, is a}
<B>__{black apparition. it does not move.}
<A>__{eddie stands rooted to the spot, a choked gurgle in his throat, as if he's just seen his own death. the black figure advances, spreading its arms. or rather, its wings: great black batwings, flapping in the wind. nick drops to the gravel, gropes for the gun, brings it up. and still the black figure draws closer, deliberate, menacing. on its chest: the emblem of a bat, in an oval yellow field, glowing like a target in the darkness... nick fires twice. two clean hits. the strange black figure is knocked bodily to the roof. trembling, sweating buckets, nick gets to his feet. he whacks a motionless eddie on the arm }
<C>__{nick }
<D>__{i'm gettin' outta here.}
<A>__{ and bends to retrieve his loot. eddie lets out a strange, pre verbal squeal... ... and nick sees the human bat, back on its feet, nightmarish, undead, moving slowly and inevitably closer. panic. sheer, raw, unrelenting panic. stolen money flutters out of nick's hands. he scuttles around the periphery of the roof, his feet skidding on the gravel as he searches for a way down. the black spectre is blocking his path to the fire escape. trapped like a rat, nick fires wildly. eddie is frozen in place, his eyes glazed over, his face drained of blood. the bat treads calmly past. a leg snakes out. a black boot catches eddie high on the chest lifts him cleanly off his feet and sends him flying through the air. eddie slams into a brick chimney and slumps to the roof unconscious, a broken, weightless puppet. this action is so smooth, so automatic, that the bat does not even break his stride. nick sees his chance and charges past the black wraith, scrambling toward the fire escape... a gloved hand slices through the air, and nick pitches forward, his legs ensnared in a tangle of wires. screaming now, he drags himself across the gravel roof, the looming figure of the bat at his heels... ... until there's no place left to go. nick cowers against the ledge, his pants torn, his hands and knees bloody. he has dissolved into total mindless hysteria. almost by reflex, nick keeps shooting. he'd do better if he could manage to open his eyes. by now the hammer is falling on an empty chamber, but nick continues, obsessively, to pull the trigger. he weeps; he moans; he wails... the bat grabs a fistful of nick's shirt, and with supernatural ease hoists him into the air.}
<C>__{nick }
<D>__{don't kill me... don't kill me...}
<A>__{when nick finally opens his eyes, he realizes the bat is standing on the ledge of the roof holding him out, at arm's length, over six stories of nothingness. the gruesome black apparition speaks, in a rasping whisper:}
<C>__{batman}
<D>__{i won't kill you. i want you to do me a favor.}
<A>__{nick looks down. far, far below, cars wink silently past. he looks up. and sees, in the mirrored lenses where batman's eyes should be, the twin reflections of his own stricken face.}
<C>__{batman }
<D>__{tell your friends. tell all your friends.}
<A>__{nick howls. almost as an afterthought, the batman heaves him roughly back onto the roof. and then casually, without a moment's hesitation steps off the ledge of the roof, into midair. trembling, nick crawls to the ledge and looks over... finding absolutely no trace of the batman. nick is still screaming as we pan up to the bilious yellow globe of gotham's moon. main credits roll:}
