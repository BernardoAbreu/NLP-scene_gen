<A>__{we pass through electrical shields into a 2,000 foot high control room filled with orange spice gas. on the floor are large gratings covering an exhaust and filtering system. tons of spice gas are being converted into the clouds of gas along a wall of machinery. from within a dark metal tunnel comes a guild navigator. he exits the tunnel and swims through the gas 1,000 feet to a six dimensional layered miniature replica of the entire universe. the navigator emits a long piece of light from his mouth which travels to one edge of the universe and changes into a likeness of the planet caladan. the navigator turns and emits another piece of light which travels to the opposite side of the universe. it changes into a likeness of arrakis. the navigator begins to put his slender fingers in amongst the stars and he emits sounds and bursts of light into the mass of stars and galaxies. the universe begins to vibrate and elongate, then to curve. electrical lightening traverses from caladan to arrakis as the universe bends into a u shape. arrakis submerges deep into the light. the navigator swims to the point where arrakis disappeared. he begins to pull and tear a hole in the universe. stars like sparks and sounds and rings of light appear, along with a roaring wind. the navigator swims deep into this hole through the rings of light. the navigator becomes more and more transparent, until he's lost in darkness. the sounds fade. }
