<L>__{exterior street}
<A>__{through the rain, we see: a patch of parochial school children, asian children, on the streetcorner. bobby's car peels off, away from danger. burt's car is headed right for them. in what seems like his dazed last gasp, he slams on the brakes. the car skids out, spins. the motion is dizzying... the olds is uncontrolled. the vehicle moves through a traffic light, hitting another car. starts tumbling, not on its side, but head over tail. it is one intense image. the car is upside down now. it slides for tens of feet before stopping. smoldering... the rain falls, making an oddly serene sound. we hear sirens. the police are approaching. burt's car stops slowly. he gets out of the car, his face a mess. he stumbles for a few feet in the rain. bobby's car arrives on the scene... burt's eyes are red, filling with blood. his jaw is open. he gasps for air, a vacant stare on his face. his body spasms. then he collapses, on his knees. falls. face down. in a pool of blood. the police are in the background... wide shot of the block as bobby moves to his father, who is lying on the street. bobby bends down, turning his father over. his father's blood is all over his hands now. burt is dead. other cops surround them. bobby looks up at all of them, they at him. broken, he pushes the others away. as water drips off his face:}

<A>__{bobby eyes his father, spent, crestfallen but not histrionic. the camera tilts down. the blood from burt's body flows into the street, along the curb,into the gutter.}
