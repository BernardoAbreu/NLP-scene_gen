<A>__{evelyn wakes up, lying chained to the top of the altar. she blinks, then turns her head, and looks right into the rotted face of anck su namun's corpse. evelyn screams.}
<L>__{interior labyrinth passageways day}
<A>__{the elephant gun fires, blasting flame and smoke right into the lens. o'connell, jonathan and ardeth ray race down a passageway, a dozen mummies striding after them.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{this whole place is comin, alive!}
<A>__{the men race around a corner. more mummies. they race around another corner. more mummies. onward they come. methodical. relentless. boxing in our heroes. o'connell and ardeth ray firing as they go. ardeth ray goes empty.}
<C>__{ardeth ray}
<D>__{i'm out.}
<A>__{he throws the machine gun down and they all race into horus' chamber day a small chamber. the lower half of the giant statue of horus stands in the middle of the chamber.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{there he is!}
<A>__{they run up to the base of the statue,}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{hello horus old boy.}
<A>__{o'connell looks back at the mummies coming down the passageway. he reaches into his gunny sack and pulls out a stick of dynamite. ardeth ray taps him on the shoulder.}
<C>__{ardeth ray}
<D>__{allow me.}
<A>__{o'connell hands him the dynamite and a match, then turns to look at the statue. ardeth ray reaches forward and strikes the match off o'connell's stubbly face. o'connell yelps. ardeth ray lights the dynamite and throws it down the passageway. they all hit the deck. the dynamite explodes. ripping apart the creatures, causing a cave in and sealing the passageway with rock and dirt. now there's only one way out, another dark, creepy passageway.}
