<D>__{...but then that got to be a pain in the ass. people called me on the phone all the fuckin time. i couldn't rent a fuckin tape without six phone calls interrupting me. "hey, freddy, when's the next time you're gettin some?" "motherfucker, i'm tryin to watch 'lost boys' when i have some, i will let you know." and then these rinky dink pot heads come by there's my friends and everything, but still. i got all my shit laid out in sixty dollar bags. well, they don't want sixty dollars worth. they want ten dollars worth. breaking it up is a major fuckin pain in the ass. i don't even know how much ten dollars worth is. "well, fuck, man, i don't want that much around. if i have that much around i will smoke it." "hey, if you guys can't control your smokin, that's not my problem. you motherfuckers been smokin for five years, be a adult about it." finally i just told my connection, count me out. but as it turns out, i'm the best guy she had, and she depended alot on my business. but i was still sick to death of it. and she's trying to talk me into not quitin. now this was a very weird situation, 'cause i don't know if you remember back in '86, there was a major fuckin drought. nobody and anything. people were livin on resin and smokin the wood in their pipes for months. and this chick had a bunch, and was beggin me to sell it. so i told her i wasn't gonna be joe the pot man anymore. but i would take a little bit and sell it to my close, close, close friends. she agreed to that, and said we'd keep the same arrangement as before, ten percent and free pot for me, as long as i helped her out that weekend. she had a brick of weed she was sellin, and she didn't want to go to the buy alone...}
