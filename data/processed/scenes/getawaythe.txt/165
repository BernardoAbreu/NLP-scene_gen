<A>__{rudy is spinning the chamber on his .44 then shoves it into his coat pocket. fran is getting dressed in the middle of the room, her breasts and thighs ripple outward from the confines of the bra and girdle. the calico kitten sleeps peacefully in its cardboard box.}

<A>__{carol is in the shower, steam hangs in the air as she vigorously soaps her body, cleansing herself of the residue left from their cross country flight. doc in the main room is standing at the large windows facing across to the building next to laughlins. the fire escape is one story beneath him. doc crosses, throws the suitcase on the bed, undoes the straps and snaps, lifts the lid open. he stares at the huge amount of money for a moment, then digs into the suitcase, reaching down to the bottom. he withdraws his hand, holding four visas.. he puts two of them on the bureau drawer top... the other two he begins to tear into sections and places them into a large ashtray. he touches a match to the scraps. the flames curl around rudy's photograph in the ashtray.}
