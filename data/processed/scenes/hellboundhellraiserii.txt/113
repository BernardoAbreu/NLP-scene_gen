<L>__{interior tiffany's room (2nd version) day}
<A>__{as we see clearly the room they have come into, we perhaps share the feeling that kirsty expressed in the corridor; something is wrong. the tiles that make up the floor are patterned as before but the individual tiles are larger. the room itself seems more spacious, the ceiling higher. there is a bowl of flowers by the window. the flowers were in full bloom before their trip to hell but now they seem long dead. the audience have to notice most of this for themselves because larry, kirsty, and tiffany are too relieved by, and tired from, their escape to take this in immediately. larry seats himself in the chair, kirsty perches on the end of tiffany's bed. tiffany however walks straight across to her window. she is the first to notice anything. she stares at the flowers.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{tiffany ... ?}
<A>__{kirsty rises from the bed and joins tiffany by the window.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{but these were ... daddy?}
<A>__{larry rises to his feet. just as he stands, a fleeting expression of bewilderment crosses his face. he strokes at his right arm with an unconscious gesture as he crosses the room. kirsty doesn't look at her father right away.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{these flowers. i saw them just...}
<A>__{she looks at her father. a sea of sweat has broken out on his brow and face as he stares intensely at the flowers. kirsty's voice slows, begins to trail off.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{...the day ...before... yesterday daddy? daddy!}
<A>__{larry's eyes close. his entire face screws up as if an excruciating pain just hit him. he clamps his arm across his chest, the hands clutching his shoulders. he opens his eyes and looks at kirsty for a second, his expression one of surprise. then his eyes roll up into the sockets and he collapses to the floor. tiffany has hardly had time to turn from the bowl of flowers before kirsty is kneeling by her father.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{daddy!}
<A>__{larry is unconscious. tiffany gasps. kirsty looks up at her.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{get help.}
<A>__{tiffany's eyes widen. she rushes to the door and disappears into the corridor. within two seconds we hear an emergency alarm go off and tiffany re enters the room.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{pass me a pillow.}
<A>__{tiffany does so and kirsty places it under the head of larry, whose lips are now blue and who is breathing very shallowly. kirsty looks up at tiffany, despair in her eyes.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{what do you do? i just don't know what to do.}
<A>__{tiffany shakes her head helplessly. suddenly, the door to the room flies open and two interns maybe stan and ollie from the carnival sequence come in, complete with stretcher and gurney. they assess the situation with a glance and it is serious enough to make one of them break their professional silence.}
<C>__{intern}
<D>__{coronary arrest. let's be quick.}
<A>__{they are good at their job within seconds larry is secured on the gurney and they head for the door, kirsty and tiffany behind them. the following exchanges are spoken on the move.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{is he going to be 0.k.?}
<C>__{intern}
<D>__{we just can't say. o.r.'s on standby. they'll do what they can.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{but it's bad?}
<A>__{the interns exchange a glance and decide honesty is best.}
<C>__{intern}
<P>__{(gently but flatly)}
<D>__{yeah. it's bad.}
