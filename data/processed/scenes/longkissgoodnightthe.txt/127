<A>__{marksman, riding shotgun. scans the cliff below: thick evergreens. charly, somewhere among them. he sights down his rifle, takes careful aim blows out tires on the jaguar. cripples it. the chopper banks, heading away. back with charly same time in big trouble. many headlights, bouncing uphill toward her. cut off, they've cut her off the other direction ain't much better: a 200 foot drop. straight down. evergreen trees, far below. power lines. highway. she hears the phone ringing, then... inside the jag. crosses slowly. reaches in, lifts the receiver. it's timothy.}

<D>__{then i better hurry.}
<C>__{timothy}
<D>__{oh, spare me. you made a big noise and bought five more minutes on the planet. give up. die. i will spit in what's left of your face.}
<A>__{he clicks off. charly drops the receiver. turns, looks behind: they're coming for her. woods filled with headlights. backlit figures. ducking in and out of the trees, getting closer... the wind blows. bitter cold out here in the dark night of the soul. nothing left. no hope. no reason. caitlin, dead. the rage explodes in the form of a kick which shatters the lock on the trunk. dammit, she needs a fucking miracle. at that moment, the trunk lid slowly rises, creaking... revealing all of timothy's bunjee jumping equipment.}
