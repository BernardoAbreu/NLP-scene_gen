<A>__{conan's eyes pop open. he inhales sharply, gripped by the dream. the room is dark, surrounded by thick draperies. conan lies on a straw bed with white sheets, soaked through with his sweat. he looks to his wounds, all bandaged. he rises a bit too fast because he falls back to his bed.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{i wouldn't move so fast. i bound your wounds as best i could, but i'm no healer.}
<A>__{conan looks over to discover tamara sitting nearby.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{where am i?}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{on the wasp. you told me where it laid, just before you passed out. though i can't say as i feel much safer here.}
<A>__{conan's response is to rise again, his face contorting in pain.}
<C>__{tamara }
<D>__{don't embarrass me with thanks, i only saved your life.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{you were adequate.}
<A>__{conan pulls aside one of the thick draperies that surround his bed. behind it lies a staircase, which he ascends.}
