<A>__{stages shots of crowd people looking on. the images are grainy to match the tone of the zapruder film. people are on rooftops, hollering. the crowd is wild with enthusiasm. we pan past jack ruby and slam into him in black and white. the camera shows a cuban man with a radio; a man with an umbrella; subliminals. through open windows on the fifth floor of the criminal courts building, convicts watch and holler from their jail cells. we see the sixth floor of the texas book depository with open windows and a vague blur of a figure and a rifle. the clock on the hertz sign reads 12:30.}

<D>__{we'll be there in about five minutes.}
<A>__{a motorcycle officer paralleling the kennedy car tries to use his radio. it's jammed. the sound of the jammed dictabelt drives the rest of the sequence. we see zapruder, a short middle aged man, shooting his 8mm film from the grassy knoll, and then we see jackie kennedy floating on film, her voice, high, soft:}
