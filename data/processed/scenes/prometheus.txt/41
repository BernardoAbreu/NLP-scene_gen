<L>__{exterior magellan (in atmosphere)}
<A>__{the prospecting ship descends through buffeting grey clouds. telescopes and antennae stowed away. hull streaming vapor as it cuts atmosphere. lightning flashes and booms around the descending ship.}
<L>__{interior magellan bridge}
<A>__{everyone strapped into chairs except janek, who stands gripping a stanchion, his boots planted on the deck. the landing engines roar. wind screams over the hull. mist whips across the bridge window, obscuring any view. watts reaches out. squeezes holloway's hand. the magellan breaks through the cloud cover into clear air. below the ship, a vast and eerie landscape is revealed. wide valleys mottled with thin dark ground cover. barren crags and spires of rock. waterless and wind swept. watts gasps. stares at the grim and foreign country.}
