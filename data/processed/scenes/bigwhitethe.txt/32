<A>__{margaret, still in her bathrobe, walks to the fridge. as she puts her hand on the latch, she notices the pile of pop cans on the floor. she tugs on the door. it opens just a crack before the chain stops it. the frozen head peeks through the slight gap. margaret sighs, tries to push the fridge door closed, but the body is in the way. she gives the door a hip check. the door latches shut while something frozen and brittle inside cracks. margaret, oblivious, walks away.}
