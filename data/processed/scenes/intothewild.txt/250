<D>__{instincts that seem to sense the threat of a loss so huge and irreparable that the mind balks at taking its measure i begin to wonder if i do understand what chris is saying any longer. but i catch myself in doubt and remember that these are not the parents he grew up with. that in the forced reflection that comes with loss, indeed everything chris is saying, has to be said. and i trust for him that everything he is doing has to be done. this is our life.}
