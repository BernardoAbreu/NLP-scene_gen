<L>__{exterior train trestle night}
<A>__{the static mixes back into the roar of the train. the roar grows distant and is replaced by norah's laughter. still laughing, norah takes a sip of her beer and sets it on a beam next to her. the beer falls. norah tries to catch it, loses her balance and falls with a thud. lynn catches her breath.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{oh, shit.}
<A>__{lynn runs over to find norah on her back, eyes closed. norah opens her eyes and laughs.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{you idiot.}
<A>__{norah grabs the beer that she had been chasing. there's not much left but she downs the remainder.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{sneaky fucker.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{that was really stupid.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{i think i broke my hand.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{really?}
<A>__{lynn leans close with real concern.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{no. but it hurts like a mother.}
<A>__{lynn pops the top on the remaining beer and takes a huge gulp before handing it to norah.}
