<D>__{dis mount!}
<A>__{riders climb down from their mounts... and only now do we realize that this is a troop of boy scouts, all of them about thirteen years of age. the "commanding officer" is only their scoutmaster, mr. havelock. one of the scouts, a pudgy kid named herman, steps away from his horse, bends over and pukes. the other scouts rag on him.}
<C>__{first scout}
<D>__{herman's horsesick!}
<A>__{a blond scout, however, befriends herman. he has a thatch of straw colored hair and the no nonsense expression common to kids whose curiosity and appetite for knowledge exceed what they teach in school. additionally, he has adorned his uniform with an authentic hopi indian woven belt.}

<D>__{chaps, don't anybody wander off. some of the passageways in here can run for miles.}
<A>__{two boy scouts climb up the rocky base of the cliff.}
<L>__{interior the passageway day}
<A>__{the two boys head down the passageway. it's dark, and the temperature drops several degrees. spiders have built huge webs that get caught in the boys' hair. herman appears very uncertain as to the wisdom of this enterprise, but he's drawn on by his companion's adventurous curiosity.}
<C>__{herman}
<D>__{i don't think this is such a good idea.}
<A>__{laughter is heard; the blond scout pulls herman forward toward its source. the voices grow louder now as the boys get closer to their source. the light of kerosene lanterns dances on the tunnel walls ahead. the boys approach cautiously, careful to stay hidden.}
<C>__{herman}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{this is what they see: four men digging with shovels and pick axes. they have broken into one of the pueblo's secret chambers... called "kivas." the men are rough rider (his name describes his dress), roscoe (a bowery boy bully of 14) and halfbreed (with straight black hair that cascades over his shoulders). and the fourth man wears a leather waist jacket and brown felt fedora hat. he has his back turned to us, but we would be willing to bet anything that this is indlana jones. however, when the man turns, and his face is illuminated by the lantern's glow, we are shocked to discover that it is someone else. we'll call him fedora.}

<A>__{indy stays hidden, but is astounded by what he sees.}
<C>__{indy}

<D>__{thank you, doctor.}
<A>__{elsa and indy exchange looks. he thinks he is seeing her in her true colors. elsa chooses a cupa solid gold, emerald encrusted goblet. donovan instantly takes it from her.}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{oh, yes. it's more beautiful than i'd ever imagined. this certainly is the cup of the king of kings.}
<A>__{donovan rushes to the well and fills the goblet with water.}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{eternal life!}
<A>__{donovan drinks from the goblet. then, donovan's entire body starts to convulse. his face contorts in agony. he grabs his stomach and turns toward elsa.}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{what . . . is . . . happening. . . to . . . me. . .?}
<A>__{he starts to agefast! his hair grows long and gray and brittle. his face sinks. fingernails curl back on themselves. milky cataracts coat his eyes. elsa gasps and screams.}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{what. . . is . . . happening. . . ?}
<A>__{his skin turns brown and leathery and stretches across his bones until it splits. his skeletal hands reach for elsa's throat, choking her. indy rushes forward and pushes donovan away. as he falls he body breaks}

<C>__{knight}
<D>__{he chose...poorly.}

<C>__{indy}
<D>__{that's the cup of a carpenter.}
<A>__{he and elsa exchange a look.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{there's only one way to find out.}
<A>__{indy goes to the well and fills the earthenware jug with water, then pauses. indy brings the jug to his lips and takes several large swallows. a strange sensation overcomes him, a feeling of peace and contentment...and we see his wounds begin to heal.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{you have chosen wisely. but the grail cannot pass beyond the great seal. that is the boundary and the price of immortality.}
<T>__{cut to brody and sallah :}
<A>__{who attend to henry awaiting indy's return. indy and elsa come forward with the grail. the two nazi soldiers are over awed by the possessors of the grail. they put down their guns and kneel. indy kneels by henry's side and tilts his head forward and holds the grail to his lips. henry is too weak to even open his eyes. henry swallows some of the water. much of it runs down the corners of his mouth. finally indy pours the water over the wound and everyone watches in astonishment as the wound and the blood stain disappear before their eyes. the color returns to henry's face. henry's eyes open. the first thing he sees is the grail and they light up. then they shift to indy's faceand they light up even more...}

<A>__{a rumbling sound is heard and the ground roars and shifts. dirt falls from the ceiling of the cavern. elsa falls on the great seal. the grail bounces away from her grasp. she reaches for it and the ground beneath her begins to split open. elsa slips into the crevasse. she screams. elsa is hanging perilously in the abyss, with the grail almost within her reach. as her hands lose their grip, indy just manages to one of them, he himself sliding forward across the slanted floor.}
