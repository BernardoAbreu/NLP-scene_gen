<A>__{vanessa slides her briefcase off her shoulder and ventures into the living room. she's struggling to carry some oversized shopping bags.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{mark? are you home? i want to show you some things i picked up.}
<A>__{juno intercepts her breathlessly, clutching the ultrasound photo. mark trails behind her.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{hi vanessa!}
<A>__{vanessa jumps and makes a strangled sound.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{juno! god, you startled me. what are you doing here? what's wrong?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{nothing...}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{then what's going on?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i went to the doctor today.}
<A>__{vanessa is obviously entertaining some worse case scenarios. her eyes are wide and she's uncharacteristically ruffled.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{is the baby okay?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{sure. it's the right size and everything. i even saw its phalanges today! check this...}
<A>__{she holds the ultrasound up to show vanessa and drapes her arm around her.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{what...}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{this is the baby. your baby.}
<A>__{vanessa drops the shopping bags, sick with relief.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{oh my god...}
<C>__{juno}
<P>__{(kindly)}
<D>__{doesn't it look like it's waving? it's kind of like it's saying "hi, vanessa. will you be my mommy?"}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{yeah. yeah, it kind of does.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i came over as soon as i got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. my stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<P>__{(distracted)}
<D>__{oh, that's great!}
<A>__{she can't divert her gaze from the photo.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{see? nothing to worry about.}
<A>__{vanessa chuckles tightly, clearly embarrassed by her show of emotion.}
