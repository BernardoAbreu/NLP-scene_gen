<L>__{exterior jungle night}
<A>__{eddie carr is in the driver's seat of the jeep, racing through the jungle as fast as he can.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{hang on hang on }
<A>__{the foliage smacks the windshield, then clears suddenly, revealing the endangered trailers on the cliffside ahead of him. the jeep bounces through the deep footprints left by the rex and skids to a halt.}
<L>__{interior trailer night}
<A>__{sarah loses her grip on the sink and falls, smashing into the frame of the half broken rear window again. outside, eddie bolts out of the car and runs to the front trailer. he shouts in through the broken front window.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{hey! hello?!}
<A>__{in the rear trailer, the three look up from their precarious positions.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{we're in here! get some rope!}
<A>__{outside, eddie turns and run back to the jeep. he grabs a coil of rope, secures one end around a tree, and hurries back to the trailer. in the rear trailer, eddie dashes over the mess in the front trailer and crawls out into the extended connector. he peers over the edge, down into the second trailer, and tosses the rope.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{catch!}
<A>__{the rope falls through the center of the trailer, its end dangling all the way out the smashed rear window. but the trailer shudders, starting to move again.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{we're sliding!}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{climbs up if you can!}
<A>__{outside, eddie runs out of the trailer in time to see the wheels dragging forward through the mud as the weight of the dangling trailer pulls the whole thing toward the edge of the cliff. he runs for the jeep and grabs hold of the power winch on the front grill. behind him, the trailer rolls closer to the edge of the cliff. eddie races back to the trailer, pulling out a length of cable behind him. he runs up to the still moving trailer, dives for its towing hook, the cable goes taut and he falls short. just by six inches, but he's out of cable.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{damn it!}
<A>__{inside the trailer, nick and sarah are now together, clinging to the rope near the bottom of the trailer as it shifts around them. malcolm is further up, also clinging to the rope. outside, dirt and rocks pile up around the wheels and spill over the edge of the cliff. eddie, back at the jeep, reels out more winch cable. he turns and races back to the trailer just as gravity starts to lift the front end off the ground! eddie dives again, and this time the cable hook clicks securely into the trailer's towing hook. the trailer lurches toward the edge of the cliff and stops. but the jeep is jerked forward by the sudden pressure. in the trailer, malcolm clings to the rope in the middle of the trailer while nick and sarah try to struggle up it, but a sudden dig knocks them back, and their hands slide down the line. screaming, they slide through the trailer and their feet smash through the remains of the rear window. regaining hold of the rope at the very end, the two of them now find themselves hanging out of the rear end of the trailer, dangling over the rocky shore below. in the jeep, eddie hits the gas and the tires slosh in the mud, trying to get a grip. the jeep pulls just enough to lower the front trailer back to earth. but the tires spin, fighting to hold it there.}
<B>__{on the cliffside}
<A>__{sarah and nick dangle, desperate.}
<B>__{in the jeep}
<A>__{eddie chunks the shifter into four wheel drive and guns the engine. as the motor roars, the sound is topped by another roar, in the distance. and this one's not a machine. but eddie doesn't hear it. he guns the engine again. there is another roar from the jungle. eddie hears this one. he darts a look at the side view mirror. in it, he sees one of the tyrannosaurs bolt out of the jungle behind him. he gasps and looks at the other side view. in it, he sees the other rex racing toward him. the tyrannosaurs stomp forward to confront the roaring jeep. the first rex bends over, chomps down on the rear tire, and lifts the car to its teeth. but the spinning tire lings in the rex's mouth, burning it. surprised by the fight in this foe, the rex loses its grip and the jeep bangs back down onto the ground. eddie, horrified, dives down under the steering wheel, to get away. the gas pedal pops up which makes the trailer pitch over the side of the cliff. but the rex stomps down on the jeep to prevent its escape. the trailers stop. now the rexes lean down, over the jeep, and focus on eddie, who still covers under the steering wheel. the first rex snaps at him, hitting the steering column with it, leaving eddie fully exposed. he screams and the second rex lashes in, seizing him in its teeth and tossing him out of the car. eddie pops up into the air between the two rexes, both their heads flash at him at the same time, and in a split second, he disappears between their teeth. now completely ignored, the jeep rolls freely forward and the trailers drop over the edge of the cliff. inside the trailer, nick, sarah and malcolm cling to each other and the rope as the trailers fall around them. the windows flash by as the trailers plummet, equipment bangs and scrapes them, but they hold on to the rope, still tied to the tree, for dear life. on the cliffside, the trailers slide the rest of the way, exposing the three, who pop out the space where the front windshield was. dangling from the rope, they look up and see the jeep, which is now rolling to the edge of the cliff. it falls, past them, and the whole mess explodes on the rocks below. finally, it is silent, except for the sound of the surf.}
