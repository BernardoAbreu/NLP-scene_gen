<D>__{my father wouldn't approve of that that}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{you don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.}
<A>__{she turns to look at him.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{oh, so now you think you know me?}

<C>__{kat}
<D>__{the only thing people know about me is that i'm "scary".}
<A>__{he turns to look at her she looks anything but scary right now. he tries to hide his smile.}
<C>__{patrick}
<A>__{yeah well, i'm no picnic myself. they eye each other, sharing a moment of connection, realizing they're both created the same exterior for themselves. patrick pulls into her driveway and shuts off the motor. he looks up at her house.}

<A>__{kat stares at him with new admiration.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{you know you're not as vile as i thought you were.}
<A>__{she leans drunkenly toward him. their faces grow closer as if they're about to kiss and then patrick turns away}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{so, i will see you in school}
<A>__{kat stares at him, pissed. then gets out of the car, slamming the door shut behind her. cameron's car night bianca and cameron ride in silence. he finally breaks it.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{i looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".}

<A>__{bianca thinks a minute he pulls up in front of the house}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{just because you're beautiful, doesn't mean you can treat people like they don't matter.}
<A>__{she looks at him for a moment then grabs his face and gives him a kiss on the lips. he draws back in surprise, then kisses her back. she smiles, then gets out of the car without another word. cameron grins and drives away}
