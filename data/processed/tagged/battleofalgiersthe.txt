<L>__{1 villa headquarters. inside. night.}
<A>__{inside a three story villa, just built, with whitewashed walls. an elevator shaft is empty, the large cables dangle. on every landing two apartments. the front doors are wide open. whitewash on the floor of the halls, swirls of whitewash on the windowpanes, naked light bulbs hung from electric wires. the rooms contain hardly any furnishings. the kitchens are still without sinks and stoves. an agitated bustle, a rhythm of efficiency. paratroopers go up and down the stairs, pass along the halls, enter and leave the rooms. the sounds in the background are indecipherable. shouted orders, cries, howls. shouts, half spoken remarks, laughs.}
<B>__{somewhere a gramophone is playing at full blast.}
<A>__{the scene is tense. no pauses. when the paras are tired, they move to another room. they sit down, stretch out on the floor, drink coffee or beer, and smoke cigarettes while awaiting the next shift. suddenly, the rhythm of this routine, the timing of these images is upset. a para rushes down the stairs, and asks cheerfully while running:}
<C>__{marc}
<D>__{the colonel. where's the colonel?}
<C>__{paras}
<D>__{why? what's happening?}
<C>__{marc}
<D>__{we know where ali la pointe is. one of them "spoke" ...}
<A>__{his voice echoes through the corridors, on the landings, from one floor to another. the excitement is contagious. many crowd around the door of the kitchen. the algerian who has "spoken" is there. he is young with a thin face and feverish eyes. the paras are all around him: they help him stand up, dry him, clean his face with a rag, give him some coffee in a thermos cover. they are full of attention, sincerely concerned. one of them tries to push away the others.}
<C>__{para}
<D>__{c'mon, let him breathe!}
<A>__{meanwhile others who are arriving ask if it is true.}
<C>__{other paras}
<D>__{so he spoke? does he really know where ali is?}
<C>__{marc}
<D>__{it seems so. we'll go see. give him a little coffee.}
<A>__{marc is tall and husky, his eyes young and cheerful. one of the others asks him with a shade of admiration:}
<C>__{para}
<D>__{hey marc, you made him talk?}
<C>__{marc}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{he then begins to smoke again, and moves aside to rest a bit. the algerian is trying to drink, but his hands are trembling. someone helps him and holds still the cover of the thermos, drawing it to his mouth:}
<C>__{lagloy}
<D>__{c'mon sadek ... drink, you'll feel better.}
<A>__{the algerian drinks, but his stomach can't take it, causing him to double over and vomit again. colonel mathieu enters, elegant and graceful.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{at ease. is it true?}
<C>__{marc}
<D>__{i think so. rue des abderames three ...}
<A>__{the colonel turns to the para, who had gone to call him, and who is holding a pair of camouflage fatigues in his hands.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{dress him.}
<A>__{then he goes near the algerian, lifts his chin, inspects him for a moment with curiosity.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{chin up, it's all over. nothing can happen to you now, you'll see. can you stand up?}
<A>__{the algerian nods yes. the colonel turns to the paras who are holding him up.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{let him go.}
<A>__{he takes the camouflage fatigues and hands them to the algerian.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{here, put them on.}
<A>__{the algerian mechanically takes the fatigues, but he doesn't understand. the colonel explains to him:}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{we're trying to help you. we're going to the casbah. dressed like this, they won't be able to recognize you. understand? we're going to see the place, then you'll be free ... and under our protection ...}
<A>__{the algerian shivers from the cold. he is completely naked. he laboriously puts on the fatigues which are too big for him.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{go on, give him the cap.}
<A>__{they give him a wide belt and buckle it. the other paras, one on either side of him, pull up his sleeves to the elbows. a third places the cap on his head and cocks it.}
<C>__{lagloy}
<D>__{nationalized!}
<A>__{the colonel turn to him angrily:}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{don't be an idiot, lagloy!}
<A>__{the algerian is ready. the paras look at him repressing their laughter. the algerian continues to tremble. his breath is short, his eyes glossy. he is crying.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{the algerian looks around. he breathes deeply. then, suddenly, unexpectedly, he lets out a hoarse cry:}
<C>__{sadek}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{and tries to jerk forward toward the window. marc seizes him immediately, and with his right hand grabs him by the chest, almost lifting him. with his left hand he gives him two quick slaps, not very hard.}
<C>__{marc}
<P>__{(persuadingly)}
<D>__{what do you think you're doing, you fool? do you want us to start all over again? c'mon, be good. don't make me look like an idiot in front of the others.}
<A>__{he makes a reassuring sign to the colonel. then, he takes the algerian by the arms, and they move off.}
<L>__{2 streets of algiers. outside. dawn. october 7, 1957.}
<A>__{the city is gray and white, by the sea which looks like milk. the dawn outlines her features sharply. the streets and wide avenues of the european quarters are empty. silence, until gradually is heard ...}
<B>__{a humming of motors.}
<A>__{one truck after another. their headlights on, with an opaque glow, by now useless. a line of trucks follow one another along the sea front, all at the same speed. they turn right and go up toward place du gouvernement. here, without stopping, the columns divide in two. the two lines enter each of the two roads that lead up to surround the casbah. in the brighter light, the casbah appears completely white, limestone. enclosed by the european city, it stands at a greater height and overlooks it. mosaic of terraces. white pavement, pavement interspersed by the black outlays of narrow alleys. only a jump from one terrace to another ... agile and silent, the paras jump one by one from the trucks in a hurry.}
<B>__{sound of trucks.}
<A>__{they arrange themselves geometrically, their movements synchronized. they disperse and disappear in the alleys. they reappear together, then once again scatter. they meet without looking at one another; each one takes his own course. in like manner without a sound, they are above, even on the terraces, in perfect geometry. even up here, the paras tighten their grip ...}
<L>__{3 rue des abderames. courtyard of house. inside outside. dawn.}
<A>__{every three yards, there is a para, even at all four corners of an intersection. they are also in the side streets as well as the main streets. and also above, against the sky, many other paras appear. number three. the doorway is the height of a man. a squadron stands ready in a semicircle with machine guns in firing position. marc continues to hold up the algerian by his arm. the captain glances at his watch, then looks up at the terrace and gives a signal. in a lowered voice, without turning around, he speaks to the para who is at his back:}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{fire ...}
<A>__{the para nears the front door, his legs wide open, his machine gun, clenched at his side, and aims at the lock.}
<B>__{machine gun fire.}
<A>__{he moves the gun barrel in a circular direction. immediately the others hurl themselves against the door. at the same time, the door of the terrace is broken down, and the paras burst into the house below. the inner courtyard is square. in the center there is a well; above, a patch of sky; on four sides, the arcades, columns, and majolica arches. beneath the porches, there is a door for every dwelling. and above, a balcony with railings and other doors. the doors are wide open. the paras quickly carry out their orders. orders, curt and brief. the people are used to all this and know how to obey. the scene takes place exactly as if it were an arranged maneuver, a practice drill. the rooms are emptied in a few seconds. the people are crowded together in the courtyard. eyes wide with fright. men, women, and children with blankets and sheets thrown around their shoulders. by now, it is almost day. a soft light is diffused from above. the algerian walks with his head lowered, marc on one side, the captain on, the other. they climb to the first floor and go along the balcony. the algerian stops in front of a door. the captain murmurs softly:}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{here?}
<A>__{the algerian nods yes. they enter.}
<L>__{4 ali's room. inside. dawn.}
<A>__{the room is badly lit. there is a mattress on the floor, and another on the table, a cupboard against the wall, some chairs. nothing else. at the back of the room to the left, there is a dividing curtain hung by a cord at medium height. the curtain is drawn and a large bed with brass headboards is visible. the algerian points in that direction; the captain signals for him to go there. they go forward silently, and push aside the curtain. there is a small light bulb hung on the wall beneath a small shelf covered with postcards and photos. the baseboard all around is more than three feet tall and is covered by majolica tiles. the algerian points to a spot in the brick structure, on the back wall, between the headboard of the bed and a corner of the room. marc and the captain have their machine guns ready. the captain goes near the wall, his breath drawn, and begins to examine it. he runs the fingernail of his thumb along the wall horizontally, between one row of tiles and another. he taps the tiles at different places until he hears the plaster in the interstices crumble. he looks at the bit of plaster that is left in his nail. he squeezes it in his fingertips; it is soft, newly laid. then he bends over, places his ear to the wall, and listens. suddenly he smiles.}
<L>__{5 ali's hiding place. inside.}
<A>__{there isn't enough air in the hiding place. the four are forced to breathe deeply. and in that small space their laborious breaths resound like splashes. ali la pointe has his eyes fixed upon the square patch of wall that seals the hiding place. his eyes are large, black, slanted, his eyelids heavy, somewhat lowered, so that the black of the irises appears even blacker in the shadows, deeper and more sullen. petit omar is with him, a boy of twelve, and mahmoud who is eighteen. there is also hassiba, a kabyle girl, blond, blue eyed, and fair skinned. the hiding place is only five feet high, and hardly holds them. they are sitting or stretched out on the ground, close to one another. the entrance to the hiding place is blocked by the small patch of wall which matches exactly the rest. it is held firm by a bar through an iron ring attached at the center. on the other side of the cell, above them, there is a hole for air. they are tense and do not move. their lips are dry, half open, and their breasts rise and fall in a difficult attempt to breathe.}
<C>__{captain}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{ali la pointe ... the house is surrounded. you haven't got a chance. surrender. let the child and the girl come out, then you and the other one. leave your weapons inside. it's useless to try anything. our machine guns are ready to fire you wouldn't have time. do you understand?}
<A>__{ali's face is motionless and hasn't changed its expression.}
<C>__{captain}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{ali, do you hear me? listen! you are the last one. the organization is finished. all your friends are dead or in prison. come out. you'll have a fair trial. come out, surrender.}
<A>__{sound of footsteps, other voices, cheerful, incoherent:}
<C>__{voices paras}
<D>__{why are they breathing so heavily? fear ... air ... they haven't got enough air inside ...}
<A>__{and again the voice of the captain, clear and somewhat distant:}
<C>__{captain}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{make up your mind, ali? do you want us to wall you in, or do you prefer that we blow you to pieces? ... alright. so much the worse for you.}

<A>__{two hands are moving; one over the other, they criss cross with incredible speed; at the same time, they are shifting three small pieces of wood which appear to be identical. the hand movements are marked by a kind of algerian chant. from time to time, the pieces of wood are overturned for a split second so that the other sides are visible. robust hands, thick, unusually agile for their size. the hands of ali la pointe, younger then, twenty four years old. a european quarter of algiers. coming and going of people, automobile traffic. on the sidewalk a small group of european and two algerian boys. other passersby stop to watch. the group crowds around the stand where ali la pointe is playing his game. the entranced eyes of all present are staring at the pieces of wood. ali's hands seem to move by themselves. his glance, always a bit sullen, apparently distracted, indifferent, passes from one face to another, and then to the street, from one side to another. at fifty yards, a policeman. two europeans, a man and a woman, are speaking to him in an excited manner, and nudging him along pointing to ali.}

<A>__{mathieu writes the new numbers, spacing them on the next line. then he unites two to four and five, and three to six and seven, forming two new triangles. mathieu has written other numbers and unites them to those of the preceding line and thus forms other triangles. now the blackboard is covered by a series of triangles that form a large pyramid.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{the reason for this geometry is so that every militant will know only three members in the entire organization: his commander who has chosen him, and the two members that he himself has chosen ... contacts take place only by written instructions ... that is why we do not know our adversaries: because, in practice, they do not even know each other.}

<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{to know them means to eliminate them. consequently, the military aspect is secondary to the police method. i know we are not fond of this word, but it is the only word that indicates exactly the type of work that we must perform. we must make the necessary investigations in order to proceed from one vertex to another in the entire pyramid. the reason for this work is information. the method is interrogation. and interrogation becomes a method when conducted in a manner so as to always obtain a result, or rather, an answer. in practice, demonstrating a false humanitarianism only leads to the ridiculous and to impotence. i am certain that all the units will understand and react accordingly. however, success does not depend solely on us. we need to have the casbah at our disposal. we must sift through it ... and interrogate everyone. and here is where we find ourselves hindered by a conspiracy of laws and regulations that continue to be operative, as if algiers were a holiday resort and not a battleground. we have requested a carte blanche. but it is very difficult to obtain. therefore, it is necessary to find an excuse to legitimize our intervention, and make it possible. it is necessary to create it ourselves this excuse. unless our adversaries will think of it themselves, which seems to be what they are doing.}

<D>__{no, they'll do even more. we've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... do you understand what i mean? starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self confessed criminal ... and they will be able to pass to the offensive. have you thought of this?}

<C>__{ali}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{no ...}
<C>__{ben m'hidi}

<D>__{no, and neither were my men.}

<D>__{why?}
<C>__{ali}

<C>__{ben m'hidi}
<D>__{that's true ... wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... this is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all algerians, count them and measure their strength ...}

<C>__{ben m'hidi}
<P>__{(smiling slightly)}

<D>__{3rd journalist mr. ben m'hidi, colonel mathieu has said that you have been arrested by accident, practically by mistake. in fact, it seems that the paratroopers were looking for someone much less important than yourself. can you tell us why you were in that apartment at rue debussy last night?}

<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{you should address that question to the minister's spokesman. i'm not the one who made those statements ... on my part, i will say that i had the opportunity to admire the moral strength, intelligence, and unwavering idealism demonstrated by ben m'hidi. for these reasons, although remembering the danger he represented, i do not hesitate to pay homage to his memory. 2nd journalist colonel mathieu ... much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... can you tell us something about this?}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{the successes obtained are the results of those methods. one presupposes the other and vice versa. 3rd journalist excuse me, colonel. i have the impression that perhaps due to excessive prudence ... my colleagues continue to ask the same allusive questions, to which you can only respond in an allusive manner. i think it would be better to call things by their right names; if one means torture, then one should call it torture.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{i understand. what's your question? 3rd journalist the questions have already been asked. i would only like some precise answers, that's all ...}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{let's try to be precise then. the word "torture" does not appear in our orders. we have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. as for the nlf, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty four hours, and then, they may talk. thus, the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... what type of interrogation should we choose? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months? 3rd journalist the law is often inconvenient, colonel ...}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{and those who explode bombs in public places, do they perhaps respect the law? when you asked that question to ben m'hidi, remember what he said? no, gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious circle. and we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions. because the problem does not lie here. the problem is: the nlf wants us to leave algeria and we want to remain. now, it seems to me that, despite varying shades of opinion, you all agree that we must remain. when the rebellion first began, there were not even shades of opinion. all the newspapers, even the left wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. and we were sent here for this very reason. and we are neither madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. those who call us fascists today, forget the contribution that many of us made to the resistance. those who call us nazis, do not know that among us there are survivors of dachau and buchenwald. we are soldiers and our only duty is to win. therefore, to be precise, i would now like to ask you a question: should france remain in algeria? if you answer "yes," then you must accept all the necessary consequences.}

<C>__{kader}
<D>__{okay ... you can tell the colonel to blow up whatever he likes. go on, now.}

<D>__{he said that you can blow up whatever you like ...}
<A>__{she, then, rejoins the other women. mathieu seems to be tired, he has lost weight, he is nervous. he turns to his men, and slowly as he gives the orders, the paras begin to move.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{return to where the others are. prepare the plastic. it should be placed on the ceiling of the stairway under the hiding place ... a long fuse rolled up ... take cover ... keep shooting while you are working. quickly! clear the house ... bring them outside, then check the rooms again ... hurry up!}
<A>__{kader gives zohra a box of matches. she goes to the back of the hiding place where there is a bundle of papers. she lights them, then returns near to kader who is inspecting the magazine of his machine gun. there are only two shots left. the other empty magazines are scattered around. kader turns to zohra, and starts to speak, but suddenly his words are blurred by the sound of shots. kader and zohra have to step back a little, because the shells are flashing at the edge of the opening. the shooting stops. from the stairway, one end of a long fuse is thrown into the corridor. the other end is inserted into a plastic charge fastened to the ceiling of the stairway, under the hiding place. kader and zohra can see two or three yards in front of them, below, into the corridor, where the end of the fuse is glowing and burning. kader too has lost weight, his beard is long. he looks at the fuse, then at zohra. a second passes in silence. now zohra too looks at him, and kader says calmly in his usual voice:}

<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{if you had let me blow you up, you would have disappointed me ...}
<A>__{kader turns to him, and replies, trying to maintain his own voice at the same level of indifference:}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{for many months, i've had your photo on my desk together with a dozen or so reports on you ... and naturally, i am under the illusion that i know you somewhat. you never seemed the type, kader, inclined to performing useless actions.}
<A>__{kader doesn't answer right away, then speaks slowly as if expressing the results of his doubts, a new point of view ...}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{you seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ...}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{of course i am.}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{that proves that i was wrong. evidently i credited you with an advantage greater than i should have.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{no. let's just say that you've given me the satisfaction to have guessed correctly. but from the technical point of view, it isn't possible to speak of advantages. by now the game is over. the nlf has been defeated.}
<A>__{zohra has turned around suddenly. she is crying and speaks hastily in arabic, violently, harshly. mathieu doesn't understand, and turns to kader to ask him politely, although with a bit of irony:}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{what is she saying?}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{she says that ali is still in the casbah.}
<L>__{131 crowded beach. outside. day.}
<A>__{ali la pointe's glance is sullen, heavy, motionless. he moves his head slowly in such a way so that his glance also moves in a semicircle. white beach, fine sand, transparent sea, bodies stretched out in the sun, golden skin of girls; girls in bikinis, sensual, smiling, young men with narrow hips, with muscles well cared for, cheerful youth, naturally happy, enviable. the children are building sand castles near the water's edge; the beach is shaped like a half moon with rocky reefs at both ends ... a september sunday, warm and calm. ali is leaning on the wall. he is wearing a white wool cloak. only his eyes are visible ... the eyes of a hungry tiger perched above a path, on the lookout for innocent prey. eyes that now gleam, cruel eyes, tension dilating the pupils ... then again the calm, a gloomy calm, a gratifying tension. the place is right, and the victims couldn't be better ones. ali moves, leaves the wall, crosses the street to a large city sanitation truck, one of those metallic trucks with no visible openings. a young algerian is at the steering wheel, a street cleaner. he is leaning his thin face on the wheel. his hands are dirty, by now unwashable from years of work. ali has climbed into the cab. the truck is in motion and leaves.}

<A>__{the name of the street cleaner is sadek. he seems frightened. he looks around, hesitates before speaking.}
<C>__{sadek}
<D>__{then the beach is okay, ali.}
<A>__{silence. sadek looks at him again, waiting, but ali does not respond. ali looks straight ahead at the street bathed in sunlight, the tar that seems to be liquid, the villas that surround algiers, the lemon trees, the oleanders ... then he speaks, but without turning to sadek. he speaks in a whisper, his eyes continually staring straight ahead.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{we need two more, the biggest ones.}
<C>__{sadek}
<D>__{and the others?}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{the others ... let's wait and see.}

<C>__{sadek}
<D>__{i've looked, ali, even where i work. nothing. the ones who have not been arrested have left algiers and gone into the mountains ... and the others don't want to hear any more about it ... they're afraid ...}
<A>__{ali doesn't answer him. silence.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{can't you go any faster?}
<C>__{sadek}
<D>__{yes, sure ... here.}
<A>__{sadek puts the truck in third gear, accelerates the motor, then shifts back again into fourth gear. the truck increases its speed. the road is straight, the outskirts of algiers are visible.}
<C>__{sadek}
<D>__{if we don't find any others ... should we call it off?}
<A>__{ali turns suddenly to look at him but says nothing. sadek can feel those eyes on him, and tries to justify himself.}
<C>__{sadek}
<D>__{we can't plant all of them by ourselves ...}

<A>__{night. at number three rue des abderames, on the first floor balcony, the stove fires are glowing. the women are cooking outside on their stoves built from tin containers. they are cooking in front of the doors of their homes. the doorways are lit up. ali passes along the balcony, passes by mahmoud and his wife who are speaking in whispers by themselves and leaning on the railing. it is a warm and starry night. mahmoud says some more words to his wife, still speaking in whispers, tenderly. then he follows ali who has stopped in front of the door.}
<L>__{134 ali's room. inside. night.}
<A>__{in the room, there is petit omar who is cutting out some pictures from a comic book. as soon as he sees ali at the door, he stops, closes his book, puts the scissors in his pocket. he seems to be embarrassed at being caught in his childish game. in the center of the room, there is a dividing curtain, pulled halfway to the side. on the other side, hassiba is typing. behind hassiba, next to the bed, the hiding place is open. ali enters. he seems tired, sweating. he removes his cloak, tosses it on the chair, and puts his machine gun on the table.}
<C>__{ali}
<P>__{(turning to petit omar)}
<D>__{c'mon, hurry. go to sleep. tomorrow we four have a lot of work to do: mahmoud, hassiba, you and i.}
<A>__{mahmoud has remained motionless at the door. hassiba has stopped typing and approaches them. omar says nothing, but there is a satisfied look in his eyes. he can't help stretching out his hand to touch the machine gun. ali sits down, at the table, moves the machine gun away from omar, and continues to speak, still talking to omar.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{because we can't find anyone else, sadek will bring us there in the truck. you get out first and plant the bomb where i tell you ... then return here quickly. but be careful that no one is following you. then hassiba will get out, and after her, mahmoud. then i will plant the ones that are left. they'll know that we're still strong ... you can be sure of that.}

<C>__{ali}
<D>__{omar, omar. c'mon, wake up. hurry, little one. today you're going to see fireworks.}
<A>__{the child also smiles and his face relaxes, then brightens up. at the same time, he extends his hand and pats ali's side. mahmoud enters the room from the balcony. he is carrying a tray with four cups of coffee.}

<A>__{ali has finished putting on his shoes. he takes a cup of coffee. in the same moment, outside the door is heard: machine gun fire. the four are startled.}
<C>__{ali}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{inside! inside!}
<A>__{simultaneously, all of them move toward the hiding place. mahmoud's wife appears at the door. her face is despairing, but she moves carefully, quickly, precisely. she closes the door. she puts the coffee cups back on the tray, and hides everything in the sink. she goes to the other side of the curtain. ali is entering the hiding place. the other three are already inside. ali pushes the movable piece of wall toward him, and the woman helps him. then, she takes a can from the night table; it is full of plaster mixed with coal dust. the woman spreads the paste in the joints between the bricks of the wall and the closure of the hiding place. at the same time, shouting, shots, and the footsteps of paras are heard. as soon as she has finished, the woman slips into bed under the sheets. the paratroopers break into the room shouting, and make the woman get up. they drag her outside on the balcony.}

<B>__{heavy breathing.}
<A>__{it is the same breathing that soon after mathieu hears, bent in the same position as the captain. the colonel gets up and looks around him. four paras are ready with their machine guns aimed at the hiding place. others are arranging plastic charges along the wall, all of them connected to a single fuse. in a corner, sadek, wearing his cap and army camouflage fatigues, is sitting on a chair. he is watching the scene with his eyes wide open. he is trembling. his body is slouched forward. he seems to be lifeless, without nerves. if it weren't for his face, he would seem to be a heap of rags.}
