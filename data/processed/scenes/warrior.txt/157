<A>__{fenroy and company watching the big screen. on tv screen: round three. more tommy domination, but brendan}
<B>__{is somehow taking it.}

<A>__{again, tommy is on top of brendan, trying to ground and pound him into submission. frank, leaning on the apron nearby, screams at brendan.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{switch! switch!}
<A>__{tommy tries to pound brendan out, but brendan latches on to tommy's arm, wraps his legs around him, and reverses position, just as he did with midnight, the dane, and koba. tommy is in deep trouble. brendan pushes him face down on the canvas and cranks his shoulder. there's no escape.}

<D>__{oh my god, that's a deep omoplata!}
<C>__{callen }
<D>__{he's doing it again! conlon's doing it again! this is going to be over!}
<A>__{brendan applies intense pressure. tommy's shoulder is contorted, wrenched backwards, and his face is a mask of pain. tommy's in agony, but he won't give in.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{tap, tommy!}
<A>__{tommy shrieks like an animal, but still won't quit. in fact, he elbows brendan in the face in defiance. brendan in turn cranks the shoulder even more. it's at the breaking pointerior}
<C>__{brendan }
<D>__{tap!}
<A>__{the shoulder twists. twists. and then, audible only to tommy and brendan, crack. dislocated. then the horn ending the round. brendan, worried he hurt his brother, leans over to see if tommy's alright, but tommy, like a wounded animal, leaps up and grabs brendan around the throat with his one good arm. he shoves him all the way across the cage and into the fence, and it takes rosenthal and frank to separate them.}
