<L>__{interior restaurant kitchen late afternoon}
<A>__{john cooking...the theory that nobody's sexier than when they are seen doing what they do best applies here.. in the background john's number two, peter, the sous chef, being bossy and anal as he organizes his cooking and gwen, who spends most nights trying not to show her enormous affection for john. at the moment, john's work is a strange mixture of art and cloddishness.....the hands blur with expertise...but he keeps dropping items.....each time a latin kitchen worker, alex, 20, dives on the spillage..at one point they bump.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{sorry...}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(sharply to alex)}
<D>__{not the best place to stand, fella.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(to alex)}
<D>__{no. it's me. you're the new helper, huh..}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i didn't mean to...}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no..no..it's okay. it's me being bugged.}
<A>__{two people head for john almost simultaneously. peg, an arty looking woman in her late 50's..wild, scraggly gray hair, enters lugging an ice chest and the maitre d'.}
<C>__{peg}
<D>__{you are going to be so happy..}
<A>__{the maitre d' enters.}
<C>__{maitre d'}
<D>__{i have something very important to tell you.}
<A>__{john makes a no brainer of a decision pointing to the woman who promised happiness. she hefts her ice chest up on the counter.}
<C>__{peg}
<D>__{perfect cod this is john john, perfect cod..best one i've seen all season and he was swimming twenty minutes ago.}
<A>__{the fish is that special, a sentence that kicks out for a writer, the right brush stroke for an artist. you get it..}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{knockout.}
<P>__{(to alex)}
<D>__{you want to learn something? you want to pack it away?}
<A>__{the kid nods.. he picks up the fish.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{cradle it...put it in the cooler but not on its side.. in the same position it swims.}
<P>__{(important added thought)}
<D>__{and check the ice pack..make sure it can drain away..if it can't the chlorine can hurt the flesh. do all that and nobody can put a fish in the fridge better than you...and that's a solid start.. first day and you already did something perfect.}
<C>__{kid}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{yes, i understand.}
<C>__{maitre d'}
<D>__{please. now?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{oh, sorry..i forgot.}
<A>__{he whispers in john's ear..}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{damn.. "ohhhh damn."}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{what, buddy, what?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{victor spotted a food critic..}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{from?}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{the new york times..i will bet they sent her out just for us.}
<P>__{(hands john a slip)}
<D>__{here's what she ordered.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{look, if you're nervous take a walk..}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i don't need a walk.}
<C>__{gwen}
<D>__{i will walk with you..i know a breathing thing.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what do you think i'm worried about... how i will cook? that's not the problem..}
<P>__{(looks at slip then to alex)}
<D>__{the lady wants fish. get the fish.}
<A>__{he starts to prepare for cooking.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{i worked in a kitchen once in new york that got four stars. it was like a line formed for the chance to become an asshole. people's accents changed. the heart went out of the place. you understand.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{gwen}
<P>__{(w barely understated passion)}
<D>__{i agree with everything you've said. i admire you for your feelings. i hope to adopt them as my own....}
<B>__{on john.}
<A>__{as he works..let's be clear here...this is that sequence that either kicks out or doesn't..no food channel..no simple knife stuff..something casually brilliant..meticulous...smart and gifted as he prepares the critic's meal. he is talking quickly..almost to himself.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i don't know what to root for.. the thought of one star makes me nauseous..but with four there's no place to go but, "oh my god, they took away a star."}
<P>__{(musing)}
<D>__{three..three and a half. that's what you want..no. wrong! three and a half you feel disappointed that you just missed out on four. you know what you want? three and a quarter..}
<P>__{(a eureka moment)}
<D>__{that would be perfect!!}
<P>__{(getting off on it)}
<D>__{it would mean you're good..but you're not good enough to feel disappointed that you just missed out on excellent..but nothing truly bad happened, you still got your three and a quarter stars. which encourages you to try and improve..and you still get enough respect so that you can get good people to work with you..business is good but not crazy. you're right there underneath the radar where you get to mind your own business. that's a solid life.}
<A>__{he tastes a sliver of the food dish he is preparing.}
<C>__{john }
<P>__{(with professional honesty and some regret)}
<D>__{aw, man..this is amazing. no three and a quarter here.}
