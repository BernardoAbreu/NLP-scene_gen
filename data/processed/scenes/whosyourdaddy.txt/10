<D>__{oh, miss pratt, miss pratt! what were you thinking? how could you be so careless?}

<D>__{principal merkin, i realize we have to teach the children that recreational drugs are the devil's work, but that doesn't mean we don't dance with the prince of darkness ourselves, every now and again.}

<A>__{suddenly, an air vent pops open and crashes on top of a coffee machine. the whole room, in shocked silence, turns to look at... julie, her head framed by the air duct. she holds a digital camera in her hand. her expression says: "oh, shit." principal merkin narrows his eyes at the "little bastard" who has been making his life hell.}
