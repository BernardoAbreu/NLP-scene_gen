<L>__{exterior 5th avenue afternoon}
<A>__{we see brooke and robert from overhead like little dots as they cross 5th avenue towards central park.}
<L>__{exterior central park continuous}
<A>__{they walk solemnly towards a park bench in front of a lake. robert sits, motions to brooke.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{you wanna sit?}
<C>__{brooke}
<D>__{i will stand.}
<P>__{(as he sits)}
<D>__{didn't you think i'd find out?}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{i did.}
<C>__{brooke}
<D>__{then why didn't you tell me? goldenrod 4.17.11 64.}
<C>__{robert}
<A>__{because i hoped you wouldn't.}
<C>__{brooke}
<A>__{oh, come on. you tell me the truth now or i am done.}
<C>__{robert}
<A>__{i made a bad bet.}
<C>__{brooke}
<A>__{no, you committed fraud.}
<C>__{robert}
<A>__{that's a dangerous word, brooke.}
<C>__{brooke}
<A>__{what would you prefer? that you cheated? that you stole money from people who trusted you? that you lied? that you lied right to my face? why?}
<C>__{robert}
<A>__{because we were going broke! everything was finished. we'd have nothing.}
<C>__{brooke}
<A>__{how. how does that happen?}
<C>__{robert}
<A>__{you remember alexanderov? well he came to see me one day last year. he said "robert, we've got a great opportunity there's a copper mine, it's in russia, it's under exploited there's billions under the ground, and to get it out, all we need is a couple hundred million, you put in a hundred, we'll put in a hundred we'll triple it all in six months." so, i go check it out. and the geological survey's right, friendly government. and to lock it in, you hedge it, right? sell the copper ahead on the commodities exchange and it all works, it's fine, and you're making a fortune.}
<P>__{(beat, then real fast)}
<D>__{goldenrod 4.17.11 65.}
<C>__{robert }
<A>__{but then there's something i hadn't accounted for variation margin and that friendly russian government all of a sudden not so friendly anymore and they're blocking the export of the copper so i gotta make it up, i gotta put the cash in to cover the hedge. but i'm not worried about it because it's still springing money, there's so much money coming out of the ground you can't believe. you can't stop it. and, yes, i'm the oracle, i've done housing, i've arb'd credit swaps, i have done it all, and yes, again, i know it's outside the charter, but it is fucking minting money! it's a license to print money! for everybody! forever! it is god!...}
<C>__{brooke}
<A>__{until...}
<C>__{robert}
<A>__{until it's not... the money's trapped. you can't get it out. probably never will.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<A>__{it's like a plane crash. it just happens.}
<C>__{brooke}
<A>__{well it does not just happen.}
<C>__{robert}
<A>__{not just happen, honey you are so naive sometimes. it happens. and like every father i pray that it doesn't happen to you, which, thanks to me, it probably won't happen to you...}
<C>__{brooke}
<A>__{thanks to you, we may all be arrested.}
<C>__{robert}
<A>__{nobody's getting arrested. that's why i borrowed the money from jeffrey. plug the hole, i put it there for a month, they see the books are fine, i transfer the company, i pay back jeffrey with interest! make all of our investors whole, and what's left we keep. at least we get to keep the house.}
<D>__{goldenrod 4.17.11 66.}
<C>__{brooke}
<D>__{everybody wins?}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{brooke}
<D>__{if the company sells. if i lie for you.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{you don't have to lie. you didn't know about it.}
<C>__{brooke}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{i'm the chief investment officer of this company. what do you think they'll say at the depositions? "she didn't know?" they'll take away my brokerage license failure to supervise you my name in every paper and blog while i visit your ass in jail!}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{what did you want me to do? did you want me to let our investors go bankrupt? is that what you wanted? for people to get really hurt?}
<C>__{brooke}
<D>__{what... gives you the audacity to think you can make those decisions?}
<C>__{robert}
<P>__{(stands)}
<D>__{because it's my job!}
<C>__{brooke}
<D>__{no, it's illegal. it's illegal. and i am your partner.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{you are not my partner! you work for me!}
<P>__{(off her bewildered stare)}
<D>__{that's right. you work for me!}
<P>__{(sits)}
<D>__{everybody works for me!}
<A>__{they pass a moment in silence. he looks at her destroyed expression.}
<D>__{goldenrod 4.17.11 67.}
<C>__{robert }
<D>__{brooke. brooke. come here. please? please. just, just come here. just for a second and sit down.}
<A>__{she sits.}
<C>__{robert }
<P>__{(deep sigh)}
<D>__{there's something i wanna tell you. and whatever you decide i won't blame you...}
<P>__{(she turns to look at him)}
<D>__{i'm on my own path. it's up to you to move with it or against it. but i'm the patriarch; that's my role. and i have to play it.}
<C>__{brooke}
<P>__{(stares a while, then)}
<D>__{for a moment i thought you were gonna say you were sorry.}
<A>__{she walks off. hold on robert alone in the park.}
<C>__{robert}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
