<L>__{exterior carter's house, back yard night}
<A>__{aaron and troy step out onto the back porch and spot jessica and carlos. upon seeing them, carlos stands straight up.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{aaron's here.}
<A>__{jessica, still pacing, stops in her tracks and turns around beside carlos. it's too late to gracefully exit, so carlos stands there frozen. jessica does not seem afraid. aaron and troy approach. it's clear troy doesn't really want to be there.}
<C>__{aaron}
<P>__{(to carlos)}
<D>__{hey guy.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{you like talking to my girl?}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{aaron, i didn't mean nothin'.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{no? just friends?}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{what's the matter, don't like her that way?}
<A>__{carlos painfully does not answer. jessica, unfazed, takes another hit of whiskey. jessica is confident because of the booze and because of carter's promise. jessica and aaron begin arguing in calm "i'm above this" mannerisms.}
<C>__{aaron }
<P>__{(to carlos)}
<D>__{go 'head, take her home. fuck 'er brains out. she'll give you a little surprise.}
<A>__{carlos simply stands there, ashamed of his inability to act.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{fuck you, i'm clean. you're the cheatin' asshole with bumps on your cock.}
<C>__{aaron}
<P>__{(to troy)}
<D>__{hold this.}
<A>__{aaron hands his beer to troy and then grabs the whiskey jessica is holding. jessica flinches as if afraid aaron would hit her.}
<C>__{aaron }
<D>__{better wipe this off good. you never know.}
<A>__{aaron uses his shirt to vigorously rub the mouth of the bottle before taking a long pull. the whiskey is almost gone. jessica grabs back the whiskey, wipes it off as aaron did, and polishes it off.}
<C>__{aaron }
<D>__{you're good at that. you ready yet to go bang some dude? maybe carlos here?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{fuck you. i'm going to get carter, and he's gonna kick your ass.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{carter ain't gonna kick shit.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{we'll see, right?}
<A>__{jessica moves to leave, but aaron grabs her arm.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{hold on a minute ...}
<A>__{jessica smashes the bottle over aaron's head, knocking aaron to the floor in a daze.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{that's for the pepper spray, asshole!}
<A>__{the partygoers in the back yard are now fixed on jessica and aaron. carter runs over, holding his cigar and a beer. berubi is behind carter, eager for a fight.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{what's goin' on?}
<C>__{troy}
<D>__{she smashed a whiskey bottle over his head.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{he grabbed me! i'm not gonna sit and wait until he hits me again! he can just keep his fuckin' hands off me!}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{he grabbed her?}
<A>__{troy shrugs his shoulders.}
<C>__{troy}
<D>__{i guess so. it wasn't a big deal.}
<C>__{aaron}
<P>__{(recovering, to jessica)}
<D>__{you're dead.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{see?}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{jess, you hit him with a bottle?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{before he fucking hit me!}
<C>__{aaron}
<P>__{(to carter)}
<D>__{look, i ain't got no problem with you.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{fine. you touch her, and i promised her i'd beat the livin' piss outta you. i will do it. lay off.}
<A>__{aaron sits up against a tree, his hands to his head. carter starts to leave. carlos feels even more ashamed that carter stepped in and did something that carlos did not have the courage to do himself.}
<C>__{berubi}
<P>__{(to aaron)}
<D>__{you're lucky.}
<A>__{jessica grabs carter by the shirt.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{carter, what the hell?! you said you were gonna kick his ass!}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{i said i would step in if he hit you, and he's not gonna hit you.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{this is fuckin' bullshit!}
<A>__{jessica winds up and stomps aaron in the groin. aaron growls in pain and doubles over.}
<C>__{troy}
<P>__{(in awe of jessica's ferociousness)}
<D>__{woe, dude.}
<C>__{carter}
<P>__{(to jessica)}
<D>__{jessica! what the fuck are you doing?!}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{if you're not man enough to do what you said, i will!}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{jess, i'm not gettin' into this! i'm sicka' this bullshit with you! you bring this shit on yourself!}
<P>__{(to aaron)}
<D>__{don't touch her.}
<A>__{carter leaves, followed by berubi. jessica watches them leave. she turns down to aaron.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{you know what? i don't need carter. what're you gonna do, tough guy?}
<C>__{aaron}
<P>__{(still recovering)}
<D>__{why don't you give me a minute and see?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{fuck you, you had your minute.}
<A>__{jessica storms toward carlos' car, and carlos follows.}
