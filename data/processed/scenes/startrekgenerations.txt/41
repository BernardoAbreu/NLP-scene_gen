<B>__{.}
<A>__{super: seventy eight years later...}
<B>__{close on a halyard}
<A>__{as a flag is quickly hoisted to the top of a mast. the flag reaches the top and is then caught by the wind the blue and white banner of the united federation of planets waves in the breeze.}
<B>__{move to reveal the location}
<L>__{exterior sailing vessel day}
<A>__{a nineteenth century three masted sailing vessel (about the size of a frigate) is hove to and sitting in the water gently rocking. across the stern of the ship, we can see the name enterprise picked out in gold letters.}
<B>__{on the main deck}
<A>__{where picard and riker are standing before the assembled crew of the ship. everyone is dressed in full dress naval uniforms of the period, complete with cocked hats, epaulettes, etc. the crew is standing at attention... the wind whistles through the rigging... the timbers creak... picard grimly looks over his crew... then finally he nods to riker.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{bring out the prisoner!}
<A>__{a drummer begins a long drum roll.}
<B>__{on a hatch}
<A>__{as worf is brought on deck by troi and geordi. worf is shackled by hand and leg irons. troi and geordi hold him by either arm and shove him toward the captain. the drum roll stops. picard moves to worf and peers at him closely.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{mister worf... i always knew this day would come. are you prepared to face the charges?}
<A>__{worf doesn't answer and troi jabs him in the side.}
<C>__{troi}
<D>__{answer him!}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{i am prepared.}
<A>__{picard looks to riker, who then pulls out a large, rolled piece of parchment. he opens the scroll and begins to read from it. in the b.g. geordi removes worf's shackles.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{"we, the officers and crew of the u.s.s. enterprise, being of sound mind and judgment, hereby make the following charges against lieutenant worf: one. that he did knowingly and willfully perform above and beyond the call of duty on countless occasions. two. that he has been a good and solid officer on this ship for one score less twelve years. and three. most seriously... that he has earned the respect and admiration of the entire crew."}
<A>__{riker puts away the scroll}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{there can be only one punishment for such crimes...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i hereby promote you to the rank of lieutenant commander, with all the rights and privileges thereto. and may god have mercy on your soul.}
<A>__{everyone roars in approval. picard smiles at worf and shakes his hand.}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(cont'd)}
<D>__{congratulations, commander.}
<C>__{worf}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{thank you, sir.}
<A>__{picard continues to smile at him for a moment...then riker steps in.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{extend the plank!!}
<A>__{worf's face registers surprise as everyone grabs him and hauls him toward the side, where a long plank is being pushed out over the water.}
<C>__{crewmembers}
<D>__{into the sea with him... feed him to the sharks... walk the plank... etc.}
<A>__{picard gives riker a questioning look.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{don't you think you're taking this a little too far, number one?}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{when we went to ancient rome for deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember?}
<A>__{picard shrugs it off... it's not exactly his cup of tea, but he'll go along with it. worf is hustled to the rail where beverly is waiting patiently by the plank, holding a long pike. worf is put on the plank and crusher prods him with the pike until worf is nearly at the end. worf finally stops and turns around.}
<C>__{worf}
<P>__{(a shout)}
<D>__{wait!!}
<A>__{everyone falls silent a moment. worf looks over the side at the water below.}
<C>__{worf}
<P>__{(a little embarrassed)}
<D>__{i can't swim.}
<C>__{la forge}
<P>__{(calmly, to worf)}
<D>__{the holodeck safety program is engaged... the computer won't let you drown.}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{but the sharks are quite convincing.}
<A>__{beverly prods him with the pike and worf falls into the sea with a huge splash . everyone laughs and cheers. reveal data, who is standing near the side rail, looking a little confused at the reaction.}
<C>__{data}
<P>__{(to beverly)}
<D>__{doctor, i must confess i am uncertain as to why pushing someone into freezing, shark infested water is amusing.}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{it's all done in good fun, data. get in the spirit of things.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{ah.}
<A>__{data thinks a moment, then he lifts beverly with one hand and hold her over the rail.}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{data...data !}
<A>__{data lets go and beverly plummets into the ocean. data looks around no one is laughing. they all look a little surprised.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{data. that wasn't funny.}
<A>__{data is puzzled by the reaction of the crowd... he's more confused than ever.}
<B>__{picard and riker}
<A>__{are standing on the quarterdeck as a very wet beverly comes up on deck.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{well, now that we're all aboard...}
<P>__{(beat, then smiles)}
<D>__{number one, bring the ship before the wind.}
<P>__{(savoring the moment)}
<D>__{let's see what's out there.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{aye, aye, sir.}
<P>__{(to troi)}
<D>__{take the wheel, commander.}
<A>__{troi takes the ship's wheel.}
<C>__{riker}
<P>__{(shouts)}
<D>__{all hands make sail! raise up tacks and stand by the braces!}
<A>__{the crew springs into action... rushing to their places aloft and on deck... grabbing ropes and lines... starting to unfurl the sails... trimming the yardarms... getting the ship ready to sail.}
