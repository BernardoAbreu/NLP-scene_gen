<L>__{interior outlying building hallway right after}
<A>__{just as carrie and delfy leave the lounge, her perifocal vision picks up a wisp of light from a flashlight, which bled out from a door's threshold halfway down the hall. delfy's eyes go wide carrie's finger goes to her mouth shhhhh. she instinctively pulls her baton with her left hand, but it hurts. she shifts it to the other. she turns off her light. delphy does the same. motions for him to stay put. she heads to the source, keeping her baton ready and her back tight to the wall. gets to the edge of the door. it's open just slightly looks in. sees a man in an ecw jacket with his back to her, holding a flashlight in one hand and digging through a duffle bag with his other. items are strewn. another bag has been completely turned inside out. she enters. baton cocked.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{unless you want your head cracked, i wouldn't move.}
<A>__{his body tenses.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{take it easy.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{ let me see your hands.}
<A>__{he slowly raises them.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{now turn around.}
<A>__{he does. he's a guy in his 30's. although he's clean shaven, there's a rugged edge about him.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{who are you?}
<A>__{delfy comes up behind her.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{robert pryce. i'm a united nations observer for the oceanic and antarctic section. if you relax, i've got my id.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{let's see it slowly.}
<A>__{as he reaches into his liner }
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{you must be stetko }
<A>__{this throws her.}
<C>__{pryce }
<D>__{i was heading to asb to talk to you about weiss when i was told you had come up here.}
<A>__{he holds out his id for her. as she reads }
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{how do you know about weiss?}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{fbi notified us. your base commander called it in.}
<A>__{carrie lowers her baton. he stands.}
<C>__{pryce }
<D>__{i thought i might find answers in his gear, but there's nothing here but clothes.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{this is part of a crime scene.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{i realize that, but considering the time constraints we're up against, let's be honest, taping and bagging everything isn't going to be an option.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{i will be sure to let the u.n. know if i find out anything.}
<A>__{she starts to walk away he follows, he's not done at all. delfy brings up the rear.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{you heading out to delta one one?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{maybe.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{i will grab my bag.}
<A>__{she stops.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{don't take this personally, but i don't need your help.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{if they've been digging out there, that's a direct violation of the united nations treaty. we think they were digging. that makes it my business.}
<A>__{this stops her digging?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{you don't dig for meteorites.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{and you don't get killed for them either. this is now a u.n. matter. i am within my rights to commandeer your pilot and plane if i have to.}
<C>__{delfy}
<D>__{he can, you know.}
<A>__{she knows and her patience is running thin.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{fine. but this is my investigation, understand? if you obstruct it in any way, i will have you detained.}
<A>__{she continues with pryce next to her.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{fine.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{mind if i ask you a personal question?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{no, but i have the feeling you're going to anyway.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{why do you smell like suntan lotion?}
