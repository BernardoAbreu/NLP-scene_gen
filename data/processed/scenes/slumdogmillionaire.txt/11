<L>__{exterior cricket ground. day.}
<A>__{bright sunlight filtered through the ever present mumbai dust. a group of children are playing cricket on a tarmac cricket ground. they are bare foot, dressed in little more than rags, wiry skinny and fast on their feet. salim, a nine year old, polishes the ball on his almost non existent shorts, comes in with surprising speed and bowls. the batsman hooks it high in the air. the bowler screams at a boy in the outfield.}
<C>__{salim}
<D>__{jamal! catch it! catch it!}
<A>__{the seven year old jamal stares up at the ball, jinks around trying to get into position. he pays no heed to the rest of the children who are scattering fast to the edges of the tarmac. the ball seems suspended in the blue sky. shouts from the other children seem very far away. he doesn't notice that they are screaming for him to get out of the way. jamal adjusts his feet for the perfect catch. then out of nowhere, a light aircraft almost takes his head off as it comes in to land on the tarmac runway. jamal is knocked to his feet by the down draft of the plane. the ball bounces away. also flattened, salim gets to his feet.}
<C>__{salim }
<D>__{how could you drop that? it was a sitter.}
<A>__{then salim's face turns to one of alarm.}
