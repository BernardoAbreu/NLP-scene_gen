<D>__{i'm sorry, maria. i have to talk to you.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{you seem to be doing all your talking to the newspapers these days.}
<C>__{sherman}
<D>__{believe me, i had nothing to do with that. we didn't want your name in the papers any more than you did.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{i see. well, here we are, sherman. the couple that all new york is talking about. and we're not even a couple anymore.}
<C>__{sherman}
<D>__{i thought you'd run out on me. i didn't even know where you went. and i was left sort of holding the bag, trying to protect you.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{oh, sherman. would i do that to you? sherman, sherman, sherman.}
<A>__{she embraces him, her hands moving toward the hidden recorder. sherman takes both her hands and pulls them to his chest.}

<D>__{you have to help me, maria.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{but how can i help you?}
<C>__{sherman}
<D>__{well, i know this may sound like a strange request, but you could start by telling the police what really happened.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{oh, sherman, you are the sweetest thing. but i'm not sure anybody knows what really happened. not anymore. and if anybody does know, it certainly isn't me.}
<C>__{sherman}
<D>__{but you were driving the car that night.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{was i? i don't remember. isn't it funny how a little thing like that can slip your mind?}
<P>__{(she kisses him)}
