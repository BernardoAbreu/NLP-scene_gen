<L>__{interior hall of the round table night}
<A>__{the din of the petitioners is replaced by music. it is the hour of the evening feast, and all knights are present, except lancelot. whole tree trunks burn in the great fireplace, and lambs roast on spits in the flames. pages run to and fro with trays of food and wine, perceval among them. morgana stops beside merlin.}
<C>__{morgana}
<D>__{what did i see today in the wizard's eyes? censure, because i enjoy a few words with a young handsome knight?}
<A>__{merlin is in agony, a bug stuck on a pin.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{no, no, of course not. you are young...}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{i'm not jealous!}
<C>__{morgana}
<D>__{it's clear you are, and it irks me.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{no. yes, i am. i am jealous. i want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name...}
<C>__{morgana}
<D>__{a lovestruck page!}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{shh... yes, yes. sit with me, please... morgana.}
<A>__{she does, laughing and in complete control. his hand immediately slides onto her thigh. she removes it, but holds it in her hand, toying with his fingers.}
<C>__{morgana}
<D>__{a steamy, panting, lovestruck page. but what good are songs and poems to me? they are the barter of ordinary love. a gift that reflected your greatness is the only one worthy of your love.}
<A>__{merlin looks at her, knowing already, sad yet eager.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{i showed you all my conjuring tricks...}
<C>__{morgana}
<D>__{the deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{maybe... maybe...}
<A>__{merlin's thoughts have carried him far away, when he realizes that arthur is addressing him.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{merlin, are you counselor to the king, or to my sister?}
<A>__{some knights laugh.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{at your service, sir.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{then answer me this. for years peace has reigned in the land. crops grow in abundance, there is no want. every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. tell me, merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{good and evil; there is never one without the other.}
<A>__{arthur is taken aback.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{never where you expect it, that's all i know.}
<A>__{he chuckles softly and arthur is puzzled. a knight speaks out, the young knight with whom morgana was flirting. his manner is sarcastic.}
<C>__{sir gahalt}
<D>__{if we have peace and justice, why is lancelot never with us? why is he always riding out on his quests? he must know where this evil is.}
<C>__{sir gawain}
<D>__{could there be evil within lancelot himself? to live above human folly, as is his aim, is to be overly proud.}
<C>__{sir gahalt}
<D>__{he pays no heed even to the queens longing for his company.}
<A>__{the hall falls silent, all eyes upon the queen.}
<C>__{guenevere}
<P>__{(lashing out)}
<D>__{what is it you would have your words mean, sir gahalt?}
<A>__{frightened, gahalt doesn't answer. morgana has slipped to guenevere's side.}
<C>__{morgana}
<D>__{don't listen to him. you are the queen.}
<A>__{arthur, ashen faced, turns to merlin for help, but he has escaped into sleep...}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{sir gahalt, answer the queen.}
<C>__{guenevere}
<D>__{no. i meant not to be angry with you, sir gahalt. in the idleness that comes with peace gossip has bread its own evil. you merely repeat it. please, sir, have one of those apples that lancelot loves, and in that gesture partake of its goodness.}
<A>__{morgana picks the bowl up and as she does so, unseen by any and with a magician's dexterity, she thrusts her fingernails deep into the top apple. she gives the bowl to guenevere, who takes it and sweeps around to where sir gahalt sits, followed by morgana. the young knight jumps to his feet.}
<C>__{guenevere}
<D>__{take one, sir gahalt.}
<C>__{sir gahalt}
<D>__{i am most honored, my lady.}
<A>__{he is too shy to take the shiniest, most beautiful apple on top, and goes for another one. morgana giggles, and he looks at her. she looks at the apple on top and then smiles encouragingly at him. sir gahalt takes it and starts eating as the queen returns to her seat. with the third bite his is unable to breathe. his face goes red and he rises to his feet, attempting to call out. he falls, dying immediately. all leap to their feet, and arthur rushes to the young knight. merlin is asleep and far from human affairs. arthur and sir gawain rise from the body of the young knight. sir gawain backs away from arthur and points at guenevere, trembling with cold rage.}
<C>__{sir gawain}
<D>__{hear me, lord arthur, and knights and chieftains: i charge guenevere with the murder of my brother.}
<A>__{guenevere, white and with a broken voice, turns to arthur.}
<C>__{guenevere}
<D>__{i didn't... i am innocent.}
<A>__{she begins to swoon and morgana keeps her steady on her feet. arthur slumps into his seat and sir gawain kneels before him.}
<C>__{sir gawain}
<D>__{i champion this truth: that queen guenevere murdered sir gahalt with the aid of sorcery.}
<A>__{enraged, arthur reaches for excalibur. but with effort he checks his impulse.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{the queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf.}
<C>__{guenevere}
<D>__{not you, my husband?}
<A>__{arthur cannot look at her.}
<C>__{sir gawain}
<D>__{she must be burnt at the stake. that is the sentence for murder done with magic.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{it is. lords and knights of the round table, as her husband i say that this deed was not done by guenevere. who among you will champion this truth?}
<A>__{no one responds. guenevere falls into her seat. arthur searches the eyes of his knights and they evade him.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{sir caradoc! you!}
<A>__{the knight looks up.}
<C>__{caradoc}
<D>__{i am torn.}
<A>__{sir ector, old and feeble, weeps for arthur. someone speaks up. it is perceval, who kneels before the queen. his voice is unnaturally loud, and his eyes shine with held back tears; he stutters.}
<C>__{perceval}
<D>__{i will champion you, my lady.}
<A>__{he is overwhelmed by his own boldness. he looks around. all eyes are upon him. guenevere smiles at him, sadly.}
<C>__{guenevere}
<D>__{i thank you, but you are not yet a knight.}
<C>__{perceval}
<D>__{i will find lancelot! he will come!}
<A>__{perceval hurries from the hall. arthur looks away, ashamed, and his eyes fall on merlin, twitching and mumbling in his sleep.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{boys!... boys will be boys...}
