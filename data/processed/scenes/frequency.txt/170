<A>__{frank looks up to see shepard, who quickly closes the door behind him... and unholsters his gun. an eerie moment.}
<C>__{shepard}
<D>__{on your feet.}
<A>__{frank waits a beat. then very slowly, he stands.}
<C>__{shepard }
<D>__{now turn around, face the wall.}
<A>__{frank steps back, slowly turning. shepard holsters the gun. kicks frank up against the wall as he reaches into his pocket and takes out the leather garrote we saw in the peppermint lounge bathroom. he coils it around his hands.}
<C>__{shepard }
<D>__{how did you know?}
<A>__{frank is trembling.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(facing the wall)}
<D>__{you twisted animal...}
<C>__{shepard}
<D>__{evidence says you're the animal.}
<P>__{(snapping garrote tight)}
<D>__{that's why you hung yourself.}
<A>__{but frank turns.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you try putting that thing around my neck and i will rip your throat out. you want me dead, use the gun.}
<A>__{shepard smiles, unfazed...}
<C>__{shepard}
<D>__{let me draw you a picture. you live at 1060 41st ave. you have a wife who works at new york hospital. and a six year old at p.s. 130.}
<A>__{shepard gives frank a look that would make a marine drill sergeant shit his pants. shepard knows frank's weakness, the one thing that would make him submit to death. closing his eyes, frank turns to face the wall...but the door handle rattles, someone is outside coming in. shepard quickly yanks frank away from the wall, shoving him in a chair at the interrogation table. the door opens.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{what the hell is going on here?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you got to help me. he's trying to kill me.}
<A>__{shepard just laughs. phil scans the room everything looks normal, a cop questioning a perp.}
<C>__{shepard}
<D>__{mind if we take it outside?}
<A>__{phil shrugs okay.}
<C>__{shepard }
<P>__{(to frank)}
<D>__{i will be right back.}
<A>__{shepard and phil step out bolting the door behind them.}
