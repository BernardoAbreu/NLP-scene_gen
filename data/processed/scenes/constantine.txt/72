<L>__{exterior holy cross cemetery}
<A>__{they make it through the gate, pass through an alley of overhanging trees. something ripples through the branches flitters right past angela's face. she swats at it, manages to get a branch across the cheek. they near the good shepherd and the floodlights flicker, fade out. statues of saints become dark monoliths. john stops in an open area between trees and a mausoleum. a lit cross on the wall provides the only illumination. angela feels the scratch on her cheek, sees a trickle of blood. now she hears sounds in the darkness. like leather rubbing. surrounding them.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{what is that?}
<A>__{john is just as surprised he's saying this }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{wings.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{wings?}
<A>__{john rummages through his trench coat fishes out that cloth beeman gave him. the one supposedly wrapped around moses.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{and maybe talons.}
<A>__{the cross is getting dimmer and dimmer...}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{are you kidding? of what?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{something that's not supposed to be here.}
<A>__{john quickly wraps the cloth tight around his hand. angela spins, eyes seeing only darkness as the sounds get closer ghastly sound of movement in the fringes of light. the cross now resembles a dying wire filament and with every second the circle of light gets smaller and those sounds get closer. john takes out his special lighter.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{close your eyes.}
<A>__{they are now standing in pitch darkness.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{suit yourself.}
<A>__{john flicks the lighter and in one powerful motion sweeps his arm up as he lights his hand. sacred cloth catches fire then ignites with a brilliant retina searing flash blinding angela and illuminating a circle of winged demons a roiling broth of reptilian death right there ready to pounce. red flame radiates from the cloth and demons shriek as they are instantly vaporized. john tucks his burning hand into a coat pocket, extinguishes the flame. he leans down to a rubbery stain left from one of the burnt demon carcasses. shakes his head in disbelief.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{'i accidentally crossed over?' i don't think so.}
<C>__{angela}
<P>__{(coming up behind)}
<D>__{what was that? i saw wings and teeth they were flying. what the hell were those things?!}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{they weren't angels.}
<A>__{john scans the area, trying to think this through.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{seplavites, actually. scavengers for the damned.}
<P>__{(off her lost look)}
<D>__{demons?}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{what? you can't be serious... this is impossible...}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{yeah...}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{and i don't think they were after me...}
<A>__{john looks at her with renewed interest.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you really believe she wouldn't commit suicide?}
<C>__{angela}
<P>__{(a bit thrown)}
<D>__{my sister?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{never in a million years.}
<A>__{john makes the decision.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{let's be sure.}
<A>__{he starts walking. angela is now compelled to follow.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{simple. see if she's in hell.}
