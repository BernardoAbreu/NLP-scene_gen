<A>__{carts, rumbling in panic down a road as civilians flee the walled city in the distance.}
<B>__{the scottish army}
<A>__{has cut a huge tree and placed it on wheels. it rumbles ominously toward camera... the civilian panic continues as more people join the swell of those leaving york. the scottish army keeps coming on. inside the walls of the city day the governor is furious and confused.}
<C>__{governor}
<D>__{we will not allow a bandit to panic the greatest city in northern england! close off the escapes! let no one leave!}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{the city has emptied already, sire. only the scottish civilians remain.}
<A>__{the governor turns to his captain with a look worthy of his uncle, longshanks the king.}
<B>__{on the battering ram}
<A>__{as it picks up speed and slams into the wooden gate of the city. with the collision, the battle is on. it's a night battle: torches, flaming arrows, pots of boiling oil being splashed down at the attackers, who swarm the gate. the oil beats the first wave of scots back, but wallace rushes forward, grabbing the ram cart with his own hands; the attackers rally to him, helping him slam the gate again and again. it breaks; but behind it is an awful tangle of carts, broken sheds, impenetrable rubbish. wallace grabs a torch, throws it into the wooden tangle, and shouts }

<D>__{back! wait for it to burn!}

<C>__{governor}
<D>__{then do as i ordered.}
<B>__{outside the walls}
<A>__{the scots wait, biding their time as the barrier burns. suddenly they look up in horror; the english are throwing the bodies of hanged scots over the wall. they stare at this in mute shock. wallace is frozen, his eyes reflecting his boyhood reaction. his men rush forward.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{stop! not yet! listen to me!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{they wish to frighten us! or goad us into attacking too soon! don't look away! look!}
<A>__{the scots look at the hanging bodies.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{behold the enemy we fight! we will be more merciful than they have been. we will spare women, children, and priests. for all else, no mercy.}
<A>__{wallace draws his broadsword. the burning debris inside the gate collapses, leaving a tunnel through the fire. wallace screams, and leads the charge through the burning barrier.}
