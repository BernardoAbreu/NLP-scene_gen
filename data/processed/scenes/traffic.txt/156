<L>__{interior barbara's car night}
<A>__{barbara drives robert home from the airport. there's a sense they've been silent for a while.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{i think we may have found our mexican drug czar. it's this general, salazar. at least i will have somebody on the other side i can talk to.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{does this mean you're going to be gone more?}
<A>__{a long silence.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{possibly.}
<A>__{another silence.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{you might want to pencil in a little face time with your daughter.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{barbara }
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{because i'm at the edge of my capabilities, robert.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{the first thing we have to do is present a unified front.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{if you start in on the war metaphors i'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{look, i'm as worried as you are }
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{no, i don't think so. leave me alone, give me money. that's what i get from our daughter. she has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{yeah, well, she has a way of self medicating that probably seems familiar, too.}
<A>__{she looks at him, stung.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{i'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{i have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day. that's different.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{oh, it is?}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.}
