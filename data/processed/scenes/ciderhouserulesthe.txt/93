<L>__{exterior cider house, roof night}
<C>__{rose rose }
<D>__{where's that homer?}
<A>__{homer stands in front of a ladder that leans against the cider house; he starts to climb up, drawn by the murmuring voices, the soft laughter.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{who cares?}
<C>__{mr. rose }
<D>__{now, now. he's a good boy.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{shit. we don't know what he is.}
<C>__{mr. rose }
<D>__{jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.}
<A>__{homer arrives at the top and sees everyone sitting on a long plank, a bench attached to the apex of the roof obviously a popular spot.}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<D>__{here he is.}
<A>__{no one moves.}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<D>__{where's your manners? make room for homer, so's he can enjoy the view.}
<C>__{muddy}
<D>__{what view?}
<A>__{peaches slides over and homer sits down.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{are we supposed to be up here? the rules said...}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<D>__{homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.}
<A>__{the others laugh.}
<C>__{muddy}
<D>__{what view?}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<D>__{well, muddy, we can look at all these angry stars homer's been readin' to us about.}
<A>__{more laughter; homer smiles, enjoying the teasing.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(gesturing toward the worthington farmhouse)}
<D>__{i bet the view looks better from the worthin'tons'.}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<D>__{you think so, jack? well... i wouldn't want to be in that wally's shoes tonight.}
<C>__{rose rose}
<P>__{(playfully, teasing him)}
<D>__{daddy, i'd like to be in that wally's shoes every night.}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<P>__{(teasing her back)}
<D>__{you lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...}
<C>__{rose rose}
<D>__{what's lucky about that?}
<A>__{rose rose is being physically affectionate with her father lightly punching his arm, rubbing the top of his head.}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<D>__{you know where that wally is tonight, darlin'? he's up there in them angry stars.}
<P>__{(gesturing at the dark sky)}
<D>__{he's flyin' all around up there... with them japs shooting at him.}
<A>__{they all look up, imagining that. homer more than the others. rose rose, looking thoughtful, rests her head on her father's shoulder. they are completely natural together.}
