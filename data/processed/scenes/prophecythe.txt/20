<L>__{exterior hill day}
<A>__{with the brick schoolhouse tiny in the background, katherine's class trudges its way up the barren, rocky hillside behind the town. the teenage rancher's kids try to make time with the mexican girls one of the little boys has gotten into a shoving match with a little girl.}
<C>__{katherine}
<P>__{(coming between them)}
<D>__{ hey. come on. what's the deal, brian?}
<A>__{the girl folds her arms defiantly. the boy is pissed, embarrassed.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{she...}

<D>__{cow demon?}
<B>__{up on the hill}
<A>__{katherine's given the geiger counter to the little navaho girl, mary. focusing grimly on the rock in front of her, mary guides the detector over the stones till suddenly it begins clicking softly.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i got one! i got one!}
<A>__{the high school kids come up and help dig.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{easy... easy... don't break it.}
<A>__{almost immediately, an eye socket appears in the dust. as the students carefully brush away the dust, katherine looks back across the crumbly path. a coyote has crept up onto a near ledge. it just stands there. watching her.}
