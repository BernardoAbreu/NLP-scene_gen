<A>__{various shots; the creatures of isla sorna walk past in the shadows, some looking up at the light in the trees. suddenly, one of the creatures is attacked by another. we hear rolling, snarling, hissing, just seeing the outline of the fight. just as fast as it began, the fight is over, the winner snakes on the loser.}
