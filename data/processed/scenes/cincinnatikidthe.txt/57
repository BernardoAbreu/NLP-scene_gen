<A>__{melba in her bra and panties, snuggles against the kid.}

<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{he'll understand.}

<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{tell him they decided to play a little longer, and i will call him at his place later when the game's over... right. goodbye, honey.}
<A>__{he hangs up the phone and emerges from the booth. camera moves with him as he joins felix and they walk toward the hotel entrance.}
<L>__{interior shooter's apartment melba and the kid}
<A>__{the kid, his policy toward this new situation still unresolved, holds her lightly while he tries to think it out aloud.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{listen, melba }
<C>__{melba}
<D>__{i have to tell you first. you're sitting down with lancey next monday night.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{i wish it was sooner. i wish it was tomorrow.}
<C>__{melba}
<D>__{shooter'll give you all the details later.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{i don't like waiting that long.}
<C>__{melba}
<D>__{let's not kick a gift horse in the teeth, sugar. we've got this time together. let's try to "fill each unforgiving minute with sixty seconds worth of distance run."}
<A>__{she invites a kiss and he obliges her. but there is a contrary force at work inside him.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{listen, what i was going to say before, i don't want you to think i'm being some kind of jerk or i don't feel you'd be great to sack up with.}
<C>__{melba}
<D>__{then let's cut the filibuster.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{i've made dolls that were friends of mine's wives. i figured if they were willing, they were doing it to their husbands, i wasn't.}
<C>__{melba}
<D>__{of course. any other attitude, you're degrading the woman. you're not treating her as a person with a mind of her own, but as somebody's property.}
<A>__{again she presses close to him and again he savors her for a moment.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{only thing is, it's different with the shooter than anybody else. he's so straight, i got the obligation to be straighter with him than other people. so do you. on account of we both owe him plenty.}
<C>__{melba}
<D>__{i thought we just agreed that what you and i did was strictly between us.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{can't be.}
<P>__{(decisively, pulling}
<D>__{away from her with a}
<P>__{pat of dismissal)}
<D>__{shooter's the closest thing to family i got. it's almost like he was my old man. don't you see how that's got a bearing on us?}
<A>__{he starts out. melba stares after him, scarcely able to believe what is being done to her.}
<C>__{melba}
<D>__{sure, it means i'm your mother.}
