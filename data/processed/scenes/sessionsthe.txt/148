<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{that was quite something. what do you propose to do for an encore?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yep, i almost found out the big secret. but here i am, back with the living. if there is another place, then i think they took one look at me and decided to throw me back.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{and welcome back.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{and thank you for coming to visit.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{i know it's been awhile since we talked about this... about cheryl. at the time, you seemed to feel so badly about her... or about it?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i no longer feel like that.}
<A>__{father brendan is rather taken by surprise.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{oh? that's good to hear. in the end, you're glad that you did it?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yes, i am. in fact, at this point in time, i feel very blessed.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{blessed?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yes, blessed. they put me on this new anti depressant and now i can really see life from the cup half full rather than cup half empty point of view.}
<A>__{father brendan looks truly amazed.}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{it takes about six weeks to kick in, but when it does, you can really tell the difference.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{hey, that's great.}
<A>__{mark grins.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'm pulling your leg, father. i'm not on drugs. i have a girlfriend.}

<C>__{mark}
<D>__{a very real girlfriend. she adores me. she'll do anything for me. and i can get pretty kinky sometimes, believe you me. her name is susan.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{i'm flabbergasted. is she pretty?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{she sure is.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{has she got a sister?}

<A>__{father brendan smiles and shakes his head.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{here i was, all prepared to offer comfort to the forlorn that's supposed to be my specialty and now i can just throw away that little speech.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{no, no. please make the little speech. i'd love to hear it.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{okay, but i will try and keep it short.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{don't make it too short.}
<C>__{father brendan}
<D>__{okay, fine. here goes. the meaning of love. love is a journey.}
