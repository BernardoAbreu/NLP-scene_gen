<A>__{lenny wakes up to the sound of the phone ringing. he is on the couch, still clothed. he hears max's voice on the answer machine and groggily grabs the receiver.}

<A>__{max, on the cellular, across the street from a church where mourners stream out of a memorial for jeriko one. the sidewalk and street are clogged with fans, and further off a cordon of very anxious looking crowd control cops.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{not a whole hell of a lot. they've just been saying words over jeriko. tensions running pretty high down here. i'm telling you.}
<A>__{what max sees across the street... slowmo as tran comes out of the church with faith next to him. corto, vita, duncan and beemer form a loose protective shell around them as the press bears down, shouting out questions. tran ushers faith into a waiting limo and climbs in after her. the rest of the muscle keeps the press away from the car as it pulls away.}
