<A>__{lilly looks up and sees two hands straining to hold caesar above the quickly narrowing gap. in a courageous move, lilly grabs the little dog before he gets crushed and together they fall to the ground. back on the other side of the chamber door, tamara looks around. she is trapped now as the water continues to rush in.}

<A>__{back under water, jackson is using the extension cord of the power drill to pull himself down to the tool cabinet. jackson opens it, retrieving a giant crowbar. he begins to use it to dislodge the tool but it's hard work.}

<D>__{noah!}
<L>__{interior hydraulic chamber american ship day}
<A>__{jackson pulls with all his might, but he can't quite shift the drill. to his surprise, a pair of young hands join his on the handle of the crowbar. noah is alongside him now, helping. working as father and son, they manage, little by little, to loosen it before finally the drill comes free. adrian gives noah the thumbs up and the boy heads back to the surface. jackson goes to follow but in the last moment he spots the knapsack containing his laptop. he dives back down for it.}
