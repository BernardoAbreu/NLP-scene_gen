<L>__{int santa maria del popolo dusk}
<A>__{ and the heavy door clunks open. the interior of the church is an obstacle course of torn up flooring, brick pallets, mounds of dirt. silt drifts in the dying sunlight that shines through the broken windows and walls. nothing moves. dead silence. langdon and vittoria walk slowly to the middle of the floor, at one end of the chapel. there are eight recesses, four on either side of a central aisle, all covered with large sheets of plastic, to protect them during construction.}
<C>__{langdon}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{the chapel is in one of those apses.}
<A>__{the plastic rustles ominously. anything could be behind any one of them. vittoria pulls the gun from her waistband and holds it in front of her. langdon notices, it makes him uncomfortable.}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{you have to give that back.}
<A>__{she looks at him what are you, nuts? something rushes at them from the side, she whirls and nearly blows olivetti to kingdom come as he and vincenzo barrel in through the side door. langdon gestures everybody quiet. olivetti points to the left gestures to langdon and vittoria to go to the right. they separate, to either side of the main aisle. at the first chapel, langdon pulls the plastic aside, eyes scan the chapel. nothing. on the other side, olivetti does the same, at another chapel. nothing. at the third chapel, vittoria pushes the plastic aside, gun in front of her. there's a sudden movement to her left, she whirls and a rat scurries away. at the fourth chapel, langdon pushes the plastic aside, steps inside and gasps. moving behind him, we see a christian chapel like no other we've ever seen. finished entirely in chestnut marble, overhead it has a domed cupola with a field of illuminated stars and the seven planets (as known in galileo's day). further down the wall, there are tributes to earth's four seasons but most incredible of all are the two huge structures that dominate the room from either side. pyramids. ten feet high. vittoria steps in behind him.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{pyramids. in a catholic church. this is it.}
<A>__{behind them, the plastic rustles, as if drawn by a wind, and as langdon turns, he hears, faintly, a door closing far away. he turns back, eyes drawn to the floor. there is a large oval medallion there, with a skeleton carved into it. it's slightly off center, raised. as if it's been opened recently, and hurriedly replaced.}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{the demon's hole.}
<A>__{in the demon's hole, we're looking up now as the medallion grinds to the side. faces peer down at us langdon, vittoria, olivetti, and vincenzo. they recoil from a stench. up top, langdon squints, trying to see inside.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{anybody got a flashlight?}
<A>__{vincenzo hands him one. langdon shines it down into the crypt. there are shapes, but thirty feet down and hard to make out. there's one in particular, in the darkness, seems too short to be a person, but it's moving slightly.}
<C>__{olivetti}
<D>__{can you tell what it is?}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{not from up here.}
<A>__{he reaches down, rattles the ladder that leans against the wall of the crypt. takes a deep breath, looks at the others.}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{those guns. keep 'em handy?}
<A>__{in the demon's hole, langdon reaches the bottom, still shining the light at the figure in the distance. it's brighter here, he can see it's flesh colored, but still indistinct. he takes a step toward it and something crunches under his feet. he shines the light down. he's standing on a pile of human skulls}
<C>__{olivetti}
<P>__{(calling down)}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{more or less.}
<A>__{he takes two more steps, closer to the swaying figure on the other side of the crypt. he can now clearly see a man's naked back.}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{he's here! i think he's sitting.}
<P>__{(moves closer)}
<D>__{hello?}
<P>__{(closer still)}
<D>__{are you all right?}
<A>__{it's a human figure. as langdon draws close, he sees the source of the movement rats, gnawing at the dead body. they scurry away as langdon comes around the front, and we pull back to see what he sees. it's cardinal lamasse. he's been buried in the earthen floor of the crypt up to his waist his jaw broken, his mouth crammed full of dirt. but that's not the worst of it. langdon gags as he sees the blackened word that has been branded into the red flesh of the cardinal's chest. it's an ambigram, like we've seen before, but this time it says }
<C>__{earth.}
