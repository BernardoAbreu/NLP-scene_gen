<L>__{interior bookies day}
<A>__{inside is the man with the case, busy filling in a slip, and two clerks behind the betting counter. vinny doesn't mince around and goes straight to the counter, where the head clerk pauline, comes up to help.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{yes sir, how can i help?}
<C>__{vinny}
<D>__{you can start by giving me all your money.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{does sir know who this bookies belongs to?}
<C>__{vinny}
<D>__{it. belongs to me now.}
<A>__{vinny then leans over the counter to get menacing. pauline looks more than a little concerned}
<C>__{vinny }
<D>__{if you know what's good for...}
<A>__{he is cut short, as pauline triggers a button under the counter and a security screen comes flying up at a very rapid rate of knots protecting all the counters. this has the unfortunate consequence of taking vinny with it. poor vin is shot straight to the ceiling, all we can see is half a body and his desperately searching for ground legs. needless to say this leaves sol in a bit of a bewildered state. he's looking the wrong way at the critical moment and is left wondering what happened, not having seen vince impaled on the ceiling. sol extracts the enormous shotgun.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{vi nce ? vince??}
<A>__{he spins round looking for his colleague. a muffled noise tells him to look up. ,}
<C>__{sol }
<D>__{what are you doing vince? and what the fuck are you doing up there?}
<A>__{a few groans emanate from the other side of the counter. sol panics some more, and decides that emergency action is called for.}
<C>__{sol }
<D>__{i have got your man out here. if you don't put down the screen i will blow his fucking head off! you hear me?}
<C>__{pauline }
<D>__{i don't care, you can do what you like he's not related to me.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{you think you can try me?}
<A>__{sol raises the gun and fires into the side .of the wall. there's an enormous explosion and a clear hole is made in the side of the wall. the powerful kick from the gun also makes sol momentarily airborne.}
