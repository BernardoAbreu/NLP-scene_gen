<B>__{catherine martin}
<A>__{looks up at him. she is standing on the cement bottom of the pit, or oubliette, about 15 feet below floor level. the pit is bare, except for a futon and a plastic toilet bucket, from which a thin string rises up to the basement. she's soaking wet, in an orange jumpsuit, and holds a squeeze bottle of skin lotion. she struggles to sound calm.}

<D>__{put the bottle in the basket. no funny business, or you'll be sorry...}
<A>__{new angle catherine as the basket stops, and she steadies it. but as she slips the bottle in, she sees something, o.s., just at the fringe of the light. she hesitates, looks closer... then begins to scream, hysterically, again and again. her outflung hand hits the lamp, and in its swaying glare, we see high on the concrete walls, all around her }
<B>__{bloody finger tracks}
<A>__{dried now, brownish left by many pairs of frenzied hands...}
