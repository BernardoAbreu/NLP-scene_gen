<L>__{exterior countryside night}
<A>__{a moonlit horizon. unmoving. silent. the kind of silence that pulls at the darkest recesses of imagination. and now, a lone figure appears on the horizon. it's zowie, moving at a deliberate pace.}
<B>__{atop a knoll}
<A>__{zowie takes pause. the tinkling of his collar tags resumes as he drops over the horizon line, cutting down the hill.}
<L>__{interior chase's house night}
<A>__{chase sits in the den, looking exhausted and disheveled. in front of him, the t.v. is on. renee's face stares out at us. chase hits the remote and rises, moving to the back door. he checks the deadbolt, then secures the chain link as a backup. from somewhere outside, we hear a dog howl. chase's eyes drop to the doggy door, a holdover from the previous owner. chase bends down and latches the door. now he pauses at his desk... considers... then pulls something out of the bottom drawer. it's a gun.}
