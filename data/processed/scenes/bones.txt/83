<L>__{exterior pearl's storefront night}
<A>__{from outside, through the open window, we can hear the strains of singing coming from her window.}
<L>__{interior pearl's parlor continuous}
<A>__{we float around the members of pearl's circle. see objects on the table flickering in the candlelight.}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{the spirit world is all around us right this minute. and the departed are pressing in around us.}
<A>__{still singing, they all glance about them in darkness as if they can make out the spirits around them. over the low bass of their hymn singing, her voice cuts in. uncoiling and rising like smoke in the air: it's a beautiful voice and it does seem to open a window in the air.}
