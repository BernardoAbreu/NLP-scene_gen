<A>__{jezzie carries the garbage to an incinerator room down the hall. she is carrying several bags. two of them are tossed instantly down the chute. she hesitates with the third. after a moment she reaches into it and pulls out a handful of photos. they are pictures of jacob and sarah. with cool deliberation she drops them down the chute. an apartment door slams shut. quickly she disposes of the pictures remaining in her hand. jacob opens the door to the tiny room as the bag filled with the memories of his life falls to the fire below.}

<A>__{jacob and jezzie, both wearing postal uniforms, head for the elevator. they are surprised that it has arrived promptly. jezzie reaches out and playfully sticks her tongue into jacob's ear. he pulls her into the elevator. they disappear, laughing, behind its closing doors.}
