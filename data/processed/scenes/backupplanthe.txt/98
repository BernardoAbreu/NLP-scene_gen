<L>__{interior zoe's bedroom later}
<A>__{the clock by the bed says 2:30 a.m. stan is snoring slightly. nuts is on the pillow beside him. zoe's side is empty.}
<L>__{interior zoe's living room continuous}
<A>__{zoe sits on the floor of the living room sifting through a box of photographs. we follow her back into the bedroom and onto the bed. as stan slowly opens his eyes, she holds up a photograph. his p.o.v. it's a picture of a woman's ass.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{this is my old ass.}
<A>__{stan blinks a few times. his eyes adjusting.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{why do you have a picture of your ass?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{my college boyfriend took it. so, i guess in fairness, my ass doesn't look exactly like this anymore, but it's pretty close. it's held up.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{it's a nice ass.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{you said you don't know the real me, so i thought i'd show you.}
<A>__{she picks up another photograph. this one is of zoe at twelve and at her most awkward short hair, braces and acne.}
<C>__{zoe }
<D>__{this is me in seventh grade.}
<A>__{stan props himself up in one elbow.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{wow.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{you look like anthony michael hall.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{this period, as horrible as it was, made me who i am. i think every person should go through a hideously ugly phase. it builds character.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{it also taught me that i should never, under any circumstances, have short hair and a perm again.}
<A>__{she picks up another picture. it's zoe in a bathing cap and speedo. she's holding up a yellow ribbon and has her arm around nana.}
<C>__{zoe }
<D>__{this is one of my favorites because look how happy i am. i don't even know what place yellow is, but i'm sure it's not good.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{fifth place.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{but i still look super happy, right? that's all because of nana. whatever i did, she thought it was the best.}
<A>__{the next picture is a halloween shot of bobby, mona and zoe. bobby is all in green, zoe is all in yellow and mona is in regular clothes.}
<C>__{zoe }
<D>__{these are my best friends, bobby and mona. mona and i met in high school and bobby passed out on my couch in college and never left. you haven't met them yet because they might scare you away.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{why are you dressed like that?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{halloween. we were supposed to be a traffic light but mona bagged out at the last minute and so bobby and i just look like idiots. that's typical mona, by the way.}
<A>__{zoe puts the picture down and picks up another. it's a woman in a hospital bed. she's giving the thumbs up sign.}
<C>__{zoe }
<D>__{this is my mom.}
<A>__{stan takes the picture and studies it.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{you look just like her.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{this is the last picture of her that i have. she lived for a few more years, but we never took any pictures because she didn't want us to remember her like that. i was eight when she died.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{i...can't imagine.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{she had a great laugh. and really soft hands. she used to rub my back before i went to sleep.}
<A>__{zoe puts the picture on the bedside table, propping it up next to her clock.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{do you have any pictures of your dad?}
<A>__{zoe doesn't say anything.}
<C>__{stan }
<D>__{i'm sorry. if you don't want to talk about it...}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{my mother was in a coma for two years before the end. that's when my dad left her.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{so...that's when he died. to us, anyway.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{god, zoe. i'm so sorry.}
<C>__{zoe}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{it's okay. it was an important lesson. that's when i realized that nothing lasts forever.}
<A>__{this sad statement hangs in the air for a few moments.}
<C>__{zoe }
<D>__{so, that's my story. that's the real me.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{things can last forever, you know.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{not for me they can't.}
<A>__{stan takes her hand, and they stay like that for a while. just holding hands on the floor of her moonlit room. finally, the silence is broken by the telephone ringing.}
<C>__{zoe }
<D>__{that's weird.}
