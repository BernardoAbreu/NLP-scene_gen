<L>__{exterior road day}
<A>__{eli and solara walk together, passing by a few burned out buildings. it appears we might be headed toward a town. solara looks up at the sweltering sun. then around at her surroundings. nothing but devastation and decay.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{you say you've been walking for twenty five years. have you ever considered that you might be lost?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{but how can you know? how can you know this is the right way?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i told you. my path has been laid out before me.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{yeah, but laid out by who?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{by almighty god.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{well if this god guy's so mighty, how come it's taking you so long to get where you're going? doesn't he know the way?}
<A>__{eli wheels around and jabs a scolding finger at her.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{you want to stay on this road with me, don't ever let me hear you take his name in vain like that again.}
<A>__{solara is surprised by the severity of his reaction.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{eli resumes walking.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{god has a reason for everything being the way it is. it's not always apparent to us. but it is his plan nonetheless.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{so, is he talking to you right now? telling you where to go?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it's not like that. it's kinda hard to explain. i'm guided by faith.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{i don't know what that word means.}
<A>__{beat as eli thinks on how to explain it.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it means you know something even though you don't know it.}
<A>__{solara thinks about this, shakes her head.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{that doesn't make any sense at all.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it doesn't have to.}
<A>__{they walk on.}
