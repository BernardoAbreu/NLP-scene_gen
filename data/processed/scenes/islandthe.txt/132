<A>__{a blue glass partition wall looks out onto the depot. more like a marina with an embarcadero a n d a row of docks. "liners" slot in and out, their nautical trim making them seem like ferries. lincoln and ester sit waiting. lincoln, rigid, watchful. ester, gazing across at the mexican woman, who as the infant cradled asleep. ester glances wistfully at lincoln. then she frowns }
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{lincoln , what is that? on your face?}
<A>__{lincoln turns, touching his face. he feels stubble there. for the first time. his body is naturalizing but it feels unnatural to him. ester reaches out and runs her fingers across his cheek. lincoln stiffens a little, unused to this type of contact. but her touch is gentle and the contact is warming. their eyes slowly meet, flickering, something passing between them. then ester's face contorts slightly. she emits a shallow cough.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{a r e you alright?}
<A>__{ester clears her throat. but another cough follows.}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{m y throat... it feels dry...}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{o k a y . . . i will get you some water.}
