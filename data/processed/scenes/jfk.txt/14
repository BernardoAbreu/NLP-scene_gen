<A>__{with jim's heart pounding as he reads. back in dealey plaza, s.m. holland, an elderly signal supervisor, stands on the parapet of the railway.}
<C>__{holland }
<D>__{four shots... a puff of smoke came from the trees... behind that picket fence... close to the little plaza there's no doubt whatever in my mind.}
<A>__{we see the scene from holland's point of view the puff of smoke lingering under the trees along the picket fence after the shooting. garrison bedroom another night(1966) jim is asleep, having a tortured dream. dreamscape flashback: we see the zapruder film, in slow motion and j.f.k.'s face just before he goes behind stemmons freeway sign. jim sits up suddenly.}

<D>__{no!}
<A>__{liz stirs, shaken.}

<D>__{honey, you all right?}

<C>__{jim}
<D>__{it's incredible, honey the whole thing. a lieutenant colonel testifies that lee oswald was given a russian language exam as part of his marine training only a few months before he defects to the soviet union. a russian exam!}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(sitting up, angered)}
<D>__{i cannot believe this. it's four thirty, jim garrison. i have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{honey, in all my years in the service i never knew a single man who was given a russian test. oswald was a radar operator. he'd have about as much use for russian as a cat has for pajamas.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{these books are getting to your mind, mr. garrison. i wish you'd stop readin' them.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{and then this colonel tries to make it sound like nothing. oswald did badly on the test, he says. "he only had two more russian words right than wrong." ha! that's like me saying touchdown here...}
<P>__{(points to the dog)}
<D>__{...is not very intelligent because i beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess.}

<D>__{jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake! you going to stay up all night every night? for what? so you'll be the only man in america who read the entire 26 volumes of the warren report?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{liz, do i have to spell it out for you? lee oswald was no ordinary soldier. that was no accident he was in russia. he was probably in military intelligence. that's why he was trained in russian.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(with a quizzical look)}
<D>__{honey, go back to sleep, please!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{goddammit! i been sleeping for three years!}

<A>__{lafayette square new orleans morning(1966) a sunday, early. we see a statue of ben franklin in an empty square frequented by drunks who doze on benches in a little leafy park in the center of the square. the camera moves to jim by himself and then moves to a sedan, pulling up, which disgorges lou ivon and bill broussard.}
