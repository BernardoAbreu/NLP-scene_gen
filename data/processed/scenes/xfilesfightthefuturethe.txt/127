<L>__{interior white dome tent night}
<A>__{mulder pulls open the steel door leading in. it opens with a sucking sound which suggests the interior is pressurized. and as he and scully step in they both jump when large fans just overhead hit them both with hard blasts of air. stepping quickly out of the downward blasting air, into the still silence of the space beyond.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{cool in here. temperature's being regulated.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{for the purpose of what?}
<B>__{high overhead angle}
<A>__{our view is down through the crosswires and cables that create the tension support. the effect is a combination of simplicity and perfect function. stark and high tech. the flooring is gray and flat, featureless. but we don't yet see from this angle exactly what the white domed tent houses. though the air is still and there is no movement of any kind, there is a sound that permeates the interior. a steady hum. almost electrical hum, but different. mulder and scully move together toward the middle of the space. wide on tent mulder and scully's pov laid out in a grid, low to the ground, are what look like boxes. fixed in place like roof vents, except these are on the floor, no more than three feet tall, and about the same measure square. new angle tracking with mulder and scully as they continue to move cautiously, walking out into the grid of box shaped objects. coming to the center of the capacious, arena sized space. standing over one of the mysterious boxes, which we now see have louvered tops. the louvers, however, are shut so that whatever is inside the boxes cannot be seen.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{i think we're on top of something. i think these are some kind of venting.}
<A>__{mulder lays his head and ear to the top of the box.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{you hear that?}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{i hear the humming. like electricity. high voltage maybe.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{maybe. maybe not.}
<A>__{scully looks skyward.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{what do you think those are for?}
<A>__{mulder takes his ear off the box, looking up now, too.}
<B>__{their pov}
<A>__{at the top of the dome are two large corresponding}
<B>__{louver vents. resume mulder and scully}
<A>__{looking up at these vents.}
