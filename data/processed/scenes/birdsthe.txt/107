<A>__{full shot the living room lydia is pouring coffee into cups. in the dining room, we can hear the chatter of the lovebirds. as lydia pours the sound distracts her. cathy is sorting candles at the couch. there is evidence of preparation everywhere: flashlights, kerosene lamps, a butane burner. mitch is at the fireplace putting more wood on the fire. melanie comes into the room and dumps another load.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{that's the last of it.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{did you close the door?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{and locked it.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{mitch, can i bring the lovebirds in here?}
<C>__{lydia}
<P>__{(snapping it)}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{mom, they're in a cage!}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{they're birds!}

<C>__{mitch}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{let them stay in the other room.}
<A>__{close shot lydia her hand trembling as she pours the coffee. full shot the room as they all sit and accept their coffee. the room is silent except for the crackle of the fire. mitch rises to put more wood on the fire. in the dining room, the lovebirds still are chattering wildly. their chirping is the only sound in the house.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{mitch? why are they doing this? the birds.}
<C>__{mitch}
<P>__{(putting wood on fire)}
<D>__{i don't know, honey.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{why are they trying to kill people?}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{i wish i could say. but if i could answer that, i could also tell you why people are trying to kill people.}
<A>__{the room is silent again except for the tweeting of the lovebirds offscreen. and then, suddenly, the lovebirds fall silent. close shot cathy turning to look toward the other room, her face going white, her eyes widening. close shot melanie waiting. close shot lydia waiting. close shot mitch waiting. full shot the room dead silent now. each of them is sitting on the edges of their chairs, waiting. there is the sudden sound of splintering glass.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{mitch...}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{shhh. shhh.}
<A>__{silence. into the silence, another pane of glass, shattering, the thud of a bird against the boards. silence. more panes of glass shattering. the sound of birds striking the boards and the outside of the house begins building, almost like muffled drumbeats. thud, thud, with an irregularity of rhythm. interspersed, like the counterpoint in an alien orchestration, is the flutter of wings. and then, like another section entering, we begin to hear the scratching and clawing at the roof. close shot lydia looking up toward the roof, the sound getting louder. she squeezes her eyes shut. two shot cathy and melanie as the child cuddles up into her arms. over the other sounds, there comes a new sound, the unmistakable rat tat tat tattat of a woodpecker. it stops. it begins again. rat tat tat tattat tat. tat }
<C>__{cathy}
<P>__{(in terror)}
<D>__{i'm... i'm sick, melanie. i want.. i want to throw...}
<A>__{her face pale, she rises suddenly and starts for the bathroom.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i will go with you.}
<A>__{they leave the room. mitch and lydia sit in silence. we hear cathy retching offscreen, almost drowned out by the shuffling of wings and the rasping of claws, the incessant thudding of birds striking the house. full shot the room mitch rises and puts more wood on the fire. the sound of the birds is still everywhere around the house. he looks at his watch. he rises, walks into the kitchen to check the back door. it seems all right. the camera follows him into the dining room. he stops at the cage with the lovebirds. close shot the lovebirds watching him. is there menace or innocence in their eyes? he cannot tell. close shot mitch looking at the lovebirds in puzzlement. there is suddenly a new sound offscreen, the splintering of wood, the tearing sound of bigger beaks. alarmed, he turns. med. shot mitch coming into the entry hall. close shot the front door the wood is beginning to splinter as the bigger birds outside assail the door. full shot mitch turning quickly, the camera following him into the dining room. he pulls the cloth off the table, begins moving it toward the door. in the entry, he lifts the table on end and piles it against the door. he goes into the kitchen again, camera following. he upends the enamel topped table, drags it to the back door. he is piling chairs against the table when melanie comes in. she looks at what he is doing with alarm. mitch looks in the direction of where his mother is and then back to melanie, with an expression almost of desperation. both turn back to the barricaded door. the clawing and the pecking fills the void. the noise is a din now, insidious and increasingly more frightening.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{when will they stop?}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{i thought they'd have stopped by now.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{what time is it?}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{almost two a.m.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{you must be exhausted.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{how about you?}
<A>__{she shakes her head. they both move into the dining room, the camera following them. the lovebirds are sitting in their cage, close together, silent. mitch picks up a chair, ready to carry it to the front door. he hesitates, puts down the chair, goes to the cage. close shot mitch looking at the birds, wondering. close shot the birds looking back at him. again, it is impossible to read their expressions. malice or benevolence? med. shot mitch he raises his hand, brings it toward the bars of the cage. close shot the birds watching, unmoving. close shot mitch's finger as he thrusts it through the bars. the birds sit unmoving. one of them tweets. two shot melanie and mitch}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{i wonder if cathy fed them.}
<A>__{he turns away from her, goes to the cupboard, opens the door, takes out a small box of bird feed. close shot the cage as his hand approaches the door. the birds are watching him. his hand hesitates. then his thumb and forefinger lift the small catch on the cage door. his fingers open the door. cautiously, in tight closeup, his hand goes into the cage. the birds sit and watch. one of them tweets. he removes the small feeding tray, puts the bird seed into it, replaces it in the cage. the birds hesitate another moment. then, tweeting, they begin to eat. full shot the dining room as mitch closes the door to the cage. melanie is slumped against the wall. he goes to her and takes her in his arms. wearily, she raises her head. the sound of the shuffling, pecking, clawing birds is everywhere around them.}
<C>__{mitch}
<P>__{(holding her)}
<D>__{you should have left when you wanted to.}
<A>__{she shakes her head.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{you'd have been safe in san francisco.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i don't want to be safe. i want to be with you.}
<A>__{there is something pathetically comic about her voice, like a small child's, confused but defiant. holding her close, mitch laughs, and she laughs with him. exhausted, they stand in each other's arms, laughing in that weary, silly, dead of night sort of way. and suddenly... the lights go out.}
<C>__{mitch}
<P>__{(in the darkness)}
<D>__{the power.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{mitch...}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{wait here. don't move.}
<A>__{the screen is totally black for perhaps five seconds. in the blackness, we hear the birds clawing and ripping, and the sound is enormously magnified. a flashlight suddenly goes on. two shot melanie and mitch as he comes to her with the flash. we see them only dimly as he directs the beam upwards.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{we'd better light some of those lamps.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{no... wait.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{hold me.}
<A>__{in the near darkness, we see them embrace and kiss. it is almost black in the room except for the strange effect of the flashlight as he holds it behind her.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{i think they're easing off.}
