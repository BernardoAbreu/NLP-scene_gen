<L>__{interior hall, u.n. continuous}
<A>__{adlai, briefcase in hand, marches down the hall at the hand of his team: staffers and photo interpreters with large leather portfolio bags. the big double doors to the council chamber loom, and he gestures to the photo interpreters.}
<C>__{adlai}
<D>__{wait here.}
<A>__{and then a doorman throws open the door for him.}
<L>__{interior u.n. security council chambers continuous}
<A>__{adlai enters. he is instantly dwarfed by the enormous room. lights, t.v. cameras, the imposing circular arrangement of delegation tables. and the entire world is watching. adlai pauses. then as the first security council members begin to notice him, he heads for the vacant seats for the american delegation. the romanian delegate saws the air.}
<C>__{romanian delegate}
<P>__{(through translator)}
<D>__{...we call upon the world to condemn this purely american provocation...}
<A>__{but as the romanian wheezes on, all eyes are on adlai. adlai takes his seat, his staffers behind him. they pass him up papers, and he spreads them before him, taking no notice that the entire room is staring at him. adlai finally glances up. across the circle sits zorin, in the flesh, at the head of his own tough looking delegation. he acknowledges adlai with a superior smile.}
<C>__{romanian delegate }
<D>__{we, the people of romania, stand in solidarity with the people of cuba and their revolution in the face of this american threat to world peace. thank you, mr. chairman.}
<A>__{the romanian delegate leans back from his microphone. zorin leans forward, begins in russian, and the translator's voice catches up with him. his tone, body language, composure are all that of complete confidence.}
<C>__{zorin}
<P>__{(through translator)}
<D>__{we are glad you could join us, mr. stevenson.}
<A>__{adlai nods, returns to his notes, as zorin continues.}
<C>__{zorin }
<D>__{for the last couple of hours i have heard nothing but questions from the world here. the united states has led us to the brink of calamity. the peoples of the world want to know why. we are told again and again of this so called incontrovertible evidence of offensive weapons in cuba. yet we are not allowed to see this evidence. are your spy planes so secret you cannot share this evidence with us? some planes?!}
<A>__{the audience laughs. zorin basks in it. and then grows stern.}
<C>__{zorin }
<D>__{or perhaps there is no such evidence. perhaps the united states is mistaken.}
