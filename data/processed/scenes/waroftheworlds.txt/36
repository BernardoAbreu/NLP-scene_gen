<L>__{interior harland's house basement near dusk}
<A>__{ray looks at the mysterious red plant that is growing wildly. he feels it and them snaps a piece of it off of a pipe. he examines it closely as he walks over to the window where lights are beaming in and out as the robots work. he takes another piece of a wall and studies that one. ray hears a hovering craft over his head. a light flows over the roof boards that streams down to the other end of a board hall in the basement. harland is sitting on the stairs with rachel.}
<C>__{harland}
<D>__{you miss your mommy? i had a little girl nearly your age. you know, if anything happens to your daddy, i will take care of you.}
<A>__{ray is very angry that harland is saying things like that to his daughter.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{rachel!}
<A>__{rachel runs towards him and he points to stand beside him. they both stare at harland, on the stairs, in dismay.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(distinctly angry, but not yelling)}
<D>__{you don't have anything to say to her, do you understand? if you want to talk to somebody, or ask somebody a question, you ask me!}
<C>__{harland}
<P>__{(also angry at ray) what exactly is}
<D>__{your plan, ray? i know what i'm gonna do. how about you? you gonna sit here, wait for them to come get you? is that your plan?}
<A>__{harland walks around to different parts of the basement doing miscellaneous things.}
<C>__{harland}
<D>__{maybe you want to get caught. couple of days hiding in a basement too much for you, i bet. you'll probably turn yourself right in!}
<A>__{the robots outside stop moving. all the rumbling stops.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{listen. it stopped.}
<C>__{harland}
<P>__{(paying no attention) maybe you'll be}
<D>__{okay. maybe you'll get lucky and they'll train you as their pet. you know, train you, feed you, teach you how to do tricks...}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(yells) will you shut up and listen?!?!?!}
<A>__{pieces of wood fall from the hole as a robot camera comes floating down into the hole. ray hides behind the stairs. the camera eye opens and lights turn on for it. rachel is hiding as well. the camera looks around the couch. ray moves as to not be seen by it moving around the couch. it sees a rat and quickly follows it for a few seconds. ray and harland exchange looks as ray runs toward rachel to hide with her. the robot continues checking out the basement. harland grabs an axe to cut off the camera from it's limb. ray shakes his head no to get him to stop. ray silently does expressions to convince him not to. harland goes towards ray so they can hide together. harland almost makes it before he thuds against a cabinet full of glass containers which clang together. the robot hears this and turns around toward the noise. they run to a different spot. robot gets closer... ray puts a mirror in front of the doorway to trick the robot into seeing another robot. the camera looks over the mirror and sees nothing. it turns around just as... rachel's boot slides, making a noise. the robot views into the boot that is hanging out. it looks behind the mirror to find just a boot sitting there. ray, rachel and harland are in the middle of the basement. a sight of relief comes as the robot camera exit's out of the hole. now the actual aliens come into the basement. harland turns the lantern out and runs to hide. the aliens look around the basement. they look at, smell, and touch various different things throughout the basement. ray, rachel, and harland scurry to different parts of the basement. harland loads his gun and aims it to fire at one of the aliens but the gun is pulled back by ray.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(dead silent) give me that!}
<A>__{ray and harland are in a silent fight for the gun. they both have their hands on it. the aliens continue looking around. ray and harland are both sweating bullets fighting for the gun. still silently. harland pins ray against the wall and forces him down to the ground to try and break the gun free of his grasp. the aliens are seen taking and smelling a photograph from a box. ray lets go of the gun and harland jerks it away from him just as the vibration like noise is heard from the robot. the aliens scurry out through the open hole. harland comes down to ray, now sitting on the floor, and says....}

<D>__{you and i... i don't think we are on the same page.}
