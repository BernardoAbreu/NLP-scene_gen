<L>__{interior gym day}
<A>__{we join a pep rally, already in progress. the dance team attempts to rile up the school with a rousing rendition of michael jackson's `bad.' in the stands, rhi sits with marianne and nina.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{so, olive wasn't at school today.}
<A>__{she extends her palms to nina and rhi, who both slap them. marianne puts her arm around rhi.}
<C>__{marianne }
<D>__{i'm so glad you're with us now.}
<C>__{rhiannon}
<D>__{me too. you guys fucking rock.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{we don't say that word, rhiannon.}
<C>__{nina}
<P>__{(helpfully)}
<D>__{just say `effing' instead. we effing rock.}
<A>__{marianne nods in agreement, however rhi is confused.}
<C>__{rhiannon}
<D>__{but isn't that just implying the same word?}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{oh, rhiannon. we have so much to teach you. it's okay to imply things.}
<A>__{rhiannon looks at her new best friends, who just smile at her. the song ends and there's a drum roll.}
<C>__{rhiannon}
<D>__{yay! it's time for meerkat todd.}
<P>__{(sexually)}
<D>__{i just want to rip that costume off him and }
<A>__{marianne puts her hand firmly on rhi's knee.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{why don't you just not talk for a while, okay hon?}
<A>__{rhi puts her head down. the drum roll ends and meerkat todd bounces out in costume. he jumps around enthusing the student body but then he goes out of the gym and reenters pushing a}
<B>__{dumpster.}
<A>__{the familiar chords of the james bond theme `nobody does it better' plays from the band. meerkat todd opens the lid of the dumpster and olive, dressed in a glittery and slinky red dress, with a boa draped around her bare shoulder, pops up and croons with a handheld mic and slightly different lyrics:}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{nobody does it better. makes me feel sad for the rest. nobody does it half as good as me. baby, i'm the best.}
<A>__{todd lifts olive out of the dumpster and she sings her ass off and she's quite good.}
<C>__{olive }
<D>__{i wasn't lookin,' but somehow they found me. i tried to hide from your love light. but like heaven above me the guys who loved me are keepin' all my secrets safe tonight.}
<A>__{she winks at the audience. the guys begin to wolf whistle and howl at her sheer brilliance. she begins to rub her hands seductively over meerkat todd's furry costume, eventually unzipping it and taking off the head to reveal: blue devil todd! the crowd goes wild.}
<C>__{olive }
<D>__{and nobody does it better though sometimes i wish someone could. nobody does it quite the way i do. why'd i have to be so good?}
<A>__{she saunters over to rhi and kisses her on the cheek, leaving a big, red lip mark.}
<C>__{olive }
<D>__{the way that they hold me whenever they hold me there's some kind of magic inside you. that keeps me from runnin', but just keep it comin'! how'd you learn to do the things you do?}
<A>__{she sees that gibbons is not amused, but that doesn't stop her.}
<C>__{olive }
<D>__{oh, and nobody does it better. makes me feel sad for the rest.}
<C>__{olive }
<D>__{nobody does it half as good as me. baby, baby! darlin', i'm the best!}
<A>__{she walks over to a couple of horn players, and runs her fingers seductively over their (uh) instruments. the crowd goes wild some appalled, but most enthused. olive sashays through the crowd as the male teens scream and stuff money down her bodice.}
<C>__{olive }
<D>__{baby you're the best! darlin', you're the best! baby, you're the best!}
<A>__{the song ends and olive takes blue devil todd's hand.}
<C>__{olive }
<P>__{(to the student body)}
<D>__{this is just a free preview. for the main event log on to www.freeolivep.com tonight at 6 p.m. now, i know this conflicts with tonight's basketball game, but c'mon would you rather be here cheering on the meerkats}
<P>__{(looking at todd, lasciviously)}
<D>__{or watch me do one.}
<A>__{there are audible gasps, but excitement nonetheless. gibbons angrily storms over and takes the microphone.}
<C>__{principal gibbons}
<P>__{(through gritted teeth)}
<D>__{young lady, to my office. now.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{yeah, i can't. i'm gonna go bang my boyfriend while the whole school watches. but good luck with the game thing. go meerkats.}
<A>__{she plods out, triumphantly.}
