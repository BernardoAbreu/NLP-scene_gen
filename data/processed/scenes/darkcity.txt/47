<A>__{the inspector climbs a staircase, enters a dark room. two figures move about. bumstead glances at a uniformed man, standing beside a fake fire, who acknowledges his arrival. to the side, a police photographer flashes something swinging back and forth, hanging from the ceiling. it looks like... fredrick. dead. his arms and legs missing. a pool of blood beneath the mutilated torso. bumstead looks at the cop.}

<D>__{yours too?}
<A>__{bumstead nods. he removes a notebook from his pocket, walks about the room, glances at objects, makes notes. bumstead steps over to a small rectangular hole in the wall. he examines it carefully, then bends down and puts his head through. on the other side is a corridor snaking off into darkness. just beneath the hole, is a broken dish and a puddle. lying half in the puddle is the business card of doctor d.p. schreber m.d. without removing his head from the hole he shouts to the nearby cop.}
