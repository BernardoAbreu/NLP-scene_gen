<A>__{we look down with edward, who is drifting right for the stage. he can't steer. he's helpless. but then, a blast of fireworks from the sides of the stage. the lights go out as a drum roll begins. it's just enough cover for edward to remain unseen. he lands with a clang on the lighting catwalk above the stage. he barely grabs on, disconnecting his chute just as the curtain goes up. edward looks out at the sea of excited soldiers. every one of them would kill him. he's the legless cricket left on the anthill.}
