<A>__{trevor rummages through a closet. reaching up to a shelf above him, he tugs at a big cardboard box and pulls. the entire box comes crashing down and out spill about fifty vhs tapes, all hand labeled: kirsty & trevor, then the date. he puts one in the vcr, hits play... it's his wedding video. trevor watches the festivity of the wedding on the screen, he smiles for the first time. the wedding portion of the tape ends and a not so clean edit takes us into the honeymoon.}
