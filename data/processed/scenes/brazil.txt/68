<L>__{interior record clerks pool day}
<A>__{it is the end of the work day. the clerks are busily getting their coats and leaving the office. as the last one goes mr. kurtzman comes out of his private office with his hat and coat on. he turns out the office light. he sees sam isolated in the empty room, still working at his computer console. totally absorbed in what he is doing.}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<D>__{oh ... sam. i've had the transport pool onto me ... you don't know anything about a personnel transporter gone missing do you?}
<A>__{sam doesn't seem to hear him. on the computer screen is a front and side view picture of jill. her name and code number is at the top of the screen. sam is punching up personal dossier information like "age", "height", "weight", "colour of hair", "colour of eyes", "distinguishing marks" etc.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(preoccupied)}
<D>__{a "personnel" transporter? they've got it wrong. i had a personal transporter. i will do the paperwork tomorrow }
<A>__{sam punches up a few more categories for jill's dossier.}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<D>__{is it all right about mrs buttle's cheque?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i delivered it.}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<D>__{can i forget it?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{sam punches a few more buttons on the computer.}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<D>__{what a relief!}
<P>__{(on reflection)}
<D>__{i shall probably have nightmares.}
<A>__{at this point the word "classified" superimposes itself over most of the screen and "irq 3" starts agitating at the bottom}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{damn! blast!}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you don't happen to know how i can get around an irq 3 do you?}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<D>__{all information on 3rd level suspects is classified.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i know that.}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<D>__{all enquiries to information retrieval. which is hopeless, of course. they never tell you anything. but come the time they want something from us ...}
<A>__{throughout this verbal wallpaper sam has been punching keys cancelling the classified overprinterior he then punches in the code for a hard copy print out. jill's two view computer portrait rolls out as sam ponders his options.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(cutting off kurtzman)}
<D>__{i've go to accept that promotion to get behind this, haven't i?}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(realising what he's suggesting)}
<D>__{no! you can't! you've only just turned it down!}
<P>__{(thinking sam is joking)}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i never signed the form.}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<D>__{i did it for you.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what! shit!}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<D>__{it's what you wanted isn't it?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yes ... no ... i don't, know.}
<A>__{kurtzman picks up jill's print out and glances at it. he grimaces and drops it back on the desk with a shudder.}
<C>__{kurtzman}
<D>__{come on, before they turn the lights out.}
<A>__{sam nods. he turns off the machine. he stands up and follows kurtzman towards the door. the door is some distance away, and before they get there all the lights go out. kurtzman bumps into a desk and curses.}
