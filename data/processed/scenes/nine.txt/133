<L>__{exterior medieval lanes, trastevere night}
<A>__{guido stops the car by some narrow streets in the trastevere, just south of the vatican. they watch the photographers hurtle past in search of them. they sit for a second.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{it's good to see you.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i'm assuming that's code for there's no script.}
<A>__{guido is exasperated.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{why is everybody so suddenly obsessed with the script?}
<A>__{claudia listens. she's always seduced by the way he speaks, his passion. they fall in love with each other in every movie, that's the way of it. guido lights a cigarette.}
<C>__{guido }
<D>__{talk to the people who love you in our films, they're not interested in my script! they're interested in the way you turn your head, the way the camera looks past you to the moon... the way you smile a little as you cry, the way you really do blush for the camera how?! }
<P>__{(enough examples, sighs)}
<D>__{who even knows, but whatever else it is, it's not my script.}
<A>__{guido has no confidence in what he's saying anymore. they get out of the car and begin to walk away. it's almost deserted here.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{so lilli says i'm playing a million different parts }
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{not a million you're the muses, the incredible women who made italy what it is today, a country run by men who are themselves run by women, whether they know it or not.}
<C>__{claudia}
<P>__{(teasing him)}
<D>__{so i'm the women behind the great men?}
<C>__{guido}
<P>__{(trying hard to tell the truth)}
<D>__{the great women...}
<C>__{guido }
<D>__{in a way yes you have this man in the story and he's, he wants to take hold of everything, to devour everything, he can't let anything go, or, he doesn't want to, and he changes direction every day, because he's lost, he's dying, he's bleeding to death...}
<C>__{claudia}
<P>__{(deflating)}
<D>__{and these muses they fall in love with the man?}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{exactly! they fall in love with him.}
<C>__{claudia}
<P>__{(decisive)}
<D>__{i'd rather be the man.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i'd rather be the man.}
<A>__{she grabs his hat, puts it on her head. saunters down the road. he follows.}
