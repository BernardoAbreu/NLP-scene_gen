<L>__{exterior rudy's night}
<A>__{it's new year's eve at rudy's, a hole in the wall dive. people stream into the bar to celebrate. outside, carl kendall (30s) and his soon to be ex girlfriend kath are having a quiet intense discussion.}
<C>__{kath}
<D>__{you don't do anything more. you used to be fun. now you hardly ever even leave your apartment.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i'm here, aren't i?}
<C>__{kath}
<D>__{that's because it's new year's eve. you have to be here. besides, it's not only social stuff. you used to have dreams. you wanted to go to business school, you wanted to work for the world bank.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{so i discovered b school's not for me. people grow.}
<C>__{kath}
<D>__{growing is "x is not for me so i will do y." you went x is not for me and so i guess i will sit on the couch for the rest of my life.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(acquiescing)}
<D>__{well, look, this sucks, but i understand where you're coming from.}
<C>__{kath}
<D>__{this is the problem. you don't even care that i'm breaking up with you.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{of course i care. but i also understand.}
<C>__{kath}
<D>__{you shouldn't just understand. you should be mad. or upset. or sad. or something.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{we're at different places in our lives. i get it.}
<C>__{kath}
<D>__{your girlfriend of two years breaks up with you right before new year's eve and all you can say is "i get it?" it is completely within your right to call me a bitch.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{that would be inappropriate.}
<C>__{kath}
<P>__{(tearing up)}
<D>__{i can't believe i've been dating someone so emotionless.}

<D>__{rooney might throw up.}

<D>__{it's true. i'm very close.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i see that happen like every night. good night and happy new year.}

<D>__{until i'm relieved as a greeter, my hands are tied.}
<A>__{the bank customer sits down in the sectioned off waiting area as carl stands in the middle of the floor. it is very awkward. no one comes in. carl slowly moves so a column blocks the customer's view of him. now that carl's behind the column, he has a clear view of the entrance of the bank. through the floor to ceiling windows, he sees the handsome new president of southwest bank, chris parker, tear up in a mercedes. he steps out of the mercedes with a hot girl on his arm. he and the girl walk into the bank. carl stares at them, jealously.}

<D>__{what? so? i'm like a sexual camel. i only need it once every couple years.}
<C>__{peter}

<D>__{you've become a complete cave dweller.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i am not a cave dweller. just the other day, we all went to summerfest and snuck backstage and you bet me i wouldn't steal something and so i stole a drumstick from that horrible swedish hillbilly band. that's not very cave dweller of me.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{just the other day? that was seven years ago.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{but that's not possible i was already working at the bank by then.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{you had started there three years earlier. why you've worked at that place for so long is beyond me. you had so much potential. you shouldn't be a teller. you should be the guy who tells the guy who tells the teller what to do.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{i've been a teller at southwest bank for ten years? how the hell did that happen?}
<P>__{(doing the math)}

<A>__{carl looks around. everyone is nodding along with it.}
<C>__{sanji }
<D>__{from the external. and the external is manipulated through our choices. and our choices start with one word.}
<A>__{the music abruptly switches to the opening beats of "jump" by the pointer sisters. the rosy colored lights flip to bright white and sweep across the convention center room. it is suddenly like a rock concert. sanji (50s) busts through the giant banner. the whole crowd starts cheering.}

<D>__{yes!}
<A>__{instead of "jump", sanji's yelling "yes!"}
<C>__{sanji }
<D>__{say yes! for your life! yes! change starts now! yes! yes! yes! say it with me! say yes!}

<P>__{(explaining)}
<D>__{you cannot say "yes, the world is flat" because that is an untruth.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(reading the document)}
<D>__{3) if someone discovers you are a yes man, you do not have to say yes to them. 4) to avoid yes, you cannot avoid contact. therefore, you must always answer your phone, the door, your postal mail, your email, etc and so on and so forth. 5) you must choose a yesponsor to keep you on the straight and narrow.}
<P>__{(to sanji)}
<D>__{who should that be?}
<C>__{sanji}
<D>__{a close friend who will not tell a soul.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(reading the document)}
<D>__{5) i hereby void the "do you want" loophole.}
<P>__{(to sanji)}
<D>__{what is that?}
<C>__{sanji}
<D>__{if someone asks you "do you want to go to the art museum" and you do not want to, you may not use this lack of desire as an excuse to not go. and finally, a warning.}

<D>__{what do you say?}
<C>__{carl}

<C>__{sanji}
<D>__{kind of. and finally, my friend, please hold out your hand.}
<A>__{carl holds out his hand. sanji pulls out an iron brand that's been heating over a hot pot and brands carl's palm.}

<D>__{ahhhhhhhh!}

<D>__{i've started a microloan project. i figure that if someone needs less than ten grand why should they go to a loan shark when they can come to a legitimate banking institution?}
<C>__{chris parker}
<D>__{because the paperwork makes any profit moot. unless you're raiding our coffers.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{no. i wouldn't do that.}

<D>__{i would if i could, so why wouldn't you?}

<C>__{chris parker }
<D>__{but then i looked closer at the numbers. 85% of the loan recipients have been paying them off according to the bank's schedule. not just that, but 72% of that group have returned as regular full loan customers. this is both a moneymaker and good for the community. that like never happens!}
