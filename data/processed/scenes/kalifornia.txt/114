<L>__{interior brian and carrie's motel room later}
<A>__{the door opens revealing brian silhouetted in the doorway. under the influence of lucky lager, he fumbles with the key... gets inside and noisily shuts the door behind him. carrie remains stonily silent, in the dark.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{gotta see a man about a mule... what's wrong?}
<A>__{a few seconds pass.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{the same thing that's been "wrong" the whole trip. your good buddy early.}
<A>__{carrie, in bed, switches on the side table light. reveals brian leaning on the wall trying to get his shoes off without falling over.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{who said he's my good buddy?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{you sure been acting like you were...}
<P>__{(redneck accent)}
<D>__{...out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang.}
<A>__{brian points to the empty beer bottles on the table.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{hey come on, you two were drinking too... so what's the big deal.}
<A>__{brian throws his shoes somewhere and heads toward the bathroom.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{yeah, and you should've seen how terrified she was that he'd find out. he beats her.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{how do you know that?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{she told me...}
<P>__{(adding)}
<D>__{...but only when she "deserves" it. did you know he was in jail?}
<B>__{bathroom}
<A>__{brian turns on the light. takes a piss. a long one.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{yeah, for stealing a car. aaahhhh.}
<A>__{suddenly, from right behind him:}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{bullshit!}
<A>__{startled, brian turns to see carrie.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{...he told her it was for carrying a gun, but the truth could be murder for all we know.}
<A>__{no response from brian. carrie walks away.}
<B>__{living room}
<A>__{carrie steps over to the bed, pulls the sheets back. brian leans out the bathroom door:}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{stop being so fucking melodramatic! if it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! geezus brian!}
<A>__{brian smacks himself on the forehead (a sarcastic "how stupid of me!") he pulls his shirt off over his head, and admits...}
<C>__{brian}
<P>__{(sarcastically)}
<D>__{of course! the accent, the clothes, and those table manners!... he's got to be a mass murderer!}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{what else could he be?}
<A>__{he switches off the bathroom light, steps out of the doorway, and begins to pull his jeans off. carrie climbs into bed.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{you know, it wouldn't even surprise me if he turned out to be... a republican!}
<A>__{brian tosses his jeans and moves toward the bed. carrie switches off the the only light in the room. in the dark, we hear a thud as brian trips over a chair.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{goddamnit!... my fucking toe!}
