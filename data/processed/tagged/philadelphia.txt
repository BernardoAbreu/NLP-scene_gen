<C>__{andrew beckett }
<D>__{my client has one of the finest and most respected safety records in the business, your honor!}

<C>__{joe}
<D>__{your honor, since rockwell corp. began construction, the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foul smelling, germ carrying, pestilent dust. my client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily! other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of outrage!}

<D>__{i know what it means. your honor, imagine how the children in this neighborhood have been made to feel. the pounding of construction ringing in their ears as this skyscraper, a tribute to mankind's greed, grows daily, casting an ominous shadow over their lives, filling them with dread even as they are surrounded in a black, toxic fog, blocking out the sun while poisoning their lungs! and counselor calls it harmless?!}
<A>__{his back turned momentarily to the judge, andrew mouths to jamey: "not bad." but he whips around, serious again:}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{your honor, counselor is attempting to portray my client as a hideous manifestation of evil and corruption. but nothing could be further from the truth. rockwell has generously contributed ten thousand dollars to this neighborhood's schools, clinics and youth centers! granting a restraining order on the construction site will throw hundreds of philadelphians out of work, and will lend validation to this contemptible and groundless nuisance suit, which speaks directly to the kind of greed and treachery that today is threatening the very fabric of our society.}

<C>__{judge garnett}
<D>__{fine. i've asked the litigants to be present for this conference, in the hope we can settle this matter today, among ourselves... there is nothing i hate more, than to see lawyers suing each other. if you look at the opinion polls, when mr. john q. citizen is asked to rank professions according to the respect he holds for them... where are the lawyers? somewhere below personal fitness trainers and only slightly above child pornographers. if we keep suing each other, if we fail to settle the smallest difference among ourselves with mutual respect, if we continue to scrap like bucks in heat, we'll fall lower on that list. and when people lose respect for lawyers, they lose respect for the law. and when this society loses all respect for the law, we'll be murdered in our beds, my friends, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground and our children and our grandchildren will live like savages.}
