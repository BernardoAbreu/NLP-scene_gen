<L>__{exterior frank's house night}
<A>__{frank's car is parked in the driveway. a light goes on in a basement window.}
<L>__{interior frank's house basement}
<A>__{frank hangs back, drink in hand, as rachel explores the basement. frank has fitted it out as a combination gym target range weapons workshop. the place has a kind of unfussy order about it, a simplicity.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(almost to herself)}
<D>__{it's very quiet here.}
<A>__{she walks to some shelves a random selection of books, football and karate trophies, framed citations and other memorabilia. she glances at a dusty framed photo of a football team.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{west virginia university football. god, look at you.}
<A>__{she looks at frank, quizzically.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{what'd you play?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{end.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{were you tough?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no. fast.}
<A>__{rachel puts down her drink and moves toward a samurai sword that is mounted in its scabbard on the wall. she looks at it, peering closely.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you some kind of a samurai, too?}
<A>__{frank smiles.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{they said you were in the secret service. what made you get out?}
<A>__{frank moves away and sits on a sofa against the wall.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{money.}
<A>__{rachel looks around at frank's modest home.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i can see your tastes are extravagant.}
<A>__{she looks at frank and then back at the sword. she reaches out to touch it.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{may i?}
<A>__{frank nods. rachel takes it off its mount carefully, unhooks the scabbard and begins to slide it off.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{watch yourself.}
<A>__{rachel slides the scabbard off. the naked blade is breathtaking. rachel holds the sword out before her. she walks toward frank, then stops and looks over the blade at him.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you're a hard one to figure, frank farmer.}
<A>__{he stares at her. she steps closer, so the blade is only about a foot from his face.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{it seems to me a bodyguard must know little peace.}
<A>__{frank stands up so that the point of the sword is only about an inch from his chest. he reaches out over the blade to rachel's neck and unties the silk scarf she is wearing there. one hand draws the scarf away. the other hand lingers for a moment on her neck, then lifts away.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{watch this.}
<A>__{he has raised the scarf over his head, in the space between them. with two hands he spreads it out and then lets it go. slowly, billowing, the scarf floats down over the blade and is cut in two. these two pieces float slowly to the floor. frank takes rachel's wrist and moves the sword away to the side. they are both holding it as rachel presses her body against frank's and they begin to kiss.}
