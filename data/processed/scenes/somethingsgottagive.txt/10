<L>__{interior erica's dining room that night}
<A>__{marin serves plates of pasta with lobster. zoe pours wine and erica tosses a salad. harry is the only one sitting.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{so, mom, how's the new play? you gettin' happy with it?}
<A>__{marin places a plate in front of harry then runs her finger along "the nape of his neck. they smile at each other as she continues on. erica notices, tries not to respond.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{well, the thing with me is that i'm about 90% hard word, 10% talent and so far the talent part hasn't exactly kicked in yet.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{yeah, right...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what's your play about?}
<A>__{marin and zoe stop what they are doing and turn to erica. she's hesitant to reveal this.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{about? well, i'm not exactly sure which is a bit of a problem, but so far it's about a divorced woman, a writer, she's this high strung, over amped, controlling, know it all neurotic. . .}
<P>__{(everyone stares at her)}
<D>__{who's incredibly cute and lovable.}
<P>__{(more stares)}
<D>__{it's a comedy.}
<P>__{(takes a seat next to zoe)}
<D>__{so, how did you two meet?}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{at a wine auction at sotheby's. harry was the big buyer of the night.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i kept winking at marin as she was conducting the auction and apparently every time i did that she misunderstood and i ended up buying cases of outrageously expensive wine.}
<A>__{zoe and marin laugh.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{ever been married, harry?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{no. no, i haven't.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{wow. now why do you think that is?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{some people just don't fit the mold. and so far...}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{hey, if it ain't broke.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{exactly.}
<A>__{harry leans back, places his arm around marin's chair. erica takes note.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{wait a second, aren't you like a famous bachelor?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i wouldn't say i'm famous.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{no, i think i read a piece on you in new york magazine.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i guess people find it interesting that i've escaped the noose for so long.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{yeah, wasn't the name of the article, "the escape artist"?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{wait. i read that article. that was you? you were once engaged to somebody big. who was it? not joan collins.. .wait. ..carly simon?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{yeah, it was somebody cool like that.}
<P>__{(trying to remember)}
<D>__{not martha stewart....}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{you could just ..'ask him.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{no, this is more fun. it's like i'm not here.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{harry was once engaged to diane sawyer. okay?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{right. diane sawyer. i love her.}
<C>__{erica}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{i'm impressed.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah, women your age love that about me.}
<A>__{erica pauses on that one.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(trying to get thru this)}
<D>__{you know what i mean.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{yes i do.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{it's not a bad thing to say 'women your age'.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{no...i'm sure it was a compliment.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{it was. ..just the truth.}
<C>__{zoe}
<P>__{(stepping in)}
<D>__{so when was this engagement?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{long time ago. she was just this adorable lanky girl from kentucky with the greatest pair of legs i'd ever seen... never understood her ending up with a job where she never showed them.}
<P>__{(munches on his lobster)}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{you're not serious? she's diane sawyer, she goes into caves in afghanistan with a shmahtah on her head. who cares about her legs?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{just anyone who's ever had the pleasure of... you know what? i hate to eat and run but...}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{no, wait. this is actually a very fascinating dynamic what's going on at this table...}
<C>__{marin}
<P>__{(warning him)}
<D>__{zoe teaches women's studies at columbia. . .}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{oh, so this is gonna hurt.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{no, come on, listen, here's the rub for women. look at what we have here with you and erica. harry, you've been around the block a few times, right? you're what? around 60, never been married, which, we all know, if you were a woman, would be a curse, you'd be an old maid, a spinster, blah, blah, blah... okay, so instead of pitying you, they write articles about you, celebrate your never marrying, it makes you illusive and ungettable. you're a real catch. then, take my gorgeous sister here...}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{any chance of you stopping here?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{come on, this is interesting. i mean, look at her, she's so accomplished, the most successful woman playwright since who? lillian hellman? she's over fifty, divorced and still sits in night after night because the available guys her age want}
<P>__{(to marin)}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{ forgive me honey for saying this, but they want girls that look like marin so the whole over fifty dating scene is geared completely towards men leaving older women out and as a result that makes the older women more and more productive and more and more interesting, which, in turn, makes them even less desirable because as we all know men, especially older men, are threatened and deathly afraid of interesting and accomplished women. it's just so clear. single older women, as a demographic, are as fucked a group as can ever exist.}
<A>__{erica and harry's eyes connect for a millisecond. hear the}
<B>__{sound of plates crashing.}
