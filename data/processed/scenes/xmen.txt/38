<D>__{youire not the only one with gifts.}
<A>__{when he speaks, his lips do not move. we realize logan ihearsi the voice in his head. in addition, the voice is accompanied by the familiar sound of foot steps indicating that perhaps xavier had herded logan through the mansion with his mind. he does not like it. xavier comes out from behind his desk. we see that he is in a motored wheelchair. realizing that he is safe for the moment, logan begins putting on his stolen clothes.}
