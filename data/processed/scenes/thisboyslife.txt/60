<A>__{a) (afternoon) toby delivers papers in a sack filled with papers slung over one shoulder which thuds against his hip with every step making him tilt to one side against the weight. b) (night) toby sits in a utility porch. the floor around him is two feet deep in horse chestnuts. with a knife and a pair of pliers he husks the chestnuts. his hands are covered with scrapes and cuts and the chestnut hulls bleed a juice that has dyed them a bright yellow.}

<D>__{dear toby, i sure do miss you, honey the house is like a tomb since you left. so quiet. my only entertainment tonight was watching marian eat a whole pint of ice cream. i hope you're liking it up in concrete. i just know you'll try hard in school and be good and mind dwight. i worry about you so much, and i hope this will be just what you need.}
<A>__{c) (day) toby rubs futilely at his yellow hands with a cloth and watches norma, who is drying her hair in her bedroom. she bends over so her head is in a patch of sunlight. toby is riveted by the girl and her hair gleaming in the sunlight. d) (afternoon) again see toby delivering his papers. he sees arthur gayle coming toward him in the street. his hips sway as he walks, and his head tilts to one side. as he and toby pass one another, he raises one arm and points at toby. the he walks on.}

<D>__{dear mom, thanks for the birthday present. it fit fine. you don't have to worry so much. i'm okay here. the weather is nice, and i like scouts a lot. dwight took us all to see bridge on the river kwai. i liked it. so things are all right with me, except for stupid pearl, who i hate. don't worry all the time...}
<A>__{e) (night) dwight introduces toby at a scout meeting. all the other boys have on scout uniforms. f) (day) toby is on the utility porch husking the horse chestnuts. his hands are now orange. pearl stands in the doorway watching him work. norma appears beside pearl. norma's face turns sympathetic.}

<D>__{you remind me of that boy in the fairy tale who had to spend twenty years sifting sand to find a golden needle. remember that one?}
<A>__{toby doesn't answer. the two girls move away. toby sighs, and picks up another chestnut. g) (day) toby, keeping an eye on the door to make sure he's unobserved, reaches under the mattress of skipper's bed and pulls out several billfold sized black and white pornographic photographs. the hair styles of the women in them are decades old. toby takes the photographs into the bathroom, shutting the door behind him.}

<D>__{dear toby, just a note before going to bed. dwight tells me that the two of you are getting along like a house afire. i'm so glad. i wanted this to work out for you. you left your sock cap here. do you need it...?}
<A>__{h) (night) skipper is asleep in his bed. across the room, toby lies with his portable radio against his head. we hear, very, very softly, rosemary clooney crooning "hey, there." he's tired. he's lonely. he's miserable.}
