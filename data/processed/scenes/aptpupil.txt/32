<A>__{todd stands facing his open locker. he is staring at his report card. sweat collects on his forehead. he looks like he is about to explode. he wipes his brow with his sleeve and turns around to see if anyone notices him. two students catch his eye. they are both asian. they are smiling and pouring over each other's report cards. todd zips open his backpack, giving us a quick glimpse of the disassembled rifle pieces inside. he throws the report card in and zips up the bag. slinging the bag over his shoulder, he slams the locker shut and heads off down the hall.}
