<L>__{interior studio day}
<A>__{whiskey commercial shoot. the set is full of activity as the japanese crew work. bob, in a shawl collared tuxedo sits at a european style bar set with a cut crystal glass of whiskey. a japanese girl quickly powders his face as they adjust lights and the director and crew speak in hurried japanese. the director (with blue contact lenses) says a few long sentences in japanese. translator, a middle aged woman in a coordinated outfit, translates but it is only a short sentence now.}
<C>__{translator}
<D>__{he wants you to turn, look in camera and say the lines.}
<A>__{bob wonders what she's leaving out, or if that's the way it works from japanese to english.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{that's all he said?}
<C>__{translator}
<D>__{yes, turn to camera.}
<A>__{bob thinks let's just get it over with.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{turn left or right?}
<A>__{the translator blots her face with a tissue, and asks the director in a japanese sentence 5 times as long. the director answers her in a long excited phrase.}
<C>__{translator}
<D>__{right side. and with intensity.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{is that everything? it seemed like he was saying a lot more.}
<A>__{the excited director says more in japanese. translator nods in understanding. bob doesn't really know what's going on.}
<C>__{translator}
<D>__{like an old friend, and into the camera.}
<C>__{director}
<P>__{(to bob))}
<D>__{suntory time!}
<A>__{they get ready, and roll camera: bob turns and looks suavely to the camera:}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{for relaxing times, make it suntory time.}
<A>__{the director yells something about ten sentences long. the translator nods.}
<C>__{translator}
<D>__{could you do it slower, and with more intensity?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{the translator answers for him in four sentences. on the monitor we see the next take: the moody lighting shines on bob, the camera gets closer as he stares into camera and gives them the line.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{for relaxing times, make it suntory time.}
