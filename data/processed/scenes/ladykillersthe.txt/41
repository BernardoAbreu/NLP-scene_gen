<L>__{interior munson living room night}
<A>__{othar looks serenely down from his spot over the mantelpiece. marva munson knits; g.h. dorr sits nodding over an ancient volume of half forgotten lore, reading glasses perched midway down his nose. curtains waft lazily in the summer night breeze.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{...you just a readin' fool, ain't you mr. dorr.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{yes yes, i must confess, madam, that often i feel more at home in these ancient volumes than i do in the hustle bustle of our modern world. to me, paradoxically, the literature of the so called "dead tongues" has more currency than this mornin's newspaper.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{mm mm.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{in these books...}
<A>__{he removes his glasses and lazily twirls them.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...in these volumes, there is the accum'lated wisdom a mankind which succours me when the day is hard or the night lonely and long.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{wisdom of mankind, what about the wisdom of the lord?}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{oh yes, the good book, mm. i have found reward in its pages. but for me there are other good books as well; the heavy volumes of antiquity, freighted with the insights of man's glorious age. and then of course i love, love, love the works of mr. ed g'allan poe.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{i know who he is. kinda creepy.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{oh no, madam, noooo. not of this world, true; he lived in a dream, an ancient dream...}
<A>__{dorr himself is lost in a dream:}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{"helen, they beauty is to me like those nicean barks a yore that gently, o'er a perfumed sea, the weary, wayworn wanderer bore to his own native shore... "}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{who was helen? she wasn't a loose woman, was she? some kinda whore a babylon?}
<A>__{dorr is still lost:}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{one doesn't know who helen was, though i picture her as bein' very, very extremely... pale.}
<A>__{he comes to himself, focuses on mrs. munson.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...miz munson, i was tryin' to think of some way of expressin' my gratitude to you for takin' in...}
<A>__{he chuckles.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...this weary, wayworn wanderer...}
<A>__{the professor takes a small ticket envelope from where it had served as bookmark, and hands it across.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...it's just a modest little ol' present, why it's practically nothing at all.}
<A>__{beaming, she takes two tickets out of the envelope and inspects them.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{oh mr. dorr, why you are such a gallant man...}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{oh no madam, i blush. i melt. no, i just happened to hear of this gospel concert tomorrow night, the mighty mighty clouds of joy, and i thought you and a friend from church, perhaps...}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{othar loved that music... yes, i got a widow lady friend...}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{the concert is up in memphis, but i have arranged for a car service to transport you thither and, needless to say, back home at the concert's termination. my friends and i will be rehearsing here tomorrow evening so you needn't worry about the security of your charming little old house...}
<A>__{there is a knock at the door.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{huh? excuse me.}
<A>__{i e. munson house foyer night mrs. munson swings the door open to sheriff wyner. his squad car is parked at the curb.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{sheriff wyner, how you doin'...}
