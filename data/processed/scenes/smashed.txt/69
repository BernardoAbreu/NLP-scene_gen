<C>__{kate}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{mrs. hannah shouldn't you be more fatter?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{`cause of the baby. my mom got real fat.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(taken off guard)}
<D>__{well..."shouldn't you be fatter?" is the correct way to ask that question.}
<A>__{kate goes back to the board clearly wanting to move on.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{now, one day when you're very old and wise fourth graders, you'll learn about multiplication and }
<C>__{isabel}
<D>__{mrs. hannah shouldn't you be more fat?}
<A>__{all the students look at kate. she's on the spot. flustered.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{well, i...}
<A>__{kate searches for something to say. anything. but then she blurts }
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{...i'm not going to have a baby.}
<C>__{class}
<D>__{oooh!}
<A>__{kate immediately looks like she wishes she could take it back.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{see i was pregnant but, it wasn't my time, i suppose...}
<A>__{another little girl winnie jumps in.}
<C>__{winnie}
<D>__{mrs. hannah did you kill the baby?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{what? no of course not!}
<C>__{winnie}
<D>__{`cause my mom says that when you kill a baby you go to hell and you can't even go to church to ask god for forgiveness.}
<A>__{the students begin to whisper to each other. another boy toby asks }
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{mrs. hannah are you going to hell?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{no! i didn't kill my baby! okay, listen kids we shouldn't be talking about this. but...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{...sometimes women get pregnant and then early on before it's even a baby they stop being pregnant.}
<C>__{winnie}
<D>__{because a doctor murders it!}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{no not because a doctor murdered it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's called a miscarriage. that means it wasn't my plan it's just what happened.}
<P>__{(composes herself)}
<D>__{does anyone want to ask me any questions?}
<A>__{the class nods but seems silently freaked out.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{let's get back to subtraction or addition. or both.}
