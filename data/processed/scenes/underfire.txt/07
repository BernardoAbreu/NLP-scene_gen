<L>__{exterior the rebel's airfield day}
<A>__{the convoy rumbles past a check point into a small airfield containing a motley collection of dc 3's and old planes. two russian advisors and three cuban advisors watch.}
<C>__{oates}
<D>__{well hell... i wonder where the fuckin' guvmint is?}
<A>__{as he speaks, the cab of the truck is rocked with a mortar shell and explodes. soldiers scramble to safety. some grab the guns being transported. two soldiers grab the stretcher of coke and start running for safety. smoke and explosions are everywhere they abandon their cargo and run for cover. oates scrambles to safe ground quickly and instinctively, looking around wildly to "read" the situation. price dives next to him. a soldier is hit and goes down nearby, staggering towards price and oates. a dc 3 goes up in flames in the background the wounded soldier reaches for oates who darts out quickly and drags the injured rebel to safety. price has his cameras out at once and is firing away. two rebel soldiers point to the stretcher of coca cola and start moving toward it through the smoke. they want to rescue the soft drinks. price leaps from his bunker and races toward them dangerously, waving and shouting as he does.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{hold it! hold it!}
<A>__{they don't speak english but stop at his craziness. price stops and aims his camera, and as he does he motions for the soldiers to continue. p.o.v. the framed image soldiers, smoke and coke in b.g. as the soldiers move toward the coke, price snaps picture after picture. a mortar explosion blows the coca cola to a million bits the two soldiers stop short several more steps and they would have been killed. price's intrusion has accidentally saved them. the two soldiers run toward safety, bewildered and scared. on the airfield the smoke clears and all is calm gradually the airfield comes back to life. several teams of medics run with stretchers from the hut and begin gathering bodies. rebel soldiers appear from every conceivable shelter and move across the field. oates emerges and meets price on the torn up runway amidst the rubble. they look around at the devastation.}

<D>__{you can walk to work from here.}

<D>__{my brother just got married.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{i don't know your brother.}
<A>__{suddenly, the distant roar of a jet. all the soldiers on the field scan the horizon; price looks up. the air raid siren goes off.}
<B>__{a jet dives out of the sky toward the airfield oates and the soldiers dive to cover}
<A>__{jet streaks overhead and, instead of rockets and bombs, it drops something else: the sky is filled with a million pieces of paper the jet pulls out and disappears. all is quiet again as the million papers flutter in the sky above the airfield. out of frustration a single soldier fires a couple of shots at the paper. price grabs a piece of paper out of the air. it is:}
<B>__{a picture of a swimming pool in front of a california house}
<A>__{he stares at the image and turns it over. there is writing on the backside in spanish and russian. he looks around. oates wanders over with a handful of the leaflets.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{oates}
<D>__{great shit, eh?}
<A>__{price tries to read the writing on the back as oates looks at a leaflet familiarly.}
<C>__{oates}
<D>__{u.s. gummint offers this house to any cuban pilot flying migs for the rebels who chooses to defect to america with a russian jet. we know they ain't gonna run off with no planes but the rebs don't they're scared. they start thinking about that swimming pool. damn near smell that chlorine. starts workin' on 'em, and pretty soon they don't let the cubies near a mig. use their own spook pilots and destroy their own air force in a week. guaran fuckin teed.}
