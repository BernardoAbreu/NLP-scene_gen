<A>__{rafkin descends the stairs. downstairs is a maze of narrow glass corridors. not much else. it's all very clean and sterile. not a spider web in the jointerior in fact, there's nothing alive down here. rafkin removes a pair of ghost glasses. slips them on. an audio piercing gains in volume with every step rafkin takes.}

<D>__{alright, you sick bastard, where'd you put my money?}
<A>__{as soon as rafkin reaches the bottom step, he's assaulted full force by the psychic waves around him.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{aaahh!!}
<A>__{he keels over and vomits. the assault becomes too much, he collapses against a wall. when he doubles over in pain... we reveal a ghost behind him in the glass. it's a teenager from the '50s, a high schooler in a letterman's coat, the victim of a horrific auto crash. he holds a baseball bat menacingly over his shoulder. rafkin, sensing its proximity, turns as the ghost swings the bat with all his might. instinctively rafkin leaps back, but the glass holding the ghost holds. with exception of the red symbols that explode across its surface, the barrier remains intact. but the ghost within is suddenly gone... rafkin lands with fright a few feet back up the hallway.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{sweet jesus... not you.}
<A>__{as he turns about him, another ghost launches out of the darkness at him, only to be stopped by the glass. it's an older, pilgrimess woman in stocks. rafkin's jolted by this vision. he's driven to the other side of the hallway. again, when he turns around, the ghost is gone. he turns to face the fat man and the little woman ghosts. this sends him flying. rafkin races back down the corridor in shock. soon he's lost in the underground maze of glass, confused by all the twists and turns. he finally reaches the foot of the stairs. and bolts up them...}
