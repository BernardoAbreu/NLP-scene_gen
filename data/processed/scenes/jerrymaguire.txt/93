<L>__{interior adjacent buffet room night}

<C>__{avery}
<D>__{i just heard.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{what do i do? how do i spin this?}
<C>__{avery}
<D>__{oh honey. it's spun.}
<A>__{she keeps moving, adding an extra snap to the packets.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{what did i do to you?}
<A>__{she is furious with his question. doesn't he know?}
<C>__{avery}
<D>__{it's all about you, isn't it? soothe me, save me, love me }
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{could you just stop moving?}
<C>__{avery}
<D>__{i have to finish my job }
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{everything's on the fucking run! everything }
<A>__{she stops. walks to him, framed by a bank of t.v. monitors.}
<C>__{avery}
<D>__{jerry. you and i are salespeople. we sell }
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{look, i don't want a }
<C>__{avery}
<D>__{it's not "love me." it's not "trust my handshake." it's make the sale. get it signed. there shouldn't be "confusion" about that.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{go ahead. jump right on into my nightmare. the water's warm.}
<C>__{avery}
<D>__{so honesty is outlawed here, i can't be honest?}
<A>__{she turns and exits again. he follows.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{tell you what i'd prefer loyalty..}
<C>__{avery}
<D>__{what was our deal when we first got together? brutal truth, remember?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{i think you added the "brutal."}
<A>__{she stops, slaps down another media packet. blows a troublesome piece of hair out of her face.}
<C>__{avery}
<D>__{jerry, there is a "sensitivity" thing that some people have. i don't have it. i don't cry at movies. i don't gush over babies. i don't start celebrating christmas five months early, and i don't tell a man who just screwed up both of our lives 'oh, poor baby.' that's me. for better or worse. but i do love you.}
<A>__{jerry looks at his fiancee. standing here, watching avery coldly clasping her media packs to her chest, she looks different to him.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{avery }
<A>__{she knows what's coming. she moves fast to avoid him.}
<C>__{avery}
<D>__{don't say it. we're both ragged out right now.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{ stop }
<A>__{she exits back into the main ballroom. for a moment, she stops. they face off. this is it. they are quickly interrupted by overweight, talk show voiced curtis weintraub,}
<C>__{curtis weintraub}
<D>__{hey! curtis weintraub from the sports popper! haven't seen you two since the cuervo gold rock 'n sock charity six flags budfest! hello!}
<A>__{neither look at him, they remain fixed on each other. curtis gets a whiff of what he walked into.}
<C>__{curtis weintraub}
<P>__{(continuing; exiting quickly)}
<D>__{goodbye!}
<C>__{avery}
<D>__{i'm warning you. don't say it. you won't have another chance.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{listen to me!}
<C>__{avery}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{it's over }
<A>__{she continues moving into the next room.}
<C>__{avery}
<D>__{didn't hear it.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{there is something missing here.}
<C>__{avery}
<D>__{you've never been alone and you can't be alone }
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{listen to me, it's over.}
<A>__{she can barely believe it. she blinks.}
<C>__{avery}
<D>__{no one has ever dumped me.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{i'm not trying to make history.}
<C>__{avery}
<D>__{i did the 23 hour nose route to the top of el capitan in 6 hours! i can make this work.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(it slips out)}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{she takes a breath. it sinks in. from somewhere, the small voice of her vulnerability.}
<C>__{avery}
<D>__{oh jerry.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(steps closer)}
<D>__{you know i didn't ever want to hurt you.}
<A>__{she gets an odd look, shaking her head. starts to step away, then thinks better of it. she wallops him in the face with the back of her hand. jerry stands like a woozy boxer. she hits him again with a fist, then again in the chest. he sinks to the floor, sagging. backwards. she straddles him, addresses him fully, right in his bruised face.}
<C>__{avery}
<D>__{i won't let you hurt me, jerry. i'm too strong for you. loser.}
