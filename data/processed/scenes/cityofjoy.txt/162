<L>__{interior room night}
<A>__{mr. ghosh and the uncles stare at hasari, who stands politely and hopefully before them.}
<C>__{mr. ghosh }
<D>__{you're a rickshaw puller, am i correct?}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{yes, that's correct.}
<A>__{he looks at his brothers, on either side. they look at him.}
<C>__{mr. ghosh}
<D>__{and i a partner in the workshop where your daughter is employed. were you aware of that?}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{yes, yes, i was, my daughter told me, thank you.}
<C>__{mr. ghosh}
<D>__{yes, well then, perhaps you can tell me why i would permit my son to marry your daughter.}
<A>__{mr. ghosh raises his palms. it's all over as far as he's concerned.}
<D>__{uncle #1 just a moment, please.}
<A>__{the brothers huddle, whisper just loudly enough for hasari to hear.}
<D>__{uncle #1 are you saying there's no way you'd consider this match?}
<A>__{mr. ghosh shakes his head, shrugs his palms.}
<D>__{uncle #1 perhaps some inducement? would that be of any help?}
<C>__{mr. ghosh}
<P>__{(considering this)}
<D>__{what could he possibly offer? uncle #1 probably nothing. but perhaps, in fairness, we should find out.}
<A>__{mr. ghosh shrugs. the huddle breaks. all five men stare at hasari.}
