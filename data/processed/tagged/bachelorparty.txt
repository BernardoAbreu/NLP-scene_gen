<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{sorry, sister mary francis.}
<A>__{sister mary francis checks her watch. she scowls and looks out past the parking lot gate. suddenly we hear the sound of an engine roaring at full throttle. there is a screeching of brakes, followed by the loud grinding of gears. it sounds like the indy 500 is taking place around the corner.}

<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{zooming through the parking lot gates is a large yellow school bus. it practically takes the last turn on just two wheels. the bus driver quickly slams on the brakes, leaving ten feet of rubber behind him as the bus comes to an ear splitting halt right in front of them. the front door immediately swings open and rick stahl, the driver, hops out. rick is the life of the party, even when there isn't any party going on. while chronologically older than the st. luke students, the only thing that sets him apart from them is that he has a driver's license. rick figures he'll live up to his capabilities and get serious in his next life... this incarnation's strictly for laughs. sister mary francis steps up to him.}
<C>__{sister mary francis}
<D>__{you're late again, rick.}

<D>__{all right, stop that... children, on the bus.}
<A>__{the kids obediently file past rick, who makes like he is drying his tears with his handkerchief.}

<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{roberto, you finished fixing that lighter yet?}

<D>__{manuel, be sure and finish up the electrical system on that chevy.}
<A>__{manuel waves at chulo, who turns, hops on the bus. rick starts it up and starts to drive away. just as the bus clears frame, we see manuel connect two wires together at the same moment the guy with the hose washes down the area around his feet. manuel lights up like a christmas tree, screaming in pain. there is a beat, and then robert falls into frame, still holding the cigarette lighter, and the car raul is driving enters the lot and smashes into the side of the garage.}
<L>__{interior office building day}
<A>__{a sign on an office door says "concert ticket agency." from inside we hear someone talking loudly on the phone. chulo, rick and o'neill open the door and go inside. on the walls in the cramped office there are rock 'n' roll concert posters advertising rock bands like men at work, the clash and barry manilow. behind a cluttered desk we find a little man with a thin mustache and horn rimmed glasses. this is gary melnitz, wheeler dealer, entrepreneur and coward. gary yells a lot, which is a definite overcompensation for his size and inability to deal with the opposite sex.}
<C>__{gary}
<P>__{(yelling; into phone)}

<A>__{she floats off again... one of the young male customers approaches an attractive salesgirl. this is debbie thomerson, rick's intended. she seems to be the only sane employee in the place because she's actually working, putting clothes on the racks. this impression of sanity fits her, as she is level headed, and has a clear sense of herself. she can also take a joke, thus her engagement to rick.}

<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{right over here.}

<A>__{all the guests turn away in disgust. stan takes out a handkerchief and hands it to rick, who closes his eyes and picks up the warm little bundle. the manager turns and walks off in a huff. on the way back to the elevator, rick checks to see no one is watching and places the handkerchief's contents on the front desk, just out of frame. smiling contentedly, the guys lead the reluctant "moose" into the elevator. the doors slam shut.}

<A>__{the manager is just finishing checking in a couple from out of town.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{i will have the boy take your bags up.}

<D>__{excuse me. i seem to have a hand full of potty.}

<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(nearly hysterical)}

<D>__{gentlemen... ladies... for your viewing pleasure, meet mike the magical sexual mule.}
<A>__{o'neill lifts the head off the moose costume, revealing a real burro. the burro shows all his teeth as burros are apt to do when excited. o'neill and stan zip off the rest of his costume, revealing a well endowed beast.}

<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{how about this, a trojan donkey.}
<C>__{o'neill}
<D>__{and here's mike's partner, in more ways than one. a gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. the very lovely, miss desiree...}
<A>__{desiree, an erotic, tall woman wearing a leather face mask, comes out of the bedroom carrying a long whip. desiree puts ravel's "bolero" on the phonograph; then she starts to sway her hips sensuously in front of the animal. angle the party guests they all scream and holler approval. angle desiree she rubs up against the donkey, shaking her backside against the animal's.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{swell. she's gonna pin her tail on the donkey.}
<A>__{now all eyes are on desiree as she does an erotic striptease. angle the donkey it is getting bored and a little hungry. it bends its head to the left and spots the table with food on it. it bends over and starts munching on some cole slaw. angle desiree to the catcalls of the partygoers, desiree is getting all worked up, stripping down to a g string.}
<B>__{the donkey}
<A>__{it's had enough cole slaw. now it sniffs at larry's drug smorgasbord and then starts to chomp on a few pills. next it sticks its head into the lines of coke and snorts them up in one gigantic sniff. angle desiree she lets her long, flowing hair hang down over her breasts. then she takes a mattress and sets it on the floor. she rolls on it and sways her hips sensuously on her knees. angle her audience rick can't believe he's seeing this. the other guys are screaming at the top of their lungs. even larry seems spell bound. angle the donkey it doesn't look so hot as it finishes off every drug on the table. angle desiree she moves over to the donkey, hits him on the side gently with her whip, then pulls him over to her mattress. the donkey's blood shot eyes are the size of saucers. once again he shows his teeth in a kind of shit eating grin. desiree drops to the mattress and beckons the animal to her. mike the donkey obediently does as he's told, moving to her in a trance like, very turned on state.}
<C>__{desiree}
<D>__{c'mon, mike... come to mama.}
<A>__{the donkey takes another step forward, and then suddenly rears up on his hind legs, snorting. he starts bucking wildly. the crowd moves out of his way as the animal goes berserk for a few seconds, then without warning collapses in a heap on the floor. everyone goes rushing up to it. chulo and laverne enter the room, followed by several of the other contestants and others from the beauty pageant.}
<C>__{chulo}
<P>__{(excited)}

<A>__{mr. thomerson, in the bedroom, picks up the receiver. as he does so, a cloud of cocaine falls out of the mouthpiece. he screams at rick, gesturing with the phone in his hand as he dials. each move produces a large cloud of powder, which causes him to sniffle slightly.}
<C>__{mr. thomerson}
<D>__{i never liked you. i've never liked any of your friends. i've hated you from the first time i saw you. and now you are out of my life. you are out of my life!}
<A>__{he starts to react from inhaling the powder. he puts the receiver to his ear. he takes a deep breath and tries to dial another number. a large cloud of coke flies up his nose. he's stunned. he takes another deep drag. he's hooked. he forgets all about dialing. he jams the receiver against his nose and takes deep drag after deep drag. desiree, still wearing her leather mask, crosses to him and sits down next to him on the bed. he gives her a big, wide smile. o'neill closes the door.}

<A>__{the patrons are wearing their 3d glasses, watching the action on the screen. on the movie screen we see a man and a woman arguing. cole and debbie enter the theater. they run down to the front of the screen, heading for an exit. rick enters. he gives chase and catches up with cole. he takes a swing at cole and cole swings back. behind them on the screen a man has come to the rescue of the woman. a fight starts in the movie, also. the patrons sit calmly watching the action. miraculously, rick's fight with cole is in perfect sync with the actors in the movie. rick hits cole with a punch that sends him backwards into several movie patrons. the patrons are impressed by the realism of the film's special effects. cole throws a punch. rick ducks. the punch hits a man in the front row in the mouth.}
<C>__{man}

<D>__{gee, what a realistic effect.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{yeah, like you're in the movie with them.}
<A>__{rick climbs over several rows and continues to pummel cole. cole grabs a woman's purse and begins to hit rick with it. cole runs out of the aisle as rick climbs over people and dives onto cole, knocking him to the aisle.}

<A>__{it's another gorgeous day on the bluff overlooking the ocean. just right for rick and debbie's wedding. we see the wedding in progress. the area is adorned with flowers. the many guests are seated and taken in the moment. among these are tracey, desiree and gary's she man, who waves to gary as he stands with the other ushers, chulo, ryko and larry. chulo is choked up and trying to hide his tears. he looks over at laverne, who smiles to him.}

<C>__{rick}
<D>__{cheese. i love you more than cheese. and i love cheese a lot.}
<C>__{thomersons}
<D>__{they hide their faces in their hands. off in the distance a storm is coming in fast over the ocean. the wind begins to pick up. undaunted, rick continues his soliloquy.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{in fact, more than dairy products in general. i love dairy. my love is cream. pour me on the cereal of your life...}
<A>__{now it starts to rain.}

<A>__{he wants this to end. he calls softly to rick, trying to get his attention.}
<C>__{father falwell}
<D>__{rick. rick. hey...}
<A>__{people begin to scurry for cover. in the b.g., under a tree, we see larry and his wife huddled in each other's arms. from the way they look, they have worked things out.}
<B>__{rick}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{i think this song pretty much sums up the way i feel at this moment.}
