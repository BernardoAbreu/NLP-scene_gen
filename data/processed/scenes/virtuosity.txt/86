<A>__{madison screeches the vehicle to a halt. she comes within inches of mowing down several people. madison and parker bolt to the entrance, flashing their badges to the guards.}
<B>__{inside the hollywood bowl}
<A>__{the guest conductor's movements grow even more intense. more demanding. as he looks to the violin section, we now see the conductor's face. it is sid 6.7.}
<C>__{sid 6.7}
<P>__{(silently)}
<D>__{don't hold back...give it to me. give it to me!}
<A>__{the orchestra plays with everything they've got. they hit every note perfectly. including a high c. on the conductor's podium the first sensor is triggered. then the second.}
<B>__{parker and madison}
<A>__{appear at the back of the stage. guns raised. distracting the musicians. as parker and madison charge through the horn section toward sid 6.7, the musicians stop playing. on the conductor's podium the fifth sensor is triggered. then the sixth...but not the seventh. sid 6.7 cannot believe his eyes. or his ears. the entire orchestra has stopped.}
<C>__{sid 6.7}
<D>__{come on, play! play!}
<A>__{in his rage, his face contorts "past points", which can only be described bizarre, frightening, and not, something you would ever like to see when you look in the mirror. the musicians stare at sid 6.7, and then at parker and madison with concerned, confused silence. which is broken by parker's gunfire. ducking behind the podium, sid 6.7 desperately tries to rewire the sensors to trigger manually. without luck. he takes his .38 out of his jacket and starts firing. pandemonium erupts throughout the hollywood bowl. audience members run in every direction. the members of the orchestra bolt for their very lives, but keep their instruments with them. even the oboist. preventing parker and madison from taking any further shots at sid 6.7. sid 6.7 bolts down into the crowd. madison cannot get off a clean shot. neither can parker. he aims, but does not fire. he and madison struggle through the crowd after him.}
<B>__{outside the hollywood bowl}
<A>__{parker and madison just catch a glimpse of sid 6.7 as he rushes up the entrance ramp to the hollywood freeway. parker and madison bolt after him.}
<B>__{on the hollywood freeway}
<A>__{parker and madison race past the cars waiting to merge into what is effectively a parking lot. as is normal for this thoroughfare, traffic is at a standstill. sid 6.7 is nowhere to be seen. parker and madison splitup, wading through different lanes of traffic. startling the already frustrated motorists. who roll up their windows. lock their doors. and some of whom reveal weapons of their own. madison pauses, listening. she has no idea that sid 6.7 steps behind her. wham! he cold cocks her with the butt of his gun. madison crumples to the street. which now leaves parker a clean shot at sid 6.7's head. boom! boom! two hits. two head wounds. sid 6.7 falls behind a truck, losing his weapon. before sid 6.7's wounds have finished regenerating, parker is already on top of him.}

<P>__{(neighborly)}
<D>__{hey, old buddy, old pal, good to see you again.}
<A>__{he empties his clip into sid 6.7, then discards the gun. as sid 6.7's wounds heal themselves, parker pounds him mercilessly.}

<D>__{now, is that any way to talk to an old friend?}
<C>__{sid 6.7}
<P>__{(exploding)}
<D>__{barnes, you're dead!}
<A>__{he knocks parker back with a good shot to the face, then disappears around a van. parker continues the hunt. quietly. carefully. tension grows in the silence that follows. he carefully makes his way around a truck. only to see sid}
