<A>__{jack sits in the saab's passenger side with the seat almost fully reclined. when his agony allows him to open his eyes, he glares at the danish themed stores lining the street. an abelskiver maker plies his lofty trade in a nearby window. he hears a strange clomping noise and turns his head to see a man in wooden clogs walking noisily down the street, dressed in a traditional danish costume and carrying a tuba. jack takes a slug of wine. just then miles gets back in the car.}

<A>__{miles opens the bottle and hands jack two pills.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{two for you. and two for me.}
