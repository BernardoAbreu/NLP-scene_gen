<L>__{interior the reception later night}
<A>__{claire in the thick of things a band playing now occasionally glancing at mike who stands against a wall, ever watchful... close on mike: turning to see a very pretty young thing come up to him; just "oozing" seduction.}
<C>__{pretty young thing}
<D>__{i hear you're a policeman.}
<A>__{mike nods; eyes fixed on claire.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{uh, yeah. i'm a policeman.}
<C>__{pretty young thing}
<D>__{ever shot anyone?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{pretty young thing}
<D>__{does it make you... hard?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{... hard?}
<C>__{pretty young thing}
<D>__{erect. you know, a "boner?" i'd heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man.}
<A>__{mike's eyes register abject dumbfoundment.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{would you excuse me, please?}
<A>__{he pushes toward claire, catching her eye.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{would you consider leaving here pretty soon?}
<A>__{claire relaxed, clearly having a good time.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{people think i'm stepping out on neil. we're causing quite a scandal.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(confidential)}
<D>__{hey! there are crazy people here.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{let's get a drink.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{ah... i shouldn't... on duty.}
<A>__{she plows toward the crowded bar, just inside the ballroom entrance, mike following.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i will have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... i must go for a pee.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i will come with you.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i think i can probably do that on my own.}
<A>__{close on mike: not amused. claire heads to the ladies' room across from the bar. mike watches her enter. turns back to the bar, which is very busy and confused.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{gimme a spritzer, and a... vodka martini.}
<A>__{mike seeing the pretty young thing.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{make it a double.}
