<L>__{exterior chateau night}
<A>__{while aramis and athos are visible through the window, arguing and gesturing, porthos still naked walks across the moonlit courtyard, to the barn.}
<L>__{interior dining room night}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{phillippe he's very bright, he's perceptive, but he is in such turmoil }
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{you grow fond of him. that's good.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{don't play god with me, aramis i }
<A>__{athos interrupts himself as he glimpses the naked porthos moving across the courtyard toward the barn.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{go on.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{but what is porthos doing?}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{going into the barn naked or so it appears.}
<A>__{we intercut p: orthos in the barn with aramis and athos in the house...}
<B>__{in the barn}
<A>__{porthos, alone within the barn, finds a thick plow rope and fashions a noose.}
<B>__{in the house}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{now. you were saying?}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{but what is he doing?}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{about to hang himself, i should think.}
<B>__{in the barn}
<A>__{porthos throws one end of the rope over the central beam of the barn, and ties the other end off. he shoves a milking stool up below the noose, climbs onto it, and fits the noose around his neck. note: when we see him in full view it is only from behind and this angle is a sight to behold.}
<B>__{in the house}
<A>__{aramis' detachment only aggravates athos' excitement.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{hang himself?!}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{he's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{we must stop him!}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{come now, athos, if porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{but but }
<A>__{athos jumps up and makes for the door but aramis' hooded helpers, at a signal from aramis, bar his way.}
<B>__{in the barn}
<A>__{porthos, grave with drama, utters his last words...}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{a'dieu, cruel life! farewell to useless porthos!}
<A>__{he steps off the stool. his great weight drops. the rope snaps taught. the beam it is tied to snaps like a twig right in the place where it has been sawn nearly in half already. porthos falls unencumbered and slams butt first into the floorboards of the barn, cracking them.}
<B>__{aramis and athos}
<A>__{can hear the crack from where they're sitting.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{i sawed the main beam in half.}
<B>__{in the barn}
<A>__{the chain reaction has just begun. the broken floorboards buckle, and the barn's walls, deprived of their central support, fall in on each other.}
<B>__{in the front room}
<A>__{athos and aramis watch wide eyed as the whole barn completely collapses around the unfortunate porthos. athos gives aramis a look.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{i'm a genius not an engineer!}
<A>__{they jump up and run out. the commotion draws others too especially the three wenches porthos had been trying to bed.}
<B>__{the collapsed barn}
<A>__{it's a tangle of debris and from the size and weight of the pile, it looks as if no one could live through the collapse. for a moment the whole pile lies silent; then suddenly it bursts apart and porthos emerges, exploding with anger.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{aramis!! you did this, didn't you! you knew i would try hanging myself, and you sawed the beam! admit it! admit it, by god!! admit it!!!}
<A>__{porthos' eyes are bulging; he's terrifying in his fury. and he holds one of the broken barn's timbers like a giant club, ready to bash in aramis' brains. aramis is totally casual.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{well of course i knew it, porthos.}
<A>__{porthos stands there, blinking.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{you've been moping for months. now that you've gotten the idea of killing yourself out of the way, you can stop boring me and start being useful to me. now get some rest.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{well... well... okay.}
<A>__{porthos starts back toward the house. then one of the serving girls, heading back inside, sees in one of the upper windows the face in the iron mask. she screams }
<C>__{wench}
<D>__{aaaaaahhhhhhh!}
<A>__{phillippe shies back from the window now, but it's too late, everyone has seen him. aramis, with cold intellectual curiosity, quietly observes the women's reaction, even as his hooded helpers scurry from the shadows to calm the frightened locals.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{poor phillippe!}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{the mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected. do you notice?}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{all i noticed was that phillippe feels even more like an animal.}
<A>__{athos hurries in; aramis looks at porthos.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{see, porthos secrets are hard to keep. we don't have much time.}
