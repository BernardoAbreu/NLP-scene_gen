<A>__{the officer nods and moves the barricade out of the way, reilly hits the gas, rumbles through. the studebaker swings past a fire truck, an ambulance, and two squads cars. two officers stand near a building with a worried businessman and his chauffeur. reilly parks 50 yards from a limo stopped in the middle of the street. a bomb squad van and sleek black harley davidson parked beyond it. reilly hops out, heads cautiously for the limo pooch, 50s, a barrel chested ex football player is on his hands and knees looking under the limo. red rubber ball in hand, hawaiian shirt half tucked in, he leads around an equally scruffy labrador retriever, schnoz.}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{smell anything, schnoz? me, neither.}
<A>__{t.j., 20s, a country boy inspects the open trunk. glass, 40s, clean cut, straight laced, easy going smile, brilliant leader of the team, steps lightly around the open driver's door.}

<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{shhh, i hear something....}

<P>__{(flashes badge)}
<D>__{reilly, vice. i }
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{quiet!}
<A>__{glass and pooch step lightly to the rear of the limo where t.j. has discovered a shoebox wedged next to the spare tire. t.j. leans down, puts his ear to it, nods.}
<C>__{t.j. }
<D>__{ticker.}
<A>__{pooch lifts up schnoz and holds him over the trunk. schnoz sniffs the shoebox, whines.}

<A>__{pooch lowers schnoz back to the ground throws him the red ball, and trots back to the van, climbs up inside and sits, watching.}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{alright boys, look close. let's assess.}
<A>__{glass, pooch and t.j. take a beat just to look at the shoebox. then, glass nods for reilly to move away. reilly takes a few steps back, watching as the team works together glass in charge a psychic connection between them as they pass tools back and forth like surgeons.}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{whadaya think, "boy" or "girl"?}
<A>__{glass puts on magnifying spectacles precise, organized, a detail freak as he uses a wooden probe to test the box for wires, sensors. as the others watch, glass rubs his fingertips ritualistically and carefully eases the top off the box. he reaches in... grabs something... slowly pulls it out ... it's a mickey mouse alarm clock doll, a clump of unlit firecrackers taped between mickey's legs. the bomb squaders whoop and howl all except pooch who pulls out a pack of tums, shoves half of it in his mouth.}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{it's a "girl" !}
<A>__{they all crack up, hysterical. reilly stares in disbelief these guys are nuts! moments later at the bomb squad van in the b.g., the officers finish getting a statement from the businessman as the still worried chauffeur inspects the limo. t.j. and pooch load their equipment into the van as glass fills out paperwork.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{that guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{no shit. i better send meg flowers just in case.}
<A>__{t.j. and pooch share a laugh as reilly approaches...}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{who's in charge here?}
<A>__{pooch points to schnoz.}

<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{make an appointment.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{it's about this.}
<A>__{reilly holds up the bracelet. glass takes it, frowns.}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{where did you get this?}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{off a girl's wrist. a suspect...}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{p.e.t.n ...}
<C>__{reilly}

<C>__{glass}
<D>__{high grade det cord. this girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<A>__{glass whips out a blasting cap from his utility belt, cuts off a piece of the bracelet, plugs it in.}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{fire in the hole!}
<A>__{glass tosses it into a sewer drain. a beat, then a small explosion, smoke billows out of the gutter drain. the nearby officers jump, alarmed. the bomb squad guys laugh. glass waves to the officers.}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{sorry about that.}
<P>__{(to reilly)}
<D>__{that's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{he grabs back the bracelet, turns to leave.}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{hey wait a minute }
<A>__{reilly jogs back to his studebaker, climbs in and roars off in a cloud of dirty smoke.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{vice... jesus.}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{that'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on.}
<A>__{pooch and t.j. share a laugh as glass shakes his head, climbs on his harley. the others pile into the van. glass kicks starts his hog and rumbles away, van following.}
