<L>__{interior picture gallery dusk}
<A>__{nell bursts into the picture gallery and stops. standing there are marrow, theo and luke, stricken silent by her entry. looks of shock on their faces. nell just stands there. a beat. and then it pours out of her, hysterical.}
<C>__{nell }
<D>__{he hunted all those children in here. the dead children, josiah and elizabeth and all of them... from the books... he took them up here... he played games... the ones from his mills he burned them up in the fireplace but she found out what he did and she killed him }
<A>__{she takes a breath, and turns gray. before anyone else can react, her legs go out from under her, and she lands sitting. theo and marrow get to her side fast.}
<C>__{nell }
<D>__{ he didn't kill her she killed him and ran away with her baby }
<A>__{marrow grabs her face. it's gray, her eyes glazing over.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{get a blanket!}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{it's okay... we're all here...}
<A>__{luke races out. theo, scared, looks at marrow.}
<C>__{theo }
<D>__{what's happening to her?}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{she's in shock. come on.}
<A>__{he starts to lift her. theo takes her other side.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{after rene... after she killed herself... he turned into a monster. he did fill the house with children... he did, but... they weren't laughing...}
<A>__{nell is ugly, sprawling, in shock, as theo and marrow shuffle her to a padded bench on one side of the room.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{nell, what happened?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed }
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{nell... please, nell... take a deep breath...}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{and they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!}
<A>__{marrow grabs her face.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{nell!}
<A>__{luke rushes in with a blanket. theo covers nell and then holds her, gently.}
<C>__{marrow }
<D>__{look at me, nell. look at me!}
<A>__{nell manages to focus on him, her breath laboring.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{hugh crain. he's in the house. he's still here...}
<A>__{theo pulls back, goes very still. the first hint of fear in her eyes.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{marrow sees the panic working on her, gives her a stern look:}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{theo! you too. listen to me.}
<A>__{the command derails theo's train of thought. marrow stares at nell in pity, can't bear it, and has to look away. finally he turns back to her, full of regret.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{nell, you have to hear me. let me explain what's happening to you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you're participating in a study on hysteria.}
<A>__{everyone but marrow reacts.}
<C>__{marrow }
<D>__{i've given you a powerful suggestion that you're in a haunted house. i picked hill house because it fits the expectations. it was my... it was my theater, my stage.}
<A>__{theo glances at luke: he's been right all along. this was never about perception.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{modelling small group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations. you brought us here to scare us. insomnia, that was just a decoy issue. you're disgusting.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{is this true? i've been hypnotized?}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{i hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance. mass hysteria is like a story, nell. a communal story. someone starts it. then we all add a little more to it. and then for some reason no one knows how we start believing it. this story shapes what we see and hear. we interpret everything through it, make it fit the story. i started our story when i gave you the history of hill house. you've added to it. that's what this experiment has all been about. that's what it was about, the experiment's over. i'm pulling the plug. this is my fault.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{it's not real? crain? he's not real?}
<A>__{marrow shoots him a look: shut up.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{your fear of him was real. that's all the ghost anyone needs.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{how could you do this to people?}
<A>__{nell bucks in his arms, furious, desperate.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{this is real, i'm not making it up! theo, you saw it! you were there the banging and last night. you, you all saw the painting!}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{nell, it makes sense. it all makes sense. you and i, we were scaring each other, working each other up.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{ but the painting!}
<A>__{nobody says anythlng. the silence tortures nell.}
<C>__{nell }
<D>__{i know you think i did that. i didn't! go to the great hall and look in the fireplace!}
<A>__{she starts to laugh. marrow gently presses nell down, tucking the blanket around her.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{why would we want to do that, nell?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{because that's where he burned them up, the child laborers from his mills! because that's where their bones are! he killed}
<A>__{hundreds . he took them here and}
<D>__{he killed them. their bones are in the fireplace!}
<A>__{nell sobs. the others exchange looks at this. it sounds so hollow, so delusional, it makes marrow look so right.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{there are no bones in the fireplace. luke and i looked in it yesterday. there's some old charred wood in the ash drop but }
<A>__{nell spasms trying to fight her way up, but marrow and luke hold her down. nell begins to wail in helpless rage.}
<C>__{marrow }
<D>__{nell! if we look in that fireplace it'll just make you more upset. and when there are no bones there, you'll say they got up and walked away.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{oh, god, you're not going to look...}
<A>__{theo pushes them back and grabs nell's hand, gently brushes nell's face.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{aw, shhh nell, shhh.}
<A>__{theo turns up to marrow, intense, furious with him. nell's hysterics have stopped. she stares up at him, lost. searching inside herself. maybe she is crazy...}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{there has to be monster in the labyrinth. we make them up. that's how we deal with the things in everyday life that are too terrible to deal with. like losing someone. like being alone.}
<A>__{marrow reaches down to nell, but she shrinks away. theo blocks marrow out, shielding nell. marrow pauses, disgusted with himself.}
<C>__{marrow }
<D>__{i'm sorry, nell. i'm really, really sorry i did this to you.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{sometimes saying you're sorry is just not enough.}
<A>__{a disgusted luke leaves the room.}
