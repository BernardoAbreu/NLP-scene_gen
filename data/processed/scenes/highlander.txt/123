<L>__{interior hidden room}
<A>__{brenna's expression changes to awe. the room is massive, a cross between a museum and an old attic. suits of armor, italian statuettes, czech ironworks, persian fetishes and a thousand other oddities from a hundred eras crowd the shelving and floor space. the room has the look of ownership, as if civilization had taken the time to keep a scrapbook.}

<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{sometimes i think it's just for something to do. a conquest to be the last. something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away. some thing to replace the love that can never work.}

<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{there are differences.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{you kill with your left hand?}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{i haven't killed _you_.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{is that a threat?}
<A>__{taupin moves very close.}
<C>__{taupin}
