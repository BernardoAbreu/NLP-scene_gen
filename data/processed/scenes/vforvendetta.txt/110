<D>__{welcome home, evey.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{you...}
<A>__{her mouth hangs open.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{you did this... to me.}
<A>__{evey's rail thin figure begins to shake.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{you did this to me!}
<A>__{she stumbles against the wall, unable to support herself.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{you you hit me and and cut my hair. it was you. it was just you all this time.}
<A>__{she doubles over, covering her face as she bursts into tears.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{you tortured me. you tortured me }
<A>__{evey looks up at him, body shivering as he quietly glides toward her.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{oh god, why?}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{because i love you, evey. because i wanted to set you free.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{love?}
<A>__{a look of horror twists her starved face.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{set me free? don't you realize?}
<A>__{slender fingers ball into fists.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{don't you realize what you did to me? you nearly drove me mad!}
<A>__{disgust and anger light up her eyes.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{i hate you.}
<A>__{her little, wiry body coils tight as she circles him.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{i hate you! set me free? you put me in a prison to set me free?!}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{you were already in a prison. you've been in a prison all your life.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{shut up! i don't want to hear it. i wasn't in a prison. i was happy! i was happy here }
<C>__{v}
<D>__{happiness is the most insidious prison of all, evey.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{that's warped! that's evil and it's wrong! what gives you the right to judge? who are you to say what's not good enough?!}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{you were born in a prison, evey. i didn't put you there. i just showed you the bars. you've been in a prison so long, you no longer believe there's an outside world.}
<A>__{she wheels away from him, covering her ears, trying to get away from his voice.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{shut up! you're mad! i don't want to hear it!}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{that's because you're afraid, evey. you're afraid because you can feel freedom closing in on you. you're afraid because freedom is terrifying.}
<A>__{evey falls, stumbling through the labyrinth of the shadow gallery.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{i can't feel anything! there's nothing left to feel! don't you understand?}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{don't back away from it, evey. part of you understands the truth even as part pretends not to.}
<A>__{she collapses, head pounding.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{woman, this is the most important moment in your life. don't run from it.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{i don't know what oh god i can't breathe }
<A>__{v couches next to her.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{good. you're almost there. go closer. feel the shape of it.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{what are you doing to me? i can't breathe }
<C>__{v}
<D>__{you were in a cell. they offered you a choice between the death of your principles and the death of your body.}
<A>__{he cradles her as she hyperventilates, tears streaming down her face.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{i feel i feel like i'm going to burst.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{you said you'd rather die. you faced the fear of your own death and you were calm. try to feel now what you felt then.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{oh god i felt }
<A>__{the mask hovers over her.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{like an angel }
<A>__{he squeezes her shuddering body.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{oh god, v, i'm so scared. what's happening to me?}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{the door of the cage is open, evey. all that you feel is the wind from outside. don't be afraid.}
<A>__{gently, he lifts her.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{try to walk. the lift will take us to the roof.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{the roof? outside?}
<A>__{he helps her to an open elevator.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{i i don't want to be blindfolded.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{no, evey. no more blindfolds.}
<A>__{the cage in the elevator rattles shut.}
