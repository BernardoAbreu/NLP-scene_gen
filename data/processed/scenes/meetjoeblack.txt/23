<L>__{interior dining room night}
<A>__{as a disturbed parrish approaches the table, he hears the voice once more:}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{what are you looking so provoked about? 'did you miss me?' it's a normal question. i missed you. but what do i get back? 'not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill '}
<A>__{parrish sits.}
<P>__{voice (v.o., cont'd)}
<D>__{' this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice'.}
<A>__{parrish is on the edge of his seat, struggling to hide his panic.}
<P>__{voice (v.o., cont'd)}
<D>__{i'm waiting outside.}
<A>__{the conversation swirls on around parrish, he is deaf to it:}
<C>__{allison}
<P>__{(to drew)}
<D>__{did you speak to the governor?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{he's coming.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{his wife?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{unfortunately. i sat between them at the bronx zoo benefit it was better than seconal.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{i'm waiting outside. won't someone come to the door?}
<A>__{parrish is in shock, still striving to gain control of himself. as coyle serves him, parrish turns to luisa:}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{is somebody waiting outside, luisa?}
<C>__{luisa}
<D>__{i didn't hear a ring, sir.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{please have a look }
<A>__{luisa goes as coyle continues serving.}
<C>__{allison}
<P>__{(to quince)}
<D>__{what about the mayor?}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{he said he would be there with bells on.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{good, maybe they'll drown him out.}
<A>__{parrish is still not hearing a word, preoccupied with the return of luisa.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{please don't be negative, drew, we have an acceptance list that would do the white house proud the secretary general of the un, the chairman of the fcc, nine senators, i don't know how many congressmen, and at least twelve of the fortune '500'.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{no jocks? a twenty game winner or a masters champion? someone i could talk to.}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{or would talk to me.}
<A>__{luisa returns to parrish as the others' conversation drones on:}
<C>__{luisa}
<D>__{you're right, mr. parrish. there was a gentleman at the door. he's waiting for you in the foyer.}
<A>__{parrish is stunned.}
<C>__{parrish}
<P>__{(after a moment)}
<D>__{show him into the library, tell him i will be right there.}
<A>__{parrish, spinning with anxiety, tries to summon up his courage to go as allison continues:}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{i've arranged for favors silver charm bracelets for the women, platinum keychains for the men all engraved 'w.p.' but now i'm thinking of scrubbing them, they seem so ordinary.}
<A>__{finally parrish rises from the table, starts out.}
<C>__{allison }
<D>__{are they ordinary? do they seem that way to you, daddy?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{uh i don't know. no uh i don't...}
<A>__{allison is about to press the point, but then drifts into disappointed silence as parrish leaves the room.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(to allison)}
<D>__{you're overthinking it }
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{i don't think they're ordinary. i love keychains.}
