<L>__{exterior rise above the tanis digs morning}
<A>__{indy and sallah are lying in classic shouting fashion at the top of the rise looking down on the tanis digs. down behind them, sallah's truck is parked with the three arab diggers.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{my god! they aren't kidding!}
<B>__{what he sees}
<A>__{the tanis digs are laid out below like a painting. trucks, bulldozers, arab workers and german supervisors are everywhere. the excavations themselves are extensive and somewhat random holes have been dug and then abandoned, foundations and passageways unearthed and then deserted. beyond the main digs, a crude airstrip has been created. sallah points to what appears to be a mound of dirt with a hole in it near the center of the activity.}

<D>__{there! that is the map room!}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{what time does the sun hit the map?}
<C>__{sallah}
<D>__{just after eight.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{we haven't got much time. where are the germans digging for the well of the souls?}
<A>__{sallah points out into the desert a short way beyond the main area of activity. the desert turns to sand dunes out there, the surface undulating into the distance. several trucks and men are out there and a bulldozer is lumbering noisily toward it.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{okay. let's go.}
