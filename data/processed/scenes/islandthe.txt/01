<L>__{interior nutrition plaza sector four day}
<A>__{satie's gymnopedie plays from overhead speakers. a glass wall looks out across a green mountain valley. the plaza, formed in curves of creamy ceramic tile, is divided into two service areas. male residents in line on one side, females on the other. both genders combine in the seating area. lincoln reaches the head of the line. he swipes his ethercuff o v e r a scanner. a nutrition clerk, a surly woman in uniform, eyes the readout on her screen }
<C>__{nutrition clerk}
<D>__{lincoln six echo... options are dried fruit, oatmeal or anything in bran.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{what? no bacon?}
<C>__{nutrition clerk}
<D>__{you got a sodium flag, pal now what's it going to be?}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{whatever.}
<A>__{he shrugs, disgruntled. the clerk taps her screen. turning to a row of chutes behind her, she collects a foil covered bowl and a drink can. lincoln, less than appetized, loads his tray with the oatmeal and juice breakfast. then he heads into the seating area. in the seating area, male and female residents sit eating and chatting happily. uniformed busboys intermix, clearing and wiping tables. a divide in this community now starts to become clear... the busboys, like the nutrition clerk, like all the service, maintenance, and administrative staff we'll see, have distinct uniforms but no facial marking. they are known as "outsiders". the "residents", like lincoln, have crosshatched scars on their upper left brows and ethercuffs o n their wrists. mostly caucasian, from mid twenties to mid sixties. there are no children here. we isolate a blonde mid 20's, fresh, bright eyes, a fragile beauty, a crosshatch of two verticals and one horizontal. her name is ester two alpha. seeing lincoln, she smiles and waves }
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{lincoln ! over here!}
<A>__{lincoln crosses, a little surprised to see her. pleasantly so.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{hello , stranger.}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{what? you don't recognize me?}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{it's just an expression, that's all.}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{you and your expressions, lincoln. now sit down and ask me where i've been.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<P>__{(sits , a spreading smile)}
<D>__{okay, ester. where have you been?}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{at the medical center. just for tests but they had me on liquid nutrition.}
<P>__{(forks a mouthful of eggs)}
<D>__{mmmmm. this is the first solid food i've had in a week.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{exciting.}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{that's not the exciting part. i got my first trimester report: happy, healthy and contaminant free... both of us.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{us?}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{my baby... it's in perfect condition. i just hope i can keep it that way. i still have six months to delivery.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{then you leave all this behind, huh?}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{why? will you miss me?}
<A>__{her eyes betray a flicker of something. it unsettles lincoln.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{i will miss your coffee. c'mon, i already burned up my quota.}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{okay. but this is the last time.}
<A>__{in a deliberate move, she drops her napkin on the floor. as she ducks down to retrieve it, lincoln steals a gulp of her coffee. rising again, ester registers his souring look.}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{lincoln just nods across the plaza. ambient conversation is now ebbing at an arrival. an outsider in a grey, vaguely clerical uniform sanguine, settled, precise eyes. he might be a prison warden but for the generally warm reception. he is known as the community director. his name is merrick. he crosses to a lectern, unlooping a chain from his neck with a three forked pendant known as a "tri key". he slots the tri key into the lectern. the glass wall frosts over and pixellates i n t o a live feed of himself. now amplified by the plaza speakers, merrick begins his address }
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{good morning. to everyone here and everyone watching on etherscreen, welcome to the community address. today i'm coming to you from sector four. for those of you here with sugar quotas, let me recommend the french toast. i just tried some and it's excellent, really. but i know what everyone's hungry for s o let's move on to the lottery. as always the draw will be made from our host sector. so tell me, sector four is everyone ready for the daily spin?}
<A>__{applause and whistles erupt, mostly from the younger residents, who take on the zeal of a game show audience. the older ones including lincoln greet the prospect with labored tolerance. merrick turns the tri key i n the lectern. the glass wall switches from the live feed to a jumbotron o f flashing text; daily spin!... get ready to win!... daily spin! }
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{let the spin begin.}
<A>__{to a burst of cheers, he turns the tri key another notch. the glass wall becomes a spinning blur, like a tumbler on a slot machine. but instead of icons, it clicks through names, each separated by a blank line from "adams one alpha" to "zucker three charlie" scrolling the entire population of sector four. as the spin slows, a pent silence falls. expectant eyes watch the names click through the p's, the q's, the r's, the s's and . . . spin win!... starkweather two delta... spin win! }
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{starkweather two delta! step up!}
<A>__{cheers and applause as everyone looks for the lucky recipient. the excitement abates as it becomes clear he's not among them.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{well , starkweather, if you're watching on etherscreen your time has come, my friend! you're moving out to the island!}
<P>__{(another burst of cheers)}
<D>__{and the rest of you, never lose hope; what do we know about the daily spin?}
<C>__{the younger residents}
<D>__{everyone gets to win!}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{an d tomorrow it could be you...}
<A>__{merrick steps down and departs. the plaza reverts to its former mood, dotted with murmurs of disappointment. lincoln scowls.}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{don't worry. your time will come.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{that's easy for you to say. your time's guaranteed. all you have is six months.}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{six months of mood swings, sore back and swollen feet. want to trade places?}
<C>__{lincoln}
<P>__{(scowl lifting)}
<D>__{give me some more of your coffee.}
