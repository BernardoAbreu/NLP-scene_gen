<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{at lisca bianca, a helicopter is hovering above the island and preparing to land. waiting for it to descend are claudia, the old man, the marshal and anna's father, just arrived from the mainland.}
<C>__{marshal}
<P>__{(to the old man)}
<D>__{... is it also true that you saw no boat around here at lisca between yesterday and this morning?}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{how many times do i have to tell you, marshal, that i was at panarea.}
<C>__{marshal}
<D>__{i believe you, i believe you... but i'm also certain that you're hiding something from me. i can see it written all over your face... and you know that i have never liked your face. and if you want to know something, that gentleman over there...}
<P>__{(indicating anna's father)}
<D>__{...who's a very important person... doesn't like it either. so, just keep that in mind. i will talk to you later.}
<A>__{the marshal moves away from the old man and goes over towards anna's father who is watching the helicopter come down.}
<C>__{anna's father}
<D>__{i presume by this method that you'll be able to uncover some new clue, either a handkerchief or an article of clothing... in other words, something which your men have not been able to find as yet.}
<C>__{marshal}
<D>__{without any doubt, sir. if anything belonging to the girl who has run away is still here on this island...}
<C>__{anna's father}
<P>__{(resentfully)}
<D>__{allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive.}
<C>__{marshal}
<D>__{i'm sorry, sir. i didn't mean to put it that way. but, you must understand, sir, that i...}
<C>__{anna's father}
<D>__{i understand very well. only i don't want any rash assumptions to be made.}
<A>__{one of the carabinieri appears with anna's valise which he sets down on the ground.}
<C>__{marshal}
<D>__{here's her valise, sir.}
<A>__{the helicopter is now a few feet above the ground, and everyone steps aside to allow it room to land. the rush of wind from the propeller sends up a cloud of dust, and finally the helicopter touches down. the propeller stops, the door opens, and out comes two large bloodhounds accompanied by a police attendant. he immediately says something to the dogs in german which suddenly creates an atmosphere of resentment among the group assembled there. anna's father goes to his daughter's valise, bends down, but doesn't dare to touch it.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{do you want me to open it?}
<C>__{anna's father}
<D>__{yes, please.}
<A>__{claudia opens the valise and starts pulling out several dresses, a few intimate garments, and several other items of clothing. as she continues rummaging, she suddenly comes upon two books, fitzgerald's tender is the night and a copy of the bible, which she hands to anna's father who, in turn, examines them with great care and deliberation.}
<C>__{anna's father}
<D>__{this looks to me like a good sign. don't you think so? as far as i'm concerned, anyone who reads the bible could not have committed an act of impropriety. why... as a matter of fact, i remember when i was in china, many years ago, i happened to be involved in a similar situation, concerning an english woman, the wife of ambassador shafford, a good friend of mine. there, too, we found a bible... and i said at the time that whatever had happened, that clue alone had definitely ruled out the possibility of... suicide. why, it was logical, i said, that whoever reads the bible believes in god and therefore...}
<P>__{(then, turning to claudia in an almost supplicating tone of voice)}
<D>__{no? you don't believe it? well, as a matter of fact, i was right... the woman was found two days later. it was a case of amnesia.}
<C>__{marshal}
<D>__{sir, if you have no objections, may we start the search?}
<A>__{anna's father turns around to look at the bloodhounds who are already sniffing the air for a scent and anxious to get on with the hunt. then he throws a quick glance at his daughter's valise once more, and with an air of disgust and irritation, walks off in a huff, followed by claudia.}
<C>__{attendant}
<P>__{(to the marshal)}
<D>__{get everybody out of the way...}
<C>__{marshal}
<D>__{okay. i will send them down to that part of the beach over there...}
<A>__{after they all have left the area, the attendant leads the two bloodhounds over to anna's valise, instructs them to pick up the scent, then takes them up to the very top of the island, where he subsequently unties them from his leash and sets them off. claudia and anna's father arrive on the beach where patrizia, giulia, corrado, raimondo and one of the sailors are seated on a pile of rocks. as the dogs begin running in different directions over the island, trying to track down the scent from anna's valise, the entire group remains silent, awaiting the outcome of the search. suddenly, the bloodhounds come racing down the slope, heading directly towards the beach where they are gathered, apparently hot on the trail of some familiar scent. to everybody's amazement, the dogs stop in front of claudia, jumping excitedly and barking at her as though they had found their prey. claudia is nonplussed and almost petrified with fear. she turns around and sees the others all staring at her. but she cannot understand why they are looking at her that way nor why the dogs have stopped right in front of her. then, as if struck by a sudden flash of memory, she touches her dress and cries out:}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{it's because of this... the dress... it's because of this dress. anna gave it to me yesterday, right after the swim.}
<A>__{completely relieved, claudia smiles and bends over to pet the dogs, as the attendant comes up to them and ties the leash back on to their necks. then he leads them away and heads once again upthe slope towards the top of the island. anna's father seems almost disillusioned by the negative results of the search. corrado also feels dissatisfied, and addressing himself to the marshal, says:}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{and what are we going to do now?}
<C>__{marshal}
<D>__{we'll try again.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{but is it really necessary? those two beasts... how absurd!}
<A>__{meanwhile, the patrol boat has returned and is pulling ashore. giulia is the first one to notice its arrival and she calls out to the others that sandro is back. then she goes over to where anna's father is standing.}
<C>__{giulia}
<D>__{sandro's here.}
<C>__{anna's father}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{i don't know him.}
<C>__{giulia}
<D>__{it seems to me that at a moment like this...}
<C>__{anna's father}
<D>__{i don't want to know him.}
<A>__{by this time, sandro has come ashore, followed by the carabiniere, and immediately goes up to claudia.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{claudia, listen ... claudia.}
<A>__{but claudia hardly looks at him, and seeing corrado approaching, she moves away from sandro.}
<C>__{corrado}
<P>__{(to sandro)}
<D>__{i didn't think you'd be back so early.}
<C>__{carabiniere}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{we didn't check the other islands, so...}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{and why didn't you go there?}
<C>__{carabiniere}
<P>__{(referring to sandro)}
<D>__{he wanted to come back.}
<A>__{the sailors have unloaded the crate of cigarettes from the patrol boat and the marshal is getting all the details from the carabiniere.}
<C>__{marshal}
<D>__{up until now those smugglers were operating only around the palermo area. this will be a nice surprise for the lieutenant in milazzo... call up headquarters. bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate.}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{so... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. could it be possible, then, that anna...?}
<C>__{marshal}
<P>__{(evading corrado's question and pursuing his own thoughts)}
<D>__{i wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... maybe right here at lisca.}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{i was saying... it might even be possible that anna had left with them.}
<C>__{marshal}
<D>__{but for what reason would she have wanted to go away?}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{listen, marshal... as for there being reasons for going away, anyone of us might have three thousand of them. so you can assume that she had them. what i want to know, is it possible that the smugglers might have taken her aboard?}
<C>__{marshal}
<D>__{i think it's possible.}
<C>__{a sailor}
<P>__{(calling from the patrol boat)}
<D>__{marshal!... headquarters is calling. they have an important message.}
<C>__{marshal}
<D>__{what is it about?}
<C>__{sailor}
<D>__{they've stopped a suspicious looking boat a few miles from here... yesterday afternoon. the crew has been taken to milazzo for questioning.}
<A>__{the marshal takes off for the patrol boat, and corrado goes over to anna's father.}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{did you hear that? what do you plan on doing?}
<C>__{anna's father}
<P>__{(resignedly)}
<D>__{we are in the hands of god.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{that's true...but in the meantime, as far as i'm concerned, it's absolutely necessary to go to milazzo.}
<P>__{(directly to anna's father)}
<D>__{i know that you have no desire to meet me, and i shall take pains not to impose myself upon you. but, besides you, i am the closest person to your daughter...}
<C>__{anna's father}
<D>__{however that may be, at this moment my daughter has more need of her father than of you.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{pardon me for being so frank, but there are certain things that a father especially a father like you cannot understand. so don't be stubborn. i'm coming with you.}
<A>__{as soon as he finishes saying this, sandro turns around and looks at claudia, as though he had just now realized that she was there listening to him. claudia goes to the gangplank and boards the yacht, disappearing into the cabin. having followed her with his gaze, sandro then turns to patrizia.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{patrizia, what are you going to do?}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{what do you want us to do? i don't know myself... but we'll do something.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{i will go and get my valise.}
<A>__{sandro goes aboard the yacht and enters the cabin. on the way to his room he meets claudia who has just changed clothes and is about to return ashore. they stare at each other for a moment without saying anything. but the intensity in claudia's look, mixed with fear and desire, is so overpowering that sandro takes her in his arms and kisses her. claudia immediately releases herself from his embrace, but for the moment it lasted, the kiss was full and passionate. then she turns and goes out on deck. sandro remains there, momentarily stunned, then picks up his valise and returns ashore. as claudia, followed by sandro, steps back on the beach, she is met by patrizia.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{we've decided to go to montaldo's place. in fact, ettore should already be there.}
<C>__{sandro}
<P>__{(intervening)}
<D>__{good. then i will meet you there.}
<A>__{he says this primarily for claudia's sake, hoping to catch her eye. but she keeps her head bowed low, and doesn't look up. after a moment of hesitation, sandro turns away and heads towards the small motorboat in which anna's father arrived from the mainland. and without saying another word, he climbs aboard. patrizia places her arm around claudia's waist and together they start walking towards the yacht. but upon reaching the foot of the gangplank, claudia stops.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{to do what?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{but aren't you tired? i can just about manage to stand on my feet!}
<P>__{(then turning around to look for raimondo, she calls out)}
<D>__{raimondo!}
<C>__{raimondo}
<D>__{here i am, patrizia. i'm always here.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{claudia isn't coming with us. will you please take care of her luggage? thanks.}
<A>__{raimondo goes aboard the yacht and returns with claudia's valise. he consigns it to one of the carabinieri who, in turn, takes it aboard the patrol boat. claudia follows him aboard. the marshal comes out of the radio room, steps ashore, then joins sandro and anna's father on the motorboat, while patrizia, giulia, corrado and raimondo go aboard the yacht.}
