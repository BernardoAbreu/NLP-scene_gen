<L>__{interior adam's house. living room later}
<A>__{adam and katie sit on the couch playing an ultra violent video game. katie is destroying adam.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{you know you are terrible at this?}
<A>__{adam is totally lost. he has zero sense of how to play.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i've never played before.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{this is your playstation.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{doesn't mean i play it. games these days today are so complicated.}
<P>__{(re: control)}
<C>__{adam }
<D>__{there's too many buttons. i can't keep track of what does what.}
<C>__{katie}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{perhaps you'd prefer something a little more simple. maybe a nice game of connect four or bingo.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{she has a sense of humor.}
<A>__{katie's face lights up. she's proud of herself for that one.}
<C>__{adam }
<D>__{duck hunt, now that was a game. you know why? one button.}
<A>__{katie laughs.}
<C>__{adam }
<D>__{you think i'm kidding. my dad and i used to have duck hunt tournaments. he was actually really good.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{until he had his stroke.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{that must have been hard, seeing him lose his cognitive skills like that.}
<A>__{this is the most emotionally honest we've ever seen adam.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{well the funny thing is that the stroke actually made him a better player, he just lost interest.}
<A>__{katie feels for adam.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{you've never talked about your dad.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{well whose fault is that? doctor?}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{the two continue to play. adam wildly pushes every button as katie's character pins adam's character and repeatedly slams his head into the ground. game over. katie pats adam on the shoulder.}
<C>__{katie }
<D>__{rematch?}
