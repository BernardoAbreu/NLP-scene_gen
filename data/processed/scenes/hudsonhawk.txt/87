<A>__{hawk yanks his hand from the shredder and grabs the meg lomaniac by the hair and shoves his head down on the arm rest. hawk turns on the piercing siren and darwin's eyes try to escape his head with a high pitched scream. darwin's entire body bucks wildly. darwin back elbows hawk and moves down for his gun. hawk pulls him back by his hair, grabs him by the balls, and pushes him upward through the sunroof.}

<D>__{god damnit, i only wanted to destroy the world in my own image. i'm a regular joe...}
<A>__{darwin pounds his fists on hawk's head as hawk hits the sunroof switch sliding it shut on darwin, pinning his arms below the roof, but leaving his torso twisting in the wind. the mural of a happy lenin with his arms outstretched looms ahead waiting to greet darwin. putting two and two together, darwin loses it....}

<D>__{not lenin, anybody but lenin. god, let's talk abut this.}
<A>__{the limousine charges through the double doors and darwin's body connects with the mural.}

<A>__{hearing the crunch, hawk flips into the front seat and brakes the vehicle. alfred's head bounces against the steering wheel. hawk reaches over with a grin and picks up the da vinci model. he looks to alfred, kaplan crunched in the windshield, and darwin's dangling legs.}

<D>__{oh, honey....}
<A>__{hawk looks to alex, sitting on the stairs, the same way he left him. hawk rushes to him.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{we did it man, we...}
<A>__{hawk grabs alex's shoulder. alex falls back. written over his face in red lipstick is really dead. engaging a slow motion sequence, minerva saunters behind anna, putting on red lipstick. minerva slams her back to the ground. hawk howls then turns to see stiff upper lip alfred, bleeding from the neck. hawk tries to throw a punch, but alfred blocks it and crunches him across the face. the da vinci helicopter model bounces down the stairs in slow motion and cracks open, revealing the intricate mirror of the opening scene.}
