<L>__{interior courtroom day}
<A>__{moran fidgets on the stand.}
<C>__{nels }
<D>__{no sign of a struggle, you say.}
<A>__{see him now. nels gudmundsson, attorney for kabuo miyamoto, stands beside his impassive client. nels is 79, blind in his left eye, a little shaky. his body is winding down.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{well, the coffee cup was layin' right in the middle of the floor, like i said. and with a fella so neat as carl, that did seem peculiar.}
<A>__{and nels begins to walk toward him. limping, as he comes.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{as peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a single overturned cup in its wake?}
<C>__{hooks }
<D>__{objection, asking the witness to speculate.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{my gosh, alvin, was i supposed to object every time you did that?}
<A>__{a real. friendly smile.}
<C>__{judge }
<D>__{that's quite enough horseplay, nels, why don't you act your age?}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{if i did that your honor, i'd be dead.}
<A>__{some gentle laughter. judge fielding doesn't even bother to look annoyed.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{any more homely loveable tricks, and you'll be worse than that. proceed, gentlemen.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{there's an objection, your h...}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{and it's overruled, answer the question. if you can recall it.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{maybe the assailant straightened the cabin. and forgot the cup.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{right. in the middle. of the floor.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{maybe.}
<A>__{nels nods to himself, as if considering that. so that the jury will do the same.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{i think you testified all the lights were on. cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{and yet you started the engine right up. with all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge. did that strike you odd?}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{didn't think about it at the time. so no, it didn't strike me odd.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{does it now?}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{a little. yes. you have to wonder.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{you have to wonder.}
<A>__{and lets that sit. scratches his neck.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{you found three batteries, you say. a d 6 and d 8 in the well. and a spare d 8 on the cabin floor. correct?}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{it is.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{now i did some measuring down at the chandlery. a d 6 is one inch wider than a d 8. it would be too large for the deceased's well.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{he's done some on the spot refit ting. you could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the d 6.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{but he had a spare d 6, you said. right there. why not use that?}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{it was dead. we had it tested. maybe the d 6 was the spare and he had to use it.}
<A>__{ah.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{maybe he carried a spare that was too large to fit. so he'd have to bang out the flange to squeeze it in?}
<A>__{no answer to that. the silence rests.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on defendant's boat?}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{two d 6's. that's the kind his well was fitted for.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{no spare.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{so the defendant went out fishing for the night with no spare battery, hmmn?}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{apparently.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{i'm curious. the d 6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{i believe so.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.}
<A>__{stops. thinking.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{you don't. think so.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{he was heavy, but we were real careful. but i don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{you don't. remember .}
<A>__{and clears his throat.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it possible . possible that he struck his head after death. possible?}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{possible. but not darn likely.}
<C>__{nels }
<D>__{no further questions.}
<A>__{and limps back to the defendant's table. where kabuo miyamoto sits watching him.}
