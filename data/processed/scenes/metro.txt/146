<A>__{a veteran wearing green fatigue is dangling another wheelchair bound vet over the edge. fourteen floors up. the two front wheels are literally hanging out there in space.}

<P>__{(rambling incoherently)}
<D>__{i can't fight this technology. they have microprocessors made in totally sterile environments. i've seen those places. everyone is dressed in white. it's like paper clothing, man. they're not even human.}

<D>__{vet #2 dave, don't do this, bro. pull me in. we'll do a few laps in the park and figure out some other way.}
<A>__{but he's not getting through to his friend.}
<D>__{vet #1 i can't help this, man. do you have any idea what those microchips look like? how small they are when they put them in your brain?}
