<A>__{close on carolyn's eyes, reflected in the rear view mirror. she turns her head to look out the window: her pov: the red door of the burnham house stands out, even in the pouring rain.}

<A>__{angela, once again fully clothed, sits at the kitchen counter. she's eating a turkey sandwich.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{wow. i was starving.}
<A>__{lester puts a jar of mayonnaise back in the refrigerator.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{do you want me to make you another one?}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{no, no, no. i'm fine.}

<P>__{(concerned)}
<D>__{you sure?}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{i mean, i'm still a little weirded out, but...}

<A>__{a long beat, as lester studies her, then:}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{how's jane?}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{i mean, how's her life? is she happy? is she miserable? i'd really like to know, and she'd die before she'd ever tell me about it.}
<A>__{angela shifts uncomfortably.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{she's... she's really happy. she thinks she's in love.}
<A>__{angela rolls her eyes at how silly this notion is.}

<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{good for her.}
<A>__{an awkward beat.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{how are you?}

<P>__{(smiles, taken aback)}
<D>__{god, it's been a long time since anybody asked me that.}

<D>__{i'm great.}
<A>__{they just sit there, smiling at each other, then:}
<C>__{angela}
<P>__{(suddenly)}
<D>__{i've gotta go to the bathroom.}
<A>__{she crosses off. lester watches her go, then stands there wondering why he should suddenly feel so content.}
<C>__{lester}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i'm great.}
<A>__{something at the edge of the counter catches his eye, and he reaches for... close on a framed photograph as he picks it up: it's the photo we saw earlier of him, carolyn and jane, taken several years ago at an amusement park. it's startling how happy they look. lester crosses to the kitchen table, where he sits and studies the photo. he suddenly seems older, more mature... and then he smiles: the deep, satisfied smile of a man who just now understands the punch line of a joke he heard long ago...}

<D>__{man oh man...}

<D>__{man oh man oh man...}
<A>__{after a beat, the barrel of a gun rises up behind his head, aimed at the base of his skull. angle on an arrangement of fresh cut roses in a vase on the opposite counter, deep crimson against the white tile wall. then a gunshot suddenly rings out, echoing unnaturally. instantly, the tile is sprayed with blood, the same deep crimson as the roses.}
