<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{also explains why he was so pissed this morning about being replaced by conners. he wanted to be the point so everything went according to plan.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{he doesn't need another reason to be pissed at me.}
<C>__{jenkins}
<D>__{what about motive? do we have one?}
<C>__{vincent}
