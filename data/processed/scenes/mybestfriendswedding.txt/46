<L>__{exterior wallace estate day}
<A>__{julianne climbs from her taxi. only slightly in awe, she sets off past the reflecting pool, which fronts a mansion of graceful stone and timber. it's a hike today, because the circular drives is clogged deep with bentleys, mercedes, and waiting limos, vying for space with a score of delivery vehicles of all kinds, maintenance trucks, catering and florist and food vans.}
<L>__{interior great room day}
<A>__{julianne escorted into an enormous room, where brunch is in progress for more than a hundred. she looks from the vaulted ceilings, to the frescoed walls, the inlaid floors, the massive pipe organ above the stone staircase, the oil portraits of scottish ancestors and their favorite dogs. isabelle has risen from the main table, and comes to her. all smiles. julianne is in the twilight zone. what are these people laughing about? do they still think there's a wedding?}
<C>__{isabelle}
<D>__{jules. we're so glad you slept in.}
<A>__{takes her arm graciously. this woman would make anne bancroft look coarse. as they walk...}
<C>__{isabelle}
<D>__{now, you have a choice. the idea is bride and groom shouldn't see each other on the magic day...}
<A>__{julianne looking all around. magic day it seems to be. where the bell is a bride or a groom?}
<C>__{isabelle}
<D>__{so michael stays put in the garden. kimmy stays in here...}
<A>__{pointing. there she is, obscured by a cluster of the appropriately fawning. she has the same hunted eyes and false, slightly manic smile julianne wore yesterday. this, at least, makes sense.}
<C>__{isabelle }
<D>__{... and the guests go back and forth. where will you start?}
<A>__{close on julianne. watching the brave, frightened bride.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{she looks tense.}
<C>__{isabelle}
<P>__{(o.s., calmly)}
<D>__{nerves. i would never have guessed.}
