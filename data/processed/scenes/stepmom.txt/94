<L>__{interior indoor riding ring twilight}
<A>__{huge indoor space. wood sided walls, dirt floor. high corrugated metal roof, with birds flying, roosting in rafters. a little girl, under the keen eye of her trainer, puts her mount through its paces. in the cold air, steam rises from the horse's body. it's late, no one else around. track now... ...down a walkway. toward the stables. a barn cat is crouched, stalking prey. we hear a soft voice, speaking. one we know...}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{it was like telling her...}
<A>__{see him now. standing awkwardly, against the side of a stall.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{...that i didn't love her anymore...}
<A>__{see the horse, still steaming. standing patiently.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{...if i could be sure i'd always stay.}
<A>__{circling the horse now, we see annabelle's back. she is slowly brushing out the sweat mark. where the saddle used to be. her movements are stiff, mechanical. the soft voice continues...}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{she said, 'this thing you call a partnership. the schedules, the chores, all the things we have to work out...'}
<A>__{our angle circling to see at last annabelle's face...}
<C>__{luke }
<P>__{(softer)}
<D>__{'...for the kids.'}
<A>__{the tears that stand in her eyes. the set line of her small mouth.}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{'...that's the life i dreamed of. and it's all i ever wanted it to be.'}
<A>__{she swallows. because she will not cry.}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{that's the kind of person your mom is. she's the best.}
<A>__{annabelle says nothing. she drops to her knees. begins to clean out one of her horse's hooves with a metal pick. the only sound against the stillness. and her father watches. his heart pounding.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i complained a lot, baby. we couldn't travel, we'd lost our privacy, our chance to do things on the spur of the moment. to live for...ourselves. the way we'd started out.}
<A>__{he goes to her. the sound of his feet on the straw.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{and she said. sounds like you'd be happier. if the kids weren't around.}
<A>__{crouches down. very close to his child.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i said. i love them more than anything. but sometimes... i do miss what i've lost.}
<A>__{annabelle stops working. turns her faces away.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{she said she could never feel that way, not for one single second.}
<A>__{so he leans closer.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{she didn't want to be with someone. who could.}
<A>__{silence. he's staring at the back of her head.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you know, this horse smells really bad.}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{there's worse things.}
<A>__{at least she can talk. if only just above a whisper.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{do you know why i never told you all this before?}
<A>__{a beat. she doesn't look at him.}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{sure. you wanted me to blame her. instead of you.}
<A>__{waiting to hear...}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(very softly)}
<D>__{that's right.}
<A>__{she hears honesty. and heartbreak. it makes her turn...}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{how come you're telling me now?}
<A>__{he gets lost. looking in those eyes.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i don't want to be wrong anymore.}
<A>__{i don't.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i want to say i'm sorry, because i am. and let you hate me. if you have to.}
<A>__{she swallows hard. her eyes moving over his face.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{see that feeling? where you feel two different things at once? that's a grown up thing. it's not a lot of fun.}
<A>__{she shakes her head very slightly. and her eyes water.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{know why your mom never told you?}
<A>__{she doesn't.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{she knew that you and her were so...solid. nothing could rock that. but she didn't want to risk...}
<A>__{the hardest thing. he's ever had to say...}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{...your hating me.}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{cos she loves you.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{cos she loves you . she wanted you to have a daddy to love. even if he didn't...completely...deserve it.}
<A>__{now the tears in his eyes. and she's watching that.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you know how much love that is? that she has for you.}
<A>__{do you.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{there's going to come a moment. when she'll really need you to give that back. and you're just the girl that can do it.}
<A>__{the way he says this. makes her ask...}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{now do i know when?}
<A>__{he reaches. first time. strokes her hair.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{that moment will come. and your heart is going to whisper, 'here it is'}
<A>__{winds his fingers. around her hand.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{and you'll come through.}
<A>__{she stares in his eyes. and dead straight.}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{if i miss it, daddy? you clue me in.}
<A>__{okay, he nods. that's a plan.}
