<L>__{interior engineering}
<A>__{there is a sudden explosion on the upper level. geordi and the other engineers rush to deal with it.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{get a stabilizer on that conduit.}
<L>__{interior bridge}
<A>__{riker suddenly gets an inspiration as the bridge is}
<B>__{rocked.}
<C>__{riker}
<P>__{(to data)}
<D>__{could we access the defective coil and trigger their cloak?}
<C>__{data}
<P>__{(considers)}
<D>__{perhaps.}
<P>__{(suddenly enthusiastic)}
<D>__{yes! if we sent a low level ionic pulse, it might reset the coil and engage the cloaking systems.}
<C>__{worf}
<P>__{(onto the idea)}
<D>__{as their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{right. and they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds.}
<P>__{(to data)}
<D>__{data, lock onto that plasma coil.}
<C>__{data}
<P>__{(confident)}
<D>__{no problem.}
<A>__{data goes to work.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{worf, prepare a spread of photon torpedoes. we'll have to hit them the instant they begin to cloak.}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{aye, sir.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{we're only going to get one shot at this. target their primary reactor. with any luck, their warp core should implode.}
<A>__{worf works.}
