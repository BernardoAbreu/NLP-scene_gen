<A>__{we tilt up from hank's headstone to an ornate mausoleum on an island in a lake. simone's coffin is ferried across a bridge by pallbearers from the studio. numerous mourners follow behind. viktor, elaine and a curiously dry eyed lainey walk behind the coffin.}

<D>__{can i see you later go away for the weekend?}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(horrified by the suggestion)}
<D>__{how can you bring that up at a time like this?}
<A>__{the coffin reaches the steps of the marble mausoleum. a priest, rabbi, and a buddhist monk turn to viktor. he nods and they start to carry the coffin towards the door. however, the coffin is suddenly stopped by a police officer. a second police officer begins to jimmy open the lid. the coffin lid is pulled back. inside is a life sized cardboard standee of simone from "eternity forever". the mourners gasp. everyone looks to viktor.}
