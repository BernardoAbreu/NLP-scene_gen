<L>__{interior hallway}
<A>__{grace returns to listen. this thing is like a seesaw battle of wills.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{come on, jake }
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{don't jake me boy! it's a big house. you probably didn't even make it out to the desert this afternoon...}
<L>__{interior living room}
<A>__{jake has come right up on bobby in a rage.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{...or did you just ply the afternoon away between my sheets putting your lips all over her, you little horndog...}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{what difference does it make if i slept with her? we're gonna kill her.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{you're right! i don't give a damn about her. but killing her's one thing. fucking her behind my back, that's another!}
<A>__{suddenly jake swings his arm, clipping bobby across the side of the head with the pistol and opening another bloody gash. bobby crumbles to his knees, crying out. jake suddenly grabs bobby by the hair, forcing his face back and smearing his lips with his own in a vengeful kiss. the blood from bobby's wound runs down to his lips and mixes with jake's lips.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{now you've tasted both of us!}
<A>__{he pulls back the hammer on the gun and levels it at bobby's head. bobby sees it coming, plays his last card on his knees.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{o.k.! i admit it! i fucked her! but it's her you have to worry about, not me ! she wants you dead , jake. she wants you dead and she wants your money.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{what are you babbling about?}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{think about it! how do you think i got in here? did you hear any glass break? did you hear a door splinter?}
