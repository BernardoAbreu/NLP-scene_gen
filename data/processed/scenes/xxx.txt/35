<A>__{we crane up to reveal a field of pot plants. there's a cocaine processing plant along the field's edge. the whole place looks exactly like a central american drug farm. narco terrorists run around with ak 47's. xander sneaks past equipment covered in camouflage netting. a squad of narcos runs by and xander makes his move. he rounds another pile of equipment and comes right into the headlights of a truck. narcos hop out and charge forward. xander raises his hands.}
