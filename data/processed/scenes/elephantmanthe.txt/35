<L>__{2 pinheads (male and female), the dwarf we saw earlier with}
<A>__{the plumed hat and the ark on a string, another male dwarf, a female midget, a lion faced man, and an armless wonder. the female pinhead reaches into the cage and pats merrick's head.}
<C>__{plumed dwarf}
<D>__{you alright?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{y y yes }
<C>__{plumed dwarf}
<D>__{want to come out?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{you're english.}
<C>__{plumed dwarf}
<D>__{of course! you want out?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{plumed dwarf}
<D>__{won't be a moment.}
<A>__{he looks to the lion faced man and speaks to him in a foreign tongue. the lion faced man unlatches the cage door. then, after further instruction, from the plumed dwarf, the freaks gently help merrick out of the cage, closing the door behind him. the dwarf speaks to the others again and the lion faced man and the armless wonder move to each side of merrick. the lion faced man pulls merrick's right arm over his shoulder. merrick puts his left arm around the armless wonder.}
<C>__{plumed dwarf}
<D>__{we've decided... you've got to get away from here...}
<A>__{he and the other dwarf light two lanterns and they begin to move off. the boy by the wagon has awakened. he sees the small caravan of freaks moving in the darkness, the light from the lanterns bobbing over the grass. his first instinct is to call for bytes, which he almost does, but then he thinks better of it. he rises and goes to where bytes threw merrick's stick and disguise. he nicks them up and goes to the small band of strangely shaped beings. they stop and watch him warily.}
<C>__{boy}
<P>__{(handing over the things)}
<D>__{here... you'll need these.}
<A>__{merrick looks the boy in the eye, and the boy holds his gaze.}
<C>__{plumed dwarf}
<D>__{good of you, mate.}
<C>__{boy}
<P>__{(to merrick)}
<D>__{good luck.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{but... but...}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{i will be alright.}
<A>__{the small band moves away through the wagons. the boy watches the lantern light receding in the darkness. he turns and looks to the wagon, the poster of the elephant man, and the dying fire. he moves to the fire quickly collecting a few blankets and belongings. then taking one last look at the garish poster just visible in the night, he runs off into the darkness.}
