<L>__{exterior countryside sunset}
<A>__{a serene landscape, mist collecting as the red ball of a sun dips behind the mountains. in the middle of a field stands a bare chested man facing the sunset. he is harris, forty ish, greying but handsome, and very fit. his hands are outstretched as if embracing an invisible entity. he seems filled with some sort of transcendental power. now, an air of fulfillment and resolve settles over him. he turns and walks away from us. camera adjusts and reveals }
<L>__{exterior unity house long shot sunset}
<A>__{once the home of victorian gentry, a few seasons of amateur repair work have not compensated for decades of neglect. but now as harris walks towards it, the fading daylight and long shadows turn it into a fantasy castle. music echoes faintly from within; it's "in a gadda da vida" by iron butterfly. if the music didn't place the era for us, the battered vw minibus parked outside the house does; it's covered with flower paintings, slogans, and the ubiquitous peace sign. as harris approaches the house, a dozen or so young people rush to greet him and embrace him. extending his arms out to enclose them all, he goes inside.}
<L>__{interior common room sunset}
<A>__{this was probably a stately parlor in its day. there is a funky assembly of odd handmade furniture. there are muslin curtains on the windows, crude paintings, and quilts covering ripped chairs and couches. despite the squalor, there is a neatness to the place. now, the camera begins to roam through the room and down the hallways lined with fading wallpaper.}

<P>__{(various)}
<D>__{ where did she go...? ... was here a moment ago... cynthia, come on, honey, we need you... cynthia, come out, come out wherever you are... the sun's going down, we're losing the moment...!}
<C>__{voices}
<D>__{hey, mellow out, we got ten minutes, i like, checked the almanac, okay...? ready or not, here we come...}
<A>__{all these comments are made in relaxed and good natured tones. finally the camera pans over to a little storage alcove beneath the servant's stairway. a hand reaches in and opens the door, and inside we see cartons, antique toys... and then cynthia, a pretty 13 year old girl who wears funky clothing and a haunted, nervous expression.}
<C>__{voices }
<D>__{...there you are, you naughty girl! you almost made us lose the sunset... come on, honey, time's wasting...}
<A>__{she shrinks back from the hands that are pulling her up and out, but they prevail, and she's up and on unsteady feet. the camera stays with her as she's led back down the hallway.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<P>__{(faintly)}
<D>__{no, please... i... i really don't want to do this... can't i just wait for you..? i i'm not sure about this }

<A>__{revealing victor, a handsome youth a few years older than cynthia.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{easy, cyn, easy. you don't want to do this, that's okay... right, harris?}
<A>__{the voices stop as everyone awaits an answer. camera pans across the common room, to the end we haven't seen yet. in the center of the room is a big cistern or font. as we watch, harris has just dunked someone in it. the person steps out, laughing, sloshing in amber liquid. standing around are other people, some already dripping wet, others awaiting their turns. some are clothed and wet, others in varying degrees of undress. it all seems slightly off, slightly eerie, despite their smiles and cheer. harris splashes himself with the amber liquid from the tub, pushes his hair back.}
<C>__{harris}
<D>__{no, victor, it's not okay. here at unity house, some things have to be done...}
<P>__{(slight smile)}
<D>__{...in unity. this is one of them.}
<A>__{he wades closer to the camera, within reach of cynthia, victor and the others. smiles again. it's the kind of a smile that inspires trust.}
<C>__{harris }
<D>__{cynthia, do you trust me?}
<A>__{she nods immediately.}
<C>__{harris }
<D>__{and have i ever lied to you?}
<A>__{she shakes her head. he gestures. the people around cynthia begin to get into the tub. some remove their clothing; others get in clothes and all. toddlers and infants are held by their parents and playfully splashed.}
<C>__{harris }
<D>__{then i say to you now... to all of you now... that this will be the ultimate joining... of man and woman... parent and child... humanity and godhead.}
<A>__{he looks at victor, who reluctantly lets cynthia's hand go, gets in. now only cynthia remains.}
<C>__{harris }
<D>__{cynthia. come. there is no shame in this. no crime. no sin. just the final break with the old world... as night falls, we start a new day... a day of unity.}
<P>__{(a command, but warm)}
<D>__{come to me... my lovechild.}
<B>__{on cynthia}
<A>__{his last words melt her remaining resistance. moving like a sleepwalker, she steps into the tub, wades forward. then she stops, looks down at the fluid lapping at her jeans... runs her hand through it. her eyes widen.}

<D>__{cynthia, come back! we can't do it without you... we must have unity, my lovechild... unity, now and through eternity... cynthia, you cannot run... you belong to us forever !}
<A>__{pause. the faint sounds of splashing and then footsteps skittering on tired wooden floors... and then unity house explodes! explosion another angle windows blow out. splintered beams propeller through the air. the vw camper on the lawn rocks with the shock wave. then a second explosion blows the victorian cupolas and widow's walk off the roof. from somewhere in the distance we}

<D>__{what have we got?}
<C>__{policeman}
<D>__{twenty four bodies, inspector. maybe more.}
<A>__{as he says this, both men watch as firefighters carry out a scorched and blackened corpse that looks like a 3,000 year old mummy. corpse closer it's set down on the ground beside other blackened bodies partially covered by tarps. as the body is set down it crunches, and a piece breaks off.}

<D>__{oh, no!}
<A>__{alan runs from the guards, shooting but missing. he runs up the hall in the opposite direction of cynthia's room. he hides in a doorway. they pass. he heads back up to cynthia's room. he grabs the cop's chair and runs into}

<D>__{but harris comes to me... he speaks to me }
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{a drug induced psychotic state is very suggestible. all we've hearing for days is "harris, harris,"... so that's what we all saw... that's what i saw when i took ralph's pill! it's all part of berrisford's plan he has this fucked up theory about how you still think you're part of the unity house, and the only way he can prove it is if you want to kill yourself!}

<A>__{click, click, click. out of bullets. the others are too busy to be noticing what he in doing. just as they pull cynthia to the edge, she looks up to see: berrisford coming to the railing, and jumping, calmly. silently.}

<C>__{wasserman}
<D>__{then it gets choice: five counts of murder in the first degree, one count of murder in the second degree. add the civil liability to all that, and you're going to have plenty of time to write that book.}
