<C>__{yori }
<D>__{this way...there's a simulation we can use...}
<A>__{and we see them race towards it. shot of them rising on an elevator platform, from above, looking down at them. a shot from the side of the sailer, rising with tron}
<B>__{and yori}
<A>__{we see that this vessel is a simulation of a futuristic spacecraft, designed for travel in the real world using solar energy, with an enormous metallic sail to catch the rays of sunlight like wind, and move with the speed of light. the sail is at the bow of the craft, and a long, slender walkway connects it with the deck area, which is made up of several connected flattened box shapes, giving it the look of a dragonfly. in this world, the sailer catches data transmission beams instead of sunlight, and is propelled along the information paths to the central processing unit.}
<C>__{tron v.o.}
<D>__{can it carry us?}
<C>__{yori v.0.}
<D>__{the design is good... we don't know why the user abandoned the project...}
<A>__{the elevator platform brings tron and yori through the center, forming part of the deck as it reaches a level position, locked into place. shot of them from the long walkway, facing the stern we see yori bending over a console of touch panels.}
<C>__{yori}
<D>__{yes...it can take us across the sea of simulation... all the way out of the game grid...to the mcp.}
