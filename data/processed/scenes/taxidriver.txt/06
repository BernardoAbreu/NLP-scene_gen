<A>__{travis' apartment. camera pans silently across interior room, indicating this is not a new scene. travis is sitting at plain table writing. he wears shirt, jeans, boots. an unfiltered cigarette rests in a bent coffee can ash tray. close up of notebook. it is a plain lined dimestore notebook and the words travis is writing with a stubby pencil are those he is saying. the columns are straight, disciplined. some of the writing is in pencil, some in ink. the handwriting is jagged. camera continues to pan, examining travis' apartment. it is unusual, to say the least: a ratty old mattress is thrown against one wall. the floor is littered with old newspapers, worn and unfolded streets maps and pornography. the pornography is of the sort that looks cheap but costs $10 a threw black and white photos of naked women tied and gagged with black leather straps and clothesline. there is no furniture other than the rickety chair and table. a beat up portable tv rests on an upright melon crate. the red silk mass in another corner looks like a vietnamese flag. indecipherable words, figures, numbers are scribbled on the plain plaster walls. ragged black wires dangle from the wall where the telephone once hung.}
