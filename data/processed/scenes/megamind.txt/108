<L>__{interior abandoned metro city library day}
<A>__{master mind reverently stares up at the painted portrait of his father.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{dad, it's me...}
<P>__{(he looks around to make sure no one can hear)}
<D>__{...bubsy. i know we haven't talked in a while, and i'm sorry. it's been a little crazy trying to live up to a legacy.}
<A>__{the painting's menacing stare seems to reach into his very soul.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{anyway...you raised me to be the worst that i could possibly be. and i've tried to live up to that as best as i could even dropping out of dentistry school like you wanted me to. but i'm about to do something now that would really piss you off. i'm going to go against everything you ever taught me. i hope...i hope that maybe you'll look down at what i'm about to do as not so much a good deed, but more like the outright defiance of a hateful and ungrateful, son. if you could do that, then maybe in your own little way you could for probably the first time find a reason to be proud of me.}
<A>__{he looks back up at the picture. is it our imagination, or does the painting's stare suddenly seem even angrier?}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{well...either way, you're probably going to see me real soon.}
<P>__{(calling over his shoulder)}
<D>__{men?}
<A>__{plato and da vinci suddenly stop what they're doing and look up at him.}
<C>__{plato and da vinci}
<D>__{yes sir?}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{stop packing. our work is not finished here.}
<C>__{plato and da vinci}
<D>__{yes sir!}
<B>__{television}
<A>__{a news report shows an aerial shot of titan setting the giant ball down in the middle of a vacant city street.}
<C>__{reporter}
<D>__{we interrupt your regular afternoon programming to show you live footage of a potential dangerous situation in downtown metro. the former hero knows as titan is placing what appears to be a giant ball...}
