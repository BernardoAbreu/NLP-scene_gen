<L>__{interior fbi office the o'ryan room evening}
<A>__{everything yet known about the murders of speck, fulcher, and starkey fills the wall space in here: we see o'ryan's map: all those yellow pins... and the one blue one, (greenville, tx.) also, that drawing: of the ghastly ziploc bags inside a steamer trunk. damn thing seems prescient now. agents mill about, awaiting a conference.}
<C>__{grieves}
<P>__{(passing by)}
<D>__{nice job, mack.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{a few other agents also pat him on the back. fran's proud of him too we can see it. in fact everyone in here seems to be giving mackelway his due. it all feels good. charlton enters.}
<C>__{charlton}
<D>__{seated please.}
<A>__{the agents find seats around the table. charlton takes his place at the head of it.}
<C>__{charlton }
<P>__{(to the assembled:)}
<D>__{okay. we've got a serial killer of serial killers.}
<A>__{fran scribbles something on a piece of paper: "what a genius!" slides it over. mackelway conceals the note, as:}
<C>__{charlton }
<P>__{(still grand standing)}
<D>__{he's a transient with a history of mental illness. he also happens to think he's a former agent of this bureau. and he is pursuing something that he calls "suspect zero." anybody got anything intelligent to say?}
<A>__{nobody's volunteering. there's just silence.}
<C>__{charlton }
<P>__{(familiar refrain)}
<D>__{that's what i thought...}
