<L>__{interior birkheim's office 1996 day}
<A>__{birkheim pores over spreadsheets, taking notes and comparing numbers. close ups on headings like "interest earned" and "deposit" indicate he's looking for something he continues to make notes, growing ever more suspicious until something catches his eye. in the margin of one of the pages is a doodling of a smiley faced penis. birkheim doesn't quite know what to make of this... but it seems to stare at him mockingly.}
