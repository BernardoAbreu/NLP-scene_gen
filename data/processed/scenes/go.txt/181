<A>__{ronna wakes up, a bit at a time, an iv dripping overhead. we hear carolers singing in the distance. her nose crinkles, her tongue finds her lips. finally a swollen eye opens, looks around. a mexican family is gathered around the other bed in the room, the father dressed as santa claus. ronna sees the iv dangling from her arm. she sits up with difficulty, a head rush. she tries to get her bearings, but genuinely doesn't know how she got here. after a beat, she rips off the tape and carefuly pulls the needle out of her arm.}
