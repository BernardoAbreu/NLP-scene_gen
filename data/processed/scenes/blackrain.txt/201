<A>__{nick's motorcycle flying over the edge of the road, and down the cliff.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{the edge of the road}
<A>__{nick, lying on his stomach at the edge of the cliff, his arm is probably broken. he tries to get up with a one arm push up. it's hopeless. his head falls into a puddle of water. the whine of an approaching motorcycle. kobo has come back for him. nick, in excruciating pain, struggles for his gun.}
<B>__{kobo}
<A>__{bearing down on nick.}
<B>__{nick}
<A>__{struggling to get his gun. finally he does. but it's caked in mud. if the barrel is stuffed it will explode. nick has to take the chance.}
<B>__{on kobo}
<A>__{closer and closer.}
<B>__{nick}
<A>__{aims as best he can and fires. the mud caked gun explodes in his hand. nick screams in agony.}
<B>__{kobo}
<A>__{pulls his bike up inches in front of nick's head. nick seems to be bleeding everywhere: his hand, his nose, his mouth, the side of his head... kobo's face and neck is caked in blood from when nick beat him. the rain pours down. he picks up the gun. points it at nick, squeezes the trigger.}
<C>__{kobo}
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{bang... bang...}
<A>__{he tosses the gun in front of nick's face.}
<C>__{kobo}
<D>__{... you're dead.}
<A>__{the sound of approaching police sirens. kobo swings the bike around, goes a hundred yards down the road, then swings back. kobo guns the engine. he gain speed... thirty, thirty five.}
<B>__{nick}
<A>__{struggles to get up. he can't.}
<B>__{kobo}
<A>__{opening the throttle.}
<B>__{nick}
<A>__{crawling a few inches, that's it.}
<B>__{kobo}
<A>__{twenty yards away.}
<B>__{nick}
<A>__{reaches into his coat and pulls ich's 18 inch shuto out. he rolls away at the last moment, slashing kobo's ankle as he races past.}
<B>__{kobo}
<A>__{screams in pain. he tries to stop too suddenly. the bike flips over. kobo flies into the air then hits the pavement on his side and rolls a few yards down the road. he stops on his back. it's lucky he's alive. the sound of fast approaching police sirens.}
<B>__{the plate}
<A>__{has fallen out of kobo's jacket. it rests in the road, halfway between the two men.}
<B>__{kobo}
<A>__{crawls toward it on his belly.}
<B>__{nick}
<A>__{mustering all his strength, struggles across the road on all fours.}
<B>__{kobo}
<A>__{crawling snake like.}
<B>__{nick}
<A>__{still moving, his arms and legs feel like lead. kobo's fingers as they reach for the plate.}
<B>__{nick}
<A>__{grabs kobo's wrist forcing him to drop the plate. nick picks up a rock. it looks as if he's going to smash kobo's head. instead, he brings it down on the plate, shattering it in a half dozen pieces. nick tosses the pieces in front of kobo's face.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{keep the change.}
<A>__{nick, exhausted, slowly falls onto his back. he looks over at kobo, their faces are inches apart. nick makes a slashing mark with his index finger above his eyebrows. the same gesture kobo made to nick through the two way mirror in new york. nick passes out. his eyes shut... the screen...}
