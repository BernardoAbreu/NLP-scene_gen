<L>__{interior helen's hallway}
<A>__{as her door is opened, by andy. ruben and m.j. enter...}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{she's in the office...}
<L>__{interior helen's office}
<A>__{the computer glow, the unfinished chess game still up, and the red headed woman's joyful face on the other. helen sits in a chair with her back to the screen, rocking back and forth, suppressing her fear by sheer will. m.j. and ruben enter with andy... they look at the face on the computer screen... (this is the only light in the room).}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{that's the face of the next one he'll kill.}
<A>__{she hasn't looked at them or the computer... she rocks...}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{how do you know that?}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(can't look at it)}
<D>__{look at the bottom of the screen. you see the icon with the arrow pointing left? click on that... twice.}
<A>__{ruben (from a misspent youth in video arcades) expertly maneuvers the mouse and clicks on the icon as instructed. now the animated collage plays backward! in tenth of a second steps we see the image of the red headed woman merge}
<B>__{backward through the distorted images and become the dead woman in the bathtub.}
<A>__{m.j. and ruben reacting, lighted by the glow from the screen.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{how did you do that?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{that computer's wired into internet.}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{he's hacked into her internet address. he's a hacker.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(rocking, rocking)}
<D>__{he can get into my computer any time he likes! this is exactly the kind of thing i didn't want to have happen.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{can you make a copy we can show on our computers?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{it's too big a file to copy to a disk.}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{you got a tape backup, yeah, here lemme copy it on tape...}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{why would he send this to helen hudson...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{it's a game they like to play. berkowitz "son of sam" hung around the crime scene, talking to the cops. this one's probably watching you , laughing at you.}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{let me get a little action started here.}
<A>__{m.j. nods to him to get along... he calls on his cellular phone while simultaneously working the computer...}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{i'm going to put a guard on your door.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{one officer already got killed trying to protect me. please, just take it all away. leave me alone.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<A>__{he won't.}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{look at this...}
