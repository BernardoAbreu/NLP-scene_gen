<D>__{oh, christ.}

<D>__{let me talk to kelly, is she }
<A>__{a deafening roar sound from just outside the trailer, followed immediately by a crashing sound. they whirl and look to the window, just in time to see the aav tumbling by, rolling on its side! there is another roar, and the baby, on the table, roars in response. outside the window, the head of a full grown tyrannosaurus rex lowers and peers inside. malcolm, sarah, and nick all freeze in absolute terror. the rex outside gurgles, making material cooing noises. the baby rex, calm for the first time, gurgles back. but across the trailer, in the opposite window, another t rex}
<B>__{head suddenly appears.}
<A>__{this one roars, deeply, a roar so low and loud it rattles anything in the trailer that isn't tied down.}

<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{what do you think they want?!}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{that's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!}

<A>__{nick, hands shaking, grabs the shoulder video camera he used earlier. he whips out the cassette that's in there, hurls it into an open duffel bag with half a dozen others, slams a fresh cassette in, and flicks the "on" switch. sarah and malcolm, meanwhile, hurry to the other end of the trailer, carrying the baby rex. outside, the two adult rexes stay with them, walking in the same direction, watching them through the window.}
