<A>__{the t bird vaults into the parking lot and slides to a smoking stop at one of the pump islands. the presidents explode out of the car in a blur. reagan bodyslams a teenager putting gas in his mustang. he flips his big pistol to lbj as the other presidents charge past him. nixon jumps behind the wheel of the mustang. lbj and jfk pile in. reagan grabs the gas nozzle out of the car. he pulls out a zippo lighter. reagan raises the gas nozzle like a gun and holds the zippo below and slightly in front of it. he flicks the flame. then pulls the trigger on the nozzle. like an impromptu flame thrower, the nozzle spews a twenty foot jet of fire which engulfs the t bird in an instant. any physical evidence in the car is rapidly incinerated. customers are running, screaming. nixon has the mustang fired up.}

<D>__{let's go! move it, ronny!}
<A>__{ronny's eyes sparkle behind his mask as he paints the scene with the jet of fire. you can see it getting good to him. in a second he's going to blow up the whole block. but he's getting his rocks off. he sets two other cars on fire.}
<B>__{a figure blurs into frame.}
<A>__{in a flying tackle, utah catapults reagan off his pins. they roll, skidding across the oily concrete. spraying wild, the fire swirls around the pump island. out of the black smoke, pappas charges like an angry bull, his snubnose held high. nixon sees him and floors it. the mustang smokes out of the gas station as pappas' shots blow out the back window. utah and reagan roll away from the blaze. johnny's pants are burning. he gets to his knees in time for reagan's kick to take him square in the solar plexus. he folds in half. drops to the cement. reagan kicks him again and takes off running. the president is burning. his suit jacket is ablaze. he shucks out of it as he runs. gasping, johnny rapidly slaps his jeans. puts himself out. he comes up running, pulling his beretta. sees the back of reagan's head disappearing into an alley behind the gas station.}
