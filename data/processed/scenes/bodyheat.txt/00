<A>__{flames in the night sky. distant sirens. pulling back, we see that the burning building is mostly hidden by dense, black shapes that define the oceanside skyline of miranda beach, florida. we're watching from across town. the sound of a bathroom shower comes to a dripping stop at about the same time we see the naked back and head of ned racine. we continue to pull back into racine's apartment night racine, dressed in undershorts, is standing on the small porch off his apartment on the upper floor of an old house. racine lights a cigarette and continues to stare off at the fire. we've passed him now, into the bedroom of the apartment, and the shape of a young woman, angela, flashes by, drying her body with a towel.}
