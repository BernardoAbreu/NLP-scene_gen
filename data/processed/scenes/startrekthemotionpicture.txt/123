<L>__{interior recreation deck}
<A>__{decker and "ilia", the rec deck unoccupied but for a pair of wary security guards at a very discreet dis tance. they are near the pictures of the five enter prises, which should be featured in this shot, as decker waves his hand about the huge room.}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{the carbon units use this area for recreation...}
<P>__{(carefully)}
<D>__{what type of recreation does the crew aboard your vessel enjoy...?}
<A>__{closer two shot (pictures o.s.) as "ilia" moves on into the room, decker follows:}
<D>__{"ilia" the words 'recreation' and 'enjoy' have no meaning to my programming.}
<A>__{decker peers at the lovely android with frustration and no little pain, for she is after all the exact replica of ilia. she pays not the slightest attention to decker's reaction, and begins walking about the rec deck taking in (and, clearly, transmitting all images to v'ger) the sights. they are near a game area (elec tronic games), and now decker points to one game, switches it on presses button to activate its lights and sounds. "ilia" watches interestedly as decker operates the game.}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{ilia 'enjoyed' this game... she nearly always won }
<A>__{and he demonstrates again, as "ilia" steps to the device, deftly hits some buttons and for just an instant she turns to decker with a momentary glimmer of recognition.}
