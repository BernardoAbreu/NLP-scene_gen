<A>__{the german agent has stopped firing in order to drive. he floors it, aiming for a street at the corner of the square. indy uses the lull to take careful aim at the german agent's profile and fire off three careful shots. the german agent is hit, blasted dead against the steering wheel. the speeding truck swerves, hits a wall, rolls over and explodes in an enormous, multi leveled eruption as its contents ignite. several surrounding buildings are leveled. indy, blown back across the square, looks on, astounded and horror stricken.}
