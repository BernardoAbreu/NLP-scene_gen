<A>__{as agent denham steps into frame, another fed, agent hughes, beside him, both g man stoic in impenetrably dark glasses }
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{patrick? hey! c'mon aboard!}
<A>__{they look up. on the yacht naomi, jordan stands waving, drinking wine with two blue chip hookers in bikinis.}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{plank's right down there.}
<A>__{denham shares a look with his cohort: it's almost a joke, this display of wealth before a federal agent. moments later, they step aboard.}
<C>__{agent denham}
<D>__{mr. belfort, i'm agent denham. this is agent hughes.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{heya! this is nicole and, um...heidi. girls, patrick and...?}
<C>__{agent denham}
<D>__{agents denham and hughes. your message said you wanted to speak privately.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{it did. i do.}
<P>__{(off denham's stare)}
<D>__{oh, they're just friends.}
<P>__{(to the girls)}
<D>__{give us a minute, okay?}
<A>__{the hookers head below deck. jordan shoots denham a wink check out that ass!}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{can i get a glass? got wine open or any kinda booze. shrimp and lobster're over there if you're hungry.}
<C>__{agent denham}
<D>__{bureau forbids us from drinking at sea.}
<A>__{jordan surprised: the guy has a sense of humor.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{i have something for you, i just gotta find it. have a seat, will ya? ever been on one of these before?}
<A>__{as jordan rifles through some papers, denham's eyes scan the deck, casually cataloguing everything.}
<C>__{agent denham}
<D>__{a boat? learned to sail when i was six.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{i mean, one like this. just had her extended to put a chopper on the back.}
<A>__{jordan points out the bell jet helicopter.}
<C>__{agent denham}
<D>__{never been on a boat with a second mode of transportation on top of it.}
<A>__{jordan finds the file he's been looking for, offers it.}
<C>__{agent denham }
<P>__{(before he'll accept)}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{names and addresses of every guest at my wedding. friends, clients. i even threw in the seating chart. heard that's why you wanted the video, figured this'd expedite whatever it is you're doing.}
<P>__{(denham looks: it's}
<D>__{indeed a guest list}
<P>__{from the wedding)}
<D>__{i wanted to show you i've got nothing to hide. i know you're investigating stratton but for the life of me i can't figure out why. sure, my company is unorthodox; what brokerage isn't? maybe we're a little louder than most but we don't do anything illegal. talk to the sec, they'll tell you, they checked us out up and down.}
<C>__{agent denham}
<D>__{the sec's actually a civil regulatory agency. we pursue criminal activity.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{that's what i'm saying. you guys take on real crime. which is why i'm so curious: what do you think we did?}
<A>__{the reason jordan asked him here, denham realizes.}
<C>__{agent denham}
<D>__{i can't discuss ongoing investigations.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{i understand.}
<C>__{agent denham}
<D>__{though, to be frank, this case kinda got dumped on my desk. some higher up felt your shop needed looking into after all that press, fell on me to do the looking.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{you know who you should be looking at? goldman, lehman brothers, merrill.}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{what those guys're up to with collateralized debt obligations? this internet stock bullshit? c'mon. if you want, i will walk you through exactly }
<C>__{agent denham}
<D>__{ that'd be great. and if there's anything you can give me just to close out your file, get it off my desk }
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{ sure, get you back to the real criminals }
<C>__{agent denham}
<D>__{ then we could both profit from this little sit down.}
<A>__{jordan sizes him up: what did denham mean by "profit"?}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{you sure you don't want anything to drink? water for your pal?}
<P>__{(denham demurs)}
<D>__{rumor is your started out in finance. even got your broker's license before you joined the bureau.}
<C>__{agent denham}
<D>__{who told you that?}
<C>__{jordan}
<P>__{(searches his memory)}
<D>__{jeez, who was it...?}
<P>__{(comes up short)}
<D>__{ever regret it? giving up the money crazed, pin striped life? ever think where you'd be if you'd stuck with it?}
<C>__{agent denham}
<D>__{when i'm riding the subway home, sweating my balls off, in a suit i've worn three days, sure.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{whattaya pull in working at the bureau, if you don't mind me asking. 50 60k a year?}
<C>__{agent denham}
<D>__{just about. we get a free handgun out of it, though, that doesn't suck.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{s'crazy, the world we live in, the jobs with real value, the ones we should appreciate firefighters, teachers, fbi agents those are the ones we pay the least.}
<C>__{agent denham}
<D>__{way of the world.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{that's one thing i like about what i do, the opportunity to make that right. take this kid we had interning last year. didn't want to be a broker, wanted to be an environmental scientist or something, he had a student loan debts up to his eyeballs. anyway, his mom gets sick, all they can afford is third rate care. some of us got together, made an investment on his behalf and boom overnight everything changes, she's seeing the best doctors in the country. sadly, didn't work out, she passed but still: having the power to do that makes all the other bullshit worth while.}
<P>__{(as denham considers that)}
<D>__{see, it's all about proper guidance, pat. knowing someone with the right relationships, who's discreet. i can change a life almost every day.}
<A>__{they measure each other.}
<C>__{agent denham}
<D>__{how much that intern make off your deal?}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{north of half a million.}
<A>__{denham summons agent hughes over. to jordan:}
<C>__{agent denham}
<D>__{can you say that again, what you told me?}
<P>__{(jordan declines with}
<D>__{a smile; to agent}
<P>__{hughes)}
<D>__{i believe mr. belfort just tried to bribe a federal officer.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{what? i was making conversation.}
<C>__{agent denham}
<D>__{sounds like that to me, jordan.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{...no, no, no...}
<C>__{agent denham}
<D>__{...sounded like that...}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{...no, to constitute a bribe, don't i have to make an explicit offer of money for services? with an exact dollar figure attached? all i said was "north" of half a million. according to the u.s. criminal code, that dog won't hunt, pat.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{heard you were a straight arrow. that you wouldn't bend the rules other agents might. he was right.}
<C>__{agent denham}
<D>__{you did a background check on me?}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{figured you were looking into me, was only fair. plus you sail on a yacht fit for a bond villain, sometimes you gotta act the part.}
<C>__{agent denham}
<D>__{this is why you invited me down to your yacht? with a couple hookers on it }
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{ those are friends }
<C>__{agent denham}
<D>__{ to get a sense of the guy who was coming after you?}
<A>__{jordan puts his hands up: "you got me."}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{thanks for coming down. now get off my boat.}
<C>__{agent denham}
<D>__{you know, most of the wall street jackasses i bust, they were born to the life.}
<C>__{agent denham }
<D>__{their father was a douchebag before them, and his father before that. but you, you got this way all on your own. good for you, jordan.}
<P>__{(as he starts to go)}
<D>__{thank you for having us. i'm absolutely certain we'll see each other again.}
<P>__{(before he does)}
<D>__{you know, this is about the nicest boat i've ever been on. just think what a hero i will be in the office when the bureau seizes it.}
<A>__{jordan watches him go, temper flaring: he can't let denham get the final word. he calls after them:}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{hey, denham! i'm gonna eat a claw of lobster now as i get my cock sucked by heidi down below. you have a super ride home on the subway thinking about that!}
<A>__{as he watches them pull away, seething }
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{he was a numbers guy, a follow the fucking money'er. he wasn't gonna come at me through my guys, looking for a weak link and a quick kill. he was gonna come at me like an accountant would, the way ness got capone, through my books. which meant? it was ass covering time.}
