<L>__{interior matt's car day}
<A>__{the car in motion, matt glances in the rearview mirror.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{how's the eye?}
<A>__{in the backseat, sid holds a package of frozen peas to his puffy blue eye.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{that was unreal. i mean, how often do old people just haul off and fucking cold cock you in the face?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{he's hit me a couple times over the years. and watch your language.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{here, let me kiss it.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{ow!}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{hey, could you two just cool it around me? you know, stop... touching each other so much?}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{whoa! maybe that's why your wife cheated on you, if you're so against touching.}
<A>__{slamming on the brakes, matt turns around, points a menacing finger. even alexandra realizes sid went too far.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you little fuck. do you get hit a lot?}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{i don't know. i've had my share.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(to alex)}
<D>__{your friend is completely retarded. you know that, right?}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{hey, my little brother's retarded. don't use that word in a derogatory fashion.}
<A>__{matt looks at him. given who sid is, there's no reason to think he wouldn't have a retarded brother.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{psych! i don't have a retarded brother!}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{you suck, sid.}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{speaking of retarded, do you ever feel bad for wishing a retarded person or an old person would just hurry up? sometimes i wait for them to cross the street, and i'm like, come on already! but then i feel bad.}
<A>__{rather than lashing out again at sid, matt turns around and lowers his head into one hand, squeezing his temples. it's all getting to be too much for him.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<P>__{(noticing his anguish)}
<D>__{dad?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{don't forget i know where he lives.}
<A>__{matt thinks a moment, then }
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{get in the front seat.}
