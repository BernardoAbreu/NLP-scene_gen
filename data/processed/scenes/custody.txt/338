<D>__{what is so important mr. stevens that you would burden this court with convening today?}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{i just needed clarification.}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{on what, mr. stevens? on what?}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{i know if i have to, i can do this alone, but do i have to do this alone? a hushed murmur rises in the audience. the judge raps his gavel on the bench.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{order in this court! a beat as things quiet down.}
<C>__{judge }
<D>__{your inquiry, mr. stevens? is it in the best interest of the children or in the best interest of you?}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{he doesn't know. he just doesn't know.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{then this court sees no reason to amend the original verdict. the order stands.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{but...}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{tell it to someone who cares, mr. stevens.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{i have. i have laid my heart out on the line time and time again, only to walk away empty handed. this love, this caring, this sharing of life, it's a sentence and my heart has been condemned. it doesn't matter who i've told, what's in my heart is never quite enough. the people i have cared for most have shunned me in life and in love. unanswered phone calls... unnoticed displays of affection... a rose that withers on the doorstep... no matter what i do, it's never enough. just once, just one fucking time, i want to be enough.}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<D>__{your only condemnation is self pity. you have people that care all around you, but you're too blind to see them. if you don't pull yourself together soon, my friend, they soon will all be gone.}
