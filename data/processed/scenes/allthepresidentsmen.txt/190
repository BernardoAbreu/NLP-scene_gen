<C>__{bernstein}

<A>__{inside. they walk across to a small terrace outside, where they sit. the terrace has a glorious view of the water and lots of girls in bathing costume, below.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{according to what we've been able to verify, you've been busy.}
<C>__{segretti}
<D>__{i've got a lot of energy.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{listen we know you're involved in this we're going to get the story, why not help?}
<C>__{segretti}
<D>__{they never told me anything except my own role i had to find out the rest in the papers.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{by "they" you mean...?}
<A>__{he waits; segretti just shakes his head.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{by "they" you mean the white house, don't you?}
<P>__{(segretti makes no reply)}
<D>__{your buddy from usc, dwight chapin he works for the white house.}
<C>__{segretti}
<D>__{i know where dwight works.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{when did he hire you?}
<A>__{segretti shakes his head, stares out at the girls.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{do you feel much about the things you did?}
<C>__{segretti}
<D>__{i didn't do anything wrong.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{tell that to muskie.}
<C>__{segretti}
<D>__{oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{during the florida primary, you wrote a letter on muskie stationery saying scoop jackson had a bastard child. you wrote another that said hubert humphrey was out with call girls.}
<C>__{segretti}
<D>__{sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe }
<P>__{(to bernstein)}
<D>__{ off the record.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{you wrote the canuck letter the one where you claimed muskie slurred the canadians.}
<C>__{segretti}
<D>__{i didn't.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{but you know who did.}
<C>__{segretti}
<D>__{when you guys print it in the paper, then i will know.}
<P>__{(closes his eyes)}
<D>__{i'm a lawyer, and i will probably go to jail, and be disbarred, and what did i do that was so awful?}
<A>__{bernstein says nothing, waits.}
<C>__{segretti}
<D>__{none of it was my idea, carl i didn't go looking for the job.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{chapin did contact you then?}
<C>__{segretti}
<D>__{sure off the record.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{on the orders of haldeman?}
<C>__{segretti}
<D>__{i don't know anything about haldeman, except, dwight's frightened of him everybody's frightened of him christ, i wish i'd never gotten messed around with this all i wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{it gets interesting if it was haldeman, because our word is that when chapin says something, he's gotten the ok from haldeman, and when haldeman says something, he's gotten the ok from the president.}
<C>__{segretti}
<D>__{can't help you.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{at usc, you had a word the this screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking.}
