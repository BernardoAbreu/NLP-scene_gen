<D>__{where? with who? everyone i know is under surveillance. i can't even be with my family at christmas anymore.}
<A>__{he gets up, pets the dog, and looks out the window at christmas angels stretched across the street, at people on the sidewalk, wondering perhaps which of them are undercover cops, at trupo's car, still parked outside.}

<D>__{why don't you just pay who you have to pay?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i do pay them, i pay them all. cops, accountants, lawyers, who don't i pay? everybody. i pay them a fortune, it doesn't matter. it doesn't satisfy them. the more you pay, the more they expect.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{you can't start with them because they can't stop. it's like dope. they always want more.}
<A>__{ana looks vulnerable. frank almost feels bad that it's his life and problems that have put them here. eventually, to try to turn it around }
