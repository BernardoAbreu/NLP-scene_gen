<L>__{interior red's kitchen night}
<A>__{red is in the middle of telling a story. arleen, billy and al sit around the table. the plates are cleared away. they are drinking beer.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{... so there i am, it's a howling snow storm, i've got 2000 live chickens that are supposed to be in denver days ago, and this cop is busting my balls because i haven't got chains...}
<A>__{arleen and the men laugh heartily.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{so what happens but this big old rooster, damn thing must've weighed ten pounds, he reaches out toward that highway patrolman...}
<A>__{al glances toward the door, stops laughing. billy and arleen follow his gaze, go silent.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{... just reaches out with his beak, see, and...}
<A>__{red notices his audience is no longer paying attention. he turns in his chair, sees reverse angle jeff standing in the doorway. aiming the pistol. his clothes caked with blood and dirt. he sways slightly. nobody else moves.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{give me the key.}
<C>__{red}
<P>__{(placating)}
<D>__{now hold on, mister. i don't know who you are or what you want }
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{give me the fucking key!}
<A>__{there is silence.}
<C>__{red}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{mister }
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{don't mister me, you sonofabitch! my wife is locked in a hole in your fucking barn! you don't give me the key, i will blow your fucking head off!}
<A>__{arleen glances at red, frightened.}
<C>__{arleen}
<P>__{(clueless)}
<D>__{warren? what's going on?}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{i don't know, honey. just stay calm }
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(to arleen)}
<D>__{your husband's a kidnapper and a murderer is what's going on! did you know that about him? huh?}
<P>__{(gestures)}
<D>__{ever wonder where all this stuff comes from?}
<A>__{arleen looks up at jeff, scared. she starts to open her mouth, when }
<C>__{deke }
<D>__{stick 'em up.}
<A>__{jeff turns. nine year old deke is aiming a rifle at jeff from the hallway. the rifle looks enormous in his hands. the boy's lip quivers. the room is silent. no one moves. jeff keeps the pistol aimed at red. he swallows, speaks slowly:}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{you don't want to do that, kid. just put the gun down.}
<C>__{red}
<P>__{(firm)}
<D>__{don't listen to him, deke. keep the gun on him.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{put the gun down.}
<C>__{deke}
<P>__{(voice quavering)}
<D>__{my daddy keeps his rifle loaded all the time. he showed me in case i needed to protect mommy when he's away.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i understand that, deke. i'm not gonna hurt mommy. but if you pull that trigger, there's a chance i will still kill your father.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{he's lying, deke. he can't get me. just pull the trigger.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{no, deke, don't listen to him. he's wrong.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{plug him, boy! do what i tell you!}
<A>__{deke looks at his father, fights back tears. his finger tightens on the trigger.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{that's right, boy. do it. don't worry about me.}
<A>__{deke whimpers, squeezes the trigger...}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{deke, no !}
<A>__{suddenly, billy bolts from the table. the rifle fires! the recoil knocks deke off his feet. the bullet rips into al's shoulder!}
<C>__{al}
<D>__{oww goddammit, you little shit!}
<A>__{red is out of his chair. jeff dives first and seizes the rifle. he whirls, aims the pistol at red.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{don't fucking move!}
<A>__{everyone freezes. jeff sidesteps to the window. billy is running across the yard. is he headed for the barn? jeff swears, turns back.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{deke? deke? get on your feet!}
<A>__{deke rises, tears streaming down his face.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{it's okay, kid. go over there, stand next to your mother. hurry up.}
<A>__{deke obeys. clutching his shoulder wound, al glares at the child as he passes. jeff deliberates. where the hell was billy going? he gnaws his lip, decides.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{okay... on your feet. now, everybody!}
<A>__{red, arleen and al get to their feet. deke stays at his mother's side. jeff aims the pistol at red, holds the rifle with his other hand.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{let's go. out.}
<A>__{he herds them to the door. arleen looks to red nervously.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{do like he says, arleen. he's crazy.}
