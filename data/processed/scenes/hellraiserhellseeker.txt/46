<A>__{his eyes hurting too much to watch any more, trevor turns the tv off. out of sheer instinct he suddenly turns to look out his window: the apartment across the street is lit. a strange figure is standing in the window. trevor jumps up and rushes over to his window. he looks out at that same shadowy man he saw earlier. the man's face is still obscured and is still holding something in a blanket. squinting trevor is able to make out what it is: a sleeping baby. the stranger pulls the baby's blanket over the baby's angelic face. then the light in that apartment goes out abruptly. trevor stares at the darkened window breathing heavily. is the stranger still in there, watching trevor in the dark? trevor cannot tell. a sudden knocking at the door makes him flinch. trevor goes to the door, opens it to find: tawny. only now she's dressed in a skintight black rubber dress. she smiles accentuating a fresh coat of black lipstick.}
