<A>__{julia hears him, and turns from her silent communing with the room. she crosses towards the door. too late. it opens. larry steps inside, blood pouring from his right hand, which he attempts to staunch with his left hand.}

<D>__{what have you done?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i cut myself.}
<A>__{blood has started to drip, unnoticed by either of them, onto the bare boards. heavy splashes. larry looks sick; his face clammy with sweat. she stares at him without a trace of feeling for him on her face.}
