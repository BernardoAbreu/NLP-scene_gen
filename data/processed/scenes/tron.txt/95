<A>__{through the head of the reco, we can look out at the landscape below. flynn sits stunned for a moment, then stumbles over to ram, who's going fast.}

<C>__{ram}
<D>__{come here.}
<A>__{flynn goes over to him and kneels. ram grabs his hands. suddenly ram's fading glow begins to flow through their clasped hands into flynn. horrified, flynn tries to pull away, but ram holds him fast.}
