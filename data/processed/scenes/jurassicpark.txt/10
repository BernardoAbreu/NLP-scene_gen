<A>__{small and plush. regis sits in the front, full of enthusiasm. grant and ellie sit further behind. gennaro stands in the back and smokes. celestial music fills the room. mist covers and curls on the stage floor. colored spotlights illuminate the mist in an eerie fashion. overall effect is the touristy where's ny? high gloss production. years young, with a glint in his eye and very comfortable with his own effect. he wears a white linen suit with a red rose in the breast pocket. like an elder carl sagan, he addresses the group.}

<D>__{welcome, ladies and gentlemen. welcome to an ancient and mysterious world, a world long before humankind inhabited it with all out remarkable dreams and questions. enter a world that existed one hundred million years ago. when our changing earth was the abode of magnificent creations. today, the late twentieth century has witnessed a scientific gold rush of astonishing proportions: the headlong and furious haste to un}
<A>__{ravel the mystery}
<D>__{of genetic engineering has become more than just a subject for science fiction writers.}
<A>__{on grant he whispers to ellie.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{ the furious haste to commercialize genetic engineering.}
<A>__{back on hammond he warms to his subject.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{biotechnology promises the greatest revolution in human history. it will outdistance atomic power and computers in its effects on our everyday lives. we'll see square trees for easy lumbering and white trout for super visibility to fisherman. why it will transform every aspect of human life: out medical care, our food, our health, even our very entertainment.}
<A>__{on grant confirmed in his thinking, he whispers again.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{here we go.}
<A>__{back on hammond he concludes.}
<C>__{hammond}
<A>__{nothing will ever be the same again.}
<D>__{it's literally going to change the face of our planet as we know it.}
<A>__{music soars. hammond smiles appreciatively, removes his rose. a screen descends behind him.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{... jurassic park. what we do here is made possible through the miracle of dna replication, commonly known as cloning. to explain what cloning means, i'm going to need my own clone john hammond.}
<A>__{another hammond appears, projected on the screen beside the real one.}
<D>__{2nd hammond hi, john!}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{hi, john.}
<A>__{in the audience ellie laughs aloud. grant, shaking his head, smiles. back on hammond the original speaks to the clone.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{okay john, hold out your finger. 2nd hammond why?}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{i need some of your}
<A>__{genetic material.}
<D>__{2nd hammond now just a minute here, john.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{your genetic material is the same in every cell of your body. you have a hundred billion cells. you won't miss a couple.}
<A>__{hammond holds his rose to the screen the pricks his clone's finger with a thorn.}
<D>__{2nd hammond ow!!! that hurt! hey, what's }
<A>__{the clone dissolves into a cascade of blood as we see a magnified view of the bloodstream. animation begins which illuminates the parts of the blood and its actions. hammond provides voiceover for the visuals.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{john, let's look into your blood, the river of life. there's your white cells, exquisitely evolved to clean up bodily wastes. and there's a mighty nucleus, the heart and brain of a cell. this nucleus has an amazing property. it can sp}
<A>__{lit in half and reproduce itself.}
<D>__{that's how it grows. and then those two can do it again. and again. making copy after copy of itself.}
<A>__{back to the two hammond's. joined by a third, then a fourth, and so on until the screen is crammed with hammond's, elbowing each other for room.}
<C>__{new hammond's}
<D>__{hi, i'm john hammond. hey, i'm john hammond. no, i am. i am.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{come on, that's enough of this! and i thought to reproduce myself i had to do it the old fashioned way.}
<A>__{new mist fades out this show. the lights go up. regis applauds. grant joins in the laughter with ellie and gennaro. hammond jumps down from the stage and greets gennaro and regis.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{that's all we've got so far. a lot of fun, isn't it, mr. gennaro?}
<C>__{regis}
<D>__{you bet!}
<A>__{hammond greets grant and ellie warmly. then hammond baits grant.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{it's been a long time, alan. i know the preceding was not your sort of enter tainment. popular science }
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{no, i don't mind popular science. i dislike the commercialization of science. it breeds a sloppiness, a disregard for method.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{well, i don't disregard method. but think of mutation which is nothing more than sloppy communication on the cellular level. think how triumphant mutations have been in natural selection. oh, but i know what you're saying. it's true that i have never been afraid to make money with science. i've always considered profit to be a measure of success, a barometer of public reaction.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{mr. hammond, the essential truth of a scientific law ha}
<A>__{s nothing to do with}
<D>__{public reaction. water freezes at thirty two degrees, whether you pay for it or not.}
<A>__{hammond turns to gennaro. gennaro smiles nervously at their clash.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{donald, in bringing my old friend, alan grant, you've brought an excellent critic to observe the viability of my island and out venture. i look forward to winning you over, dr. grant.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{just what is it you're trying to clone?}
