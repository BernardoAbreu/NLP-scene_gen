<C>__{satan}
<D>__{yeah, but it's a real dry cold. here it's the humidity that gets me. i guess i'm destined to live in hell... alone...}
<A>__{sadly, satan walks back down the trench into hell. but something catches his eye.}
<C>__{satan}
<D>__{hello... what's this?}
<A>__{satan bends down and picks up mr. hat. he looks at it, and then places it gently on his hand.}

<D>__{yeah, thanks for going back to hell for us. you're a real pal.}
<A>__{a bright red light flashes and satan and his minions are dragged back down into hell. kenny is taken along with them. at the same time, garrison, jimbo, mackey and all the others who died, suddenly and magically appear. they look at themselves, wondering what just happened. everyone just stands around in a daze. canadians and americans alike look at each other and wonder what to do.}

<D>__{this is all so wonderful. i just wish our little kenny could see all of this joy.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{oh he can, dude. look!}
<A>__{kyle points to the sky. everyone looks up just in time to see a brilliant shooting star across the daytime sky. we follow the shooting star and then slowly zoom in on it. as we get closer, we realize it is actually kenny, shooting towards the heavens. as triumphant music plays, kenny's little body floats up and up through the clouds. (note: this will also be done in 3 d cgi) rays of light from above bathe his body and he flies up into the warmth of the baby blueness. angels encircle him and give him a pair of wings. they smile gently. he feels calm. he feels good. amidst a group of angels, kenny flies upwards and finally... into heaven.}
