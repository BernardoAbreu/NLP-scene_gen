<L>__{exterior library park night}
<A>__{milo and lisa walk in the park outside the library, thinking it through.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{we can't just assume they're standing by to receive skywire 12 months from launch. i'd have to write in an aglet.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{a what?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{it's how on line services push logos they wanna sell you. you don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. and then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{but they'd still get the idea, right?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{you'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. maybe some audio, too. to tie it all in to gary. how long would that take you?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{it's a standard gui. once i've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{gary knows i'm close on skywire. we have to do this fast.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{before they kill somebody else, too.}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(a new wrinkle)}
<D>__{oh, man. i'd have to get into gary's house. to get the satellite positions.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{you mean break in?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{i don't know }
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{and what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? you said the place isn't finished.}
<A>__{the complications pile up. they walk. they think.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i will go look.}
<P>__{(when he looks dubious)}
<D>__{they'll just have a few more pictures of me snooping around.}
<A>__{they come to a fountain and balustrade at the edge of the park, stop walking.}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(looks at her)}
<D>__{why were you so careless?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i thought the worst they would do is fire me. who knew they took termination so literally?}
<A>__{gallows humor. what a game girl. he's nuts about her.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{why were you snooping in my office?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{oh.}
<P>__{(she gets bashful)}
<D>__{i liked you. i was checking you out.}
<A>__{he kisses her. there are no constraints now, there's no "adulterous" guilt: they kiss with a passion deferred.}
