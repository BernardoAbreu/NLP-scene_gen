<A>__{people scramble to get out of the way as debris from the falling building litters the area. the mayor is pulled inside by his security men. bursting out of the crumbling corner of the building we see the enormous leg of the reptile as it kicks debris out of its way. side angle wall street fast traveling shot several cars are squashed quickly as the enormous feet of the beast stomps through the street. cars flatten and scatter, flipping toward us, from the weight of the beast. we try to keep up with it, but it's too fast. after it passes, the mayor sticks his head out of the doorway to see the demolished street scene.}
