<A>__{closeup mr. beaumont his teeth are crooked in his mouth now as he tries to scream. no sound is coming out. water sound is loud. wider mr. beaumont water is still spraying out over the driveway and onto the car and into the yard beyond. a small boy, gregg, appears wearing only white underpants and a white t shirt. he holds a large red popsicle. gregg waddles around looking at the crazy water show. he holds his hand out to get it wet in the spray. this makes him screw up his face in a laugh. he waddles over and looks at mr. beaumont on the ground. mr. beaumont seems to be worse now, unconscious, but still gripping the hose tightly. his clothes are sopping wet.}
