<L>__{interior hallway night}
<A>__{janine walks down the hallway to her apartment, her vogue rolled up under her arm. she opens the door to her apartment it's not locked and goes in. a moment after she's gone and closed the door, two children about ten years old appear around a corner, giggling and jostling each other. they approach tudor's apartment.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{c'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. your father'll never miss it.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{i can't, dummy. he'll see that the pack's been opened. you're such a dumbhead.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{ok, then. i'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{buy 'em with what, dumbhead?}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(flipping open a milk box)}
<D>__{with some milk jugs i just happened to pick up on the way home.}
<A>__{the first box she tries is empty. she advances to the next and the next, finally finding one that has a jug in it. she takes it and advances to tudor's box, jug swinging, companion trailing after her in admiration. she stops at tudor's milk box and flicks the door open. she looks inside, just about to reach for the jug that nestles back in the shadows. ugh! what's that? the boy takes a look. inside the box a third parasite can just be seen clinging to a three quart white plastic milk jug. the jug is smeared with blood. the box's inside door is ajar. the tv set can be heard from inside the apartment.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{i dunno. guess the milk went bad.}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{it's still worth money.}
<A>__{the girl hesitates for a second. suddenly the parasite twitches around to the front of the jug. the girl, startled, slams the box door shut.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{jesus!}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{let's get outta here before somebody hears us!}
<A>__{the children run off down the hallway together. after a few seconds, the box door is nudged open again from the inside.}
