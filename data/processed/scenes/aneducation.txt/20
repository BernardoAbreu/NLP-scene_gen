<L>__{interior st john's smith square. night}
<A>__{it's a beautiful hall jenny is dazzled by the surroundings and the company. she's particularly bowled over by helen.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{look. we can leave our coats over there. i want to get rid of this.}
<A>__{she nods at the coat she's carrying. jenny looks thrilled at the prospect of spending a couple of minutes with helen. danny hands helen his coat, without saying anything. the girls walk over to another reception table a few yards away, behind which is a cloakroom. a lady is exchanging overcoats for tickets. almost involuntarily, jenny touches the sleeve of helen's velvety jacket. she stops herself. helen notices.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i'm so sorry.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{that's ok. it's nice, isn't it?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{it's beautiful. where did it come from?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{oh, south ken somewhere.}
<A>__{helen looks at jenny's outfit, her frumpy `smart' dress, apparently wanting to return the compliment.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(nodding at the dress)}
<D>__{this is...well, it's good for this sort of concert, isn't it?}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{helen is now at the front of the queue, and hands her coat over imperiously.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{we should go shopping together one day, if you want.}
<A>__{she takes a ticket from the cloakroom lady.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{that would be nice. but south ken... c'est beaucoup trop cher pour moi.}
<A>__{they stare at each other. helen is bewildered, jenny embarrassed.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{sorry?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i just said....it was too expensive for me.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{no you didn't. you said something completely different.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i just...well, i said it in french.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{in french? why?}
<A>__{jenny feels humiliated; she is yet to realise what we can see that helen is simply very dim.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{jenny looks away. helen stares at her. the performance bell rings, and they make their way back to the men. to jenny's surprise and pleasure, helen links arms with her as they walk.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{anyway. it's too expensive for me, too. we don't have to worry about that. if you want something in south ken, get david to take you shopping.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{why on earth would he want to take me shopping?}
<A>__{helen makes a knowing face.}
