<A>__{tron's disk turning sideways in its flight, edge on.}
<B>__{sark}
<A>__{with a crash and explosion of light, tron's disk cuts right through sark's disk, and on through sark's head. the disk shatters, and we see sark's surprised face, hands still in position to hold the disk... a jagged open slash right through his forehead. we can see energy pouring out of this wound like blood.}

<B>__{sark}
<A>__{his body is glowing, expanding. he starts to rise, his face looks up. close up face it is vacant, staring with white eyes. his head still has the gaping hole in the forehead. he's a zombie, the living dead. he rises.}
<B>__{long shot}
<A>__{carrier floating over the cpu, near the mcp's beam. flynn looks out, from side to side, quickly assessing the possibilities. he spots the beam.}
