<A>__{the orchestra blends into a vocal chorus of the song. (to be decided upon.) the vocal is shared by bob, betty, judy and phil, individually. toward the end of the vocal phil dances judy out to the terrace overlooking the water. this blends into their dance. the staging of the number should reunite the four principals by the end of the number. the audience applauds and they all go back to their booth. med. close shot betty and judy they are a half dozen steps ahead of the boys.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{they're both very cute, aren't they?}

<C>__{bob}
<D>__{may i enquire what you are being arrested for?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{the owner of the hotel we were at says we dropped a cigarette on his rug and burned it.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{we couldn't have dropped a cigarette because we don't smoke.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{he wants two hundred dollars, but it's just plain stealing.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{we left the money for our bill in an envelope on the bed.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{then we dropped the bags out the window and checked them at the depot.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{what are we going to do now?}
<C>__{novello}
<D>__{you have to give another show.}
