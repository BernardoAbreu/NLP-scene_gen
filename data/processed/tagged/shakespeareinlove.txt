<L>__{interior will's room. day}
<A>__{a small cramped space in the eaves of a building. a cluttered shelf containing various objects, wedged between crumpled pieces of paper. among those we have time to observe: a skull, a mug that says a present from stratford upon avon. at infrequent intervals further pieces of crumpled paper are tossed towards the shelf. the man who is throwing them, will shakespeare, is bent over a table, writing studiously with a quill. now we see what he is writing: will is practising his signature, over and over again. "will shagsbeard...w shakspur...william shasper..." each time he is dissatisfied, and each time he crumples, and tosses it away. suddenly will becomes impatient. he jumps up and goes to the loft area in the rafters, where he sleeps, and starts to pull on his boots. at this point the door opens and henslowe walks in. he is out of breath and his feet hurt.}
<C>__{henslowe}
<D>__{will! where is my play? tell me you have it nearly done! tell me you have it started.}
<P>__{(desperately)}
<D>__{you have begun?}

<C>__{henslowe}
<D>__{well, i am a dead man and buggered to boot. my theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn yards of england, while burbage and the chamberlain's men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful }

<C>__{henslowe}
<D>__{no it's comedy they want, will! comedy! like romeo and ethel?}

<C>__{henslowe}

<D>__{mr. henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds?}
<C>__{henslowe}
<P>__{(staggered)}
<D>__{fifty pounds? what for?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{burbage offers me a partnership in the chamberlain's men. for fifty pounds my hired player days are over.}

<A>__{henslowe and will are crossing a crowded marketplace where a puritan preacher, makepeace, is haranguing anyone who will listen.}
<C>__{makepeace}
<D>__{and the lord shall smite them! yea, harken to me. the theatres are handmaidens of the devil! under the name of the curtain, the players breed lewdness in your wives, rebellion in your servants, idleness in your apprentices and wickedness in your children! and the rose smells thusly rank by any name! i say a plague on both their houses!}

<C>__{henslowe}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{to my weekly confession.}
<A>__{as henslowe arrives the door closes in his face. a sign identifies the place as the premises of dr. moth, apothecary, alchemist, astrologer, seer, interpreter of dreams, and priest of psyche. henslowe looks puzzled.}

<A>__{a stuffed alligator hangs from the ceiling, pills, potions, amulets and charms, star charts and mystic paraphernalia festoon the place. testimonials and framed degrees hang on the walls. will lying on a couch, on his back. his eyes are closed dr. moth sits by the couch, listening to will and occasionally making a note on a pad he holds on his knee. what we have here is nothing less than the false dawn of analysis. the session is being timed by an hourglass.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{words, words, words...once, i had the gift...i could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires, love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstones...for sixpence a line, i could cause a riot in a nunnery...but now}
<C>__{dr. moth}
<D>__{and yet you tell me you lie with women?}

<C>__{dr. moth}
<D>__{i am here to help you. tell me in your own words.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i have lost my gift.}
<P>__{(not finding this easy)}

<C>__{dr. moth }
<D>__{how long has it been?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{a goodly length in times past, but lately}
<C>__{dr. moth}

<D>__{to the palace at whitehall.}
<L>__{interior whitehall palace. backstage. day.}
<A>__{whitehall means nothing yet. we are behind closed curtains on a stage busy with preparations for the imminent performance of two gentlemen of verona. this is not a theatre but a banqueting hall, as we will see. richard burbage is to play "proteus." a boy player will play "silvia," and last minute improvements to his makeup etc. are being applied by burbage's mistress rosaline. "launce," one of the clowns, is the famous comedian will kempe. "launce's" dog, crab is in kempe's charge and is not helping much. there is no set. a helpful placard reading verona an open place, is ready to hand. musicians can be heard tuning their instruments. from the other side of the curtain there is an expectant bubbub. kempe leads the dog into the wings and rummages in a box of proops. he finds a skull. he has one foot on the box, his elbow on his knee, he looks at the skull...in other words he reminds us of hamlet. we see this from the pov of will, who is just entering through a door backstage.}
<C>__{will}
<P>__{(approaching)}
<D>__{prithee, mr. kempe, break a leg. you too, good crab.}
<C>__{kempe}
<D>__{crab is nervous. he has never played the palace. when will you write me a tragedy, will? i could do it.}

<D>__{i am still owed money for this play, burbage.}

<A>__{but now henslowe has worked out that these actors don't belong, nor does the scene. he enters the fray, but his interest is protecting his property. big burly ralph is using a couple of unlit torches as weapons; he breaks one of them over an enemy's back and henslowe turns on ralph}
