<C>__{nicole }
<D>__{it was when sean walker got on. he was crying and didn't want to leave his mother. mason ansel was sitting beside me. i asked him to move, so i could quiet sean down. when the bus started up, a car came around the corner and almost hit sean's mother. she was okay, but it really scared sean, because he watched it out the window.}
<C>__{schwartz}
<D>__{and was this incident caused in any way by anything the driver of the bus did?}
<A>__{pause. mitchell is nervous.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{no, she hadn't even started to move the bus. it was the car's fault.}
<A>__{mitchell is relieved.}
<C>__{schwartz}
<D>__{there was nothing reckless in mrs. driscoll's behavior?}

<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{there was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods. and then dolores drove on and turned onto the marlowe road, as usual. i remember that. i'm remembering it pretty clearly.}
<C>__{schwartz}
<P>__{(eyebrows raised)}
<D>__{you are?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{mitchell}

<C>__{schwartz}
<D>__{and what was the weather like at this time?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{it was snowing.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{unless the report from the national weather bureau for the district on january 23 goes into the record, i will object to that question.}
<C>__{schwartz}
<D>__{i will offer that report. well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else you observed at that time?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{before the actual accident?}

<C>__{schwartz}
<D>__{mrs. driscoll was driving too fast? what made you think that, nicole?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{the speedometer. and it was downhill there.}
<C>__{schwartz}
<D>__{you could see the speedometer?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{yes. i looked. i remember clearly now. it seemed we were going too fast down the hill. i was scared.}
<A>__{nicole looks at mitchell, who stares back.}
<C>__{schwartz}
<D>__{how fast would you say mrs. driscoll was going? to the best of your recollection?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{seventy two miles an hour.}
<C>__{schwartz}
<D>__{seventy two miles an hour? you're sure of this?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{positive.}
<C>__{schwartz}
<D>__{you believe that the bus driven by mrs. driscoll was going at seventy two miles an hour at this time?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{i told you i was positive. the speedometer was large and easy to see from where i was.}
<B>__{angle on}

<D>__{did you say anything to mrs. driscoll?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{schwartz}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{i was scared. and there wasn't time.}
<C>__{schwartz}
<D>__{there wasn't time?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{no. because the bus went off the road. and crashed.}
<C>__{schwartz}
<D>__{you remember this?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{yes. i do now. now that i'm telling it.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<P>__{(defeated)}
<D>__{she said, 'now that i'm telling it'. note that.}
<C>__{schwartz}
<D>__{what do you remember about the accident?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{i remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything. and that's all. i guess i was unconscious after that. that's all. then i was in the hospital.}
<A>__{schwartz smiles and makes some notes in his pad. he talks to mitchell without looking up.}
<C>__{schwartz}
<D>__{do you have any questions, mr. stephens?}

<C>__{nicole}
<P>__{(voice over)}
<D>__{daddy was leaning forward in his chair, his mouth half open, as if he wanted to say something. like what, daddy? like 'what about my money?'}
<A>__{nicole and sam stare at each other.}

<D>__{i have no questions.}
<C>__{schwartz}
