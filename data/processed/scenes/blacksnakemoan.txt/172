<L>__{interior fisherville grocery afternoon}
<A>__{rae is looking at herself in the provided makeup counter mirror. she looks at the compact in her hand and decides against the purchase. she rounds the corner and stops. she sees sandy on her knees in the center of the aisle, building a display of tuna cans. rae thinks to leave, but stops. she makes a decision to talk to her. she walks up the aisle and stands above her mother.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{rae kneels down next to her. she's trying to make a connection.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{what happened to your face?}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{got in a little accident.}
<C>__{sandy}
<P>__{(not believing her)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{sandy stands and wipes her brow.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{you need money again?}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{no. that's not why...}
<P>__{(a frustrated breath)}
<D>__{why we always gotta do this? i mean, you and me been at each other as far back as i can remember. wasn't no love between us. and i'm your daughter. i'm the only family you got.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{you never needed nobody. always made that clear to me.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{yeah. i know i did. but...}
<P>__{(struggles with tears)}
<D>__{i'm tryin' to be dif'rent. i'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{i'm workin' here, rae. can you see that?}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{i just wanted some make up.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{all that shit's on aisle 5.}
<A>__{rae starts walking away. she quickly turns.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{i just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{the hell are you talkin' about?}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{now see? don't do that. i will go along with all you say about me. but that... you can't pretend no more on that. cuz i was just a kid, momma.}
<P>__{(a terrible silence)}
<D>__{i didn't know about any of that stuff he was doin' to me.}
<P>__{(tears well up)}
<D>__{and you let him do it. some big nobody in your life... and you let him do as he wanted... with the only somebody you had.}
<A>__{it is clear from sandy's reserved anguish that rae is telling the truth. sandy firmly grips her by the arm and walks her out. rae winces in pain like a toddler being led off to a car for a good whipping.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{i'm sorry... i didn't mean to shout...}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{all my life i been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. and you gonna lay the blame at my feet? well, i ain't gonna take that.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{but... momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... be eye to eye on this... you don't even got to say you're sorry... just say how you knew...}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{only thing i'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what i should'a done.}
<A>__{sandy walks back up the aisle returning to her canned tuna. and then the rage hits rae. with each breath rae grits her teeth tighter. she grabs a mop off the side aisle and turns around. sandy is pricing cans, down on her knees. she doesn't see rae coming.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{...tell me you don't know... goddamn liar!}
<A>__{rae clocks her over the head, sending sandy into the display of cans. rae hits her again with the mop. she is screaming in short anguished breaths. rae grabs everything she can and dumps them onto sandy: bags of flour, cans, entire shelves of ketchup.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{say it! just fucking say it!}
<A>__{mark comes running to the aisle followed by two other employees. stunned customers watch in amazement.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{rae! rae! what are you doin'?}
<C>__{rae}
<P>__{(hysterically screaming and thrashing the mop)}
<D>__{get off me! get off me! get... him...off!}
