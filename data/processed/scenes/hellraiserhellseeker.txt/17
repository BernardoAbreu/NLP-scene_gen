<L>__{interior break room day}
<A>__{inside the narrow room blasted in fluorescent light, trevor eyes a vending machine, examining its wares. he peruses the sundry sugary snacks, looking for just the right fix. it's so quiet in here we can almost hear his head pounding in pain. he shuts his eyes. a couple of the fluorescent bulbs over his head wink out and the rest flicker weakly. when trevor opens his eyes again he notices the room has gotten considerably darker. he looks up at the weakening lights and grunts in disgust. the light is just dim enough now so that he can't see what's in the vending machine. he goes right up to the glass and peers into the machine, using his hand as a visor. this strain on his eyes intensifies his headache. it's still pretty murky inside the glass case. trevor squints and just when he thinks he can read a wrapper on... what is it? a candy bar? a pale hand suddenly presses against the glass from inside the machine. trevor jolts backwards. the hand is gone. but in the reflection of the glass trevor notices someone has been standing behind him. he whirls around and is face to face with our worst nightmare: pinhead.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{it's too late.}
<A>__{pinhead lashes out at trevor striking his face with a clawed hand the rips his face clean off. the lights are back up as trevor slams against the machine and grabs his face. it's still there! where pinhead was standing is the woman who just slapped him.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{snap out of it!}
<A>__{she is attractive and studious. her sensible business attire can't hide a very curvaceous body. this is trevor's supervisor gwen.}
<C>__{gwen}
<D>__{jesus what the hell was that? it's like you saw a ghost or something.}
<A>__{trevor slowly peers into the vending machine. nope. nobody here but your average every day candy bars. trevor is dumbfounded.}
<C>__{gwen }
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{come on speak up, gooding, i'm trying to run a business here. i can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{sorry i just kind of... spaced for a second there.}
<C>__{gwen}
<D>__{well don't let it happen again. or i may have to spank you.}
<A>__{gwen grins sinfully at trevor and pushes his shoulders back against the vending machine. before he realizes it, she's kissing him real hard. he gently ducks out from under her, freeing himself.}
<C>__{gwen }
<D>__{get back here, junior bean counter. this is your supervisor speaking.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{please, gwen. you're you're all over me.}
<C>__{gwen}
<D>__{how do you think you got this job, cock?}
<P>__{(cozying up to him)}
<D>__{mmm. i'm still tingling all over from our little midnight swim.}
<A>__{trevor looks constipated. he has no recollection of this. gwen strokes his face.}
<C>__{gwen }
<D>__{what's wrong, trev?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{nothing, look. gwen i really like you }
<C>__{gwen}
<D>__{and it shows. least it did last night at the quarry. in a big way.}
<A>__{trevor gently pushes her off him again.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{please you're going way too fast for me here.}
<C>__{gwen}
<D>__{you're giving me a speeding ticket? mr. mario andretti himself?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{gwen, my wife's dead.}
<C>__{gwen}
<D>__{oh i see. that again. trevor? i realize it must be hard. but christ how long does it take someone to move on?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{that was cold...}
<C>__{gwen}
<D>__{no, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. that's cold.}
<A>__{this goes through trevor like a shot. eight months! here we go dolly in zoom out! in close up of trevor we...}
<B>__{flashback}
<A>__{quick flashes of kirsty's hand pounding on the windshield, the car sinking into the lake, a quick cut of a dark figure with a bright ring, and shots of two naked bodies slamming against each other in climax course through trevor's mind. finally, over the images of erotica we hear gwens voice as one of the characters.}
<C>__{gwen }
<D>__{yeah, trevor thats it. thats it.}
<A>__{and back in the real world, trevor is now locking lips with a very ready gwen. his hand is up her skirt. he stops abruptly and pulls back.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{i'm sorry gwen. i don't know what's happening to me. (zipping up) i think it's the painkillers, really.}
<A>__{gwen rolls her eyes. she re adjusts her self and now getting a little pissy. she's heard this one before.}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{they mess with my head. yesterday gets blacked out and a memory from months ago is played out in vivid technicolor. like the accident just happened you know?}
<A>__{gwen softens up. trevor is so earnest, so vulnerable.}
<C>__{gwen}
<D>__{why don't you let me take you out tonight? i promise to make it the most memorable night of your life.}
<A>__{she kisses him. he braces himself. she grabs his butt, then goes for the door.}
<C>__{gwen }
<D>__{pick you up round seven. and gooding? get some fucking work done.}
