<A>__{rufus sleeps happily on the floor. elle sits in front of paulette, nails in the soapy water.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{i feel so bad for her. i mean, she's in jail! and she's innocent. but i ' m the only one who believes her. donovan totally thinks she's guilty.}
<C>__{paulette}
<D>__{that's because men are big, fat retards who don't — oh, my god...}
<B>__{on the door}
<A>__{the ups guy stands in the doorway with a package, sun streaming in around him.}
<C>__{ups guy}
<D>__{afternoon, ladies.}
<B>__{on elle and paulette}
<C>__{paulette}
<D>__{it's him!}
<A>__{paulette smooths down her hair.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{it's who?}
<A>__{she turns to look as we go to — butt cam — close on the crisp brown shorts of a regulation ups uniform, as they stretch across the taut, muscular buttocks of ups guy, as he strides through the shop. when the butt stops moving, we widen to reveal the ups guy now standing in front of elle and paulette.}
<C>__{ups guy}
<D>__{i've got a package.}
<A>__{elle turns to paulette, eyes wide.}
<C>__{elle}
<P>__{(agreeing)}
<D>__{he's got a package.}
<A>__{paulette is frozen. blushing and nervous.}
<C>__{ups guy}
<D>__{how ya doin' today?}
<C>__{paulette}
<D>__{fine?}
<A>__{he waits for her to sign. she remains frozen. elle takes the pen and signs for her, trying to help. ups guy smiles kindly at paulette and heads out.}
<C>__{ups guy}
<D>__{take it easy.}
<A>__{paulette watches him go, hand over her heart. elle looks at her, concerned.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{so, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?}
<C>__{paulette}
<D>__{no. sometimes i say "okay" instead of "fine".}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? or perhaps a neck massage?}
<C>__{paulette}
<D>__{what's the point?}
<P>__{(matter of factly)}
<D>__{look at me.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{i am. and i'm looking at a beautiful, fabulous, sexy woman.}
<A>__{paulette snorts.}
<C>__{paulette}
<D>__{good one.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{trust'me. you've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual.}
<A>__{elle stands.}
<C>__{elle }
<D>__{i ' m going to.show you a little maneuver my mother taught me when i was in junior high. in my experience, it has a 98% success rate in getting a man's attention and when used appropriately—an 83% rate of return on a dinner invitation.}
<A>__{the hairstylists and clients listen, intrigued.}
<C>__{elle }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{it's called the "bend & snap".}
<P>__{(acting)}
<D>__{"oh, look! there's something on the floor that i need to pick up!" bend...}
<A>__{she slowly bends down, as if to pick up something, sticking out her tush, knee cocked. she slids her hand down her cocked leg until her hand touches the floor and she snaps back up, boobs a'bouncing.}
<C>__{elle }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{and snap! now you try.}
<A>__{paulette stands up repeating the maneuver.}
<C>__{paulette}
<D>__{bend...and snap!}
<A>__{it 's a spastic version of what elle just did.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{good. now this time, put a little arch in your back and maybe get your footing more solid.}
<A>__{paulette does it again. this time, getting it right.}
<C>__{elle }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{perfect!}
<A>__{a hair client walks over, head full of curlers.}
<C>__{hair client}
<D>__{like this?}
<A>__{she tries.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{she adjusts her like a yoga instructor would.}
<C>__{elle }
<D>__{but cock that knee.}
<A>__{another client calls over.}
<C>__{another client}
<D>__{am i doing it right?}
<A>__{elle walks over to her.}
<C>__{elle}
<D>__{more snap, less bend.}
<A>__{she turns to the rest of the clients.}
<C>__{elle }
<D>__{c'mon — everyone try!}
<A>__{clients hop up out of their chairs as someone reaches over and cranks the transistor radio, blaring "brick house" by the commodores. all the clients and technicians, no matter what their age, or how many foils are in there hair, are up and doing the "bend & snap", repeating the mantra as they do. elle walks around them, continuing to adjust them.}
<C>__{elle }
<D>__{now everyone together.}
<A>__{they all bend in unison — going down on "brick" —}
<C>__{everyone}
<D>__{bend —}
<A>__{and snapping back up — on "house"}
<C>__{everyone }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{and snap !}
<A>__{the frivolity continues as the roomful of ladies perfect the maneuver maurice, a male hair dresser, comes out of the back room, mixing a bowl of bleach as he walks. he stops when he spots the activity.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{oh, my god! the bend & snap!}
<P>__{(to an old lady)}
<D>__{works every time...}
