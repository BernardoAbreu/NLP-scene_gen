<L>__{interior kicking bird's lodge day}
<A>__{kicking bird's pipe is a beautiful piece of work. it's being smoked. kicking bird puffs away a few times and hands the pipe to dunbar. the lieutenant, aware that the pipe is something special, handles it with care. he looks to kicking bird for guidance as he puts his mouth to the tip. the medicine man reassures him with a wave of the hand and dunbar begins to puff. dunbar coughs lightly at the harsh tobacco but he smokes well, watching the bowl pulse with life at each puff. he stops now and lowers the pipe. he stares down. the pipe seems almost alive as it lays in his hands. dunbar hands the pipe back, and as kicking bird takes it he hears the light tinkling of bells. dunbar hears it too. as he looks toward the sound, a shadow falls across the arbor's entrance.}
<C>__{kicking bird}
<D>__{we were waiting for you.}
<A>__{stands with a fist ducks through the arbor's entrance and seats herself between dunbar and kicking bird. stands with a fist is wearing a band of bells around one ankle. she has a pair of simple but pretty moccasins on her feet. her dress is old but well cared for. animal teeth are sewn along her bodice. on her wrist is a solid brass bracelet. her hair is tied back loosely with a bret, accenting the feminine in her face. her whiteness seems to show more than ever. but it is not dominant. the sioux is dominant.}
