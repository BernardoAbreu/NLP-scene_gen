An abandoned campsite. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE. We continue to drift towards it, hearing the faint sound of seductive music and an occasional giggle. A small HOUSEBOAT floats into our foreground, its interior light flickering as TWO BODIES move around inside.}

He spins around to see the monster himself.}
<CHAR>__{JIM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Ohmygod...}
<ACTION>__{Jim springs off the bed, looking around for anything to defend himself with, grabbing the bedside lamp. He SMASHES IT OVER JASON'S HEAD which has little effect. Jim scrambles to get past him, but Jason LIFTS JIM IN THE AIR, SLAMMING HIM DOWN ON ONE OF THE SPIKED BEDPOSTS.}

<ACTION>__{ANGLE - SEAN AND RENNIE (EFX) as the sewage level begins to drop. Rennie opens her eyes, glancing straight down and seeing. RENNIE'S POINT OF VIEW (EFX) The ladder beneath them reappears...which gives way to a PAIR OF HANDS GRIPPING THE BOTTOM RUNG. The liquid drops further, unshrouding the now-dead corpse of EIGHT YEAR OLD JASON. He's a relatively normal looking boy, probably the way he looked back in 1957...right when he drowned in Crystal Lake. Jason Voorhees has finally been put to rest.}
