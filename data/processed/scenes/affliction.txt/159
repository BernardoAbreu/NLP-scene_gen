<L>__{exterior whitehouse farm day}
<A>__{wade and jill pull up the drive, past margie's car, into the barn. her trunk and two side doors are open. margie comes out back with a battered suitcase, goes to her car. she's leaving. a plastic bag of clothes sits in the trunk. wade and jill get out, approach:}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{going somewhere, margie?}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{i'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. for the rummage sale. and some things for the cleaners. and the laundromat.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{don't lie to me. you're leaving me, i can see that.}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{don't be silly. hi, jill.}
<A>__{jill, suitcase in hand, looking pathetic, tries to smile. a sadness passes over wade's face.}
<C>__{wade}
<P>__{(hurt)}
<D>__{marg.}
<A>__{margie, watching him, quivers, starts to cry. she drops her suitcase, out of nowhere bawling like a baby. wade goes over, puts his arms around her, pats her back. his face is racked. he, too, seems about to cry if he could. in his arms margie feels trapped, overwhelmed by wade's circumstances and terrible sadness. she pushes:}

<C>__{jill}
<D>__{leave her alone! leave her alone!}
<A>__{wade moves back like a bear, covering his face and arms. jill, near hysterical, keeps after him, arms and fists flying. wade stumbles backwards into the snow. jill still swings. margie dashes to intervene as wade swings his arms wide. jill flies into marg. her nose is bleeding. wade's caught her across the mouth and nose. she takes cover behind margie, crying. margie and jill stand side by side, saying nothing. wade looks up stunned, as if hit by a rock. marg slowly backs away, her arms behind her holding jill.}
<C>__{margie}
<P>__{(to jill)}
<D>__{get in.}
<A>__{marg eases jill into the front seat, closes the door, edges around the car slamming the trunk and gets into the driver's seat. wade stands.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{i want to go home. will you take me home?}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{she closes the front door, starts the car. she backs out the drive. in her rear view mirror she sees the image of wade receding, standing frozen, staring down at the snow. pop emerges from the house, looks at his son, grinning. wade looks at his old man, that dumb devilish grin plastered on his father's face. glen whitehouse holds an empty whiskey bottle like a pistol. hunters' gunshots echo in the distance.}
