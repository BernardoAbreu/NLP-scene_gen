<A>__{gideon's bare feet are resting on reddish dry earth. gideon is sitting in his backyard under a fruit tree with a bible resting in his hands. his house is a small, neatly painted bungalow in south central los angeles. corn, tomatoes, other vegetables grow in the yard. chickens scratch around. he slowly awakens; his hands are trembling. he looks around and sees the chickens. he looks up at the sky and sighs, with some relief. sunny, gideon's grandson, five years old, has been watching him from the back window of the house. he leaves the window.}
