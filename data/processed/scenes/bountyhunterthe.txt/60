<A>__{men running around in gowns and feather boas. a completely recovered lois sits by a make up mirror, adjusting a wig. stuck to her mirror is a photo of milo and cass, arms around each other, smiling. milo gives the photo a dirty look.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{what happened to the pirate show?}
<C>__{lois}
<D>__{i got sick of it. now i'm a female impersonator.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{but...you are female.}
<C>__{lois}
<D>__{that's why i'm so good at it. help me with this.}
<A>__{she stands and wiggles into an evening gown. milo struggles with the zipper.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{where is she, lois? i need to talk to her.}
<C>__{lois}
<D>__{oh, milo, where did it all go wrong? do you have any idea what it means to waste a woman's child bearing years? it's criminal. every month her eggs are jumping out of her ovaries like sailors abandoning a sinking ship. i mean, i know you were mad about that article...}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{i wasn't mad about that article. in fact: what article?}
<C>__{lois}
<D>__{listen to me, milo: cassidy may be a strong independent woman on the outside, but on the inside she's just a girl who wants to be protected and loved by her man. what happened between the two of you devastated her.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{devastated her right to the top.}
<C>__{lois}
<P>__{(beaming)}
<D>__{she has done well, hasn't she?}
<C>__{lois }
<D>__{i must admit, it makes me proud to think that my little girl, whose only friend growing up was an imaginary orphan with a tin leg named leslie, now gets invited to tour the white house...}
<A>__{milo's jaw hits the floor.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{she got to tour the white house?}
<A>__{now he really wants to take cass to jail.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{tell me where she is, lois.}
<C>__{lois}
<D>__{oh, who knows. she was running around like a chicken with its head cut off, said she was on the biggest story of her career. said she was going somewhere to think.}
<A>__{milo thinks this over, then a grin breaks out on his face.}
