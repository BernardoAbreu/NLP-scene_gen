<A>__{flensing day in the clear light of a new day, ladders have been tipped up against the creature's back. teams of men swarm over the crusted flesh, slicing off long strips for piecemeal burial. below, yoked oxen drag the heavy carrion away on sledges. in the background other workmen dump the remains into an open pit.}

<A>__{with the crack of a whip and the clatter of hooves, the royal coach pulls up to the shore of the lake. a door creaks open and king casiodorus totters out. his face is puffy, his eyes are red. he slogs through the mud to the head of the dragon and commences hacking at it with a ceremonial sword. horsrik steps out of the coach and draws himself up.}

<D>__{all hail casiodorus rex dragon slayer!}
<A>__{the workers pause long enough to listen to this pronouncement and cast a glance at the sorry spectacle. wordlessly they resume their labors.}

<D>__{hail and praise be!}
