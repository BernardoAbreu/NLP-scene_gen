<B>__{four pictish savages}
<A>__{covered with fearsome war paint and armed with dual hand axes, the rotting heads of their enemies are slung at their waist. the boys spit out the rocks in their mouths and yell. they turn and run in the opposite direction. only conan doesn't move, even as another boy pulls at him.}
<C>__{cimmerian boy}
<D>__{conan! run!}
<A>__{but conan simply pulls the axe from his large boy's skull. he turns to face the picts, his eyes burning. the picts laugh and charge conan.}
