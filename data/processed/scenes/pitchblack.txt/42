<A>__{start on the cutting torch, abandoned in wreckage. staring at it is... riddick. with his hands cuffed behind him and around a bulkhead, he can't get near it. or can he? near the ceiling, the bulkhead is fractured a slim spot where maybe chains could pass through. riddick stands. with a gruesome popping, he dislocates both shoulders...carries his arms overhead...passes the chains through the broken spot...and brings his arms down in front of him. a body flex pops his shoulders back into jointerior free, he reaches for the cutting torch.}
