<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{mario}
<D>__{what were you thinking, man?}
<A>__{tj doesn't respond, he backs away. mario watches him walk away, still disbelieving. he turns back to ricky and gives him the all clear to start her up again. tj walks to the entrance gate while behind him his mom's car is hoisted high in the air. tj stops at a dirty vending machine by the gate. he pulls coins from his pocket and slots them in. it spits out a chocolate bar. moments later tj stands with his half eaten chocolate bar while watching his mom's car get fed into a giant crushing machine and compacted into scrap. tears well in his eyes. he feels helpless.}
