<A>__{there is no answer from scott. the water runs out of his mouth.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{...scott.}
<A>__{scott is dead. linda's laughter is heard again. ashly walks to the window and pulls back the curtain. there is nothing there. he turns and she is there! with the sumarian dagger, linda rips into ashly's shirt, cutting his arm. he screams and watches in horror as she runs her tongue over the dagger, licking the blood from it. she turns her attention toward ashly again but he grabs her and they struggle. linda backs ashly up against scott, knocking his body to the floor. cheryl's gnarled arm reaches up through the broken floor boards and grabs at ashly's foot. he manages to turn linda's arm so the knife is behind her back. forcefully, ashly pushes her over the body of scott and she falls back ward upon the dagger, impaling herself upon it. the blade tears into her back and rips through her stomach. lightning flashes, thunder roars, and linda screams in a deep growl once, then all is quiet. ashly drags linda's corpse past the crumpled body of scott, past cheryl, who watches all of this from below, through the back door and out to the work shed.}
