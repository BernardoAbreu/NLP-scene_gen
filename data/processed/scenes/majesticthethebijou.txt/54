<L>__{interior auditorium day}
<A>__{the ocean of two hundred or so seats on the main floor seem to be, for the most part, intact although the occasional row seems to have loosed itself from its moorings and heaved itself up against the row behind or in front.}
<B>__{the screen}
<A>__{is really not much more than a tatty bit of yellowing muslin, framed by ragged red velveteen drapery. in the tiny orchestra pit, as we will see later, is an old upright piano. luke walks a few steps down the aisle. he picks a seat on the aisle near the middle of the theater and sits. as he does, a cat, an orange tabby, leaps out from under another seat, jets past luke and disappears down the aisle and backstage. harry comes over and sits behind him.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(turning to harry)}
<D>__{exactly how long has the bijou been closed?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then lily that's your mother she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty eight.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(deep breath)}
<D>__{well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, i guess. some of 'em moved away los angeles, sacramento, san francisco. wasn't much to keep 'em here, i expect. and now with this "television" thing people just aren't going out as much as they used to.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{didn't you have any help?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{oh, i had irene and old tim but they really couldn't help much. broke their hearts when we closed up. broke mine, too.}
<P>__{(brightening)}
<D>__{but now that you're back, well, things will be different around here, that's for sure.}
<P>__{(rises, grabs luke's arm)}
<D>__{c'mon, i will show you where we live.}
