<L>__{exterior woods night}
<A>__{a single flashlight beam cuts through the darkness of the dense woods. bill stumbles behind baby, she is clearly in her element.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{how much further?}
<C>__{baby}
<D>__{almost there... are you in a hurry or something?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{well, yeah, kind of.}
<L>__{interior car night}
<A>__{jerry is stretched out across the front seat, reading a book on freak shows. denise and mary sit in the back, curled up under layers of blankets and clothes.}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{fuck, it's freezing.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{hey, listen to this... i think this is related to our dr. satan.}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{oh, yeah.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{yeah, in this book there's a chapter called self made freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. it mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm less wonder.}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{it says, "records show that ellie thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the willows state mental facility."}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{so.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(scanning the book)}
<D>__{blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as ellie bogdan, the arm less wonder. says she, "criss crossed the united states constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{these dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved dr. satan working at the looney bin. i will bet he amputated her arms.}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{so what?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{i don't know, i just thought it was interesting.}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{you know what jerry, who really cares at this point?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{i don't...}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{...i just thought it was weird.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(bursting in)}
<D>__{god damn it, i must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{that stupid hillbilly slut.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you didn't see the look she threw me. she's up to something.}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{yeah, jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{when?}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{when you were outside with bill.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{she said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that.}
<C>__{denise}
<D>__{yeah, she said we looked queer.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{aw, get over it, she's just some dopey redneck, she ain't smart enough to be up to nothing... i mean anything... chicks.}
