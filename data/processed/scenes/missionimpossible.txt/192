<A>__{suddenly it's bright, broad daylight, so bright it hurts our eyes. kittridge and barnes step off a military helicopter, blinking at the sunlight and hurry down the steps. two agents immediately flank kittridge at the bottom and fall into step alongside, ready to brief him. one of them holds out a small package with "for job" written on it. kittridge looks at him. he rips it open. a note inside simply says: tgv. london terminus noon. kittridge looks at his watch. it's ten to twelve. as he reads the note, something else falls out of the envelope and clunks to the ground. he bends over, picks it up, and looks at it. cradled in his hand, we can't see what it is. but to him, it's very interesting. he steps up his pace, headed for the car.}
