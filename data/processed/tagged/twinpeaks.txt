<D>__{lil was wearing a sour face.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{desmond}

<C>__{desmond}

<D>__{so the sheriff had got an uncle who's committed a serious crime.}
<A>__{on lil's red wig}
<C>__{desmond}
<D>__{right, which is probably why lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. let me ask you something, stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{the dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. i noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. it wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.}
<C>__{desmond}

<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{a blue rose.}

<P>__{(still smiling)}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{desmond walks towards the door that obviously must go to sheriff cable's office. cliff blocks his way with his arm across the doorway, daring him to do something. while they stare eye to eye, desmond's hand goes up slowly towards cliff's face in a slow mesmerizing way. cliff tries to knock chet's hand away. chet counters by grabbing cliff's nose and pinches a nerve to its side injecting cliff with a great amount of pain.}
<C>__{cliff }
<D>__{aaahhhhhhhh...}
<A>__{desmond spins the deputy 180 degrees placing himself on the inside of the office and then still pressing the nerve guides cliff down into a chair. while the deputy's eyes tear copiously desmond turns to the secretary.}

<C>__{cable}
<D>__{well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. i don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. in fact, when the state boys called me about a "j. edgar" coming up i think i said, "so what?"}
<C>__{desmond}
<D>__{your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the federal government.}
<C>__{cable}
<D>__{you're lucky i am not wasting you.}
<C>__{desmond}
<D>__{well, little fella, let me put it this way. the operative word here would be "federal". with or without the semantics of all this, i am now ordering you to release all pertinent information concerning teresa banks, both while living and deceased.}
