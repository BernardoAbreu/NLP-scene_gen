<A>__{taping is underway. larry king sits at his desk opposite edgar vance (40s), a smooth talking pundit with a magnetic demeanor and movie star good looks. chief martin vreede (50s, square jawed), joins via remote feed.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{dr. vance you're a psychiatrist and a biochemist, isn't that right?}
<C>__{vance}
<D>__{yes. i've long believed that in order to achieve true health, we have to reconcile the body and the mind. of course that also requires letting go of a lot of our old notions and superstitions, which is what my work is all about.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{let's talk about that. how do you account for the fascination with things that go bump in the night? movies, books, videogames seems like we can't get enough of our boogeymen?}
<A>__{vance leans forward, skillfully playing to the cameras.}
<C>__{vance}
<D>__{monsters provide a means for us to transfer our more primal and darker urges into something external. in the case of vampires, you're dealing with taboo issues like predatory rage and sexual sadism. these are scary subjects for people to own up to.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{so we pass the buck to someone else?}
<C>__{vance}
<D>__{exactly. historically, people suffering from medical conditions have always been our psychological scapegoats. in the middle ages schizophrenia was often attributed to demonic possession.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{and vampires?}
<C>__{vance}
<D>__{well, there's a hereditary blood disease known as porphyria that has symptoms remarkably similar to the classic vampiric traits. people suffering from this disease are anemic, they become sensitive to sunlight, they can't tolerate garlic }
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{which is too bad, since my doctor tells me that's good for the heart.}
<P>__{(turning to chief vreede)}
<D>__{chief vreede? what's your take on all the recent rumors we've been hearing about vampires?}
<C>__{vreede}
<D>__{the only vampires i'm worried about are the ones passing the bar exam.}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{seriously, if vampires existed, don't you think we'd be on to them by now? the truth is, our streets have never been safer. homicides, assaults violent crime is down across the board. if people want to be concerned, they should focus on criminals like blade.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{now who's this? tell me about him.}
<C>__{vreede}
<D>__{he's a sociopath we've been pursuing.}
<C>__{vance}
<D>__{blade is a very disturbed individual. even the name he's chosen for himself is troubling. according to witnesses, he operates under the belief that a vast conspiracy of vampires live amongst us. you have to look at the psychiatric underpinnings here. what does a person like blade really want? odds are, he's really trying to work out some kind of inner trauma. he thinks he's slaying monsters, but he's really trying to murder aspects of himself.}
