<L>__{interior site day}
<A>__{fergus, fitting a new window into the finished wall. on the pitch we see the cricketers, distorted through the moving glass of the window. across the pitch dil walks, with a lunch basket in her hand, dressed in a very short skirt with high heels. as she approaches the site a chorus of whistles breaks out. fergus, hearing the whistling, stares out. he sees dil moving toward the site. he drops the window and the glass shatters. as the whistles continue, we see dil in the site's lift, which rises up. we see deveroux and franknum climbing up a ladder toward fergus .}
<C>__{deveroux}
<D>__{how much did that frame cost, mr. franknum?}
<C>__{franknum}
<D>__{two hundred quid, mr. deveroux.}
<C>__{deveroux}
<D>__{your pat just cost me two hundred quid.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{deveroux}
<D>__{sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, mr. franknum?}
<C>__{franknum}
<D>__{not in my experience.}
<C>__{deveroux}
<D>__{off his wages.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{do you mean that?}
<C>__{deveroux}
<D>__{he wants to know do i mean that.}
<C>__{franknum}
<D>__{i'm sure you do, mr. deveroux.}
<C>__{deveroux}
<D>__{bloody right i do...}
<A>__{through this conversation fergus can hear the chorus of wolf whistles increasing. he looks out the gap where the window should be and sees dil in the lift. the laborers whistle at her, looking up her skirt, etc. she passes by a gap in the wall and blows a kiss at him.}
<C>__{deveroux}
<D>__{is that his tart? does pat have a tart?}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{she's not a tart.}
<C>__{deveroux}
<D>__{no, of course not, she's a lady.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{she's not that either.}
<A>__{fergus walks out of the room. fergus walks round the scaffolding. dil sees him and waves, sits on some bricks and opens the hamper.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{darling }
<A>__{she is acting bright and businesslike, like any wife. she is wearing dark glasses to cover the bruise on her face. she pecks him on the cheek.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{never let the sun go down on an argument, jody used to say.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{what you doing here?}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{got your note. so let's kiss and make up, hon.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{don't call me that.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{sorry, darling.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{give it over, dil }
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{apologies, my sweet.}
<A>__{fergus smiles in spite of himself.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{that's more like it, dear. have a cuppa.}
<A>__{she takes out a thermos and pours him some tea.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{you're something else, dil, you know that?}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{never said a truer word.}
<A>__{she hands him a neatly cut sandwich.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{see, i was always best looking after someone. must be something in the genes.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{must be.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{and the fact that you didn't know is basically the fault of yours truly. and even when you were throwing up, i could tell you cared.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{you could?}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{do you care, jimmy?}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{sure i do.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{you mean that?}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{yeah. i care, dil.}
<A>__{she lowers her head.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{you crying, dil?}
<A>__{he removes her glasses and looks at her moist eyes.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{i'm tired and emotional.}
<A>__{then he hears a voice behind him.}
<C>__{deveroux}
<D>__{do it on your own time, paddy.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{deveroux}
<D>__{whatever it is she does for you.}
<A>__{fergus looks from dil to deveroux.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{if i was her i'd consider that an insult.}
<C>__{deveroux}
<D>__{consider it how you like. just get that bloody tart out of here.}
<A>__{fergus stands up suddenly. he speaks quietly.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{did you ever pick your teeth up with broken fingers?}
<A>__{deveroux stares, suddenly chilled.}
<C>__{deveroux}
<D>__{what's that supposed to mean?}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{it's a simple question.}
<A>__{deveroux says nothing. fergus looks down to dil.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{come on, dear.}
<A>__{he holds out his arm. dil gathers up her things and takes it. her face is wreathed in a smile.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{he didn't answer, honey }
<A>__{fergus walks her down the scaffolding ramp.}
<C>__{franknum}
<D>__{sorry about that, mr. deveroux.}
<A>__{dil and fergus descend from the site in the lift.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{my, oh my, jimmy, how gallant.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{shut up.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{made me feel all funny inside.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{i said stop it.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{ask me to meet you again, jimmy.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{you think that's wise?}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{nothing's wise.}
<A>__{the lift stops with a thud.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{i didn't mean to hit you.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{i know that.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{kind of liked you as a girl.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{that's a start.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{so i'm sorry.}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{make it up to me, then.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{ask to meet me again.}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{will you meet me again?}
<C>__{dil}
<D>__{when?}
<C>__{fergus}
<D>__{whenever. tonight.}
<A>__{she leans forward and kisses him. fergus hears a wail of catcalls behind him. he watches dil go as the lift takes him back up to the site.}
