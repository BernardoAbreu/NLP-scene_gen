<L>__{interior jimmy's house jimmy's bedroom day}
<A>__{the tv is off. all we see is judy's back. she hasn't once turned around to face the camera during any of the clips. she sits still. she trembles but doesn't turn around. she collects herself but still doesn't turn around. jimmy holds the camera steady. still she doesn't turn around. she fidgets in her seat but still doesn't turn around. she now sits still on the edge of the bed like she is in a trance, but still doesn't turn around to face the camera. no movement. no movement. no movement. she begins to breath heavily. then no movement. she leans her head down towards the floor. then no movement. still no movement or any reaction for that matter. it's like she is in a trance and can't wake up. jimmy (o.c.) continues to roll without budging. still no movement. it looks like she's about to turn around. she moves her head in the direction of the camera, then assumes her original position facing the tv. then... no movement. still no movement. then judy collapses onto the bed. jimmy, still rolling, gets off the bed and begins filming her as she lies on the floor crying hysterically. judy cries and cries and cries and cries. she then lets out a cry from the depths of her soul. the cry is long, hard, and loud. jimmy gets up, then stands above her with the camera. she rolls over on her back and is now facing directly into the camera. she tries to collect herself.}
