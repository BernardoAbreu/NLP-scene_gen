<D>__{you are only the second human i have ever met, face to face. you must have so many questions for me.}
<C>__{nero }
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{i only have one for you. i need the subspace frequencies of starfleet's border detection grids. specifically those surrounding earth.}

<D>__{christopher.}
<P>__{(beat; hardcore)}
<D>__{answer my question.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{no. you answer for the genocide you just committed on a peaceful planet }
<C>__{nero}
<D>__{i prevented genocide.}
<P>__{(beat, calms)}
<D>__{where i come from, christopher... this ship is just a mining vessel. i chose a life of honest labor to provide for myself... and the wife who was carrying my child.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i sit here now... knowing you as enemies. not just of today. but of tomorrow. i watched as your federation did nothing. they let us burn to death... as our planet broke in half.}
<A>__{curiosity behind pike's eyes.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{then nero, you're confused. romulus has not been destroyed. how can you blame the federation for something that hasn't happened ?}
<C>__{nero}
<D>__{it did happen. i remember it. i... felt it.}
<P>__{(then; pained)}
<D>__{when i lost her... i promised myself i would not speak another word until the day of my retribution. in twenty five years i forgot the sound of my own voice... but i didn't forget the pain. that feeling cannot be erased.}
<C>__{nero }
<P>__{(turning to anger now)}
<D>__{a feeling that every surviving vulcan now shares.}
<A>__{pike just looks at him. sees how fucking far gone he is.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{if what you say is true... you can save romulus. you have a second chance to }
<C>__{nero}
<D>__{ yes, which is a gift i won't waste on mercy.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{my purpose, christopher, is not simply to avoid the destruction of the home i love...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{... but to create a romulus which exists, free of the federation. only then will she be saved.}
<A>__{and the "she" could refer to the planet... or to nero's lost love. either way, pike knows a losing battle when he's fighting one. ever so nobly, he quietly says }
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{then we have nothing more to discuss.}
<A>__{nero reaches for something under the counter pike lies upon. retrieves a familiar glass container inside dozens of centaurian slugs, the very ones used on nero.}
<C>__{nero}
<D>__{it's not the fault of the human race that starfleet chose earth as its center. you're a more noble race than my fallen cousins. i will take no pleasure in your extinction.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{how reassuring.}
<A>__{nero opens the container, reaches for a pair of tongs}
<C>__{nero}
<D>__{the frequencies, please.}
