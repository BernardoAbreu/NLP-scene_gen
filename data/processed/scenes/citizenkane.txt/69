<A>__{it is late. the room is almost empty. nobody is at work at the desks. bernstein, fifty, is waiting anxiously with a little group of kane's hirelings, most of them in evening dress with overcoats and hats. eveybody is tense and expectant.}
<C>__{city editor}
<P>__{(turns to a young hireling; quietly)}
<D>__{what about branford leland? has he got in his copy?}

<C>__{bernstein}
<P>__{(with a smile)}
<D>__{that's right. they called us the "three musketeers."}
<A>__{somebody behind bernstein has trouble concealing his laughter. the city editor speaks quickly to cover the situation.}
<C>__{city editor}
<D>__{he's a great guy leland.}
<P>__{(another little pause)}

<P>__{(then, somberly)}
<D>__{it was leland and mr. kane, and you couldn't call it a quarrel exactly. better we should forget such things }
<P>__{(turning to city editor)}
<D>__{leland is writing it up from the dramatic angle?}
<C>__{city editor}
<D>__{yes. i thought it was a good idea. we've covered it from the news end, of course.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{and the social. how about the music notice? you got that in?}
<C>__{city editor}
<D>__{oh, yes, it's already made up. our mr. mervin wrote a small review.}

<D>__{enthusiastic?}
<C>__{city editor}

<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{naturally.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{well, well isn't that nice?}

<D>__{we've got a nice plant here.}
<A>__{everybody falls silent. there isn't anything to say.}

<C>__{city editor}
<D>__{yes mr. kane.}
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{is it good?}
<C>__{city editor}
<D>__{yes, mr. kane.}
<A>__{kane looks at him for a minute.}
<C>__{city editor}
<D>__{but there's another one still to come the dramatic notice.}
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{it isn't finished?}
<C>__{city editor}
<D>__{no, mr. kane.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{that's leland, isn't it?}

<C>__{bernstein}
<P>__{(helpless, but very concerned)}
<D>__{mr. kane }
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{that's all right, mr. bernstein.}
<A>__{kane crosses the length of the long city room to the glass door indicated before by the hireling. the city editor looks at bernstein. kane opens the door and goes into the office, closing the door behind him.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{leland and mr. kane they haven't spoke together for ten years.}
