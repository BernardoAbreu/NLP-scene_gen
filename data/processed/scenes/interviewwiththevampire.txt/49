<L>__{exterior dank new orleans back streets night}
<A>__{a rat scurried down a gutter, then another and another. louis' hand grabs the rat. we see him from behind, walking down the street, gripping one, then another.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{am i damned? am i from the devil? is my very nature that of a devil? and all the while, as these dreaded questions caused me to neglect my thirst, my thirst grew hotter, my veins were threads of pain in my flesh, my temples throbbed.}
<A>__{a smaller side street, in which every house is marked with an x. the street is crawling with rats, and louis is following them. a man passes with a lantern.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{don't go that way monsieur. it's the plague. go back the way you came.}
<A>__{louis smiles bitterly at these words, repeating them to himself.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{the way i came...}
<A>__{he walks on, following the rats.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{... and finally, when i could stand it no longer, i stood in an empty desolate street and heard the sound of a child crying.}
<A>__{a house, the door slightly open, marked with an x. the sound of a child crying inside. louis walks towards it.}
