<L>__{exterior ucla medical library day}
<A>__{smaller, but still establishment. erin's hyundai pulls into the parking lot.}
<L>__{interior ucla medical library day}
<A>__{erin is at the reference desk, eating a candy bar while she talks to the librarian. he checks something on the computer. a couple of white coated medical students pass her, double taking. they don't see many like her around here.}
<L>__{interior ucla science building, hallway day}
<A>__{a long, academic hallway lit by fluorescents. erin gets off an elevator and heads down the hall. she finds a door with a nameplate that reads "jim paulsen, epidemiology" and knocks. the door opens and dr. jim paulsen appears. he's a classic scientist: unruly hair, thick glasses. nothing like erin has ever shown up at his door. he reels at the sight of her.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{dr. paulsen?}
<C>__{paulsen}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{hi, i'm erin brockovich. i was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about i guess they call it epidemiology? and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.}
<C>__{paulsen}
<P>__{(suspicious)}
<D>__{is this a joke? did baxter put you up to this?}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{who's baxter?}
<C>__{paulsen}
<D>__{he did, didn't he? baxter!}
<A>__{baxter, another scientist, leans out of a door down the hall.}
<C>__{baxter}
<D>__{yeah?}
<A>__{baxter and erin look at each other. no recognition, of course. paulsen is immediately embarrassed.}
<C>__{paulsen}
<D>__{oh. oh.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{no one put me up to anything. i was just hoping i could ask you a couple questions.}
<C>__{paulsen}
<P>__{(mortified)}
<D>__{of course! oh, gosh, of course }
