<A>__{spector stands well out of frank's reach, staring at rachel onstage. he catches frank's attention, yelling back defiantly.}

<L>__{interior onstage night}
<A>__{rachel dances erotically with the man bumping and grinding, sinking to her knees. the crowd roars approval. frank quickly sizes up the scene. he speaks into a surv kit microphone in his sleeve. across the room we see henry listening, pushing an earpiece to his ear. henry quickly scurries to an exit. frank starts moving toward the stage. at that moment, the lucky man rachel's dancing with grabs her around the waist and spins her gleefully, like the dance partner she has been pretending to be. one of security guards rushes forward to extri cate her. the spinning man inadvertently bumps hard into the guard and the man loses his grip on rachel. she flies out of his grasp and tumbles off the front of the stage into the adoring arms of a half dozen fans. the audience goes wild. this is the kind of thing rachel was famous for when she was starting out. the scene resembles a rugby scrum... with rachel the ball. frank sees rachel being passed over the heads of fans deeper into the audience. her dress is ripped and torn apart. the silver headpiece is dislodged and disappears into the crowd.}
<B>__{close on rachel}
<A>__{fear fills her face. she's gone over the edge, literally and figuratively. she's lost control. tony and the security guards are fighting to get to her, slamming bodies out of the way. in the b.g., the video continues on its serene, uninterrupted way. frank's pov he spots a fire extinguisher in the wings.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{frank grabs it and heads to center stage. he aims the extinguisher at the crowd between rachel and the stage. the chemical foam does its job, scattering fans. frank leaps onto the floor, kicking a wild eyed young blond man in the chest as he fights his way to rachel, taking her in his arms. tony runs ahead of frank, knocks a fan off the stage and waves for frank to follow.}
