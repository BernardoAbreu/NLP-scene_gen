<A>__{winterscape: dotted with ice floes, the potomac wends through the capitol city, banks iridescent with snow, morning water calm. there's an almost hallowed beauty to it all. soon we pick out... a spot of day glo. coming out of the mouth of morning. overtaking the floes. closer on jordan o'neil. she pushes her flat water kayak downriver, paddling hard and clean, making good time. gliding through the graceful arches of the arlington bridge, she passes... cars overhead. grid locked by snow conditions. in seconds jordan paddles clear, leaving the traffic behind as she heads toward the washington monument. something burrs from a life vest pocket. she rips through velcro to free a cell phone.}
