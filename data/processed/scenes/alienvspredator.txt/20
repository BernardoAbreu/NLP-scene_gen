<L>__{exterior the pack ice perpetual twilight}
<A>__{the ship is at a standstill. the pack ice has already begun to reform, creating a solid sheet around the ship's hull. quinn and his roughnecks are hoisting the drilling platforms out of the hold and lowering them to the ice. interior piper maru hold a dozen shivering scientists are gathered around, waiting for something. sebastian and miller are part of the audience, as are thomas, rousseau and verheiden. the moon hangs low in the sky. its dull blue glow provides what little illumination there is. it's freezing cold because the doors of the hold are open.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{move these haaglunds out.}
<A>__{in the background, the haaglunds are being unloaded as quinn and the rest of his team continue to unload the rest of their equipment. lex steps forward to address the scientists.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{i told you she'd stay. it's my animal magnetism. it's irresistible.}
<A>__{thomas takes out his digital video camera and begins to record the briefing. lex speaks in a simple, low key, matter of fact tone. behind her are ice axes, tents, stoves, harnesses, ropes, thermarests, neoprene water bottles and first aid kits.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{everybody. gather round. it's my job to keep you alive on this expedition and i need your help to do that. since i don't have the time to properly train you, i'm laying down three simple rules.}
<A>__{rousseau hands out walkie talkies.}
<C>__{lex }
<D>__{one: no one goes anywhere alone. ever. two: everyone will maintain constant communication. three: unexpected things will happen. when they do no one tries to be a hero.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{for some of us it just comes naturally.}
<A>__{lex smiles. a few small laughs.}
<C>__{verheiden}
<D>__{laugh it up, beaker. you get scars like this when some "hero" on your team screws up their assignment.}
<A>__{miller looks at verheiden. no more jokes around him.}
<C>__{lex}
<P>__{(right at verheiden)}
<D>__{if one of us goes down. we're all going after them.}
<P>__{(to everyone)}
<C>__{lex }
<D>__{understood?}
<C>__{various voices}
<D>__{understood.}
<A>__{lex breaks the meeting. she walks over to rousseau who has started to clean her automatic handgun.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{seven seasons on the ice and i've never seen a gun save someone's life.}
<C>__{rousseau}
<D>__{i don't plan on using it.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{then why bring it?}
<C>__{rousseau}
<D>__{same principle as a condom. i'd rather have one and not need it, then need it and not have one. i'm adele.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{lex.}
<C>__{rousseau}
<D>__{i'm glad that you decided to stay.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{couldn't let you have all the fun.}
<A>__{it's immediately clear that they like and respect each other.}
