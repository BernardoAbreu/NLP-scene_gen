<T>__{fade in :}
<A>__{on maria (late 20s), asleep in bed. she's breathtakingly beautiful. morning light fills the room. the sound of wind, and rippling cloth. maria stirs, and opens her eyes. she stretches contentedly. then she frowns. rolls over. she's alone in the bed? no, she's not: peter (20s) sits on the edge, his back to her. two fresh, steaming mugs of coffee sit on a tray near him.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{hey. are you okay?}
<A>__{peter doesn't turn. he slowly stands and walks forward towards an open window. there's something strange about the way he moves stiffly, almost jerkily, straining his joints and muscles. maria gets out of bed, concerned.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{peter? what's the matter?}
<A>__{he pauses at the window. turns his head to look back at her. his eyes are vacant. his face is a blank. then peter slowly leans forward. and falls from the window. maria stands in shock as the sound of screeching tires from outside reaches her ears. then screams of terror from below. aghast, she finally manages to numbly walk forward, towards the window. we move past her and tilt down to reveal peter's body lies in the middle of the street. his head has burst open, his body broken and twisted. on the pavement: a line of blood appears, moving down the center of the screen. as if hitting grooves we cannot see the blood slowly forms the shape of two kanji characters. a translation appears over them: "the grudge."}
<L>__{exterior street corner day}
<A>__{a blur of movement as hundreds of people stream up from a subway tunnel. most are japanese. we're not in kansas. standing in the middle of the rush hour pedestrian traffic is karen (20s, american). she faces upstream, looking for someone. the flow threatens to carry her away in a heartbeat. she looks fragile, intimidated by the madness.}
<C>__{doug }
<D>__{karen!}
<A>__{she turns to see her boyfriend doug (20s, american) approaching. with a reassuring smile he takes her hand and together, they force their way through the throng, trying to escape the flow. they're jostled and crushed by the crowd, and doug protectively pulls karen closer.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i will never get used to this.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{maybe we should find a different train station.}
<A>__{he abruptly stops, right in the middle of traffic, still holding karen's hand. she turns, wondering what's going on. she sees the smile on his lips a moment before he sweeps karen into his arms and kisses her. as if the crowd of businessmen surging around them isn't there at all. it's tender and loving, and she responds... at first. but then she pulls away, shy.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{a public display of affection is considered rude in japan.}
<A>__{there's an opening ahead into a side street. doug and karen deftly slip out of the traffic }
<L>__{2a 2a 2b exterior tokyo street day 2b}
<A>__{ and walk hand in hand down the much quieter street, away from the crowded thoroughfare. doug smiles as they pass by two japanese high school couples, making out on the street corner. he turns to give karen a sarcastic look but she didn't notice the school kids. she's looking in the other direction, at a trickle of smoke wafting up over a nearby fence.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{doug follows as she walks toward an old temple, nestled beneath a skyscraper. a collision of the ancient and modern. the fence surrounds a graveyard adjacent to the temple.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{we walk past this temple every day, karen }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{yeah, but i've never seen this before.}
<A>__{a japanese man stands before an ornate headstone, lighting a bundle of incense and bowing before the grave.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{it's a buddhist ritual. the incense smoke carries the prayers to the spirits of his ancestors, to help them remain at peace.}
<A>__{clink. she turns as doug, grinning, lights a cigarette with his zippo, flicking it shut and pocketing it.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{it's amazing. you're like this infinite storehouse of wisdom. or trivia. i'm not sure which.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{it's not trivia. it's what they believe. and it's far better, by the way, than your little pollution ritual.}
<A>__{doug's grin softens to a smile. he doesn't respond... but the way he's looking at karen makes her curious:}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{he turns away for a moment, almost shyly, dropping his cigarette and crushing it. finally:}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{nothing. i just i like that about you. you seem to be able to remember everything that's really important.}
<A>__{she smiles. a tender moment. then... he checks his watch.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{except the time.}
<A>__{karen checks her own watch, realizing }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{oh, crap }
<A>__{she grabs his hand and starts to walk quickly.}

<D>__{c'mon, you're gonna be late.}

<A>__{an international college in tokyo. the autumn chill doesn't deter the students from enjoying the beautiful day. karen and doug, still holding hands, enter the campus.}
<L>__{2cc exterior nursing care center day 2cc}
<A>__{karen and doug approach the doors of a nursing care center. she pulls him to the side just as he's stepping under a workman's ladder by the doors.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{uh uh. seven years of bad luck.}
<P>__{(before doug can respond:)}
<D>__{and i might have a vested interest in those years.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{is that right?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{maybe.}
<A>__{doug smiles, kissing her romantically. then:}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{will i see you tonight?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i will call you when i get home.}
<A>__{with a flourish, doug swings himself back under the ladder.}

<D>__{fourteen. i hate odd numbers.}

<A>__{through the front doors, we see doug kiss karen again. they finally separate, and doug walks off. then karen walks through the doors into a bright, atrium like lobby area. she waves "hello" to the receptionist. leaning against a desk behind reception is karen's boss alex (40s, american). he's got a phone to his ear it's ringing. an answering machine picks up in japanese. alex mutters and hangs up. then he notices }
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{karen!}
<A>__{she's started up a staircase in the center of the lobby. she turns and comes back down, walking over to alex.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{are you free this afternoon?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i just came by to pick up some books i left here. i'm not scheduled to work today }
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i know. but are you free? do you have class?}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(shaking her head:)}
<D>__{just a test to study for. why?}
<A>__{alex smiles, holding out a file.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{your wish has been granted.}
<A>__{karen takes the file and opens it, looking at the first page a picture of an older woman (emma) is attached.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{it's yoko's case, but she didn't show up for work this morning, and i can't reach her at home. she must be sick, or something. and she has the damn house key.}
<A>__{studying the file, karen squints.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what's this phrase?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{"mild dementia with severe lethargy." apparently she sleeps through most of the day. her daughter in law doesn't work, so she'll probably be there.}
<A>__{karen seems unsure. it's a big step for her.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you're the one who's been bugging me about getting out there on your own. besides, it's an english only house.}
<A>__{one of alex's co workers appears in the doorway, motioning to him. alex quickly hands karen a card:}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{here's the address. use the wall chart if you need help and don't forget to bring a map.}
<A>__{karen looks at the address a string of thirty numbers and japanese characters. she glances up at the wall chart: a color coded diagram shows how the long address string is broken down into postal code, prefecture, city, ward, district, block, sub block and house number.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{don't worry karen, you're ready.}
<A>__{karen nods. but she's not quite as confident.}
<L>__{4a interior rail station day 4a}
<A>__{people rush madly around karen as she studies a large map on the wall. it's the tokyo rail system daunting, at best.}
<L>__{4b 4b 4bb interior train day 4bb}
<A>__{karen sits uncomfortably on the crowded transit car, squeezed in tightly by the people around her. the loud crying of a baby adds to her discomfort.}

<A>__{the transit car pulls to a stop and a handful of people get out. karen is one of them, shouldering her backpack.}
<L>__{5a 5a exterior shopping district day}
<A>__{karen walks down the populated sidewalk, weaving through street vendors, and passing a large grocery store. she pauses, looking at the address on her card. she approaches a woman and her daughter (6) and speaks to them in japanese. the woman nods, pointing towards a small alley. karen gives the daughter a smile; the girl hides behind her mother's leg.}
<L>__{exterior tokyo neighborhood day}
<A>__{karen exits the alley, entering a quiet, narrow street. she's still not sure if she's in the right place. but then her eyes fix on something. she begins to walk towards it, her gaze never leaving it }
<L>__{6a exterior the house day 6a}
<A>__{ it's the house. cozy and shaded, nestled into the dead end of the street. large by tokyo standards. she double checks the address and opens the gate, walking around a bicycle leaning against the wall and following the stepping stone path to the front door. she knocks. no answer. she tries again. nothing. then, an afterthought, she tries the handle. it's unlocked.}
<L>__{interior the house entrance day}
<A>__{karen pokes her head inside the genkan (entry hall).}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{hello? mrs. williams?}
<A>__{nothing. she tentatively steps inside, and the door closes behind her. it's dark and musty the blinds are drawn.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{is anyone here?}
<A>__{she turns and locks the front door.}
<L>__{8 interior the house living room day}
<A>__{karen stands in the doorway, surveying the room. the place is in a complete state of disarray. a scraping sound grabs karen's attention. her pov: at the far end of the room, a frosted glass paneled door leads to an adjacent room. a hand is visible on the other side, clawing at the glass. karen runs over and slides open the door, revealing }

<C>__{karen}
<D>__{oh my god... are you alright? }
<A>__{karen immediately kneels down next to the infirm woman, helping her sit up. emma looks dazed and disoriented. karen's eyes sweep the room. it reeks of neglect.}
<L>__{9 exterior the house porch day}
<A>__{emma sits on the back porch, staring vacantly. but her expression isn't simply blank there's an odd sadness there. karen is washing the dirty sheets in a bucket and hanging them to dry. she finishes, turning to her charge.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{okay, emma. let's try again: my name is karen. do you remember? i'm from the health center. i'm substituting for yoko, just for today.}
<A>__{emma doesn't respond and there's no indication that she remembers karen introducing herself before. kneeling in front of emma, karen notices a band aid around one of her fingers. blood has soaked through it.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{looks like you need a new band aid. how'd this happen, emma?}
<P>__{(still no reaction)}
<D>__{would you like a bath? maybe that will help you feel better.}
<A>__{emma doesn't even turn towards her.}

<C>__{karen}
<D>__{it's okay, emma.}
<A>__{she takes emma's hand and walks inside. but emma doesn't budge. her free hand tightly clutches the door frame. her eyes are wide. staring at the bathtub.}
<L>__{12 exterior the house porch day}
<A>__{karen uses a sponge to bathe emma, her robe rolled to her waist. emma stares absently at the sky.}
<L>__{interior the house living room dusk}
<A>__{with emma back in bed, karen steps out of the back room and slides the door shut. leans against it for a moment. a tough first day on the job.}
<L>__{interior the house living room dusk}
<A>__{karen has straightened up the room, and is vacuuming the floor. something under the couch catches in the vacuum intake, jamming it. she turns off the vacuum and feels underneath, pulling out a crumpled photo ripped into pieces, compressed in a ball.}
<L>__{interior the house kitchen dusk}
<A>__{karen sits at the kitchen table, flattening and taping together the pieces of the photograph. she finishes. on the photo: a grinning japanese boy holds a cute black cat. his mother and father stand beside him. they're all beaming at the camera a perfect, happy family. but there's a piece missing. the mother's face. karen walks back into the living room. she looks underneath the couch for the missing piece. can't see anything. she lays down and sticks her arm under the couch, feeling around. nothing. karen sticks her arm in deeper, to the shoulder, straining... she suddenly jerks her arm back, wincing. she has a small cut on her finger. karen looks under the couch for what cut her a small furniture nail sticks out underneath.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{nice one, karen.}
<A>__{she gets to her feet, folding up the incomplete picture and stuffing it into her pocket.}
<L>__{16 interior the house entrance dusk}
<A>__{karen steps into the foyer with the vacuum cleaner. she looks up at a railing overhead. some trash is visible sticking over the edge. karen shakes her head:}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{how did you get up there?}
<A>__{she gathers up the vacuum and heads up to the second floor hallway. there's a nearby door, closed (the front room), and an open door at the end (the rear room). as she looks for an outlet, she hears a scratching sound. karen stands there for a moment, listening. silence. then she walks towards the open door at the end of the hall.}
<L>__{interior the house rear room dusk}
<A>__{karen steps inside. moving boxes are stacked against the wall, next to a desk. it's an unfinished room. she listens. no scratching. nothing unusual here. except karen notices a lone object sitting on an otherwise empty shelf. it's a black ceramic cat. facing the wall. strange. and then karen hears the scratching sound again.}
<L>__{18 interior the house second floor hallway dusk}
<A>__{karen steps into the hallway and listens. there it is again, and this time there's no doubt the sounds are coming from the room by the stairs. karen walks to the door. she pauses, disturbed by the eerie sounds from inside. then she reaches for the doorknob. thud. thud. karen hesitates. the strange rhythmic thudding continues, coming from beyond the door.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(nervous:)}
<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{karen takes a breath. and turns the doorknob.}
<L>__{19 interior the house front room dusk}
<A>__{the sounds immediately stop as karen enters the master bedroom. it's dark, thick blinds covering the windows. a frosted window, overlooking the foyer, isn't helping much. she stands there for a moment, listening. silence. then scratch scratch. startled, she gasps and turns towards the closed closet doors. that's where the sound is coming from. and then she notices something strange about the closet door: it's been sealed shut with duct tape. the scratching quickens, as if sensing a presence nearby. and then there's a muffled meow. there's a cat in there? karen pulls off the duct tape. she reaches for the door handle, slowly sliding it open a crack and peering inside the closet seems empty, except for a large book on a shelf. karen reaches inside and picks it up. then she sees, in the darkened far corner of the closet, a small black cat. it's sitting on something, watching her. karen slides the door the rest of the way open revealing a young japanese boy (age 7) sitting in the corner, staring at karen. the cat is curled up on his lap. startled, karen drops the book and falls backwards.}

<A>__{karen is on her cell phone:}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{yes, he was shut in a closet! there was tape around the no, they're not home yet. i don't know, emma hasn't said a word to me he's still upstairs yes, i'm sure he's japanese but yes, alright, alex. just please get here as soon as you can.}
<A>__{karen hangs up, putting the phone down on the kitchen table. she leans against the counter, exasperated. then her attention turns to the book she found in the closet. karen can't resist. she opens it. the book is a large journal, filled with elegant japanese writing. karen flips through it, stopping on a photograph. a handsome young man, smiling at the camera. we recognize him. it's peter, from the opening scene.}
<L>__{interior the house entrance night}
<A>__{karen walks to the front door, reaching out to unlock it but she pauses, realizing something. she reaches into her pocket, pulling out the photo she found. it only takes a second to verify the boy in the photo is the one she found in the closet. karen lowers the photo, bewildered. then she looks up, startled by the boy. he's kneeling on the second floor landing above, watching her through the bars of the metal railing. creepy. karen takes a step forward, forcing a smile.}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{hello there. really creepy.}

<D>__{"i just wanted to make sure mom is okay. yesterday was... a bit weird, and i'm just a little worried."}

<C>__{susan }
<D>__{"listen, just give me a call when you can, okay?"}
<A>__{click. too late the caller hangs up. silence returns to the room... but not completely. karen hears the soft sound of whispering from nearby. beyond her, we see a pale face (kayako) pressed against the frosted window of the sliding door of the tatami room. the face pulls away from the glass just before karen turns towards it. but the sound of whispering continues. as she slowly walks to the door, we can make out some words:}

<A>__{no answer. she slowly walks to the bedroom and looks inside. he's not there. this seems to worsen karen's mood. karen looks down at a notepad. she's written three japanese names. the detectives in charge of the case three years ago. they all have red lines drawn through them. then we pan up to see that these are the last names on a longer list. we recognize the other names: matthew, jennifer, and emma williams; yoko and alex; nakagawa and igarashi. everyone who's been in the house. everyone who died. all the names have been crossed out except `nakagawa' and `igarashi'. karen picks up a red pen and draws a line through them. then we see one final name at the bottom: `me.' now the only one not crossed out. the only one left. karen puts down her pen. then she looks up at the wall, where's she's taped all the pictures and articles in a circle. karen realizes something. she reaches for the lamp, and turns it closer the picture in the middle of the "spider's web" is gone. the photo of the house. karen draws a breath. then, out of the corner of her eye, she sees something she hadn't noticed before a faint red flashing from a small table by the kitchen. she slowly stands. walks over to it. the flashing red light is barely visible on her face, as she looks down at her answering machine. the message light is blinking. `1 message'. she reaches out a shaky finger and presses `play'.}

<A>__{doug stands at the gate, lighting a cigarette, looking down at the police tape sealing the entrance. he pockets his zippo and ducks under the tape, walking up to the front door. doug tries the handle, and the door swings open. he stands on the porch, looking into the dark place.}

<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{as he takes a step forward his foot bumps the gas cans, still sitting by the front door. he's confused and then he gets a good idea. he tosses his cigarette outside and closes the front door.}

<A>__{doug walks to the front room door and opens it. he leans inside, trying to let his eyes adjust to the dark. then he walks down the hall to the rear room. does the same. nothing but darkness beyond. doug closes the door and turns away from it, wondering why he's here, what he's looking for. he reaches into his pocket and pulls out his cell phone. speed dials karen's number. as he raises it to his ear he doesn't notice the door to the rear room slowly swinging open behind him }
<L>__{127 exterior the house night}
<A>__{karen runs towards us, breathless, stopping as she reaches the house. looming over her. waiting. she only hesitates a moment before running inside.}
<L>__{interior the house night}
<A>__{karen enters, calling out:}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{doug! where are you???}
<A>__{a muffled sound from upstairs. a voice.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{doug???}
<A>__{karen immediately runs up the stairs to the second floor. before she reaches the top of the stairs, karen suddenly realizes: the voice she's hearing isn't doug's.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{hey, maria, it's me. yeah, i'm still at school...}
<A>__{karen slowly looks up to see peter. she recognizes him immediately. he's standing in the hallway, talking on his cell phone.}
<C>__{peter }
<D>__{...i know, i'm sorry these staff meetings always run over maybe another ten minutes or so okay, i will be home soon i love you too.}
<A>__{he hangs up. leans against the wall. looking into the front bedroom. karen gasps as she sees toshio through the open door. he's sitting on the ground, making drawings of black cats. this is his bedroom.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{guess your mom's late, huh?}
<A>__{then toshio suddenly looks up. right at karen. following toshio's gaze, peter quickly turns to face karen. but even though she's right there, he doesn't see her: she's seeing something that happened three years ago. as if sensing her presence, peter walks right to the edge of the stairs, looking down. then: a rustling sound comes from the dark hallway. peter turns towards the rear bedroom at the end of the hall.}
<L>__{129 interior the house rear bedroom night}
<A>__{peter stands in the doorway, looking into the master bedroom of toshio's parents. his attention is drawn to something near the door a desk. it's got a computer, some files. someone's personal work space. peter steps to the desk. he picks up a stack of photographs. family pictures: with father (takeo), mother (kayako), and son (toshio), holding his black cat. kayako's face has been torn out of every one. peter notices something underneath the pile of photos a familiar journal. the same one karen found in the closet. he opens it. his pov: it's a journal kayako kept. as peter flips through it, kayako's voice speaks the words... ...and even though it's mostly japanese, there's one word we recognize, that she's written repeatedly "peter". it's been written over and over, in both english and japanese, as if she couldn't get enough of seeing it. past the early pages karen saw, the writing becomes more manic, the delicate script becoming a frantic scrawl, kayako's voice becomes more desperate and pleading. taped on the final page is a photo: peter with a group of his university friends, at a party. kayako has scribbled hearts around his head, and scratched out the other faces. a bloody thumbprint distorts peter's face. it's still wet. peter slams the book shut and drops it. as he does, a photograph falls out from inside, landing right side up. the photo is of peter at a college party, talking with maria. it's clear they're having a great time with one another... ...but the photo is torn in half, splitting maria's face. and kayako is visible between them, sadly and stoically watching peter, strands of hair falling down her face. peter and karen both reach to pick up the photo at the same time and they bump shoulders. karen falls backwards, against the wall. in disbelief, peter looks around wildly. he reaches out a tentative hand, feeling around... karen moves out of the way. she can't understand how this could be happening. as peter is about to stand back up, something small flutters down from above, landing on the floor in front of him. it's kayako's face. one of the missing pieces from the torn out photographs. peter slowly looks up to see all the missing kayako faces have been pinned to the closet door. many of the pins go through her eyes. and that's when peter and karen hear the flies. buzzing anxiously. sounds like there's a lot of them. it's coming from the closet. just behind the torn out faces. karen watches, terrified, as peter reaches out a hand and slides the door open. he immediately recoils. a terrible stench inside. the buzzing of the flies is louder. coming from above. peter pulls a book of matches from his pocket. lights one. and looks up. his pov: the attic panel is slightly open. peter reaches up to open it fully and the upper half of kayako swings down. she's been wrapped in plastic sheeting, mottled splotches of blood on the inside. her neck hangs at an odd angle. peter backs away in horror }
<L>__{interior the house second floor hallway night}
<A>__{peter backs into the hallway, breathing hard. then a familiar sound reaches our ears: thud. thud. thud. it's coming from toshio's room. and it's the same rhythmic thudding we've heard coming from this room before. peter wrenches his gaze from the horrific sight and heads quickly down the hall (with karen following him):}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{toshio! we have to }
<A>__{he stops short at the door, as he sees takeo, toshio's father. eyes rolled back in his head, tongue swollen and lolling from his blue lips. he's dead he's hanging from the ceiling by black hair that seems to cover its entire surface. kayako's hair. toshio, now back to his "dead" appearance, playfully swings the body. takeo's feet thud rhythmically against the wall.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{oh my god...}
<A>__{peter doesn't stay to see any more. he runs.}
<L>__{131 interior the house entrance night}
<A>__{peter tears down the stairs and runs for the front door, passing a mirror he freezes. he saw something in the reflection as he passed. something wrong. he takes a step back and looks it's not his reflection in the mirror. it's kayako. peter stares at the image in disbelief. then he notices toshio standing next to kayako, looking up at her. as peter slowly turns to look down, a small pale hand slips into his own. peter jerks backward in shock as a series of images, the origin of "the grudge", flash by: takeo, looking down at the journal, reading his wife's words, his face contorted with rage... he turns to see kayako, home from work, standing in the doorway... kayako running down the steps, takeo chasing her, tackling her before she can reach the door... sitting on top of her, he wraps his hands around her neck... kayako seeing toshio, her son, watching through the bars of the second floor railing as... takeo snaps kayako's neck with an audible crack... kayako, not dead, but paralyzed, watching as... takeo drowns a flailing toshio in the bathroom tub... takeo tears apart toshio's cat, still alive, in the bathroom sink... kayako letting out a horrible croaking, the only sound her broken neck can emit, as takeo advances on her with a knife, his eyes filled with a manic madness... takeo in the attic, stuffing kayako and toshio, both very dead, wrapped in plastic sheeting, into a corner... kayako suddenly turning her head and grabbing takeo's arm... her lifeless eyes focusing on takeo's as she croaks... takeo's eyes go wide with fear... and toshio suddenly reaches from his plastic grave, grabbing takeo's other arm...}
<T>__{back to the present:}
<A>__{we pan from peter to the reflection in the mirror it's not the pale, frightening kayako anymore. rather: a beautiful, young kayako with eyes filled with sorrow. we pan back to see karen standing there, instead of peter. karen slumps to the ground in front of the mirror, the revelation taking everything out of her. a beat. then:}
<D>__{that came from upstairs.}
<B>__{thump.}
<A>__{karen looks up as the sound continues. we pan over towards the stairs as a dragging sound moves across the ceiling. accompanied by a strange scraping, like plastic.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{no more... please, no more...}
<A>__{she suddenly freezes, sensing something next to her. we see it now, as she turns her head, almost hidden in the darkness a pale face in the darkened hallway, staring up at the ceiling. eyes wide and rolled back, mouth yawning open in abject terror it's doug's body. he lies on his back, his top half sticking out from a niche by the stairwell. it's been right next to her all along.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{doug! no!!!}
<A>__{karen takes doug into her arms as the sounds continue above, growing closer. but it's no use he's dead. and now there's a new sound, moving down the stairs. a familiar throaty croaking sound, along with a strange skittering, like the world's biggest cockroach. karen turns to the staircase to see kayako, crawling down the stairs. still wrapped in the plastic sheeting, she moves like a wounded animal, neck hanging limply, struggling to pull herself forward her eyes locked on karen, croaking horribly karen sorrow turns to abject terror. she tries to lift doug's body and pull it to the front door. it's too heavy. and kayako is getting closer. sobbing, karen drops doug and falls back against the front door, bumping into the gas cans. the one nakagawa unscrewed tips over, spilling gasoline into the entryway. as doug's arm flops to the floor, his outstretched hand lands next to karen. she sees something clenched in his fingers his zippo lighter. realization dawns over karen as she feels the liquid spilling onto her hands. the odor is unmistakable. karen immediately reaches forward, trying to loosen doug's grip on the lighter as kayako reaches the bottom of the stairs. her broken neck makes a horrific cracking as she swivels to face karen. karen finally gets the lighter. she pushes back against the door with legs too numb to stand. her eyes drift up to see toshio, watching from the railing above, as before, his cold eyes locked on hers. karen grabs another can, and spins the lid until it pops off. she tips it onto the floor, spilling more gas. kayako doesn't seem to care. she crawls over doug's body and pulls herself through the gasoline, slowly, drawing inexorably closer karen drops the empty gas can and opens doug's lighter. she flicks it. nothing. karen tries the lighter again. and again. nothing. kayako reaches out, blood dripping from her gaping mouth the lighter catches. karen flails with her free arm and opens the front door just as kayako grabs her ankle. karen reaches outside, anchoring a hand to the door frame but she can't pull herself free, as kayako pulls herself closer, her croaking intensifying resigned, karen slowly lowers the flame to the gas can and ignites the gas! there's a sudden bright flash that overtakes the screen }

<A>__{the flashing lights of police cars wash over the formerly quiet neighborhood, illuminating karen. she's lying on a gurney, regaining consciousness. japanese emts are speaking to her as she's being loaded into the back of an ambulance. karen's pov: the blurry forms of firemen rush by in slow motion. everything is dizzy and incoherent... karen tries to sit up but a young emt lays a gentle hand on her arm, deftly sliding a needle under her skin. the sedative takes hold almost immediately. karen sinks back into the gurney, her eyes rolling back in her head. she's fading fast.}
<L>__{132b interior ambulance night 132b}
<A>__{the emts secure the gurney inside and close the doors. karen fights the drug, but its grip is inevitable: she finally gives up, sliding into a medicated sleep. we slowly move in on her face, until it fills the screen. then...}

<A>__{...the light changes. darkness becomes morning sunlight spilling across karen's face. the tranquil sound of birds chirping surrounds us. but it sounds like a distant echo. karen's eyelids flutter. she opens her eyes and sits up, now wide awake but peaceful and calm. she gently swings her legs from the gurney and walks to the window, confused by the daylight. she looks out to see }
<L>__{132d 132d exterior the house day}
<A>__{it's the most beautiful we've ever seen it. a lush springtime bloom fills the trees and bushes around the place. voices off screen (japanese) are audible, getting closer on karen, as she is surprised to see... kayako. beautiful and meek. she's smiling, walking hand in hand with takeo. a happy couple. as they reach the front door and go inside, kayako turns back to the front gate. she smiles and gestures, "come on". and then toshio walks forward, through the gate. his attention is on a tiny black kitten in his arms. at the door, toshio turns to look back over his shoulder directly at karen. they hold each other's gaze for a moment, as if he somehow sees her in the ambulance. then kayako gestures to toshio, and he turns away, entering the house and closing the door.}
