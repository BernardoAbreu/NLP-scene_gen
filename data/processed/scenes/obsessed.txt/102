<L>__{interior er waiting area night}
<A>__{in a corner, derek looks haggard, being interviewed by a veteran police detective, monica reyes. reyes looks more like a middle aged suburban mom than a cop but she's very good at her job.}

<D>__{all right, mister charles, let me get}
<P>__{this straight. e) (mor}
<C>__{reyes}
<D>__{this girl you barely know, works in your office, fantasizes you're having an affair and when you reject her, she tries to commit suicide in your bed.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{i know how it sounds but, yeah, that's pretty much it.}
<C>__{reyes}
<D>__{this affair...}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{there was no affair.}
<C>__{reyes}
<D>__{so she just... made it up in her head? with no help from you?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{maybe i was too nice to her, said something she took the wrong way, i don't know. all i know is i did not lead her on.}
<C>__{reyes}
<D>__{and you had no idea she'd be at the hotel?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{none. i don't even know how she got in my room.}
<C>__{reyes}
<D>__{apparently she told one of the housekeepers she was your wife and lost her key.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{doesn't that prove she did this on her own?}
<C>__{reyes}
<D>__{all it proves is she lost her key.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{she never had a key.}
<C>__{reyes}
<D>__{look, mister charles, i don't care if you were or weren't banging this girl. i just need to get your version for my}
<C>__{d}
<C>__{reyes}
<D>__{besides, if it's a question of innocence, i'm not the one you have to convince.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{reyes}
<D>__{let's just say i wouldn't like to explain a situation like this to my husband.}
<A>__{before derek can respond, reyes sees an er doctor signalling.}
<C>__{reyes }
<D>__{i will be right back.}
<A>__{reyes goes to talk to the doctor. derek watches them talk. the doctor hands reyes a piece of paper. derek can't stand the suspense. he walks over and interrupts.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{how is she?}
<A>__{reyes nods to the doctor and takes derek aside.}
<C>__{reyes}
<D>__{they pumped her out in time. doctor says she's groggy and disoriented. probably tomorrow they'll move her out of icu and up to the fifth floor for a psychiatric evaluation. all suicides are put on 72 hour hold, it's standard.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{did she say anything?}
<C>__{reyes}
<D>__{as a matter of fact, she was lucid long enough to give the doctor a name to call in case of emergency. he wrote it down. here.}
<A>__{reyes hands derek a piece of paper. written on it is derek charles and his phone number.}
<C>__{reyes }
<D>__{still want to stick to your story?}
