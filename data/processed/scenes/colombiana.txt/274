<L>__{interior armored van day}
<A>__{don luis fumbles with the keys, grinds the ignition in his desperation. the engine turns over. don luis slams the transmission into gear, but bangs into the crumbled mercedes blocking his way. he slams the gearshift into reverse, bashes into the wall behind him, and then jerks the gear shift into drive, ramming the mercedes with a little more room. back and forth back and forth, don luis rams at the mercedes until he has made enough room to turn the van, bang past the mercedes, and smash his way out of the garage.}
