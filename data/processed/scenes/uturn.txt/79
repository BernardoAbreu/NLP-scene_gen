<T>__{snap cut to:}
<L>__{interior hallway simultaneous}
<A>__{as jake, anxiously torn, waits, there is a loud crash, followed by sounds of struggle, of murder, of death. then...}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{jake!}
<A>__{it is a desperate cry for help. jake can't help himself. he breaks into a roaring run down the hall to save his beloved.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{grace!!}
<L>__{interior bedroom simultaneous}
<A>__{jake bulls into the bedroom. it's a mess, furniture overturned, sheets and blankets all over the floor. the lights broken. waiting for him, face down on the floor, is bobby's body in a pool of liquid. a broken bottle lies nearby. bobby's body heaves in its final death throes, and then shudders quiet... over there, by the bed, is grace, who still clutches the hatchet. the look on her face is pure shock.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{well...looks like you got him, grace. that's good...that's real good. he must of slipped past me, but you got him. looks like that drifter from this morning. got to be careful who you make friends with, sweetheart.}
<A>__{jake eyes the weapon in grace's hand.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{why don't you put that down? it's all over now. put it down.}
<A>__{grace eyes the gun in jake's hand.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{go on, girl. put it down.}
<A>__{what choice does grace have? she lets the hatchet clank to the floor.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{aww, that's my grace: not about to let someone get the best of her. that's what i love about you. as dangerous as you are unpredictable.}
<A>__{behind jake, the lifeless bobby rises up from the floor, very much alive, and clobbers jake with a golf club. jake is staggered, but he's one tough old customer as he manages to spin slowly, gun still in one hand, as if to fire. before he can, grace grabs up the hatchet from the floor and drives it straight into his back. he gurgles, stunned from both sides, but it's like trying to kill rasputin. he still has the gun as bobby jumps him from the rear, trying to get his neck in a chokehold. the gun fires once, discharging into the wall. the hatchet is ripped from his back. grace watches as the two men bang into the walls in a rugged rodeo type fight, jake seeking to dislodge bobby off his back. an expression of fear and excitement in her eyes. finally the two men go crashing to the ground, rolling around, bobby maintaining his stranglehold, but calling to her, his hands full.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{grace, goddamit, do something!}
<A>__{jake's eyes rolls up at her like a beaching whale, pleading for help.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{grace...?}
<A>__{she commits. jumping into the fray, it's not clear whose side she's really on as the three of them roll across the floor, strangling, biting, hitting, spitting, scratching, gasping. it's a guignol, but the pressure from bobby's forearm is taking its toll on jake. trying to bite jake, grace bites bobby instead, but then she scratches jake's face. jake is grabbing her hard as bobby chokes him, trying to use her to leverage himself away. but she manages to rip herself from his grip and scrambles on her knees across the floor. she grabs the hatchet. and stands, moving back towards the two men locked on the floor. bobby looks up at her, hatchet in hand, no longer sure which way she'll go. jake, however, gasping for air, eyes bulging, spittle dripping from his mouth, looks at grace with some inner certainty that she will help him. he gasps the words.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{help me, grace, help...}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{like you helped her, jake?}
<A>__{grace stands there, deciding, the power of the hatchet in her hands. she raises it suddenly over the two men. it flashes downwards. deep into the gut of her husband jake, almost transfixing him to the floor. in the silence that follows, jake's eyes roll up to meet hers. but all she has for him is a cold, distant stare. jake's head drops as the life rushes out of him. bobby falls back from the body puffing and dripping with sweat.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what the hell'd you wait for?}
<A>__{she doesn't answer, turbulence in her face. he rolls jake's body off, upset. she may have made it a murder, but he was part of it, and he feels the shift in himself. they're both in new territory, feeling an apartness between them. suddenly jake gasps , still alive! it is too much for bobby. he grabs the hatchet and plunges it down on jake, silencing him one last time. grace is pushing the bed away from the wall, slipping down on her knees and prying open several floorboards.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{the money's right here! get the key!}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{no! you get it!}
<A>__{he doesn't want to get close to jake. grace coldly runs over to his corpse, ripping the chain, key and all, from the neck. the action pulls jake's head up, then she lets it thump back on the floor. she runs back to the floorboards. the top of a thick steel floor safe is revealed. bobby watches his whole life, it seems, hanging on the outcome. with the key, she opens the safe. inside are rolled up bundles of cash in hundred dollar denominations. she looks up at him, offering it as she reaches in for more. bobby also gets down on his hands and knees and grabs more and more, sucked into the fever of freedom, far more money than he lost at the grocery store, overcome now with emotions of fear and freedom. they see each other.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{didn't i tell you?}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{there must be 150, 200 thousand here! goddamnit grace, you were right!}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{we done it, bobby. oh my god!}
<A>__{they laugh excitedly and start kissing, rolling in the stacks of cash, some of which sticks to bobby's sweating back. the day didn't turn out so bad after all for bobby.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{fuck me baby!}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{what about him?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{let him watch. i want him to know what he's missing.}
<A>__{as they consummate their violent relationship for the first time, jake's lifeless eyes watch them.}
