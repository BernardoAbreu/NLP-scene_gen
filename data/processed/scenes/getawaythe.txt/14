<L>__{interior courthouse}
<A>__{carol enters a legal office, wearing a soft billowy dress. she looks very good. a middle aged secretary looks up at carol. a short balding man (the accountant) in his forties works at a large desk across the room from the secretary. he seems totally occupied with his bookwork.}
<B>__{near the accountant three men are seated on a davenport}
<A>__{they are dressed casually; by the look of them they might be anything at all but all three have commonality; they are professionals. hayhoe thirty years old, buck teeth and blue eyes, a bitter ender. cully well padded strength, large hands and wrists that pop out of his buttoned shirtsleeves... swain a little older and a little smarter than the other two, his narrow features allow no warmth.}
