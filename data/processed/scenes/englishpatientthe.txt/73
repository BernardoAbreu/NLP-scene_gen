<L>__{63. exterior basecamp at pottery hill. dusk.}
<A>__{almasy squats with an ancient arab outside his rudimentary house, while he draws on the sand, talking in some arcane dialect, scratching out a possible location for the lost oasis. the man stops speaking and scours the sky a beat or two before we or almasy hear the faint noise of a plane. it's clifton's steerman, rupert bear, coming in to land. almasy doesn't look up. the arab continues to talk. the newly arrived katharine has scrambled up the hill to speak to almasy.}
<C>__{katharine}
<P>__{(diffident)}
<D>__{hello. not to interrupt but we're celebrating.}
<A>__{she makes to leave but almasy puts up a hand to keep katharine there, but quiet.}
<C>__{almasy}
<D>__{this is an incredible story about a man hunting an ostrich, he's been telling me about zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry and now we're onto an ostrich.}
<P>__{(to the arab in arabic)}
<D>__{i'm telling her your map is poetry.}
<A>__{the arab shrugs.}
<C>__{katharine}
<D>__{what do you mean, poetry?}
<C>__{almasy}
<D>__{a mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.}
<C>__{katharine}
<D>__{sounds perfectly clear. where does the ostrich come in?}
<C>__{almasy}
<D>__{the ostrich is a detour. a poor man hunts an ostrich, it's the method. nothing to do with zerzura. to catch an ostrich you must appear not to move. the man finds a place where the ostrich feeds, a wadi, and stands where the ostrich can see him, on the horizon, and doesn't move, doesn't eat otherwise the ostrich will run. at nightfall, he moves, fifty, sixty yards. when the ostrich comes the next day, the man is there, but he's nearer.}
<P>__{(to the guide)}
<D>__{haunting the ostrich.}
<A>__{the guide speaks, amplifying something, picking at his robe.}
<C>__{almasy}
<D>__{yes, the ostrich, it will feed a family, not just the meat, but by selling the feathers, beak, the skin, a year from this one animal. so, each day the man gets closer. and the ostrich is not sure has something changed? now the standing man is only a few yards from where it feeds. and then one day, the man is in the wadi, in the water. and the ostrich comes, as always, dips into the water and the man jumps up and captures it.}
<A>__{he shrugs. the arab has more to say. almasy doesn't respond, quieting him with a dismissive gesture.}
<C>__{katharine}
<D>__{what is he saying?}
<P>__{(almasy, awkward, shakes his head)}
<D>__{come on, what did he say?}
<C>__{almasy}
<D>__{he said be careful.}
<C>__{katharine}
<D>__{be careful? you mean you or me? who?}
<C>__{almasy}
<P>__{(to the arab)}
<D>__{her or me?}
<A>__{the arab speaks again. almasy speaks without looking at her.}
<C>__{almasy}
<D>__{the one who appears not to be moving.}
