<C>__{hafiz}
<D>__{ms. macdowall, my uncle believes that trust is something you earn. and he doesn't trust anyone until he knows them very, very well..}
<A>__{he strokes her hair. she holds his eye. composed.}

<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{we need information about your uncle. contacts. shipments. if you help us, we help you. if you don't, your brother dies and tomorrow you're sitting next to your uncle in a cell in thailand and it won't be me asking the questions.}
