<T>__{in a tight series of shots:}
<A>__{the clamps are applied. the straps are drawn tight.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{roll on one.}
<A>__{the lights brighten on a rising hum. witnesses look up.}
<B>__{on the mile}
<A>__{coffey looks up as the overheads flare hotter and hotter, whispers to the mouse in his hands:}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{you be still, mr. jingles. you be so quiet and so still.}
<B>__{resume execution chamber}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{eduard delacroix, you have been condemned to die by a jury of your peers, sentence imposed by a judge in good standing in this state. you have anything to say before sentence is carried out?}
<A>__{del tries to speak. doesn't quite manage the first time. licks his lips and tries again.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{i sorry for what i do. i give anything to take it back, but i can't. god have mercy on me.}
<P>__{(whispers to paul)}
<D>__{don' forget 'bout mouseville.}
<A>__{paul and brutal nod and are stunned as:}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{no such place. that's just a fairy tale these guys told you to keep you quiet. just thought you should know, faggot.}
<A>__{the stricken look in del's eyes tells us a part of him had known all along. paul and brutal would both like to deck percy right about now, and he knows it he gives them a "what are you gonna do about it" smile. nothing they can do. paul nods to harry, who takes the black mask from the back of the chair and rolls it down over del's head, leaving the top of his shaved head exposed.}
<B>__{percy}
<A>__{takes the sponge and bends down to the bucket of brine. the other don't see it, but we do: percy only pretends to dip the sponge and soak it. it never touches the water. he straightens up and places the sponge atop delacroix's head, hiding it with his hands. the cap is lowered. paul and the others haven't yet realized what's happened. thunder booms and lightning crashes as percy hides a smile, steps back to address the condemned:}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{electricity shall now be passed through your body until you are dead, in accordance with state law. god have mercy on your soul.}
<B>__{tight on paul}
<A>__{as realization starts to dawn. he stares at the bucket, then across the floor to delacroix, coming to terms with the evidence of his eyes there's no water on the floor or dripping down the sides of del's neck. paul's eyes widen. a stunned beat of horror. he starts to open his mouth to scream "no!", but percy beats him to it with:}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{roll on two.}
<A>__{van hay flicks the switch. wham. the electricity hits home and del rocks forward, riding the current. then things start to go horribly wrong. the humming loses its steadiness and starts to waver with a crackling sound. tendrils of smoke begin curling from under the cap, a mixture of burning hair and sponge. brutal shoots paul a horrified look. paul responds with a harsh whisper:}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it's dry!}
<A>__{delacroix begins twisting and jittering in the chair, his masked face snapping violently from side to side, his legs pistoning up and down in his restraints. there's a muffled pop from under the cap, like a pine knot exploding in a hot fire. smoke starts coming through the fabric of the mask, puffing upward. del is being cooked alive. paul spins to the partition, hollering }
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{jack!}
<A>__{ but brutal grabs his arm, whispers fiercely:}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{don't you tell him to stop. don't you do it. it's too late for that.}
<A>__{paul turns back, helpless. the other guards are trading wild looks, unable to believe what's happening. even percy looks aghast he was expecting something, but not this. del begins screaming the wild, hysterical sound of an animal being shredded alive in a hay baler. the humming goes uneven and ragged, the lights rising and falling...}
<B>__{on the mile}
<A>__{...as del's screams rise and fall with them, echoing up the corridor. coffey's shaking and screaming too, as if feeling del's pain. mr. jingles squirms out of his grasp and goes squeaking in terror toward the restraint room door...}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{he's cookin' now! they cookin' him good! near about done, i reckon!}
<B>__{resume execution chamber}
<A>__{wrong. del's nowhere near about done. he's slamming back and forth in the chair hard enough to shake the platform, twisting hard against the leather restraints. we hear bones breaking. a woman's screams. witnesses start rising to their feet:}
<C>__{witnesses}
<D>__{what the hell's happening to him?...are those clamps going to hold?...christ, the smell!...is this normal?}
<A>__{the mask bursts into flame on delacroix's face. van hay hollers through the wire mesh, horrified:}
<C>__{van hay}
<D>__{should i kill the juice?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no! roll, for christ's sake, roll!}
<A>__{harry scoops up the bucket of water to throw it.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no water! no water! you crazy?}
<A>__{harry backs off with a look of dazed understanding you don't throw water on a man getting juiced. right. he drops the bucket, races to get the chemical fire extinguisher instead. the flaming mask peels away, revealing del's charring face. his eyeballs are misshapen globs of burning white jelly blown out of their sockets. the attending doctor faints dead away. pandemonium now in the room. people shouting and hurrying to exit, chairs falling over, women screaming:}
<C>__{fat lady}
<D>__{stop it, stop it, oh can't you see he's had enough?}
<A>__{hal grabs paul by the shoulder, spins him around.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{why don't you shut it down?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{he's still alive! you want me to shut down while he's still alive?}
<A>__{hal is horrified at the thought. del is jittering and screaming, rocking from side to side, smoke pouring from his nostrils and mouth, his tongue sizzling purple black. the witnesses are crowding and shoving to get out, but the back door is locked. all they can do is cluster there. paul sees percy with his head turned away. he grabs him, forces his head around.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you watch, you son of a bitch!}
<A>__{harry steps up, the extinguisher in his hands. waiting. del finally slumps over. he still vibrating, but now it's just the effect of current flowing through his body.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{kill it!}
<A>__{van hay kills the current. the humming dies. brutal grabs the extinguisher from harry, shoves it into percy's hands.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{you do it. you're running the show, ain't you?}
<A>__{percy, sick and dazed, aims the extinguisher and hoses the smoking corpse. hal is near the back, calming the crowd:}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{it's all right, folks, it's all under control. just a power surge from the storm, that's all, nothing to worry about...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{dean, get doc's stethoscope.}
<A>__{dean drops to the doctor's bag, digs through it, hands up the stethoscope. paul plugs them into his ears. people are moaning and sobbing at the back of the room:}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{oh my god! is it always like this? why didn't somebody tell me? i never would have come!}
<A>__{paul wipes some foam away from delacroix's chest, places the stethoscope pad to the raw flesh. he nods to brutal it's over.}
