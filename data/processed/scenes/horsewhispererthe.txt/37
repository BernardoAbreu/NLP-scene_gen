<A>__{the room's lights are dimmed. dawn is being to break through. grace, slowly, opens her eyes coming out of sedation. she takes a moment to figure out where she is... to remember. she uses her hands to hoist herself up, but she's unsteady and knocks into her bedside table knocking the good luck charm from india off the table. it rolls under the bed, with a water tumbler. grace never sees the charm. grace looks where her leg once was. she feels the blanket, the empty space where her leg once was... just like her mother did (did her father couldn't). instead of self pity, she's oddly fascinated.}
