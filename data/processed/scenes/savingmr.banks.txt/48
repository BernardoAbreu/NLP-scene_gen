<A>__{dick, don and pamela sit around the meeting table. bob hovers by the door in a right humph. disney prefers to stand, grazing occasionally from a bowl of candy.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{i've simply gone off the colour.}
<A>__{their mouths are agape.}
<C>__{pamela }
<D>__{you did say i was to have final say did you not?}
<C>__{disney}
<D>__{we can't make the film without the colour red! it's set in london for pete's sake.}

<D>__{and?}
<C>__{disney}
<D>__{there's buses and mail boxes and guards uniforms heck! the british flag! pamela, i'm not sure why you're }
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{i understand your predicament mr disney, i do. i just hm i don't know what it is, i'm just suddenly very anti red. i shan't be wearing it ever again.}
<A>__{disney comes and sits on the table in front of pam and locks eyes with her.}
<C>__{disney}
<D>__{is this a test pam? are you requiring proof of how badly i wanna make you happy so that we can create this beautiful thing together?}
<A>__{pamela averts her eyes for a split second, embarrassed about `creating something beautiful' with walt, but quickly recovers and eyeballs him right back.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{i took you at your word mr disney and it seems my first stipulation has been denied. there will be many more, so perhaps we should just call it quits and i should hand you back these?}
<A>__{she takes the rights agreement out of her bag and offers it to him. disney smiles at pamela.}
<C>__{disney}
<D>__{alright. no red in the film.}
<A>__{pamela glances at the tape recorder.}
