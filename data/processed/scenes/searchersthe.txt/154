<A>__{this trading post is in marked contrast to futterman's being well stocked, clean and presided over by hiram appleby, a resolute, clean looking man of middle years. ethan and martin in winter garb are being shown a variety of trade goods, including a shoebox full of ornate ribbon rosettes, such as are awarded animals at stock fairs. appleby is solemnly affirming the trade value of these, as well as sleeve garters, etc.}
