<D>__{it is my belief that mickey and mallory knox are a cultural phenomena that could only exist in our sexually repressed society. a flower that could only bloom amidst a grotesque fast food culture. a what i tried to do with 'thrill killers' was trace the root of the problem all the way down the vine to the original bad seed. yet amidst the violence and murder and carnage, you've got the structure of a wagnerian love story.}
