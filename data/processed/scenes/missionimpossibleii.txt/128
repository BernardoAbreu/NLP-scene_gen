<A>__{ethan emerges to a very crowded street. billy and luther are waiting. both look to ethan.}
<C>__{luther}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{so what did he say?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{good job. and thanks.}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{that's it? that's it? that's it?}
<C>__{luther}
<P>__{(dryly, looking at billy)}
<D>__{and the check's in the mall.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{right. just remember, mates. billy baird's the name. anything you need to get, move or watch, i'm your man.}
