<A>__{rose pulls her car up to one of many warehouses in the area and double checks the address on a scrap of paper.}
<L>__{interior cleaning supply store day}
<A>__{rose and norah enter this no frills operation. cinder block walls and concrete floors. a small tv on the front counter offers up a not so classic afternoon movie line up. as they approach, the clerk drops out of sight behind the counter. rose leans over to see the clerk on his knees searching for something small and lost.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{winston?}
<A>__{winston, 35, crudely handsome with dark unkempt hair and full lips, looks up.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{i spoke with you on the phone. i'm rose lorkowski.}
<A>__{rose sticks out her right hand. winston stands to reveal he is missing his right arm. he clumsily shakes her hand with his left.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{so, our situation is...}
<A>__{on the tv, a waitress enters the frame. rose stops. she and norah both turn and look at the tv. the waitress pours coffee and exits the frame without a word. rose and norah turn back to winston. rose continues.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{we're doing some postmortem kind of um... specialized cleaning stuff and we had this really difficult...}

<D>__{a decomp.}
<A>__{rose smiles a little too enthusiastically.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{yeah, a decomp!}
<A>__{winston motions them to follow him through the store. he indicates points of interest with a flat monotone voice.}
<C>__{winston}
<D>__{general purpose cleaners, extraction cleaners, odor control. we carry both the winzyme and the dr 450. disinfectants, stain removers and shampoos.}
<C>__{winston }
<D>__{steamers, buffers, foggers, that kinda stuff's in there, for rent or purchase. quick absorbing sawdust, good for vomit.}
<A>__{the tour ends at the back corner where respirators, safety glasses, gloves and tyvec coveralls crowd the shelves.}
<C>__{winston}
<D>__{and you've got your personal protective gear back here.}
<A>__{the door beeps as it opens. carl swanson walks in wearing his `above and beyond' polo shirt. winston returns to the counter.}
