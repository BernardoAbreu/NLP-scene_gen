<D>__{maybe i shouldn't tell you that. maybe i should tell you i wasn't scared at all. but i was...}
<P>__{(long pause)}
<D>__{enough to almost kill him.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{but you didn't.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{no. poetic justice, though.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{why?}
<A>__{no reply. hardy smiles, understanding.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{because childs is the one who shot you.}
<A>__{osborne looks up, surprised. kendall nods.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{but that came later.}
<L>__{exterior louisiana bayou last night}
<A>__{as kendall safeties his rifle and lowers it... the sound of a tremendous explosion comes from their right! kendall and childs knocked off their feet as the sky momentarily lights up with the blast as a man screams!}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{over there!}
<A>__{childs points to the right, where the dim shine of phosphorous can be seen through the trees. he drags kendall to his feet and the two take off running towards it. kendall panting and scared, ducking branches and leaping ditches as the two sprint towards the dying glow.}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{hello! hel }
<A>__{the sound of gunfire! childs tackles kendall...}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{get down!}
<A>__{they hit the deck, face down in mud. it takes them a second to realize the shots are not directed at them.}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{fuck, what the fuck is going on }
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{what do we do?}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{whoever it is isn't shooting at us...}
<A>__{he trails off. the gunfire and screaming have stopped. silence now, save for the wind and rain.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{don't want to go }
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{fine.}
<A>__{childs rises and heads towards where the sounds were. kendall, lying in the rain and mud, shivering. alone. after a moment he gets up and follows.}
