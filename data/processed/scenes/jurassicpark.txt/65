<L>__{ext off road, park morning}
<A>__{muldoon and his workers now follow the compys on foot. the compys trail off in different directions. muldoon and his workers break apart to track the different groups. a bearded worker follows his party of compys. he looks ahead and sees a small group stopped ahead. their heads are bent to the ground. a bald worker has reached another cluster of compys. kicking, he scatters them. muldoon's tracking leads him to the equipment graveyard where nedry was lost. he sees his stolen red jeep. he rushes to it. on the passenger side still sits the rocket launcher. he opens the door to retrieve it. when he leans in, his eye catches the tilted side view mirror. the image is of many compys bent over the ground. he comes around, yelling.}
