<A>__{the vampire comes running out the front door. before he is a few feet from the front of the inn, the slayer smashes through the upstairs window and lands on him. they both hit the ground, and she plants the stake right in his heart. after a moment, we hear a voice:}

<D>__{the lord giveth, and the lord taketh away. ashes, ashes...}
<A>__{she looks up.}

<D>__{... all fall down}
<A>__{there are ten or more vampires walking slowly toward her in the otherwise deserted street. at the front, maybe ten feet away, is amilyn. amilyn is a grinning jackal, a servant to the vampire king. his garb is a rotted approximation of a courtier's livery. he ambles toward the slayer, giggling, as she stands. behind her is lothos, the vampire king. his skin is deep white, and smooth. he wears a long coat his dress is not of any era. he is practically upon her before he speaks.}
<C>__{lothos}
<D>__{you must forgive amilyn. he tends to drool before supper.}
<A>__{she turns. he smiles, almost lovingly.}
<C>__{slayer}
<D>__{lothos...}
<C>__{lothos}
<D>__{you people will never learn.}
<A>__{she swings at him but he grabs her arm. amilyn laughs obnoxiously. lothos grabs the back of the slayer's head, brings her to him in a loving embrace.}
<C>__{lothos}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{we can't be stopped. this is our world now.}
<A>__{he pulls her head back swiftly, snapping her spine as her head hits the back of her legs. lightning flashes.}
