<L>__{exterior camp 8 yard day}
<A>__{a trusty bangs the rap iron. young prisoners pour from the bunkhouse and line up for breakfast. claude and ray bring up the rear, the elder statesmen of the bunch. by a long shot.}
<C>__{dillard}
<D>__{fourteen acres today and only 12 hours of daylight! eat up and move it out! gibson! banks! get your sorry asses over here!}
<A>__{claude and ray step out of line and approach dillard.}
<C>__{dillard}
<D>__{every morning i wake up praying that ray gibson and claude banks have died in their sleep and every morning you disappoint me.}
<C>__{ray and claude}
<D>__{sorry, boss.}
<C>__{dillard}
<D>__{i stand before you a defeated man. try as i might, i can't seem to break you. i swear, if they dropped a nuclear bomb on this camp, you and the cockroaches would be the only things left. but starting today at least i won't have to endure your presence any longer. you've got fifteen minutes to clear out your footlockers. you're both being reassigned to the superintendent's mansion. and i, for one, will not miss you.}
<A>__{ray and claude share a look. then ray embraces dillard, who stoically endures the breach of his personal space.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i always wanted to do that.}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{there is so much love inside of this man.}
