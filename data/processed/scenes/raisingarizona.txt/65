<A>__{five three year olds in their pajamas are opening presents around a tree as nathan and florence look on.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{...where nathan jr. was opening a present from a kindly couple who preferred to remain unknown.}
<A>__{we have been isolating in on one of the children peeling the wrappings off a package marked to nathan jr. inside is a shiny red plastic football.}

<A>__{pulled over on the state highway in the middle of the desert, a police motorcycle parked behind it. glen is leaning out the driver's window of the car talking to the state trooper who stands facing him.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{i saw glen, a few years later, still havin' no luck gettin' the cops to listen to his wild tales about me'n ed...}
<A>__{glen is grinning and talking with his hands cupped in front of him, as when he told hi about the pollack who almost stepped in the pile of shit. the trooper, in crash helmet and dark sunglasses, is listening tight lipped and stone faced as glen finishes his story and slaps his knee.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{...maybe he threw in one pollack joke too many...}
<A>__{the trooper is clicking open his ballpoint pen and reaching his citation book from his breast pocket. the name tag on the pocket says "sgt. kowalski."}

<A>__{he catches the ball and starts running.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{...taking pride in his accomplishments as if he were our own...}
<A>__{he is skillfully eluding and stiff arming tacklers.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{...wondering if he ever thought of us.}
<A>__{he reaches the end zone and triumphantly spikes the football. he whips off his helmet and we track in on the face of the rosy cheeked high school bruiser.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{...and hoping that maybe we'd broadened his horizons a little, even if he couldn't remember just how they'd got broadened.}
<B>__{back to bedroom}
<A>__{still craning down, now very close to the sleeping hi.}
