<A>__{scotty slurps a glass of chocolate quick. rinses the glass too carefully. gathers courage for something. breathes deep starts across the house.}
<L>__{interior scotty's house hallway night}
<A>__{scotty peeks through a slightly open door. bill moves around inside, unpacking boxes. scotty reaches to knock. stops. almost walks away. then musters the gumption. knocks.}

<A>__{scotty takes a few cautious steps into...}
<L>__{interior bill's den night}
<A>__{...a trophy room. ribbons, plaques, trophies. bill must've been some athlete; but he limps now. scotty lingers... gathering more courage.}

<C>__{bill}
<D>__{um hum.}
<A>__{scotty leaves, bringing the door with him on his way out. through the cracked portal he sees bill set a silver pedestal on the main shelf. on this he sets a baseball... just a baseball.}
