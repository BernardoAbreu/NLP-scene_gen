<A>__{the three burst in, all yelling at each other. they are all bleeding profusely from gun shot wounds. connor turns on the gas stove and slams a new clothing iron down on the burner. he has wrapped the cord around the handle so it won't burn. they have all ripped their clothes haphazardly and have made tourniquets to nurse their wounds.}

<D>__{who the fuck was he, rocco? i know you fuckin' know!}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{fuck you! i told you i never saw him before!}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{well he sure as fuck knew you!}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{fuck you both! ya ask me, he was aiming at you!}
<A>__{the scene fades into total silence as they viciously argue. they then take turns hold each other down as they cauterize their wounds with the hot iron. two guys will hold a third down and force a wadded up pillow case in his mouth, as they burn him}
