<L>__{exterior crossroads day later}
<A>__{willow waits uneasily, brushing flies off his face. the baby fusses and squirms. he peeks inside her diaper.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{i hate this.}
<A>__{he looks anxiously up and down the road. the baby's crying gets worse. he begins to change her.}
<L>__{exterior crossroads sunset}
<A>__{willow finishes building a fire, lighting it with flint and blowing it into flame. the baby lies quietly near by in a kind fo porta crib made of papoose and twigs. nightfall teems with spooky noises: crickets, frogs, bats, owls and howling wolves. then a terrible moan frightens him.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{i really hate this.}
<A>__{not sure where it came from. he backs away from the fire, under the rag filled cage. suddenly a hand reaches down and yanks willow up off the ground! wil low screams. the baby cries. and we see the haggard unwashed unshaven face of madmartigan pressing against the bars of the cage.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{hey, peck...get me some water...or you'll diiiiie...!}
<A>__{madmartigan shakes willow like a rag doll until willow nods his head yes. then drops him. instantly willow races around that fire, picking up everything he owns.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{i will i will getcha water getcha lotsa water anything you say !}
<A>__{willow grabs the baby and makes a beeline for the bushes.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{peck!}
<A>__{he dives headfirst into the weeds. madmartigan rattles his cage.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{you're a weasely little peck! gimme some water!}
<A>__{willow peeks at him and shakes his head.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{i'm not coming near you!}
<A>__{they stare at each other across the fire. then, mad martigan puts on a very phony smile.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{please? i'm dyin' of thirst in here.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{good. how long will it take?}
<A>__{madmartigan drops the smile and spits at the fire.}

<D>__{don't make me angry, peck.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{you be careful. i'm a powerful sorcerer. i could turn you into a toad just like that.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{miserable pecks.}
<A>__{willow throws a rock at him. it bounces off the cage. madmartigan sags down into a heap of rags again.}
