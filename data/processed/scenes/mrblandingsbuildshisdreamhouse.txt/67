<T>__{dissolve:}
<L>__{exterior the old hackett place day}
<A>__{jim, muriel and bill stand a little distance from the house, looking at it. a vast lilac spreads across it. the blandings are in quiet rapture, and it is bill who speaks first.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(frank and open)}
<D>__{well, i must admit it's a very beautiful thing.}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(misty)}
<D>__{the house and the lilac are just the same age, bill; if the lilac can live and be so old, so can the house. it just needs someone to love it, that's all.}
<A>__{three shingles slide from the roof. as jim and muriel react:}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{it's a good thing there are two of you one to love it and one to hold it up.}
<A>__{as jim gives him a look:}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{what'd your engineer say when he checked over the foundation and that roof?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{who needs engineers? this isn't a train, you know.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i just saw it move.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{this house has been standing since the second year of the continental congress. you take one look at it and shingles start to fall off!}
<A>__{as if on cue, a few more shingles slide off the roof, nearly hitting jim.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(solicitously)}
<D>__{look let me do you a favor. i've got a client, crackerjack structural engineer, joe apollonio; he practically built the george washington bridge single handed.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{thanks a lot, but we're not building a bridge.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{he's the follow who advised the government not to raise the normandie they didn't listen to him, cost them five million dollars.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you have my word, if i were raising the normandie, i wouldn't make a move without apollonio.}
<P>__{(indicates door)}
<D>__{now would you like to come inside and look around?}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(a skeptical look at the roof)}
<D>__{no thanks, i will just stay out in the car and listen to "life can be beautiful."}
<A>__{as jim opens the door and disappears, there is a crash, followed by a series of other crashes. muriel looks in, turns back to bill.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{i think you'd better contact mr. apollonio.}
