<A>__{we see the short wave radio speaker installed in the living space near the tv. a voice rattles over the unit:}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{we know you're in there... seen the whirlybird on the roof.}
<L>__{634}
<A>__{fran steps to the doorway attracted by the signal. peter sits at the radio, not knowing whether to send. steve listens.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{hey, er... could ya use some company in there?}
<A>__{steve is about to say something. peter stops him.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{we're just ridin' by... we could sure use some supplies... what's the chance us gettin' in there to stock up?}
<A>__{peter listens intently, trying to read the voice's inflections.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{how many of you in there, anyway... there's three of us. couldn't ya use three more guns?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{raiders.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{well, they know we're here, maybe we should...}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(cutting her off)}
<D>__{no chance.}
<A>__{the little puppy scrambles up to fran's feet, seeking attention. she picks the little dog up in her arms.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{well, if there's only three of them...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{who says?}
<A>__{there's a long silence. the radio sputters static. voices are heard, but they aren't speaking into the microphone. they are obviously conferring among themselves. steve starts to speak, peter cuts him off.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{shhhh! quiet!}
<A>__{he is trying to hear the muffled conversation.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{i think we should...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{jesus christ, shut up and listen!}
<A>__{more static. slight laughter is heard. steve looks into peter's face. the bug trooper just stares at the speaker without moving. finally, the voice again.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{hey... you in the mall... you just fucked up real bad! we don't like people who don't share.}
<A>__{instantly peter grabs his weapon and straps on his holster.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{come on, man... get it up.}
