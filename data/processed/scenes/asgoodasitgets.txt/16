<L>__{interior simon's apartment day}
<A>__{there is a knock at the door simon crosses to answer. he is more relaxed than we've seen him a man at peace humming to his favorite music, talking to his dog who scratches at the door. simon opens the door to vincent.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{sorry, i was out in the studio doing some work and i forgot about our appointment.}
<A>__{he leads the way back toward the studio chatting away unaware that vincent is disrobing as he follows him and eyeing the expensive apartment.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i usually make such a big deal out of picking models but carl's so thorough. i will bet he drove you nuts checking your references.}
<A>__{and he turns and sees the naked model.}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(taken aback)}
