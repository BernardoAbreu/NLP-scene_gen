<A>__{stumbles in and looks around discouraged. the place has been ransacked. the gun cabinets are empty, the gatling lamp removed. all that's left is gordon's nitro cycle and his wardrobe full of dresses. west tries every secret hiding place. nothing. finally he finds gordon's belt buckle derringer. he opens the breech. only one dinky bullet. he throws down the belt in disgust.}

<A>__{sits behind a desk that has been brought to center stage. loveless unrolls a document, signs his half of it.}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{my partner nations insist that we make this as legal as possible. personally, i like the symmetry of it. after all wasn't it you who made us sign a surrender at appomattox?}
<A>__{loveless snaps his fingers. amazonia drags grant out of his seat and sticks a pen in his manacled hands.}
<C>__{president grant}
<D>__{never will i sign that paper, never will the united states ever surrender!}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{well, sir, we're at loggerheads then, aren't we? and i suppose the threat of death to someone with your valorous war record, would mean nothing.}
<A>__{grant sets his jaw intractably. he's right about that.}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{... so, if you still refuse to sign this surrender... we'll start by shooting your man, gordon.}
<A>__{loveless whirls, nods to amazonia who drags the president back to his seat, pulls gordon out of his. rita can't help her outburst.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{artemus!}
<A>__{artemus smiles at her, extremely brave under the circumstances. he whispers to rita and the president.}
<C>__{gordon}

<D>__{don't worry, i'm wearing the impermeable.}
<A>__{rita turns to grant. what the hell is that? gordon has no time to explain as amazonia hauls him up on the stage. as munitia aims her rifle... gordon holds up a finger.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{if i may have one request... it's that she aim at my heart... which has loved this great country so much!}
<C>__{loveless}
<P>__{(considers for a moment)}
<D>__{shoot him in the head.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{great.}
<A>__{munitia cocks her rifle, then just as loveless holds his hands up for the signal to fire... the lights dim...}
