<A>__{lying on her back.}
<D>__{still all we can see are doves flashing in the light.}
<C>__{agnes }
<D>__{... dividing and dividing feathers and starts, falling, falling into the iris of god's eye. oh... oh!... it's... it's so lovely... it's so... blue... yellow... blood wings, brown, blood... and she lifts up her hands.}
<L>__{interior attic room day}
<D>__{in the present: as she lifts up her hands, agnes is}
<A>__{horrified to see two}
<D>__{holes in her palms weeping blood.}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{his blood... my god... martha and mother miriam are equally shocked.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{oh agnes... agnes runs terrified over to the walls blood pouring over her}

<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{it's bleeding... i'm bleeding... my god it won't stop, i can't get it to stop.}
<P>__{(to mother miriam)}
<D>__{let go of me, i wish you were dead.}
<C>__{martha}
<P>__{(trying to hold her)}
<D>__{agnes... agnes... agnes breaks free and runs over to another wall smearing it}
<A>__{too with blood. martha follows her.}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{stay away from me...}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of god. he did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{he frightened you and he hurt you. it's not your fault. it's his fault. tell us who he is so we can find him. stop him from doing this to other women.}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{not your fault...}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{agnes who did you see?}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{i hate him...}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{of course you do. who was it?}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{i hate him for what he did to me.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{for what he made me go through.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{i hate him.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{agnes, who did this to you? agnes flings her arms back against the wall.}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{god! it was god.}
<P>__{(sinks to her knees)}
<D>__{and now i will burn in hell because i hate him.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{agnes you won't burn in hell. it's alright to hate him.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{that's enough.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{agnes, what happened to the baby?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{she can't remember.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{what happened to the baby?}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{it was dead.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{it was alive wasn't it?}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{i don't remember.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{oh, don't do this!}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{wasn't it!}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{yes! somehow this declaration seems to calm them down somewhat.}
<A>__{mother miriam is looking utterly resigned.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{mother miriam was with you wasn't she?}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{she took the baby in her arms?}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{you saw it all didn't you?}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{and then... what did she do?}
<P>__{(no answer)}
<D>__{agnes what did she do?}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{she... left me alone with that little thing, and i looked at it, and i thought this is a mistake. but it's my mistake, not mommy's. god's mistake.}
<C>__{agnes }
<D>__{i thought i... i can save her.}
<P>__{(she raises her hands)}
<D>__{i can give her back to god.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{what did you do?}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{i put her to sleep.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{h... how?}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{i tied the cord around her neck... wrapped her in the bloody sheets... and stuffed her in the trash can. mother miriam gives a shuddering sigh, makes the sign of the}
<A>__{cross and prays. martha claps her hands lightly together once.}
