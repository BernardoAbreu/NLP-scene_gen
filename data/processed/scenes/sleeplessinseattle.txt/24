<L>__{interior living room later}
<A>__{walter is sitting on the couch as cliff shows him slides of cloud formations in guatemala. in the next room tom's at the piano and the kids are singing christmas carols.}
<L>__{interior back stairway simultaneous}
<A>__{max, one of the children, is teaching uncle milton to burp.}
<L>__{interior attic night}
<A>__{the sound of christmas carols from below. the attic is full of boxes and annie walks through with her mother. they come to a dressmakers dummy with a sheet over it. barbara removes the sheet. a beautiful antique dress. a veil sitting on top of the dummy.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{the historical society wanted this and i never would give it to them }
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{granny's dress. oh, mom.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{i notice these things are back in fashion. oh, honey.}
<P>__{(tears are rolling down}
<D>__{her face as she tries}
<P>__{the veil on annie)}
<D>__{he's a lovely man, annie.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i know. he's wonderful, isn't he?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{are his folks nice?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{you'll love them. we're going down to d.c. tonight to be with them christmas morning.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{how did it happen?}
<A>__{barbara starts to unbutton the tiny buttons on the back of the dress and remove it from the dummy.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{it's silly, really. i mean, i'd seen him at the office, obviously i'd seen him, he's the associate publisher, and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place, and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat, which of course he was allergic to, and i got his lettuce and tomato on white.}
<C>__{barbara}
<P>__{(utterly without irony)}
<D>__{how amazing.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{it is, isn't it? you make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{destiny takes a hand.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{oh, please. destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? how many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{it wasn't a sign. it was a coincidence.}
<A>__{barbara shrugs, slips the dress off the dummy and annie steps into it. barbra starts to button the dress on annie.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{i was in atlantic city with my family. cliff was a waiter. he talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the steel pier. i've probably told you this a million times, but i don't care. and then he held my hand. i was scared. all sorts of thing were going through my head. but after a while i forgot about them. at one point i looked down, at our hands, and i couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his. and i knew.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(hearing it for the first time)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{you know.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(she doesn't know, but}
<D>__{she doesn't want her mother to know she}
<P>__{doesn't know)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{magic. it was magic.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(repeating)}
<D>__{magic.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{i knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about walter. walter. it's quite a formal name, isn't it?}
<P>__{(lowering her voice)}
<D>__{one of the things i truly knew was that your father and i were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack i believe you call it }
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{mom!}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while }
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{mom, we already...}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{well, fine, fine. fiddle da dee. and how's it working?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{like... clockwork.}
<A>__{she turns to look in the mirror. the dress doesn't fit at all. it's completely lopsided. one shoulder is higher than the other. the waist is in the wrong spot. the effect is quite comical.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{so you'll get married in a new dress.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{it's a sign.}
<C>__{barbara}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{you don't believe in signs.}
