<A>__{thud! parker lands hard and sound instantly returns to her. she rolls to the side as the chair crashes down in her very spot. she is in tremendous pain but feels the solid ground beneath her like a sailor who has found land for the first time in years. surveying the damage her ankle is badly broken underneath the side of the chair that landed on it. her boot is at an unnatural angle. adrenaline overtakes her pain as she lifts the chair up and removes her foot from beneath it. she looks around for her snow board, but with all of the fresh snowfall it is buried and gone. parker lays her body down flat on her jacket and begins to push herself down the mountainside as quickly as she can.}
