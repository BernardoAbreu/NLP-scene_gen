<L>__{exterior children's orphanage day}
<A>__{and we see sam, betty and rose leading a group of children, their hands covering their eyes so they can't see, into a clearing behind one of the dorms.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{keep em closed! a little bit more!}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(arabic)}
<D>__{keep your eyes closed.}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(stern, arabic)}
<D>__{michael! cover your eyes! no peeking!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{... keep comin'...}
<A>__{the children inching forward, following his voice, until...}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{ok, stop! open your eyes!}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(arabic)}
<D>__{open your eyes!}
<A>__{and we see a hundred little eyes popping open, staring at something off screen, confused for a split second at what they're looking at. reverse to see a playground: two or three battered swingsets, a few see saws, and a jungle gym soldered out of metal pipe. and the kids sprinting for it, climbing all over the jungle gym like ants... hitting the swing sets... and then we hear it... something we realize we haven't heard in this place before... the sound of laughter... children losing themselves in play. innocence flooding back. and now we see nineteen, a.j. and two other spla soldiers standing around a bunny bouncer... staring at it quizzically... talking in arabic, trying to decide what this thing is... and then a.j., the bravest, slings his ak onto his back and carefully straddles the bouncer... pulling up his long legs and resting his feet on the pegs... and he begins to bob back and forth... holding onto the bunny's ears with his big hands... the other soldiers starting to laugh as he bobs faster... and then we see a.j's smile... a million watt smile on this guy... the first time he's played like this since he was a boy.}
