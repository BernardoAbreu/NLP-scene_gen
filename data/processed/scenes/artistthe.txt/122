<D>__{she rushes into the living room and stops for a moment to look at george. george awkwardly tries to hide the pistol behind him. she bursts into tears. title card: i feel so awful. i only wanted to help you. to take care of you... he seems to reply that no, it's not her fault, she's got nothing to feel bad about. he opens his arms towards her, still holding the pistol and the gun fires itself. fortunately no one is hurt, but the incident makes peppy laugh and, between sobs and gasps of laughter she throws herself into george's arms. they hug for a long time. peppy says into his ear, title card: you've got so much that no one else has... and into her ear, george replies: title card: no, i'm nothing but a shadow. no good for anything but silence. peppy doesn't reply. she just holds him tighter still and closes her eyes. jack is sitting close by, watching them and wagging his tail. outside, the shutter is still slamming and the car is still shuddering. peppy opens her eyes. visibly, she's had an idea. jack wags his tail and thumps it on the ground. the shutter slams. the car shudders. peppy smiles at george. title card: i know what you have that no one else does. peppy moves away from george and motions to him to listen. the shutter slams. jacks tail thumps. the car shudders... peppy does a few tap steps. george doesn't understand. peppy starts again, with a beaming smile, waiting for his response. george does a few tap steps himself, basic ones, without any great enthusiasm. she smiles at him and does a few more complex steps that are a lot livelier. he smiles back finally understanding the golden gift that he has in his feet. he looks at peppy lovingly with a beaming smile on his face.}
