<A>__{the music fades. we see lorl, dressed in a walking cloak, sitting before a desk, talking to someone confidentially.}
<C>__{lorl}
<D>__{they're out every night, sir. till all hours.}
<A>__{a hand comes into frame offering a plate of sugared biscuits. on its finger we see the gold signet ring belonging to salieri.}

<D>__{oh, thank you, sir.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{do any pupils come to the house?}
<C>__{lorl}

<D>__{then how does he pay for all this? does he work at all?}
<C>__{lorl}
<D>__{oh, yes, sir, all day long. he never leaves the house until evening. he just sits there, writing and writing. he doesn't even eat.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{really? what is it he's writing?}
<C>__{lorl}
<D>__{oh, i wouldn't know that, sir.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{of course not. you're a good girl. you're very kind to do this. next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?}
