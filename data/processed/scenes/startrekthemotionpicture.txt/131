<A>__{the door snapping open, and "ilia", mccoy and decker entering. then camera reveals chapel already inside, looking through some female adornments she's found there.}
<C>__{chapel}
<D>__{i remember lt. ilia once mentioning that she wore this...}
<C>__{decker}
<P>__{(reacting; tight)}
<D>__{... when we met.}
<A>__{clearly this is very painful to decker. meanwhile, chapel hands the deltan headband to "ilia".}
<C>__{chapel}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{put it on.}
<A>__{"ilia" hasn't the slightest idea what to do with the headband, holds it, runs her fingers over the jewels and feathers embedded into it. chapel takes it from her, places it on 'ilia's" head, now switches on the light illuminating the dressing table mirror stands behind her with decker, both watching apprehensively. angle on "ilia" studying her image in the mirror, her face totally blank a moment, but then breaking into a bemused frown as though trying to remember. and:}
<C>__{chapel}
<P>__{(helpfully)}
<D>__{ilia...}
<C>__{decker}
<P>__{(quiet; urging)}
<D>__{on delta... remember...?}
<A>__{and it seems that "ilia" does remember. she peers at her image, then sets the headband into its exact proper position. then she turns and looks at them with recognition.}
<D>__{"ilia"}
<P>__{(haltingly)}
<D>__{dr. chapel...}
<B>__{across chapel to decker}
<A>__{as chapel smiles, pleased, and looks at decker who stares at "ilia" nonplussed. this is ilia coming alive!}
<D>__{"ilia"}
<P>__{(to decker)}
<D>__{"will..."}
<A>__{and she touches his hand, runs her own hand over it, and smiles. decker is completely overwhelmed, struggles for words and looks to mccoy for some kind of help. mccoy realizes decker is losing himself in fantasy.}
<D>__{mccoy}
<P>__{(gently reminding)}
<D>__{commander... this is a mechanism...}
<A>__{decker is startled, and for another slit second he's lost but then he realizes the reality, and what he should do:}
<C>__{decker}
<P>__{(gently; but urgingly)}
<D>__{ilia, help us make direct contact with v'ger... "ilia i... cannot.}
<A>__{decker looks at "ilia's" hand still resting on his. then:}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{then tell us who v'ger is; where he's from... w need your help.}
<A>__{for another moment "ilia" continues smiling at decker, holding his hand. then, abruptly, the smile vanishes the hand is released. clearly, she's again the probe, as:}
<D>__{"ilia" why have two carbon units entered v'ger...?}
<A>__{decker glances at mccoy, who shakes his head almost imperceptibly: he doesn't know. but decker has an obvious reply:}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{they want to make contact with v'ger...}
<P>__{(trying to revive}
<D>__{"ilia's" memory again;}
<P>__{touches her hand)}
<D>__{ilia...}
<A>__{"ilia" peers at him blankly, allows him to continue touching her hand, but obviously it means nothing to her.}
<C>__{decker}
<P>__{(continuing;}
<D>__{distressed,}
<P>__{to "ilia")}
<D>__{does v'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units? "ilia" the carbon units are of no consequence; v'ger will determine their purpose. mccoy their purpose is to survive. "ilia" that is also v'ger's purpose.}
<A>__{decker's face reflects his bemusement:}
<C>__{decker}
<D>__{you said v'ger's purpose was to find and join with the creator. "ilia" that is how v'ger will survive.}
<B>__{on decker}
<A>__{as now, the bemusement changes to just the slightest enlightenment.}
<D>__{"ilia" i wish to continue my observations.}
