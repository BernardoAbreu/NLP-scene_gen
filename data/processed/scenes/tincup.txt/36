<C>__{tin cup }
<D>__{he's taking her to miami for the fucking doral! how am i supposed to compete with that?}

<A>__{romeo ponders tin cup's dilemma from the couch.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{man, you are having a bad week.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{she must think i'm such a nothing, such a loser... a lousy driving range pro living in a winnebago, making five bucks an hour plus lessons.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{she don't know you live in a winnebago.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{well, she sure as hell knows i ain't taking her to no doral for massages and mimosas all weekend. i gotta do something with my life.}
<A>__{he reflects deeply while romeo shrugs.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{i gotta rise to a level worthy of the women that think i'm a joke.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{well... you could go out and win the open.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<P>__{(pausing, as if jarred)}
<D>__{romeo, that idea has promise.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{i was joking.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{i ain't.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{we talking about the same tournament? the u.s. open? the biggest golf tournament in the world?}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{not just the biggest golf tournament in the world; the most democratic.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{i mean it's open. anyone's got a shot at it. you just gotta get past a local and a sectional qualifier, and unlike doral or colonial or the a.t.t., they can't keep you out. they can't ask you if you're a garbageman or a bean picker or a driving range pro whose check is signed by a stripper. you qualify, you're in.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{and then you pay out of your own pocket to go there and get all nervous and intimidated }
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{who's intimidated? i just told you i'm gonna win the damn thing!}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{you don't got the game.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{i got every shot in the book.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{i said you don't got the game. the mental game. the head game.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{you suggesting i err on the side of excess?}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{you always go out to shoot zero. sometimes you pull it off. but you can't play like that at the open. you win by taking what the course gives you. you win by being humble, which you aren't, and patient, which you never will be.}
<A>__{tin cup comes over to the couch, sits down, and puts an arm around romeo.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{well, since you're the authority, how'd you like to teach me how to be what i ain't and never will be?}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{you don't ever listen to me.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{this time'll be different. i promise.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{i don't know, man. right now you don't even got the money to get your clubs out of hock.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{yeah, well... my sticks may be in a pawn shop, but i got a rake and a hoe at the range.}
