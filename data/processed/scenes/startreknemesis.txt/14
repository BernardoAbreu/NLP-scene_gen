<A>__{geordi is at the engineering station with picard, riker and data.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{it's very faint but i've isolated it to the third planet in the kolarin system.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{what do we know about the planet?}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{uncharted. we'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(to data)}
<D>__{theories?}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on kolarus iii.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{how many of you did dr. soong make?}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{i thought only me, myself and lore.}
<C>__{riker}
<P>__{(looking at star chart)}
<D>__{diverting to the kolarin system takes us awfully close to the romulan neutral zone.}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(looking at star chart)}
<D>__{still well on our side...}
<A>__{picard glances at data, recognizes the android's deep desire to explore this possible connection to others like himself.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{i think it's worth a look. don't worry, number one, we'll get you to betazed with time to spare.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{thank you, sir...}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(to all, especially worf)}
<D>__{where we will all honor the betazoid traditions. no cold feet, or any other parts of our anatomy. now, if you'll excuse me. i will be in the gym.}
<A>__{he goes.}
<C>__{riker}
<P>__{(to helm officer)}
<D>__{mister branson, set course for the kolarin system. warp five }
<P>__{(deanna shoots him a glance)}
<D>__{ warp seven.}
<C>__{helm officer }
<D>__{plotted and laid in, sir.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{engage.}
<C>__{deanna}
<D>__{you better believe you're engaged!}
<A>__{meanwhile, geordi and data remain at the engineering station, studying the displays.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{what do you think, data, a long lost relative?}
<A>__{data doesn't respond, but the curiosity on his face is apparent.}
