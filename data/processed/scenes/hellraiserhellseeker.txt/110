<L>__{exterior bridge day}
<A>__{the car goes off the bridge landing in the water. kirsty's head breaks the surface. she watches the car sink into the river.}
<D>__{back to:}
<L>__{interior morgue}
<A>__{trevor stares at his own dead body in utter disbelief. the sewer monsters begin crawling up his legs. pinhead smiles.}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{nooo!!}
<A>__{the scream echoes over trevor's dead self, which seems so tranquil in contrast. hold on the corpse. after a beat the bells stop, as does the rumbling and the cracking. the lights brighten. serenity. then:}
<C>__{kirsty's voice}
<D>__{yes. yes that's him.}
<A>__{reverse angle on kirsty looking down at the corpse wiping her eyes. she looks over to the other side of the body where trevor and pinhead had been standing. where now detective lange and the coroner dr. ambrose had been standing. the two gentlemen look at each other.}
<C>__{lange}
<D>__{well i guess that's it then. thank you mrs. gooding i realize that must have been tough.}
<A>__{lange escorts kirsty to the door. they exit but not before kirsty gives her late husband a parting glance. ambrose covers trevor's body and looks off camera.}
<C>__{dr. ambrose}
<D>__{alrighty. let's get started folks.}
<A>__{reverse on two other doctors who are busying themselves collecting instrument. allison and sage. they walk over to trevor's body and get to work. sage sticks a needle in trevor's arm.}
<C>__{sage}
<D>__{collecting 40ccs of serum...}
<C>__{ambrose}
<D>__{examining cranial fracture...}
<A>__{allison at his side, ambrose checks the wound on trevor's head, pauses to look inside trevor's eyes. trevor's pov: ambrose closing the eyelid again.}
<C>__{ambrose }
<D>__{checking oral cavity for blockage...}
<A>__{ambrose opens trevor's mouth.}
<C>__{ambrose }
<D>__{and we have a winner...}
<A>__{ambrose pulls a long black dead lamprey out of trevor's mouth. looks at the slippery creature for a moment.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{looks like an eel of some kind.}
<C>__{ambrose}
<D>__{guess it was murder after all.}
<C>__{sage}
<D>__{yeah all we need is the eel's motive.}
<A>__{allison holds out a large freezer bag, into which ambrose dumps the dead lamprey.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{i still don't get it. he's been missing for almost eight months. but this body hasn't been dead more than twenty four hours.}
<C>__{dr. ambrose}
<D>__{makes you wonder what he was up to between the time he disappeared and when he died.}
<A>__{allison walks right up to the corpse's face.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{well? what do you say trevor? que pasa?}
<C>__{dr. ambrose}
<P>__{(shivering)}
<D>__{allison what on earth possesses you to converse with cadavers?}
<C>__{sage}
<P>__{(looking at trevor's corpse)}
<D>__{it's simple, dr. ambrose. what if there is no afterlife? what happens when we die? do we just stay stuck inside your bodies for eternity watching ourselves decompose?}
<C>__{ambrose}
<D>__{i'm not following this...}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{well if that's the case... wouldn't you want someone to talk to you like a normal human being one last time?}
<C>__{ambrose}
<D>__{you two are creeping me out. and i'm a coroner.}
<A>__{allison fixes a stray lock of hair on trevor's forehead. quick cuts: allison slipping a tag on trevor's toe; sliding trevor's body into the morgue drawer; her hand turning the lock on the drawer.}
<C>__{allison }
<D>__{adios amigo.}
