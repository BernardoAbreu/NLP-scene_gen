<A>__{the up button is lit. clear rushes to the lobby. the elevator rises! inside the elevator, eugene watches nora's head drop to floor level then he pounds the emergency button which shorts out! nora's body lifts upwards from the force of the elevator floor! nora's screams of terror and agony fill the air as the elevator repeatedly lurches upwards. kat gasps in horror to see this poor woman suspended above the floor. it lurches. and lurches. and lurches. the horror never ends. clear comes from the stairwell and is shocked by the sight. she runs to the elevator doors, trying to pry them apart to no avail. all kat can do, crying, is grab hold of nora's flailing legs and try to pull her back down. the elevator lurches a final time. nora's headless body fall down into kat's arms, knocking her to the floor. kat freaks, skittering away as the body convulses.}

<A>__{eugene balls his hands to his mouth in undeniable fear. a bloodcurdling moan escapes him. he stares transfixed as nora's head, still aghast in terror, rolls around the floor. the sight clearly sends eugene over the edge. he screams, claws and pounds, desperate to escape the elevator.}
