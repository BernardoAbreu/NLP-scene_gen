<L>__{interior palm night}
<A>__{the scabskins are all being served dinner in a private room. mickey lee is served a steak the size of a briefcase. andre and jamal get lobsters big enough to be pets. ed o'neil is being fed pureed asparagus by augustine. when augustine drops the napkin and bends over, o'neil whispers urgently to cochran who is enjoying a steak:}
<C>__{o'neil}
<D>__{i will give you 50 thousand dollars for a bite of that steak!}
<A>__{mcginty taps his glass at the head of the table and stands.}
<D>__{mcginty alright, listen up: there have been a lot of rumors about the regular players crossing the picket lines. they are not rumors. many union players have now seen the error of their ways and are coming back in droves. apparently, they have been struck with the realization that it is a blessing to be playing professional football.}
<A>__{there is dead silence in the room. everybody thinks it's over.}
<D>__{mcginty but they had their chance. now it's your turn. mister o'neil and i have agreed to ban all striking players and to continue to go with you guys.}
<A>__{there's a beat and then everyone breaks into cheers. suddenly, the door flies open and a reporter and a cameraman step in and start filming. the reporter shoves a microphone at mcginty.}
<C>__{reporter}
<D>__{coach, what will be your strategy against new york this sunday?}
<A>__{out in the restaurant, patrons see the players and a few break into "hail to the redskins." suddenly, the whole restaurant starts singing. shane looks embarrassed. pacifico stands up on his seat, and conducts the singing. andre and jamal hold their lobsters in the air and make them dance to the song.}
