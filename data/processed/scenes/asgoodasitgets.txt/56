<A>__{and so she does. wow does she... and gives us some notion of the size of her fear demon and the strength it takes to subdue it as dr. bettes keeps reassuring her and she keeps nodding... finally a deep breath as spencer enters from the bathroom. all at hyper speed now. salvation as farce.}

<D>__{no.}
<A>__{she starts towards spencer's room.}
<C>__{dr. bettes}
<D>__{you don't have to do it this second... it's not dangerous or anything. it's just something that's advisable. look, there's a lot to be checked but... hey, your son is going to feel a good deal better at the very least...}
