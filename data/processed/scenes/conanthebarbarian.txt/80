<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior zingaran galley morning}
<A>__{tamara steps out onto the deck, grabbing her pounding head. her first hangover. she hears a thumping sound, followed by another, and walks towards the side of the deck. tamara looks overboard, to the water below.}
<C>__{tamara's pov}
<A>__{the river is filled with bodies! bloated, they float in blood red water as flies buzz around them. one of them hits the hull of the boat. thump. tamara blinks, unsure if the vision is real but then she's joined by other pirates who gape at the bodies below.}
<C>__{pirate 1}
<D>__{to stations! to stations!}
<A>__{tamara turns and up ahead spies }
<B>__{black warship}
<A>__{the larger warship cuts through the water, manned by a legion of rowers. on the deck of the warship, ukafa and his spearmen stand. the sailors get the most out of the billowing black sails. the ship gains fast.}
<B>__{the galley}
<A>__{conan exits his room, sees the danger. artus appears at his side.}
<C>__{artus}
<D>__{what do you think? they have us outnumbered, but we might beat their speed.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{that is what they wish. they drive us to another force, approaching from the south.}
<C>__{artus}
<D>__{then we fight?}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{no. we give them what they think they want.}
<P>__{(to the pirates)}
<D>__{about ship! now!}
<A>__{the pirates leap into action, tacking and turning the galley with great speed and efficiency.}
<B>__{the warship}
<A>__{ukafa smiles, his gold teeth shining. the ship's captain stands beside him.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{they're turning to run.}
<C>__{ukafa}
<D>__{good. we only need stay close.}
<B>__{the galley}
<A>__{is turned around now, fleeing. archers from the warship fire arrows that barely reach the galley. the pirates dodge the few that land on deck. tamara reaches conan and artus. she's worried to say the least.}
<C>__{artus}
<D>__{and now?}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{let us show them why she is called the wasp.}
<A>__{artus smiles. he was hoping conan would say that.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{why is she called the wasp?}
<C>__{artus}
<D>__{open astern! load the stinger!}
<A>__{the pirates rush to the back of the ship.}
<B>__{the black warship}
<A>__{the captain stares ahead, confused.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{they are doing something.}
<A>__{sure enough, the stern of the ship begins to part, revealing }
<B>__{a massive crossbow}
<A>__{mounted with a barbed harpoon, fifteen feet long.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{fire!}
<A>__{they fire the weapon. the harpoon races for the bow of the warship, a thick rope trailing it. it smashes into the wood, ripping through it like it was paper.}
<C>__{conan }
<D>__{rip her apart!}
<A>__{the pirates grab the heavy rope and run, pulling the rope, and the harpoon back towards the wasp. as it's pulled out, the barbs of the harpoon rip a wider hole in the warship.}
<B>__{warship}
<A>__{the captain and crew are in a panic. men rush to patch the gaping hole in the hull.}
<C>__{sailor}
<D>__{we're taking on water!}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{hard to port!}
<C>__{ukafa}
<D>__{no. let them fire again!}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{we will sink.}
<A>__{ukafa guts the captain with his spear.}
<C>__{ukafa}
<D>__{so be it.}
<P>__{(to his spearmen)}
<D>__{get below. be ready.}
<B>__{galley}
<A>__{the pirates load the harpoon in the crossbow device a second time.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{fire!}
<A>__{it fires, smashing again into the wooden hull of the warship. warship inside the harpoon lodges deep inside the hull where ukafa and his spearmen wait.}
<C>__{ukafa}
<D>__{now!}
<A>__{they rush forward and grab onto the harpoon.}
<C>__{galley}
<C>__{artus}
<D>__{bring her back!}
<A>__{again, the pirates pull the harpoon back out. it falls into the water as they pull on the rope tied to it. they do not notice ukafa and his dozen spearmen clasping the very same rope as its pulled toward the galley. artus looks at the warship. it's foundering and sinking quickly.}
<C>__{artus }
<D>__{she's dead in the water!}
<A>__{a cheer goes up among the pirates and then one pirate takes a spear through the chest. all eyes turn to the side of the wasp, where ukafa and his men climb aboard. conan's eyes alight with fury.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{good. i was growing weary with boredom.}
<A>__{conan motions to a pair of pirates.}
<C>__{conan }
<D>__{hide her below.}
<B>__{battle}
<A>__{the spearmen rush to the attack. the pirates spring to the defense of the ship, countering the spearmen with cutlass and dagger. ukafa marshals his men as a fierce battle rages.}
<C>__{ukafa}
<D>__{find the girl!}
<A>__{the spearmen quickly make their way to the interior of the galley, throwing the dead bodies of the pirates overboard.}
<B>__{conan}
<A>__{conan grabs the nearby jib, swings over, and plants both feet in the face of one of the spearmen, knocking him over the side.}
<B>__{artus}
<A>__{the sea captain proves dangerous in his own right, grabbing the head of one of the spearmen and violently pulling it down to the gunwale of the ship, impaling the spearman's eye on a handspike.}
<B>__{ukafa}
<A>__{the massive warrior shows incredible speed as well, dodging one cutlass attack only to turn the weapon upon another pirate.}
<B>__{conan}
<A>__{the cimmerian cuts through a spearman, his gaze focused on ukafa. ukafa stares right back as he runs through a pair of pirates. finally, the two warriors stand only feet apart. the two warriors eye each other with satisfaction. ukafa's frightening, sharpened gold teeth shine as he smiles.}
<C>__{ukafa }
<D>__{we are each the last of our tribe, cimmerian. yours dies this day.}
<A>__{conan responds by lunging forward, swinging his sword in a broad arc. ukafa is just as quick, stepping back and allowing his spear to block the swing. ukafa whirls the war spear in great circles, forcing conan to parry, stepping back beyond the spear's reach. the two powerful warriors trade blows back and forth, neither able to gain the advantage.}
<C>__{ukafa }
<D>__{your head will top my spear today, but know khalar's pig son will soon share your fate.}
<A>__{ukafa tries to spear conan through the chest, and conan decides to drop his sword, grabbing the spear as it passes by him. conan then pulls on the spear, throwing ukafa off his balance, towards conan. conan then kicks the warrior in the chest, hurtling ukafa backwards. now conan turns the spear on its master. ukafa, unarmed, is forced to backpedal as conan thrusts the spear at him. a pair of close misses leaves ukafa with gashes on his chest and arm, but he manages to knock the spear from conan's hands. the battle goes to hand to hand. it's primal, each of them covered in blood. ukafa bear hugs conan, then resorts to using his teeth to bite into conan's shoulder. conan yells in pain, butting ukafa's head and knocking him back. conan falls to the stern of the ship, his back against the harpoon crossbow. ukafa shakes off the head butt, and sees his spear nearby. he picks it up.}
<C>__{ukafa }
<D>__{now finally, you die.}
<A>__{he raises up to hurl the spear through conan, only to see conan manning the harpoon, now turned to face ukafa. the crossbow fires and the harpoon punches a massive hole through ukafa, its momentum throwing him off the galley, into the sea beyond.}
<B>__{tamara}
<A>__{she hides inside a small compartment of the ship. she hears footsteps walking past, then returning. an arm suddenly reaches in and grabs her. as she's pulled out, tamara screams right in conan's face. he doesn't even flinch.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{time to go.}
