<L>__{interior trading floor morning}
<A>__{the floor is totally empty. slow guitar music playing. the camera glides along the empty floor scanning over the many different empty trading stations and the hundreds of computer screens. it turns the corner and then finally enters sam's office.}
<L>__{interior sam's office continuous}
<A>__{he is totally asleep. he has headphones on and looks like he could be dead he is so passed out. the music suddenly changes pace and the volume change startles him up. he looks around. he takes the headphones off, music stops. he finally stands up and mildly limps his way out the office}
