<L>__{interior carr's office atlanta baseball stadium day}
<A>__{a huge office with a glass wall that looks out over the diamond. we are high above the outfield; if god was a baseball fan, this would be his office. we now meet avington carr, a very righteous and self satisfied, wealthy, southern gentlemen.}
<C>__{mr. carr}
<D>__{i never wanted that fuckin' airline. neither did my brother.}
<A>__{carr scans the room, reading faces, holding court.}
<C>__{mr. carr }
<D>__{it was my father that wanted it. i like baseball.}
<A>__{ornate, wood furniture helps to announce the political feel of mr. carr's world. presidential photos and commendations pepper the walls. it's quiet...}
<C>__{hugh lang}
<D>__{i like baseball.}
<A>__{everyone looks to hugh as it gets oddly silent... we get our first look at len caldwell, the president of the pilots' union. len tries to wrest some control and exude some confidence.}
<C>__{len caldwell}
<D>__{everyone in georgia likes baseball.}
<C>__{mr. carr}
<D>__{yeah...so what's the deal lenny? is your union gonna survive this one? more importantly? how big a check you think i'm gonna have to write?}
<C>__{len caldwell}
<D>__{there were 6 fatalities on the plane }
<C>__{hugh lang}
<D>__{the 2 crew members don't get settlements like the passengers. that's a workman's comp claim, part of the union contract they do a dangerous job and they know it.}
<C>__{mr. carr}
<D>__{you're the lawyer for the pilots' union?}
<C>__{len caldwell}
<D>__{no, this is hugh lang, the attorney we brought in to handle the criminal side of captain whitaker's situation.}
<C>__{mr. carr}
<D>__{yes, and what is mr. whitaker's situation? ntsb is up my ass with a flashlight. we had to give them access to everything.}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{and everyone is curious about captain whitaker.}
<A>__{through a glass wall we see...}
<B>__{whip sits on a couch reading a magazine in a reception area.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i flew with him. he's a great pilot.}
<C>__{mr. carr}
<D>__{is he a drunk?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{he's a heavy drinker. should i bring him in?}
<A>__{everyone steals glances at whip as carr continues to dominate.}
<C>__{mr. carr}
<D>__{in a minute. alright, so let's get down to it, lenny. what does the union plan to do about this blood test that says whitaker was high on booze and coke? this guy's a real peach.}
<C>__{hugh}
<D>__{i'm gonna kill the toxicology report.}
<P>__{(feels eyes of disbelief)}
<D>__{it was done incompetently. the last time the toxicology equipment they used was calibrated was in june of 2009, which is 18 months past code. their log that should clearly state who labeled the blood vials and when, is very incomplete. and they aren't sure who stored them. they used a preservative in the vials that has in some cases caused blood to ferment and register higher in an alcohol test. that's what i've done so far. i can handle this.}
<C>__{mr. carr}
<D>__{i like this guy lenny. he makes me wanna go out and sniff a few lines and fly a jet.}
<C>__{len caldwell}
<D>__{mr. carr, we're gonna fight to push all the fault on jackson ridgefield, the manufacturer.}
<C>__{mr. carr}
<D>__{oh and you think they're gonna just open their check book and buy us all lunch? good fucking luck. what's my exposure jim?}
<C>__{carr's business guy}
<D>__{the awards to the families could kill the airline.}
<C>__{mr. carr}
<D>__{fuck the airline. the insurance companies can have the goddamm airline. i just don't want them to come sniffing in my other pockets.}
<C>__{len caldwell}
<D>__{speaking for the pilots' union? we don't want your airline to go away. we enjoy your contract with us and we will protect captain whitaker and in turn protect your airline.}
<C>__{mr. carr}
<D>__{that's sweet mr. caldwell, but if the ntsb leaks that toxicology report showing my pilot was flying that plane drunk? we're all fucked.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{so far we've been lucky.}
<C>__{mr. carr}
<D>__{lucky?! are you that goddammed dumb?! you think they're waiting for a light news day to splash the headline, "drunk, coke addled pilot crashes a plane?!"}
<A>__{everyone goes quiet as carr's anger commands silence.}
<C>__{mr. carr }
<D>__{my brother's in dc on his knees at the foot of the throne begging for forgiveness. and so far it's working. they've got their boot on the neck of this girl ellen block runnin' the show for the ntsb and she is pissed. can you handle that?}
<A>__{hugh can't stifle a laugh. they look to him.}
<C>__{hugh lang}
<D>__{trust me, i'm gonna kill the toxicology report. that's my job.}
<A>__{carr looks to his lawyer who nods...}
<C>__{carr's attorney}
<D>__{i wish you luck, but we're still sorting out the best way to go forward legally. we might split from you and go it alone.}
<A>__{carr stands to signal the end of the meeting. hugh stands to stop him.}
<C>__{hugh lang}
<D>__{to go it alone? without us? that would be what the french call "a big fucking mistake."}
<C>__{mr. carr}
<D>__{does whitaker know he's going to jail?}
<C>__{hugh lang}
<D>__{i haven't had a client go to jail yet.}
<C>__{mr. carr}
<D>__{he's going to jail. he belongs in jail. you bet your ass he's going to jail, the question is...is he gonna die in jail?}
<C>__{hugh lang}
<D>__{you're wrong, mr. carr.}
<C>__{carr's attorney}
<D>__{last time i checked, 6 counts of manslaughter is life in prison.}
<C>__{mr. carr}
<D>__{life in prison, what we in georgia call "all day long."}
<A>__{it goes quiet as everyone reflects on that reality.}
