<A>__{the waiter sets down the cake at the center of a round table. there's a cheer and applause as the song ends. wills cannot see whose birthday it is because the waiter blocks his view. just as wills is about to exit the room, the waiter steps away. wills glances over and sees the birthday girl. at first he can't place her, but then he does, and his face softens and brightens. it's charlotte. she wears a black velvet dress and a wonderfully eccentric hat. her eyes glow in the candlelight. through the chorus of voices, urging her to make a wish, she cries out }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{you guys! let me think!}
<P>__{(concentrating)}
<D>__{okay. okay.}
<A>__{charlotte blows hard, and, with a little more effort than you might expect, extinguishes the candles. everyone applauds and cheers. to charlotte's right sits simon loring, late 20's, english, sardonic, adoring. he gestures at her chest and says }
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{watch carefully, everyone they ought to begin emerging any moment now.}
<A>__{everyone laughs. charlotte playfully slaps him }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{very funny! actually, any moment now you're gonna turn straight and fall at my feet.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{oh, darling, you know i would if i could.}
<A>__{charlotte's best friend, shannon harris, 19, a spoiled but big hearted redhead, drowning in curls, mutters }
<C>__{shannon}
<D>__{the only time he falls at your feet now is when he wants to borrow your prada loafers.}
<A>__{more laughter. back to wills. he considers approaching charlotte, but then he looks back and sees eriko sitting alone at their table, idly stabbing at her drink with a straw. regretting his rudeness, he takes a step toward her, but then hears }
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{is that wills keane?}
<A>__{he turns and sees dolores talbot, 70, blonde wig, spindly frame, weathered skin, large, sad eyes. she holds a mixed drink }
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{it sure as hell is and he hasn't changed a bit!}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i'm sorry, do i }
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{you little fool, it's dolores talbot. dolly!}
<A>__{his smile shows uneasy surprise }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{my god, it is.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{yeah, i know, time's kicked my ass but good. come on, romeo, let's bury the hatchet. give me a hug. careful of the cocktail.}
<A>__{as he hugs dolores, he can't help but look over at charlotte again.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{so what the hell're you doin' around here? last i heard you were out in earthquake country blowin' the family fortune.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{actually, i doubled it.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{good for you!}
<A>__{on charlotte. she looks over. her view is such that she sees wills but not dolores. a faint blush creeps into charlotte's cheeks. she pretends to listen as shannon tells a story }
<C>__{shannon}
<D>__{ and you know how bouncer's get. he's like, "that's the worst fake i.d. i've ever seen." and i'm like, "yeah? well, you have the worst dread extensions!" and then just when }
<A>__{noticing charlotte's distraction, simon whispers calmly to her }
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{are you feeling all right? you look positively green.}
<A>__{charlotte speaks under her breath without moving her lips }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{he's here. and he's staring at me again.}
<C>__{shannon}
<D>__{no way!}
<A>__{both shannon and simon turn to look, but like lightning charlotte grabs them both }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{don't!}
<P>__{(to simon)}
<D>__{wait a few seconds, then go to the bathroom.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{how will i know him?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{he's beautiful. and much older.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{really?}
<P>__{(getting up)}
<D>__{if he's rich you might have a fight on your hands.}
<A>__{charlotte watches furtively as simon rises from his chair and walks over. as he passes wills, he flashes him a seductive smile. wills is confused by it.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{okay, look.}
<A>__{shannon swivels her head and throws an aloof, vacant stare in wills' direction. then she looks back at charlotte, mouth agape }
<C>__{shannon}
<D>__{he's as old as my dad!}
<A>__{charlotte laughs. back on wills. he does his best to be attentive as dolores exhales a plume of smoke into his face }
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{sure, l.a.'s okay if you're a cactus or a lizard, but if you're a new englander, your soul dries up and blows away like a god damn leaf.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{it only took me twenty years to come to my senses.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{so what're you doin' now? you owned some restaurants out there, didn't you?}
<A>__{on charlotte. she sits listening to shannon }
<C>__{shannon}
<D>__{and so, after all that, we pay our cover, we get in, and it's totally heinous! nothing but losers and }
<A>__{charlotte looks over and pales, her eyes widening }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{oh, shit.}
<C>__{shannon}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{dolores walks up, hauling wills by the arm }
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{kids! i want you to meet an old chum of mine, the owner of this fine establishment wills keane!}
<A>__{the table greets him. wills, slightly self conscious, looks at everyone but charlotte.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{and that over there's the birthday girl my granddaughter, charlotte.}
<A>__{the news hits wills hard. but he does his best to hide it. he musters a casual smile }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{not katie and jay's daughter?}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{you bet. she got her height from her dad. but her talent's all katie's.}
<A>__{dolores indicates the hat that charlotte's wearing }
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{made it herself from scratch. that one, too.}
<P>__{(to shannon)}
<D>__{honey, show 'im.}
<A>__{shannon makes an elaborate comic show of modeling the hat she's wearing. the table laughs. wills levels his gaze at charlotte }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{impressive.}
<A>__{try as she might to accept the compliment with grace, charlotte can't help but grin.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{the wine steward stands at a station on which sit two bottles of champagne on ice. he reaches for one. wills stops him }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i think we can do better than that.}
<A>__{the steward, understanding, nods and departs, taking the champagne with him.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{happy birthday, charlotte.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{shannon}
<P>__{(under her breath)}
<D>__{twenty years old and never been...}
<C>__{charlotte}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{shut up!}
<A>__{amused, he flashes charlotte his most dazzling smile.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i will let you get back to your celebration.}
<P>__{(kissing dolly's cheek)}
<D>__{a pleasure to see you again.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{same here.}
<A>__{wills turns to exit. simon, returning to his seat, murmurs seductively to wills as he passes by }
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{leaving so soon?}
<A>__{wills looks at him, confused again, then continues on. as simon sits, he mutters to charlotte }
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{be still my beating heart.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{or is that your heart?}
<C>__{shannon}
<P>__{(whisper to charlotte)}
<D>__{you're not really into him, are you?}
<A>__{charlotte turns to dolores who has just sat down.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{hey, dolly, how do you know him?}
<C>__{dolly}
<P>__{(uneasily)}
<D>__{from newport. old friend of your mom's.}
