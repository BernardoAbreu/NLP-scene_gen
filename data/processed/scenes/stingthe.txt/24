<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior an old brownstone night}
<A>__{hooker, still in his suit, but looking a little worse for wear, knocks on the door of one of the apartments. a young black woman, louise, answers the door, holding a baby.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{howdy, louise.}
<C>__{louise}
<P>__{(admiring hooker in his suit)}
<D>__{goddamn, johnny hooker, you're a sharp hunky in them linens. if you wasn't so pale, i'da sworn you had class.}
<A>__{hooker steps inside and walks right into a big hug from an older black woman, alva. alva has a hat on, obviously just about to go out. beyond her we see the eirie kid and the black man (known from here on as luther coleman) playing a game of mah jong on the dining table with a man whose back is to us. an 11 year old boy is listening to the radio.}
<C>__{coleman}
<D>__{turn that down, leroy.}
<C>__{alva}
<D>__{oh, johnny, luther said you was somethin' to see today.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{i will never be as good as that mark, alva.}
<C>__{alva}
<D>__{well, we gonna hear all about it when we get back from church. leroy, get your jacket on, boy.}
<A>__{leroy goes to get his jacket. louise is finished putting the baby to bed.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{you goin' to church now?}
<C>__{alva}
<D>__{they been havin' late bingo down there. i'm gonna call on the lord for a little cash, while he's still payin' off. luther, you look in on that child from time to time, will ya?}
<A>__{luther nods that he will. alva, leroy and louise leave for church as hooker strolls over and tosses two packets on the table. luther doesn't pick his up, but the other man does. we now see that he is the thief in the opening sequence. he is called the eirie kid and he is delighted at his share.}
<C>__{eirie kid}
<D>__{hey, luther told me he was carrying a wad, but i didn't figure this much.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{which way did he do, eirie?}
<C>__{eirie kid}
<D>__{straight north. he was gonna take it all and run.}
<C>__{hooker}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{the bastard. he can blow his nose all the way.}
<A>__{they laugh again, but luther doesn't share their enthusiasm. he watches hooker who becomes uncomfortable under his gaze.}
<C>__{coleman}
<D>__{you're late. where you been?}
<C>__{hooker}
<P>__{(flopping into a chair)}
<D>__{i had some appointments.}
<C>__{coleman}
<P>__{(not fooled)}
<D>__{how much did ya lose?}
<C>__{hooker}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{all of it.}
<C>__{coleman}
<P>__{(pissed)}
<D>__{in one goddamn night? what are ya sprayin' money around like that for? you coulda been nailed.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{i checked the place out. there weren't no dicks in there.}
<C>__{coleman}
<D>__{you're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp. i didn't teach ya to be no pimp.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{what's eatin' you? i've blown money before.}
<C>__{coleman}
<D>__{no class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{you think my play is bad?}
<C>__{coleman}
<D>__{i think it's the best...}
<A>__{hooker sinks back, embarrassed that he misread coleman's intentions.}
<C>__{coleman}
<D>__{...it's the only reason i ain't quit before now.}
<C>__{hooker}
<P>__{(bewildered)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{coleman}
<D>__{i'm gettin' too slow for this racket. i done the best i'm gonna do. you hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{what are you talkin' about? we just took off the biggest score we've ever had. we can do anything we want now.}
<C>__{coleman}
<D>__{it's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the big con. you're wastin' your time workin' street marks.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{hey look. you think i'm gonna run out on ya or somethin'? just cause we hit it big. luther, i owe you everything. if you hadn't taught me con, i wouldn't know nothin'.}
<C>__{coleman}
<P>__{(a little embarrassed)}
<D>__{aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker. you know everything i know. you got nothin' more to learn from me.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{but you played the big con. you said it was nothin'. a game for flakes and mama's boys.}
<C>__{coleman}
<D>__{and i'm tellin' ya now, you're a fool if you don't get into it. a bigger fool than i was.}
<P>__{(pause, holding up the money)}
<D>__{i been lookin' for this one all my life, johnny. now i got a chance to step out at the top.}
<A>__{hooker knows it's no use.}
<C>__{hooker}
<P>__{(after a long silence)}
<D>__{what the hell you gonna do with yourself?}
<C>__{coleman}
<D>__{aw, i got a brother down in k.c., runs a freight outlet. i can go halfsies with 'em! it ain't too exciting, but it's mostly legal.}
<A>__{hooker just nods.}
<C>__{coleman}
<D>__{straighten up, kid. i wouldn't turn ya out if ya weren't ready.}
<P>__{(flipping hooker a piece of paper)}
<D>__{i got a guy named henry gondorff i want you to look up. there ain't a better insideman alive. he'll teach ya everything ya gotta know.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{you'll take a cut of what i make, won't ya?}
<C>__{coleman}
<D>__{i'm out, johnny.}
<C>__{hooker}
