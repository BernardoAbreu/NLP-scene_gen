<A>__{reagan runs on. they are in an enclosed storage yard of some kind. ten foot chainlink all around. utah struggles to get up and run. he sprawls forward, biting back a howl of pain. we see the incredible will driving him on. he gets up and again, hobbling. trying to run. reagan reaches the fence. he is heaving for breath. holding his side. utah stumbles, gets up, clutching his knee. hobbling forward. his eyes wild, the veins in his neck bulging. reagan starts to climb. utah collapses to his knees. he can't go on. reagan reaches the top of the fence. he looks back.}
