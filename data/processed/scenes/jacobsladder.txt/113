<L>__{exterior soho streets night}
<A>__{jacob rushes into the icy air and runs wildly down the sidewalk as fast as his legs will move. with unexpected violence he charges into the side of a building. over and over he hurls himself against it. he grabs for the bricks. his fingers insert themselves into the crevices. it is as though he is trying to merge with the wall. suddenly jacob turns and dashes into the street. a taxi is speeding toward him, its lights the only sign of life and warmth in the dark night. jacob steps into its path. it is hard to tell if he is trying to stop the cab or waiting to be hit. the taxi screeches to a halt. jacob stares at it a moment and then steps to get in. the driver tries to pull off but jacob yanks at the door and drags himself inside.}
