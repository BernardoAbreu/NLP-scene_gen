<L>__{interior small courtroom day}
<A>__{joe's preliminary trial. joe is seated at the defense table with elliot. another judge, judge harold pine, is behind the bench. no jury. this is a preliminary hearing to determine if there's enough evidence for joe to stand trail. elliot is shuffling papers in preparation for his opening. and at the prosecution table is a very tired helen. she looks completely pissed off and worn out. in no mood for anything to go wrong.}
<C>__{judge harold pine}
<D>__{whenever you're ready.}
<A>__{elliot stands.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{we would like to plead not guilty to the charge of murder at this time for reason of insanity.}
<A>__{helen gives elliot a look. she doesn't need this.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{but i did it.}
<A>__{elliot turns to joe.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{yes, joe. let me handle this.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{but i signed the confession.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{yes, joe. don't worry about it. i'm the attorney.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{your honor, can we have a moment?}
<C>__{judge harold pine}
<D>__{council may approach the bench.}
<A>__{helen and elliot cross to the bench.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{your honor, my colleague's client admits to the killing. i don't see any reason to go through a trial when it's obvious he would like to plead guilty.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{i don't agree.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{if he wants to plead guilty, you have to let him plead guilty.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{not if he's not of sound mind.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{come on, elliot!}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{i think he's crazy. i know you think he's just putting it on, that's d.a. standard procedure, but i don't think he is. so, your honor, i'm standing by the not guilty because i believe he's incapable of making that judgment.}
<C>__{judge harold pine}
<D>__{have you had a psychiatrist look at him?}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{yes, your honor.}
<P>__{(hands him papers)}
<D>__{i think you'll see that my diagnosis is not without warrant.}
<A>__{the judge hesitates, then looks at joe. joe is staring at him.}
<C>__{judge harold pine}
<D>__{i will review the findings and make my decision tomorrow.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{thank you, your honor.}
<P>__{(to helen)}
<D>__{besides, i hear there's a good chance of beating the charges for lack of evidence.}
<A>__{helen's look turns icy.}
