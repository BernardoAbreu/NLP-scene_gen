<A>__{ben's arms come into view and pull the mask down. we are now looking through the mask as we move forward down the hall. everything is slightly distorted through the glass. ben's hand comes up again with the breathing apparatus in it. sound: the rythmic pumping of air, obliterating the sound of the people around the pool who seem to be applauding and chattering noiselessly. we move out of the door and toward the pool. mr. braddock is running back and forth, clapping his hands and delivering his now soundless pitch. we move down the steps and into the shallow end of the pool. mr. braddock is moving along the side of the pool, motioning toward us to come down to the deep end. he joins mr. arnold at the far end of the pool. they both begin to motion us toward them. we get to the deep end of the pool. mr. braddock signals us with his hand to go under. he kneels down by the edge of the pool and reaches out with his hand and pushes us under. he has a big smile. we surface again and pan around for a last look. the figures, through the slightly distorted glass of the mask of mrs. arnold and mrs. braddock, watching and smiling; the neighbors on each side of the house, looking over their fences and laughing and pointing; mr. arnold nodding encouragement and talking; mr. braddock on his knees, smiling and trying to reach out far enough to push us under. we go under and sink to the bottom of the pool.}
