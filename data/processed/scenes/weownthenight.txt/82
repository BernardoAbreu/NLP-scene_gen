<L>__{interior tenement apartment front room}
<A>__{someone pulls the hood off him. bobby looks around. the room is absolutely bare. the driver puts bobby's bag of money down on the floor. a teenaged boy wearing a surgical mask comes and puts one on bobby's face as well. bobby surveys the place. where the hell is he? with that mask on his face, we hear his breathing, loud and present, through the sequence. it could be night or day, we wouldn't know. the windows are blocked with duct tape to obscure all light. there is visquine hanging from seemingly everywhere. parts of rooms are cordoned off with the material. silhouetted figures roam through the space like apparitions. a slavic looking man takes bobby's bag of money, leaves the room.}
<B>__{in the hallway}
<A>__{stands pavel, masked as well, armed now with a kalashnikov rifle. without a word, he motions with a move of his head to bobby. "follow me," he seems to be saying.}
