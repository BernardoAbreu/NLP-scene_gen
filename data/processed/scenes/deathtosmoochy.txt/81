<L>__{interior angelo's apartment night}
<A>__{randolph sits in front of the television in a daze. he's wearing a ratty bathrobe and absentmindedly tosses cheese curls onto the floor from a bag on his lap. on the tv, an "entertainment tonight" type show with two perky hosts is covering smoochy's return to the airwaves. the hosts, tara and hunter show smoochy's dynamic entrance and the standing ovation he got during the taping that day.}
<C>__{tara }
<D>__{well, smoochy's back and boy did we miss him. hundreds of well wishers stood outside kidnet studios today hoping to catch a glimpse of their favorite rhino.}
<C>__{hunter }
<D>__{that's right, tara. smoochy's popularity is stronger than ever thanks to his recent exoneration as a nazi sympathizer. in fact, several movie studios are offering big bucks for a chance to bring the smoochy story to the silver screen...}
<A>__{the broadcast continues. smoochy images flash across the screen. randolph has been mumbling the whole time.}
<C>__{randolph}
<P>__{(quietly to himself)}
<D>__{bad... very bad... too much for brain... pressure building... ears ringing... eyes burning... contempt overflowing...}
<A>__{he jumps up and kicks the tv over. he picks up a lamp and starts beating the tv.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{i hate you! i fucking hate you!!! you devil horned mind fucker! die, die, die!!}
<A>__{angelo, who was cooking in the kitchen, runs out. he's wearing an apron.}
<C>__{angelo}
<D>__{what are you doing?! that's a zenith!}
<P>__{(notices cheese curls)}
<D>__{look at this place!}
<A>__{he grabs the lamp from randolph.}
<C>__{angelo}
<D>__{that's it! i want you out of here!}
<C>__{randolph}
<P>__{(suddenly scared)}
<D>__{where am i supposed to go?}
<C>__{angelo}
