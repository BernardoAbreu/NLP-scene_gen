<B>__{new angle over mulder and scully}
<A>__{scully is still face down on the ice, as mulder watches the ship's shadow cast over mulder's snowcat which is still parked in the distance. moving up and off. the ship continues up into the antarctic sky where it rises toward the sky where it begins to get whitehot. transforming itself into pure energy. it is visible for several moments during transformation. then it disappears completely. as it does the rumble, which dopplers across the white, barren landscape. then it is gone.}
<B>__{mulder}
<A>__{watches this then lays his head down on scully's back. he is spent, at the brink of complete exhaustion. his whole body heaving. but now starting to shiver, and to lose consciousness. scully's body is motionless beneath him, for a moment we might believe that this is the way it might end. out here on the ice with mulder and scully freezing to death. a chill wind blows off the antarctic plain, the same low rumble, the only taint of silence in vastness of this literal end of the world. then scully coughs the same hoarse cough. she's alive. struggling to consciousness. her head lifting slightly, turning to camera. her eyes blink open and she coughs again. feeling mulder's weight on top of her, unaware of his condition or even where she is.}
<C>__{scully}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{mulder...}
<A>__{there is no answer. scully struggling to pull herself out from under the weight of his body. rolling over so that her face is opposite mulder's now. seeing that he has lost consciousness. finding the strength to roll him over, so that she can cradle him and warm him.}
<B>__{high wide angle on this scene}
<A>__{with the snowcat a short distance away, mulder and scully in each others arms. the way it should end.}
