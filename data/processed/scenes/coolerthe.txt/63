<A>__{bernie enters. flips on the light. no natalie.}
<C>__{bernie}
<P>__{(calls to the bathroom)}
<D>__{natalie? you in there?}
<A>__{no answer. he heads over. finds it empty. concern spreads across his features. he glances around the room. notices the closet wide open. natalie's clothes missing.}
<C>__{bernie}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{natalie.}
<A>__{that's when he catches sight of the note taped to the dresser mirror. he rushes over, rips it off. i'm sorry bernie. i guess it just wasn't in the cards for us. take care, natalie. bernie slumps to the floor in disbelief. starts to tremble. then rocks back and forth, wracked by stifled sobs. christ, make it stop hurting...}
