<T>__{cut to jacob :}
<A>__{stepping cautiously onto the ladder going down to the tracks. a rat scampers by and he gasps.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no way!}
<A>__{he starts to climb back up the ladder but sees that there is nowhere else to go. he juts out his jaw and steps back down. jacob is not comfortable on the tracks. he cannot see where he is stepping. his shoes slpash in unseen liquid which makes him grimace. the steel girders are coated in subway grime. the oily substance coats his hands as he reaches for support.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{goddam fucking city!}
<A>__{he wipes the grime on his postal uniform as he steps toward the center track. he reaches for another girder when it begins to vibrate. two pinpoints of light hurl toward him. then the noise arrives confirming his fear. a train is bearing down on him. jacob looks frightened, not sure which way to go. he steps forward, up to his ankle in slime. he cannot tell which track the train is on. it is moving at phenomenal speed. the station is spinning. the train's lights merge into one brilliant intensity. in near panic jacob jumps across the track as the train spins by. its velocity blows his hair straight up as though it is standing on end. he clings to a pillar for support, gasping in short breaths. a few people are staring at jacob from the train. their faces, pressed up against the glass, seem deformed. a lone figure waves at him from the rear window. the train bears them all away. then it is quiet again. for a moment jacob is afraid to move but slowly regains his composure. he continues to the other side of the tracks and stumbles up the ladder to the uptown platform.}
