<L>__{interior rand's hospital room night}
<A>__{rand is in bed. eve sits on the edge, looks warmly to chance who stands nearby. allenby prepares an injection for rand, and occasionally glances curiously at chance. chance breathes deeply, enjoys the oxygen.}
<C>__{rand}
<P>__{(with some effort)}
<D>__{... you possess a great gift, chauncey, of being natural. and that, my boy, is a rare talent, the true mark of a leader. you were strong and brave, yet did not moralize. i hope the entire country was watching you tonight, the entire country...}
<A>__{allenby crosses to rand, needle in hand.}
<C>__{allenby}
<D>__{and you, benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. turn over, please.}
<C>__{rand}
<P>__{(holds up hand)}
<D>__{in a minute, robert in a minute... chauncey, i would like to ask a favor of you...}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{certainly, ben.}
<C>__{rand}
<D>__{senator rowley's widow, sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring ambassador skrapinov of the soviet union... i think it's rather obvious that robert won't allow me to attend, so would you go in my place, and escort eve?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes. i would like to escort eve.}
<C>__{rand}
<D>__{good. together, the two of you should create quite a stir i can already hear the gossip.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(with a blush)}
<D>__{... ben, really...}
<C>__{rand}
<P>__{(reaches out a tired hand}
<D>__{to chance chance holds}
<P>__{it)}
<D>__{... thank you, chauncey... thank you very much.}
<P>__{(takes back hand)}
<D>__{... all right, robert, i'm all yours.}
<A>__{eve and chance quietly leave the room. allenby watches chance go, then readies rand for the injection.}
