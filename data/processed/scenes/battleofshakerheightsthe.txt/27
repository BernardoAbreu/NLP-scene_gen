<L>__{interior art supply store day}
<A>__{kelly looks through the paints, picking out tubes. he looks up and sees tabby browsing the paintbrushes. he's suddenly nervous. he knocks over a few cans of thinner. almost leaves. instead, he gathers his courage, goes to the display opposite hers and waits to catch her eye.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{they're having a sale on glitter.}
<A>__{it takes tabby a second to recognize him.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{oh, hello. what happened to you?}
<C>__{kelly}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{tennis injury.}
<A>__{tabby looks at him suspiciously like she's not sure whether to believe him. tabby finishes with the mediums and moves onto the paints. kelly follows her, staying in the opposite aisle.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{you paint?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{well, you see... that's a difficult question.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{how so?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i don't really feel comfortable calling anything done since the renaissance "painting." we might have a more experimental interaction with the picture plane, but our skills have suffered from it.}
<A>__{in spite of herself, tabby laughs at this. this gives kelly more confidence. he leans over the aisle to see what she's looking at.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{you're working with acrylic. why? oil's much richer.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{oh you're not one of those oil snobs are you?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{of course not.}
<A>__{kelly comes around and leans nonchalantly against the shelves, knocks more things over and fumbles to replace them.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{it's just isn't acrylic a bit jejune?}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{jejune? you're jejune. how old are you anyway?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{older than my years.}
<A>__{tabby walks to the counter with her brushes.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{and you paint?}
<A>__{kelly looks down and partially confesses.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{well, you know, my mother's kind of an artist, so }
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{that explains it.}
<A>__{tabby signs the slip and takes the bag. she walks out, kelly with her, matches her pace, talking.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{that explains nothing. doesn't anyone believe in innate knowledge anymore? michelangelo was fifteen when he painted the infanta.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{infantas are spanish. michelangelo was italian.}
<A>__{tabby gets into her car. kelly leans into her window.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{exactly. one world, one people. just like jesse jackson envisioned.}
<A>__{tabby tries to conceal her smile and starts her car.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{well kelly. nice talking to you.}
<A>__{she drives away. kelly stands there watching. then he winces.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{what the hell did you just say?}
