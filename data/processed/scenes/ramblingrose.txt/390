<L>__{interior hillyer home kitchen day}
<A>__{a shot of daddy sitting with mother at the kitchen table. bright cheerful sunshine comes in the window that opens on the patio. rose comes into the shot carrying a coffee pot, a sunny smile on her face.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{you're looking very chipper this morning, rose. sow do you feel?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{perfect, wonderful, good as i ever felt! except for a big old scar on my stummick, i wouldn't even know i been in the hospital.}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(with mild irony, as she pours him coffee)}
<D>__{well, we know you were there. the bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous.}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(her smile fades a trifle)}
<D>__{well, i will pay you that back sometime, mr. hillyer.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{don't worry about it, honey.}
<A>__{daddy pauses, seems to be struggling with himself, he is frowning.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{rose... i hate to be mean, but...}
<P>__{(another pause, then a little shrug)}
<D>__{oh, nevermind, forget it.}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(in a little sad voice)}
<D>__{what was it, mr. hillyer?}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(rises)}
<D>__{nothing, rose.}
<A>__{daddy stops beside her, puts an arm around her shoulders and with weary irony.}
<C>__{daddy }
<D>__{we all love you, darlin'.}
<A>__{daddy wearily picks up his straw hat from the kitchen counter and walks out of the kitchen on the patio, as the camera stays on rose and mother.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{don't worry, honey, you'll find something.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{i was offered that job as a waitress.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{forget about it, i don't want you working in one of those honky tonks.}
