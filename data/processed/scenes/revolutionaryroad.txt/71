<L>__{interior wheeler family room day.}
<A>__{on a television. elmer fudd points a gun at bugs bunny, and pulls the trigger. frank frowns into his french phrase book. mike is watching the tv. april works a sewing machine with a cigarette burning beside her. jennifer stands beside her holding a stuffed giraffe and a list, which she reads.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i'm going to take my doll carriage and my bear and my three easter rabbits and my giraffe and all my dolls and my doll house.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{i thought maybe we'd give the doll house to madeline.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{no! i don't want to give it to madeline.}
<A>__{april has to stop to re thread and she's losing patience.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{i already explained to you, the big things are going to be hard to pack.}
<A>__{frank lowers the book. he recognizes her tone.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{but madeline can have my bear and my easter rabbits }
<C>__{april}
<D>__{no! just the big things. look. wouldn't you rather go outside and play with michael.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i don't feel like it.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{you've been inside all day.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i don't feel like it!}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{well, i don't feel like explaining everything fifteen times to somebody who's too bored and silly to listen!}
<A>__{jennifer turns and runs up the stairs, upset. april lets out a defeated sigh. she turns to the kitchen to see to the supper. steam rises from the vegetables. frank stands in the entrance silently watching for a moment.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{she carries a pot of steaming, overcooked vegetables to the sink, slops them into a colander.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i don't believe you. did something happen today or what?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{nothing happened today that i haven't known about for days and days.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{oh god, frank, please don't look so dense. do you mean you haven't guessed or anything?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<A>__{she finally stops and looks at him.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{i'm pregnant, that's all.}
<A>__{beat as he absorbs it. he's totally blind sided.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what...? jesus.}
<A>__{she comes over to him.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{oh, frank, i meant to wait until dinner to tell you, but i just well, i've been pretty sure all week and today i went to the doctor and now i can't even pretend it's not true.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(still stunned)}
<D>__{jesus... how long?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{ten weeks.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you didn't say anything.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{i thought... oh, i don't know what i thought.}
<A>__{he stares, still unsure how he feels.}
<C>__{april }
<D>__{i'm sorry, frank. i'm so sorry.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i know you are.}
<A>__{she looks at him, with slight desperation.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{we don't have to let this stop us. there are things we can do. remember that girl at school i told you about...? as long as you do it before 12 weeks, it's fine.}
<A>__{he just looks at her and his silence makes her desperate.}
<C>__{april }
<D>__{we've got to be together in this, frank. otherwise nothing's going to make any sense.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{okay. we'll figure it out.}
<A>__{he takes her in his arms.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{12 weeks. so we have time.}
<A>__{on frank's face... slowly, he smiles.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{i love you frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{...i love you too.}
