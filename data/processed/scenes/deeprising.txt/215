<A>__{side by side, hanover and pantucci quickly slog their way through waist high water. they round a corner and look back inky forms slosh around the corner. heading right for them. they slog faster.}
<C>__{pantucci}
<D>__{they're catchin' up! they're catchin' up! we gotta slow 'em down!}
<C>__{hanover}
<D>__{feed them. that'll slow them down.}
<A>__{a black striated muscle roils out of the foamy water, then quickly vanishes under it, heading straight for them.}
<C>__{pantucci}
<D>__{feed 'em?!! okay! all right! feed 'em what? what are we gonna feed}
<A>__{'em?! hanover takes his pistol and shoots pantucci in the leg, blam! pantucci screams. falls into the water. hanover runs on. pantucci doesn't even have time to deal with the pain. he starts scrambling through the water. underwater, the inky forms race after him. only meters away. pantucci throws himself into the opening of a dumbwaiter. slams the door shut. the tentacle attacks the door. worming its way across the surface, trying to find a way inside. pantucci is scared beyond his pain. pushing back as far as he can against the rear wall, he sees the control button. he presses the up arrow. the dumbwaiter starts to move.}
