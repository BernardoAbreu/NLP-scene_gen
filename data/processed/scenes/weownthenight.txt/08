<A>__{wood panelled walls. bobby walks upstairs, fixing his hair.}
<L>__{interior marat buzhayev's apartment foyer living room}
<A>__{an ornate, gaudy place. the walls are covered by mirrors with that cheesy brown marble pattern print all over them. plush couches, clutter. bobby walks in. we hear radio music up here, nothing like the stuff played downstairs. a russian crooner. in an easy chair sits marat buzhayev (pronounced boo shy' ev). he is old, kindly, weakened by age; sits next to his babushka wife, kalina. buzhayev watches a russian musical program with the sound off, listening to his small transistor radio.}
<C>__{marat buzhayev}
<D>__{bobby! come here!}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{mr. buzhayev, how are you!}
<A>__{bobby leans over, hugs the seated old man. the two embrace warmly they are close. before separating, buzhayev touches his face. kalina yells happily in russian, grabs bobby, embraces him too. she couldn't be more motherly, amd bobby beams at the treatment.}
<C>__{kalina buzhayev }
<D>__{so beautiful! beautiful!}
<A>__{bobby is moved, almost embarrassed by the loving attention. then, gently dropping a set of keys on a side table:}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{listen, mr. buzhayev i gotta go do something right now. but don't worry everything's in good shape downstairs.}
<C>__{marat buzhayev}
<P>__{(warm, gentle)}
<D>__{yes, good. you take care of things good for us...}
<A>__{marat smiles. then, as bobby stands:}
<C>__{marat buzhayev }
<D>__{next week, you come by we talk. okay? we talk about plans for you.}
<A>__{bobby lights up, nods. marat pats his cheek. kalina tries to give him a small care package of food. he politely refuses, and a minor and friendly ad libbed argument in russian ("he said he didn't want any food, and you keep trying to give it to him!") breaks out between the old husband and his wife. as bobby exits:}
<C>__{kalina buzhayev}
<P>__{(broken english)}
<D>__{bobby! where you run off to?!?}
