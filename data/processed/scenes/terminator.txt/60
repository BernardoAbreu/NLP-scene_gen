<L>__{31 phone booth}
<A>__{a woman's voice, a faint reedy monologue, issues from the dangling receiver. terminator leafs rapidly through the directory. angle c.u. pages flipping angle macro shot, as terminator's finger comes to rest beside a now familiar listing: connor, sarah}

<L>__{interior big bob's dining area}
<A>__{sarah is bustling about, trying to service the start of the dinner rush. in waitress parlance, she's 'in it'. she runs the gauntlet between tables, precariously balancing two full dinner plates on one arm and hand carrying a third. a customer tugs on her apron for attention and she barely averts contributing the chili size to his wardrobe.}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{honey, can i get that coffee now?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{yes sir, just a second.}
<A>__{she reaches her table after near collisions with a mexican busboy and two teenage girls doing cheerleading routines in lock step.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{who gets the burly burger?}
<C>__{customer two}
<D>__{i ordered barbecue beef.}
<C>__{customer three}
<D>__{does mine come with fires?}
<C>__{customer four}
<D>__{he's got the barbecue beef, i've got a chili beef deluxe.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{okay, who gets the burly beef?}
<C>__{customer at next table}
<D>__{miss, we're ready to order.}
<A>__{in the process of setting down all the plates sarah knocks over someone's water glass.}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(mopping fran tically)}
<D>__{oh, sorry. that's not real leather, is it?}
<A>__{as she cleans up the spill, a kid at the next booth reaches over and dumps a scoop of ice cream into the top pouch of sarah's apron she stares down at the mess melting over her hard earned and sags with defeat. nancy, a plump, gum chewing waitress, stops beside her to whisper.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{look at it this way: in a hundred years, who's gonna care?}
