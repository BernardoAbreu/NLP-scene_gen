<A>__{sulking, alicia sits in back with he walkman on. troy sleeps while miguel drives. suddenly miguel his the brakes, as something comes sailing down from the sky. we realize it's the b wing plane landing on the stretch of roadway directly in front of them.}
<L>__{exterior roadway continuous}
<A>__{the plane lands, skids into a turn. russell jumps out, walks over to the trailer. we can tell he's drunk again.}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{they let you out?}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{just what the hell do you think you're doing?}
<A>__{miguel moves to meet russell away from the trailer, not wanting the others to hear.}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{we're leaving, don't try and stop us.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{you're not going anywhere. you hear me? i'm still your father.}
<A>__{miguel explodes, this has been building up for some time.}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{no, you're not! you're just the man who married my mother. you're nothing to me!}
<A>__{russell is momentarily silent, stunned. recovering...}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{for once in your life think about what's best for troy. who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? who?}

<C>__{troy}
<D>__{stop it! i'm not a baby! i don't need your stupid medicine. i don't need anyone to take care of me!}
<A>__{miguel leans down to see the broken medicine bottle on the floor. miguel rushes over to him, furious.}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{you know what this stuff costs? do you want to get sick again!? do you!?}
<A>__{frustrated, miguel shoves troy aside and heads back into the trailer. wobbly from the drinking, russell stands there pathetically, watching.}
