<A>__{we see benjamin with an elderly woman, ms. sanderson, standing at the railing of a mezzanine above the factory work floor... looking down upon the workers, exclusively women, and exclusively white women, making buttons...the women, seeing him, look up, and there's a sudden hush...}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{my name is benjamin, benjamin...}
<P>__{(for the first time)}
<D>__{button...}
<A>__{they stare up at him...}
<C>__{benjamin }
<D>__{as you know, my father...}
<A>__{it still sounds strange to him.}
<C>__{benjamin }
<D>__{...my father, thomas button... recently passed...}
<A>__{after a moment:}
<C>__{benjamin }
<D>__{he asked that i take over the day to day operation of button's buttons.}
<A>__{they silently stare up at him....}
<C>__{benjamin }
<D>__{well, i don't know the first thing about buttons...and i don't know a thing about business...}
<C>__{benjamin }
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{button's buttons has been in my father's family for over 100 years. it could not have survived without people like you. my father asked me to tell you how much he appreciated the hard work you put in for him and his company for so many years.}
<A>__{dead still... and after a moment;}
<C>__{benjamin }
<D>__{i have decided that all of you his loyal employees, will have a share, depending on your length of employment, in the ownership of this factory, his legacy.}
<C>__{one of the women}
<D>__{we're the owners now?}
<C>__{benjamin}
<D>__{that's about it.}
<A>__{they're literally dumbfounded.}
<C>__{benjamin }
<D>__{mrs. sanderson will explain how everything works and will answer any of your questions...}
<A>__{and with that he turns, walking away...having "given away the store"... the workers in disbelief looking up at him...}
