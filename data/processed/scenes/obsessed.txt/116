<A>__{beth moves through the room, stopping to pick up one of kyle's toys. she looks through the sliding glass window and sees derek on the deck, holding kyle in his arms. they're playing a game. derek points to objects in the distance and kyle identifies them. "truck... doggie... bird..." and so on. a tear in beth's eye. she comes closer. they don't see her.}
