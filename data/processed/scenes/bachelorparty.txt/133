<L>__{interior movie theater}
<A>__{the patrons are wearing their 3d glasses, watching the action on the screen. on the movie screen we see a man and a woman arguing. cole and debbie enter the theater. they run down to the front of the screen, heading for an exit. rick enters. he gives chase and catches up with cole. he takes a swing at cole and cole swings back. behind them on the screen a man has come to the rescue of the woman. a fight starts in the movie, also. the patrons sit calmly watching the action. miraculously, rick's fight with cole is in perfect sync with the actors in the movie. rick hits cole with a punch that sends him backwards into several movie patrons. the patrons are impressed by the realism of the film's special effects. cole throws a punch. rick ducks. the punch hits a man in the front row in the mouth.}
