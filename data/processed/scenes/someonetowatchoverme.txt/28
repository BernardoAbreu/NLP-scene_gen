<A>__{mike and t.j. disheveled and tired, drinking out of styrofoam coffee cups, arriving at the club.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{hey mike, out of the bag into the bureau, huh... how do you like it so far?}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(giving a half smile)}
<D>__{right behind you, t.j.}

<L>__{interior the club night}
<A>__{a rare tableau; swirling disco lights reflecting off strategically placed mirrors, illuminating a room filled with policemen (in uniforms and polyester suits), trying to ride herd on the beautiful people, in contrasting attire. the man in charge and coping is lieutenant garber; in plainclothes, fiftyish, rough hewn.}
<C>__{garber}
<D>__{did you ever hear the chatter. they're worse than fuckin' four year olds... miller, let's clear this path here, all right?}
<A>__{t.j. and mike arrive.}
<C>__{garber}
<P>__{(to them, on the move)}
<D>__{blood bath downstairs. the owner of this place is dead. and i got a witness, and a suspect... joey venza.}
<A>__{t.j. reacts to the name.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{where's venza?}
<C>__{garber}
<D>__{nice question. i like questions like that.}
<A>__{a massive "gasp" goes up from the crowd as a cumbersome bodybag is brought up a stairwell from downstairs. garber temporarily moves away to oversee.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(to t.j.)}
<D>__{who's joey venza?}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{bad fuckin' news. even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands. but he knows where a lot of bodies are buried. it'd cap it for garber if he could bring him in.}
<C>__{garber}
<P>__{(returning, re: the crowd)}
<D>__{okay, let's find out what we know. herd'm up and check'm out. anybody know more than gossip about the deceased or venza, i wanna talk to them myself. go.}
<A>__{t.j. moves into action with typical "t.j. style" diplomacy.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{okay, will all the beautiful people shut the fuck up, before it starts gettin' real ugly here!}
<A>__{the uniformed cops take their cue, moving in for quiet.}
<C>__{garber}
<P>__{(to mike, the "new boy")}
<D>__{keegan, go baby sit the witness. just sit and look impressive. make her feel protected. and if you can get her boyfriend outa my hair, i will promote you to fuckin' joint chiefs...}
