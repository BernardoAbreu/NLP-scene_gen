<L>__{interior lemongrass grill night}
<A>__{a hole in the wall lower east side thai restaurant. tyler and ally sit together perusing menus. a waiter approaches.}
<C>__{ally}
<P>__{(to the waiter)}
<D>__{what desserts do you have?}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{dessert special fried bananas a la mode.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{great, i will have that. a glass of skim milk. then the mussels, please.}
<A>__{tyler and the waiter share a look.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{pad thai and a sapporo. thanks.}
<A>__{the waiter takes the menus.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{i have my dessert first.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{is this a political statement? a medical condition?}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{i just don't see the point in waiting for something i know i want and am going to have. what if i die eating my mussels?}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{is that probable?}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{it's possible. if an embolism burst or an asteroid hit the restaurant, i'd die without having eaten the thing i wanted most.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{but the odds are, i mean...}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{fine. i will tell you what, you guarantee me. swear to me on your eternal soul that i will make it through my entree. and i will wait.}
<A>__{tyler goes to answer. ally holds up a hand.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{before you answer, keep in mind, if i die, you'll have to live the rest of your life knowing that you not only lied to me, but denied me my last indulgence. my last wish. are you prepared to shoulder that kind of responsibility to prove a point?}
<A>__{tyler thinks about it. smiles.}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{don't worry. i will share.}
