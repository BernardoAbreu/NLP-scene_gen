<A>__{...quoyle blinking awake on the deck of a pitching ferry. fog and cliff and the raw atlantic. and soaring alongside, an amazing number of maritime birds...the gulls and terns seeming to stare quoyle in the eye as they glide past. maybe they prompted his dream.}

<D>__{they draft off our air currents, it's quite premeditated.}
<A>__{she stands at the rail. smoking, despite the wind.}
<C>__{agnis}
<D>__{they actually know the ferry schedule. show up on time better'n the newfies.}
<A>__{he smiles a seasick smile. lurches from his bolted down chair to join her. she nods back toward... ...bunny through the glass window, snuggled with warren, feeding the dog french fries.}

<D>__{...image of m'sister, feeny. she's married to a falconer in arabia, now. has to wear a black thing over her face.}
<C>__{quoyle}

<A>__{she stares in his eyes. yes, like the falcon. they are growing on each other in a companionable way.}
<C>__{agnis}
<D>__{nice. to be with family.}

<C>__{agnis}
<D>__{'specially big shots. who can land a job with one phone call.}

<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{well, that was my friend partridge. made the call. and it's just an interview.}
<A>__{when quoyle looks back in at bunny, he sees she is staring off at something with full attention. he follows her gaze to... ...a honey haired mother with her small boy snuggled in her lap. she is feeding him an ice cream bar with evident tenderness. and though the child's face is blissfully vacant, she murmurs to him with serious intent.}
