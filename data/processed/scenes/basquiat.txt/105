<T>__{dissolve to:}
<B>__{the sea}
<A>__{it is flat, dead, gray. ominous and waiting.}
<L>__{interior great jones st. loft day}
<A>__{washed in sunlight, a large painting leans against the wall, the words "haitian baseball factories" scrawled through its center. jean lays down, watching tv. he looks older now, more worn. his face is slightly swollen. his complexion is discolored. shenge covers a triptych with wide brush strokes of yellow painterior he circles a large, primitive figure of a black man drawn with magic marker in the center. he is careful to leave the figure intact.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{paint it out.}
<C>__{shenge}
<D>__{out?}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{yeah... maybe just his arms.}
<P>__{(shenge paints out the arms)}
<D>__{put some cerulean blue there.}
<A>__{jean points to the lower corner. shenge picks up the phone, which has been ringing for some time.}
<C>__{shenge}
<D>__{it's andy again.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{still not here.}
<C>__{shenge}
<D>__{ in this corner?}
<C>__{basquiat}
<P>__{(not looking)}
<D>__{yeah..}
<A>__{shenge changes the brush and dips it in the can.}
<C>__{shenge}
<D>__{you want me to put it here?}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{use your fucking instinct.}
<A>__{shenge shrugs and starts to spread the blue. jean looks at his work.}
<C>__{basquiat }
<D>__{don't try to make art. just paint like a housepainter.}
<A>__{a woman's shout can be heard through the open window. shenge looks out.}
<C>__{shenge}
<D>__{it's maria portos. what should we do?}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{why don't you try letting her in, steve i mean shenge.}
<C>__{shenge}
<D>__{get up. she won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{wanna bet? if you show too much respect for people with money, they don't have respect for you.}
<A>__{maria, a raven haired, sharp featured beauty in a chanel suit jacket, blue jeans, and pearls walks into the room. she's with ellen younger a millionaire fake hippie from texas. maria carries a bag with clogs in it a present for jean. she takes them out.}
<C>__{maria}
<P>__{(showing him the clogs)}
<D>__{these reminded me of you, the clogs. i found them in amsterdam.}
<A>__{jean doesn't get up from the floor.}
<C>__{maria }
<D>__{how are you?}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{fine.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{you remember ellen?}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{what are you working on?}
<A>__{basquiat points at the painting.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{how much is something like that?}
<A>__{jean raises his hand and pumps five fingers three times in the air.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{fifteen. reasonable.}
<A>__{ellen makes a snotty face.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{it's unfinished.}
<P>__{(to shenge)}
<D>__{how 'bout some blue in the corner?}
<A>__{shenge gives jean a stupefied look.}
<C>__{shenge}
<D>__{blue? where?}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{what's wrong with you today?}
<A>__{shenge is embarrassed by jean's remark in the company of the two women.}
<C>__{basquiat }
<D>__{don't look at me like that. it hurts my feelings.}
<A>__{he points. unsure, shenge picks up the brush and paints one of the corners. maria browses through a stack of paintings leaning against the wall.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{i love these.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{god... i just can't even care anymore. compare this to a mountain or a tree. who're y'all trying to kid? that's what i think. i was just in the himalayas, and like ok is this important? no. i mean, compared to the rain forest or something? these are just narcissistic jokes.}
<C>__{maria}
<P>__{(to jean)}
<D>__{who are you selling these through now?}
<A>__{jean gets to his feet. he dips a long, thin brush into black paint and nonchalantly crosses out the half figure that shenge is carefully surrounding with blue.}
<C>__{basquiat}
<D>__{well, that's better.}
<P>__{(to maria)}
<D>__{you can buy direct from me.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{look at these silkscreens? what're you? andy warhol junior? it's like not even handmade anymore.}
<A>__{she's not even worth a response. jean looks around, numb.}
