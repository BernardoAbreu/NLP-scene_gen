<L>__{interior trans siberian restaurant night}
<D>__{nikolai is alone, sitting at a candlelit table, reading tatiana's diary. we hear tatiana in voice over...}
<C>__{tatiana }
<D>__{i am not sure i can carry on another day. the windows won't open so i can't throw myself out. they inject me every day with heroin. tatiana (v.o.) (cont'd) sometimes i think this is all a hallucination... he sees semyon approaching from the kitchen and closes the diary. semyon grabs a bottle of vodka from the bar on his way to sit opposite nikolai. nikolai pushes the diary across the table. semyon pours two drinks.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{it is good to have someone who i can trust to do simple tasks. a pause as semyon glances at a few pages of diary.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{in this business, sometimes the biggest danger comes from the most stupid things. you can't afford to be careless in any area. nikolai senses a change of attitude towards him. as if semyon were beginning to accept him into the fold. semyon raises a toast.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{nasdrovia.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{nasdrovia. after a moment.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{so what was the lie that soyka was spreading about my son? nikolai looks anxious.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{it was nothing important.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{kirill had him killed for nothing important? semyon pours two more vodkas.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{i don't want to repeat it.}
<C>__{semyon}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{for me you will repeat it. nikolai doesn't respond. it is obvious that semyon half knows already. he shrugs...}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{you play with the prince to do business with the king. but if you want to do business with me you must be open with me. thieves in law. a pause. semyon nurses his vodka.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{what was soyka saying about the prince? he stares into nikolai's eyes. finally, nikolai stammers...}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{that he is a drunk. and that he is also... a queer. semyon swigs his vodka and nikolai swigs his. semyon pours two more. semyon has to stare out of the window to hide his emotion.}
<C>__{semyon}
<P>__{(softly, in russian)}
<D>__{my only son. they both knock their drinks back. semyon looks suddenly angry as he peers out of the window.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{you know it never snows in this city. and it's never hot. london is a city of whores and queers. my son... semyon shrugs, fighting deeper emotion...}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{...i think london is to blame for what he is...}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{so why don't you go home? semyon smiles, as if seeing moscow through the window.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{the cold gets into my bones. a pause.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{and also... the kgb would be waiting for me. nikolai smiles ruefully and glances at semyon.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{fsb. they are called fsb now.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{whatever they call them they are worse even than the kgb were. maybe the kgb and the vory v zakone were partners in a marriage. we had rules, they had rules. he swigs some more vodka.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{now in moscow, the thieves don't wear tattoos and the police don't wear uniforms. you never know who they are... semyon seems to be taking the vodka less well than nikolai. he pours some more.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{you've heard about these new policemen? nikolai doesn't blink.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{they get under you, over you, behind you, inside you. they are the ones you least expect. semyon peers at nikolai and nikolai doesn't respond. mention of the new breed of fsb agent causes an almost imperceptible tension in nikolai. is semyon too drunk to notice? there is a strange game going on here. for now, nothing is revealed. semyon knocks back his vodka and nikolai does the same. semyon picks up the diary and holds it into the flame of the candle. it begins to burn and he drops it into the ashtray. the flames flicker for a while.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{the midwife said she had an uncle. a russian.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{i met him.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{so you know what he looks like. semyon peers at nikolai.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{she said he has read the diary. a pause.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{we can't trust a russian with that kind of information. a pause.}
<C>__{semyon }
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{do you understand me? semyon gets to his feet and smiles.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{perhaps you can deal with him. semyon leaves nikolai to stare into the flames of the burning diary.}
