<D>__{check this out. the feds think your missing girl might be related to three murders in austin. all redheads.}
<A>__{kale processes that as we suddenly hear a car door slam o.s. binocular pov kale tilts down to see ashley's mom backing out the driveway. kale tilts up to ashley's window ashley ducks back inside her room, disappears.}

<D>__{movement.}
<A>__{binocular pov kale tilts down to the pool, sees ashley emerging from the house with a towel that she throws on the lounge chair.}

<D>__{better late than never.}
<A>__{ronnie joins kale at the window. their pov ashley flips her sandals off one at a time, pulls her tank off revealing her bronzed back and bikini top.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{dude...}
<A>__{ashley slinks out of her shorts revealing a "near thong" bikini this time.}
<C>__{ronnie }
<D>__{dude!!}

<A>__{ashley crouches down, runs her fingers through the water.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{oh, it's so warm, baby...}
<A>__{ashley cups her hands, scoops a handful of water from the pool, splashes her face... runs her hands through her hair... she stands, takes a deep breath, holds it then exhales...}
<C>__{ronnie }
<D>__{cleansing breath...}
<A>__{ashley stretches her arms high above her head.}
<C>__{ronnie }
<D>__{concentrate now. this is for the gold.}
<A>__{ronnie grabs the binoculars from kale, puts them to his eyes, moves closer to the window but his zoomed in vision causes him to underestimate the distance thwump. the end of the binoculars hit the window just as ashley dives into the pool ronnie and kale hit the deck as we hear the splash o.s.}
<C>__{kale}
<D>__{jackass!}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{dude, there's no way she heard that.}
<C>__{kale}

<C>__{ronnie}
<P>__{(peering out)}
<D>__{she's got great lung capacity.}
<A>__{on ashley she suddenly surfaces, hoists herself from the water. she spins and sits on the ledge, rings the water from her hair. but she suddenly stops and shifts her gaze up toward kale and ronnie!}
