<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{full shot columbia inn floor (day) the scene is a melee of the excitement accompanying preparations for the show. the little stage has been enlarged the draperies pulled back right and left and a side wall pushed back a little farther. there is hammering and painting going on in various parts of the room. trunks have been unpacked and wardrobe hung up in odd places, as more trunks arrive. girls in abbreviated rehearsal clothes walk around, do cartwheels; two people sing at the piano; six girls kick in unison; altogether, it is quite a contrast to the bareness of the previous scene. the camera trucks through all the activity, taking in our group at the doorway, which features bob and phil, the girls standing nearby. martha and susan are amazed at the activity.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{i can't believe it! you mean you brought the whole show up here?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{when you hired the stewart sisters you also hired a new york show. it was in the small printerior}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{and you can't get out of it. we've got lawyers.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i can't thank you enough, but i wonder if gramp'll let you do it?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{his pride. when he decides he's going into bankruptcy he likes to go.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{now just a second. we're not doing this for him!}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{oh no! we're bringing the show down here to rehearse!}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{the company's been getting a little ragged. we'd appreciate the use of the hall.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{of course we don't expect it free!}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{we'll pay a little, but not much. you see, the audience will be guinea pigs and for us, that's quite an improvement.}
<A>__{this has not fooled susan. she throws her arms around bob and then phil.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i don't know what to say!}
<A>__{she cannot refrain from tears of gratitude and turns and runs out. there is a moment of silence.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i hope this is not an indication of advancing age, getting kissed out of gratitude.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{you didn't expect a girl that pretty to kiss you because she wanted to?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{a body keeps hoping.}
<A>__{betty steps up to him and gives him the biggest smack. bob is quite surprised.}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(sincerely)}
<D>__{that was the nicest thing i ever saw anybody do.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{it was still gratitude.}
<C>__{phil}
<P>__{(to judy)}
<D>__{i'm his partner. i'm entitled to half the credit.}
<P>__{(judy steps up to him}
<D>__{and just pecks him on the cheek, then joins her sister in}
<P>__{rehearsal)}
<D>__{she's not as grateful as her sister.}
<A>__{they look off through the exit and see a moving van unloading scenery, as the general arrives in his buggy. he steps down and looks with amazement at the scenery passing by.}
