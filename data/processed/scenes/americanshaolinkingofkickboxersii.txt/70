<L>__{interior dorm area same night}
<B>__{establishing shot of door to the sleeping quarters.}
<A>__{suddenly, it bursts open and in come the disciples, led by drew. they fan out into the room, drew in the center.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{gentlemen, this calls for a party!}
<A>__{he runs to his backpack and pulls out a boom box with speakers, and puts on some good old american rock 'n' roll. everyone, but gao, is moving in time with the music. drew is the most accomplished dancer, but the others are pretty bad. the entire effect of the bald headed monks rocking out is very comic. drew starts showing li and wu a couple of dance routines (old stuff the swim, the twist, etc.). everyone is having a great time.}
<B>__{angle on gao}
<A>__{glowering, as he moves toward the boom box. he reaches for the "stop" button. drew blocks the arm, and a pushing and shoving match starts.}
<C>__{gao}
<D>__{you're trying to get us all kicked out!}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i'm just trying to have a party. chill out!}
<A>__{they push and shove into the middle of the room, a couple of kicks and punches thrown, then they face off, ready to duke it out. the party is raging, while gao and drew are the only ones static, set to do battle. just then, the door starts to open. everyone freezes and looks toward the door, including gao. drew, meanwhile, has the presence of mind to jump onto the boom box, shutting it off and hiding it with his body.}
<B>__{angle on door}
<A>__{as the d.s. opens it and sticks his head in. he surveys the room, seeing the tableau of frozen monks, with drew lying on his bed.}
<B>__{angle on drew}
<A>__{who waves to the d.s.}
<B>__{angle on the d.s.}
<A>__{who knows that something is going on.}
<C>__{d.s.}
<D>__{go to sleep. lights out.}
<A>__{he hits the lights and then closes the door. in the semi darkness the room relaxes in a collective sigh. drew stands up and packs up the stereo. gao walks over past drew.}
<C>__{gao}
<D>__{it's not over, american.}
