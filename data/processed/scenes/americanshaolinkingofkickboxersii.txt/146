<L>__{exterior temple same day}
<B>__{establishing shot of very ornate temple.}
<A>__{drew walks up to the front of the temple, looks around for a moment, then takes a drink of water from the well out front. just as he starts to drink, a huge tour bus pulls up in front, air brakes hissing. before he can react, the doors open and a bunch of american tourists pile out of the bus and rush into the temple, jostling drew from side to side.}

<D>__{not another temple!}

<D>__{you have 10 minutes to be back on the bus.}
<A>__{the wave of tourists passes drew, and he stands there looking after them. then, as a group, they realize that they just passes a monk, and turn back to drew.}
<C>__{tourist 1}
<D>__{a real live monk! somebody, take my picture!}
<A>__{the tourist runs up to where drew is and stands next to him. the cameras click and whirr, and drew is thoroughly embarrassed. when the first pictures are over, and someone else wants to stand next to him, he raises his hands up to his face and bows.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{oh mi two fwo}
<A>__{he then turns and walks away.}
