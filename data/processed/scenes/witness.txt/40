<D>__{your sister said you don't have a family?}
<C>__{book}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{she thinks you should get married and have children of your own. instead of trying to be a father to hers. except she thinks you're afraid of the responsibility.}
<A>__{book gives her a look:}
<C>__{book}
<D>__{oh? anything else?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{oh yes. she thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. and you're the only one who can do anything. and that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.}
<A>__{book is staring at her. rachel nods.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i think that's what she said.}
<A>__{just then samuel belches with huge satisfaction, drawing looks from book and a couple of passersby. rachel smiles proudly.}
