<A>__{norah drags the mattress to the driveway. a wisp of smoke curls from the window behind her. as norah rubs her injured hand, she hears the teeniest meow rise from the bushes. she investigates. a little orange fluff ball at the base of some box hedges looks up with big startled eyes. norah smiles.}

<D>__{oh my god, you're the cutest thing ever. did you get left behind?}
<A>__{the kitten answers with a pitiful raspy sound that passes for a meow. norah is powerless to resist.}
