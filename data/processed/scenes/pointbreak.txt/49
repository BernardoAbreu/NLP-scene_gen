<L>__{exterior malibu pier dusk}
<A>__{big surf. rough conditions. closeout set. utah, board in arm, follows tyler out of the whitewater onto the beach.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{it's closing out completely. let's call it.}
<A>__{utah nods. his eyes track the unruly break.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{who's that?}
<A>__{a lone surfer slashing through the pilings of the pier. a real kamikaze run as the whitewater walls thunder behind him. silhouetted against a crimson sky and backlit spray the figure pumps among the pier pilings in a frenzy of motion that is somehow balletic. laying out bottom turns, torquing his body and blasting the lip a few times, moving so fast his long dark hair stands straight back as if he were leaning out a car window on the freeway.}
<C>__{tyler }
<D>__{that's bodhi. they call his the bodhisattva.}
<A>__{utah watches as the bodhisattva gets vertical with a snap, trims down the volcanic wall, carves the bottom, pivots, pumps to the top, gouging the lip, getting six feet of air. gawkers howl and shout praise at the manic surfer.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{the modern savage. guy's even crazier than you, johnny utah. c'mon.}
<A>__{they start to walk. the sky darkens as the sea finally closes out completely. the bodhisattva seems to levitate through the shapeless mush to shore.}
<C>__{roach }
<D>__{brah!}
<A>__{suddenly a football whistles through the air above utah's head. he watches as the bodhisattva, board under arm, walking out of the whitewater, makes a one handed chest catch. a few yards away two teams of surfers play football. utah gazes down the beach at the bodhisattva. almost 30 years old, his body lean and hard as a tree trunk. hardness in the face accented by long comanche hair.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{hey tyler!}
<A>__{she whirls. bodhi pumps his arm. tyler jogs back for the catch. bullseye. she shoots bodhi a look. something crosses her face. bodhi smiles. tyler doesn't. then it passes. she chucks the ball to utah. who drops his board and makes the catch in one move. he spins the football on his fingertip, drops it on his foot, kicks it up into his hands. razzle dazzle. he grins evilly.}
