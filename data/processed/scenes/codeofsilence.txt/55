<L>__{interior headquarters hall day}
<A>__{as eddie emerges, he bumps into the camacho's lawyer sanchez; thirty eight, well dressed, smooth as silk. sanchez sees the tableau in the room. as cusack walks down the hall the attorney follows him.}
<C>__{sanchez}
<D>__{let's cut the shit, cusack.}
<A>__{eddie ignores him.}
<C>__{sanchez}
<D>__{option 1: you can send em downtown. if judge collins didn't get laid last night, you can probably get him to arraign my clients for loitering in their own hallway. he'll set bail. i will take care of it. option 2: release them here and now and we'll call it a day.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{up to you.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i like to see you earn your money.}
<A>__{sanchez backs off. we follow eddie down the hall.}
