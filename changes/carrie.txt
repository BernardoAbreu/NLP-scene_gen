<ACTION>__{Carrie crawls farther and farther from the door, until she reaches the far end of the kitchen, just as Margaret, the knife gleaming in her hand, pointed toward Carrie, reaches the bottom of the stairs and turns toward the kitchen, mumbling all the while. Carrie flexes: the kitchen door swings shut. Margaret is coming toward the kitchen. Carrie flexes again  to hold the door shut. But it's no use  Margaret is relentless now, and the door opens. She raises the knife and starts toward Carrie, the door swinging behind her.}

It is followed by another and another as a rain of instruments strikes Margaret. Margaret collapses. Carrie, horrified by what she's done, starts toward her mother. And then she and we see Sue standing in the doorway, clasping her hand to her mouth, stifling her screams.}

Eleanor Snell, looking incredibly tired, is attending to the last-minute details of moving. She sorts through magazines and books, discarding some, putting others into cartons.
