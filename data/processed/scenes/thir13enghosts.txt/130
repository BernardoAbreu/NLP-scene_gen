<D>__{the world hasn't time for small people, arthur. people like you, or dennis. or kalina. it needs those who are willing to do anything, without question, for what they believe in.}

<A>__{arthur rises to attack, but cyrus stops him with a steel sword he pulls from his cane. he points the blade beneath arthur's chin. arthur's eyes dart around, searching for a last way out. cyrus spots arthur thinking...}

<D>__{i'm sorry, arthur. unlike jean, you haven't got a choice this time. now make the sacrifice. or your. children. will. die.}
<A>__{the chanting sound suddenly ends. silence. cyrus looks around in shock and confusion. as does arthur. that's when he sees bobby's scooter come rolling behind cyrus from the other side of the corridor. arthur quickly seizes the moment and kicks cyrus's legs, throwing him off balance and stumbling backward, right into the path of the scooter. like a banana peel, cyrus slips on it and lands on his ass. arthur scoops up the cane, as cyrus struggles to get back to his feet. when cyrus turns back around, arthur cracks him across the chest with the cane... sending cyrus sailing down the hall. he lands at the opening of the great hall, stunned by what just happened. he glances back at the scooter, then over to where it came. nothing. he slips on his glasses for a moment, and there standing casually in the corridor is the ghost of dennis rafkin.}
