<C>__{jack}
<D>__{makes your dictionary look a bit feeble, eh graham?}
<A>__{graham looks pained. marjorie notices.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{and ours too, come to that.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well, we're not the ones trying to impress her.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{clearly.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{david, what can i get you to drink?}

<P>__{(stung)}
<D>__{i'd better be going i have a stack of homework to do.}
<A>__{graham says his goodbyes. he tries to catch jenny's eye, but she looks away. marjorie shows him to the door.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yes. well. you can put the pop away now. what is there for the grown ups?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{a glass of something warming?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you know me so well.}
<A>__{hearty laughter from the two men.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{can i open anything yet?}
<A>__{marjorie comes back into the room.}

<D>__{wait for me.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{before you start on that little lot , i have a surprise. next weekend, we're all going to chez georges to celebrate jenny's birthday.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(flatly)}
<D>__{lovely.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{chez georges is in the boulevard st germain. in paris.}
<A>__{jenny giggles her delight. jack's smile is a little more forced.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how d'you mean, paris?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you know the one, dad.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(panic rising)}
<D>__{but..we haven't got any french money. and i'm not sure...i just don't think it would agree with me.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{dad!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{they don't like us, the french, you know. john sutton at work went once. they were very rude to him. i'm not sure i'd like that.}
<A>__{jenny understands david's ploy perfectly, and the role she must play. her eyes fill with tears. jack notices.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i don't want to spoil anyone's fun, but...it's not for me, europe. we'll go another time.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{you've just said you don't like europe. what's going to change? it'll have to be europe, won't it? because it isn't going to be you.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{i can take her.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(genuinely indignant)}
<D>__{to france? and leave me here on my own?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{oh, for god's sake.}
<A>__{jack looks cornered. he needs to find a way out.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{listen, i'm really sorry to have caused all this to do. i just thought it might be nice. but i will go with aunt helen and uncle daniel. they can have your tickets.}
<A>__{jack looks at him.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{aunt helen? the one who went to the concert with you?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yes, that's the one.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(relieved)}
<D>__{well, there we are.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(perplexed)}
<D>__{where are we?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{aunt helen! don't you see? if aunt helen's going to be there...}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(the penny apparently dropping)}
<D>__{of course!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i didn't want to put a spoke in anyone's wheels. but if you look at it from my angle...a bachelor, taking my daughter off to paris...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{oh, impossible. i hadn't thought it through properly. i do apologise, jack. would you prefer it if helen took jenny on her own? i don't mind. i've been to paris before.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh, i couldn't possibly ask...no, no. if aunt helen's going...}
<A>__{he smiles broadly. he's off the hook. jenny catches david's eye and smiles.}
