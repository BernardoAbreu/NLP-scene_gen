<L>__{interior ford explorer exterior railway crossing evening}
<A>__{the car screeches to a halt. della almost didn't see it. she is at a railroad crossing, the third car in line, and she almost rear ended the car in front of her.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{frick!}
<C>__{cassie }
<D>__{just a minute, della.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{i almost rear ended a car. cassie?}
<A>__{the phone cuts out. the train starts to go laboriously past. carriage after carriage of brand name building materials for new housing developments. della lights another cigarette. she turns on the radio again, finds a station playing "the sound of silence". the crossing gates go up. the cars ahead of her start. della shifts into drive. the phone rings its special tune again. della turns the volume of the radio down.}
<C>__{della }
<D>__{what's up, cassie?}
<C>__{cassie }
<D>__{i'm over at southeast plaza. what was it we need to get for pilates?}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{huh? one of those rubber balls, i think. i'm headed over there now. ran out of christmas wrapping paper. would you believe it?}
<C>__{cassie }
<D>__{it's hell here tonight. everyone and their uncle is at the mall.}
<A>__{della's phone makes a loud, distorted noise.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{aw shoot. my cell battery's dying.}
<A>__{she rifles about in the passenger seat, leans over to the back, and rifles about there among the kids toys, gives up.}
<C>__{della }
<D>__{damn, i must have left the charger in the other car.}
<C>__{cassie }
<D>__{you want me to pick up something for you while i'm here?}
<A>__{cassie's kind offer almost reduces della to tears.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{no....i'm just. i mean i'm. oh nothing.}
<A>__{the phone beeps again.}
<C>__{cassie }
<D>__{your phone's breaking up della. i'm not joking when i say it's packed over here.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{it can't be that bad?}
<A>__{the light up ahead turns amber then red. della stops.}
<C>__{della }
<D>__{why don't we meet somewhere for a drink?}
<C>__{cassie }
<D>__{sure, but a latte's about the best they can do in this mall.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{a latte's fine. let's meet at the fountain opposite victoria's secret.}
<A>__{the light changes and della drives up and over a hill.}
<C>__{cassie }
<D>__{sounds good.}
<A>__{the phone beeps again.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{my battery's going. i'm a block away. see you in five minutes.}
<C>__{cassie }
<D>__{okay but i won't be able to wait very ....}
<A>__{the phone beeps again. it's over. della lets it drop onto her lap. she opens the window and flicks out the remains of her cigarette. she waves her hands to fan away the smoke. she closes the window again. she's about to hide her cigarettes again when she changes her mind and stuffs them directly into her purse. as the car approaches the cusp of the hill she slows down to stare ahead.}
