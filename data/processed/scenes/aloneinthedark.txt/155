<A>__{the tunnel ends at the rungs of a metal ladder built right into the wall. aline shines her flashlight up it. a strip of light is visible way up high, at the top of a long shaft. aline climbs up the ladder. carnby climbs up behind her. burke shines his lamp down the dark tunnel. the crashing sound of impacts against the doors echo down the tunnel. burke looks at the remote detonator in his hand. the signal is inactive.}
