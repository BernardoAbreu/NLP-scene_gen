<A>__{long lens... the woman is peeling off her wetsuit next to a bathtub porsche that needs a paint job. her board is propped in the passenger seat. stereo is pumping. utah watches through binoculars from 50 yards up the road. the woman, in a bikini, towels off briskly. swimmer's shoulders. long muscular legs. lean and mean. she jumps into the car without bothering to open the door. looks at her watch her manner is late, in a hurry. through the tiny windshield we watch her shimmy and shake as she pulls her bottoms off and struggles into something else, not too concerned about the morning traffic right next to her. she pulls on a t shirt and them performs a houdini act to extract the bikini top out of one sleeve hole. utah watches impassively. he starts his car and pulls out onto pch to follow as the bathtub porsche zooms past.}
