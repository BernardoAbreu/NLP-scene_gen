<C>__{bud}
<D>__{hello again, i been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks.}
<C>__{darien}
<P>__{(uncomprehending)}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{grand marnier. a romantic and tragic drink.}
<C>__{darien}
<D>__{oh yes, i remember you.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{destiny took us apart, but i knew it would bring us back together.}
<C>__{darien}
<D>__{aha. poet or philosopher?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{stock broker. as in: never have so few done so little for so much. so what do you see in this?}
<A>__{bud indicates the painting in front of them a buffalo skull in the desert by georgia o'keefe.}
<C>__{darien}
<D>__{i'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.}
<C>__{darien}
<D>__{oh really?}
<P>__{(looks at him quizically)}
<D>__{well, i guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last june.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(chokes)}
<D>__{you could have a great beach house for that.}
<C>__{darien}
<D>__{sure you could, in wildwood, new jersey. if you sold this,}
<P>__{(indicates a rothko hanging near the o'keefe)}
<D>__{you could have a pretty nice penthouse on fifth. but you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{boy, i thought gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.}
<C>__{darien}
<D>__{not really. i'd say that gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. he has a great eye and he only buys the best. like this rug for instance, a silk tabriz, the finest of its kind. the day after he bought it in london, a dealer representing the saudi royal family offered him twice what he paid. it absolutely makes the room. see how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...}
<P>__{(she's really warming up to her subject now)}
<D>__{i don't know if i would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery too dingy. and it's a sacrilege having that pre columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. some dope might use it as an ashtray.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i gather you're a decorator.}
<C>__{darien}
<D>__{you got it, a great spender of other people's money.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.}
<C>__{darien}

<D>__{houseplant.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{oh it's just a rental. i'm moving to the east side soon. i've got a couple of deals brewing with gordon.}
<P>__{(shifts uncomfortably with his pretension)}
<D>__{but that's just conversation... what about real things? like dinner. the two of us. friday. cafe. santo domingo.}
<A>__{bud waits, staring suddenly and deeply into her eyes.}
<C>__{darien}
<D>__{what if i have a previous engagement?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{break it.}
<C>__{darien}
<D>__{i guess this must be destiny alright. my first yuppie apartment and...}

<D>__{my first yuppie.}

<C>__{darien}
<D>__{you really do believe in destiny?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{only if i want something bad enough.}
<A>__{her date, mr. gq, sammy ruspoli intersects with kate. a cultivated european air.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{...there you go again, darien, talking with strange men.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{that's our darien: elusive, reclusive, exclusive.}
<P>__{(to sam)}
<D>__{you know bud right? he works for gordon...}
<P>__{(sam nodding, makes conversation, big smile)}
<D>__{sam's in banking. you staying for dinner bud?}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(hesitant, eyes darien)}
<D>__{no, i'm afraid i've got to get some work...}
<A>__{kate noticing the doorbell ringing.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{...excuse me.}
<A>__{sam muttering something in darien's ear of an intimate nature. she glides away with him.}
<C>__{darien}
<P>__{(to bud)}
<D>__{call me next week, i will give you an estimate...}
