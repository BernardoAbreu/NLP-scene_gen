<A>__{john unscrews the license plate from a dusty black prius. he sticks the plate under his jacket, stands and checks over his shoulder as he walks out of the massive parking lot.}
<L>__{interior bank and mall parking lot day}
<A>__{a quiet neighborhood bank sits in the corner of an outdoor mall. the prius pulls into a spot; we dolly over to see the stolen license plate. inside the prius, john opens the backpack, puts on the hat and sunglasses and places the gun on his lap. and again he looks at the bank, tapping his toe manically. a guard opens the bank door for a departing customer, smiles and heads back inside. john tightens his grip on the gun, tries to work up his courage, but ultimately realizes he can't do this. furious with himself, he jams the car into reverse and backs up without looking. he hears a scream, brakes hard and looks. a woman screams. john stomps on the brakes. he leaps out of the car and sees a woman dropping her groceries and scooping her child up in her arms. call her elaine.}
