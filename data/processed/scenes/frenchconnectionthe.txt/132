<L>__{exterior sidewalk outside doyle's apartment bldg. day}
<A>__{a complex of buildings similar to lefrak city. a medium close view of a little girl about to run doyle down with a two wheel bicycle. two shots ring out in quick succession and tear up the concrete at a point where he would have been walking a moment earlier. doyle diving for the cover of a tree. the rifle goes off a third time and mothers begin to scream on the benches of the playground area.}

<D>__{everybody, down! get down on the ground!}
<A>__{doyle behind the tree, pulling his gun out of the ankle holster. he holds the gun ready and tries to look around. ping, another shot that drives him back. long panning view, doyle's view, from the ground, of all the rooftops in the area. a blank. the background sound is still screaming crying. "call the police." "the man's got a gun." "help! help!" the view is still slow, careful under the pressure of the panic. there's another shot. long shot of rifle smoke rising from nicoli's sniper position. exterior view of the concrete tunnels, doyle running from them toward the building, dodging and ducking behind playground equipment and benches as he does. he's shouting as he runs.}
