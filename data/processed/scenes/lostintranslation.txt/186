<A>__{bob looks at a fax from charlotte with a map, wondering if he's in the right place. it's quiet and looks like a generic office building. he goes in the little metal elevator, and the door opens on the 8th floor onto a little nightclub you would have never thought was there.}

<A>__{lights strobe and peaches' seedy "fuck the pain away" booms through the speakers. tan japanese strippers with platinum hair dance and hang from a pole on a little platform. bob sits alone on a brown ultra suede couch feeling out of place and empty. he looks over at a table of young american investment brokers. he wishes he wasn't there, but tries to seem comfortable. charlotte shows up with charlie and the other guys. she sits down next to him, and gives him an 'are you going to kill me?' look.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{how long have you been here?}
<A>__{he looks at her like it's been forever. she smiles for forgiveness. they look over and see a weird guy in the corner getting a lap dance, they look at each other, sharing the joke of the place, but both uncomfortable about the sexuality of it. through a beaded curtain, charlie and bambi get lap dances in a dark corner of pillows. charlotte looks at bob.}
