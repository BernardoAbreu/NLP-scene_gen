<L>__{exterior midtown manhattan night}
<A>__{arthur hurries up to a small group of tourists.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{the chrysler building. designed by william van allen...}
<A>__{a tour guide wearing a name badge reading `naomi' is talking. she is gorgeous, wearing vintage clothes, clutching a clipboard. we understand why arthur stopped the car.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{...and inspired by the machine age of the 1920s, this magnificent structure was the world's tallest building for 11 months before the empire state stole its thunder.}
<A>__{she looks out on her sullen, miserable tourists.}
<C>__{naomi }
<D>__{the chrysler got its name when the builder went bust in the 1928 cement famine and had to melt down his chrysler to make the pointy bit at the top. if you peer closely you can still make out remnants of a hub cap and a sticker reading `honk twice if you voted hoover.'}
<A>__{some tourists laugh. some don't. arthur's transfixed.}
<C>__{naomi }
<D>__{that was a joke, folks. it was built for the chrysler corporation.}
<A>__{naomi shares an eye roll with a newsstand guy who's clearly in love with her.}
<C>__{naomi }
<D>__{the spire is a beauty, especially on a winter's morning when the sun hits it and it just seems to...}
<C>__{grumpy female tourist}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{how tall is it?}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{1047 feet madam, not allowing for pigeon shit. okay, let's cross.}
<A>__{naomi leads the tourists across the busy road. she has to go back to grab a teenager in the headphones, who didn't hear. arthur hurries alongside naomi.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{can i join your tour please?}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{sure. it's $15, plus $5 for the free authentic street pretzel. sorry, my bosses make the prices.}
<A>__{arthur produces his wallet full of high end credit cards.}
<C>__{naomi }
<D>__{sorry. i can't take cards.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{ah, owe me it. i start on that corner every day on the hour...}
<A>__{just as naomi's reaching the other side, a cabbie, driving very aggressively, nearly hits her.}
<C>__{naomi }
<D>__{hey, you big blind jerk! doesn't your braille windshield work?}
<C>__{cabbie}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{!no me hinchan las pelotas!}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{peguelo encima de su asno, usted pinchazo grande su madre es un puta enorma y su padre no tiene ninguin martillo!}
<A>__{the cabbie's shocked but laughs and blows naomi a kiss. she smiles back.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{wow. what did you say?}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{just generalised criticism of his parents and genitals.}
<P>__{(to the tourists)}
<D>__{everyone make it over alive? excellent. next we enter times square, world famous for new year's eve, when a waterford crystal ball descends at eye poppingly slow speed for the inexplicable entertainment of a million drunk fools. many people think the square is actually a square, despite blatant evidence otherwise.}
<P>__{(to arthur)}
<D>__{sir? what shape is times square?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{a circle?}
<C>__{naomi}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{see? morons.}
<A>__{more tourists laugh this time. some...}
<C>__{grumpy male tourist}
<D>__{when do we get the pretzel?}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{soon, sir. soon.}
<A>__{she checks her watch and leads the party inside a laundromat.}
<C>__{naomi }
<D>__{okay, next the very laundromat once used by george gershwin, donald trump...}
