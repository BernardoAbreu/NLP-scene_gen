<A>__{pulling oliver lacon as he leads smiley and guillam down the hall, gesturing for his wife to take jackie away. he attempts some social niceties, but his tone is strained.}
<C>__{lacon}
<D>__{and how are you george? missing one's work, one's buddies?}
<C>__{smiley}
<D>__{oh, i think i manage pretty well, thank you.}
<A>__{they reach a large room, minimalist apart from a grand piano framed by vast glass windows. a tall, well built young man fawn stands on guard. lacon gestures to him and fawn opens the french windows and he and guillam walk out onto the terrace beyond. behind them, unnoticed, young jackie creeps back into the room and slips behind the sofa.}
<C>__{lacon}
<D>__{your wife, the lovely ann? she's in the pink, and so on.}
<C>__{smiley}
<D>__{very well. (beat) very bonny...}
<A>__{fawn closes the french doors behind him and lacon is suddenly all business.}
<C>__{lacon}
<D>__{do you know this man tarr?}
<C>__{smiley}
<P>__{(mildly)}
<D>__{i recruited him actually. in penang. good with women. likes to talk. what did he say to you?}
<C>__{lacon}
<D>__{he said he had some intelligence for control. had no idea he was dead. the news obviously hadn't reached wonga wonga land. then he said he would only tell it to someone outside the circus. if he couldn't have a minister, he would settle for the under secretary. lucky me.}
<A>__{lacon lights a cigarette, smokes a moment, building up to something. smiley waits him out. the room has become very still.}
<C>__{lacon }
<D>__{he said there's a mole. right at the top of the circus. and that he's been there for years.}
<A>__{smiley absorbs this. the moment is suddenly broken by a few stray notes from the piano. the two jump slightly and turn to where jackie sits at the keyboard, smiling triumphantly.}
