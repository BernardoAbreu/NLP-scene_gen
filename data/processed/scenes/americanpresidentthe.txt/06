<L>__{interior the oval office day}
<A>__{in the outer office, mrs. chapil, the president's secretary, is hard at work on a word processor. she stands as shepherd walks in }
<C>__{mrs. chapil}
<D>__{good morning, mr. president.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{how're you, mrs. chapil?}
<C>__{mrs. chapil}
<D>__{fine, thank you, sir. mr. kodak left the detailed breakdown of the approval poll for you. he seemed to indicate that it was very good news.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{sixty three percent of it, at any rate.}
<A>__{and by now they're in the oval office itself. shepherd has gone to his desk and is looking over the various overnight briefing memos that have been left for him. as someone used to doing six things at once, he has no trouble reading, listening, and talking at the same time.}
<C>__{mrs. chapil}
<D>__{lucy called just a moment ago. you forgot to sign her permission slip for her class }
<C>__{janie}
<D>__{ the museum trip. i will go get it.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<P>__{(to janie)}
<D>__{what time does she get home today?}
<C>__{janie}
<D>__{three twenty.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{how's my afternoon look?}
<C>__{janie}
<D>__{very crowded.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{schedule some time for me at 3:30.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{buenos dias, senor presidente.}
<A>__{this from robin mccall, a strikingly tall black woman and the president's press secretary, as she strides into the room.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{too tall mccall, how was mexico?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i didn't truly appreciate it until i came back and discovered that america isn't a great society.}
<C>__{lewis}
<P>__{(to robin)}
<D>__{he dumped a whole section.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{now there's a thing hanging out there.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{not a great society, sir?}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{well, with you out of the country, it wasn't, robin. now that you're back, we're great again.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{there's a press room full of people saying "what did he mean by that?"}
<C>__{lewis}
<D>__{see?}
<C>__{shepherd}
<P>__{(re: a memo he's been looking at)}
<D>__{a.j., did you get one of these?}
<A>__{this is said to a. j. macinerney as he walks through a separate entrance on the left side of the room. in addition to being the president's chief of staff and closest advisor, he's the president's closest and oldest friend.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{is that the letter from solomon at the gdc?}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{it would appear to be a letter from the entire environmental community. these people are outta control.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{i think they're just frustrated, mr. president.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{are they blaming the president for global warming?}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{well, they don't think he caused it, if that's what you mean.}
<P>__{(continuing; to shepherd)}
<D>__{sir, i'm on the phone with these people twice a week. i honestly don't know what they want at this pointerior}
<C>__{lewis}
<D>__{what they want is a 20 percent reduction in fossil fuel emissions.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{it won't pass at 20 percent.}
<C>__{lewis}
<D>__{we haven't really tried.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{lewis, mcsorley, mccluskey and shane hold too many markers. if we try to push this through and lose, there will be a very loud thud when we hit the ground, and that's not what you want in an election year.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{talk to the gdc again, a.j. tell them the president resents the implication that he's turned his back on the environment. tell them i will send 455 to the floor. but we're gonna ask for a 10 percent reduction. if they want to pull their support, fine. at 63 percent job approval rating. i don't need their help getting a bill passed. we gotta get going where's leon?}
<C>__{a.j.}
<P>__{(to an aide)}
<D>__{would you call mr. kodak and tell him the president's }
<A>__{a.j.'s sentence is cut short by the sound of a head on pedestrian collision in the outer office }
<C>__{mrs. chapil }
<D>__{aaagh!}
<C>__{kodak }
<D>__{sorry! sorry, my fault.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<P>__{(to the aide)}
<D>__{never mind.}
<A>__{leon kodak comes into the oval office. the white house pollster is a likable, if clumsy, numbers whiz. he, along with a.j., lewis, and robin, are regarded as the president's starting team. the people in this room have grown very close over the past few years.}
<C>__{kodak}
<D>__{excuse me. good morning, mr. president.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{you all right?}
<C>__{kodak}
<D>__{they keep moving that big ficus plant.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{we're all here, mr. president.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{okay. first, i wanted to say congratulations. three years ago, we were elected to the white house by one of the narrowest margins in history, and today kodak tells us 63 percent of registered voters think we're doing a good job.}
<C>__{kodak}
<D>__{wait a second. you wanted me to poll registered voters?}
<A>__{everyone laughs... even shepherd smiles...}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{but the poll also tells us what we already knew: we don't get this crime bill of ours through congress and these numbers are gonna be a memory. so, starting today, we're shifting it into gear.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{can i tell my morning press gaggle that gun control }
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{crime control, robin. gun control means we're wimps and we're soft on crime.}
<C>__{lewis}
<D>__{hang on, are we not }
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{lewis }
<C>__{lewis}
<D>__{are we not putting back the handgun restrictions?!}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{we're leaving 'em out.}
<C>__{lewis}
<D>__{sir, we campaigned on this issue. now, i understand we took it out when we were in the low forties, but we can push it through now.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{after the elections.}
<C>__{lewis}
<D>__{sir, we may never have an opportunity like this again. let's take this 63 percent out for a spin and see what it can do.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{we can't take it out for a spin, lewis. we need it to get re elected. for reasons passing understanding, people do not relate guns to gun related crime.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{robin, you can brief the press this afternoon. as of today, the crime bill's priority one on the president's domestic agenda.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{got it.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{leon, you're gonna run the war room. we're gonna need detailed projections for all the target districts by the end of the week. and, leon, don't be a nice, sweet guy from brooklyn. do what the n.r.a. does.}
<C>__{kodak}
<D>__{scare the shit out of 'em?}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{kodak}
<D>__{i can do that.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{lewis, we want you to be legislative liaison on this. you're gonna run the show on the hill.}
<C>__{lewis}
<D>__{can i just say, to return to the subject for one moment, that it might be easier to fight a war on drugs if we weren't arming drug dealers.}
<A>__{shepherd responds a little too quickly we see a spark of a temper.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{lewis, we've gotta fight the fights we can win.}
<C>__{lewis}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{we want to announce the crime bill at the state of the union, which is 72 days from today. the last nose count put us 18 votes short.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{eighteen votes in 72 days. thank you, everyone. janie, what's next?}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{thank you, mr. president.}
<A>__{the meeting's over. lewis, robin, and kodak say their "thank you, mr. president"'s as they exit.}
<C>__{janie}
<D>__{security briefing, sir.}
