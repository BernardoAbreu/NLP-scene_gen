<D>__{help... me... please...}
<A>__{he is dragged back underground. the group continues toward the mall entrance. suddenly a gun toting hunter is grabbed by a trapdoor. he goes cyclic, madly firing his gun into the air as he's dragged under. more beasts rise out of their dens. reaching for the humans.}

<D>__{keep going!}
<A>__{chris and the others flee toward the mall. some of them shoot at the spiders as they run. leroy is grabbed by a trapdoor. floyd tries to help but the spider plunges its fangs into poor leroy, dragging him under. the group clears the trapdoor minefield. but some of the spiders have vacated their dens and are coming after them.}
