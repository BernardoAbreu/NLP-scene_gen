<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{pov wes again we see through the binocular lenses. one of the iraqi soldiers is pushing around a shi'ite, having a good laugh about it, then casual as rain pulls out a gun and gives him a bullet, gift wrapped, straight to the brain.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{epps, wes, jaeger}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{jesus! what the hell did he do that for? they're iraqis. why are iraqis killing iraqis?}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{those people down there are shi'ites. you've got shi'ites in the south of iraq and khurds in the north. neither of them've got much love for saddam. probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{they're doing more than slapping.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{the shi'ites are on our side? i didn't know that.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{is there anything you do know?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i know you're a pussy. i know that.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{all right. let's get out of here.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{the soldiers are going to kill those people!}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{we have to do something.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{there's nothing we can do.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{we can fight. that's what we're here for: to fight the iraqis. to help the shi'ites, and the khurds.}
<C>__{jager}
<D>__{i didn't sign up to help any shi'ites. all we were supposed to do is get the iraqis out of kuwait, and if we aren't doing that then all bets are off.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{we carrying any ordinance?}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{some extra grenades. a claymore.}
<A>__{epps thinks, then shakes his head.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{not enough. we're out numbered and out gunned. they'd cut us to shreds.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{so good bye, shi'ites. thanks for playing. we have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{we're american soldiers. we don't abandon people.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{you're the one wanted to kill iraqis so bad.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i've got a new agenda now, it's get rich. the only way the iraqis figure into that is not at all.}
<C>__{epps}
<P>__{(to wes)}
<D>__{i don't want to see people killed any more than you. but we try to help out we die, and all we do is die.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{we can't just go off and }
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{there's nothing we can do. we shouldn't even be here in the first place.}
<A>__{there's a big, loud quiet as our boys just hang there. from down below comes another balloon burst; another gun shot. epps lowers his head. he wants to fight, but it's like he said: there's nothing they can do. epps slides back away from the rise, then jaeger, and finally wes disappears back the way they came.}
