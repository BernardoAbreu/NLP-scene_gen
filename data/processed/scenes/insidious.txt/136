<A>__{as josh and dalton streak down the corridor, each door opens and a different figure staggers out. grotesque figures...the solemn dead. pale skin, hollow eyes. their dead eyes drill into josh's soul. they want what he has life. they begin running chasing josh. dozens of them. josh stops, seeing that the corridor seemingly has no end. he yells in frustration.}
