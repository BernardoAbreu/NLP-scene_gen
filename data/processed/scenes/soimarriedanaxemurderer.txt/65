<A>__{he's on the stair master, stepping very lethargically. the telephone rings: he goes to answer.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{hello...}
<C>__{tony}
<P>__{(through phone)}
<D>__{not that it matters anymore, but i thought you should know someone just turned themselves in for the murder of ralph elliot.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{really? did she confess to the other murders?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{just the plumber so far, but she'll come along.}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{a little old lady from pacific heights. said he overcharged her on a leaking sink.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{really. leaky sink, huh?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{anyway, crime to stop. gotta go. i will catch you later.}
<A>__{tony hangs up. charlie stops pedaling on the bike. now he really feels like shit. harriet's not a killer. sherri's not a cheater. he races out of the bedroom. moments later he appears, puts on a pair of pants over his exercise shorts, then races out the door again.}
