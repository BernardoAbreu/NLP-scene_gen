<A>__{corey is standing in the middle of an unkept lawn, watching rob, about eighteen and wearing corey's helmet, ride corey's moped in circles around him on the lawn. he's treating the moped rather roughly, pulling wheelies and kicking the tail end out repeatedly. corey is watching impatiently, holding the baseball cap at his side. rob jumps the moped over the curb into the street, then turns up the driveway and pulls up alongside corey. rob removes the helmet.}
