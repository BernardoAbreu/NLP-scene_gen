<A>__{martin, maddox, and several of her supervisors are gathered outside the van as talley approaches martin sees him coming and steps away to meet him. she's pissed off and she wants answers }
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i want to know what in hell you're doing.}
<C>__{talley}
<D>__{i'm looking for you. i need your tactical unit.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i'm not stupid! you can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out }
<C>__{talley}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{don't question me, captain! this is my crime scene!}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(shouting over him)}
<D>__{ then when you get him, you damn near assault the man in the ambulance! what is going on?}
<A>__{talley glares at her, half a heartbeat from going off, and then he throttles back }
<C>__{talley}
<P>__{(simply)}
<D>__{i'm a negotiator, captain. i negotiate. that's all you need to know. now are you going to help me or not?}

<C>__{martin}
<D>__{maddox! let's give the man a hand!}
