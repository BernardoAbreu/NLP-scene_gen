<A>__{a bird's eye view of the hudson, over the george washington bridge, past the widest expanse of the river at the tappan zee, coming in now over the great lawns and old estates of the upper hudson valley, down towards annadale on hudson and the parrish country estate, which commands a beehive of activity, tents and workmen and vehicles.}

<A>__{the parrish astar sets down in its roped off landing area. the butler runs towards it to open the door, parrish and joe disembark. following the butler, they make their way through the maelstrom: tents being raised, platforms for music groups, portable pools with clusters of florists leaning over the edge to arrange lily pads within. parrish and joe move solemnly, observing the activity, not speaking to one another. although they are shoulder to shoulder, there is a distance between them. they walk on past chan deliers in the garden and fake trees with lights woven through their branches. adding to the confusion, the astar lifts off, the chandeliers rocking and floral pools rippling from the blast of the rotors. may, the housekeeper, appears.}
