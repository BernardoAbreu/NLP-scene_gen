<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{sandro comes out of the hotel and crosses over to the sunny square. he starts strolling down along a street which leads to a baroque church that opens up to a wide flight of stone steps. beyond these steps is a small dead end street that runs up against the faade of a large and magnificent old building. a few feet away from the faade, seated on a bench in the shade, is an old coachman whose horse is standing beside him with its head deep in a sack of hay. sandro goes down the flight of steps and approaches the door of the old building which is closed. he rings the bell but there is no answer. then he notices a time schedule posted on the door indicating visiting hours. after glancing at it, he walks over to the seated coachman.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{it's closed. isn't there any custodian or caretaker inside?}
<C>__{coachman}
<P>__{(apathetically)}
<D>__{nobody there.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{but it says it's open from 9:30 to 10:30., and it's ten o'clock now... that's a fine way to greet tourists.}
<C>__{coachman}
<D>__{tourists? last year a few frenchmen came here and they all walked around in their bathing suits. so they were made to understand that it was better if they didn't come at all.}
<A>__{sandro shakes his head and is about to say something but he sees the door opening and a man appears. sandro goes over to him.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{are you the custodian?}
<C>__{custodian}
<D>__{yes, come right in.}
<A>__{sandro enters and finds himself inside a large courtyard of noteworthy architectural design, though somewhat in a state of decay. the custodian goes on his way and sandro walks further into the courtyard where two young men are studying the architecture. on hearing sandro's footsteps, they turn around for a moment, then resume their observation. they are, in fact, young architectural students busily engaged in taking notes and copying certain architectural details. they do this with an extraordinary interest, almost with a sense of religious zeal. sandro continues to stroll through the courtyard. his footsteps are the only sounds to be heard disturbing the otherwise absolute silence. the two young students exchange words between each other but they speak in faint whispers, almost as though they were inside a church. sandro gazes up at the arcades, the columns, the windows. he is obviously filled with a painful sense of regret, resentful and bitter. he turns to look at the two young students who are deep in their studies and ignore his presence. but he is unable to ignore them; they plainly annoy him. in a certain sense, they humiliate him. he turns away and heads towards the exit, walking on the tip of his toes so as not to make any noise. then he goes out, quietly closing the door behind him.}
