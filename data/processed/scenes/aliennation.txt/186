<A>__{jetson, in another area of the docks, hears the echoing blast of the casull. he gauges as best he can the direction it came from and takes off running.}

<A>__{harcourt recovers from the jolt of the bullet impact. the cloth of his disheveled shirt is shredded and powder burned, but the bullet couldn't pierce his plated skin. harcourt smiles with grotesquely altered teeth, starts toward sykes. scared shitless, sykes rapid fires. one of his shots misses, shattering a crate beside harcourt's head. the remaining shots strike harcourt full on. harcourt is jerked by the impact of the bullets each time, snarling in anger but none of the hits stop him. the casull is empty and harcourt keeps coming. sykes stumbles back, but harcourt is on him in a flash. harcourt grabs sykes' arm holding the gun, yanks hard. we hear the pop as the shoulder dislocates. sykes hollers, and the gun jumps out of his hand.}
