<D>__{john? where are you, honey? it's late. you should come home, dear. i'm making a casserole.}

<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{something's wrong. she's never this nice.}
<A>__{in the voights' kitchen. todd comes through the kitchen's back door. just home from work. he ignores janelle and opens the fridge. grabs a carton of milk. takes a sip. frowns at the dog's barking.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{what the hell's the goddamn dog barking at? shut up, you mutt!}
<A>__{tight on janelle as todd growls around the kitchen behind her. he passes out of frame next to her. janelle switches the phone to her other hand then... thunk! her free hand seems to do something out of frame. there is a gurgling, and the sound of liquid dribbling onto the floor. (don't go away. we'll find out what happened in a moment)}
