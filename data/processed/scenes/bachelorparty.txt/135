<C>__{rick}
<D>__{cheese. i love you more than cheese. and i love cheese a lot.}
<C>__{thomersons}
<D>__{they hide their faces in their hands. off in the distance a storm is coming in fast over the ocean. the wind begins to pick up. undaunted, rick continues his soliloquy.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{in fact, more than dairy products in general. i love dairy. my love is cream. pour me on the cereal of your life...}

<B>__{rick}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{i think this song pretty much sums up the way i feel at this moment.}
