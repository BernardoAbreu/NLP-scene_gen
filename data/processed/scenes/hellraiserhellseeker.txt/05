<L>__{exterior car driving down country road day}
<A>__{the car lunges to the side of the road and weaves a bit in the gravel. up ahead a bridge approaches.}
<L>__{interior car day}
<A>__{trevor regains control of the car.}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{kristy! take it easy. everythings gonna be alright. com'on, start the breathing, with me... come on. one, two three, and blow..}
<A>__{trevor starts the lamanns method alone, as kristy appears to have passed out from the pain. she has her head leaned away from him and is limp in the passengers seat.}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{krist. honey. kristy!}
<A>__{kristy doesn't answer. trevors puts his arm on her and shakes her. she doesn't react.}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{kristy! honey wake up!}
<A>__{trevors attention is now on his unconscious wife rather than the two lane road which stretches across the bridge.}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{honey, wake up. please wake up.}
<A>__{and with that kristy's does exactly that. she lunges toward him in a violent spasm and scares the shit out of him (and us) which causes trevor to now completely lose control of the car.}
