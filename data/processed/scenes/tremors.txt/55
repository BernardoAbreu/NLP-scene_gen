<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior boulder field dawn}
<A>__{rich orange sunlight creeps silently across the deathly still desert. earl is already awake. val is curled up without his jacket, shivering. he wakes with a start. where the hell's his jacket? rhonda wakes slowly. she's surprised to find herself wrapped in val's jacket. touched by his chivalry, she embarrassedly hands it to baffled val.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{val glances at earl, who looks away. who, me?}
<C>__{val}
<P>__{(to rhonda)}
<D>__{no problem. anytime.}
<A>__{earl gropes through his pockets, coming up with only cigarettes. val fishes in his own pockets, finding only their lighter. they exchange items and light up during:}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{well, folks, what's the plan?}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{first let's see if stumpy's still out there.}
<A>__{this time he tosses a piece of wood out onto the sand. with soft rustling, a bulge forms in the earth, moves over to the wood, then subsides. rhonda starts looking around during:}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{don't he have a home to go to?}
<C>__{val}
<P>__{(grim)}
<D>__{well, that's why edgar never got down off that tower.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{i might have an idea...}
<C>__{earl}
<P>__{(ignoring her)}
<D>__{we're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{well, i was wondering if we could...}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{well, let's just run for it. we outran that one yesterday, at least on a sprinterior}
<A>__{rhonda gives up on them. she goes over and pulls a long cross rail from the fence during:}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{run for it? running's not a plan. running is what you do when the plan fails. you're not even trying to come up with a plan!}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{well, it's not like we've got a hell of a lot of options...}
<C>__{rhonda}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{you guys know how to pole vault?}
<A>__{they watch in surprise as she hefts her pole, checks the balance, eyeballs the distance to the nearest boulder. then she charges between them, plants her pole and vaults smoothly over to the next boulder, maybe fifteen feet away. the creature surfaces where her pole touched down, but too late a hook tentacle vainly sweeps the area, the disappears into the ground. val and earl glance at each other, impressed .}
<C>__{rhonda }
<D>__{we just stay where it can't get us...on these residual boulders. my truck's parked right next to one.}
<A>__{earl rushes to grab a couple more fence rails.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{stay on those residual boulders!}
<A>__{val just stands staring across at rhonda his horizons are broadening. earl stuffs a fence rail into his hands.}
<C>__{earl }
<P>__{(pointedly)}
<D>__{tammy lynn baxter, she do a lot of pole vaulting?}
<A>__{earl takes a deep breath and goes for it, vaulting across to rhonda. val follows.}
