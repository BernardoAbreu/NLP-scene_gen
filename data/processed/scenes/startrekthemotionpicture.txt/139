<L>__{interior v'ger kirk and spock (o)}
<A>__{closely approaching the inner wall now, timing their movements to coincide with the arrival of another "swarm" the wall begins opening. the "swarm" through, the wall begins closing but spock and kirk slip in before it closes.}
<L>__{interior "memory cave" spock and kirk}
<A>__{the wall closing behind them, they are safely inside. but as they stop their forward momentum, their eyes widen with awe and surprise at what they are seeing: what they see (m) the long "cave" chamber with its row of huge mediator balls extending into the distance. to one side, the gleaming crystal memory wall.}
<B>__{kirk and spock}
<A>__{as spock makes a quick analysis and estimate of what they are seeing. then, he takes out his tricorder again, propels himself toward the memory crystals. kirk follows.}
<B>__{at memory crystal}
<A>__{as spock adjusts his tricorder through several readings.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{it would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information. a remarkably efficient system.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(indicates)}
<D>__{and these 'sensor swarms' collect that data, carry it here.}
<C>__{spock}
<P>__{(nods; indicates)}
<D>__{new crystals: they must contain the most recent data obtained }
<A>__{and spock touches one of these new crystals (it will be shinier , more pulsating than the others): another rapid profusion of faint images, but this time including a pattern like image of klingon s, klingon vessel s (the ones destroyed by the cloud), and obvious starfleet personnel and the epsilon 9 statio n. also, a pattern of the security guard killed by the probe. and ilia.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{klingons... our epsilon 9 station ... and ilia!! they seem to be more than just images...}
<C>__{spock}
<P>__{(agreeing)}
<D>__{exact patterns. the energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon it dematerialized them, stored them. but why?}
<A>__{and he turns and begins moving on, studying the wall, consulting his tricorder.}
<B>__{across them to another section of the wall}
<A>__{spock inspecting this area at which the "newer" crystals are pulsating and glowing, and which appears to be a termination of the crystal area, continuing on and dis appearing through the wall .}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{if this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? or is their entire ship automated?}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{captain, i do not believe there is a crew or that this is a vessel as such.}
<A>__{a beat, as kirk reacts incredulously.}
<C>__{spock}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i am almost certain now that all of this is v'ger i believe that we are inside a life form, a living machine .}
<A>__{spock turns his spacesuit, turns his tricorder out to ward the mediator balls, takes a reading in that di rection. then a glance to kirk.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{i mus t attempt mindmeld with it, captain.}
<A>__{spock touches his spacesuit controls; the thruster jets move him out toward the mediator balls.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(warningly)}
<D>__{spock...}
<B>__{angle at mediator ball}
<A>__{spock reaching the ball, halts his momentum and removes one gauntlet , baring his hand. stretching the bare hand toward a part of it which looks strangely "alive." the very power generated from this area is clearly affecting spock's hand. meanwhile, kirk has used his thrusters to join him.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{spock, if you're right, its mind may be enormous ...}
<A>__{but spock pays him no attention, his entire being now focused on the pulsating glow of the "alive" area the camera moving in closer to spock, as he forces his hand toward that surface, closer, closer.}
<B>__{kirk}
<A>__{watching, almost mesmerized. torn between wanting to pull spock away from the wall and knowing that spock must go through with it. for everyone's sake.}
<B>__{closer on spock}
<A>__{preparing for the ordeal, moving his hand to the "liv ing area," the invisible force even stronger but spock's strength unwavering, and now he touches the surface and it flares with strange energy at the touch. and at the same moment spock' body convulses as if tens of thousands of volts of electricity are charging through him. close on spock's face as he begins to shudder with the shock, the camera continues into extreme close up as we see spock's mouth open he screams. camera into extreme close shot of spock's eyes. camera zoom through spock's eyes music in and up as we travel through abstract images (per con pederson discussion). symbolizing v'ger's incredible and complex store of mechanistic knowledge, these images suggest patterns of atoms, molecules, galaxies, dimensions of the universe beyond human knowledge or comprehension. it takes only fifteen or twenty seconds, but seems to span aeons, taking us through micro infinity and macro infinity.}
