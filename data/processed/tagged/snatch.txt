<A>__{we open on a guard sitting in front of a sentry post. he is wearing a heavy fur hat that covers his ears and a military jacket. behind him is a list of instructions (in russian). he 'sucks in a cigarette as though he's a drowning man lookin for oxygen. a car comes to a stop by the sentry post, the, guard looks, asks a couple of questions and is given an envelope which he quickly examines, he then attempts to stick his head in the car. a gun barrel is promptly stuck in his face and a couple of angry words emanate from the back, the guard jumps back and quickly raises the barrier. this next section will be intercut with the credit sequence.}

<A>__{franky knows discussion is futile. he flips the case open and pulls out a transparent plastic bag full of american dollars. the package is pulled out of the window, the driver doesn't move, we dissolve for a passage of time, the anxiety is more than obvious, but four fingers can do nothing. all of a sudden a package comes through the window and the car speeds off without waiting for an inspection of the delivery. franky opens the package and he reveals a stone the size of a fist. he shines a torch onto it and puts a stone inspectin monocle to his eye. he's satisfied.}

<C>__{gorgeous george}
<D>__{you want to stay down my friend, i promise you, you want to stay down.}
<A>__{micky ignores this and continues to pace, the big fella grabs him and puts him in a headlock and charges him into the stable door. there is a terrible noise.}
<C>__{gorgeous george }
<D>__{now you fucking stay down boy or you won't be coming up next time.}
<A>__{it appears as though this is going to get messy and any humour that might have been around has now evaporated. micky raises his head there is still no damage to speak of. all of a sudden he starts jumping up and down like he's warming up, throwing a few shadow punches, taking off his shirt. this reveals a heavily tattooed and scarred torso, and underneath these embellishments is a physique that warrants some respect.}
<C>__{gorgeous george }
<D>__{this is sick. i am outta here.}
<C>__{micky}
<D>__{you're not going anywhere my friend. you stay until the job is done.}
<A>__{micky starts pacing, and throwing out a couple of shadow punches with his back to gorgeous george, he still hasn't really acknowledged his opponent. gorgeous george moves in for the coup de grace, micky spins on his feet and catches the big man under the jaw.}

<A>__{we see gorgeous george lying on the floor with a head the size of a water melon. there is blood streaming out of every orifice in his head he's in.big trouble. we are in slow motion; there's a lot of activity going on around the body on the floor, their mouths are open but we can't hear what they are saying, all we can hear is the voice over given by tommy.}
<C>__{tommy }
<D>__{this isn't good, if george doesn't wake up in the next few minutes i tommy ( v . o . ) (cont'd) have a problem. i am scared, really fuckin scared. there is something coldblooded and practical about what these people are thinking. they will pop me like a hot sausage if george doesn't wake up. why do they want to go to the trouble of explaining why a man died in a campsite? these people don't exist in society, you can't find them, they live under their own laws and ignore everybody else's. i am scared, i am really fuckin scared.}

<C>__{sol }
<D>__{let me see your hands.}
<A>__{the man holds his hands up. he has got a perfect set of five fingers on both hands. sol puts his head in his hands. pauline and the other clerk put two bags full of coins on the counter. sol picks them up and frowns, he's not happy with a bag full of change. he puts his gun down and starts to rifle through the bag. pauline can see vinny's pistol on the counter, dropped after his encounter with the screen.}
<C>__{sol }
<D>__{copper coins? what do you mean copper fuckin coins?}
<A>__{pauline sees her opportunity and grabs the pistol. sol .goes for it too, but he's beaten to it. sol ducks, pulling vince with him, pauline lets out a series of shots in their direction, sol counter blasts over the top of the counter. the security screen comes flying back up.}
<C>__{vinny}
<D>__{get me out of here now sol.}
<A>__{vinny does sound convincingly desperate.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{we're going vin.}
<A>__{he grabs the bag of copper coins, grabs vince and marches towards the double'doors. they open the first set and then they try to open the second. they push the door nothing happens. there is no going back. sol starts to kick the glass door, but it doesn't budge. with panic rising swiftly, sol doesn't fuck around he takes aim with the handgun and fires, the bullet shatters the glass but it doesn't break through, and the bullet now ricochets off both glass doors shattering bullet proof glass all around them. vinny's panic filled eyes attempt to follow its trajectory. sol is unaware of the ricochet and before vin has time to warn him, sol fires another bullet. now he observes the problem and waits for the inevitable. the bullet tears through the bag of coins, which then empties its contents at vin's and sol's feet. eventually the bullet hits poor vince in the thigh. sol sinks to the floor, he has given up. amongst the yells emanating from vince we can hear sol's pathetic and desperate whimpering.}

<L>__{interior warehouse}
<A>__{micky appears from a small door at the back of the warehouse. he approaches the ring accompanied with shouts of encouragement and counter shouts. he's wearing a pair of semi cut tracksuit bottoms and a t shirt with grease marks down the front. turkish walks behind him, micky still looks bored. he climbs into the ring. then from the same door as the one through micky came out walks a larger character with a nose that appears to have seen countless rounds with a frying pan: horace 'good night1 anderson.}
<C>__{the reff}
<D>__{alright lads no eye gouging no biting. do your worst. back to your corners.}
<A>__{we drift again into micky's pov, his world is becoming more and more surreal. he can faintly hear turkish whispering words to him, but he's not really listening. a bell comes from somewhere, and micky instinctively walks to the center of the ring. "good night" is already there, they pace one another for a second or two, micky avoids a punch or two and then he takes a hard one and he knows it, we flash to white, micky's in trouble: he lets one of his missiles go and bang it shakes "good night" to his core, all goes quiet. we go to super slow motion: his knees buckle and "good night" is in trouble. micky maintains a frown as he watches his opponent's knees threaten to betray him. the crowd tries to digest what is happening. after a period of silence reality dawns. brick top mouths the words in silence."don1t go down you fucker". the crowd wants micky to finish the job. but common sense reins back the coup de grace. "good night" eventually regains control of his legs and stumbles forward, after a few sleepy punches he starts to provide a serious onslaught.}
<C>__{turkish}
<D>__{i don't like the look of this tommy, bring the van up to the back door.}
<A>__{this goes on for two rounds (which is montage down to a few seconds). we go in the mind of poor micky. we break the music just as it's starting to look dangerous... the bell goes and micky walks to the wrong corner. turkish pulls him back to his corner.}
<C>__{turkish }
<D>__{they are on ya. you got to hurt him micky. otherwise we are rumbled.... you hear me micky? do something, it looks like it' s rigged.}
<A>__{micky goes out again his hands are low, bang there is a flash of white as micky goes down in the dirt. dust rises from where he fell. he gets up quickly, his hands are still low, bang he goes down again, in no time he's up. bang: he hits the ground again and this time when he hits the deck, he penetrates the dust covered floor, like i t ' s made out of water. he falls through the water like he's sinking; his eyes are open and he can't breathe, he continues to fall, but he's unpanicked (he is now micky 1). when micky}
<L>__{1 looks up he can see himself in the corner of the ring takin}
<A>__{kidney punches from good night, he's winded and only semi conscious (this is micky 2). micky 1 makes the effort to swim up and tries to penetrate the floor but he's stuck he can't get through. micky 2 takes more punishment in the ring, as micky 1 ' s hand continues to try to break the underside of the floor but it stretches like rubber and forces micky 1 down again. micky 1 looks up again and sees how much trouble micky 2 ' s in the ring. micky 1 is panicking now, he's running out of oxygen and micky 2's being beaten, micky 1 starts to sink again but now flames tickle the bottom of his feet he looks up. and sees micky 2 being smashed to hell, his body eventually collapses and micky 2 falls through the floor. and as the latter falls through, micky 1 manages to rise from the depths and his punch manages to perforate the surface. the punch continues its trajectory and has the power to fell a red blooded rhino.... it catches "good night" on the jaw and it's good night for "good night" it's unlikely that he'll awake in the next hour. dear oh dear everybody is in trouble. again we cut to the reactions of the relevant parties.}
