<D>__{not just now, dear...}
<A>__{seeing carson approaching on his right, javal pulls his benelli shotgun from one of the saddlebags. he rests the barrel on his arm and fires a blinding white load of magnesium at carson. carson grabs the brake handles to slow down, and the blast crosses just in front of him. a few burning pieces pepper the front fender of the bike, but the bulk hits the concrete art deco statue in the entrance to the hollywood bowl. the statue shatters into a million flaming fragments.}

<A>__{speeds up. a car passing on the right bumps him. javal grabs for the handlebar to stabilize himself, dropping the shotgun. a helicopter appears, and flies just above him. then, spotting some police cars ahead, he quickly hangs a right, ducking onto alta loma terrace.}
