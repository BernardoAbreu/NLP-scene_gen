<L>__{interior great hall and throne room day}
<A>__{a short time later. the battle is over. the musketeers have won. on the dais, louis and anne confront richelieu who is a prisoner now, guarded by several musketeers. louis holds the recovered treaty in his hands. d'artagnan and the three musketeers stand nearby.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{your majesty, that document is an obvious forgery. i am clearly the victim of a conspiracy designed and perpetuated by these three musketeers.}
<A>__{richelieu assumes a trustworthy pose, one familiar to both king and queen.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{this is a complicated matter, your eminence, affecting both france and the crown...}
<A>__{a beat. as all wonder if richelieu will manage to elude blame after all. but louis continues with quiet authority, just a trace of humor. as king, and as a man.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{and so, until such time as i and my advisors }
<P>__{(gestures toward}
<D>__{anne; the}
<P>__{musketeers)}
<D>__{ can determine the whole truth of the matter. i invite you to await our decision in the comfort of... the bastille.}
<A>__{musketeers close in around the cardinal. he fumes, protests.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{you can't do this to me. i'm the cardinal of france.}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(never more certain)}
<D>__{and i am its king.}
<A>__{shouts of "long live the king! long live the king!"}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{and as king... i hereby reinstate the musketeers.}
<A>__{a tremendous cheer is heard from all. richelieu is led from the room. he pauses in front of d'artagnan.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{congratulations, monsieur d'artagnan. i will be keeping an eye on you.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<P>__{(unphased)}
<D>__{thank you, your eminence. i will be watching you, too.}
<A>__{richelieu smiles his crocodile smile. followed by guards, he turns and strides away, hands clasped behind his back, scarlet robes billowing behind him. louis turns to the musketeers. he indicates d'artagnan.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{is this the young man who saved my life?}
<A>__{porthos puts a hand on d'artagnan's shoulder.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{his name's d'artagnan, sire.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{approach, d'artagnan.}
<A>__{d'artagnan's heart pounds as he draws closer to king and queen. then he remembers, reaches into his doublet. and turns to the queen.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i have something that belongs to ... your majesty...}
<A>__{d'artagnan produces the bracelet he found on the country road. he holds it out to her. the king wonders, the queen smiles.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{thank you, d'artagnan. but the bracelet does not belong to me.}
<P>__{(off his look)}
<D>__{it belongs to her.}
<A>__{anne indicates constance, who steps forward, into view. d'artagnan and constance lock eyes for the third time. the thrill of recognition, the promise of romance, charges between. d'artagnan slips the bracelet around her wrist. constance kisses him on the cheek. louis continues:}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{d'artagnan, i am in your debt. what can i do to repay the courage you've shown me? anything, d'artagnan. whatever your heart desires...}
<A>__{d'artagnan knows what he wants. but he is tongue tied, unable to ask for it. athos asks for him.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{majesty, his heart has only one desire. to become a musketeer.}
<A>__{d'artagnan looks at athos, thankful for the intercession. louis answers with pleasure.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{then kneel, d'artagnan.}
<A>__{d'artagnan drops to his knees. louis lays the blade of his sword on each of his shoulders.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{the world is an uncertain realm, filled with danger. truth despoiled by broken promises. honor undermined by the pursuit of gold. freedom sacrificed when the weak are oppressed by the strong. but there are those who oppose these powerful forces. those who dedicate their lives to truth, honor, and freedom. they are a constant reminder to all of us. that such a life is not just possible, but necessary to our continued survival. as a country, as a king. these men are known as the musketeers...}
<A>__{as louis speaks, d'artagnan closes his eyes; countless images rush through his mind. his home in gascony, constance and queen anne on the country road, his first encounters with athos, porthos, and aramis, their adventures together, the face of milady. it's been a busy week.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{rise, d'artagnan. and join them. musketeer.}
<A>__{d'artagnan stands, transformed from boy to man. bells ring in the distance. constance smiles brightly, tears gleam in her eyes. athos, porthos, and aramis surround their young friend, and happily present him with the bright blue tunic of the musketeers. they slip the tunic over d'artagnan's head, react with a cheer. d'artagnan hugs each of the three. for each has given him gifts more valuable than gold. porthos, aramis, and last... athos. who, to the surprise of all who know him... smiles.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{do my eyes deceive me?}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{i find it hard to believe myself.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{his lips, unused as they are to such a contortion, twisted and stretched... into a smile.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{it was spectacular. and what teeth.}
<A>__{d'artagnan basks in their company, wonders aloud.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i know this is a stupid question. but what exactly does a musketeer do?}
<A>__{porthos and aramis exchange a glance. they're not so sure themselves.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{truth... honor...}
<C>__{aramis}
<P>__{(helpfully suggests a third)}
<D>__{and freedom.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{weren't you listening?}
<B>__{high angle}
<A>__{the three musketeers no, make that the four musketeers raise their swords, and clash blades together, causing them to give off sparks.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{all for one...}
<C>__{others}
<D>__{... and one for all!!}
<A>__{music soars. the curtain falls.}
