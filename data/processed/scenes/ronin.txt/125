<L>__{interior another car meanwhile night}
<A>__{deirdre once behind the wheel. the passenger seat next to her is empty, but as she drives we can see her eyes as they flick from the road in front of her, to the rearview mirror, which reveals a glimpse of the hideous face of seamus reilly. crashing through the windshield and the blast of fire have forever changed the way he looks: his face is now a mass of oozing wounds and burn tissue. in his eyes we see the light of a sick, twisted man who's gone over the edge.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{you better be careful, seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix.}
<C>__{seamus}
<P>__{(a hideous laugh)}
<D>__{plastic fucking surgeon?}
<P>__{(indicates his face)}
<D>__{you think i'm going to fix this, deirdre lass? it's the mark of the patriot, and i will wear it like a badge. as for those who done it to me, i will take my pound of flesh before this is all over.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{you're thinking with your gun, seamus, and not your head...}
<C>__{seamus}
<P>__{(losing it)}
<D>__{shut up!!!}
<P>__{(he puts a gun to her head)}
<D>__{shut up and drive! i'm your superior officer and you will do as i goddamn well say, is that understood?!?}
<A>__{beat. deirdre bristles at seamus's words but says nothing.}
<C>__{seamus}
<D>__{do i need to repeat myself?}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{no, seamus. i heard you the first time.}
