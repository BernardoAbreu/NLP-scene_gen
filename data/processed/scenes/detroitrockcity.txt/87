<A>__{roadies and techies run in all directions as last minute preparations are being attended to. two roadies carry the base drum down a long ramp unaware that lex is hidden inside.}
<D>__{roadie #2 boy, this one's heavy.}
<A>__{suddenly, roadie #2 snags his foot on a mess of cable and loses his balance, dropping the oversized drum. in an instant the drum goes rolling down the ramp quickly gaining speed.}
<D>__{roadie #2 shit!}
