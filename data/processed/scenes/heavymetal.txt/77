<A>__{girl's bedroom entering, taarna sees the slimy silk like cocoon on the bed. the basket of fruit still sits on the floor. from within the webbing, the green ball is glowing brightly. taarna looks at the parchment in her sack, then at the glow coming from the cocoon. cautiously, she approaches the cocoon, sword drawn. suddenly a hand from within the cocoon grabs the ball and shoots forward, ripping through the webbing and holding the ball up to taarna's face. the hand belongs to a hideously ugly witch, who emerges from the cocoon, cackling through snake like fangs.}
