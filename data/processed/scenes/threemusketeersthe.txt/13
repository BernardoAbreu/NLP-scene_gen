<L>__{exterior high road to paris day}
<A>__{d'artagnan, on horseback, pauses on a bluff overlooking the magnificent city on the seine. what he beholds is paris as it looked in the early part of the seventeenth century, its steeples and towers rising to meet the sky. for a country boy like d'artagnan, paris is a magical place where the wildest of dreams can come true. d'artagnan's reverie is broken by the sound of thundering hoofbeats coming from behind. he turns in response and what he sees is this: two women on horseback are riding for all they're worth pursued by two men on horseback. d'artagnan his heroic blood stirs. women in danger! as the women gallop past, d'artagnan leaps from his horse. quickly formulating a plan, he clambers up the trunk of a nearby tree and climbs out on a branch that overhangs the road.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{as the two riders pass underneath, d'artagnan leaps into space and tackles one of them, knocking him out of the saddle. the rider hits the ground and is knocked senseless. one down. d'artagnan scrambles to his feet as the second rider reverses direction and gallops back, charging d'artagnan. the rider draws his saber. d'artagnan dodges the horse and the sword. he catches the second rider's arm and yanks him right out of the saddle. the man lands with a painful thud at d'artagnan's feet. before he can recover, d'artagnan is upon him with flying fists. one swift punch and the second rider is senseless. two down. d'artagnan stands over his two victims, out of breath, but greatly pleased with his performance. he looks up as the two women ride back to see what's happened. the first woman is of noble breeding, a beautiful darkhaired girl in her late teens. her name is anne. her companion is roughly the same age, titan haired and equally beautiful. her name is constance. anne regards the two men on the ground, then d'artagnan. she shakes her head, laughs with delight and rides off. constance remains. she smiles down at d'artagnan from atop her horse.}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{do you have any idea what you've done?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i've saved you and your friend from these bandits.}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{these 'bandits' are the queen's own bodyguards.}
<A>__{d'artagnan is stunned.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{the queen?}
<A>__{constance points a finger in anne's direction.}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{if i were you, i'd make myself scarce. these men are going to be very angry when they wake up.}
<A>__{d'artagnan looks at the two bodyguards who are beginning to recover. then he looks up at constance, feeling like a prize idiot.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i didn't know. i thought...}
<A>__{constance smiles at him, her eyes twinkling.}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{do you have a name?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{d'artagnan.}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{you're a very foolish boy, d'artagnan... but a very handsome one. good bye.}
<A>__{constance spurs her horse and rides off to catch up with anne.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<P>__{(calling after her)}
<D>__{wait! you didn't tell me your name!}
<A>__{but constance is gone. d'artagnan stands in the middle of the road, feeling foolish and oddly thrilled at the same time. the two bodyguards groan and grumble. a bright reflection catches d'artagnan's eye. he looks down and sees a gleaming bracelet. he picks it up and...}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{the man who attacked you...}
<P>__{(pointing in the opposite direction)}
<D>__{... went that way.}
<A>__{with a guilty smile, d'artagnan spurs his horse and rides like hell.}
