<A>__{she holds her toe, annoyed with her klutziness. john talks to her from the shower.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{at the fitting, they had all these rock n roll clothes, the label guys kept saying lock n loll, though, but the band doesn't look tough at all...they look better just skinny and nerdy, like how when they came in...they looked so uncomfortable in these keith richards clothes, they should just be like they are, don't you think?}
<A>__{she's drifted off.}
<C>__{charlotte}

<A>__{he gets out and is rushing to get his stuff together to go. charlotte's lounging on the bed in her new pink underwear. she tries her scarf on that she's been knitting.}

<C>__{john}
<D>__{you don't have to be embarrassed.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{i'm not. it's just corny, but i'm not into it.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{it's ok if you are.}
<A>__{he kisses the side of her face and her shoulder like a cute pet, and then continues getting his stuff together. john sets two bottles of cristal on the bed next to her, not really seeing her.}

<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{i love you.}
<A>__{he tackles her, kisses her, bites her, grabs her ribs, tickling her in a burst of affection. she laughs, her arms around his neck.}
