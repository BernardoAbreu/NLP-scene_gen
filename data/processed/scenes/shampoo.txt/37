<B>__{george}
<A>__{is threading his way through a crowd, holding two drinks, one of them a coca cola. it's a little more raucous now, with election returns from the television sets creating a more festive mood. now and then someone jumps up from a set and hugs someone so carrying drinks is a little dodgy. jackie, f.g. lester, b.g., talking jackie sits alone by the bar, an unlit cigarette in her mouth. a man offers her a match. she stares at the burning match as if it's obscene. she blows it out.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{no thanks.}

<D>__{george? was he alone?}
<C>__{pope}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{well did he go in there with jackie?}
