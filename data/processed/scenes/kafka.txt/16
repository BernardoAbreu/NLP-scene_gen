<T>__{cut:}
<A>__{an office trolley day similarly coffin like, loaded with files.}
<B>__{kafka}
<A>__{edges out of the way to let it by, feeling as though it has been made for him, is waiting for him. he walks on to the chief clerk's office. chief clerk's office kafka comes in.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{you wanted to see me, sir.}
<C>__{chief clerk}
<P>__{(indicates a chair)}
<D>__{sit down, kafka.}
<A>__{kafka does. and the chief clerk stands up. he paces up and down a bit, making kafka awfully nervous before he finally clears his throat and starts to get to the pointerior}
<C>__{chief clerk}
<D>__{you've been with the firm for nearly nine years. you've done your work diligently, there are no complaints on that score. but there's more to the job than the work there are other people to consider and frankly, kafka, we eel your social situation could bear improving.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{... my ... social situation?}
<C>__{chief clerk}
<D>__{you keep too much to yourself you're a lone wolf. it makes me uneasy, and if it makes me uneasy i can't imagine the impression you make on lesser employees.}
<A>__{the chief clerk, towering over him, also reminds kafka of his father. kafka tries putting up a defense.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{to do my work well, i have little time for }
<C>__{chief clerk}
<D>__{you must make the time. where do you go off to in the lunch hour?}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{i usually take lunch by the river.}
<C>__{chief clerk}
<D>__{it's not healthy, kafka not for you and not for your workmates. at the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{i did not realize it was obligatory.}
<C>__{chief clerk}
<D>__{have you never wondered and i mention this only in passing }
<P>__{(as he paces past and kafka turns his head)}
<D>__{why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<C>__{chief clerk}
<D>__{attitude, kafka. it doesn't matter how well you do your work you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in.}
<C>__{kafka}
<P>__{(leans forward in rebuttal)}
<D>__{well, i }
<C>__{chief clerk}
<P>__{(keeps pacing)}
<D>__{oh, i know you got along with that poor fellow what was his name?}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{ eduard }
<C>__{chief clerk}
<D>__{ yes raban but he was too much like you even more so perhaps. he wasn't here as long as you, so i didn't know him as well but i could see the influence he was having. i simply want you to be aware of this because you'll be happier for it.}
<A>__{kafka merely nods, starts to get up.}
<C>__{chief clerk}
<D>__{in any case don't ask me why the word has come down you're to be promoted.}
<A>__{kafka sits back down in the chair.}
<C>__{chief clerk}
<D>__{your colleague's death has helped precipitate the need, though i can tell you it's been under consideration for some time. you're to be given two assistants and a commensurate rise in salary.}
<P>__{(sits back behind desk)}
<D>__{that's all.}
<A>__{kafka nods once, starts to go again.}
<C>__{chief clerk}
<D>__{kafka.}
<A>__{kafka turns.}
<C>__{chief clerk}
<D>__{i understand you fancy yourself an author.}
<C>__{kafka}
<P>__{(almost visibly cringes)}
<D>__{in a small way.}
<C>__{chief clerk}
<D>__{you might find a more athletic hobby put some color in your cheeks.}
<A>__{he returns to his paperwork. kafka leaves. outside chief clerk's office walking away, kafka notices gabriela striding along an office corridor and sneaky burgel confronting her.}
<B>__{gabriela}
<A>__{she looks distressed, walking tall as if to bolster her composure. sneaky burgel does not help matters by characteristically appearing from the sidelines.}
<C>__{burgel}
<D>__{good morning }
<P>__{(she ignores him)}
<D>__{or should i say good afternoon?}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{say what you like no one pays the least attention.}
<C>__{burgel}
<P>__{(walking quickly alongside her)}
<D>__{oh, don't they? i think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{not today, burgel. send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for god's sake don't bother me today.}
<C>__{burgel}
<D>__{it's my place to offer advice, not yours and by advising the chief clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<P>__{(stops to glare at him)}
<D>__{you're just doing your job.}
<C>__{burgel}
<D>__{it's what i'm paid to do.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{you're detestable.}
<C>__{burgel}
<D>__{and you're late!}
<A>__{suddenly, in a terrific release of pent up emotion, she slaps him hard across the cheek, the first of what would be a flurry of blows if not for the fact that the unexpected force of it throws burgel reeling backwards before she can deliver any more. instead she rushes away, very upset.}
<B>__{kafka}
<A>__{as startled as the rest of the office by the incident. burgel recovers, straightening up in shock and embarrassment. he immediately resolves to march directly to the office of the chief clerk. seeing him coming, kafka quickly starts away.}
