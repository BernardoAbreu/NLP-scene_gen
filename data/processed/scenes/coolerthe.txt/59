<L>__{interior shelly's office night}
<A>__{the door to shelly's office slams behind natalie. shelly glares at her from behind his desk. we see him thumbing his steel abacus. the beads drifting toward the center. natalie shakily lights up a cigarette.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{put that fucking thing out!}
<A>__{natalie, startled, drops her cigarettes. she kneels to gather them up.}
<C>__{natalie}

<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{you should be. you've gone and fucked it up big time. i paid you to be his cooze companion, not his fucking true love. but, no, you had to go and get all profound on the poor schmuck.}
<P>__{(mimics female voice)}
