<L>__{interior living room, lambert home night}
<A>__{high ceilings. exposed beams. spanish style windows. renai treads across wooden floorboards into a sunken living room. no matter careful she is, there is a loud creak with each step. a grandfather clock in the corner ticks steadily. there is barely any furniture in here, only a bookcase and a piano. what there is a lot of...is boxes. large moving boxes. renai plops cross legged onto the floor and rips open one of the boxes, marked books. she plucks out a handful of books and lines them up on the bookshelf. then another handful. they are all self help and self improvement books. titles like `be the better you' and `inch by inch, it's a cinch: a guide to achieving your goals' pop out. she spots a sealed box labelled photo albums. she strips away the tape and wrestles out a dusty album of wedding photos. smiling faces greet her as she thumbs through the pages. the happy couple. young. glowing. sadness washes over her.}

<D>__{okay...as of yet, our tests have not drawn any conclusive answers for you. repeated blood and csf cultures are normal, making an infective origin highly unlikely. tests for lyme disease and repeated polymerase chain reaction are negative. systemic vasculitis was ruled out. dalton remains in an areactive coma without focal signs or abnormal brainstem reflexes.}

<D>__{tell me!}
<A>__{suddenly, renai charges forward, snatching the sketch book. the drawing is of a hideous form crouched in the corner of the ceiling, staring down at dalton below. it is the red faced demon lorraine saw earlier. his naked body is charcoal black...whilst also strangely translucent, the veins visible underneath the flesh. a corpulent stomach juts out, as if he were pregnant. terrified, renai flicks on the light revealing nothing but an ordinary ceiling.}

<L>__{exterior new house night}
<A>__{it's over. specs and tucker haul a large tripod case to their van, heaving it into the back. they stand in awkward silence. it's been a long day.}
<C>__{tucker}
<D>__{i guess you did some pretty awesome stuff in there. you deserve some credit.}
<C>__{specs}
<D>__{you did good too in an assistant type way.}
<A>__{tucker can't hold his stoic pose any longer. he breaks out laughing, followed quickly by specs.}
<C>__{tucker}

<C>__{dalton}
<D>__{i'm tired.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{too bad. i'm never letting you go to sleep again.}

<C>__{renai }
<D>__{whenever you're lost...we'll always come and find you.}
<A>__{they hug.}
<L>__{interior living room, new house night}
<A>__{josh wanders out of the kitchen, examining the house as if seeing it for the first time. he is smiling...happier than we have ever seen him. elise sits on the couch amongst the remains of tucker's paraphernalia of the paranormal. josh approaches her, standing over her.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{you introduced me to a new world.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{no. you've been there before, remember? and you'll go back.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{all of us will...eventually.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{maybe i can forget again.}
<A>__{he reaches into his jacket, taking out the eerie photos lorraine gave him of himself as a child.}
<C>__{josh }
<D>__{i will start by giving these back.}
<A>__{as he hands them to elise, she sees with fear that his hand is withered and wrinkled. like the hand of an eighty year old woman. shocked, she looks up at his face.}
<C>__{josh }
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<A>__{elise stands. she looks haunted. her eyes wide and unnerved.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{nothing, i...}
<A>__{she turns away, reaching for something.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{what's the matter, elise?}
<A>__{she spins around and lifts tucker's camera up to her face, aiming it at him. she depresses the trigger and takes a photo of him, bathing the whole corridor in white light. josh recoils back in shock. elise lowers the camera. she is terrified. josh suddenly lunges at her, slapping the camera out of her hands.}
<C>__{josh }
<D>__{why the fuck would you do that? why would you do that? why?!}
<A>__{he slams her against the wall, his hands around her throat. elise chokes in terror, terrified of him.}
<C>__{josh }
<D>__{you of all people! you know! why would you do that to me when you know what you know? you bitch!}
<A>__{he abruptly stops attacking her, staggering backwards, examining his hands as if he can't believe what he's done. seething with fury. panting. elise collapses, catching her breath. josh swipes a framed photo off the wall and storms away, heading down the corridor... ...swallowed up by the darkness.}
<L>__{interior master bedroom, new house same time}
<A>__{renai furrows her brow.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{what was that?}
<P>__{(beat; to dalton)}
<D>__{stay here.}
<A>__{she gets up.}
<L>__{interior living room, new house night}
<A>__{renai jogs into the living room. sees elise lying on the floor.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{elise, what was that noise?}
<A>__{elise simply looks up at her. the utter terror on her face is palpable. her neck is bleeding from scratch marks.}
<C>__{renai }
<D>__{jesus...what happened to you?}
<A>__{elise just stares, unable to speak. her fear is contagious.}
<C>__{renai }
<D>__{where's josh?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{josh? josh?!}
<A>__{she turns and runs into the corridor, flicking on the lights. there is nobody there.}
<L>__{interior corridor, new house continuous}
<A>__{renai dashes from room to room in the hallway, pitching each door open. each room is empty. josh is nowhere to be found.}
<L>__{interior living room, new house same time}
<A>__{elise stares at tucker's camera in a state of catatonic dread. renai backs into the room, her own fear rising in her gut. she leans down and grabs elise by the shoulders.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{elise, what happened? you're scaring me, tell me where josh is?}
<A>__{elise finally looks up at her. seeing the "expert" so afraid unnerves renai. when the lion tamer drops his whip and runs, you know the lion is vicious. elise opens her mouth to speak...but nothing comes out. instead, she simply holds up the camera, showing renai the digital display of the photo she took. we do not see it. we simply see the look of horror on renai's face.}
<T>__{flashcut to:}
<L>__{interior living room, new house night flashback}
<A>__{we have returned to the previous scene only now we are seeing it through elise's eyes. elise is sitting on the couch, alone. trying to recover from the nights events. she glances up when josh approaches her.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{you introduced me to a new world.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{no. you've been there before, remember? and you'll go back.}

<C>__{josh}
<D>__{maybe i can forget again.}
<A>__{once again, we see him reach into his jacket, taking out the photos lorraine gave him.}
<C>__{josh }
<D>__{i will start by giving these back.}
<A>__{as he hands them to elise, she sees with fear that his hand is withered and wrinkled. shocked, she looks up at his face.}
<C>__{josh }
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<A>__{elise stands up, not knowing how to react.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{nothing, i...}
<A>__{she turns away, reaching for something. we see her scoop up tucker's digital camera.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{what's the matter, elise?}
<A>__{she spins around and lifts tucker's camera up to her face, aiming it at him. she depresses the trigger and takes a photo of him, bathing the whole corridor in white light. and in that split second, josh is replaced by the old woman! elise lowers the camera, horrified. for a beat, the old woman just glares at her... ...then she charges at elise, arms outstretched, wrapping her white hands around the soft flesh of elise's throat. elise chokes, eyes bulging, spittle flying from her mouth, as the pale hands of the old woman dig into her thorax, droplets of blood running down her chest where the yellowing finger nails have cut in : to the flesh. the old woman smiles a merciless harlequin grin that mocks elise's pain. she lets elise go, letting her drop to the floor. the old woman turns and glares down the corridor. something has caught her attention. a distant scream.}
<L>__{interior bathroom, new house night}
<A>__{the door groans open, a blade of light penetrating pitch black darkness. the silhouette of the old woman floats ethereally into the bathroom. she steps up to the mirror, then reaches into her tattered victorian dress and produces a candle. she lights the candle with a match, holding it beneath her chin and glaring into the reflective surface of the mirror. instead of seeing her own reflection though, she sees through the mirror as if it were a window. in it, she can see the basement of the lambert's previous residence. josh bursts into the basement, carrying dalton.}
<C>__{dalton}
<D>__{put me down, i can run!}
<A>__{josh sets dalton down, who scampers up the stairs. we are watching the same scene we saw earlier play out in the mirror. josh is about to follow when he turns and spies a familiar face. he looks at the old woman...seeing her through the `window'.}
<C>__{dalton }
<D>__{come on, dad! come on!}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{go! i'm right behind you!}
<A>__{dalton disappears as josh glares at the woman.}
<C>__{josh }
<D>__{you...what do you want from me?}
<A>__{he approaches the mirror. we circle around the old woman, past the mirror and through the bathroom wall, emerging on the other side in }
<L>__{interior basement, lambert home, inside the further}
<A>__{ the basement. josh screams at the old woman as she stares at him through what he thinks is a window. they have swapped places. he is now in the further, and she is in our world.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{get away the fuck away from me. i'm not scared of you, just leave me alone! get away from me!}
<A>__{we keep circling, wiping past josh's back and completing a}
<L>__{360 degree turn, through the wall and back into interior bathroom, new house continuous}
<A>__{ our world. the old woman smiles at josh's rage. she finds it amusing. with an eerily unblinking gaze, she snuffs out the plume of flame with a single puff of breath...plunging the bathroom into darkness... ...and snuffing out josh forever... ...and ever.}
