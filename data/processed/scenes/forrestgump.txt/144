<C>__{forrest }
<D>__{every day we'd take a walk, and i'd jabber on like a monkey in a tree. and she'd listen about ping pong and shrimpin' boats and momma makin' a trip to heaven. i did all the talkin'. jenny most of the time was real quiet.}

<A>__{jenny's old house stands at the end of the dirt road. it appears to be deserted. jenny walks toward the house and stops. she stares at the house. forrest walks toward jenny. jenny suddenly heaves a rock angrily at the house. she throws other things at the house.}
