<L>__{exterior grassy plain day}
<A>__{the jeep tows the double trailer to the edge of a grassy plain just beyond the lagoon, overlooking the interior of the island. the noon sun is high overhead; below, the valley shimmers in midday heat. eddie connects a flexible cable to the jeep's power winch and flicks it on. the cable turns slowly in the sunlight. moving along the length of it, we see the cable leads to a pile of aluminum, some kind of strut assembly painted a camouflage color. as the winch pulls the cable tight, the jumble of thin struts begins to move, slowly rising into the air. the emerging structure climbs, spidery, struts unfolding, fifteen feet into the air. the light house at the top (the cage that was tested back at eddie's workshop) is now just beneath the lowest branches of the nearby trees, which almost conceal it from view. nick lights a cigarette and carelessly tosses the match on the ground. malcolm notices.}

<D>__{listen. i know you all have probably concluded that i'm out of my mind.}
<A>__{is it our imagination, or did the trees behind malcolm just sway slightly?}
<C>__{malcolm }
<D>__{that's all right, for now. but just humor me and be careful.}
<A>__{no, it's not our imagination, there they go again. whole trees shivering and swaying from left to right and back again.}
<C>__{malcolm }
<D>__{even if you think i'm harmless and deluded, i promise }
<A>__{now the trees creaks and groan as they sway. everyone has seen it, and now malcolm turns around too.}
<C>__{malcolm }
<D>__{ this place is for real.}
