<L>__{interior nick's bar night}
<B>__{close shot}
<A>__{it is martini's place, but almost unrecognizable. the cheerful italian feeling is gone. it is now more of a hard drinking joint, a honky tonk. same bar, tables have no covers. people are lower down and tougher. nick the bartender is behind the bar. george and clarence come in. george does not notice the difference, but clarence is all eyes and beaming. they go up to the bar.}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(as they come in)}
<D>__{that's all right. go on in. martini's a good friend of mine.}
<A>__{two people leave the bar as they approach.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{there's a place to sit down. sit down.}
<C>__{medium closeup}
<D>__{nick is wiping off the bar as they sit down.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{oh, hello, nick. hey, where's martini?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you want a martini?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{no, no, martini. your boss. where is he?}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(impatient)}
<D>__{look, i'm the boss. you want a drink or don't you?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{okay all right. double bourbon, quick, huh?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{okay.}
<P>__{(to clarence)}
<D>__{what's yours?}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{i was just thinking...}
<P>__{(face puckers up with delicious anticipation)}
<D>__{it's been so long since i...}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(impatient)}
<D>__{look, mister, i'm standing here waiting for you to make up your mind.}
<C>__{clarence}
<P>__{(appreciatively)}
<D>__{that's a good man. i was just thinking of a flaming rum punch. no, it's not cold enough for that. not nearly cold enough... wait a minute... wait a minute... i got it. mulled wine, heavy on the cinnamon and light on the cloves. off with you, me lad, and be lively!}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{hey, look mister, we serve hard drinks in here for men who want to get drunk fast. and we don't need any characters around to give the joint atmosphere. is that clear? or do i have to slip you my left for a convincer?}
<A>__{as he says this, nick leans over the counter and puts his left fist nearly in clarence's eye. clarence is puzzled by this conduct.}
<C>__{clarence}
<P>__{(to george)}
<D>__{what's he talking about?}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(soothingly)}
<D>__{nick nick, just give him the same as mine. he's okay.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{nick turns away to get the drinks.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what's the matter with him. i never saw nick act like that before.}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{you'll see a lot of strange things from now on.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{oh, yeah. hey, little fellow you worry me. you got someplace to sleep?}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you don't huh? well, you got any money?}
<A>__{nick is listening suspiciously to this conversation.}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{no wonder you jumped in the river.}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{i jumped in the river to save you so i could get my wings.}
<A>__{nick stops pouring the drinks, bottle poised in his hand.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{oh, that's right.}
<A>__{a cash register bell rings off stage. clarence reacts to the sound of the bell.}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{oh oh. somebody's just made it.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{made what?}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings.}
<A>__{george glances up at nick.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{look, i think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{why? don't they believe in angels?}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(looking at nick)}
<D>__{a... yeah, but... you know...}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{then why should they be surprised when they see one?}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(to nick)}
<D>__{he never grew up. he's...}
<P>__{(to clarence)}
<D>__{how old are you, anyway, clarence?}
<C>__{clarence}
<D>__{two hundred and ninety three...}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{...next may.}
<A>__{nick slams the bottle down on the counter.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{that does it! out you two pixies go, through the door or out the window!}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{look, nick. what's wrong?}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{and that's another thing. where do you come off calling me nick?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{well, nick, that's your name, isn't it?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what's that got to do with it? i don't know you from adam's off ox.}
<P>__{(sees someone come in)}
<D>__{hey, you! rummy! come here! come here!}
<B>__{close shot}
<A>__{a small wreck of a man, with weak, watery eyes. obviously a broken down panhandler, his hat in his hand.}
<B>__{closeup george}
<A>__{he can hardly believe his eyes. it is gower the druggist.}
<B>__{back to shot nick at the bar}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(to gower)}
<D>__{didn't i tell you never to come panhandling around here?}
<A>__{nick picks up a seltzer bottle, and squirts gower in the face with it. the crowd laugh brutally. gower smiles weakly as the soda runs off his face.}
<B>__{close shot}
<A>__{george, horrified, leaps up and goes over to gower.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{mr. gower! mr. gower! this is george bailey! don't you know me?}
<C>__{gower}
<D>__{no. no.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(to his bouncers)}
<D>__{throw him out. throw him out.}
<A>__{the bouncers throw gower out the front door. george rushes back to the bar.}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(bewildered)}
<D>__{hey, what is... hey, nick, nick... isn't that mr. gower, the druggist?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you know, that's another reason for me not to like you. that rumhead spent twenty years in jail for poisoning a kid. if you know him, you must be a jailbird yourself.}
<P>__{(to his bouncers)}
<D>__{would you show these gentlemen to the door.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{sure. this way, gentlemen.}
