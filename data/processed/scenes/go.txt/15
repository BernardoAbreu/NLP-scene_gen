<L>__{interior mannie's car parking lot night}
<A>__{the beast is mannie's pride and joy, a late 70's toyota held together with duct tape and prayer. it's outfitted for the season with christmas lights lining the windshield and back window. santa has replaced jesus on the dashboard. ronna climbs in the passenger door, counting a stack of 20's fresh from the atm. claire's in back.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{you know that simon's in vegas.}
<C>__{ronna}
<D>__{i don't need simon. i'm going to todd.}
<C>__{mannie}
<D>__{todd gaines?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{who's todd gaines?}
<C>__{mannie}
<D>__{simon's dealer.}
<A>__{claire sits forward in the seat, suddenly worried.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{you can't do that, can you? i mean, go around simon.}
<A>__{she looks at mannie. he shrugs, unsure.}
<C>__{ronna}
<D>__{ok, listen up. if simon were here which he's not he would charge fifteen, when i know he gets it for ten.}
<C>__{ronna }
<D>__{times twenty hits, that's a hundred bucks i'd be pissing out my dick.}
<C>__{mannie}
<D>__{but it's like an evolutionary leap. you're moving up the drug food chain. without permission.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{ronna, you shouldn't do this.}
<A>__{ronna pockets the cash. mannie's about to say something when she stops him.}
<C>__{ronna}
<D>__{both of you chill the fuck out. it's just once. when simon gets back, we can still overpay for quarters if it makes you feel all warm and happy. but this is my deal, so just sit back and watch.}
<A>__{mannie and claire remain unconvinced. ronna reaches for the keys, cranking the ignition even though mannie's driving. the engine purrs.}
<C>__{ronna }
<D>__{besides, todd likes me. this won't be any problem.}
<A>__{a buzzer sounds.}
