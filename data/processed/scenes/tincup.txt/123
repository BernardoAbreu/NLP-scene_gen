<A>__{whoas! from the barside gallery. tin cup rises and someone hands him a club. suddenly there's a crowd, including gary mccord who's been watching from the far end of the bar. he grabs a seltzer hose as if it's a mike and begins announcing.}
<D>__{mccord ... he's looking at thirty yards of bar and grill, an opening through the french doors, forty yards of patio umbrellas, a hundred yards of water, and a lonely pelican sitting out there in a 15 mile an hour breeze, south by southwest...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he'll probably try to shut down a four iron no, he's selected his trusty seven iron...}
<A>__{tin cup steps up to a ball lying on the carpet.}

<C>__{simms}
<D>__{beats all that deep rough you were in today...}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{fore in the grill! fore on the patio! you're the legend, boss...}

<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{what is this all about?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{shut up and hit the ball. mccord}
<P>__{(on "mike")}
<D>__{the ledge still has to be thinking about that brutal, ego sapping, manhood robbing eighty three he buried himself under yesterday. i mean, that's just an avalanche of golf swings, a landslide, a pyroclastic flow }
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{dollar bills...}
<A>__{and he swings the ball rockets through the hall and clears the open door... the bettors pile from the bar and grill and race to the patio to watch the flight of the ball, as it's carrying, it's hooking, it's carrying, then: thwack! it hits the piling! the seagull lifts off, screeching angrily.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{stiff, baby, stiff!}
