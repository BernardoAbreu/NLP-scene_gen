<L>__{interior viewing room police station night}
<A>__{gale and dewey stand, gazing through the two way mirror. roman can't see them. they watch nervously.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{they found another note?}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{uh huh. another news clipping. another one about sid's mom. dewey, whether we like it or not it looks like we're going to have to go back into our past.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{you mean our past as in me and sid. this has nothing to do with you gale.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{this has everything to do with me dewey. i was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. i will be damned if i'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{do you really mean it this time gale?}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{yes. look, let's get something straight dewey, i got into this shit cause the police came looking for me. not cause i'm out to make the sunrise studios slashings.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{why would the police come to you?}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{again, i am the author of the definitive book on the woodsboro murders.!}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{what about you?}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{what about me?}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{you said you'd never leave woodsboro, 'the only place that's real!' but now you're here. not with me. dewey, i took care of you. i waited until you were well. i couldn't stay there, i mean, it's like dog years, one year in woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{so it's off to london for a week? new york for a month? l.a forever?}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{it was fucking '60 minutes ii'! i couldn't say no! i could've been the next diane sawyer!}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{what's wrong with just being gale weathers? i liked her!}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{it didn't work dewey. we tried, we're different.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{you used to say that was our strength.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate k mart, straight to video version of me, are you?}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{brace yourself, gale, all of this is actually not about you.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{all of what dewey? you do know something, don't you?}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{off the record.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{always.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{two months ago, the woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'stab 3'. she wanted to see the file on sid, for research.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{and?}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{the boys said no. she wouldn't give her name. a month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{someone stole sid's file?}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{i already removed it. i think someone on the film was trying to find sid, and that's the only reason i came here. to make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.}
<C>__{gale}
<P>__{(whips out cellular)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, this is too good!}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{what part of 'off the record' don't you understand?}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{right. sorry.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{do you think he did it?}
<P>__{(re: roman)}
<C>__{dewey}
<P>__{(his beeper goes off)}
<D>__{i've got my suspicions but still, nothing you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{and who is that?}
<A>__{but dewey doesn't answer. again, he's staring daggers through gale. years and years of bottled up resentment is finally surfacing.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{jennifer needs me.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{jennifer?! wait, where are you going off to?}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{i'm on duty.}
<A>__{dewey races out the room. gale pauses, stares at the interrogation. wallace has reduced roman to tears. it's pathetic. gale bolts after dewey.}
