<A>__{she comes in. looks at herself in the mirror. suddenly feels self conscious. she grabs a bathrobe off the door.}

<A>__{foley lies there, fiddling with the zippo, staring up at the ceiling. she comes out again and stands looking down at him.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i want you to know something. i wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{why are you mad?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{or i did it for some kind of kinky thrill. score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{what about my motive? now i can say i fucked a us marshal. you think i will?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{he raises the covers, but she just stands there.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i know of a guy he goes in the bank holding a bottle he says is nitroglycerin. he scores some cash off a teller, he's on his way out when he drops the bottle. it shatters on the tile floor, he slips in the stuff, cracks his head and they've got him. the nitro was canola oil. i know more fucked up bank robbers than ones that know what they're doing. i doubt one in ten can tell a dye pack when he sees one. most bank robbers are fucking morons. to go to bed with a bank robber for kinky thrills, as you say, you'd have to be as dumb as they are. i know you're not dumb, so why would i think that? why would you think i might think that?}
<A>__{she comes over and sits down on the bed.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you're not dumb.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i don't know about that. you can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.}
<A>__{they lie there for a few moments, karen watching him. he senses this, looks at her...}
<C>__{foley }
<D>__{you getting serious on me now?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i'm trying not to. i just wanna know what's gonna happen.}
<C>__{foley}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you know.}
<A>__{and he kisses her.}
