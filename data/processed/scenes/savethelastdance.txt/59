<L>__{interior feetz entrance same time}
<A>__{patrick and malakai enter with two high school dropouts we will learn are arvel and lip. females flock to flirt with patrick and malakai, who both swell like sponges, soaking up the attention.}
<L>__{interior feetz bar same time}
<A>__{chenille pushes her way to the bar, tugging sara along. a tall, angular twenty something man on the far side of the bar sees her. she sees him. sucks her teeth, nudges sara.}
<C>__{chenille}
<D>__{that's him. comin' over. kenny? don't look.}
<A>__{so of course sara does. she makes a silly face at chenille as kenny sidles up to her. chenille rolls her eyes half heartedly.}
<C>__{kenny }
<D>__{what's up?}
<C>__{chenille}
<D>__{where's my money, kenny?}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{i'm a little short this week. don't jump off. it's comin'.}
<C>__{chenille}
<D>__{it's comin'? no. you lyin'.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{lemme rap to you about the situation on the dance floor.}
<A>__{she shakes her head firmly but her eyes do tell. she's in love with him. enough to let him whisper in her ear, sweet talk her away from the bar. before she's swallowed up by the crowd, chenille turns back to sara, shouts:}
<C>__{chenille}
<D>__{rum and coke. no ice. hook me up.}
<B>__{on patrick}
<A>__{splitting off from malakai and a girl clinging to him. he's walking through when nikki appears from nowhere, grabs his arm.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{let's dance.}
<C>__{patrick}
<P>__{(pulling away)}
<D>__{let's not.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{oh? it's gonna be like that.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{how'd you think it was gonna be? that you was gonna drop me and pick me up whenever you felt like it?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{it ain't all that serious, patrick.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{it ain't anymore, nikki. not to me.}
<A>__{he walks off. camera tracks him going deep inside the club. he wants a drink. he's almost at the bar when he sees chenille on the dance floor with kenny. she shrugs a smile, then cocks her head over at the bar. toward sara. the look is like, help me out. don't let me leave her hangin'. patrick rolls his eyes as he glances at sara, before he really sees her. she looks fly. hugely fly. he ambles up as she shouts into the bartender's ear.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{rum and coke, straight up. and a beer. i don't care. anything.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{bad choice. 'anything.'}
<A>__{the closeness of his voice startles her. she turns into his smile. that cocksure, leave'em weak in the knees smile.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{it's just a beer.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{then it should be the best beer. you'd know that if you really drank.}
<A>__{sara's knees straighten, her spine stiffens. the asshole's back.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{whatever.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{what's that mean? whatever.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{whatever you want it to mean. you're the whiz kid, right? you know everything.}
<C>__{patrick}
<P>__{(chuckles at this, at her)}
<D>__{not everything. like i don't know why we're standin' still.}
<P>__{(closer with a teasing whisper)}
<D>__{i'm supposed to be dizzy by now. remember? from all those circles you danced around me.}
<A>__{sara leans against the bar. the knees are going again.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i don't feel like dancing.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{but you do know how...?}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{would i be here if i didn't?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{... let's do it then. c'mon.}
<A>__{he coaxes her onto the dance floor. parliament's funk classic "flashlight" is playing. the dance crowd is robustly singing the refrain to the song. there's a party on the floor. favor sara and patrick, facing each other. he's moving already. she starts to dance, stiffly, tentatively. patrick smiles at her. shakes his head. he grabs her hands, swings them in time to the music.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{now move your hips. not so fast.}
<P>__{(as sara looks lost)}
<D>__{sara! just like our hands.}
<P>__{(singing, in sync with the crowd)}
<D>__{'flashlight! neon light! stop light! everybody got a little light under the sun.'}
<A>__{the music's beginning to feel good to sara. patrick lets go of her hands. starts to dance. sara watches him intensely, her body follows his stiffly. patrick's a good teacher. he leads without leaving her. whenever she misses a complicated move, he smoothly segues into another less complicated one. sara begins to pick up on patrick's rhythm. her eyes never wander from his. and then she starts to feel something else. they both do. a rising beat. a quickening heart. and not from the dancing. she smiles bashfully at him. patrick suddenly grabs her around the waist, pulls her to him in a sexy spoon dance. all sara can do is try to keep up and hang on.}
<B>__{from another angle}
<A>__{nikki avidly watching sara and patrick with jasmin and tiff'ny.}
<C>__{jasmin}
<D>__{she's all up in your nut, nikki... oh, that's right. it ain't your nut anymore.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{it is if i want it to be. he is if i want him to be. that bitch ain't got shit on me.}
<A>__{the girls regard her in conspicuous, dubious silence. nikki maintains her cool but inside her pride is pricking.}
