<D>__{nikolai's black mercedes pulls up outside the restaurant and parks a few inches from anna's motorbike. the rear windows are sun shaded so we only see nikolai in the driver's seat. he gets out of the car and opens the rear door of the car for an elegantly dressed turkish lady in her fifties. nikolai goes to the other rear door. the portly figure of ozim the barber emerges. as ozim gets out he gives nikolai a fifty pound note.}
