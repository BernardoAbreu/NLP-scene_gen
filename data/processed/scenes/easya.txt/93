<L>__{interior guidance office continuous}
<A>__{mrs. griffin has just hung up on her teenage lover and begins freaking out. she grabs a cardboard box and begins throwing items into it. olive bursts into mrs. griffin's office and sees mrs. griffin packing her things. as we saw before }
<C>__{mrs. griffin}
<P>__{(snapping)}
<D>__{what?! what do you want?}
<A>__{olive starts to say something, but mrs. griffin can't even look at her.}
<C>__{mrs. griffin }
<D>__{just go!}
<A>__{she throws a framed photo of her and mr. griffin into the box. it shatters. mrs. griffin falls apart. olive starts to say something again, but she doesn't know what to say, so she sheepishly turns to leave and then feels awkward.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i was just looking for marianne. did she say something about being mad at me? she just smacked the shi `crap' out of me.}
<A>__{this makes mrs. griffin cry even harder. she attempts to pull herself together.}
<C>__{mrs. griffin}
<D>__{it's my fault. i'm so sorry, olive.}
<A>__{olive looks at her, quizzically.}
<C>__{mrs. griffin }
<P>__{(sotto voce)}
<D>__{i fucked up. i fucking fucked up so fucking bad. i'm a fucking.... fuck.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{don't get me wrong. i love it, but i don't think you're supposed to use those words around a student.}
<C>__{mrs. griffin}
<D>__{yeah, well, you're not to supposed to fuck them, either. but it didn't stop me.}
<A>__{olive puts two and two together in her head. she gasps a little louder than she planned.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{you and oh my god. i'm not judging you or anything, but oh my god.}
<P>__{(switching gears)}
<D>__{wait. what does that have to do with me?}
<A>__{mrs. griffin walks over and locks her office door. she fights back more tears, as she tries to explain to olive.}
<D>__{olive (v.o.) (cont'd) my guidance counselor, who had only days before armed me with a latex bulletproof vest, told me that she had chlamydia and that she had been screwing around with her office aide's boyfriend under the guise of divorce counseling. she confided in me that she and her husband my favorite teacher were having marital problems, that they hadn't slept together in months. she assured me that she had never meant for anything to happen with micah. she confessed to me how when she was a child she always dreamt of being maria von trapp, not mary kay letorneau. micah had panicked and used me as a scapegoat to save her job and her marriage. she assured me that she would make sure everyone knew the truth and apologized.}
<A>__{mrs. griffin stops talking and waits for olive to speak.}
<D>__{olive (v.o.) (cont'd) and i bought it.}
<A>__{olive gives her a reassuring smile, steps up to the plate and offers up a solution.}
<C>__{olive }
<D>__{i could have chlamydia. and i could easily have given it to micah. that time we slept together. who knows? often times women don't have symptoms and i have been whoring around....}
<C>__{mrs. griffin}
<D>__{no you haven't.}
<A>__{olive looks at her, puzzled by her knowledge.}
<C>__{mrs. griffin }
<P>__{(looking away)}
<D>__{because a real whore can't admit it to herself, let alone others.}
<A>__{she begins to weep. olive puts her hand on mrs. griffin's shoulder.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{call micah. tell him i said he's an asshole and that he owes me so big for this and also the time i pretended not to see him during a third grade game of hide and seek. tell him i still remember that. but tell him that i confessed to giving him chlamydia.}
<A>__{mrs. griffin grabs olive and cries on her.}
<C>__{olive }
<D>__{and it's not really my place to say this, but i figure after the conversation we just had, i can speak candidly. your husband is hot and while the male adolescent can fuck like a bunny... who really wants to fuck a bunny? if i was you, i'd go home and seduce him and pretend this never happened.}
<A>__{olive strokes her guidance counselor's hair.}
<C>__{mrs. griffin}
<P>__{(sniveling)}
<D>__{do you want some more condoms?}
<C>__{olive}
<P>__{(maternally)}
<D>__{no, you keep them.}
<A>__{she strokes her hair.}
