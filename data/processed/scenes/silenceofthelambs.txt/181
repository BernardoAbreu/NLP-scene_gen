<A>__{ the low throb of a washing machine...}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior laundry room academy dorm night (very late)}
<A>__{clarice has spread out the case file across two washing machines. ardelia, cross legged on a dryer, studies another pile of forms. nearby is their laundry basket, detergent box.}
<C>__{ardelia}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{hey, is this lecter's handwriting? she holds up the map, with its location markings for the kidnapping and body dump sites. clarice takes it, looks.}
<A>__{insert the map with newly inked words in dr. lecter's precise, elegant hand.}
<C>__{dr. lecter }
<D>__{clarice, doesn't this random scattering of sites seem overdone to you? doesn't it seem desperately random like the elaborations of a bad liar? ta... hannibal lecter.}
<A>__{new angle two shot as clarice looks up at ardelia, puzzled but excited.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{"desperately random." what does he mean?}
<C>__{ardelia}
<D>__{not random at all, maybe. like there's some pattern here...?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{but there is no pattern. there's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! they're even found in random order.}
<C>__{ardelia}
<D>__{well, except for the one girl.}
<C>__{clarice}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what girl?}
<C>__{ardelia}
<D>__{the one that was weighted down. where is she...? fred something.}
<A>__{they search among the inserts. clarice finds the graduation photo.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{fredrica bimmel, from belvedere, ohio. the first girl taken, but the third body found... why?}
<C>__{ardelia}
<D>__{'cause she didn't drift. he weighted her down.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{but why? he didn't weight the others.}
<A>__{clarice moves, on fire, unable to keep still.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{the first, what the hell did lecter say about... "first principles," he said. simplicity... what does this guy do, he "covets." how do we first start to covet? "we covet what we see "}
<A>__{she stops, turns. she grabs the photo of fredrica from ardelia, stares at it. she looks up, trembling.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{" every day."}
<C>__{ardelia}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{hot damn, clarice.}
<C>__{clarice }
<D>__{he knew her...!}
