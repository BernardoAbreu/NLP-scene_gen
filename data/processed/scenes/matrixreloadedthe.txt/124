<L>__{exterior alley (matrix) day}
<A>__{the sky and matrix are still frozen. trinity and choi make their way along cautiously, leapfrogging from cover to cover. they pause behind a dumpster, and just before looking out, theres the sound of metal tapping metal, twice. trinity looks in the direction of the sound. morpheus and niobe are standing still in the shadows, near the end of the alley. trinity and choi make their way to them. trinity peeks cautiously around the edge. on the other side of the street is a phone booth.}

<C>__{choi}
<D>__{too quiet? the world is frozen. ill go first. no one likes the idea.}
<A>__{real time suddenly returns. the lightning bolts in the sky suddenly re animate, thundering out of existence, making the four of them jump out of their skulls. the sounds of the city suddenly flood back. on the street, people stir to their feet. everyone is confused as to what happened.}
