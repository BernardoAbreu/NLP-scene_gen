<L>__{exterior cemetery n night}

<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{there we are. now if i stand here...}
<A>__{he positions himself at one end of the grave.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{... and you stand there, not too far away and you shoot me, i should fall straight back into the hole.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{you don't think i have the guts to do this do you?}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{i'm hoping you do.}
<A>__{mr. brooks shuts off his light and straightens up.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{okay, let's get this over with.}
<A>__{mr. smith raises his gun and points it at mr. brooks's head. he hesitates.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{i will close my eyes.}
<A>__{he does. mr. smith pulls the trigger. click! mr. smith looks in horror at the malfunctioning gun. mr. brooks opens his eyes. mr. smith aims the gun again. click!... click!}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{as he talks he counters around until mr. smith is the one with his back to the open grave.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{i really did want you to kill me. but in case at the last minute i changed my mind, i returned to your apartment and bent the firing pin on your gun.}
<A>__{he wrenches the shovel out of a mound of waiting earth. mr. smith tries to fire the gun at mr. brooks again. click!... click!}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{in fact i even brought another gun for you so you could finish me if i had decided to go through with it.}
<A>__{he opens his jacket and shows mr. smith the gun.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{unfortunately for you, my daughter is pregnant and just before you pulled the trigger, i realized how much i want to see the end to that story.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<P>__{(dry mouth)}
<D>__{if you do anything to me, if you touch one hair on my head, the police will find the pictures of you killing that couple.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{the contents of your safety deposit box, mr. smith, have vanished.}
<A>__{without warning, mr. brooks swings the shovel. the force of the blow breaks mr. smith's left arm. he howls. the next blow comes almost immediately. it smashes into the left side of mr. smith's head. the screams stop and a misfiring set of neurons causes mr. smith to stand up straight and wobbling, look directly at mr. brooks. the blood streaming down his face is black in the moonlight. mr. brooks takes a step to the side, cocks his wrists and swings again. his full weight is behind this one. the blade of the shovel strikes mr. smith in the throat very nearly taking off his head. the flesh that was once mr. smith falls to the ground.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<P>__{(looking down at the corpse)}
<D>__{before i was the thumbprint killer, mr. smith, i killed a lot of people in a lot of different ways.}
