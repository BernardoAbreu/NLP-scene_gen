<A>__{mr. brooks removes his shoes and leaves them on the plastic, then slips his feet into paper slippers. with handiwipes he wipes down the outside of the passenger door, in fact anything on that side mr. smith could have touched. he opens the door and wipes down the seat and the dash and the console. back on the plastic, mr. brooks undresses. on top of his clothes he drops the used handiwipes, the slippers and the vacuum bag. the corners of the plastic sheet are folded up, twisted together and zip tied to create a nice neat package which mr. brooks picks up and takes into the ceramics studio.}
