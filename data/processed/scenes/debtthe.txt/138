<L>__{interior newspaper office main room. continuous.}
<A>__{rachel is still at the desk reading. suddenly the main lights are switched on and the receptionist and the boyfriend stagger into sight. rachel stands frozen, completely visible. the girl and boyfriend stand kissing, too engrossed in each other to see the woman standing only ten feet from them. the receptionist pulls free, laughing, makes it back to the entrance and switches the lights off, plunging the room into darkness. rachel moves behind a column. laughing softly, the boyfriend leads the girl over to a desk. he opens a drawer, searches through it, triumphantly produces a petty cash tin.}
<C>__{boyfriend}
<D>__{the loot!}
<A>__{he starts to take some cash from the box.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{you can't!}

<D>__{i will put in an i o u...}
<A>__{he scribbles on a piece of paper.}
<C>__{boyfriend }
<D>__{"andrei borrowed money to take katia to club oxygen."}
<A>__{he drops the note in the tin.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{you're going to get fired.}

<C>__{boyfriend}
<D>__{you're worth it.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{you're going to get me fired!}
<C>__{boyfriend}
<P>__{(kissing her)}
<D>__{i'm worth it.}
<A>__{they kiss again, slowly backing up against the desk rachel was searching. the two struggle with their clothes.}
<B>__{behind the column}
<A>__{rachel has no way of reaching the door. she closes her eyes as the young couple begin to have sex on the desk. then she opens her eyes and notices something... rachel's p.o.v close on her torch which is still on the desk. the boyfriend seems to be staring right at it. rachel watches, holding her breath.}
<B>__{on boyfriend}
<A>__{...as we realise he is staring straight through the torch, lost in the moment. next moment the couple change positions and some books and the torch are swept from the desk and clatter to the floor. the torch rolls across the carpet to the shadowy entrance of the cubicle.}
<B>__{behind the column}
<A>__{rachel stares at the torch, wondering if she can reach it before they can see her. but at the moment the desktop tryst reaches its noisy conclusion.}
<B>__{at the desk}
<A>__{the boyfriend does up his trousers and pulls on his coat. the receptionist adjusts her dress. she notices the fallen items and begins to pick them up, following the trail to the torch.}
<B>__{behind the column}
<A>__{rachel stands frozen as the receptionist stoops down directly in front of her and picks up the torch. the boyfriend notices.}
<C>__{boyfriend}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{i'm tidying up.}
<C>__{boyfriend}
<D>__{are you working? are you at work now?}
<C>__{receptionist}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{no, i'm not working.}
<C>__{boyfriend}
<D>__{so leave them.}
<A>__{she drops the objects and follows her boyfriend out. shaking, rachel picks up her torch and replaces the items she is still holding from yuri's file into the filing cabinet. from os, we hear the beep beep beep of the alarm being reset. rachel's heart sinks. os, we hear office doors close, and the key turning in the lock. rachel's eyes alight on a motion sensor, blinking in the corner of the room. she waits. and eventually no choice she runs for the door. the motion sensor lights up and the alarm strikes up loudly with a warning beep beep beep.}
