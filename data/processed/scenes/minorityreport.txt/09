<L>__{interior kitchen later}
<A>__{checkered linoleum floor. appliances out of the 1950's. except there are little differences. when lisa puts a skillet of eggs on the stove, the heating element is not an electric coil, or gas but a shimmering field of light. lisa is dressed in a blue jersey skirt and a brief jacket. anderson wears a gray suit, thin blue tie, white shirt, wingtipped shoes. he doesn't look up from the newspaper as he speaks.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{who called?}
<A>__{lisa keeps her back to him as she flips the eggs. she touches her long brown hair.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{no one. i called about my hair. getting it done this afternoon.}
<A>__{anderson looks like he's about to say something else, when suddenly someone raps on the back screen door. anderson and lisa both turn and smile.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{come on in, neighbor. want some coffee?}
<B>__{outside the door}
<A>__{frank d'ignazio, 65, white haired, robust, hesitates before coming in. a thin metallic arm with a red laser light arches quickly down from above the doorway, shines into each of his eyes, scanning the irises. the arm lifts out of view, the screen door unlatches. frank enters the kitchen, carrying a basket of tomatoes.}
<C>__{frank d'ignazio}
<D>__{brought these for your supper.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{oh, frank. that's so sweet. thank you.}
<C>__{frank d'ignazio}
<D>__{sweet, nothing. i gotta get rid of these things. one plant, and i'm invaded by tomatoes. when i was a kid ...}
<A>__{anderson laughs, claps his friend and neighbor on the back, teases him.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{before all this genetically engineered crap ...}
<A>__{frank gives him an ornery look, then a smile.}
<C>__{frank d'ignazio}
<D>__{yeah well, it's true. it used to be a challenge to grow things. an art. now you put one plant in the ground then jump the hell out of the way.}
<A>__{anderson gestures for frank to sit down.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{coffee?}
<C>__{frank d'ignazio}
<D>__{nah, thanks. can't stay. you guys are rushing off to work anyway.}
<A>__{lisa sets the eggs down in front of anderson.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{you and ellie come for supper then.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{we'll barbecue.}
<A>__{frank nods and pushes on the screen door.}
<C>__{frank d'ignazio}
<D>__{you betcha. we'll bring some more tomatoes a new batch will have grown by then.}
<A>__{they all laugh, frank exits, anderson goes back to his paper.}
