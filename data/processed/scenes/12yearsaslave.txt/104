<L>__{interior epps's plantation slave shack day}
<A>__{solomon takes the slip of paper and hides it within his fiddle. perhaps the safest place he can think of. he acts as though he's hiding away found gold. in reality it's more than that. for solomon the paper is a first step toward freedom.}
<L>__{interior master epps's plantation main house night}
<A>__{ december, 1844 it's another night of epps's forced revelry. coming in quick from the previous scene, we go from solomon holding his fiddle, to playing it as the slaves are again made to dance. mistress epps brings out a tray of freshly baked pastries. she sets them down on a table.}
<C>__{mistress epps}
<D>__{a moment from the dancing. come sample what i baked for y'all.}
<A>__{the slaves, thankful for the rest as much as the food, file toward the tray reciting a chorus of "thank you, mistress." as patsey moves toward the pastries:}
<C>__{mistress epps }
<D>__{there'll be none for you, patsey.}
<A>__{patsey merely turns away. her non responsiveness, however, serves only to incite the mistress. screaming:}
<C>__{mistress epps }
<D>__{yah see that? did yah see the look of insolence she give me?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{seen nothin' but her turn away.}
<C>__{mistress epps}
<D>__{are you blind or ignorant? it was hot, hateful scorn. it filled that black face. yah tell me yah did'n see it, then yah choose not to look, or yah sayin' i lie.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{whatever it was, it passed.}
<C>__{mistress epps}
<D>__{is that how yah are with the niggers? let every ill thought fester inside 'em. look at 'em}
<C>__{mistress epps }
<D>__{they foul with it; foul with their hate. you let it be, it'll come back to us in the dark a night. yah want that? yah want them black animals to leave us gut like pigs in our own sleep?}
<A>__{epps isn't sure how to respond to the inchoate berating. it's an invitation for the mistress to continue.}
<C>__{mistress epps }
<D>__{you are manless. a damned eunuch if ever there was. and if yah won't stand for me, i'd pray you'd at least be a credit to yer own kind and beat every foul thought from 'em.}
<A>__{epps does nothing. the mistress lets her anger loose. she moves quickly to patsey, drives her nails into the patsey's face and draws them down across her features. five deep and bloody gashes are left in patsey's skin, the moment marked with appropriate screams. patsey collapses on the floor, covering her bleeding face.}
<C>__{mistress epps }
<D>__{beat it from 'em!}
<A>__{thoroughly cuckolded by the mistress's actions, epps takes his whip and pulls patsey out of the house. his intentions are plain. all the slaves remain silent. the mistress, however, displaying high satisfaction, entreats the others:}
<C>__{mistress epps }
<D>__{eat. fill yourselves. ...and then we dance.}
<A>__{the slaves eat, but without a hint of levity.}
