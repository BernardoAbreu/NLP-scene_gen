<A>__{the van sits parked down the road from maggie's dimly lit home. ray sits behind the wheel, watching the house. locusts make a steady and unnerving sound. it is black. black under big sky. ray lets his head sag out the open window and he takes in the vastness. pov: stars. millions of stars. and an incredible full moon. it hangs huge over distant fields, a perfect sphere. the top half of the moon is yellow, the bottom half a lava red. reverse ray stares at it, lost in thought. from maggie's house, he hears someone singing. singing a traditional sundance song while they haul water from the creek. a woman's voice, trilling out the beautiful but haunting "hey o hey o hey o hey ohhhhh." ray just sits, listening. and then something draws his attention to his rearview mirror. the res dog, lying in the back seat is growling. lip curled back, growling low. ray looks at him, looks out the window. blackness. nothing but the sound of locusts. and a slight crosswind in the wheat fields. the dog stops growling. and ray fixes his gaze on the house again, lifting a pair of binoculars and boooooom! the rear windshield is shattered by an explosion. ray throws himself low across the passenger seat booooom! the driver's side window and part of the door explodes. res road near eagle bear's the federal van is hammered by gunfire. all the windows, shattered, the metal doors splayed. someone is going for the kill,}
