<A>__{ronna and claire stare at each other, a competition, neither wanting to exhale first. hands waving, claire struggles to keep herself from laughing and choking. finally she gives in, coughing up smoke and snot. ronna blows out a cool ribbon of smoke. she hands over a wreath of plastic holly.}
<C>__{ronna}
<D>__{pin me.}
<A>__{she leans down to let claire pin the holly in a crown around and through her hair.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{okay, at the risk of sounding like. you know. me. what are you going to do about getting evicted? you're still short, aren't you?}
<A>__{mannie's hand flops down to the window. claire hands him the jointerior from ronna's p.o.v., we see the floor is still littered with dozens of boxes of medicine. a beat. she picks up a box. an idea forming, ronna sits back up. smiles.}
