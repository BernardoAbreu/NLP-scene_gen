<A>__{randy sits on his bed, sifting through a messy, junk filled shoebox. he pulls out an old photo. randy's pov: it's a mid '80s photo of randy and his infant daughter stephanie in front of the family christmas tree. randy, wearing a santa cap, is smiling and laughing, stephanie perched on his huge, steroid pumped bicep. he flips the photo over. on the back are a bunch of scribbled phone numbers. they're all crossed out except the last one. the numbers get progressively more faded from bottom to top, as if they've been written down over the course of years.}
