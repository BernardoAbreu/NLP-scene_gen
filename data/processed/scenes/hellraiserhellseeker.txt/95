<A>__{it's a long ride down. nobody speaks. trevor looks at the cops in the sunglasses. one of them takes his pair off. his eye sockets are empty. we can see brain. the cop cleans his shades then his mouth smiles at trevor before he puts the sunglasses back on. finally the doors open. lange unlocks trevor's handcuffs and the cops push him out the door into a dark corridor.}
