<A>__{as the camera examines air bubbles and crystalline patterns. moving up and over this amber abstraction, the camera finds unusual shapes and imperfections caught in the glassy stone: flecks of dirt, hairs, cracks. still moving. starbursts of light ricochet off the different surfaces of the stones. camera turns along a creamy stretch of amber. it turns in deeper, abstracting the picture further only to find a tiny blur that suddenly racks into focus a bug, a mosquito lodged within an amber tomb. it is folded on its back.}

<A>__{as the tip of a fine pointed drill bores into the amber toward the trapped bug. orange flecks fly. the mosquito trembles. the drill continues, stopping just before it touches the tiny body. a shiny pair of thin needle nose pliers reach in the borehole and extricate the mosquito remains. these are dropped on a brightly lit glass slide. a conveyor belt starts, and the slide moves along. arriving under a long lensed microscope. in microscopic perspective, a thin needle pierces the bug and delicately removes a fragment of tissue. pincers snare the fragment, dropping it into a narrow tube. the tube spins, faster and faster until it is a blur on the screen. the screen floods with an infra red light. gray, oval shapes rock in a neutral mist.}

<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{well, i don't disregard method. but think of mutation which is nothing more than sloppy communication on the cellular level. think how triumphant mutations have been in natural selection. oh, but i know what you're saying. it's true that i have never been afraid to make money with science. i've always considered profit to be a measure of success, a barometer of public reaction.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{mr. hammond, the essential truth of a scientific law ha}

<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{right. you are witnessing the extraction of tissue from the thorax of this humble insect. if this mosquito has ingested any foreign red blood cells say it bit a hadrosaur or a stegosaurus or a t rex we will extract those blood cells and obtain paleo dna, the how to build instruction book of an extinct creature. so you see, ellie, i'm not creating dino saurs. fossils left behind the information, the map of how to bring them back. i'm helping them escape from the confined of time.}

<C>__{grant}
<D>__{looks pretty calm.}
<A>__{thump. the raft stops moving. they are aground. lex looks overboard. she reaches in about elbow deep. grant stands and puts the oars in the water. he pushes with all his might. there is a long scraping sound of the raft against the mud floor. but it moves. and the raft goes into deep enough water. a general sigh of relief as they gently float downstream. a wide area of the river grant energetically works the oars. close on lex lets her hand trail in the water.}

<D>__{i will row, dr. grant.}
<C>__{grant}

<A>__{white foam crashes on the raft and sprays the kids. they burst out laughing. grant smiles at them, but there is concern in his eyes. another bend now the raft is really racing. the kids hold on tightly as the raft is rocked. white water crashed over, drenching the kids. when grant takes a moment to look, he is soaked by a huge wave. the raft tosses right and left. timmy holds the rubber grips. he's yanked to one side. he's knocked to the raft floor. quickly gets his grip again. shouts to grant.}

<A>__{grant is unimpressed. he holds a hand out to hammond. hammond tries a new approach.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{don't you see i've exalted human potential here? you must see it. you must feel it. i called back a life form. listen, dr. grant, don't go. be a part of this. i'm inviting you to do just that let the others go, if they want.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{you interrupted natural law. there are regulations,}
<A>__{rules that nature follows}
<D>__{that make her knowable.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{you mean there are rules that nature follows that create barriers to our knowledge.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{barriers? like the seasons? the earth spinning, orbiting the sun? the entire solar system in interlocking motion. our own beings in biological step with it all. mr. hammond, you've disrupted the pattern and look what it's done!}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{i know what it's done. i've made triceratops and gallimimus and a t rex. i've got a batch of iguanadons being born on tuesday. what do you say to that?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{don't count on it. now get in.}
<A>__{grant jumps in the copter, holds out a hand to hammond.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{you created mutant forms that you further mutated to create amus}
<A>__{ement attractions.}
<D>__{you made biological puppets with heartbeats and an early death sentence.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{i created genetic miracles!}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{you created a park to generate a profit making merchandising operation.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{the merchandise is just a by product. souvenirs for people to reflect on the wonder. you fainted when you saw the brachiosaur. alan, look, let's not argue. the problem is that my employees were not up to par with my dream. they failed me. the park, i promise you, is safe. it really is.}
<A>__{grant grabs hammond's arm, starts to tug.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{you park is doomed. now come with me.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{it is not! it's blooming! in the throes of labor! you are one more more negative voice in a}
<A>__{universe of negativity.}
<D>__{you'll amount to nothing. you'll be a bone brusher all your life. i pity you.}
<A>__{hammond pulls his arm away and strides away from the helicopter just as the rotors start up. hammond's suit whips in the wind. grant calls to him, reaching out his arm.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{come back, mr. hammond! it's over!}
<A>__{hammond keeps walking. he disappears over a grassy knoll. grant's outstretched hand drops to his side when the attack comes. with a huge bellow, the t rex comes charging at the helicopter. the pilot screams for all to board as he starts to lift off. the rex bites onto the copter skid as the copter tries to escape. the copter angles dangerously as the rex holds on. ellie fires a fire extinguisher into the furious face of the rex and its jaws relax. the copter escapes and starts to climb high into the sky. the rex paws after it, then drops down to four legs and gives the copter a final swipe with its tail. the tail swishes through the air and cracks against the plexiglass windshield which fissures and pops. the pilot struggles to maintain altitude and manages to keep the craft in the air. with a roar of its own, the copter breaks into the blue sky and soars. away, leaving an angry t rex alone. unnoticed by the frustrated rex, hammond slips away and walks into the jungle. in the copter slowly pan the exhausted faces of muldoon and his workers, lex and timmy holding onto each other, and grant huddles next to ellie. he reaches out and puts an arm around her shoulder. she reaches up and pulls his arm close.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{they're so beautiful. they're condemned, aren't they? even those embryo fragments had the same viral contamination.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{i have a theory.}
<A>__{ellie looks up in surprise. she give him a big smile.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{you have a theory?}
<A>__{grant smiles back at her.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{i think that they could never completely isolate the dinosaur dna. there was always some microscopic mosquito contamination. but at the molecular level, that was enough. every dinosaur received the same genetic massage, the encoding that every mosquito gets to terminate life after a season.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{so the very process itself was flawed.}
<A>__{she's sad. grant hugs her. over her shoulder he gives a parting glance to the island. a green jewel in a blue sea. suddenly it is obliterated by clouds. camera pans away and swoops down from the copter. it crosses the sky. the camera descends to isla nublar, slowly reveling in its natural beauty and finally coming to earth in the midst of the verdant jungle. in the jungle magic hour hammond slowly climbs a steep hill covered with creeping growth. he almost reaches the top when he slips. he falls to the soft ground and rolls. he tumbles he lplessly, rolling and spinning down the sharp drop, finally coming to a complete stop in a shallow pool of water. face down, his head splashes into the puddle. no movement. just the sound of labored breath. camera pans to hammond's hand, half submerged in water. camera moves}
