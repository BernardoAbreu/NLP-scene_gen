<L>__{interior elementary school later}
<A>__{the children hang artwork on the walls in prep for parent's night. each child has a picture of his or her family made from colored construction paper and macaroni. evan's picture (no longer sophisticated) depicts his mother, crockett and himself on a green hill. tommy and kayleigh's pictures each show two kids and a single father. and their 'mother' is stuck to the far end of page. lenny beams as he pins up his picture of an ideal nuclear family. he looks at tommy's picture and is confused.}

<D>__{you put the mommy too far away. mrs. boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{you're such a retard!}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{mommy lives far away but she comes and visits.}
<C>__{lenny}
<P>__{(to tommy)}
<D>__{if i'm retarded, why didn't my mommy move away from me?}
<A>__{tommy gets upset. he swipes his hand down lenny's picture and his macaroni "mother" crumbles to the floor. lenny begins to cry.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{hey, what'd you do that for?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{fat little baby, crying for mommy.}
<A>__{evan takes the ruined picture and leans down next to lenny.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{come on, lenny. it's not that bad. you can still see your mom a little.}
<A>__{lenny, unable to stop crying, begins hyperventilating out of control. his desperate gasps for breath are frightening. evan, scared, looks around for mrs. boswell, but cannot find her. he reaches up to his own picture and quickly tears his own macaroni "mother" apart and places it over lenny's picture. it's a nuclear family again. lenny slowly is able to catch his breath.}

<P>__{(grateful)}
<D>__{can... can... can i have this?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{sure. i was gonna make a new one, anyway.}
<A>__{kayleigh helps lenny glue a new "mother" in place and she smiles gratefully at evan. as evan smiles back at kayleigh, mrs. boswell calmly enters the room in time to see evan tacking up his butchered family portrait. she shivers.}
