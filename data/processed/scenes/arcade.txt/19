<A>__{the manning place is your basic suburban ranch house, totally unexceptional. the lawn looks a little ragged and a pile of newspapers, frayed and yellowing, have accumulated by the front door. inside, the house is dark. lonely.}

<A>__{as alex enters the dark house, we can hear whispers coming from further within. it's a little creepy, but alex seems unconcerned. she negotiates her way through the darkened house, on into the den. den following through dim, flickering light illuminates the den, casting long shadows across a sleeping figure on the couch. this is alex's father, jim...hopelessly middle aged and getting older by the moment. it's the t.v. that's doing the whispering. cnn or something. from what little we can see of the rest of the house, it looks like a mess. alex bends down and jostles her father's shoulder.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{dad...dad...}
<A>__{jim stirs, though barely. he turns a sleepy face towards her, looking gray and lifeless.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{did greg call, dad?}
<A>__{jim shakes his head and sinks back into the couch. from alex's attitude, it's obvious that this scene has played itself out many times before.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you should go to bed, dad.}
<A>__{jim waves a tired hand, dismissing her.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{...am in bed...}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(standing back up)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{she turns and grabs a comforter that's bunched up at the end of the couch, spreading it over her father.}
<B>__{on the t.v.}
<A>__{we're getting a de saturated view of carnage...some sort of war going on in some far off land. alex grabs the remote and flicks the t.v. off, plunging the room into darkness.}
