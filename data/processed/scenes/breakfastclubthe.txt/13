<D>__{scumbag! bender stands up and walks over to the railing. he sits on it.}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{what do you say we close that door. we can't have any kind of party with vernon checking us out every few seconds.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{well, you know the door's s'posed to stay open...}
<C>__{bender}

<C>__{claire}
<D>__{really...}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{you know, bender...you don't even count. i mean if you disappeared forever it wouldn't make any difference. you may as well not even exist at this school. bender probably is upset at this and he pauses a moment before speaking. he doesn't let his emotions out, however.}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{well...i will just run right out and join the wrestling team. andrew and claire look at each other and laugh at bender.}

<C>__{brian}
<P>__{(to no one imparticular)}
<D>__{i'm in the math club...}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{see you're afraid that they won't take you. you don't belong so you just have to dump all over it...}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{well...it wouldn't have anything to do with you activities people being assholes...now would it?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{well you wouldn't know...you don't even know any of us.}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{well, i don't know any lepers either, but i'm not gonna run out and join one of their fucking clubs.}

<C>__{bender}
<D>__{so it's sorta social...demented and sad, but social. right?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{yeah, well, i guess you could consider it a social situation. i mean there are other children in my club and uh, at the end of the year we have, um, you know, a big banquet, at the, uh, at the hilton.}
<C>__{bender}

<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{well you wouldn't know anything about it, faggot! you never competed in your whole life!}
<C>__{bender}
<P>__{(with mock hurt)}
<D>__{oh, i know...i feel all empty inside because of it. i have such a deep admiration for guys that roll around on the floor with other guys!}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{ahhh...you'd never miss it. you don't have any goals.}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{oh, but i do!}
<C>__{andrew}

<C>__{brian}
<D>__{tights...}
<C>__{andrew}
<P>__{(defensive)}
<D>__{shut up! they hear vernon moving around out in the hall so bender quickly comes and sits in the chair between claire and andrew. he folds his hands on the table. vernon goes back into his office. bender laughs and gets up. he starts walking towards the double doors that separate the library from the hallway.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{you know there's not s'posed to be any monkey business! bender turns and points at brian.}
<C>__{bender}
<P>__{(in a stern voice)}
<D>__{young man...have you finished your paper? bender turns back away and goes to the door. he looks around cautiously and removes a screw from the door.}
