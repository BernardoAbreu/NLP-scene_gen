<L>__{interior hallway outside the library same}
<A>__{wills sees charlotte at the end of the hall looking around for him. when she spots him, her face brightens. she calls out facetiously as she walks to him }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{i thought i told you to wait right there!}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i got restless.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{well, i hope you didn't talk to anybody!}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{not a soul.}
<L>__{interior wills' bedroom night}
<A>__{wills and charlotte stand, disrobing in the near total darkness. they converse in whispers, between kisses }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{you know what would scare me right now?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{charlotte moves slowly through the darkness.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{this.}
<A>__{she yanks a cord by the window. the blind opens and the room is flooded with moonlight. the room is still dark, but she is far more clearly visible. her dress is unbuttoned down the front. she walks back to him and stops about five feet away. she releases the last buttons on her dress, then slides it off her shoulders to the floor. she wears only her underwear. she crosses her arms over her breasts, and smiles }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{have i told you my latest motto?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{if it's scary, do it.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i'm not sure i like that motto.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{i'm not sure that matters.}
<A>__{she closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, then slips off her underwear. she drops her arms to her side. she stands before him entirely naked. her self consciousness is excruciating but she is determined to endure it. finally, she opens her eyes and smiles with a hint of pride. wills' eyes widen as he takes her in. he crosses to her and lays his hands on her hips. he kisses her neck. as their breathing quickens, she begins to unbutton his shirt and pull it free of his pants. he takes hold of her hands, stopping her, and starts to ease her toward the bed. she resists. wills falters and she realizes something.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{you're scared, too.}
<A>__{from his expression, she knows she is right.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{your turn.}
<A>__{for the first time since we've met him, wills is utterly at a loss. but he sees that charlotte has no intention of backing down. he begins to undress. his hands are uncertain as he untucks his shirt and unbuckles his belt. when he is finished undressing, he turns to face her, his arms at his side. although we cannot see him in the moonlight and shadows, charlotte can. she looks down at his naked body and studies it. he stares back with shy wariness. then she breaks into a crooked grin }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{what's the matter, old man? can't afford a gym?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{that's it!}
<A>__{laughing, he grabs her wrists and throws her on the bed. she dissolves into paroxysms of laughter.}
