<L>__{int schaefer's office. rko lot day}
<A>__{welles paces before schaefer's massive desk with typical combustible energy. behind the desk, huge picture windows show the bustling activities of the rko lot.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{it's an awful title, of course, but i can't think of anything better. someone came up with a sea of upturned faces which has a nice, grand ring to it and i thought of john citizen, usa but that strikes me as a bit warner brothers. or, god forbid, capraesque. i suppose american will do for now but }
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{citizen kane}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{pardon?}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{citizen kane there's your title.}
<A>__{welles muses}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{a "z" and a "k" in the title. that would draw the eye. for the poster. i like that the prisoner of zenda had a "z" and a "p" and that worked }
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{now look, orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves. the budget projections on this }
<C>__{welles}
<P>__{(theatrically)}
<D>__{i know, i know! but what more can you expect of me?! i have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to !}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{listen, get off your horse with me. you know i've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like, while the stockholders in new york were ready to cut and run and everyone else in hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room. but your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. this one's gonna come in at 750 thousand. what do we do about that?}
<A>__{a beat}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{now don't have a fit but i want you to think again about doing war of the worlds }
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{jesus}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{do war of the worlds as a feature and everyone's happy. you make some money and new york's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to kane.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{please don't ask me to do this.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{it's the safe bet, orson. there's nothing wrong with that.}
<A>__{a long pause as welles leans against a wall, his head down he does not look at schaefer as:}
<C>__{welles}
<P>__{(simply)}
<D>__{george, i want you to let me make this movie because i need to make it. and i don't really know why. afterwards there' ii be all the time in the world to make money and sell popcorn. and i will do that for you. for rko and new york. but for now ... please let me tell this story.}
<A>__{a beat. welles finally looks up at schaefer}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{it's your decision, george. if you look into my eyes right now and say, go make war of the worlds, i will. i will make it. and, yes, it'll make you money.}
<A>__{and i honestly can't think of a reason in the world why you should let me do kane other than that you should. a long pause as schaefer studies welles. then}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{if it'll get you the hell out of my office, go ahead and make the picture.}
<A>__{welles drops his head, too moved to speak. then he nods to schaefer and begins to leave.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{say thank you, orson.}
<A>__{welles glances at him.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{for the title}
<C>__{welles}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{ah, it's a grand title.}
<A>__{he sweeps out. schaefer smiles and shakes his head.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{like it would kill him to say thank you}
