<T>__{quick cut to bialystock:}
<A>__{'s sleeping face. his eyes pop open.}
<T>__{cut back to bloom:}
<B>__{.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{yes. yes. it's quite possible. if he were certain the show would fail, a man could make a fortune.}
<T>__{cut to bialystock:}
<B>__{. by now he is halfway across the room. his whole being tingling with alertness. he moves to}
<A>__{bloom's desk and hovers over him, waiting expectantly for more information. but bloom is lost in his work, unaware}
<B>__{that bialystock is hanging on his every word.}
<C>__{bialystock}
<D>__{yes???}
<A>__{bloom looks up. he is startled to see bialystock's face so}
<B>__{close to his own.}
<C>__{bloom}
<P>__{(at a loss)}
<D>__{yes, what?}
<C>__{bialystock}
<D>__{what you were saying. keep talking.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{what was i saying?}
<C>__{bialystock}
<D>__{you were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.}
<C>__{bloom}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{yes, it's quite possible.}
<C>__{bialystock}
<D>__{you keep saying that, but you don't tell me how. how could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit?}
<A>__{bloom, slightly exasperated, puts his pencil down and faces}
<B>__{bialystock. he speaks to bialystock as a teacher would a student.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{it's simply a matter of creative accounting. let us assume, just for the moment, that you are a dishonest man.}
<C>__{bialystock}
<D>__{assume away!}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{well, it's very easy. you simply raise more money than you really need.}
<C>__{bialystock}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{you've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.}
<C>__{bialystock}
<D>__{what did i do?}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{you raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.}
<C>__{bialystock}
<D>__{so what? what did it get me? i'm wearing a cardboard belt.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{ahhhhhh! but that's where you made your error. you didn't go all the way. you see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.}
<C>__{bialystock}
<D>__{but the play only cost $60,000 to produce.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{exactly. and how long did it run?}
<C>__{bialystock}
<D>__{one night.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{see? you could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.}
<C>__{bialystock}
<D>__{but what if the play was a hit?}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{oh, you'd go to jail. if the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?}
<C>__{bialystock}
<D>__{aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!! so, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{what scheme?}
<C>__{bialystock}
<D>__{what scheme? your scheme, you bloody little genius.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{oh, no. no. no. i meant no scheme. i merely posed a little, academic accounting theory. it's just a thought.}
<C>__{bialystock}
<D>__{bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts!}
<B>__{bialystock starts moving in on bloom.}
<C>__{bialystock}
<D>__{don't you see, bloom. darling, bloom, glorious bloom, it's so simple. step one: we find the worst play in the world a sure flop. step two: i raise a million dollars there's a lot of little old ladies in this world. step three: you go back to work on the books. phoney lists of backers one for the government, one for us. you can do it, bloom, you're a wizard.}
<C>__{bialystock }
<D>__{step four: we open on broadway and before you can say 'step five' we close on broadway. step six: we take our million dollars and fly to rio de janiero.}
<B>__{bialystock grabs bloom in his arms and begins to lead him in a wild tango around the room.}
<C>__{bialystock}
<P>__{(sings)}
<D>__{"ah, rio, rio by the seao, meo, myo, meo ... "}
<C>__{bloom}
<P>__{(afraid of the}
<D>__{scheme, afraid of the}
<P>__{dance, afraid of bialystock)}
<D>__{mr. bialystock. no. wait. please. you're holding me too tight. i'm an honest man. you don't understand.}
<C>__{bialystock}
<P>__{(leading bloom as he talks)}
<D>__{no, bloom, you don't understand. this is fate, this is destiny. there's no avoiding it.}
<A>__{at this point, bialystock sweeps bloom into an elaborate dip.}
<C>__{bloom}
<P>__{(the back of his head}
<D>__{practically touching}
<P>__{the floor)}
<D>__{mr. bialystock, not more than five minutes ago, against my better judgment, i doctored your books. that, sir, is the ultimate extent of my criminal life.}
<B>__{bialystock raises his fists to the heavens in despair.}
<A>__{bloom, experiencing a definite lack of support, goes crashing}
<B>__{to the floor.}
<C>__{bialystock}
<D>__{ooooohh! ooooohh! ooooohh! ooooohh! i want that money!}
<B>__{camera on bloom as he lies stricken on the floor.}
<C>__{bloom}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{oh, i fell on my keys.}
<P>__{(he shifts slightly to make himself more comfortable)}
<D>__{i've got to get out of here.}
<C>__{bialystock}
<P>__{(angrily hovering over bloom)}
<D>__{you miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar. don't you ever want to become a butterfly? don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?}
<B>__{bialystock flaps his arms like a huge predatory bird.}
<C>__{bloom}
<P>__{(his eyes widened in terror)}
<D>__{you're going to jump on me.}
<B>__{bialystock stares at him incredulously.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{you're going to jump on me. i know you're going to jump on me like nero jumped on poppea.}
<C>__{bialystock}
<P>__{(nonplussed)}
<D>__{what???}
<C>__{bloom}
<P>__{(by now he is shrieking)}
<D>__{poppea. she was his wife. and she was unfaithful to him. so he got mad and he jumped on her. up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug. please don't jump on me.}
<C>__{bialystock}
<P>__{(shouting and jumping up and down next to bloom)}
<D>__{i'm not going to jump on you!}
<C>__{bloom}
<P>__{(rolling away in terror)}
<D>__{aaaaaaaaaa!}
<C>__{bialystock}
<P>__{(hoisting bloom to his feet)}
<D>__{will you get a hold on yourself.}
<C>__{bloom}
<P>__{(up on his feet and running for cover)}
<D>__{don't touch me! don't touch me!}
<A>__{he runs to a corner of the room. trapped! he turns.}
<C>__{bialystock}
<D>__{what are you afraid of? i'm not going to hurt you! what's the matter with you?}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{i'm hysterical. i'm having hysterics. i'm hysterical. i can't stop. when i get like this, i can't stop. i'm hysterical.}
<B>__{bialystock rushes to the desk. picks up a carafe of water}
<A>__{and shoshes its contents into bloom's face.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{i'm wet! i'm wet! i'm hysterical and i'm wet!}
<A>__{bialystock in a desperate move to stop bloom's hysterics,}
<B>__{slaps him across the face.}
<C>__{bloom}
<P>__{(holding his face)}
<D>__{i'm in pain! and i'm wet! and i'm still hysterical!}
<B>__{bialystock raises his hand again.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{no! no! don't hit. it doesn't help. it only increases my sense of danger.}
<C>__{bialystock}
<D>__{what can i do? what can i do? you're getting me hysterical.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{go away from me. you frighten me.}
<P>__{(he indicates the sofa)}
<D>__{sit over there.}
<B>__{bialystock sits on the sofa.}
<C>__{bialystock}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{okay. i'm way over here. is that better?}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{it's a little better, but you still look angry.}
<C>__{bialystock}
<D>__{how's this?}
<P>__{(he smiles sweetly)}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{good. good. that's nice. that's very nice. i think i'm coming out of it now. yes. yes. i'm definitely coming out of it. thank you for smiling. it helped a great deal.}
<C>__{bialystock}
<P>__{(for want of something sensible)}
<D>__{well, you know what they say, "smile and the world smiles with you." heh, heh.}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{the man should be in a straight jacket.}
<P>__{(to bloom)}
<D>__{feeling better?}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{much, thank you. but i am a little lightheaded. maybe i should eat something. hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.}
<C>__{bialystock}
<D>__{they certainly do. they certainly do. come, let me take you to lunch.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{that's very kind of you, mr. bialystock, but i ...}
<C>__{bialystock}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{nonsense, nonsense, my dear boy. i lowered your blood sugar, but least i could do is raise it a little.}
<B>__{bloom looks at him suspiciously.}
<C>__{bialystock}
<D>__{and i promise you faithfully, i won't discuss that silly scheme to make a million dollars anymore.}
<A>__{bialystock dons his cape and "belasco" hat. from a rack he selects a gold topped walking stick. he goes to door, opens it, and with a grand flourish, motions bloom to precede him.}
<C>__{bialystock}
<D>__{avanti!}
<B>__{bloom graciously complies. they exit.}
