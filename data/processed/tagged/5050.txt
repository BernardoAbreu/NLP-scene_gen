<B>__{opening title sequence}
<L>__{exterior san diego day}
<A>__{it's another picture perfect day in san diego. the beaches, golf courses, and yacht clubs are packed with hundreds of rapturous citizens.}
<L>__{exterior bus stop day}
<A>__{a bus pulls up and unloads it's passengers. we follow adam schwartz(25), a kind faced, mild mannered, pragmatist who despite his youth has the cynicism of an old man. he steps off the bus, crosses the street and approaches}
<B>__{mount sinai hospital.}
<L>__{interior mount sinai hospital day}
<A>__{adam enters the hospital. the mood is calm. all the chaos one would expect to find in a hospital of this size is tucked away behind the sterile and monochrome walls. adam walks to the reception counter. the receptionist is engrossed with the latest edition of us weekly. she ignores adam who just stands there awkwardly, unsure of what to do. adam gives out a small cough to grab her attention. the receptionist keeps her eyes fixed on her magazine.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{can i help you?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i have an appointment.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{name?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{adam schwartz.}
<A>__{the receptionist says nothing. adam stands silent, not knowing what to do. he coughs again. annoyed, the receptionist looks up but says nothing.}
<C>__{adam }
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{um, am i supposed to go somewhere?}
<A>__{with her eyes the receptionist points to the waiting area.}
<C>__{adam }
<D>__{oh, should i go sit?}
<A>__{the receptionist rolls her eyes and returns to her magazine. adam looks around the empty waiting room. he takes a seat and browses through a dozen outdated magazines: highlights, time, life, modern maternity, etc. only moments later, as though he hadn't just introduced himself, the receptionist calls out:}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{adam schwartz.}
<A>__{adam looks around the waiting room. there's no one else there. again the receptionist calls out again }
<C>__{receptionist }
<D>__{adam schwartz.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{yeah, that's me.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{follow me.}
<A>__{the receptionist leads adam to a small changing room and hands him a hospital gown.}
<C>__{receptionist }
<D>__{put this on.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{do i need to take off all my clothes?}
<A>__{the receptionist stares blankly at adam.}
<C>__{adam }
<D>__{i will figure it out.}
<A>__{the receptionist leaves. adam awkwardly undresses and slips on the hospital gown. unsure which end of the gown is the front, adam adjusts the garment a few times until he decides he has it right. adam pulls back the curtain of the changing room to find joanne, an overly cheery nurse.}
<C>__{nurse joanne}
<D>__{hi adam, my name is joanne, so nice to meet you.}
<A>__{adam scratches his chest, the hospital gown is beginning to irritate his skin.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{you don't happen to have anything in a cotton blend?}
<C>__{nurse joanne}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{cotton. you're funny.}
<A>__{joanne hands adam a giant specimen cup marked with a thick yellow line.}
<C>__{nurse joanne }
<D>__{now i'm going to need you to fill this cup with urine. you think you can do that?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{you want me to fill this entire cup.}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{yup.}
<A>__{adam looks down at the cup in total disbelief.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{it's gonna take me at least a week to fill this. can i take it home?}
<C>__{joanne}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{take it home. you're so funny.}
<A>__{the camera pans to reveal a group of medical students taking diligent notes in the background. we pan again this time to the next room:}
<L>__{interior hospital. bathroom}
<A>__{adam struggles to fill the cup. after a few beats, there's a knock on the door.}
<C>__{joanne }
<D>__{you okay in there adam?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{just another minute.}
<A>__{adam looks down at the empty cup in frustration. the camera pans to the next room:}
<L>__{interior hospital. x ray room}
<A>__{adam stands in front of an x ray machine. the apathetic technician has him stand in a dozen uncomfortable positions for long periods of time: sideways, one arm in the air, then the other arm, on one leg, then the other, one leg in the air, then the other, and so on. again we see the group of medical students taking notes. the camera pans to the next room:}
<L>__{interior hospital. examining room}
<A>__{joanne pulls out a giant needle.}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{here comes the choo choo!}
<A>__{in the back we see the med students still taking notes. the camera pans to the next room:}
<L>__{interior hospital. mri room}
<A>__{adam is lying on the gurney of an mri machine. he is slowly drawn into the enclosed body scanner.}
<C>__{technician}
<P>__{(authoritatively)}
<D>__{now make sure you lie completely still. otherwise we'll have to do it all over again. which we're not going to have to do, right?}
<L>__{interior hospital. mri room later}
<A>__{adam lies perfectly still in the enclosed body scanner.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{hello? is anybody out there?}
<A>__{there's no one there. he's been left unattended. the mri technician is watching the laker game in the next room.}
<C>__{adam }
<D>__{i have to pee.}
<A>__{the med students continue to take notes.}
<B>__{end opening title sequence}
<L>__{exterior san diego evening}
<A>__{through the window of the hospital the camera pulls out and pans across the san diego skyline. we watch as the sun sets to night, then rises to morning...}
<L>__{exterior san diego beach morning}
<D>__{super: june}
<A>__{it's a gray morning as the thick spring fog slowly begins to lift. with no one in sight, the only sound that can be heard is that of the waves crashing onto the shoreline and then rolling back out to the pacific ocean. about a mile inland, we come upon:}
<L>__{exterior grand view gated community day}
<A>__{rows of identical two and three bedroom town houses with lawns groomed to perfection fill the community. this is southern california suburbia. the sound of the waves crashing gets increasingly louder and louder as we push in on:}
<L>__{interior adam's house continuous}
<A>__{the interior of adam's house is spotless. pictures on the walls: adam and his dad sailing. adam and his parents at his bar mitzvah. adam and his best friend, seth, at high school graduation. a university of berkeley hat. a national academic achievement award in the sciences. curled in a fetal position, adam sleeps peacefully next to rachel (25), his loving girlfriend. cute, charming, and artsy, rachel is "winnie cooper" all grown up. the sound of the waves crashing stops abruptly. a loud obnoxious alarm clock goes off. startled, adam jumps up. drenched in sweat, and completely disoriented, he looks around in confusion. after a moment, adam pulls an earplug out of each ear, and turns off the alarm. the sound of the crashing waves turns back on. adam pushes a button on the alarm clock and the sound of the waves stops, but the loud obnoxious alarm returns. he pushes the clock again. the alarm turns off but now we hear the sound of crickets chirping. again adam pushes a button, this time we hear the sound of a loud thunder rain storm, he pushes a button again, this time we hear the sound of loud clanging church bells. rachel rolls over }
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(asleep and incoherent)}
<D>__{make it stop.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{it won't turn off.}
<A>__{frustrated, adam tries pushing all the buttons. this only makes it worse. we hear all of the previous sounds simultaneously sound off. rachel rolls over and moans as she puts a pillow over her head.}
<C>__{adam }
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{adam reaches down and unplugs the alarm clock, bringing an end to the noise. he sits for a moment at the edge of the bed, collects himself. adam looks down at rachel and begins kissing her neck.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{mmmmm.}
<A>__{rachel gently strokes her fingers through adam's hair. something catches her attention a single strand of hair. she holds it up.}
<C>__{rachel }
<D>__{oh my god.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i think you have a gray hair.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i'm gonna pull it out.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{no! don't touch it.}
<A>__{adam jumps from bed. he rushes into the bathroom. rachel rolls back to sleep.}
<L>__{interior bathroom continuous}
<A>__{adam stands in front of the mirror and searches for the gray hair. once he finds it, he holds it out for a closer look. it is in fact a gray hair. he smiles.}
<L>__{interior bathroom moments later}
<A>__{as adam showers, he tries to squirt shampoo into his hand, but the bottle is empty. he looks over at rachel's large assortment of shower products, finds one that smells pleasant, fructis by l'oreal, and squirts some into his hair. he then proceeds to lather his entire body in the product.}
<L>__{interior bedroom closet moments later}
<A>__{adam dresses in front of the bathroom mirror. his outfit is well put together, but not what you would expect of someone his age more of a mr. rogers look. he pulls out a lint brush and meticulously combs his cardigan.}
<L>__{exterior adam's house later}
<A>__{seth (25), pulls up in front of adam's house in his white neon and honks the horn. on the bumper is a sticker: "let's put the christ back in christmas." overweight, well dressed, and wearing an air of confidence, seth pulls out a massive joint, lights it and takes a hit. just then seth looks over at 3 young school children and their mother waiting for the school bus. the mother's jaw is on the ground in shock. seth hides the joint and smiles in embarrassment.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{hi kids. beautiful day isn't it?}
<A>__{the mother quickly moves her kids out of sight. adam approaches seth's car. he spots his neighbors andrew and missy donnelly (late 40's) getting into their car. they wave to adam.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{hey adam.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(seems annoyed)}
<D>__{hey andrew.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{sorry about the noise last night.}
<A>__{adam shrugs as if to say "what the fuck?" andrew and missy giggle as they get into their car.}
<L>__{interior seth's car continuous}
<A>__{adam gets into the car.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{yo.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{yo.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{...what's that smell?}
<P>__{(sniffs adam)}
<D>__{are you wearing perfume?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{well, you smell like the cast of steel magnolias.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(smells himself)}
<D>__{i ran out of shampoo. i had to use rachel's.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{for a second there i thought maybe you'd fucked olympia dukakis.}
<A>__{adam tries to close his window. the child safety lock is on.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{can you unlock my window? there's a lot of pollen in the air.}
<A>__{seth ignores adam and turns up the music.}
<C>__{adam }
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{seriously, my allergies are flaring up. it feels like my nasal cavities are on fire.}
<A>__{adam begins to clear his throat, seth turns the music even louder.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{sorry music's too loud, it's making it hard for me to hear your whining.}
<L>__{interior coffee shop later}
<A>__{we see the morning bustle as business men and women stand in line waiting for their morning coffee. adam and seth stand at the end of that line watching the young couple in front of them who can't keep their hands off of each other.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i don't get it, that guy is clearly a total douchebag...he's wearing capris!}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{rachel and i used to be like that; like two wild animals in heat...}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{i guess it is only natural though, as we get older, more mature, things begin to slow down.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{sex every three weeks is normal? right?}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(in shock)}
<D>__{you haven't had sex in three weeks?}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{you think maybe she's mad cause i haven't asked her to move in?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{what the fuck are you talking about? i don't think she's waiting for you to ask anything. you're using her shampoo. next thing you'll be using her tampons.}
<A>__{seth laughs at his own joke.}
<C>__{seth }
<D>__{but seriously, let me get this straight she has her own place, yet she spends every night with you, in your bed, but she won't sleep with you?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{it's not that big a deal.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{so when does it become a big deal? five weeks? six weeks? a year? my cut off...4 days. that's when i begin to worry.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{do you realize how lucky i am to be with rachel?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{look around, there are like a million rachel's in this city alone...well, she's kind of hot, so maybe half a million.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{but they're not rachel. i don't know how to explain it, but being with her just feels right. and i'm not going to overlook that just cause we're in a lull.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{my parents are in a lull, which is what happens after 35 years of marriage. you've only been dating her four months. at our age sex is all we have. every time she refuses to sleep with you a small piece of every man's soul dies. she's killing us adam...you're a semi smart, semi successful, semi average looking dude. just based on that you could get with at least one third of the female population.}
<A>__{adam and seth step up to the counter. they're greeted by the super gay barista, who loves his job way too much.}
<C>__{barista}
<D>__{morning gentlemen.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(to barista)}
<D>__{would you sleep with my friend.}
<C>__{barista}
<D>__{like, right now?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{no just in general.}
<C>__{barista}
<D>__{yeah, i'd fuck him.}
<A>__{the barista yells to demetri, the other barista.}
<C>__{barista }
<D>__{hey demetri,}
<P>__{(re: adam)}
<D>__{fuckable?}
<A>__{demetri examines adam. he's not impressed with what he sees.}
<C>__{demetri}
<D>__{i'd let you blow me.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(to adam)}
<D>__{see this is what i'm saying.}
<A>__{the barista hands seth and adam two cups of coffee, they each leave a dollar.}
<L>__{interior san diego museum of natural history later}
<A>__{adam and seth enter the museum. they pass jenny (30) at the information desk.}
<C>__{seth and adam}
<D>__{good morning jenny.}
<A>__{jenny ignores them.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(under breath)}
<D>__{i love you.}
<A>__{phil (60), the museum's vivacious director approaches.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{salutations gentlemen.}
<A>__{phil sniffs the air and looks at adam.}
<C>__{phil }
<D>__{are you wearing perfume?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{it's rachel's shampoo.}
<A>__{phil goes in for a closer sniff. then an even closer sniff. adam looks uncomfortable.}
<C>__{phil}
<P>__{(declarative)}
<D>__{fructis by l'oreal.}
<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{my wife uses that.}
<P>__{(to seth)}
<D>__{what are you wearing?}
<A>__{seth's eyes open wide as phil goes in for a sniff.}
<C>__{phil }
<D>__{what is that?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{ah, mothballs?}
<A>__{seth spots a group of second graders with their teacher assembled by the entrance.}
<C>__{seth }
<D>__{looks like my group is here.}
<A>__{seth slaps on a button that reads "docent" and rushes off to greet the students.}
<C>__{seth }
<D>__{see you guys later.}
<A>__{phil turns to adam.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{how's the origins exhibit coming along?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{we're almost done with upper paleolithic.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{i'm counting on you not to screw up.}
<P>__{(looks into adam's eyes)}
<D>__{you're the only one i can trust.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<C>__{phil }
<D>__{the board is talking about bringing in sponsors...we're a dying art adam.}
<A>__{phil stares into adam's eyes for what feels like an eternity. it's incredibly awkward.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{phil?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i should probably get to work.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{that's probably a good idea.}
<A>__{phil looks at the clock 10 a.m.}
<C>__{phil }
<D>__{i think i'm gonna go to lunch.}
<A>__{phil wanders off.}
<L>__{interior museum. origins of man exhibit later}
<A>__{adam and greg (45), adam's slightly moronic co worker, place the finishing touches on the cro magnon exhibit it's an elaborate life sized diorama depicting the life of a family of four cro magnons. outside their hut it's snowing, but inside there's a large fire and decorative horse drawings on the walls. the man instructs his son to paint as the woman teaches her daughter to sew. we see greg positioning the fossil of a velociraptor next to the mother and daughter. the dinosaur looks poised to pounce. adam notices.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{greg. what are you doing?}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{it's a velociraptor.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{where did it come from?}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{the dinosaur exhibit.}
<P>__{(off adam's look)}
<D>__{why can't we just say it was the first domesticated pet?...people love dinosaurs.}
<A>__{adam cringes in frustration.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{greg you can't just...that's a 75 million year old fossil...just please, put it away before someone sees it.}
<A>__{greg reluctantly goes to put the dinosaur away. he flaps the dinosaur's arm in the air waving goodbye to adam. seth leads his tour of second graders. he speaks like a tour guide at universal studios.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{coming up here on our left is the "origins of man" exhibit on loan from the smithsonian institute. it won't be open to the public for a few more months, so you're one of the first groups to see it.}
<P>__{(spots adam)}
<D>__{adam!}
<A>__{adam looks up. he hates this part of his job.}
<C>__{seth }
<D>__{everyone this is adam, he's the curator of ancient civilizations here at the museum.}
<A>__{adam gives a reluctant wave.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{hey kids.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(to adam)}
<D>__{why don't you tell us what we're looking at.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(begrudgingly)}
<D>__{this here is a family of homo sapiens who lived in europe about 25,000 year's ago...}
<A>__{in excitement, the kids move in for a closer look. unaffected, the teacher stays back and files her nails.}
<C>__{adam }
<D>__{...these cro magnon's as they're often called, are the closest in the evolutionary chain to modern day humans...}
<A>__{kid 1 touches the cro magnon father. still talking, adam steps in and moves kid 1's hand off.}
<C>__{adam }
<D>__{...what made cro magnon so advanced was their sense of community...they were the first to settle on a single plot of land, devote to one partner, raise a family, and take care of the sick.}
<C>__{kid 1}
<P>__{(to seth)}
<D>__{this is lame! i thought you said we were gonna see dinosaurs.}
<C>__{greg}
<P>__{(to adam)}
<D>__{see, i told you.}
<A>__{damage control. seth points to a life sized neanderthal man holding a spear.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(in excitement)}
<D>__{who wants to hear about the caveman?}
<A>__{seth picks up the spear and pretends to charge adam.}
<C>__{seth }
<D>__{caveman. rrrrrr!}
<A>__{the kids cheer. annoyed, adam takes the spear out of seth's hand.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{this is homo neanderthalensis the neanderthal man. for over 150,000 years his ancestors dominated all of europe. but then about 30,000 years ago, neanderthals began to disappear, until one day, their entire civilization was gone.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{greg you know what happened.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{i do?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{come on! tell us what happened to the caveman.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{well no one knows for sure. but it's suspected that because neanderthal was a nomadic huntsman, he roamed the land, only fending for himself never learning to cohabitate with others. so as cro magnon families settled into europe, they took over the land. one by one, neanderthal was pushed out...and never seen, or heard from again.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(game show voice)}
<D>__{that's quite a story. thank you adam.}
<A>__{seth and adam look at the kids, they look bored.}
<C>__{seth }
<P>__{(quietly to adam)}
<D>__{you really know how to win a crowd.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(to the kids)}
<D>__{but you never know, just cause they vanished doesn't mean they're gone. for all we know, there could be a neanderthal walking among us right now. and by the looks of this guy here }
<P>__{(points at neanderthal)}
<D>__{i'd say he probably plays defense for the raiders.}
<A>__{adam's joke gets a small laugh from the teacher, but zero response from the kids.}
<C>__{kid 1}
<D>__{this sucks ass.}
<A>__{adam and seth look at each other in shock...seth chimes in }
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i see dinosaurs.}
<A>__{seth runs down the hall towards the dinosaur exhibit. the kids follow in excitement. the teacher barely bats an eye as she takes her time slowly trailing after the group.}

<A>__{adam enters the hospital...}
<L>__{interior hospital. examining room later}
<A>__{adam leafs through a pamphlet on incontinence. the pedantic dr. ross enters and completely ignores adam. instead, he looks over adam's chart, examines his mri scans, and pulls out a dictaphone }
<C>__{dr. ross}
<P>__{(into the dictaphone)}
<D>__{patient has been complaining of excessive urination, back pain, and night sweats. blood tests and urine analysis are normal. mri indicates a massive intraduaral extradural}
<C>__{malignant schwannoma}
<D>__{neurofibrosarcomas extending into psoas muscle with nerve root compression syndrome and bone erosion.}
<A>__{we see adam's face gradually look more and more confused, he slowly begins to raise his arm as if to ask a question.}
<C>__{dr. ross }
<D>__{growth extends from the l2 to l5. cytotoxic antibiotics are recommended.}
<A>__{dr. ross turns to see adam holding his arm in the air.}
<C>__{dr. ross }
<D>__{yes. questions?}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(dumbfounded)}
<D>__{i have no idea what you just said. is there something wrong with me?}
<C>__{dr. ross}
<P>__{(points to mri)}
<D>__{if you look here on your mri, you see this cephalopod like object spreading down along your spinal column?}
<A>__{adam squints. it all looks the same.}
<C>__{dr. ross }
<D>__{that is a massive schwannoma neurofibrosarcomas.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i still have no idea what you're talking about.}
<C>__{dr. ross}
<D>__{it's a malignant tumor.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{what?!...a tumor? no.}
<C>__{dr. ross}
<D>__{i'm afraid so.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{how is that possible?...i don't smoke. i don't drink. i eat healthy...i even recycle.}
<C>__{dr. ross}
<D>__{well adam it's actually quite fascinating. your cancer is the result of an incredibly rare gene mutation in chromosome 17p in the p53 gene that causes the growth of malignant cells in tissue around the nerves. in your case it's grown along the nerves in your lower spine.}
<A>__{adam looks at himself in the mirror.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(still in denial)}
<D>__{but, look at me. i don't look sick.}
<C>__{dr. ross}
<D>__{cancer often has no specific symptoms. people can go years with out knowing they're sick. we're lucky we caught it before it metastasizes.}
<C>__{dr. ross }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm going to put you on a 4 month regimen of chemotherapy. it's an aggressive dosage so you might want to think about taking some time off from work.}
<A>__{this is real. adam walks to the window and presses his face against the glass. he looks down at the city below. from 15 stories up, the people on the street look like miniature figurines. adam turns back to dr. ross.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{can't you just cut it out of me?}
<C>__{dr. ross}
<D>__{yes, that is an option. but because the tumor has spread to a such significant size. cutting it out now would be risky.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{well what are my chances of beating this?}
<A>__{dr. ross puts on his best act of reassurance. his words are seemingly genuine, his tone is anything but.}
<D>__{dr. ross listen, you're in good hands. the best thing for you to do right now is to not worry...let me do the worrying. alright?}
<A>__{dr. ross takes a long look at adam's devastated face.}
<C>__{dr. ross }
<D>__{maybe you should talk to someone.}
<A>__{dr. ross hands adam a business card for the "mount sinai psychology group".}
<C>__{dr. ross }

<C>__{adam}
<A>__{oh good, i'd hate to think i'm anything but an emotional sheep.}
<C>__{katie}
<A>__{don't think of it in those terms. it's not like it's been a conscious decision on your part. what's important now is for you to be aware of the way you treat your emotions and for me to help you make adjustments.}
<C>__{adam}
<A>__{so how do we do that?}
<C>__{katie}
<A>__{the first thing i want you to do is to stop looking at cancer as a burden. cancer has come into your life to show you that your emotional and physical bodies are out of balance. this is your chance to correct that.}

<A>__{now, why do you say that?}

<D>__{i know you don't like to talk about your feelings, but you have to learn to find an outlet.}

<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{an outlet for what? i have cancer.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{and how is your body ever going to fight the stress of that cancer if you can't even handle your own emotions?}
<A>__{adam snaps, rasing his voice.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{well excuse me. you'll have to forgive me for not having a firm handle on my emotions at this particular juncture of my life.}
<A>__{katie's a little shaken by adam's outburst. she stays firm.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{you don't have to be here.}
<A>__{adam knows he went too far. plus, that little outburst lifted a little wight off his shoulders, and he knows it.}

<C>__{adam }
<D>__{this is all too much for me. i don't know what to do. just tell me what to do and i will do it.}

<D>__{she's got some kind of creative block...it's her process.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{you have cancer for fuck's sake! if i was your girlfriend, i'd be baking you cookies and blowing you every thirty minutes. instead, she's yelling at you over some fucking painting. her art sucks. you don't want to put that on your wall. it looks like someone threw up a shrimp cocktail and then used it to spackle the berlin wall.}

<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(serious)}
<D>__{bullshit. she's fucking you in the ass adam. this is the one time in your life you can do whatever you want. if you want to smoke weed, then smoke. you want a 50 inch flat screen tv, then get the fucking tv! and if you want to go to mardi gras, then let's go to mardi gras!}
<C>__{adam}

<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i've been reading your books, and you know it actually makes sense...some of it.}
<C>__{adam }
<D>__{i'm not gonna lie, i don't really get the "dark night of the soul" stuff. but i get it, years of anxiety have taken over my body. i'm blocked...emotionally.}

<A>__{seth and adam laugh along with the others.}
<C>__{laughter therapist}
<P>__{(to adam and seth)}
<D>__{now what you'll soon discover is the true miracle and gift of laughter.}
<C>__{laughter therapist }
<D>__{learning to laugh at ourselves and others through non judgemental means is far more effective than any prescription drug, or, rehabilitation center. you see, when we laugh, our bodies release endorphins that not only support the immune system, but also release deeply stored emotional pain, and give us a fresh new outlook on life.}
<A>__{the laugh therapist opens his eyes and stares intensely at adam and then seth.}
<C>__{laughter therapist }
<D>__{we don't tell jokes here, we tell the truth and we laugh at that truth.}

<C>__{adam}
<D>__{well whose fault is that? doctor?}
