<A>__{a number of people are here. it's packed. we are on the dance floor. music: grandmaster flash's "white lines". rosario diaz is in the center of the crowded floor, dancing up a storm. she is having a great time, surrounded by many would be male suitors and louis. she is laughing and stoned, and her gyrations are wonderfully erotic and free. as she moves, she pushes the men away with a smile. all, of course, except for louis. louis dances a can can with two amused girls. though fat, he's surprisingly graceful. all of a sudden: coming through the crowd: bobby. when louis sees his friend, he lights up. bobby's furious inside, but strangely calm outside:}
