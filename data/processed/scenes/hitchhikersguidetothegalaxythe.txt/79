<D>__{this will all end in tears, i just know it.}
<A>__{marvin moves out, a few paces behind.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{i checked the guide for ways to rescue a prisoner from vogsphere. it said "don't." i'm assuming your plan is better.}

<D>__{well, i sort of had this idea we could...}
<A>__{a telescopic rod with a paddle at the top shoots out of the ground, smacks arthur on the face, then retracts. arthur is stunned. none of the others have noticed.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{did anyone see that?}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{see what?}
<A>__{they look at arthur. it suddenly seems ridiculous.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{they all walk along arthur at the back, perplexed.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{what was it?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{nothing. just my imagination.}
<A>__{another paddle springs up, double smack in the face. arthur leaps back. looks down. nothing. nothing at all.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{alright, stop. everyone stop and watch me. something's happening.}
<A>__{they watch. arthur walks. and walks.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{okay. i think we...}
<A>__{a paddle springs up and smacks ford's face.}
<C>__{ford }
<D>__{ah!}
<A>__{he leaps back, clutching his cheeks. arthur spins around.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you, too?}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{yes. what was that?}
<A>__{arthur lifts his feet very carefully.}

<A>__{he stops himself and looks round.}
<C>__{ford }
<D>__{what do you think, zaphod?}
<A>__{zaphod pulls his thinking cap down, thinks hard.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{i think we should keep going.}
<A>__{a paddle shoots up, smacks zaphod's face. they all saw.}
<C>__{zaphod }

<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{what the blazes is that?}
<C>__{ford}
<P>__{(very deliberately)}
<D>__{i have... an idea.}
<A>__{a paddle shoots up. ford ducks. it misses. he grabs its telescopic stalk. it thrashes in his hands. he breaks it.}
<C>__{ford }
<D>__{okay, don't think of anything. don't have ideas or theories nothing.}
<A>__{a beat. they all strain to think of nothing. several paddles shoot up. smacking them.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i can't, help it! trillian is in there somewhere and we need an idea to save her.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{i have an idea. (smack!) run!}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{ever the politician.}
<A>__{they take off running. a forest of paddle stalks erupts out of the ground around them, smacking violently. they come to rest at the side of a vogon building.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{okay, so...}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{...not thinking, not thinking, no ideas coming...}
