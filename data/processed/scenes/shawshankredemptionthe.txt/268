<A>__{a gorgeous new england landscape whizzes by, fields and trees a blur of motion. angle shifts to reveal a greyhound sceni cruiser barreling up the road, pulling abreast of us. camera travels from window to window, passing faces. we finally come to red gazing out at the passing landscape.}
<C>__{red }
<D>__{i find i am so excited i can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. i think it is the excitement only a free man can feel, a free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain...}

<A>__{roars past camera, dwindling to a mere speck on the horizon.}

<D>__{i hope i can make it across the border. i hope to see my friend and shake his hand. i hope the pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams.}
