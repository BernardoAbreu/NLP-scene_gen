<L>__{interior whistler's workshop dawn}
<A>__{blade steps out from the elevator into the workshop the place has been trashed. it looks like a tornado touched down in his absence. blade pulls out one of his .454s, cautious }
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{whistler?!}
<A>__{ and then he stops dead in his tracks.}
<B>__{whistler}
<A>__{has been strung up by his arms against the far wall, tortured and left for dead. in response to blade's voice, a moan escapes the dying man's lips. blade rushes to the wall, cutting whistler down with his sword, gently lowering him to the floor. as he cradles the old man in his arms, blade sees the primary wound two ragged puncture marks along whistler's throat.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{jesus, whistler, what did they do to you?}
<A>__{whistler opens his eyes, struggling to speak }
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{frost took her }
<A>__{whistler spasms and coughs, wincing from the pain.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{don't try to talk }
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{listen. you have to finish me off. you don't want me coming back.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{no, we can treat the wounds }
<A>__{but whistler is shaking his hand.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{too far gone, you know that.}
<A>__{blade's at a complete loss.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{whistler, i can't.}
<A>__{whistler clutches at blade's arm, his eyes burning with conviction.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{yes you can. now get on with it.}
<A>__{as much as he'd like to deny it, blade knows that whistler is right. he pulls a stake from his bandoleer, hesitates.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{whistler, i }
<C>__{whistler}
<P>__{(cutting him off, more gentle now)}
<D>__{i know.}
<P>__{(forcing a smile)}
<D>__{just be quick about it, will you? do it right.}
<A>__{blade fights back tears. with a wretched moan, he turns his head and drives the stake into whistler's chest. whistler gasps. blade wraps his arms around the older man, holding him tight as the life runs out of him, rocking back and forth after a while, the rocking stops and blade lays whistler on the floor. then something catches his eye a sharp view camcorder resting nearby, labeled, "play me". blade reaches for the camcorder, cues the tape frost's face appears on the tiny built in screen.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{hello, blade. by the time you watch this, whistler will no doubt be winging his way to heaven, thanks to your capable hands. if it makes any difference to you, he put up quite a fight.}
<A>__{frost touches a deep gash which runs across his cheek.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{now, i'm sure you're wondering about ms. jansen's well being. she's alive and kicking "ambulatory", as they like to say in the trade. whether or not she remains so is entirely up to you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i will make this as easy as possible for you, blade. you can find us at the edgewood towers. we'll be waiting with baited breath.}
<A>__{the tape cuts to static. blade throws the camcorder against the wall. it shatters into a dozen pieces. blade turns now, his eyes falling on the medical equipment karen brought from the hospital. he moves to the refrigerator, removing a canister labeled "sodium citrate". then he draws his sword. we can practically see the wheels turning within his mind moments later, blade stands before the open flames of one of the furnaces, heating his sword in the fire. he withdraws it it's molten red. blade turns, dousing the molten hot sword into the sodium citrate canister. the refrigerated liquid reacts with the heat, causing the sword to steam and hiss. when blade withdraws the smoking sword, we see that the gleaming steel has changed colors, taking on a bluish tinge, just like the sodium citrate it was immersed in. blade smiles to himself, satisfied.}
