<L>__{interior hallway night}
<A>__{they hurry down to the hallway, half expecting another creature to step into their path. dust is falling from the ceiling, and there are cracks opening up in the walls. any moment, surely, the whole place will be destroyed. julia's body has gone from the hallway; a trail of blood leads into the dining room. as kirsty and steve stumble across the hallway, they hear julia's voice, off screen, an eerie, ghostly voice.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{kirsty ...}
<A>__{kirsty hesitates, and looks towards the door of the dining room. there stands the bride, her white dress soaked in blood, her veil covering her face.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{julia?}
<A>__{kirsty takes a step towards her, but as she does so the veil rises of its own accord, and the chattering cenobite is beneath. kirsty slams the box closed. the cenobite howls, and disappears. steve heads for the door. turns the handle. as he does so, kirsty realizes there's one piece of the box unfinished.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{don't!}
<A>__{too late. he turns the handle. the door is flung open, and the engineer, clinging to the sides of the door, swings down into the hallway. steve is flung backwards against kirsty. the box falls from kirsty's hand. the beast moves to bite at steve, who scrambles out of the way, leaving kirsty in the front line. the box lies between kirsty and the engineer, which now uses its forelegs to crawl over the hallway towards her, its legs still bracing it in the door. she snatches for the box. the engineer, its mouth oozing fluids, almost catches her arm. again, she tries. this time one of its arms seizes hold of kirsty and drags her towards its jaws. behind kirsty, steve snatches up a piece of plaster and flings it in the engineer's face. it momentarily relaxes its grip on kirsty, who slides her hand from its hold and claims the box. she now has slime on her fingers. the box defies her manipulations.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{come on! come on!}
<A>__{the engineer crawls towards them. up above, the din of the roof collapsing. timbers and dust hurtle down the stairs.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{shit. shit. shit.}
<A>__{the engineer is almost upon her. it rears up, its saliva dropping on her. and then, miraculously, the last piece of the box slots into place. the same vortex that seized the other cenobite seizes the engineer. howling its complaint, it is drawn out into the darkness beyond the door, and disappears. its voice grows thin, and fades. finally, silence. the house is still. kirsty gets to her feet. steve does the same. together, they move to the door, and out onto the step.}
