<L>__{interior thrift shop close on clothes hanger day}
<A>__{screeching as it's slid along a metal rack. rachel is shopping for bargains, moving along racks of discarded clothing.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{louise, you've got too much great stuff.}
<C>__{owner}
<P>__{(from the back of the shop, laughing)}
<D>__{take it all, darlin'.}
<A>__{frank leans casually against a wall, not watching rachel, but watching the shop, watching the street outside. rachel finds something she likes.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{wooo! let me try this on.}
<A>__{she flicks a glance to frank; he's not looking at her. she pulls back the curtain of the makeshift changing booth, then stops dramatically.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(to frank, indicating the open booth)}
<D>__{farmer, do you want to come in here with me? just to be safe?}
<A>__{frank glances at her, then resumes his surveillance of the shop. rachel's head bobs up and down above the curtain as she changes.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you probably won't believe this, but i have a reputation for being a bitch.}
<A>__{frank says nothing. he gazes outside through the store front window and sees henry and tony horsing around next to the limo. a few small boys stand around the car. one of them is climbing onto the hood.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i didn't used to be. but you get known for being a certain way a way people think you are and pretty soon you get like that. can't help it.}
<A>__{frank smiles knowingly. rachel notices.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you don't think so? you're such an expert on famous people?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i've seen a few.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{and you disagree?}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(very flat)}
<D>__{you can be as you choose to be. it's an act of discipline sometimes, but it can be done.}
<A>__{rachel stops in her tracks... then opens the curtains and looks at herself in the mirror. also reflected in the mirror is frank.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{that why you never stay with one of your clients? they too undisciplined for you? or is it you're afraid you'll start to care about them?}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(without interest)}
<D>__{that's right.}
<A>__{rachel turns to frank.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{can't you answer straight just once? why don't you talk to me? i'm not such a bad lady.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you're too clever for me. i can't keep up.}
<A>__{frank continues to search the shop and street with his gaze. rachel steps closer to him.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{look at me, farmer!}
<A>__{frank turns and looks at her.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you don't approve of me, do you?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{disapproval's a luxury i can't afford. gets in the way.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{don't like emotions getting to you, huh? never mix business with pleasure?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{that's right.}
<A>__{it's a stand off. after a moment, rachel motions to an outfit on a rack just behind him.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{grab that would you?}
<A>__{frank takes a beat. looks out the window.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i'm here to keep you alive... not to help you shop.}
<A>__{fuming, rachel sizes things up, then grabs it herself, whipping the curtain shut behind her. a smile plays across frank's face.}
