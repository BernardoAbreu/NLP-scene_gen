<A>__{james leer slumbers on a green sofa, draped in an old sleeping bag. grady drops behind his desk, lets james' knapsack slide to the floor. he lifts his cuff, inspects his ugly ankle, then glimpses something in the knapsack. something yellow. something soft. grady reaches down and, slowly like a magician producing a magical scarf extracts marilyn monroe's wedding jacket from james leer's ratty green knapsack. grady glances at the young man on his sofa, then, looking very tired, reaches for the desk lamp ...and turns out the light on the both of them.}
