<L>__{exterior street sara and patrick night}
<A>__{walking. a heavy silence. sara looks over at him. patrick doesn't say anything. but after a moment, he reaches down and takes her hand and they walk on like this together. over music (e.g. busta rhymes' "dangerous.")}
<L>__{interior dance studio sara and patrick morning}
<A>__{practice her free form, a hip hop ballet hybrid. they're both tired, irritable, beaten down. they've been there awhile. sara makes a misstep. patrick stops. cold. sara grits on him.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{we should keep going.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{you messed up.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i know i messed up. i will get it right the next time.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{no. you gonna get it right now so you can do it perfect next time.}
<A>__{she glares at him, exasperated. so many things bottled up.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i can't work like this. i can't dance like this.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{like this. you dictating to me.}
<A>__{he crosses the room, cuts off the music. looks at her. sara walks over to a window seat near him. flops down.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{what's wrong, sara?}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{nothing's wrong.}
<P>__{(except)}
<D>__{i can't figure things out.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{what things? the audition? you ain't got nothin' to worry about. i told you. i will be there.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{things, patrick. things between us. things between us and them.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{i didn't know there was a 'them.'}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{well, open your pretty brown eyes, look the hell around.}
<C>__{sara }
<P>__{(he's so nonplussed)}
<D>__{everything's screwed up. nobody wants to see us together, not even chenille. i don't know why they feel that way. how can i know? maybe they have a point, patrick.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{they only got a point if you believe they got a point, sara.}
<A>__{she looks at him... and loves him... and doesn't know what to do.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i'm just saying that we should think about this, that's all.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{that's a fuckin' 'nough.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{why are you getting mad?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{because i like to think for myself, run my own life, and i thought you did too.}
<A>__{sara looks at him. now she's getting mad.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{you're never gonna run your own life as long as you keep running back to malakai every time he fucks up or fucks you over.}
<A>__{she's crossed the line. but patrick responds so deliberately, so calmly prosaic, that she doesn't immediately realize it...}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{first of all, malakai ain't never fucked me over. second of all, you don't know him, sara, what he been through. matter of fact, you don't know shit about none of it. so don't come off to me like you do.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i know he's lost, patrick! everybody but you can see that. and if you keep reaching back for him, you're gonna wind up lost too.}
<A>__{... until he erupts.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{who the fuck are you to say he's lost? malakai had my back when you were busy gee whizzin' in the woods with your backward ass, redneck friends.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{they weren't rednecks!}
<A>__{patrick yanks his boombox off the floor, glares at her.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{you know what? the hell with you.}
<A>__{sara yells after him. her voice echoes in the empty studio.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{the hell with you too!}
