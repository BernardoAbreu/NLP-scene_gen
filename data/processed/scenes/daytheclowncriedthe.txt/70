<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior commandant's office full shot}
<A>__{bestler goes directly to the desk and sits down. scharff stands at attention just inside the door.}
<C>__{bestler}
<D>__{oh, stand at ease. and, close the door.}
<A>__{scharff closes the door and moves over to stand near the desk.}
<C>__{bestler}
<D>__{i don't have to tell you why your commandant was relieved of his command here. this prison is a disgrace. disgrace! the latitude allowed by him will not be tolerated by me. understand?}
<A>__{scharff nods his head. bestler gets up from the desk and walks around it.}
<C>__{bestler}
<D>__{that includes the staff. i'm going to turn this place into a model prison, a credit to the reich. understand?}
<A>__{scharff again nods his head.}
<C>__{bestler}
<D>__{speak up.}
<C>__{scharff}
<D>__{yes, colonel.}
<A>__{bestler returns to his desk, sits, and opens a folder. he glances up to study scharff.}
<C>__{bestler}
<D>__{this isn't the first prison the ss has had to take over from the military. military men are too soft to deal with those...}
<P>__{(he nods toward the window)}
<D>__{scharff starts to speak but quickly changes his mind.}
<C>__{scharff}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{bestler}
<D>__{you were about to say something?}
<C>__{scharff}
<D>__{oh... i... was just going to say that i didn't hold with the soft treatment of the prisoners.}
<C>__{bestler}
<D>__{good!}
<P>__{(taking papers from folder)}
<D>__{our first order of business is to prepare...}
<A>__{he is interrupted by the sound of laughter o.s. he turns slightly and looks curiously at the window, then turns back to read from the papers in the folder.}
<C>__{bestler}
<D>__{our first order of business is to prepare all non aryan prisoners for shipment in two weeks.}
<C>__{scharff}
<D>__{where are they being sent, colonel?}
<C>__{bestler}
<D>__{work camps.}
<A>__{again the sound of laughter from o.s. and bestler looks quickly at the window, irritated. scharff, uncertain of his superior's reaction, tries to cover up.}
<C>__{scharff}
<P>__{(speaking a little louder)}
<D>__{but we have about 40 children, some only babies, with more scheduled to arrive tomorrow or the next day. they're not going to be much use in a work camp.}
<C>__{bestler}
<P>__{(his attention diverted back to scharff)}
<D>__{i'm aware of that. this order covers only the adult prisoners over fifteen. we won't have to wet nurse the children for long. other plans are being made for...}
<A>__{again he is interrupted by the laughter o.s.}
<C>__{bestler}
<D>__{what is that?}
<A>__{before scharff can answer, bestler goes to the window and opens it. prison yard long shot shooting past bestler through the window, we can see helmut performing for the children. bestler watches for a moment.}
<C>__{bestler}
<D>__{what is that supposed to be?}
<A>__{bestler, scharff med. shot scharff goes to the window and looks over bestler's shoulder.}
<C>__{scharff}
<D>__{that! well, you see, sir, one of the prisoners used to be a circus clown. sometimes he gives a little... well... a sort of show for the children.}
<C>__{bestler}
<P>__{(turning away from window)}
<D>__{a show! is this a prison camp or a traveling circus!}
<P>__{(he looks out window again)}
<D>__{am i correct in assuming that those children are on the non aryan side of the camp?}
<C>__{scharff}
<P>__{(almost in whisper)}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{bestler}
<P>__{(leaving window)}
<D>__{and the... buffoon? a german?}
<C>__{scharff}
<D>__{yes, colonel.}
<A>__{bestler sits on the side of the desk and looks at scharff, who tries very hard not to show how uncomfortable he is.}
<C>__{bestler}
<D>__{am i to believe you aren't aware of the general order absolutely forbidding fraternization?}
<C>__{scharff}
<P>__{(not worried)}
<D>__{i know about it, sir.}
<C>__{bestler}
<D>__{close the window.}
<A>__{scharff carefully closes the window. bestler walks around desk to stand leaning against the wall.}
<C>__{bestler}
<D>__{just what do you think fraternization means, lieutenant scharff ?}
<C>__{scharff}
<D>__{communication. social contact. giving aid, talking...}
<P>__{(shrugs helplessly)}
<C>__{bestler}
<D>__{how long has this been going on?}
<C>__{scharff}
<D>__{just the last two or three weeks.}
<C>__{bestler}
<D>__{and the commandant approved?}
<C>__{scharff}
<D>__{well, sir, children are very hard to handle.}
<C>__{bestler}
<D>__{this clown! who is he?}
<C>__{scharff}
<P>__{(trying hard to remember)}
<D>__{it's... i know. it's doork, the great.}
<C>__{bestler}
<D>__{not his clown name, you idiot. his number. his identification.}
<C>__{scharff}
<D>__{if i have the colonel's permission to leave, i will check it at once.}
<C>__{bestler}
<D>__{later. right now i want these performances halted. understand?}
<C>__{scharff}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{bestler begins shuffling papers from the folder. scharff, uncertain whether he has been dismissed or not, hesitates. bestler glances up.}
<C>__{bestler}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{immediately!}
<C>__{scharff}
<D>__{yes, sir !}
<A>__{he salutes and bolts from the room, almost crashing into the door in his flight.}
