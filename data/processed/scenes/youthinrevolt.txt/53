<L>__{interior lincoln (moving) day}
<A>__{the lincoln now tows the rusty rv behind it. nick watches sheeni continue to fawn over albert.}
<L>__{interior cafe day}
<A>__{nick and sheeni dine over coffee and a plate of donuts. nick watches her play with albert in her lap.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{sheeni, i think i love you.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{well, your hormones certainly do. and oddly enough, my hormones like you too.}
<A>__{sheeni releases albert and the mutt paws at her legs. her eyes well up with tears, a few theatrical sniffles.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{sheeni? it's... it's okay. we can visit each other when i get a drivers license.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{i hope that's true, but.. it's not that. it's...}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{it's my parents. they're... i fear they will never allow me to keep albert.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{nick tries to hide his hurt. picks up the paper with annoyance.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<P>__{(sniffling)}
<D>__{nick, honey. why don't you take albert? he could be our love child.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{no way.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{at least you could consider it, honey. for me. i've never asked you for anything before.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{maybe i could take him, but i'd have certain conditions. i would have to be the only dad on the scene.}
<P>__{(matter of fact)}
<D>__{trent would have to go.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{that's asking a lot. trent worships the ground i walk on.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{it's your choice. life with me and the dog you love. or a pet free existence with a shallow, egotistical poet.}
<A>__{sheeni ponders this.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{ok, nick, i guess i don't have any choice. i will break up with trent. but if he kills himself it's on your conscience.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i accept full responsibility.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{well, good, that's settled.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{not quite, darling. i want one more thing.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<A>__{a beat. sheeni looks pensive. it fades to amusement.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{do you have a condom?}
<A>__{nick lifts his eyebrows. now we're getting somewhere!}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{it has to be in a safe place. a nice comfortable bed. with no threat of interruptions. and for relaxation and mood setting some good red wine, preferably french. i want a new condom. not one that's been riding around in your wallet for years. consumers rated them a while back. i suggest you get their top rated brand. this may take some research in the library. i'd appreciate a photocopy of the article. plus, for supplementary protection, i want a name brand spermicide.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{how about i have a quick vasectomy just to be on the safe side?}
<C>__{sheeni}
<P>__{(matter of fact)}
<D>__{well, nick, that, of course, is up to you.}
<A>__{nick looks displeased that his sarcasm didn't register.}
