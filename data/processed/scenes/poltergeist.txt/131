<L>__{105 exterior university of california at irvine campus establishing}
<A>__{ day students mill about between classes. it’s a beautiful day at irvine.}
<L>__{interior psychic research center lecture hall day}
<A>__{dr. lesh and a senior advisor, anthony farrow. they are sitting in an empty lecture hall. monitors are everywhere. several people are filing out. lesh is exhausted. apparently she’s been through quite an ordeal. anthony farrow is twenty years old than dr. lesh, which puts him into his early eighties. he puts a comforting arm around her and sits on the desk, smiling like the wizened sage he is.}
<C>__{farrow}
<D>__{in a word?}
<A>__{he hands her back the video tapes.}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<D>__{in a word.}
<C>__{farrow}
<D>__{too graphic!}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<D>__{it was the episode as it occurred.}
<C>__{farrow}
<D>__{perhaps.}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<D>__{oh, tony... you too?}
<C>__{farrow}
<D>__{i so wish to accept what i saw. i’m only steps away from the old wooden bridge myself. to believe that something exists on the other side would be like a warm light in the window.}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<D>__{perhaps if tendrils of ectoplasm were all that showed up?}
<C>__{farrow}
<D>__{better.}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<D>__{a smoky shape lasting merely an instant.}
<C>__{farrow}
<D>__{even better.}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<D>__{nothing on tape at all... only sounds, rappings, a sigh.}
<C>__{farrow}
<D>__{you’d still be answering questions. they’d all want to go back to the house tonight. you gave them too much, martha. too much too soon. nothing was left to the imagination. this isn’t a science yet. it’s still a sideshow and your troubadours were not in their make up.}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<D>__{and these? what do you make of these?}
<A>__{she gestures to the dozens of jewelry pieces on the desk. farrow picks up a beautiful brooch. he holds it up to the light.}
<C>__{farrow}
<D>__{it’s the real mccoy, that’s one thing for certain.}
<A>__{farrow pins the brooch on lesh’s sweater and takes an antique ring, placing it on her finger.}
<C>__{farrow}
<D>__{dear martha. may we cross that bridge together someday? may all we believe be true. may we picnic in the clouds.}
<A>__{dr. lesh starts to laugh and punches farrow on his leg.}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<D>__{you old con artist. if only you were fifty years younger.}
<C>__{farrow}
<D>__{let me give you some advice. secret a few of those gems. come out of this with something in your pocket. the national enquirer pays more for inventing what we must bust our rumps investigating and for what?}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<D>__{okay, pops! i’m making you the accessory in this crime.}
<A>__{she picks out a set of earrings and stuffs them into her change purse. farrow laughs as dr. lesh starts to fold up the napkin containing the stones and jewelry. suddenly farrow stops her, reaching for something in the pile.}
<C>__{farrow}
<D>__{this is interesting.}
<A>__{he picks up a thin, wiry clip that looks like it could be a dog muzzle for a miniature poodle.}
<C>__{farrow}
<D>__{did this teleport with everything else?}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<D>__{yes, i picked it up myself. why?}
<A>__{he turns it over in his hand.}
<C>__{farrow}
<D>__{it’s a staple, a clamp for the jaw.}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<D>__{not something you’d wear to the masquerade ball.}
<C>__{farrow}
<D>__{no, but you would wear it to your own funeral. it’s a mortician’s trick. it prevents the mouth from suddenly dropping open when the body is in repose. it discourages a great deal of embarrassment and... fainting.}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<P>__{(with a shiver she looks at her watch)}
<D>__{oh darn, i promised i’d be back before dark.}
<C>__{farrow}
<D>__{martha, my dear. why don’t you let tangina have a go?}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<P>__{(sourly)}
<D>__{i was afraid you’d suggest that. tangina’s so... melodramatic.}
<C>__{farrow}
<D>__{yes. but she’s a house cleaner and right now with what you tell me about that little girl, i think it’s high time you brought out your big guns.}
