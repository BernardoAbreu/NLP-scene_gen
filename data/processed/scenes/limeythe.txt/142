<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{that's right, your life is shit, and i'm to blame. it's that simple.}
<A>__{that does it. susan turns on him.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{it is that simple. i blame you for everything . losing inhibitions and chicks without bras didn't have to lead to hardcore porno in every american household: that was you . the first on your block to turn on a camera in a hot tub and peddle it to your friends. a little recreational pot didn't inevitably have to lead to the eventual devastation of the inner cities: you made that happen, the first time you bought a bigger stash than you yourself meant to smoke. it happened when you made your first buck hyping some so called "event" that was over before it began or marketed some "product" whose only value was its instant disposability. you were the first person to see there was a lot of money to be made selling navajo rugs you've even stolen from the fucking indians! you looked at charlie manson when all he had to show for himself was a guitar instead of a knife and saw another merry prankster, the freedom of the frontier. your pal here }
<P>__{(avery)}
<D>__{ he saw gated communities. rich people coming to him with their money, terrified of what people like you had left of this society. why invest in a marriage and children when you had him ? he's your oracle. but you couldn't even trust in friendship, could you? still he's the dog you call for its dinner. because everything that might once have been fun or nice or sweet you had to turn mean and cold and sour. that was your "genius," terry. haven't you read your own press?}
