<L>__{exterior english military stronghold night}
<A>__{furious preparations: armorers pound breastplates, hone spears, grind swords in a shower of sparks. the garrison is led by bottoms, the english lord who claimed the right of prima noctes. now he shouts to his scurrying soldiers.}
<C>__{lord bottoms}
<D>__{gather the horses! align the infantry!}
<P>__{(grabs a man)}
<D>__{ride to the lord governor in stirling.}
<A>__{tell him that i will hang five rebels for every good englishman killed! form for march! the troops begin to scramble into the courtyard. at the same time, the messenger gallops to the gate and nods for the keepers to open it. they pull up the chains and the heavy gate rises. the messenger spurs his horse to gallop through and is hit in the chest with an axe! the scots, hidden just outside the gate, come pouring through, led by wallace! arrows pick soldiers from their perches, scots drop over the wall; the surprise is so complete that it's over almost without a fight. lord bottoms looks around in confusion...}
<C>__{lord bottoms}
<D>__{stop them... don't let... align...}
<A>__{scots drag lord bottoms off his horse; an arrow in a flexed bow jabs right up to his eye, the archer ready to drive the shaft through bottom's eye socket and into his brain; but wallace's hand closes on the archer's fingers and bottoms sees that the archer at the other end of the arrow shaft is none other than the highland farmgirl he forced into his bed on her wedding night. beside her is her husband, holding a scythe, red with english blood.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{on your way somewhere, m'lord?}
<C>__{lord bottoms}
<D>__{murdering bloody bandit!}
<A>__{the point of wallace's sword jumps beneath the lord's chin.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{my name is william wallace. i am no bandit who hides his face... find this man a horse.}
<A>__{the green eyes of the defiled highland bride flash fire. william takes his hand from her bow and looks at her, grief for marion in his eyes; for the sake of that she does not release the string.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{give him a horse.}
<A>__{hamish extends the reins of the lord's thoroughbred.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{not this horse. that one.}
<A>__{he nods to a bony nag hitched next to a glue pot.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{today we will spare you, and every man who has yielded. go back to england. tell them scotland's daughters and her sons are yours no more. tell them scotland is free.}
<A>__{as the scots cheer, wallace throws lord bottoms onto the nag's back and slaps the horse's rear. it shambles away, followed by the english survivors, as the scots chant...}
<C>__{scots}
<D>__{wal lace, wal lace, wal lace!...}
<A>__{close a gravestone exterior highlands day the marker is carved with the name marion macclannough, and beneath her name a thistle is chiseled into the stone. bagpipes wail like banshees and the priest who married marion and william now mutters ancient prayers as her body, wrapped in burial canvas, is lowered into the earth, under the sad eyes of those who just fought in the battle. opposite william stands old macclannough; he stares across the open hole that accepts the body of his daughter, his eyes full of pain, and then staggers away. wallace kneels at the graveside in unspeakable grief. from within his shirt he withdraws the embroidered handkerchief she gave him, and the bloodstained strip of cloth he gave her. he places the strip over her heart, and as the gravediggers fill the hole her returns the handkerchief to its spot over his own heart.}
