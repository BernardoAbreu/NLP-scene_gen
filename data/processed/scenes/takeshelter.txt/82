<A>__{samantha's car pulls up and parks on the opposite side of the street from their house. she gets out, puzzled by the backhoe and trailer parked in front of her house. huge light brown tracks of dirt stripe the concrete driveway. leading hannah by the hand, samantha follows the tracks to the backyard. in the backyard, samantha stops, mouth agape, stunned by what she sees. a 20 foot by 8 foot wide hole that is 10 feet deep sits in the middle of her yard. smaller trenches lead out from it. dewart leans against the propane tank in the back corner of the yard. he digs dirt from underneath his fingernails with a pocket knife. seeing samantha, he waves a hand. curtis' head appears from the hole. he stops when he sees samantha. they stare at one another. he can see her surprise. he continues up the ladder and walks over to her. dewart watches from the back of the yard.}
