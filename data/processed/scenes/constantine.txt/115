<A>__{john turns his attention back to balthazar, doesn't hesitate and hits him with a continuous tide of flame. suit and skin is peeling off, revealing something else underneath. the true form.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{how's he doing it, you half breed shit?!}
<A>__{john swings the flame aside so he can kick balthazar against the wall. but now his weapon sputters. shit. charcoal hand thrusts out, bats away the shotgun and grabs john by the throat. balthazar rises from the ashes. he may be burned, but he's one tough son of a bitch. balthazar slides john up a wall by his neck. john can't break his hold. he's choking, frantically rummages through his coat pockets. comes out with those sacred gold knuckles on his right hand. balthazar tightens his grip and john swings, clocks him across the face. the enhanced punch sends a dizzying ripple throughout balthazar's body. but he doesn't let go. john is choking, starts whaling on him. again and again each punch weakening this demon more. john finally gets him against the wall. right arm's tired so he slips the gold knuckles onto his left hand, and with extreme pleasure continues punching away. drives balthazar to the floor, right to the brink of death. he leans up, winded. watches in delight as balthazar strains to take his final breaths.}
