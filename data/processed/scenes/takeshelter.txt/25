<A>__{curtis unlatches a piece of the braided wire holding a separated section of fencing that acts like a gate.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{red! come on.}
<A>__{he opens it and looks down at red, who sits at his feet. he speaks gently to the dog.}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{get in.}
<A>__{red walks into the pen.}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{good boy.}
<A>__{curtis closes the gate, kneels and places his hands on the fence. red approaches so that his nose is touching curtis' fingers. curtis scratches him.}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{i'm sorry about this buddy. we just gotta work it like this for awhile okay?}
<A>__{curtis stands, wiping his hands off on his jeans. he sees the storm shelter poking up from behind the trash pile. he looks down at red. curtis walks to the shelter. clearing past the trash pile, the shelter appears, the mound fully visible. curtis stops at the angled doors. he studies them. a rusted padlock is snapped shut across the handles. he reaches out and lifts up the padlock. he yanks on it, then lets it fall.}
