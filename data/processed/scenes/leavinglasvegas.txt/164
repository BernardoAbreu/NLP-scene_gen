<A>__{ben gets out of his cab and walks up to the doorway of a grocery store. it is locked. ben looks at his wrist and then remembers that he no longer has a watch. he looks around, sees something and exits frame.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior rough english bar early morning}
<A>__{ben enters and makes his way to the bar. this is a dirty, dark place. an ageing blonde in leather hot pants is dancing by herself at the jukebox. a very drunk biker couple argue noisily in a corner, slurring their words. there ins not much gambling taking place at the eight slot machines. ben sits at the bar and the bartender slaps down a paper napkin.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{a beer and a double kamikaze please.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{sure thing. anything to eat?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{not quite yet. first i have to drink myself sober, then... a few crackers, maybe an egg and toast...}
<A>__{the bartender walks away to get ben's drinks, ben continues anyway.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{... then i will go home with the groceries and we'll have breakfast together, and that'll make her feel better about my condition...}
<A>__{ben is interrupted by the arrival of the biker girl. she is young tough and pretty. she puts an arm around him and presses against him.}
<C>__{biker girl}
<D>__{who the fuck are you talking to, mr?}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{why are you all dressed up, honey? my, don't you look fine.}
<A>__{she runs her tongue around her mouth.}
<C>__{biker girl}
<D>__{i am very bored with my date. would you like to buy me a drink?}
<A>__{ben looks around and sees the biker staring at the two of them.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(loudly)}
<D>__{do you mind if i buy her a drink?}
<C>__{biker}
<D>__{fuck her. i don't care what the fuck you do with her.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{maybe i could buy you both a drink?}
<C>__{biker}
<D>__{fuck you. don't fuck with me, motherfucker. fuck off. go to it, she's waiting for her drink.}
<A>__{the biker walks over to the slot machine and begins dropping in quarters, never taking his eyes off ben and the girl.}
<C>__{biker girl}
<D>__{see what an asshole he is.}
<P>__{(big smile)}
<D>__{i will have a rum and coke.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{barman? a rum and coke, please.}
<A>__{the girl leans with her back to the bar, closer to ben , who is facing the bar on a stool. she brings her face closer to his.}
<C>__{biker girl}
<D>__{can i stay with you for a while?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you mean move in with me? isn't this a bit sudden?}
<C>__{biker girl}
<D>__{oh, i don't have a lot of stuff.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i don't think my wife would dig it too much.}
<A>__{she moves to his ear to whisper.}
<C>__{biker girl}
<D>__{maybe we could just go find a room and fuck all day. you wouldn't have to tell your wife about that, would you? i could suck you like this.}
<A>__{and she begins sucking on his lobe. behind them. at the slot machine the biker is still watching. his face fills with a drunken rage.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{see, the thing is... fucking you would be wonderful, but i am deeply in love with sera...}
<A>__{the biker throws down his beer can and walks towards the bar.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{... and it's almost impossible for me to imagine being with someone else...}
<A>__{the biker arrives at the bar and grabs ben.}
<C>__{biker}
<D>__{now listen, asshole, i'm not gonna just sit around and watch her suck on your ear.}
<A>__{the biker is about to hit ben then holds back. he leans in and puts his face next to ben's.}
<C>__{biker}
<D>__{now, i know that she came over to you, like she does, so i'm gonna pretend that you're innocent and give you one chance to walk out of this place... right now.}
<C>__{biker girl}
<P>__{(to biker)}
<D>__{get lost, jerk.}
<A>__{the biker slaps her and then grabs ben by the collar.}
<C>__{biker}
<D>__{what do you say?}
<A>__{ben shakes his arm free from the biker's grip. he thinks about it for a couple of beats and then decides.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i'm sorry... but she and i have decided to spend a few hours together in a mo }
<A>__{the biker headbutts ben in the face, sending him crashing off his stool to the floor. his head cracks against the tiled floor. the biker walks over to him, picks him up by his shirt front and punches him in the nose. blood sprays on to his face. the biker walks out of the bar. the girl follows him quickly. the bartender takes a wet towel and walks over to where ben is struggling to get up, holding his face.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{you're quite a fighter.}
<A>__{he gives him the towel.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{this may sound silly, but i'm going to have to ask you to leave. it's what we do around here when there's a fight. men's room is around the back.}
