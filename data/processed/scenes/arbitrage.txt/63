<C>__{bryer}
<A>__{we're searching the area right now. so no boyfriend that you know of?}
<C>__{robert}
<A>__{actually we didn't talk about personal matters.}
<C>__{bryer}
<A>__{she was just an employee, right?}
<C>__{robert}
<A>__{well not an employee. i was an investor.}
<C>__{bryer}
<A>__{why'd you invest?}
<C>__{robert}
<A>__{why did i invest?}
<C>__{bryer}
<A>__{yeah, why'd you invest?}
<C>__{robert}
<A>__{she had a great eye. she found me}
<P>__{(points)}
<A>__{those bryce marden's there. they went up in value very quickly, and on the basis of that i agreed to fund some of the gallery.}
<C>__{bryer}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<A>__{would you mind if we searched her apartment?}
<C>__{robert}
<A>__{why would i mind?}
<C>__{bryer}
<A>__{it's in your company's name.}
<C>__{robert}
<A>__{oh, right. yeah. of course. sure, go ahead.}
<C>__{bryer}
<A>__{now, mr. miller...}
<C>__{robert}
<A>__{mmm hmm?}
<D>__{goldenrod 4.17.11 44.}
<C>__{bryer}
<A>__{why would you lease an apartment for ms. cote? is that something you normally do for your employees?}
<C>__{robert}
<A>__{actually i said that she wasn't an employee, but i think she'd just come over from paris if i remember, and she needed a place to entertain buyers.}
<C>__{bryer}
<A>__{so you leased her this apartment.}
<C>__{robert}
<A>__{it was through our holding company. you seem a little confused by all this...}
<C>__{bryer}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<A>__{i am. but i will get there. gimme time.}
<C>__{robert}
<A>__{alright.}
<C>__{bryer}
<A>__{now, i don't mean to be indelicate...}
<C>__{robert}
<A>__{but you're going to be indelicate...}
<C>__{bryer}
<A>__{well, from what i've been able to gather, she wasn't exactly an art star. i mean, she worked for a couple a dealers in paris, but...}
<C>__{robert}
<A>__{oh, okay, i get it, so why would i invest in her and help her find a place?}
<C>__{bryer}
<A>__{something like that, yeah.}
<C>__{robert}
<A>__{it's very simple, detective. i invest in people i believe in. i thought she'd do well, so i backed her, she did. it's is simple as that.}
<D>__{goldenrod 4.17.11 45.}
<C>__{bryer}
