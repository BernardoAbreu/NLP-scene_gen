<L>__{exterior north pole day}
<A>__{an establishing shot of santa's workshop. the lettering "north pole santa's workshop" is superimposed over the picture.}
<L>__{interior santa's conference room day}
<C>__{santa claus }
<D>__{i want to start by thanking all of you for pulling yourselves away from the workshop to make this emergency meeting. i know it's the busiest time of the year for all of you, so i will try and be brief.}
<A>__{as santa speaks, we begin on a painting of a meek and frightened looking santa claus. his eyes look fearfully to his right. below the picture frame is a plaque reading "st. nick the nervous. 1871 1941", we continue a slow dolly to the right on to the next picture. we see another santa claus, much more treacherous in his appearance. his eyes are fixed menacingly on the picture of santa to his left. the plaque below his picture read, "st. nick the nasty 1941 1970." we continue our dolly to the right, finally ending on a painting of a jolly, portly santa. below his picture the plaque reads, "st. nick the nice. 1970 christmas present." we cut to a wide shot of a conference room. the same nice santa claus from the last picture addresses a handful of elves. two reindeer flank santa on either side. their nameplates hang from their necks "blitzen" and "rudolph." at the other end of the table from santa sits his son damian, quite a nasty looking man.}
<C>__{santa claus }
<D>__{my father, often referred to as st. nick the nasty, was a tyrannical man. he was obsessed with making christmas the only holiday anyone could celebrate before the new year. since his death, i've prided myself on ensuring that the christmas season is one of tolerance and understanding between all races and religions. it's always been my belief that hanukkah and kwanzaa deserve the same respect as christmas.}
<A>__{damian whispers to an elf on his right hand side, and then makes the jerking off motion with his hand.}
<C>__{santa claus }
<D>__{lights please.}
<A>__{as rudolph's nose dims, so do the lights in the room. santa picks up a remote in his hand, and turns on a slide}
<B>__{projector.}
<C>__{santa claus }
<D>__{over the course of my career as santa claus, i've made it my mission to ensure that jews, christians, and african americans could all observe their respective holidays in harmony.}
<A>__{we see a slide of the hebrew hammer, an african american man (mohammed), and santa claus arm in arm below a banner in a mall reading "happy holidays!"}
<C>__{santa claus }
<D>__{i was responsible for pushing the happy holidays ordinance, in which all merry christmas signage was replaced by the trans relgious and inoffensive phrase 'happy holidays.'}
<A>__{we see another slide in which an assembly of schoolchildren are singing.}
<C>__{santa claus }
<D>__{it was nearly a decade ago, in conjunction with our friends in the jewish and african american communities that i supported a bill that mandated that 'dreidel, dreidel, dreidel' and 'i'm dreaming of a bright kwanzaa' be taught and sung in elementary schools along with the christmas standards 'frosty the snowman', and 'deck the halls.' which is why upon examination of my annual naughty and nice list it shocked me to discover that my own son, damian...}
<A>__{damian, preoccupied with the cigarette he's attempting to light, looks up in response to his name. a brown bagged bottle of booze now sits on the table in front of him. we can see santa and the reindeer in silhouette on the slide projection screen behind him.}
<C>__{santa claus }
<D>__{the heir to the red suit could be so filled with hate.}
<A>__{santa addresses damian.}
<C>__{santa claus }
<D>__{damian, when i learned of your ludicrous scheme to wipe out hanukkah, my first reaction was one of disgust. now, i'm only filled with sadness and disappointment. disappointed that i failed to teach you the true meaning of christmas. what do you have to say for yourself?}
<A>__{we being a slow push into damian as he ponders the question. the cigarette dangles from his lips. rudolph nods to blitzen. blitzen returns the gesture with a nod of acknowledgment. with a slow and measured pace damian says...}
<C>__{damian}
<D>__{ho. ho. ho.}
<A>__{on the slide projector screen behind damian, we see the silhouetted images of blitzen and rudolph goring santa through the chest with their antlers. damian cringes. blood trickles from santa's mouth, and with his last breath he utters the words...}
<C>__{santa claus}
<D>__{et tu, blitzen?}
<A>__{santa falls out of frame with a thud. standing behind him with bloodied antlers is blitzen. damian walks over to the newly deceased santa, takes his bloodstained santa's hat, and put it on his own head. from this point on in the screenplay, damian will now be referred to as santa. the elves in the room, in various stages of shock, stare at their new master in horror.}
<C>__{santa}
<D>__{what are you fucking midgets looking at!? get back to work! we have hanukkah to destroy!}
