<L>__{exterior house}
<A>__{anne comes out onto the steps and looks around. she stops short as she sees: long shot exterior street from anne's viewpoint there are cars lined up outside on the street. one limousine is pulling up in the center, two figures at the passenger door. one is climbing in. the other is guy.}
<B>__{closeup anne}
<A>__{she calls out urgently:}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{guy!}
<B>__{close shot}
<A>__{guy turns and closes the door. medium shot from anne's viewpoint the limousine moves off and guy comes toward her.}
<B>__{medium shot}
<A>__{anne comes down the steps and intercepts guy on the sidewalk. she leads him along a few paces and then stops and faces him.}
<B>__{close two shot}
<A>__{anne nods off in the direction of the departed bruno and speaks in a desperate, low voice.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{you didn't meet him for the first time the other day, did you, guy?}
<A>__{guy stares at her for a moment.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{you mean when you introduced us at the club?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{yes. did you notice how he stared at barbara that day?}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(awkwardly)}
<D>__{well, i didn't particularly }
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(breaks in)}
<D>__{he stared at her again tonight while his hands were around mrs. cunningham's throat.}
<A>__{guy looks at anne with an expression of growing fear and alarm. she goes on inexorably:}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{what did miriam look like, guy.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(awkwardly)}
<D>__{well, why do you ask me? you've seen her pictures in the paper.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{go on, i want you to tell me.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(haltingly)}
<D>__{well, she was dark, not too tall, rather pretty }
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{what else?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{what else is there?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{she wore glasses, didn't she?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{she looked a lot like barbara, didn't she?}
<A>__{guy suddenly begins to realize what anne is getting at. anne lowers her head, deliberately avoids looking at guy, as she asks:}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{how did you get him to do it, guy.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i get him to do it?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{he killed miriam, didn't he? tell me, guy!}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(suddenly bursting out)}
<D>__{he's a maniac. i met him on the train going to metcalf. he had a crazy scheme about exchanging murders. i do his murder and he do mine.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{what do you mean your murder, guy?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{well, he'd read about me in the paper. he knew about miriam and about you. he suggested that if he got rid of miriam for me, i should kill his father.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{you must have realized he was talking a lot of nonsense!}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{of course! i didn't give it another thought. and now a lunatic wants me to kill his father.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(beginning to believe)}
<D>__{it's too fantastic!}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(grimly)}
<D>__{yes, isn't it?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{you mean you've known about miriam all this time?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{since the first night. he gave me her glasses.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{why didn't you call the police?}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{and have them say what you did "mr. haines, how did you get him to do it?" and bruno would say we'd planed it together.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{oh, guy what can we do?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i don't know, anne...i don't know.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(with an anxious look across the street)}
<D>__{guy, hadn't we better go inside? your friend hennessy's watching us.}
<P>__{(she shudders)}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(sadly)}
<D>__{you see, anne, that's why i didn't want you to know anything about this. i wanted to protect all of you your father, barbara. and now that you know, you're acting guilty, too.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(desperately)}
<D>__{oh, if we could only talk to father or someone about it.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{no, that's no good, anne. i mustn't drag anyone else into this mess. come on. let's go in.}
<A>__{they go toward the house.}
