<L>__{exterior downtown street day}
<A>__{eddie runs desperately, as fast as a person off mdt possibly can. he still has the limp from his blackout escapade, too. he can't run fast. tan coat is gaining. eddie collides with pedestrians, steps on street sunglass displays, sends a saxophonist sprawling.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{in the end, my stupidity saved me.}
<A>__{eddie, panicked, not looking, runs for the crosswalk. eddie's pov a huge truck is barrelling, unstoppably, right towards him ! eddie is frozen. the truck swerves, up on the curb. tan coat must dive out of the way, knocking down pedestrians like bowling pins, as the truck hits a streetlight, mangling it then is whacked twice by two cabs piling up behind it. when tan coat extracts himself from the pile of prone pedestrians, his last glimpse is of eddie down the block disappearing down into a subway entrance. swallowed by a crowd.}
<C>__{tan coat}
<A>__{hesitates, but knows that he can't catch up. eddie's given him the slip. this time.}
