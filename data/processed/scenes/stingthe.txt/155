<A>__{harmon is resigned. twist and singleton pick up their gear and march into the office. once inside, we notice that the office has an exit door which opens to an outside alley. twist immediately removes his overalls, revealing the suit and tie he's wearing underneath. he takes out a picture of himself, a woman and three small children, and puts it on harmon's desk, replacing a similiar picture of harmon's family. singleton, meanwhile, has spread a few tarps and begins to paint the walls.}
