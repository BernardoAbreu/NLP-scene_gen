<D>__{ted! we've got a monster in the vault. it represents all the corruption, the deceit, and greed within us all. i must slay it. ted turner student}
<P>__{(worst acting we've ever seen)}
<D>__{mccandless, how many times have i had to tell you? i've had to tell you that you are a journalist and you can't get personally involved in your cases...or your stories.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{ted! i know how to kill it. and i'm the only one who knows. you can't keep sending me on stories and expecting me to do nothing! i look like some kind of an idiot. ted turner student do you know who you're talking to? i'm ted turner.}

<D>__{mccandless! you've got to hurry! the monster is scratching at the hatchway. he'll be out in no time. ted turner student}

<D>__{that's it, ted. fire me if you want but this beast must be slayed.}
<A>__{microphone in hand, chris makes haste. the camera runs with him out the door, through the corridor, up a set of steps to the hatchway. as he arrives, the monster appears above him in the hatchway crawl space having pulled off the board chris had nailed.}

<D>__{this is the only thing that can kill the monster. it's gonna be risky but without great risk, there is no freedom. so we will now hear from the famous singer chris mccandless.}
<A>__{a piano is pushed into frame beside chris. a young black student pulls a stool in front of the piano and begins to play. chris begins to serenade the monster, intermittently sharing the serenade directly into camera as well. he bursts into an uninhibited solo of tender is the night. camera tilts up to the monster looking out the hatchway, slowly dying from the song being sung. as the song continues to be sung and the monster continues to die, the audio recedes and video images go}

<D>__{when we were little, chris was very to himself. he wasn't anti social, he always had friends, and everybody liked him but he could go off and entertain himself for hours, he didn't seem to need toys or friends. he could be alone without being lonely. the secrets our parents kept, though unknown to chris and i, led to bouts of rage and even violence between them that we had been forced to witness since we were very young. it seemed like they never fought without us. i remember the first family meeting to let chris and me in on their plans for getting a divorce. they wanted us to choose which of them we'd live with. i cried my eyes out. but the divorce never happened, though the threats and meetings never stopped. it wasn't long before chris and i shut off we would tell mom and dad to go ahead and get the divorce. chris and i just wanted to get away from their fights and mom kept promising to get out and take us with her as soon as their company made enough money. dad had been the young genius [that] nasa enlisted to do [crucial] designs for the american satellite radar systems that would be our answer to the russian sputnik. and mom and he later started up a consulting firm combining her get up and go resourcefulness with his wealth of knowledge. by the time the company actually made its first million, the careerism and money seemed to erase her memory of the promise she'd made us. carine (v.o.) (cont'd) i think this is when chris began to see "careers" as a diseased invention of the twentieth century and to resent money and the useless priority people made of it in their lives. he'd begun planning to "slay the beast"...to make himself free.}
