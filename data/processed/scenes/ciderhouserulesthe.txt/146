<L>__{exterior cider house midday}
<A>__{rose rose is setting the picnic table for lunch when candy arrives.}

<C>__{rose rose}
<D>__{hi...}
<A>__{she keeps setting the table.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{i've got some more clothes for you i just keep forgetting to bring them with me.}
<C>__{rose rose}
<D>__{i don't need no more clothes, thank you.}
<C>__{candy}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{rose, i know what's going on. homer told me. i got pregnant, too about a year ago.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i've been through this.}
<A>__{rose rose looks down.}
<C>__{rose rose}
<D>__{you ain't been through what i been through, candy.}
<C>__{candy}
<P>__{(doesn't get it)}
<D>__{yes, i have!}
<A>__{rose rose dismissively waves her hand.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{who's the father, rose?}
<A>__{rose looks at candy and shakes her head.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{you want to have the baby?}
<A>__{rose rose shakes her head again, more emphatically.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{i know where you can go. homer and i can take you...}
<C>__{rose rose}
<D>__{i can't go nowhere.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{why?}
<A>__{rose rose stays silent.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{is it the father? does he know?}
<A>__{rose rose turns away from candy.}
<C>__{candy}
<D>__{you can trust me. is it jack? it's not jack, is it? it's muddy! is it muddy?}
<C>__{rose rose}
<P>__{(almost wistfully)}
<D>__{no. it ain't muddy. muddy's just...}
<A>__{rose rose stops; she can't even continue setting the table. her voice turns bitter, despairing.}
<C>__{rose rose}
<D>__{it sure ain't jack.}
<A>__{there, suddenly, is mr. rose, walking past them. he is uncharacteristically tentative.}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<P>__{(to his daughter)}
<D>__{i will be up top...}
<A>__{mr. rose leaves candy and rose rose alone again. rose rose nods almost invisibly after her father. rose rose looks pointedly at candy, nodding. candy slowly gets it. mr. rose is the father! rose rose lets that sink in; she keeps looking at candy with an ashamed expression.}
