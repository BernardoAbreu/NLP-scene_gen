<A>__{david parks next to a beaten up convertible.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{okay. i will get some steaks. alison loves steak ... wine good. candy? no candy. alison hates candy. we gotta do this right, bean, or ... (looks at bean) just stay out of trouble, okay?}
<A>__{bean nods. david gets out and heads for the mall. nearby woman tramp (bag lady) goes through a trash can. bean tries to control himself but weakens. he plays with all the buttons and switches on the dashboard; windshield wipers, lights. then he notices a throbbing noise ... he gets out of the car to investigate. bean swiftly locates the throbbing sound. the e empty convertible has its engine running. bean notices the keys in the ignition. how stupid of someone. he turns off the engine and takes out the keys. there are several people returning to their cars with groceries. bean offers the car keys to them as if to say: "are these yours?" [the following should take place at quite a speed, real drama.] then suddenly, a robber dashes towards bean from the direction ' of the mall, weaving in and out of parked cars, with a small white carrier bag, assumedly full of money. he wears jeans, a black polo neck and, much to bean's delight, a president clinton face mask. as far as bean's concerned, this is his old friend, the mime. robber throws the bag of money on to the back seat of the convertible and gets in but he cant find the keys to start it. he frantically searches all his pockets ... bean leans into shot. he holds out the keys, grinning.}
<C>__{robber}
<D>__{gimme the keys!}
<A>__{bean runs away with them. or doesn't! he is in mime mode and runs on the spot, getting faster and faster. the robber approaches this obvious madman. he is quite a tough, scary, and scared individual.}
<C>__{robber}
<D>__{i said, give me the keys!}
<A>__{bean turns and holds out two hands, just like the mime did to him. the perplexed robber picks one hand. wrong one. he then.... pulls a gun and puts it hard to mr bean in bean's face. passers by scream and fall to the ground, the bag lady amongst them. sudden harsh reality. but not to bean. he simply takes the gun, and waves it in the robber's face, ticking him off for breaking the rules.}
<C>__{robber}
<D>__{okay, okay take it easy!!!}
<A>__{bean gestures the robber to turn around. he does, sure this sicko is going simply to shoot him in the head. but instead bean puts his back to the robber's back, and starts to count}
<C>__{bean}
<D>__{1,2,3,4, 5, 6,7,8, 9,10}
<A>__{he turns and gestures to the robber it's time to draw. by this time a crowd has gathered.}
<C>__{robber}
<D>__{but i haven't got a f.....}
<C>__{bean}
<D>__{ssssh!!!!}
<A>__{he points out a small child, watching from behind a trash can.}
