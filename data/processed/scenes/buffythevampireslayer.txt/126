<L>__{interior pike's car night}
<A>__{on the edge of town. the car has stalled at an intersection. pike is hunched over the wheel, his head down as he listens to the rasping engine.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{come on, come on. don't leave me, baby. come on, breathe.}
<A>__{amilyn appears in the street in front of the car. pike finally hears the scraping of his feet as he approaches the car. pike straightens up slowly, and as the rear view mirror comes into the frame, we see there are two more behind him. they are both high school age, fresh like bessel and benny. they all approach, slowly. pike waits for a second, his hand on the key.}
<C>__{pike}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{this is for the money, baby. make me proud.}
<A>__{he turns the key again and the car roars to life. the headlights trap the hungry scowl of the vampires as pike pops the car in reverse, smashing into the back two vampires. they both go flying, hurt but not killed. angle inside the car pike races at amilyn, but he leaps up as pike reaches him, and pike hears a thud as amilyn lands on the roof of his car. pike continues to bullet down the street as a hand suddenly punches through the roof, grabbing at him. he fights off the hand and tries to control the speeding car. it can't be done: he goes off the road and into a park. the car careens along. angle on top of the car amilyn ride it, laughing. angle inside the car pike spots a tree with a low branch and heads for it. still fighting, he aims at the branch. it gets closer. angle on top of the car amilyn looks up. angle inside the car they pass under the branch and we hear a tearing thud. the arm stiffens and falls into pike's lap. the car hits another tree dead on. pike slams into the steering wheel. the guitar case flies right through the windshield and lands on the grass. pike pulls himself slowly from the car. he is bleeding, but not badly. just shaken. he hears a low, seething wail from a few yards back and turns around. amilyn is getting shakily to his feet.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{oh, give me a break.}
<A>__{amilyn hisses at him, then turns and races away, snarling, clutching what's left of his arm. one of the other vampires nears him. pike tries to run and his knees buckle. he lands on them right next to the guitar case. as the vampire nears, he pulls the guitar out of the case and swings it, hitting the vampire in the head. he hits him again. the vampire bats away the guitar and grabs pike. brings his face to pike's as pike squirms. a blasting kick in the head from buffy. the vampire is flung to one side, falls. he starts up at buffy and she nails him with a stake. pike stares at her. she pulls a walkie talkie from her pocket.}
<C>__{buffy}
<P>__{(into walkie talkie)}
<D>__{i'm on the east side, near the playground... all right.}
<A>__{she puts the walkie talkie back.}
<C>__{buffy}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{hi there.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{is that your car?}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{it was. i think it's pretty much ready for the }
<A>__{the last vampire hits pike from behind. without missing a beat, buffy picks up the guitar and snaps the neck off. she and the vampire meet in the middle the creature barely moves before she buries the guitar neck in its chest. it falls. merrick runs up. he is wearing black jeans and a windbreaker. he is more modern than he was before, but subtly. he sees the decaying bodies, one with a guitar sticking out of its chest.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{interesting.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{i kind of had to improvise.}
<P>__{(to pike)}
<D>__{sorry about your guitar.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{that's okay. umm, listen, i'm not.... i have to fall down now.}
<A>__{pike's eyes glaze over slightly as he collapses into buffy's arms.}
