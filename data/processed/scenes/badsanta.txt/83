<D>__{so i will see you soon i guess, right?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{yeah, i'm gonna send you some flowers. real good expensive ones.}
<A>__{he closes the door. he then tips back the bottle and polishes it off with a series of quick gulps. ever so daintily, he puts the bottle down. a beat later wham! he faints dead away, hitting the floor like a felled tree.}
