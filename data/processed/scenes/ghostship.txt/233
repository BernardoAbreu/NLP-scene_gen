<A>__{epps moves along on a metal catwalk in the darkness when something can be heard ahead of her. she stops. footsteps sound at the end of the passage. epps pulls back into the shadows, holding there. the footsteps sound as if they are coming down stairs at the other end, when the footsteps stop. epps holds there, listening intently in the silence when, at the other end, the sound of creaking metal, as from a hatch slowly opening, can be heard. it stops. all is silent, when the hatch creaks again at the other end. she begins moving toward it. as she approaches, she can see that the hatch is half open, swaying slightly with the movement of the ship. a creaking sounds behind her. she turns, just as murphy steps into view. she ducks as he fires and a spray of buckshot ricochets off the metal around her. she scrambles on her belly as murphy fires again. she swings down from the catwalk, letting herself fall to the next deck.}
