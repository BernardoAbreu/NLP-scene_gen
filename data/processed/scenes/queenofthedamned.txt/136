<A>__{jesse and lestat come out of the talamascan headquarters. he takes her hand and together they float up over the wall and out to the street. lestat pulls jesse into his arms. they kiss. it's long, deep, romantic. they pull away, gaze sweetly, lovingly, into each other's eyes... and exchange happy, fanged smiles...}

<A>__{she smiles, nods. lestat and jesse take each other's hands, move into the crowd, zipping through the streets at that strange preternatural speed... ... and vanish into the night.}
