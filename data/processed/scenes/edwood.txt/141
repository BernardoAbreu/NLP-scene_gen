<L>__{exterior griffith park night}
<A>__{the movie crew is setting up for a big night shoot. lights and generators are sprawled across this isolated area. tony mccoy perches goofily on his own personalized chair. he runs lines by himself.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{"now janet, i want you staying away from the old willows place."}
<A>__{the octopus lays in a dried up riverbed. there's only about an inch of water. ed yells at conrad.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{you don't understand! the octopus is supposed to live in a lake !}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{this is kind of a stream }
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{no! it has to be underwater!}
<A>__{ed storms away. conrad scratches his head.}
<B>__{in a dusty parking lot}
<A>__{bela sits inertly in the back of an open car. he weakly hails over ed.}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{eddie, i'm so tired... i don't know if i can handle a night shoot...}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{nonsense! you look great }
<P>__{(suddenly he catches himself; he speaks more sincerely)}
<D>__{look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap? we'll film around you for a while.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{thanks, buddy...}
<A>__{ed smiles warmly, then walks off. bela stares after him, then absent mindedly searches through his pockets. finally, he finds what he's looking for a rubber tube. bela looks to make sure no one's around, then ties the tube around his upper arm... at the set later crew members have dammed up the end of the river, and bunny fills it with a hose. there is now a foot of water . ed stands at the shore, admiring it.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{hey. this is looking good!}
<P>__{(he turns to paul)}
<D>__{paul, where's the octopus motor?}
<C>__{paul marco}
<D>__{what octopus motor?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{you know, to make the legs move }
<C>__{paul marco}
<P>__{(defensive)}
<D>__{hey, don't blame me! you didn't say anything about no motor when i was up on that ceiling!}
<A>__{bela stumbles up, with a dazed smile.}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{let's shoot this fucker! where do i go?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{you'll be fighting with the octopus.}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{out there ?!}
<P>__{(he points at the water)}
<D>__{what happened to the stream?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{this'll look a lot better. we have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{oh, for christ's sake.}
<A>__{bela rolls up his pants and wades out, into the water. he screams.}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{goddamn, it's cold!}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{once you're in it, it warms up.}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{fuck you! you come out here.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{hey, toss me that j.d.}
<A>__{a crew member throws bela a bottle of jack daniels. bela pops the cap and chugs half the bottle in one swig. he licks his lips, then climbs onto the octopus.}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{okay! how do we turn this thing on?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{bela, somebody misplaced the motor. so when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.}
<A>__{bela stares, deadpan.}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{do you know i turned down "frankenstein"?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{after i did "dracula," the studio offered me "frankenstein"! but i turned it down, the part wasn't sexy enough. it was too degrading for a big star like me.}
<A>__{the crew glances at ed.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{bela, i've got twenty five scenes to shoot tonight.}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{don't let me slow you down.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{alright! let's put it on film. camera! sound!}
<A>__{bela takes another swig of j.d., then throws it off camera.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{action!}
<A>__{bela starts flailing around the octopus legs and screaming in horror. this image is truly ridiculous. ed is pleased. some crew members nod: pretty good.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{and cut!}
<A>__{everybody cheers. then suddenly the dam walls burst. whoosh! the water rushes from the lake and floods the park below.}
