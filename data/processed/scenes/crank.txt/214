<A>__{still frame of a city street, traffic sounds camera down on the ground. a homeless guy ambles along, looks up, hustles his ass out of the way ... verona hits the ground smack! bounces, flies out of frame. next is chev he slams off the canvas top of a moving convertible car bam! chev flies high out of frame, then comes down hard, smashing into a news stand right in front of the camera ... trades and fish wraps rain over chev and the surrounding area... on each a different headline... “bo sox break the curse”... “bush to swiss: you’re next”... etc. the screen cuts to black. a beat of silence... is that it? then sound: lub dub.}
