<L>__{exterior interior barn night}
<A>__{as rachel, lamp in hand, walks up to the barn. she looks in to find book tinkering with the battery hookup to the lapp buggy. he glances up as she enters:}
<C>__{book}
<D>__{hi...}
<A>__{as she sets her lamp down near the one he's using.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{when will you be going?}
<C>__{book}
<D>__{not long... a few days.}
<A>__{another beat as rachel watches him... book, checking out the battery power, hits the radio and suddenly from the twentieth century comes the sound of one of its major inventions rock and roll. it fills the barn, but book turns up the volume a click more even and, eyeing rachel, starts moving with the beat. it's his culture, coming through loud and clear, as incongruous as it all might seem with the tough philly cop decked out in amish. rachel can't help but laugh... sensing her response, book sweeps her up and they boogie in the lamplight, rachel alternately protesting and laughing.}
<C>__{book}
<D>__{you like it... don't you?}
<A>__{rachel, confused, protests:}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{no... you just stop}
<A>__{but she doesn't really want to. book grins:}
<C>__{book}
<P>__{(mock alarm)}
<D>__{next thing you know you'll be off drinking beer and racing motorcycles.}
<A>__{and it goes on... rachel alternately protesting and laughing.}
<B>__{angle the barn door}
<A>__{as eli suddenly appears. he glowers for an instant, thunderstruck, then bellows:}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{rachel!}
<B>__{the scene}
<A>__{as book and rachel's dancing comes to a sudden halt. both turn, look at eli. rachel regards him level eyed, without discernible alarm. book, looking a bit sheepish, goes over, turns off the radio, as:}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(in the dialect)}
<D>__{what is this? this myusick?}
<A>__{book hesitates, then starts to say something:}
<C>__{book}
<D>__{it's not her fault. i}
<A>__{but he gets such a look from eli that he turns, goes out.}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(in the dialect)}
<D>__{how can this be? how can you do such a thing? is this plain? is this the ordnung?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i have done nothing against the ordnung.}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(in the dialect)}
<D>__{eh? nothing? rachel, you bring this man to our house. with his gun of the hand. you bring fear to this house. fear of english with guns coming after. you bring blood and whispers of more blood. now english music... and you are dancing to english music! and you call this nothing?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i have committed no sin.}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(in english)}
<D>__{no sin? maybe. not yet. but, rachel, it does not look...}
<P>__{(tone softening... in the dialect)}
<D>__{don't you know there has been talk? talk about you, not him. talk about going to the bishop. about having you... shunned!}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{that is idle talk.}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(in english, pleading)}
<D>__{do not make light of it, rachel. they can do it... quick! like that! and then... then i can not sit at table with you. i can not take a thing from your hand. i... i can not go with you to meeting!}
<P>__{(the old man almost}
<D>__{breaks down as, in}
<P>__{the dialect)}
<D>__{rachel, good rachel, you must not go too far! dear child!}
<A>__{rachel is annoyed also touched, no doubt, by the old man's plea but irked by his condescending tone.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i am not a child.}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(suddenly stern again)}
<D>__{you are acting like one!}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i will be the judge of that.}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(fierce as a prophet)}
<D>__{no! they will be the judge of that! and so will i... if you shame me!}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(blinking a tear now, but meeting his gaze)}
<D>__{you shame yourself.}
<A>__{and shaken but proud and erect she turns and walks out.}
