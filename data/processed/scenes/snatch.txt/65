<L>__{exterior portacabin}
<A>__{the film stock is 1970s, and things seem more dated. this is confirmed by the dress of our man tony. tony is standing outside a scrap metal yard and he is kicking the door of a portacabin.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{open up charlie.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{fuck off. the only thing i'11 open up is you.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{i t ' s lucky you .got me charlie, it could have been one of the other lads, and then think how much trouble you' d be in.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you come through that door and you'll be going out prostrate.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{it doesn't belong to you charlie.}
<A>__{he kicks open the door. charlie is standing behind his desk holding a pistol directly at tony. on the table is a bag of what we must believe is coke, it's open, and charlie has it all over his nose.}
<C>__{tony }
<D>__{you silly fucker, you can't go running off with other people's gear. how much you put up your nose?}
<A>__{charlie opens up, he fires four shots straight into tony who buckles and falls to the floor. tony seems only shaken and he holds his hands out to inspect them, he's bleeding.}
<C>__{tony }
<D>__{oh you silly cunt.}
<A>__{tony stands and walks towards charlie. charlie is understandably shocked and fires another. it goes straight through tony and we see the blood hit the wall behind.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{go down boy, go down.}
<A>__{tony keeps going for him. charlie raises the gun and points it at tony's face and fires the last shot. the bullet goes straight into his mouth but it went in at an angle and it exits his cheek. tony is standing there with six. bullet holes in him and bleeding all over the carpet. as he talks blood courses its way down his front and a strong lisp is frustrating the words.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{ohh you'f in twouble nowf.}
<A>__{tony slowly extracts a short sword from behind him. fear has set into charlie's face and has rendered him useless.}
