<C>__{edward}
<D>__{don't worry. you're human. time heals all wounds for your kind. particularly if you're not reminded.}

<C>__{bella}
<D>__{no, this is don't do this. please.}
<A>__{he sees she won't let go easily. takes a breath. his face turns cold again.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{try to understand. every second with you is about restrainterior you're too fragile. i'm tired of pretending to be something i'm not. reining myself in so i can be with a human.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{then take my soul. i don't care! i don't want it without you }
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{ you're not good for me, bella.}
<A>__{bella looks at him. his hard face. his resolve.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i've let it go on too long. i'm sorry.}
<A>__{tears sting bella's eyes. this can't be happening. he steps forward... kisses her forehead. she closes her eyes.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{i promise, it will be like i never existed. goodbye, bella.}
<A>__{and here, for the first time, we see how truly agonizing this really is for edward. but bella doesn't see. by the time she opens her eyes he's gone. she spins }
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{ wait }
<A>__{she sees a leaf flittering to the ground where he grazed a branch; the only indication of his direction. she hurries down the path, then runs }
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{edward?!}
<A>__{ and she keeps running, going deeper into the woods... a series of quick, surreal shots time lapsing bella runs through the woods, searching, reminiscent of her opening dream. it gets darker and darker, until we're deep into night hear bella's sharp desperate breaths bella trips. falls to the damp forest floor. she looks up, the trees spinning around her... stay on bella night as hours pass she remains on the ground. curls into a ball. darkness shrouding her. devastation paralyzing her. ecu on her face numb. hear the faint sound of her name being called in the distance. a search party. she's too wrecked to respond. rain begins to pour; she doesn't register it.... series of scenes end on bella, lying there, dazed. she begins to hear an animal snuffling. it gets closer. it sounds large. scary. then she hears a whisper }
<C>__{edward }
<D>__{move, bella.}
<A>__{she lifts her head, looks for edward... but sees something else instead bella's pov a dark shape, huge, black. nearing. its eyes reflect light for a split second; they're inhuman, savage. bella, terrified, manages to drag herself to a cluster of trees. she squeezes between them. breathing hard. she closes her eyes, trying to disappear...}
