<A>__{a tough looking black man named holdaway, who sports a malcom x beard, a green chairman mao cap with a red star on it, and a military flack jacket, digs into a denny bacon, cheese and avocado burger. he sits in a booth all alone. he's waiting for somebody. as he waits, he practically empties an entire bottle of ketchup on his french fries, not by mistake either that's just how he likes it. we see mr. orange, now known as freddy newendyke, wearing a high school letterman jacket, enter the coffee shop, spot holdaway, and head his way. holdaway sees freddy bop towards him with a wide ass alligator grin plastered across his face. camera dollies fast down aisle to medium shot of holdaway. we fear freddy off screen.}
