<A>__{joseph kony and his lord's resistance army continue their reign of terror in sudan and northern uganda. amnesty international estimates that kony and the lra are responsible for over 400,000 murders and more than 40,000 child abductions. these children are tortured, raped, sold into sex slavery, and forced to take part in ritualized killing by lra commanders. the islamic government of sudan continues to provide weapons and safe haven to kony and the lra as part of a deal to wage a proxy war against the predominately christian south. without pressure from the united states, this support will continue and more innocent children will be slaughtered. now you know. as of 2011, sam childers has rescued over 800 children from the lra. his `angels of east africa orphanage' is home to more than 300 orphans, and feeds over 1200 meals a day to neighboring villagers in need.}
