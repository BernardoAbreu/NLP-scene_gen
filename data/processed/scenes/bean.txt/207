<L>__{interior inner sanctum. whistler room day.}
<A>__{bean gets back to the right rooms and closes the door desperately behind him. he stands frozen for a second and at that moment, a hand tries the door. bean leaps at it and stops. the handle turning. then there's a knock. bean moves the big table in front of the door he's barricading himself in. there's a famous rodin sculpture in there he shoves it along to block, the door as well. when he's succeeded, he leans hot and sweaty against it and a door on the other side of the room calmly opens and .... david walks in.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{seems to be a problem with the door.(pause) where's the picture gone?}
<C>__{bean}
<D>__{ahm.....}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what? what?}
<A>__{pause. pause. bean finally shows it. not a pretty sight.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{oh jesus. oh god. oh jesus god. oh mary mother of jesus. oh jesus of nazareth.}
<C>__{bean}
<D>__{oh dear.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what happened?!!!}
<C>__{bean}
<D>__{ahm.... (setting himself up for an interesting, comprehensive answer).}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{don't bother (panicking) oh my god.....}
<A>__{he rushes to the door he just came in and locks it.}
<D>__{wait a minute why am i worrying about this? i did it. i just go out and tell them what happened you're a madman from england and you did this terrible thing and it's not my fault. that's right, isn't it?}
<A>__{bean nods, knowing he deserves his doom.}
<D>__{perfect and then they say who left him alone with the picture?" and i say "me". and they say "you're fired". and i say ' right'. and so i get fired and you go to jail and no one's any happier.}
<A>__{bean shakes his head.}
<D>__{and then they say, "firing david isn't enough let's prosecute him for negligence. and they prosecute me and it turns out i was negligent and i go to jail, and my wife leaves me and my daughter becomes a prostitute and i end up on death row sharing a cell with butch mcdick, the infamous gay rapist or worse, i end up in the same cell as you!}
<A>__{bean looks hurt.}
<D>__{no, no...now, let's just be calm let's think about this calmly.}
<P>__{(he tries and fails ... ) oh godigodigod! okay, now wait.}
<D>__{let's have another look at it.}
<A>__{bean shows it to him.}
<D>__{jesus!!! i'm already thinking back to 5 minutes ago as paradise. 5 minutes ago just walking along, shooting the breeze with my old pal bernie.}
<A>__{bean then he has a brilliant idea. he hangs the painting back up in the security cupboard and closes the doors. then he removes from his pocket a small note book. he scribbles something on it, tears the page out, licks it and sticks it on the cupboard door. it reads `out of order'.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{brilliant. brilliant. problem solved!}
<A>__{bean is delighted.}
<D>__{apart from the tiny drawback that the first person who opens the cupboard will say "look, someone's totally destroyed whistler's mother let's kill them".}
<A>__{bean is less delighted.}
<D>__{no the most important thing is tbat no one sees it. ever again!}
<A>__{he locks the cupboard with his plastic card key }
<D>__{that's the first thing. then ... that's the first thing.... next ... next is the next thing which is... obviously... ritual suicide. look, let's get out of here. try to act natural.}
<A>__{the let themselves out and go into the corridor bean acting his version of `natural' very liquid.}
