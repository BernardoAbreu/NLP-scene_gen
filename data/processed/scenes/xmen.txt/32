<L>__{interior hallway day}
<A>__{logan comes out into an empty hall. strange. deathly quiet. it is very sparse and modern, matching the lab we have just left. logan runs and goes through the first door he comes to, to keep jean from seeing where he has gone.}
<L>__{interior ready room day}
<A>__{he looks around and sees he is in some sort of locker room. a row of lockers run along one side of the wall. and hanging from the other side in a row, are uniforms, much like the ones cyclops and storm were wearing in the snow. he starts to rummage through the lockers, coming up with a shirt and pants that almost fit. a pair of sneakers as well. he hears the sound of approaching foot steps coming from the hallway. he spots another entrance on the far side of the room and, carrying his clothes, he staggers out, still in considerable pain.}
