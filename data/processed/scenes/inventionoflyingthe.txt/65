<L>__{interior mark's apartment day}
<A>__{mark goes to his fridge and pulls out a beer. his mind is reeling. as he opens a drawer to get a bottle opener he sees the letter: "my invention". mark eyes it ominously. the phone rings. mark screens the call.}

<P>__{(leaving message)}
<D>__{you've been gone for twenty minutes and i turn on the t.v to see you on every station. what's going on? this is seriously the weirdest thing...}

<D>__{they're saying that you know something different about what happens after you die.}
<A>__{mark walks into his bedroom and turns on the tv. sure enough there's a newscaster on his lawn, giving a report, with a banner on the screen that reads, "new death discoveries".}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{hold on.}
<A>__{mark puts down the phone and listens to the t.v.}
<C>__{reporter }
<D>__{twenty four hours ago, mark bellison was just your typical nobody writer. reporter (on t.v) (cont'd) today, people are saying he knows new information about what happens after you die.}

<C>__{mark}
