<L>__{exterior 12th street early morning}
<A>__{larry dropping frank off at the corner of first and sixteenth, driving on. it is as if the sun has risen on a different city, different from the one which frank drove through the night before: a city of crumbling neighborhoods laid bare by sunlight; a city of day people, getting up, having breakfast, going to work.}

<A>__{time dissolves: frank paces the room. pours himself another drink.}
<D>__{frank (v.o.) (cont'd) you wonder if you've become immortal, as if you saved your own life as well. what was once criminal and happenstance suddenly makes sense. god has passed through you, why deny it, that for a moment there, god was you.}
<A>__{time dissolve: window is closed. frank tosses in his sleep. nightstand alarm buzzes. frank sits up, looks at the clock. stretching his neck, he walks over to the sink, runs water on his hands and face.}
