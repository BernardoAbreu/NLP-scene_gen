<L>__{interior different corridor lower floor day}
<A>__{a darker, even grimmer area. heavy grids over the lights. distant slammings and faint, hoarse shouts. they walk briskly.}
<C>__{chilton}
<D>__{do not reach through the bars, do not touch the bars. you pass him nothing but soft paper no pens or pencils. no staples or paperclips in his paper. use the sliding food carrier, no exceptions. do not accept anything he attempts to hold out to you. do you understand me?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{i understand.}
<C>__{chilton}
<D>__{i'm going to show you why we insist on such precautions... on the afternoon of july 8, 1981, he complained of chest pains and was taken to the dispensary. his mouthpiece and restraints were removed for an ekg. when the nurse bent over him, he did this to her...}
<A>__{he hands clarice a small, dog eared photo. looking at it, she is stopped in her tracks. this pleases chilton.}
<C>__{chilton}
<D>__{the doctors managed to re set her jaw, more or less, and save one of her eyes. his pulse never got over eighty five, even when he ate her tongue.}
<P>__{(pauses, he smiles)}
<D>__{i keep him in here.}
<A>__{he turns, pushes a button. a steel door buzzes slowly open, and barney a big, impassive orderly awaits them in an anteroom. on its walls: restraints, mouthpieces, mace, tranquilizer guns.}
<C>__{clarice}
<P>__{(quickly blocking him)}
<D>__{dr. chilton if lecter feels you're his enemy as you've said then maybe i will have more luck by myself. what do you think?}
<C>__{chilton}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{you might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{but then i would've missed the pleasure of your company.}
<A>__{she holds out the photo. a beat. he grabs it, jaw twitching.}
<C>__{chilton}
<D>__{when she's finished, bring her out.}
<A>__{he turns on his heel, goes. barney smiles reassuringly.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{hi, i'm barney. he told you, don't get near the bars?}
<C>__{clarice}
<P>__{(shaking his hand)}
<D>__{clarice starling. yes, he did.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{okay. past the others, it's the last cell. stay to the middle. i put out a chair for you.}
<A>__{sensing her tension, he indicates a nearby security monitor.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{i'm watching. you'll do fine.}
<A>__{clarice nods gratefully. she looks down the long corridor, takes a deep breath, walks into it. he watches her go.}
