<T>__{fade out:}
<L>__{interior the kid's house day}
<A>__{after a long beat, willie's voice:}
<C>__{willie }
<D>__{dear kid. i hope that you got my present and that there wasn't too much blood on it, although there was blood on the present you gave me which didn't keep me from enjoying it, so maybe the blood doesn't matter so much i guess.}
<A>__{we are fading in on a shelf in the kid's bedroom where the stuffed elephant sits, in a place of honor, its fur indeed stiff and stained with dried blood. the kid's bedroom is no longer in disarray, things are neat and comfy. we pan off of it to find this letter, crudely handwritten, tacked up on a little bulletin board.}
<C>__{willie }
<D>__{...anyway, just in case they took it as evidence i am also sending you a t shirt. i hope it's the right size. i am healing up good and they tell me that i will soon be one hundred percent even with eight bullets dug out of me because they didn't hit any vital organs, just my liver which is fucked anyway, ha ha ha. anyways...}
<A>__{our continuing pan brings us to the open door of the bedroom and we hear the sound of the tv in the living room. we track toward it.}
<C>__{willie }
<D>__{...thank you for giving that letter to the cops. i forgot i asked you to do it but it's a good thing you did or santa's little helper would've plugged his ass. and now the cops know i wrote it, which is gonna keep my ass out of jail. that, plus everyone agreeing that the phoenix police department shooting an unarmed santa was even more fucked up than rodney king. the cops are treating me like fucking royalty now which is new in my experience. they are gonna make me a sensitivity counselor so that tragedies like this will never again embarrass the whole fucking department. whatever.}
<A>__{grandma is in the living room watching tv. we track past her towards the jacuzzi area.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{...as for my little helper, i am sorry to have to tell you that him and his prune faced mail order wife are gonna be exploring mountains with your dad. i hope your dad doesn't go sucking shit from them like i did. meanwhile, i told the cops you had no one to take the fuck care of you, so they set it up with mrs. santa's sister watching you till your dad gets back in one year and three months. they made her a guardian pro temp or some such shit... anyway, she makes better money than bartending and seems to like you and your house and jacuzzi.}
<A>__{sue is in a towel, holding a highball as she climbs out of the jacuzzi. the kid walks by her carrying a bucket. she tousles his hair affectionately as he goes by. he's never looked better. we track towards the foyer. it's empty but the front door is open. we track towards it. we go out the front door...}
<C>__{willie }
<D>__{...so i will be staying in phoenix now, telling the police how screwed up they are which is not a bad job as jobs go. they're supposed to let me out of this hospital room soon so i will see you when i come over to fuck mrs. santa's sister in the jacuzzi. until then, don't take no shit from nobody. least of all yourself. anyways... see ya soon...}
<A>__{the kid is dipping a toilet bowl brush into a bucket of soapy water on the front stoop.}
<C>__{willie }
<D>__{...santa.}
<A>__{as the kid turns and hunkers down to scrub the dried blood off the stoop, we see the back of his t shirt. shit happens}
<B>__{when you party naked.}
