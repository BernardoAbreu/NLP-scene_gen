<L>__{exterior islet beach day}
<A>__{close on: the surf line. elizabeth's feet leave prints in the sand ... and then meet up with matching footprints she made earlier, going in the same direction. she has walked all the way around the island.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{not all that big, is it?}
<A>__{jack lays on the beach. he has dismantled his pistol; the parts, ball and powder dry on his scarf.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{has it changed since the last time you were here?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{the trees are taller.}
<A>__{jack checks to see if the pistol parts are dry; they are. he sets about re assembling and loading his pistol.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{i hope you have no intention of using that.}
<A>__{jack has finished putting his pistol back together. he shoves it in his belt, walks off.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{not yet. ask me again in a few weeks.}
<A>__{elizabeth can't believe it.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{captain sparrow! we have to get off this island immediately!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{don't be thinking i'm not already working on it.}
<A>__{he climbs up toward a clump of palm trees. digs for something beneath the sand. he finds it: a large iron ring.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{what is that? is there a boat under there?}
<A>__{jack heaves the trap door up and over, revealing a pit. inside are barrels and bottles of rum ... all covered with dust and cobwebs, long abandoned. jack's face falls.}
<C>__{elizabeth }
<D>__{what? what's wrong? how will this help us get off the island?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it won't. it won't, and so we won't.}
<A>__{he jumps down into the pit, cracks open a bottle of rum,. takes a swig.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{but ... you did it before! last time }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{last time, i was here a grand total of three days. last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and i bartered passage off.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{but from the looks of this, they've long been'out of business, and so that won't be happening again.}
<P>__{(takes another swig)}
<D>__{we probably have your friend norrington to thank for that.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{so that's it? that's the secret grand adventure of the infamous jack sparrow? you spent three days on the beach drinking rum?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{welcome to the caribbean, love.}
<A>__{he gathers up a few bottles, heads for the beach.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{you should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the lord. we've got some food on the trees, thank the lord again. and we've got rum, praise the lord. we can stay alive a month, maybe more. keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{a month? will doesn't have a month! we've got to do something to help him!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you're right.}
<P>__{(hoists the bottle)}
<D>__{here's luck to you, will turner.}
<A>__{he drinks and defiantly returns elizabeth's angry gaze. but then turns away, sits down.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{don't be thinking i'm happy about this, elizabeth. but i see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which i can do nothing about.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{not when you can drink instead, at least.}
<A>__{jack tosses her a bottle.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{try it. it goes down rough, but it goes down and the second swig goes down easier.}
<A>__{elizabeth considers. comes to a decision. she unseals the bottle, takes a swig. they sit in silence for a bit.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{and you will call me miss swann.}
<A>__{jack toasts her: you got it. elizabeth studies her bottle... gives jack a sidelong glance. back to her bottle}
<B>__{...}
<C>__{elizabeth }
<P>__{(under her breath)}
<D>__{drink up me hearties, yo ho...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what? what was that?}
<P>__{(elizabeth smiles)}
<D>__{something funny, miss swann? share. please,}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{nothing ... it's nothing. just ... i'm reminded of a song i learned as a child. a song about pirates.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i know a lot of songs about pirates, but none i'd teach a child. let's hear it.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{oh, no ... it's silly. back in england we didn't know a thing about pirates, really. they seemed so romantic and daring }
<A>__{jack likes the way that sounds.}
<C>__{elizabeth }
<P>__{(looks at him)}
<D>__{that was before i met one, of course.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{now i must hear this song. an authentic pirate song. have at it.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, i might ...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{more to drink!}
<A>__{he gathers two more bottles, tosses one to her. she drops her half finished bottle to catch it. opens it, takes a sip.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{well?}
<A>__{elizabeth clears her throat, begins to sing self consciously, becoming stronger as she goes on.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{we pillage, we plunder, we rifle, we loot, drink up me hearties, yo ho.}
<A>__{she gestures for him to drink. he does.}
<C>__{elizabeth }
<D>__{we kidnap and ravage and we don't give a hoot, drink up me hearties, yo ho }
