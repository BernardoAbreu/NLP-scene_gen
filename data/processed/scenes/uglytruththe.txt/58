<A>__{abby is getting a citation from a self righteous police}
<B>__{officer.}
<C>__{police officer}
<D>__{this is a family place, ma'am. not an open air hand job palace.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i understand, officer.}
<C>__{police officer}
<D>__{you want to pull those kind of stunts, you do it at home. or in the backseat of a car, like moral upstanding people do.}
<A>__{he hands her a ticket and walks off.}
<L>__{exterior abby's condo night}
<A>__{colin walks a defeated abby to her door. nearby, mike watches this, unseen and impassive.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{well, i can't say it was boring.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{that was pretty much the all time worst first date ever.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{gee, thanks.}
<A>__{mike looks worried.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(to abby)}
<D>__{where are you going with this? no guy wants to hear that!}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{no, no, i take full responsibility. so...}
<P>__{(sticking out her hand)}
<D>__{...thanks.}
<P>__{(as he shakes her hand)}
<D>__{but, hey, at least your pants are clean.}
<A>__{he smiles, amused.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{you're not what i'm used to.}
<C>__{abby}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{i know...}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{actually, that's a good thing. i'm used to women i can figure out in five seconds. i can't do that with you.}
<A>__{mike rolls his eyes.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{he's an idiot. i figured you out in two.}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{now tell him good night and stick your tits out. we're going to give this one last shot.}
<C>__{abby}
<P>__{(sticking her tits out)}
<D>__{good night.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{...and walk away.}
<A>__{she starts to walk away when colin stops her, grabbing her arm and pulling her in for a kiss.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{that definitely made up for my wet crotch.}
<C>__{abby}
<P>__{(dreamily)}
<D>__{me, too.}
<P>__{(off his look; realizing)}
<D>__{just scratch that.}
<A>__{colin gives a wave and walks toward his condo. abby pretends to enter her house until she sees colin close his front door. then, she turns around and rushes over to mike. she throws her arms around him, embracing him.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{you did it! you did it!}
<A>__{mike pulls back, a little uncomfortable.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i didn't do anything. it was you. don't ask me why, but i think he likes you.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{he's really a great guy, isn't he?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{yeah, he's dreamy.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{and he fits all ten criteria on my checklist!}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{right...weren't items one through nine something to do with him pretty much being gay?}
<A>__{abby puts her key in the door.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i'm going to ignore that because i'm in a very good mood.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{yeah, i heard, wet crotch.}
<A>__{abby rolls her eyes with a smile and goes inside. as mike is walking away, he turns back for a moment, then keeps walking.}
