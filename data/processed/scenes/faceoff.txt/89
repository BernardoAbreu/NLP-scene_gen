<A>__{archer and dubov scale the face using the old metal boots. they climb higher and higher as... guards criss cross the catwalks and staircases below and around them oblivious. archer and dubov almost reach the next level when...}
<C>__{walton}
<D>__{there!}
<A>__{bullets smack the wall around them just as archer and dubov reach the next catwalk. archer spots the emergency exit security door at the far end. but four guards descend on them and block their way. fist fight as archer and dubov take on the attacking guards. archer heaves one down the stairs into more guards. dubov drops another over the catwalk. they continue their desperate race for the door reaching the landing. as bullets ping around them hulking dubov rips away a floor panel. he uses it as a shield as archer sparks up walton's lighter. as slugs explode into the shield archer places the flame to his thumb... and peels off the skin mold. he presses his thumb to the door's keypad. to his horror, its led reads "print unreadable." walton and guards movie in, firing at closer and closer range. dubov staggers under the fusillade of bullets. the shield is repeatedly punctured and is quickly disintegrating. archer licks his thumb, tries again. finally it reads "clearance confirmed"... the door slides open.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{let's go!}
<A>__{dubov heaves the shield at the encroaching guards but as he turns to follow... walton blows him away. archer reaches to pull dubov through, but the riddled inmate ignores the helping hand. pulling the door shut, he collapses in front of it blocking it momentarily.}
