<L>__{interior ray's trailer, bedroom night}
<A>__{ray lays down her bed and checks her cell phone for new messages: a little zero blinks at her. she listens to her own cell phone message,}
<C>__{ray's voice}
<D>__{hi, it's me. leave a message, and maybe i will call ya back.}
<A>__{it is harsh. she erases it and tries again.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(fake cheerful)}
<D>__{hi....it's me...leave a message and i will call ya' back.}
<A>__{she plays it back. it sounds fake. she tries again.}
<C>__{ray }
<P>__{(less cheerful, forced)}
<D>__{hey, leave me a message and i will call ya' back. (under her breath) you son of a bitch.}
<A>__{she plays it back. "you son of a..." was recorded. she tries again.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{hi, it's me. i can't take the call right now, but if it's you, troy, please at least tell me you are alive, because the boys are worried about you.}
<A>__{she brings up old messages on her cell phone and listens to one.}
<C>__{troy }
<D>__{hey, i just got done here. i made two hours overtime fixing one of the snow making machines. pretty cool, huh? i will be home late. i'm gonna catch that meeting at 7:30. love you, bye.}
<A>__{ray stares across the room at a pile of troy's dirty flannel shirts. she gets up and picks up the pile to move it to the closet, but feels something hard. from a shirt pocket she pulls out a stack of used scratch cards. she throws the shirts in the closet and reaches for her cigarettes. she takes out a glossy picture of her double wide dream home, "the commodore" a gleaming pre fab structure with a landscaped yard and a family with paid for smiles. after a moment she takes the wad of cash out of her pocket and begins making stacks of fifties and twenties.}
