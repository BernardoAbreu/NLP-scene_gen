<C>__{pete }
<D>__{sir, are you referring to the fact that i was suffering from amnesia, and i've since recovered my memory?}
<L>__{interior biltmore hotel grand ballroom day}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(impatient)}
<D>__{i'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{mr. clyde, i remember everything.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{good. good.}
<P>__{(holds up a piece of paper)}
<D>__{now, i hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "bread instead of bullets club" of the university of california, los angeles, dated october 11, 1935. a copy of this paper is before you, mr. appleton. do you recognize it?}
<A>__{pete looks on the table and finds the roster. he's surprised to see it.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{yes... yes, i do.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{referring to line thirty seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{yes it does.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{mr. appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "bread instead of bullets club?"}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{mr. clyde, do you want to know what i knew then, or do you want to know what i know now? they're two different things?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{start with what you knew then.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{well, i'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{we see it. for the record, it reads "lucille angstrom." what's the point of this?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{well, that's what i knew then. or who i knew, i should say. you see, i was trying to court miss angstrom. i went to the meeting to impress her.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(slyly)}
<D>__{well, if you'd seen miss angstrom...}
<A>__{the audience laughs. doyle bangs his gavel.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{you asked for the truth. that's the truth. i had no idea what the meeting was about. i just sat through it so i could be near her. i'm sure even a majority counsel like yourself is familiar with the concept of impressing a girl.}
<A>__{the audience laughs. clyde shoots a look at doyle, who bangs his gavel.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{chamber will come to order.}
<A>__{clyde shuffles some papers and looks back at pete.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{all right, mr. appleton. that was what you knew then. what do you know now?}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(takes a deep breath)}
<D>__{well, i know that i lost my job because of one meeting i went to when i was a kid in college. i know that i've been branded a communist, which i'm not, but even if i was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a bill of rights for?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{mr. chairman, the witness is being non responsive...}
<A>__{a few members of the audience applaud. as pete speaks, their numbers grow.}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(passionately)}
<D>__{i know that a lot of good, honest, decent people, people that i consider my true friends, feel betrayed by me, not because of who and what i am, but because of what you say i am! i know that i...}
<A>__{doyle bangs his gavel several times. pete stops and the room falls quiet.}
<C>__{doyle}
<P>__{(emphatically)}
<D>__{mr. appleton, you will respond to the questions of this committee without elaboration or speechmaking, or the chair will find you in contempt of congress. you will not be warned again, is that clear?}
<P>__{(he lets this sink in, then)}
<D>__{continue, mr. clyde.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(looking down at his desk)}
<D>__{mr. appleton...}
<A>__{clyde takes a long pause for effect, then looks up at pete.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(holding up the roster)}
<D>__{are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i'm not refuting anything.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{yet you're contradicting yourself. you earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now nor ever a member of the communist party.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{that's not a contradiction at all, sir. i went to the meeting, but i didn't go as a member.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{well, then, as what did you go?}
<A>__{beat. pete smiles.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i'm a little hesitant to say.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{the witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee, as long as it's the truth.}
<A>__{pete shifts in his chair, then leans into the microphone.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{well, i went as... a horny young man.}
<A>__{the chamber erupts in laughter. even the other committee members are laughing, except clyde and doyle, who bangs his gavel vigorously.}
