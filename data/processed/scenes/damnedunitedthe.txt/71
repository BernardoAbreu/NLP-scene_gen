<L>__{exterior training ground derby day (1972)}
<A>__{clough is working a session with the derby players. a car screeches into the car park behind. a red faced, apoplectic sam longson gets out..}
<C>__{uncle sam}
<D>__{a hundred and seventy grand?!? for colin fucking todd?!?}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{correction, the almighty colin todd. the best technical footballer in the country.}
<C>__{uncle sam}
<D>__{a salary of three hundred quid a week? you can't pay a footballer that!!}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{that's the way things are going, uncle sam. football's all about money now.}
<C>__{uncle sam}
<D>__{i told you never to go over my head again.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{had no choice. windows opened up. you were in the bloody west indies.}
<C>__{uncle sam}
<D>__{windows? you mean there were others?!?}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{messrs. gemmell and hennessy.}
<A>__{two players turn and wave to longson..}
<D>__{gemmell hennessy afternoon! hello!}
<C>__{uncle sam}
<P>__{(eyes popping apoplectic)}
<D>__{for fucks sake!}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{let me ask you a question, uncle sam. what did you come into football for?}
<C>__{uncle sam}
<D>__{to support the football club in my home town. the club i've supported all my life.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{well, i'm sure we all admire your loyalty...}
<C>__{uncle sam}
<D>__{what i didn't come into it for was to be lectured by a cocky little twat from the north east.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{but the way i see it, there's no point being in this game unless you want to beat the best, and be the best, and that's all the people of derby want. to see their team on top of the tree, derby, derby uber alles, and if it's really their interest you have at heart, not just impressing your friends in the director's box, i suggest you keep your eyes on your road haulage business, keep your opinions to yourself and start signing some fucking cheques, there's a good lad. leave the running of this football club to the professionals.}
<C>__{uncle sam}
<D>__{but professionals don't run the club, brian, the chairman does. and if it's true, that football is all about money, and that's the way it's going, that's suits us chairmen just fucking fine..because we're the ones who've got it.}
<A>__{sam longson lights a cigar, and walks off.}
