<L>__{exterior barnell mobile home driveway morning}
<A>__{paul, looking like a man who recently took a beating, shovels the light snow cover that blankets the drive. he looks as ted's car pulls up. as ted walks toward him...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{mr. watters. you said on the phone something about a resolution in our claim?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{mr. barnell. why are you staying out here?}
<A>__{paul thinks about this for a long time. then, finally...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{my wife and i, we're having some problems.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{kind of understandable i guess. seeing as how you killed that man and dumped his body out in the woods.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you mean raymond?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{no. not raymond. definitely not raymond. i thought it was at first, but that's what was throwing me...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i'm not sure i appreciate your tone.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{my tone, mr. barnell? you are going to jail. i will personally see to that.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i really think you should go now.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you are a liar and thief.}
<A>__{paul stabs his shovel into a snow bank, then walks to ted.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you know mr. watters, i've had a pretty rough night, so if you wouldn't mind just leaving.}
<A>__{paul tries to guide ted away, but slips and falls on the snow. ted, rolling his eyes, reaches down to help him up.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(noticing the bruises)}
<D>__{hey. how'd you get all cut up?}
<C>__{mrs. wherry }
<D>__{what's say you just move away from him.}
<A>__{ted, with his hands still on paul, turns to see mrs. wherry, from her porch, a compound bow aimed at his forehead.}
<C>__{mrs. wherry }
<D>__{you all right there, paul?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i'm fine, mrs. wherry. just go back inside.}
<C>__{mrs. wherry}
<D>__{i can drop him if you want.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i'm fine. really.}
<P>__{(turning to watters)}
<D>__{i think you'd better go.}
<A>__{ted backs to his car, gets in and drives off. paul brushes the snow from his jacket, reaches up, touches his bleeding forehead (the fall having reopened the wound).}
<C>__{mrs. wherry}
<D>__{i've got some fishing line if you want me to stitch that.}
<A>__{paul waves her off, then stares at the blood on his fingertips. an idea slowly takes hold.}
