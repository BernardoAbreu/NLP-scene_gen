<L>__{exterior siwash lake day}
<A>__{delores del ruby appears from the reeds at siwash lake's edge, asleep yet awake. she has sunk so deep into the hole in her mind that gale and dust could not follow her. as she approaches the cowgirl camp, they gather around her}
<B>__{in a tight circle.}
<A>__{many are transfixed as they listen.}
<C>__{delores}
<D>__{it is woman's mission to destroy as well as to give birth. we will destroy the tyranny of the dull. but we can't destroy it with guns. or whips. violence is the dullard's breakfast of champions and the logical end product of his or her misplaced pride. violence fertilizes that which we would starve. no, we will destroy the enemy in other ways. the peyote mother has promised a fourth vision. but it won't come to me alone. it will come to each of you, to every cowgirl in the land, when you have overcome that in your own self which is dull. the fourth vision will come to some men too. you will recognize them when you meet them, and be their steady sidekicks in equal and ecstatic escapades of poetic behavior and romance.}
<A>__{delores holds up a card. the prairie moon illuminates its tattered edges. it is the jack of hearts. the forewoman seems to be tiring. fumes of weariness stream from her black hair. her voice is leaning against the wall of her larynx when she says:}
<C>__{delores}
<D>__{first thing, you must end this business with the government and the cranes. it's been positive and fruitful, but it's gone far enough. playfulness ceases to serve a serious purpose when it takes itself too seriously. sorry i won't be with you at the conclusion. as you know, i've been sick and stupid for a long time. i have a lot to make up for, a lot to accomplish, and there's someone important that i've got to see. now.}
<A>__{as graceful as a ballet for cobras, delores turns and walks away into the night.}
