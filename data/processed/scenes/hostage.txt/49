<D>__{if my father dies they'll charge you with his murder. can't you make dennis see that?}
<A>__{kevin leans back. he knows she's right, but he doesn't believe he can do anything about it }

<A>__{a shadow moves behind kevin. it's mars, standing in the door. he holds up a wicked claw hammer }
<C>__{mars}
<D>__{look what i found.}
<A>__{he enters and tests at jennifer's binds }
<C>__{mars }
<D>__{you tied her like a pussy. make it tight.}
<A>__{as kevin reties the bindings, mars rips the phone from the wall. he smashes the phone jack with the hammer, crushing it. then he goes to the window and drives a heavy nail into the sill, nailing the window closed mars returns to jennifer and once more checks her binds }
<C>__{mars }
<D>__{better.}
<A>__{he tears off a strip of duct tape and presses it over her mouth }
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{make sure she can breathe.}

<C>__{mars}
<D>__{go downstairs, kevin.}
<A>__{jennifer looks at kevin, her eyes pleading that he not leave, but kevin is cowed; he leaves jennifer looks back at mars mars leans close to her. she is terrified that he is going to kiss her, but, instead, he sniffs, smelling her }
<C>__{mars }
<D>__{i want to show you something.}
<A>__{mars hooks the claw hammer under his shirt and lifts to expose his chest. a large tattoo in flowing script is lined across his body: a mother's son.}
<C>__{mars }
<D>__{it cost two hundred forty dollars, but i was happy to spend it. i love my mom. you see these?}
<A>__{mars points out hard gray knots that speckle his chest as if he were diseased. he fingers the lumps sensuously as if touching them excites him }
<C>__{mars }
<D>__{my mom burned me with cigarettes.}
<A>__{jennifer is both disgusted and terrified. mars stares at her emptily for another moment, then lowers his shirt and leaves without another word.}
