<A>__{dr. copper and macready begin dumping the heavy contents of a large plastic trash bag onto the slab.}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<D>__{we found this.}
<A>__{displayed on the slab is what appears to be the corpse of a man. badly charred. what is left of the trousers and shoes of the bottom torso are ripped and split, as if his legs and feet had burst from the inside. his upper body is an almost undecipherable gnarled mass of protoplasmic mush. the head is strangely disfigured and looks larger than normal. it is situated not on its shoulders but near the abdomen. tendon like appendages are wrapped around the carcass and sticking up and out in odd postures. one is wrapped around the body's left leg. the shirt has been ripped and lies shredded in the tar like mess. the men grimace.}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<D>__{i know he's pretty badly burned... but could fire have done this?}
<A>__{blair, sickened but fascinated, pokes at the tendon like things and the tarry goo.}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<D>__{blair, i'd like you and fuchs to help me with autopsies on this one and the one garry shot this morning.}
