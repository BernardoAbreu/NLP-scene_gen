<A>__{through the cockpit window in the bluish glare of a work light, veterans, dressed in space suits, can be seem erecting a prefab hut on the harsh moonscape. sloan is watching them through the window while behind her rubrick lounges with his feet on the console and reads a current magazine on a vdt. church is partially visible in the background, poring over charts in the navigator's cubicle. it's very quiet until sloan speaks, almost to herself.}

<D>__{jesus! it says here macy's is going out of business. can you imagine that? new york without macy's?}
<A>__{silence. sloan watches the veterans outside through the window. they're working like a team of ants in space suits, erecting the hut. church gets up noisily from the navigation cubicle and joins them, shaking his head.}
