<D>__{holy shit, that's live fire!}
<A>__{as the helicopter comes over the clearing, styles and the pilot squint down through the windscreen to see the two men, huddled together as bullet hits kick up dust around them!}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{who's shooting at them }
<A>__{the bigger man raising his own his weapon and returning fire. the smaller man frantically waving the helicopter down...}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{i can't see }
<A>__{below, the bigger man still shooting and then he lowers his rifle and there's only silence. no return fire. and then styles sees why. a third man. lying by the treeline. chest torn open by gunfire. obviously dead. his clothes the same fatigues the first two men are wearing.}

<D>__{that was one of their own, he just shot one of their own men }
