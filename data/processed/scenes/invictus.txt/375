<A>__{every seat full. almost every seat filled by a big white man. excitement unbearable. jason stalks the runways between the seating sections, high in the stadium. binoculars around his neck, radio in hand. something catches his eye. something in the air. jason lifts his binoculars to his eyes. pov through binoculars the 747 is heading right for the stadium. jason lowers his binoculars. he frowns more puzzled than alarmed. (this is pre 9 11.) he lifts his radio to his mouth.}
