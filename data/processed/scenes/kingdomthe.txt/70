<L>__{interior al rahmah community center next moment}
<A>__{florescent lights make it ugly. haytham dumps duffel bags by their bunks, sang stack steel travel boxes from the paletts inside. no windows, ac cranked to `coldest.' americans sealed in in the name of comfort. janet's area made obvious with a floral partition. she immediately folds it, puts it into a corner. haytham watches her undo his work.}
<D>__{colonel al ghazi the bathrooms are through that door. i will be here tomorrow morning so we can begin.}
<C>__{fleury}
<D>__{what time tomorrow morning? colonel al ghazi sunrise.}

<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{when i knock.}
<A>__{al ghazi and haytham leave. the doors close behind them, then the sound of a key turning in a lock. the americans look on, half disbelief, half comedy: locking us in.}
<C>__{grant sykes}
<D>__{that's against fire code.}
<C>__{janet mayes}
<D>__{they don't have fire codes. they don't have codes other than codes of war. they'll lock us in and dial up some kind of earth movers if they want to. you know that, sykes. dig a big hole and push us in. fill it up and no one comes calling. you're in the jungle now, baby.}
<A>__{silence as the crew digests this odd little verbal outage.}
