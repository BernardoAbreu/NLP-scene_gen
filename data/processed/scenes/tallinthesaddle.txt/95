<L>__{interior cabin night}
<A>__{close shot on a soiled and wrinkled envelope lying on a table. it is addressed to:}
<D>__{mr. rocklin c o santee ranch}
<A>__{the camera pulls back and rocklin is revealed at the table, looking down at the letter. his hat is tipped back on his head, and his sleeves are rolled up. he is mixing dough in a bowl sitting on the table near the letter, and his hands are all gooey. dave is discovered in front of the fireplace where his outer shirt and socks are drying. it is dark outside, but the storm has abated. rocklin goes to a shelf near the fireplace to get a pan.}
<C>__{dave}
<P>__{(during the above)}
<D>__{durn funny that storm quittin' just about the time i get here.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{no funnier than you sloggin' through it, just to deliver a letter from a woman.}
<C>__{dave}
<P>__{(disgustedly)}
<D>__{reckon i'm gettin' to be more of a fool the older i get.}
<A>__{dave watches rocklin at the table shaping the dough for biscuits and putting it in the pan.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{when are we gonna get around to readin' it?}
<A>__{rocklin cannot help smiling a bit at the way dave includes himself in.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{thought i'd wait till mornin' might be bad news an' i wouldn't be able to sleep.}
<A>__{dave screws up his face in utter disgust and turns his attention to his drying clothes. rocklin, meanwhile, takes a flour sack from the table, wipes the dough from his hands and picks up the letter. he goes over to the fireplace, opening the letter the while, and sits on the bench. dave, seeing this, edges discreetly around in back of rocklin in order to see over his shoulder. the letter open, rocklin takes out a roll of bills along with the folded message. he lays the envelope on the bench.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{mmmm dineroo.}
<A>__{rocklin places the money in his shirt pocket for the moment, and opens the folded message. letter. it begins with the usual dear mr. rocklin. rocklin's voice is heard over the insert as he reads from here.}
<C>__{rocklin's voice}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{forgive me if this letter is a trifle incoherent, but i am terribly worried and unhappy.}
<B>__{back to scene.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{who wouldn't be livin' with that ole screech owl.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(continues to read)}
<D>__{i am desperately in need of help and advice from someone whom i feel i can trust, and i am appealing to you, because i regard you in the same way my uncle surely must have. i heartily dislike and distrust judge garvey }
<C>__{dave}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{huh smart girl }
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(going on)}
<D>__{but my aunt seems to have suddenly revised her opinion of him, and now wants me to place all my affairs in the judge's hands and return east. such is certainly not my wish.}
<C>__{dave}
<P>__{(significantly)}
<D>__{looks kinda like she's formed an attachment.}
<A>__{rocklin glares up to dave.}
<C>__{dave}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{for the locality, i mean.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(continues reading)}
<D>__{i wanted so much to give ranch life a trial, but fear circumstances are against me, especially in view of the recent indian trouble }
<C>__{dave}
<P>__{(explosively)}
<D>__{indian trouble }
<P>__{(in normal tone)}
<D>__{good lord, they ain't been any indian trouble around here in }
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(caustically)}
<D>__{you want to hear the rest of this?}
<C>__{dave}
<P>__{(getting the inference)}
<D>__{might's well come this far.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{i want to apologize for what took place this afternoon. and i am returning the 150, because i feel it is rightfully yours. you must take it. faithfully yours, clara caldwell.}
<A>__{the letter finished, rocklin regards it a moment, then slowly returns it to the envelope as he gazes thoughtfully into the fire. dave meantime straightens up scratches his shaggy top, and turns his attention once more to his drying clothes.}
<C>__{dave}
<P>__{(feeling his socks)}
<D>__{well what do you make of it?}
<A>__{rocklin continues looking into the fire as he lays the letter back on the bench and takes out tobacco to roll a cigarette.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{somebody's sure bustin' to get her out of there.}
<A>__{dave sits alongside rocklin and begins putting on his socks.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{indian trouble }
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{wonder why the old lady's playin' along?}
<C>__{dave}

<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{you must have known him pretty well what kind of a man was he?}
<A>__{rocklin goes to the table and resumes molding biscuits. dave has his boots on and is putting on his outer shirt.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{caldwell? the best cantankerous cuss but a real cowman, believe me he was a big feller, like yourself fact, you coulda passed fer a blood relation, come to think of it.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(casually, as he busies}
<D>__{himself with the}
<P>__{biscuits)}
<D>__{was the judge and red friends?}
<C>__{dave}
<P>__{(anigmatically)}
<D>__{that's what you'd say. garvey managed all red's business. besides which they was regular drinkin' pals played poker together most nights tho' they do say red got the worst of it.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{red was a gambler, eh?}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{oh, yeah reckon a pretty poor one, tho' still you'd say him and garvey was friends.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(after a side glance to dave)}
<D>__{anything ever happen to make you think they weren't?}
<C>__{dave}
<P>__{(moves close to rocklin)}
<D>__{rock i'm gonna tell you somethin' i ain't never told anybody.}

<P>__{(with a slight smile)}
<D>__{think you can trust me?}
<A>__{dave grimaces his confidence.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{the last time i seen red was the day he died }
<A>__{in the pause rocklin remains silent.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{ 'twas in town he jus' come out of the stage office. tried to book passage to garden city but couldn't on account i had a full load. well, sir, he took me aside and give me a printed sheet of paper and says, "read it." i looked it over and fer as i could see it was a paper from one of them chicago sportin' firms, tellin' how to manipulate trick playin' cards.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{marked cards.}
<C>__{dave}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{reckon so. seems red found some cards and this paper in a coat one of his friends loaned him one night.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{whose was it?}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{well, now that's just what i asked but all he said, was that it belonged to a good friend. then he said he wasn't waitin' fer the next coach, but was ridin' over to see the district judge about it alone.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{that's when they got him.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{yes, sir 'bout a mile or so from stan's place. a bullet in the back an' his pockets empty.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{how come you never told this before?}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{who was there to tell? sheriff jackson? him an' garvey's thick as thieves.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{how about what's his name harolday? he's no friend of the judge's, is he?}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{hates his guts sure riles him to see young clint hangin' onto the judge's coattails. all the same, i jus' decided to keep my mouth shut and my eyes open.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{even if it was garvey red was talkin' about it don't follow that he killed him.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{no general opinion is that it was rustlers.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{why would rustlers take the evidence caldwell had with him?}
<A>__{rocklin moves away to a large earthen jug holding water as dave talks.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{looks to me if you get the man who owned the marked cards, you get the killer.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(drinking)}
<D>__{funny tho' first the k.c. foreman then caldwell an' now these women.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{lordy you ain't thinkin' somebody might try bumpin' them?}
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(slowly, to himself)}
<D>__{i'm not so sure somebody hasn't tried already }
<P>__{(to dave)}
<D>__{remember, when we stopped to change horses on the way over from garden city }
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{shore you told me how jackson and clews tried to frame stan.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{yeah. like they wanted to be sure he'd keep his mouth shut about something.}
<A>__{dave sits down on a box sitting against the wall, directly under the large earthen jug of water.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{and layin' that gun across my skull an' offerin' to drive the coach themselves.}
