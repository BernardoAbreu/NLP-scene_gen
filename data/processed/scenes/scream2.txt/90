<B>__{on dewey and gale}
<A>__{gale watches the screen as dewey looks around the room, searching for it's source. click! another monitor comes to life. more home shot video footage. this time of a big house. a closer look reveals it to be the chi omega sorority house. a young girl stands on the front porch talking on a portable phone. it's cici.}

<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{dammit!}
<A>__{he looks around the room, up to the two levels above them. he spots a small light on the second level. he squints his eyes and sees a figure standing behind it.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{let's go.}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{no, wait here.}
<A>__{dewey hands her his flashlight and takes off for the stair rise that leads to the upper level.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{no, dewey, let's call for backup.}
<A>__{but dewey is gone, leaving gale alone. she turns to the monitor to see her face in fear stricken closeup.}
<B>__{on the upper level}
<A>__{dewey moves fast, limping his way to the level's edge. he approaches the railing and makes his way around to the shining light. he reaches it, finding nothing but a camera and tripod. it sits alone against the railing. dewey surveys the second level. empty seats everywhere. completely bare. dewey looks down to the main floor... to gale who looks up to him.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{dewey?}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{there's nothing. i'm coming down.}
<A>__{dewey turns to leave, his eye catching a monitor that hangs level with the railing. on the monitor, gale is in frame, looking up at dewey, her face fear stained. she takes a step forward, moving out of frame, revealing}
<B>__{the ghost}
<A>__{who stands right behind her. dewey looks down to see the ghost standing directly behind gale.}
<C>__{dewey }
<D>__{watch out!}
<B>__{down below}
<A>__{gale turns just in time to see the gleam of a killer's knife as it darts out of the darkness. gale catapults, just dodging it. she moves like lightning up the aisle of seats.}
<B>__{up above}
<A>__{dewey races for the stairs, going as fast as his handicapped leg will allow.}
<B>__{down below}
<A>__{gale tears out the exit door, the killer right behind her.}
