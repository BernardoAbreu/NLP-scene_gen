<L>__{exterior balmoral castle day}
<A>__{the next morning. the royal family are picnicking in the grounds. victoria walks along a path accompanied on one side by brown, on the other by bertie. bertie is in mid plea.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop...}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{it is a disgusting habit, bertie. it should be discouraged.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{it is quite late enough.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{but mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose. it has been a smoking room by tradition ever since father }
<C>__{victoria}
<P>__{(cutting in angrily)}
<D>__{brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already. he has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. the smoking room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{mama...}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{and that is my last word on the matter.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{well, i'm sorry, but i really do think it's too much that the gentlemen of the house should be dictated to by a servant.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{it's the queen's decision.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i beg your pardon?}
<P>__{(to victoria)}
<D>__{mama...?}
<A>__{before bertie can continue, brown steps right into his face.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{i think you should go now.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you've tired your mother enough.}
<A>__{bertie stares back, too stunned to speak. he glances at his mother, but victoria looks off into the distance as if she has not heard. bertie turns and storms away.}
