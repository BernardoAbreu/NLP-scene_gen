<A>__{sarah is being lifted into the ambulance. she looks up as the doors are latched shut. tilt up to follow her gaze. the sign above the entrance of the building reads:}

<A>__{macro on cassette recorder, the center capstans of a tape turning.}
<C>__{sarah }
<D>__{...and the hardest thing is deciding what i should tell you and what not to. well, anyway, i've got a while yet before you're old enough to understand the tapes. they're more for me at this pointerior.. to help get it all straight.}
<A>__{cover shot reveals sarah as the wheel of a dusty landrover parked at the pump island of a tiny gas station. all of its signs are in hand lettered spanish. beyond lies an expanse of scrub desert. the sky scowls with an impending storm. sarah speaks quietly into a hand microphone as a dark complected attendant laconically fills her tank. she cradles the cassette recorder in her lap, in the lee of her swollen belly. she looks to be about six months along. under her down vest she wears a leather shoulder holster and the butt of a .357 revolver presses against her breast. she tugs the vest closed as the attendant glances her way. a german shepherd sits in the back among taped boxes and suitcases.}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{should i tell you about your father? that's a tough one. will it change your decision to send him here...knowing? but if you don't send kyle, you could never be. god, you can go crazy thinking about all this...i suppose i will tell you...i owe him that. and maybe it'll be enough if you know that in the few hours we had together we loved a lifetime's worth...}
<A>__{click. whir. sarah jumps at a sound nearby, breaking her reverie. a small mexican boy has snapped her picture with a beat up polaroid camera. he holds it out to her, speaking rapid spanish.}
<C>__{attendant}
<D>__{he says you are very beautiful, senora, and he is ashamed to ask five american dollars for this picture, but if he does not, his father will beat him.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{that's a pretty good hustle, kid. four. quatro.}
<A>__{the boy takes her four dollars and she watches the snapshot develop. it is a good photograph of her, the wind lightly ruffling her hair, expression thought ful, slightly sad. we recognize it as the one reese carried in 2029. she slips it into her short pocket.}
<C>__{attendant}
<D>__{mil trescientos...fifteen dollars american.}
<A>__{as she pays him, distant thunder rolls. the boy yells something in spanish as he runs off.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{what did he say?}
<C>__{attendant}
<P>__{(accented)}
<D>__{there is a storm coming in.}
<A>__{sarah gazes at the thunderheads building up out over the desert. heat lightning pulses in their depths.}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{camera cranes up as she pulls away, driving across the flat desert on a ribbon of highway. a brilliant flash crescendos from horizon to horizon out at the rim of the world.}
