<D>__{eight murders in less than a year. all of them indian. all of them unsolved. is the law a non entity out here or what?}
<A>__{cooch opens a folder that sits between them, and taking his eyes off the road for a dangerous five seconds, locates some photos, and hands them to ray. ray's expression tells us they are not pretty.}

<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you've been in the bureau for thirty years. you survived the hoov, the black panthers and abscam. i don't see any bullet holes. that's good enough for me.}
<A>__{cooch looks at ray, amused. he likes this guy. and then he notices a look of growing consternation on his partner's face. ray's pov moving as they drive through the first settlement, a little, broken and scattered community, littered with wrecked cars on blocks, and overpopulated with hungry dogs. heartbeat drum softly under. six indian children with dirty but beautiful faces and long blue black hair run alongside the car, curious. one of them yells something we don't understand. past the trading post a white man's store where six oglala sioux four men, two women sit like wax figures, only their eyes moving to light on the freshly waxed government car. a little house has a tipi erected beside it. and a satellite dish. the house beside that one has been half chopped away to feed the wood stove. poverty.}
