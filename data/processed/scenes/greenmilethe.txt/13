<L>__{interior tv room day}
<A>__{jerry springer's on the tube, whipping his studio audience into a frenzy. pan off to reveal dozens of old folks watching on couches and folding chairs. an old black fellow named pete is grousing to a group of elderly ladies...}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{why we always watch this crap? elderly lady #1 it's interesting.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{interesting? bunch'a inbred trailer trash, all they ever talk about is fucking...}
<A>__{...and we continue panning to paul and elaine sitting near the back, talking quietly as paul rubs his bruised hand:}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{we should report him.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{that might just provoke him all the more, make things worse for everybody.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{it's not everybody he has it in for, paul. it's you.}
<P>__{(off his look)}
<D>__{what did you do to provoke him in the first place? nothing. he's just an abusive bully, and should be made to stop.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{ellie, please...}
<A>__{pete is at the tv, switching channels while:}
<C>__{elderly ladies}
<D>__{...no, the movie classic channel is further down...past the home shopping...keep going...}
<A>__{he finds the movie classic channel, which is playing an old black and white musical "top hat," with fred astaire and ginger rogers. a delighted reaction:}
<D>__{elderly lady #2 oh! this is wonderful...}
<A>__{paul idly shifts his gaze to the tv...and his expression goes slack with recognition and dismay. elaine sees the look in his eyes. he glances away...even briefly considers walking out...but in the end, he can't help himself. the past just caught up with him with a freight train wallop, and, for one, he decides to ride the rails... he looks back at the tv. on screen, fred and ginger have begun their famous "cheek to cheek" number, with astaire singing in that sublime, easy go lucky way of his:}
<C>__{fred astaire}
<D>__{heaven, i'm in heaven...and my heart beat so that i can hardly speak...}
<A>__{slow push in on paul, watching. he'd like to take his eyes off the screen, but the movie has him in a grip tighter than brad dolan's. elaine is watching him with puzzled concern:}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{paul? what is it?}
<A>__{no response. all he can hear is that music, all he can see are those dancers. the figures on tv are gliding with ghostlike grace in their silvery, phosphor dot world of long ago... paul abruptly bursts into tears. the room goes quiet, everything comes to a standstill. all eyes turn, some concerned, others merely curious. paul just sits sobbing into his hands, shoulders heaving.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{paul...my god...}
<C>__{orderly}
<P>__{(rushing over)}
<D>__{what is it? what's wrong?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it's okay...i will be okay...}
<A>__{another orderly appears brad dolan. he puts his hand on paul's shoulder and leans close, feigning concern.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{s'matter, paulie? why the boo hoo hoo? something nasty happen?}
<A>__{elaine shoves his hand away, eyes flashing with anger.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{mr. edgecomb will be perfectly fine without your help, thank you.}
<A>__{brad back off with a "hey, suit yourself" gesture. elaine helps paul to his feet and leads him out.}
