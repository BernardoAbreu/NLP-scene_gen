<L>__{interior ward, alpine grove, christmas day}
<A>__{dr. lorenson walks into the ward to check on starks. the attending nurse is walking around the ward.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{where's william starks.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{i'm not sure. dr. becker had him moved.}
<L>__{interior hallway, alpine grove, day}
<A>__{dr. lorenson walks anxiously down the halls of the hospital, peering into every room, looking for starks.}
<L>__{interior another hallway, alpine grove, day}
<A>__{dr. lorenson spots becker walking out the doors of the hospital and runs after him, in only his white coat...}
<L>__{exterior parking lot, alpine grove, day (cont'd)}
<D>__{lorenson [calling out after him] dr. becker! dr. becker!...tom, wait!}
<A>__{dr. becker stops walking and waits a moment, registering the voice, before he turns around to face dr. lorenson.}
<D>__{lorenson [out of breath] where's william starks?}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{he's recovering on the third floor.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{are you kidding me? he's not psychotic!}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{then how would you describe him, beth? merely rebellious?}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{he'll be a zombie in a few days, tom. his behavior's hardly suggested he needed neuroleptics.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{and you know that from what, a couple two minute stares across a room? lorenson [firmly] he didn't need anti psychotics, if that's even all you're giving him...?}
<A>__{becker ignores lorenson's insinuation and merely turns his cheek all the way round towards lorenson so he can see the bandage from the cut s: tarks gave him.}
<D>__{becker [steadily] after he slashed me with a hospital instrument, i determined, in my professional opinion, that mr. starks, needed a little placating.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{[beat] you sure he wasn't provoked?}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{you sure you want to begin making that kind of insinuation? [beat] i took five stitches during a routine therapy session.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{i'm sure he took some, too. becker [smirking, unphased] happens sometimes when you've got to restrain them. you watch the rest of us work. you know that. lorenson [appealing to him] our patients are sick.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{yes, they are.}
<A>__{lorenson looks at becker; he knows he's hiding something.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{he's not gonna end up like casey, tom. whatever happened to him is not going to "happen" to starks. i don't know what you're trying to do here ...but he's not a lab animal, tom. you can't reprogram him no matter the drugs or the treatment.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{jesus, you really don't let up, do you? just because you failed your patient doesn't necessarily mean the rest of us did, too. [beat] sorry to tarnish your war hero's image, but he is psychotic.}
<A>__{lorenson looks back, starting to grasp becker's misshapen beliefs.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{now, if you'll excuse me, it's christmas, and i have a family i'd like to see.}
