<L>__{exterior camp day}
<A>__{hector and francisco reach dom paulo's office in the sand. the leading citizens are gathering there as the two captured deserters are brought in.}
<C>__{sailor}
<D>__{they ran off with the dry bread... about eight of them, sir...}
<A>__{dom paulo looks at the two prisoners.}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{you men are deserters. you will die tomorrow.}
<A>__{he speaks again to the sailor.}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{chain them on the raft for tonight, and watch them...}
<A>__{francisco steps forward, outraged.}
<C>__{francisco}
<D>__{i must object... these sentences can't be lawful...}
<A>__{dom paulo's authoritative manner vanishes in an instant. he becomes hesitant, unsure of himself. as always, his son watches every detail of the exchange.}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{do you think so?}
<C>__{francisco}
<D>__{of course... we can't allow ourselves to fall into terror and violence...}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{you're right... but then how can we punish them? we can't lock them up...}
<A>__{dom paulo looks around at the assembled notables, confused, out of his depth. other opinions are voiced.}
<C>__{salgado}
<D>__{you were right the first time, sir... they must hang... they were stealing the bread from our mouths...}
<A>__{the captured deserters look on helplessly as their lives are argued over.}
<C>__{young deserter}
<D>__{i didn't steal any bread... gomes had the bread... he's off, in the forest...}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{oh dear...}
<A>__{dom paulo turns to the priest.}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{what do you think, father?}
<A>__{the priest throws open his arms noncommittally.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{i will comfort them whether they live or die, now or later, any of you, all of you... i will comfort you all.}
<C>__{salgado}
<D>__{hang them... you have to set an example...}
<A>__{dom paulo is deeply confused.}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{so i was right the first time?}
<A>__{francisco confuses him even more.}
<C>__{francisco}
<D>__{no, sir... there must be proper justice...}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{what's proper justice?}
<C>__{deserter}
<D>__{i didn't steal any bread...}
<C>__{salgado}
<D>__{you have to make a decision, sir.}
<C>__{deserter}
<D>__{it was gomes... he told us to run.}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{i will decide... no i won't... we'll all decide... most of the people that matter are here... we'll have a vote... who agrees with salgado... and me... that they should die?}
<A>__{a lot of hands go up. hector hesitates, his instincts are not for killing. but the force of the majority weighs on him. he starts to raise his hand. at that moment, as he scans the crowd, he meets the eyes of the deserter whose death they are voting on. for a moment they communicate. hector is thrown. he drops his hand, only to find in the next instant the stern gaze of salgado on him. he hesitates again, then starts to raise his hand. then the eyes of the deserter find him once more. this comic pantomime goes on while a solid majority of the crowd firmly raise their hands.}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{... and those against death...}
<A>__{one of the deserters raises his own hand meekly.}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{you can't vote...}
<A>__{then he looks to salgado.}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{can he?}
<C>__{salgado}
<D>__{it doesn't matter.}
<A>__{then the other deserter raises his hand too.}
<C>__{salgado}
<D>__{i don't think this is working, dom paulo... we need authority... you must decide...}
<A>__{dom paulo thinks.}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{very well... da cunha?}
<A>__{da cunha steps forward.}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{the cross the carpenter is working on... tell him to turn it into a scaffold... have it erected along the beach, away from the women... the executions will be at sunrise tomorrow. tell father diogo.}
<A>__{he turns to the sailors holding the deserters.}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{take them to the raft.}
<A>__{the dazed deserters are led off. dom paulo's face clouds in doubt again.}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{everyone in agreement with hanging? or should we shoot them... or what?}
<C>__{da cunha}
<D>__{hanging is fine, sir.}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{very well... now... who's going to conduct the executions... should we pick someone, or have a volunteer...}
<A>__{dom paulo looks over the faces of the men. he stops at hector.}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{hector?}
<A>__{hector doesn't have the will to accept or the courage to refuse. he is saved by another young man, alvarez, eager to prove himself.}
<C>__{alvarez}
<D>__{i will do it, dom paulo.}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{thank you, alvarez. sunrise tomorrow. send the priest to them tonight.}
<A>__{we can sense the feeling of relief in hector. dom paulo's son has been a silent witness to everything that has happened, but his blank face reveals nothing of his feelings.}
