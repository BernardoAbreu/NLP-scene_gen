<A>__{blue, lynn sits on her porch watching the rain come down. a screeching on the wet street as bud's packard pulls up. she watches as he gets out and starts for the house. lynn stands, holds her arms out. bud stops short on the steps, out of reach, the rain soaking him.}

<A>__{bud backhands her, hard. lynn faces straight into the next one as bud hits her again. a third time as the sins of the father are visited on the son. bud stops short as the self realization slams home. lynn waits stoically. she doesn't start crying till bud turns and runs back into the rain.}
