<A>__{gittes in mulwray's buick whips into the driveway. he looks in the garage. evelyn's car is gone. only the gardener's truck is there. gittes hurries along the pathway and up to the house. he rings the doorbell. scarcely waiting for an answer he tries it. it's locked. he reaches into his pocket pulls out his cigarette case, takes a pick out of the side and starts to fool with the lock. the maid opens the door abruptly, stares in some surprise at gittes.}
