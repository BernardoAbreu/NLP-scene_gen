<A>__{they go to the elevators, wait with chatty card collectors [pete rose this, pete rose that]. twelfth floor. ann and john step out of the elevator, look for 1204. letour, a step behind, is all eyes, all ears. ann checks the number, rings the bell. thomas lets them in the standard issue suite, locks the door. letour was right: it's a set up. thomas and a teenage cuban stand either side of them, waistbands conspicuously bulging. no tis. john turns to ann:}
<C>__{letour}
<P>__{(jesus to judas)}
<D>__{ann.}
<A>__{ann's confused, then furious: she had no part in the "set up." in fact, she doesn't even know it's a set up. bursting rage, she turns on thomas, yells:}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{i told you greasy fucks i don't deal with guns! i see guns, i walk! how dare you?}
<A>__{she slaps thomas, pulls the 9mm from his waistband, throws it to the carpet. the cuban watches bewildered, gun drawn, awaiting instructions. now ann's on him:}

<C>__{ann}
<P>__{(out of shot)}
<D>__{fire! fire! fire!}
<A>__{the fire bell rings. thomas, tis, and the cuban stare dumbfounded. letour reaches behind his shirt in the confusion, yanks out the .38 with a painful rip, turning, fires point blank into the cuban's chest. blam! shirt fabric flares, flies: the cuban falls with blank expression. thomas, off guard, wheels and fires wildly at letour. john fires back. both are hit. tis ducks into the bedroom. thomas and letour fire again, again hitting, missing. a bullet hits its mark: thomas, frozen, grabs his blood spurting throat, slumps to floor. letour bleeds from the stomach and shoulder. his shirt soaks red; he struggles to stand. cuban and thomas both dead. letour checks the .38: five rounds fired one left. letour staggers into the bedroom, finds tis frantically searching an open suitcase. off screen voices under the fire bell.}
<C>__{tis}
<P>__{(desperate)}
<D>__{i didn't }
<A>__{letour steps to tis, aims, shoots him barrel to forehead. exit debris hits the wall. he is dead. off screen screams of guests are countered by commands from hotel security: "get down!" "get back!" fire horns and sirens reverb from the street. letour, losing consciousness, sits bedside. gun slips from his hand. deflating, he drifts back first to the bedspread. blood spreads. his eyes are open. police voices approach.}
