<L>__{exterior zoo grounds pinata area that moment}
<A>__{the partygoers are lined up under the gigantic stanley shaped pinata, which is hanging from a tree. a tubby banker in a blindfold takes a good hard whack. cracks are beginning to appear...}
<D>__{stu bone okay, folks, it's pinata time you know the rules five bucks a pop and remember, it's all for the benefit of our friends the animals!}
<P>__{(eyes brightening)}
<D>__{oooooh! this one's on me!}
<A>__{the next contestant is a gorgeous woman. he blindfolds her and embraces her from behind to help her with her grip on the bat.}
<D>__{stu bone choke up, baby. that's right. choke up!}
<A>__{suddenly he notices the cops marching up with julie, o.d. stu and co. in tow. he freezes, terrified backs away from the babe and catches a bat in the face. several people rush up to help him as the cops consult with the benefit organizers...}
<C>__{organizer}
<D>__{i don't understand, officer. this is a benefit. surely this can wait until }
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{sorry, ma'am...we need to question mr. miley on a most urgent matter.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{stop this. now. those dolls have been tampered with. they're toxic!}
<A>__{o.d. stu comes marching through the crowd. he passes a life sized display of stanley and monkeybone...grabs the backpack off the stanley figure...and proceeds deliberately toward stu bone.}
<C>__{o.d. stu}
<D>__{monkeybone... back in the pack.}
<A>__{the old command seems to retain its magical power, because stu bone clutches his gut as if stricken at the sound of it.}
<C>__{o.d. stu}
<D>__{i mean it this time. back in the pack.}
<A>__{stu bone bends over jerks and twitches becoming more simian by the moment as o.d. stu approaches.}
<D>__{stu bone stu...i can explain...i was sick of being a figment, see? it's awful being a figment. it's degrading! and i never really wanted to give people nightmares. i just told 'em that so they'd help me get a body.}
<C>__{o.d. stu}
<D>__{yeah my body. back in the pack, you simian shitbird!}
<A>__{the cops are tres confused by all this }
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{ma'am, can you give me some idea of what's going on here?}
<A>__{ but julie holds them back so the scene can play itself out. now stu bone is doing a weird little monkey dance playing up to the puzzled crowd, who laugh and snicker, wondering what to make of all this.}
<D>__{stu bone laugh, damn you...laugh at the sidekick...the happy little monkey. he doesn't have any feelings. he's just a figment of your immagination!}
<A>__{he turns suddenly grabs the bat from the puzzled babe }
<D>__{stu bone gimme that goddam bat!}
<A>__{he wails on the pinata like ken griffey jr. o.d. stu tries to stop him, but it's too late the pinata bursts, and hundreds of purple assed monkeybone dolls spill out onto the ground! an equal number of rabid partygoers surge forward to scoop them up. the cops swing into action, trying to hold the crowd back...}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{he's getting away!}
<A>__{stu bone climbs a tree and jumps from a branch onto one of the twin jungle towers at the pavilion begins climbing toward the giant monkeybone balloon moored up above! o.d. stu sees him pulls away from julie }
<C>__{o.d. stu}
<D>__{i love you!}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{stu!!}
<A>__{stu bone unties the mooring rope and wraps it around his midsection. now freed, the balloon lifts into the air, carrying him aloft! o.d. stu climbs up the opposite tower as the balloon starts to drift away. he grabs hold of the mooring rope as it whips past. and the team of surgeons who have been combing the grounds in search of o.d. stu catch sight of him just as he floats off into the air, on the end of the rope!}
<C>__{head surgeon}
<D>__{look! it's him!}
