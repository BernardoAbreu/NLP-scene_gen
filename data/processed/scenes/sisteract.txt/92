<D>__{this sunday's hymn is inspired by the lesson of mary magdalene. you know the one. mary magdalene was a young lady with a past. she was no stranger to sin. she was no stranger to practically everybody. many condemned her. the whole neighborhood. but one man refused to do so. one man said, hey now, wait a minute. listen to the story.}
