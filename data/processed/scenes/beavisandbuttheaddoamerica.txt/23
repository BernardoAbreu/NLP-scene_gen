<L>__{exterior muddy's motel room day}
<A>__{harlan and ross, the two dumb looking rough necks that stole b&b's tv are standing outside muddy's motel room. harlan knocks on the door.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{where the hell is he?}
<C>__{harlan}
<D>__{you sure this is the right place?}
<A>__{harlan looks through the window and sees the shattered tv. no one's there. muddy's four by four squeals into the lot and skids to a stop next to harlan and ross' van. muddy gets out, looking really drunk now.}
<C>__{harlan }
<D>__{you muddy?}
<C>__{muddy}
<P>__{(slurring)}
<D>__{you the cops?}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{uh, no. earl sent us. you know, to take care of your wife...}
<A>__{muddy grabs ross by the collar.}
<C>__{muddy}
<D>__{what the hell?!... what about those other...}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{huh?}
<A>__{muddy tosses ross to the sidewalk and starts back to they four by four.}
<C>__{muddy}
<D>__{dammit!!! she did it to me again!!!}
<C>__{harlan}
<D>__{hey, i noticed your tv was broken. you wanna buy a new one?}
<A>__{muddy gets in the four by four and starts it.}
<C>__{muddy}
<D>__{i'm gonna go to vegas and kill all three a' them!}
<A>__{harlan and ross seem momentarily confused. muddy revs the engine, peels out backwards hitting the front of the van. this causes b&b's tv and some other loot to spill out the back onto the sidewalk. ross starts to pick it up.}
<C>__{harlan}
<D>__{just leave it. worthless piece o' crap.}
<C>__{ross}
