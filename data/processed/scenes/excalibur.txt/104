<L>__{interior cell evening}
<A>__{lancelot is staring into guenevere's eyes. she opens her shift, baring a breast with the innocence of a mother preparing to suckle a child. she presses her breast to his wound, her face to his chest, her arms enfolding him. she whispers.}
<C>__{guenevere}
<D>__{flesh on flesh. i will heal you.}
<A>__{his body trembles and his eyes brim with tears. he is lost.}
<L>__{interior hall of the round table, camelot night}
<A>__{the court is assembled, for the evening feast. there is music and heavy drinking. some knights are slouched across the table. lancelot, still weak, takes his seat, looking at the drunken and frivolous knights. arthur catches it, and they smile at each other.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{they miss the battlefield. i think we do too.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{but one can still keep a sword sharp riding out in the name of the king's law.}
<A>__{guenevere cannot tear her eyes from lancelot. he avoids her look. arthur looks from guenevere to lancelot, and speaks softly to him, across her, and with stabbing directness.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{it is not easy for the young ones to learn knightly virtues without the hard teaching of war and quest. it is only your example, lancelot, that binds them now.}
<A>__{then, addressing the hall:}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{which is the greatest quality of knighthood? courage? compassion? loyalty? humility? what do you say, merlin?}
<A>__{he is bent close to morgana, whispering. only when the hall rings with laughter does he look up.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{what?}
<P>__{(then seeing he has an audience)}
<D>__{the greatest? they blend together like the metals we mix to make a good sword.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i didn't ask for poetry. which is it?}
<A>__{merlin looks from arthur to guenevere to lancelot to arthur.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{all right. truth. it must be truth, above all. when a man lies he murders some part of the world.}
<A>__{an uneasy silence falls upon the feast. guenevere and lancelot cannot look at each other, and arthur feels it. lancelot jumps to his feet.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{conversation and court life don't suit me. i must take my rest in the forest.}
<A>__{guenevere stifles her dismay.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{hasn't merlin mended your wound?}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{it is deep...}
<A>__{arthur is about to rise to embrace him, but checks himself.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you will be sorely missed. heal yourself and come back.}
<A>__{the exchange has become closely intimate, even though they stand apart and speak before everyone in the large hall. lancelot leaves. only guenevere cannot watch.}
