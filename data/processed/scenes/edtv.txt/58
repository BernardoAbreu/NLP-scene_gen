<L>__{exterior street montage}
<A>__{ed is doing his morning errands. a little shopping a little banking always on camera. at one point, he walks into a glass door with the word "pull" on it. he pushed, banging his forehead. a child points to the word "pull." ed turns to the camera, embarrassed. later he buys a slice of pizza at a little place that's doing no business.}

<A>__{as he walks down the street, people call out "hey ed!" people in windows show him that they're watching him at that exact moment. the camera shoots some of the people in the windows. they see themselves on tv and they go wild. ed also is confronted by guys grabbing their crotches mockingly, calling out things like "hey, ed, holding your own?" or "hey, ed, howls the grand ballroom." ed is slightly chagrined by all this, but handles it with good grace. he seems to be loosening up.}
