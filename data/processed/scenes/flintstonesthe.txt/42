<A>__{montage assembly line day now, accompanied by heroic "industrial" type music, we see the fibrerock assembly line in full operation. this cannot be described now with appropriate justice, but it involves a series of animal powered conveyor belts, rube goldberg like funnels, spouts and chutes, and all sorts of gadgets, gizmos, bells and whistles, to wit: at one end of the building, dino powered dumpsters and lifters drop off all the ingredients; these get stomped chewed bashed and otherwise reduced to powder, which is then (courtesy of some squirting mastodans) mixed with water into a foam, which bubbles through a long sawmill type trough and is held back by a gate. meanwhile, we see a sample item (in this case, a stone sofa) as it is placed before two "goatasauruses" which butt heads and smash the sofa between the two halves of a clay mold. when the mold is opened and the sofa tossed aside, barney appears and personally "aims" the foam trough at a funnel in the top of the mold. pausing to "taste" the mix, he smiles, then shouts }

<D>__{ready... aim... fibre!}
<A>__{barney pulls a rope which opens the trough. "fibrefoam" pours into the mold.}

<A>__{presto! a fibrerock copy of the stone sofa drops neatly out of the mold, bounces lightly on the conveyor belt below! it sparkles with the tell tale celadon green shimmer of fibrerock. as it chugs along, the process repeats, and soon a score of identical sofas is in view.}
<B>__{end of assembly line}
<A>__{as a beaming fred watches, workers easily stack the fibrerock sofas (often one handed). nearby, we see fibrerock window frames, doors, chairs, etc. up angle slate's office balcony slate and lava watch the progress, dollar signs in their eyes.}
