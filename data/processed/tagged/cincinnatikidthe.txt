<A>__{series of establishing shots day exterior scenes of st. louis, particularly the riverside industrial district. even more important to establish than the place is the time: end of summer, 1936. election posters would help, with the republican ones stressing such themes as "burst the roosevelt bubble," "save the american way of life," "vote for landon and knox."}
<L>__{exterior factory day}
<A>__{one of the most typical scenes of the day: a mass picket line outside a textile or shoe factory. and the picketing is anything but peaceful; the demonstrators are in direct conflict with the police, who are trying to keep an entrance open for strike breakers. whatever the general action, a small segment of struggle breaks off from it, and it is this that our camera picks up: some police chasing some pickets or some pickets chasing some strike breakers, the one faction pursuing the other up an alley with violent intent.}
<L>__{exterior alley day}
<A>__{a couple of the pursuers catch up to the pursued and assault them with clubs or other weapons. the fighting is bitter, dirty and noisy.}
<L>__{interior kitchen in sleazy restaurant near railroad}
<A>__{the eight men gathered here in a game of five card stud are clearly removed from the struggle outside, even though the sounds of it are very close, coming through window opening on the alley. in fact the noise is so loud that the dealer of the hand in progress reacts in annoyance.}
<C>__{dealer}
<D>__{somebody shut the goddam window. let a man think.}
<A>__{the player nearest the window shuts it. the dealer, who also owns the restaurant, is the talkative type of poker player. except for the cincinnati kid, the other men at the table look like hoods of one sort or another: gunmen, labor spies, extortionists, what have you. the man who fancies himself the toughest of them all is named danny, and he and the kid have almost all the money on the table between them, about a hundred dollars in front of each. no other player has more than a few dollars left, and now, as fifth cards are dealt, there is about forty dollars in the pot. only four men are left in the hand.}
<C>__{dealer}
<D>__{possible straight gets a }
<P>__{(deals the card)}
<D>__{ lovely little four.}
<C>__{first player}
<D>__{on the last hand even, you couldn't give me a break.}

<D>__{i put the brakes on your straight, didn't i?}

<D>__{ninety four bucks.}
<C>__{dealer}
<D>__{biggest pot of the whole game, i got to drop.}

<P>__{(to first player)}
<D>__{interested?}
<C>__{first player}
<D>__{wouldn't call you if i had a pair higher'n sixes. which i ain't.}
<A>__{he turns over his cards, leaving it up to the kid.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{don't seem like he'd bet out without something better than the sixes, does it?}
<P>__{(fingers hole card as if to fold)}
<D>__{cost me every cent i've won since yesterday afternoon.}
<P>__{(studies danny's face)}
<D>__{but i tell you, i got this stubborn streak. call the ninety four dollars.}
<A>__{he counts out the money, which is almost all he has.}
<C>__{danny}

<D>__{you can't have better than a pair of kings!}

<D>__{oh, i'm not claiming anything that fine.}

<D>__{just enough to beat the pair of sixes.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{you seen my hole card, you bastard!}
<P>__{(indicating dealer)}
<D>__{he was dealing them high.}
<A>__{attending to first things first, the kid has been pulling in the pot, adding it to his own stake, and pocketing the total. now as danny accuses him again, the kid looks him squarely in the face.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{you stole that dough.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{you better watch those loose lips of yours, you want to have any teeth left behind them buster.}
<A>__{he stands up.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{you wouldn't of shelled out ninety four bucks }
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{i called you on account of i didn't think you had another pair or another six and i know a punk like you would get greedy and try and buy the last hand.}
<A>__{he walks off, disappearing through a door marked "men."}
<L>__{interior men's room the kid at mirror}
<A>__{he is waiting when the door opens abruptly, and danny appears, his right hand in his coat pocket. the kid's hand goes to his own pocket and as he whirls around, a straight razor appears in it, its blade snapped open. pushing danny to the wall with one hand, he keeps him pinned there with the razor in the other, while he bolts the door. danny gets his right hand out of the pocket with a gun in it, but the kid moves the razor blade against his neck.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{drop it.}
<A>__{as the gun clatters to the floor, and the others force the door, the kid takes a step backward to provide enough momentum, then swings at danny's middle with his left, dropping him, then jumps up on the wash basin and wriggles his way out through a window. superimpose: main titles danny recovers his balance and his gun, unbolts the door just before it is smashed in, and runs with the others to get out of the building and after the kid.}
<L>__{exterior alley back of restaurant day}
<A>__{the conflicting parties from the picket lines have moved on. the kid drops from the window to the ground and starts to run toward the railroad yards. a few moments later, danny and four other poker players appear and run after him.}
<L>__{exterior railroad yards day}
<A>__{the chase across the tracks goes on behind the credits. the kid's pursuers split into two groups to cut him off, and they seem to have succeeded in cornering him against a track on which a passenger train is bearing down, headed for the station. his dubious chance of escape depends on his getting beyond this track in front of the train, which, with a burst of speed, he manages to accomplish just in time. the passenger train divides the kid from his pursuers, and we pan with the train into the depot.}
<L>__{interior union station, st. louis}
<A>__{the train slowly stops. amid all the atmosphere of arrival in a day when the pullman car was still the ultimate in travel, lancey hodges appears on a platform, takes his bag from the pullman porter and passes it on to a red cap before he has descended the steps. he walks with other passengers and red caps toward the center of the station.}

<C>__{kid}
<D>__{you lost.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{i didn't lose. i'm too good to lose when i set my mind to it. i play poker a certain way, kid. i've had my lancey hodges. only with me it was whistling sam magee to new orleans.}
<C>__{kid}
<P>__{(respectfully)}
<D>__{i heard about him.}

<D>__{well then you know it all... about 20 years ago it was, maybe more.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{why, i lost it. it dried me up on the inside for a long, a very long time.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{i been where i'm going, know what i mean?}
<A>__{the kid nods as they come to where an old wooden pier extends into the river. along the river bank can be seen a small portion of the mile long hooverville that stretches up and down the mississippi.}
<L>__{exterior pier}
<A>__{they walk out on the pier and eventually stop, look out at the river, watching the working boats. they have their thoughts; the shooter smoking his cigar.}

<P>__{(after some time,}

<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{but you're not going to take my word for it, are you? are you now?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{no, i ain't. i can't.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{i know, i know. you got to find out for yourself.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{i don't figure to take him right away. but if i can hang in there long enough, i can outlast him. if i can outlast him, i got a chance. you admit that, don't you, that i got a chance?}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{i already said i didn't think you were ready.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{did you think you were ready when you sat down with whistling sam magee?}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{kid, i thought i was the best stud poker player in the world. i'm telling you now, i thought i was the best.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{well, i don't think i'm just a cocky square with a fair hand with cards. i got something.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{no, you ain't no cocky square. and you probably got something.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{okay. and i ain't saying that you was either when you sat down with whistling sam magee.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{if you got the stuff, being a little cocky don't hurt you none.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{well, would you say if i got any chance at all?}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{this much of a chance. if lancey is not right. if he's got a cold, or his stomach ulcer is acting up, or something like that.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{but then everybody'd see he wasn't right and it wouldn't prove nothing. listen, we got to have it understood. if he's not right, we call it off till he is.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{you're set on a real showdown, aren't you? your mind's all made up.}
<A>__{they start back off the pier.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{i got to. you said yourself i got to. i'm overdue.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{yeah, you been around a long time i was a lot younger than you when i went up against whistling sam but you'd be kinda young too, to be the man.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{i gotta find out.}
<C>__{shooter}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{want me to set it up?}
<C>__{kid}
<P>__{(gratefully)}
<D>__{i wish you would, shooter man.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{all right.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{hey, what if he turns me down?}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{he won't, the way i will spread the word. he'll have to take you on, someone in your class. if he ducked it, that'd make you the man.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{you think he knows i'm around?}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{he can smell meat like you a mile and a half up the river. he knows you're around and he'll sit down with you. you want to butt heads with the man, i will set it up.}
<A>__{ahead, on the levee, christian is seen waiting for the kid. she has not yet seen them as they approach off the pier.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{there's your woman.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{i wouldn't want to wait around too long. i want to get in and get it over with.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{he must of come to st. louis for a big money game. i will probably get asked do i want to deal it for them. and however long that takes, he'll have to rest up for you.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{oh, well, if he's tooling a dollar, i can understand that. sure.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{you got much of a stake?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{close to three grand.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{work on it. but three grand will give you a ride and even if you don't win, why you'll come away with a good idea of what you're made of. but once you go in kid you can't quit. you get that straight right now. two of you go in and only one of you can come out.}
<A>__{christian sees them and moves toward them.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{well, school's out. i damn sure don't want no lessons. i want everything he's got.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{it's the only way to be, kid.}
<A>__{shooter turns away abruptly as christian arrives, giving her a brief nod.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{see you.}
<A>__{the kid takes christian's arm automatically; he watches the shooter walk way down harold street. he and christian head in another direction. she is humming a mountain tune.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{when we leaving town, kid? this week?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{no, i won't be ready. not for a while.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{i thought }
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{might even turn out we don't go.}
<A>__{she is surprised by this and, in her own hesitant way, curious.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{you must feel different about it than you did saturday.}
<A>__{he looks at her fondly and, for one fleeting moment of weakness, is actually tempted to tell her about lancey. but it is too sharp a break with tradition.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{yeah, i'm feeling a little different.}
<P>__{(time lapse)}
<L>__{interior kid's bedroom}
<A>__{it is night and the room is lit only by a single lamp where christian sits in her nightgown on a chair by the window, turning over the pages of a mail order catalogue. in f.g. the kid lies on his back under a sheet on the bed, his eyes closed and his hands clasped tensely behind his neck. he opens his eyes and turns to look at her. the movement catches her eye, and she instantly stops turning the pages, afraid the noise has disturbed him.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{it's all right. you don't have to act like a cat. you're not bothering me.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{you want me to turn out the light?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{no. i'm overtired, that's why i can't sleep.}
<P>__{(sits up and swings his feet to the floor)}
<D>__{why can't you sleep?}
<C>__{christian}
<P>__{(lightly)}
<D>__{undertired, i guess. if a person rests all day, she doesn't have much to rest up from at night.}
<P>__{(stands up)}
<D>__{why don't you have a nice hot bath? i could give you a rubdown and then you could have a nice hot bath, and then maybe you could sleep.}
<A>__{she waits at the foot of the bed for him to come slowly to a decision.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{'kay. can't hurt to try it.}
<A>__{she goes into the bathroom, where she turns the water on gently so the tub will take a long while to fill. then she takes a bottle of alcohol from the medicine chest and returns to the bedroom with it. she stands in front of him waiting for him to move, but the kid is singularly listless. not till she sets the bottle down does he respond by turning his face to the pillow. she goes right to work on his shoulder muscles, and she seems to know what she is doing.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{what did you do with yourself this time?}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{last night i went to a movie with the shooter's woman. french movie.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{in french?}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{they had the words in english at the bottom of the picture. but the shooter's woman knew what they were saying without it. pig's woman or somebody told me she went to college.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{sure. majored in man eating.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{i think maybe she really did go. but i never quite dared to up and ask her.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{i didn't know you ran with the shooter's woman.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{we got to be kind of friendly when you both were in that three day game down to cairo. 'course she's older'n me.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{and been around more. a lot more. what was the movie like?}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{weird. it wasn't a straight story where you knew whose side you were on, the way you do in regular pictures.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{american pictures.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{yeah. there were lots of things i didn't understand.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{what was it about?}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{well, there's this town in europe a long time ago where they get a message from a spanish general he's coming to spend the night with his troops. so all the men are scared silly about what the soldiers will do to them.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{nothing weird about that.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{but all the wives and daughters tell the men to go hide somewhere and let them bargain with the enemy.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{that don't make much sense.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{wait. the way they handle it is they go to bed with the spaniards. and the next morning the soldiers go off peacefully and everybody's happy.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{including the husbands and fathers? don't they suspect?}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{that's part of what i wasn't sure of. i guess they know what went on but they care more about their safety and their money than they do about their honor.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{then they got their heads screwed on straight. honor's just an idea. you can't see or feel it and you can't eat it and you sure as hell can't get any mileage on it.}
<A>__{she slaps him on the rump and straightens up.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{i will just turn off the bath water.}
<A>__{he doesn't move but just stays relaxed and closes his eyes.}

<A>__{christian, humming softly, turns off the water, takes a large towel from a rack and puts it on a stool by the tub where it will be more convenient for him. she lingers to test the water with her finger and do anything else she can think of to assure maximum comfort for her man. then she steps back into the bedroom. the sight of him makes her advance cautiously and confirm her suspicion that he is asleep.}

<D>__{hello... yes, it is. you want him?}
<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{shooter! telephone! shooter!}
<A>__{she gets no answer, which is no wonder in view of the noise from the radio. but the radio is across the room and it's slightly easier for her to get out of the side of the bed she's on, and go to the door of the shooter's room. she opens this and we see the shooter in bed in his own small quarters, reading a magazine. he turns around inquiringly.}

<C>__{craigie}
<D>__{let me get this straight in my head. cards is all a matter of luck, who gets dealt the best ones.}
<A>__{the kid stands up and selects six playing cards from a deck in his pocket. during the next few lines he uses the paste on the shelf to stick together three pairs of them so as to form three double thick cards. one of these has two faces, another two backs, and the third a back and a face.}
<C>__{craigie}
<D>__{so when one of you professional gamblers sits down with a bunch of your what do you call them customers, clients?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{the technical term is "suckers." or "marks."}
<C>__{craigie}
<D>__{their chance of winning is just as good as yours, except if you got a way to control it, who gets what cards. right?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{not right. that's cheating and it's not any part of what we're talking about.}
<C>__{craigie}
<D>__{then how do you win?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{i will show you.}
<A>__{he displays his three cards.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{you see one of these cards is white on both sides, one is red on both sides, and the other is white on one side, red on the other.}
<C>__{craigie}
<D>__{what about it?}
<A>__{the kid lifts a straw hat off a peg on the porch wall.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{this. i put the three cards in a hat and shake them up, and then i ask you to draw one card out blind. put it face down on the table so neither of us can see the bottom side.}
<A>__{craigie does as instructed. the ensuing dialogue assumes the card he picks is red on top; if it's white the words "red" and "white" will be reversed in the dialogue.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{okay, red on top. that eliminates the all white card, right. so the card you've picked is one of two the all red or the red and white. one out of two is an even chance, an even money proposition. right you follow me?}
<C>__{craigie}
<D>__{i think so.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{so if i said i will bet you a dollar to seventy five cents the other side of that card is red, you'd take the bet wouldn't you?}
<C>__{craigie}
<D>__{seems like. yeah.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{and that answer makes you a sucker. because the odds are two to one, the other side of that card is red, and i ought to be offering you a dollar to fifty cents instead of seventy five.}
<C>__{craigie}
<D>__{but if there are just the two possibilities.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{there are three possibilities.}
<P>__{(indicating card on table)}
<D>__{that can be the red side of the red and white card, or it can be either side of the all red card. in two cases out of three the other side is red. and i'd win the bet from you two out of every three times we made it.}
<C>__{craigie}
<P>__{(dubiously)}
<D>__{you would?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{sure. it's obvious when i explain it, isn't it?}
<C>__{craigie}
<D>__{reckon so. except if there's only two things that the bottom side can be, red or white }
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{take my word for it the odds are two to one. and knowing that is the difference between your gambling man and your sucker. not who gets the better cards but who knows what the proper odds are. in a poker game there can be a million different situations, each with a different set of odds to figure. the man who ends up winners is the man who knows when to bet and how much...}
<C>__{craigie}
<D>__{the sucker is still took advantage of, isn't he? the gambler knows something he don't know.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{sure like if you grow better corn or raise a cow that gives more milk than the other guy's. or two business men are in competition, or two lawyers are up against each other in a courtroom. whatever your line is, the one who wins out is the one who knows his job better.}
<C>__{craigie}
<D>__{seems like there should be something else to it }
