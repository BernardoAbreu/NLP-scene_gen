<A>__{the girl reaches out, steadies his trembling hand... and pulls the red hot coil to the cigarette between her lips. when... in a thunderous crash!! the glistening wet rock comes smashing through their windshield!!!!}
<L>__{exterior freeway night}
<A>__{the chevy brakes... skids across the rain slicked pavement and turns a somersault, landing upside down on its hood. another angle: closer the camera drifts across the fractured front end of the overturned chevy. the twisted hunk of metal hisses... steams... groans. the front tire spins lazily to a halt on its mangled axle. in the background high overhead we see a man standing on a highway overpass. he's leaning on the railing and calmly looking down at the wrecked car.}

<A>__{early grayce, 25, athletic build, big watery eyes, jet black hair, stands by the railing. rain streaks down his expressionless face. he dropped the rock. early's pov the 70's chevy lying in the deserted highway. the driver crawls out covered with blood. still clutched in his hand is the car cigarette lighter. its red hot coil extinguishing quickly to a faint glow. angle: closer on early calmly looking down with no pity. even closer... water running down his face. closer yet... on his eye... and right into the dilated pupil. as we enter it it's like being in a dark winding tunnel filled with the hum of dynamos and the loud rhythmic pumping of powerful machinery.}
