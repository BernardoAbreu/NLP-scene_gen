<A>__{with the star man's serenade wafting over the nebraska plains, we fall back to find a highway patrol car tagging along at a safe distance behind the mustang.}
<L>__{exterior best western motel night}
<A>__{the star man stops the mustang in front of the office. he and jenny get out and go inside. as the door closes on them, three nebraska highway patrol cars speed up the off ramp. the lead car turns right on a surface street and enters the motel parking lot at the far end. the middle car goes straight across the intersection and positions itself at the curb next to the driveway, giving access to a frontage road which leads to an on ramp. the last car also turns right on the surface street, but parks in a restaurant parking lot directly across from the office.}
