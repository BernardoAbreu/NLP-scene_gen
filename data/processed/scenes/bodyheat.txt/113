<A>__{matty comes out. she's wearing a light, simple shift. she walks over to a small table and begins putting some dirty dishes and glasses on a small tray. suddenly, racine takes her into his arms from behind. she gasps in terror; he turns her to him. he is wearing only cut off blue jean shorts and his body is wet, glistening. his hair is soaking, slicked straight back. he looks different. she sees who it is and kisses him deeply. they whisper }
