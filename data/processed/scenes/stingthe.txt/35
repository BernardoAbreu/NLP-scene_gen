<A>__{we open on hooker sleeping in some remote corner of the station, covered with newspapers for warmth, and barely distinguishable from the clutter of junk surrounding him. a station security officer, on his morning sweep, wanders by and delivers a terrific blow to the soles of hooker's feet with a nightstick. hooker jolts awake with a cry of pain, as the officer diffidently moves on toward another sleeping victim. tired and sore from his night in the station, hooker struggles to his feet and attempts to take stock of the situation. he tries to smooth the wrinkles out of his suit, but it's futile. a quick check of his wallet finds it as empty as he'd remembered it.}
