<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{travelers' camp night the urlanders are gathered around a fire, sharing a meager supper. the man named greil pokes at the stew pot.}
<C>__{greil}
<D>__{i left my farm with seeds unplanted, calves unborn, nothing but a wife to chase down the strays, and for what? a funeral, that's what.}
<A>__{he walks up and down behind valerian.}
<C>__{greil}
<D>__{because some people said, find a magician. not just a local fellow, an import, a good forty leagues from home. an all powerful necromancer. ha some necromancer!}
<A>__{malkin, an older man, speaks up.}
<C>__{malkin}
<D>__{hold your tongue, greil. sit. eat.}
<C>__{greil}
<D>__{i will not sit. i will not eat. see you the great bear. his tail points east. it's the equinox. have you forgotten? or rather not think about it?}
<C>__{valerian}
<P>__{(miserable)}
<D>__{he's right. i brought us here for nothing. may the gods help whoever's daughter it is tonight.}
<A>__{there is a noise from the darkness beyond the campfire. two of the men get to their feet and listen. at first silence, then more rustling. without a word the two men dart into the bushes and haul two interlopers before the company: galen and hodge.}
<C>__{hodge}
<D>__{good morrow, good morrow. peace be with you.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{easy now. we mean no harm. we've been looking for you.}
<C>__{greil}
<P>__{(growl)}
<D>__{well, you've found us.}
<C>__{galen}
<P>__{(brushing himself off)}
<D>__{more the other way around, i'd say.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{a few words, that's all. you were looking for a conjurer.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{he's dead.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{right. requiscat in pace.}
<P>__{(he takes a deep breath)}
<D>__{ecce: magister novus!}
<C>__{greil}
<D>__{how say you?}
<A>__{galen surveys the puzzled faces. he draws himself up and plunges in:}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{my lord ulrich is no longer. all that you asked of him, you may now expect of me. the dangers he would face, i will now conquer. the task he would undertake i will now fulfill. i am galen bradwardyn, inheritor of ulrich's craft and knowledge, and i am the sorcerer you seek.}
<A>__{there is a moment of depressed silence. hodge rolls his eyes. greil starts to chuckle, then to laugh. soon the others are laughing too.}
<C>__{greil}
<D>__{well, that's a handsome thought, o wizard of wizards. but if there's one thing our friend tyrian has shown us, it's to beware the pig in the poke. who's got a dagger?}
<C>__{hodge}
<D>__{no tests!!}
<C>__{greil}
<D>__{call it proof, then.}
<A>__{someone brings out a dagger and hands it to greil. valerian pushes it away.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{we've seen enough tests.}
<A>__{but greil persists, waving the knife at the group.}
<C>__{greil}
<D>__{well i haven't. all i've seen is death. death in our families, death on the road, and tonight, death at home.}
<A>__{he lashes out with the knife. galen jumps back, but valerian steps in, delivering a quick kick to greil's gut, followed by a right to the jaw that sends the bigger man sprawling. he takes the knife.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{what's come over you, anyway? have you lost your wits?}
<A>__{he propels galen out of harm's way and sits him down on the other side of the fire. greil nurses his jaw.}
<C>__{greil}
<D>__{i don't like it. young snot nose comes in here for sport at our expense. we're on a fool's errand, but we don't have to listen to this. i don't want to hear any more about sorcery. i don't want to hear any more about spells.}
<A>__{valerian hands galen a plate of food.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{you must be hungry.}
<C>__{galen}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{what's the matter with him?}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{it's not just him. it's all of us. it's the equinox.}
<A>__{they both look up at the moon.}
