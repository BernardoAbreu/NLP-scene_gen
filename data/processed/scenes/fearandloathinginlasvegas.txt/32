<A>__{duke and gonzo walk through the lobby. black, mirrored, sleek, classy.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{holy shit! they almost had us there! that was quick thinking.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{what do you expect? i'm your attorney. you owe me five bucks. i want it now.}
<A>__{duke shrugs and hands over the $5.}

<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{after a lot of bad noise, he let us in for nothing provided we would stand quietly at the back and not smoke.}
<A>__{as duke and gonzo disappear through the door we can hear the orchestra blasting out a highly blandized "sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band." a beat. the door flies open and bouncers manhandle duke and gonzo out. despite the rough treatment they're both screeching}

<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{jesus creeping shit!}
