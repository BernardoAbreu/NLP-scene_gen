<L>__{exterior scenic picnic area day}
<A>__{the patrol car comes skidding around the corner. duke stands beside the red shark, completely relaxed and smiling. the highway patrolman gets out of the car, screaming.}
<C>__{highway patrolman}
<D>__{just what the fuck did you think you were doing?!}
<A>__{duke smiles.}
<C>__{highway patrolman}
<D>__{may i see your license.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{of course, officer.}
<A>__{duke reaches for it. and both men look down at a beer can which duke had, somehow, forgotten was in his hand.}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{i knew i was fucked.}
<A>__{the cop relaxes actually smiles... he reaches out for duke's wallet, then holds out his other hand for the beer.}
<C>__{highway patrolman}
<D>__{could i have that, please?}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{why not? it was getting warm anyway.}
<A>__{the highway patrolman takes it, pours out the beer glances in the back seat of the red shark. amongst the bars of soap... a case of warm beer. duke smiles back at him.}
<C>__{highway patrolman}
<D>__{you realize...}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{yeah. i know. i'm guilty. i understand that. i knew it was a crime but i did it anyway. shit, why argue? i'm a fucking criminal.}
<C>__{highway patrolman}
<D>__{that's a strange attitude.}
<A>__{he looks at duke thoughtfully.}
<C>__{highway patrolman}
<D>__{you know i get the feeling you could use a nap. there's a rest area up ahead. why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{a nap won't help. i've been awake for too long three or four nights. i can't even remember. if i go to sleep now, i'm dead for twenty hours.}
<A>__{the highway patrolman smiles.}
<C>__{highway patrolman}
<D>__{okay. here's how it is. what goes into my book, as of noon, is that i apprehended you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination, right? where you plan to take a long nap. do i make myself clear?}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{how far is baker? i was hoping to stop there for lunch.}
<C>__{highway patrolman}
<D>__{not my jurisdiction. the city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. can you make it that far?}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{i will try. i've been wanting to go to baker for a long time. i've heard a lot about it.}
<A>__{the patrolman holds the door for duke who gets in.}
<C>__{highway patrolman}
<D>__{excellent seafood. with a mind like yours, you'll probably want to try the land crab. try the majestic diner.}
<A>__{the patrolman slams the door shut.}
