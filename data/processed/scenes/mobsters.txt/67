<C>__{tommy reina}
<D>__{in the corner. he's been askin' after ya.}
<B>__{at the corner table}
<A>__{joe masseria holds court. fat, crude, a man of unrestrained power and appetite, he has, none the less, a charmingly earthy directness of manner. at masseria's right hand his toady, sonny catania, dances attendance. across the table, vito noto, still in his teens, enjoys the favor of two ladies. masseria pounds his empty wine goblet on the table and howls.}
<C>__{masseria}
<D>__{where's my fuckin' wine! spend five grand for a party an' can't get a fuckin' glass of wine.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{ya already look drunk ta me, don.}

<A>__{masseria laughs. rising, he envelops charlie in a bear hug.}
<C>__{masseria}
<D>__{buona fuckin' sera.}
<A>__{he busses charlie on the cheek and whispers.}
<C>__{masseria}
<D>__{maranzano's tryin' ta kill me.}
<A>__{in the men's room a couple of guys pull up their flies as catania herds them out of the men's room. masseria pushes his way in, followed by luciano. masseria moves to one of the stalls and drops his pants without bothering to close the door.}
<C>__{masseria}
<D>__{he's nottin' but a fuckin' cunt. he's got no balls so he schemes and lies like an old woman.}
<A>__{not especially anxious to watch masseria take a dump, charlie steps over to the urinals.}
<C>__{masseria}
<D>__{he wants you on ice, 'cause that way he thinks he can beat me! fuck that! come with me and we'll knock the crap out of him together!}
<A>__{masseria punctuates his tirade with a blast of intestinal gas.}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{if ever i need a boss, joe.}
<C>__{masseria}
<D>__{yeah. yeah. i bet ya feed maranzano that same line.}
<A>__{in the ensuing silence, the only sound in charlie's piss ringing against the porcelain of the urinal.}
<C>__{masseria}
<D>__{i like that.}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{whatta ya mean, boss?}
