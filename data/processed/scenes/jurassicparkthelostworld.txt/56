<L>__{exterior edge of hunters' camp night}
<A>__{at the edge of the hunters' camp, nick, sarah, and malcolm scramble down a hillside and stop at the edge of the laser barriers. there are three beams, each about two feet apart, the tallest almost six feet off the ground. nick reaches the edge and crouches. sarah, helped by malcolm, steps up onto his back and jumps over the top, landing with a crunch. nick is next, given a boost by malcolm, who is then left alone on the other side. he backs up a few steps, jogs right at the lasers, then springs off his good leg and does the fosburry flop right over the top. he lands with a thud, to the silent admiration of the other two. further in the camp, the three of them creep along, hiding behind a stack of fuel barrels. they lean around the edge for a look. they're directly behind the row of vehicle. they move, into the open, covering the ground between them and the jeeps. reaching them, nick hits the dirt and wriggles under the first one. malcolm and sarah stand lookout. under the jeep, nick pulls the bolt cutter from his back pocket. he squirms along until he finds the jeep's fuel line and he snips it. he ducks out of the way just as the stream of fuel begins to pour into the dirt.}
<B>__{malcolm and sarah}
<A>__{move slowly down the line, standing watch as nick crawls out from under the first jeep and proceeds to the second. they hear another snip, then keep moving, to cover him as he moves to the third. from in the distance, malcolm hears a sound, a faint, high pitched screeching. he turns and looks to that direction.}
