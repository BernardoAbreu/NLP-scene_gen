<L>__{exterior majestic forest sunset}
<A>__{fading sunlight bleeds through awesomely beautiful trees as willow and the brownies trek into the magical fairy kingdom. elora danan falls into a peaceful sleep.}
<L>__{exterior fairy kingdom night}
<A>__{willow comes to a halt. his mouth drops open. the forest is a luminous milky way of dancing, flying fairies, like fireflies. the brownies tug at his pant legs and whisper.}
<C>__{teemo}
<D>__{come on. this is a privilege. no body ever gets called before her majesty.}
<A>__{wonder struck, willow walks into a clearing where colorful night flowers bloom. he lowers himself onto an enormous toadstool, testing it with his hand. other brownies stand watching, like courtiers. the tiny fairies fly up to willow's face and giggle: they look like five year old girls, full of mischief and fun. suddenly a strange light begins to throb behind the trees, peircing the forest with helter skelter beams. willow throws up his arms as the bright light stings his eyes.}
<C>__{rool}
<D>__{stand up! it's the queen!}
<A>__{cherlindrea, the fairy queen, materializes out of frag ments of moving light, diaphanous, sylph like, beauti ful.}
<C>__{cherlindrea}
<D>__{willow ufgood.}
<C>__{willow}
<P>__{(blinded)}
<D>__{yes...?}
<C>__{cherlindrea}
<D>__{i hope you are comfortable here, inside my kingdom...}
<A>__{willow says nothing, still batling the bright light.}
<C>__{teemo}
<D>__{talk! say something!}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{i can't see anything she's too bright!}
<C>__{cherlindrea}
<D>__{i'm sorry...}
<A>__{the light diminishes, enabling willow to see the queen. she is a beautiful vision, with flowing hair and lumi nous eyes. her magical presence both stuns and impresses willow. she turns to the brownies.}
<C>__{cherlindrea}
<D>__{broke heart of nightingale for our honored guest.}
<A>__{all the courtier brownies snap to attention and go into action, bustling about, going to work, some even trip ping over one another. they bring willow a drink in a delicate cup shaped leaf, and he takes a sip. the queen dissolves and reappears near willow. she le ans down and opens the baby's swaddling and looks at the mark on the baby's arm.}
<C>__{cherlindrea}
<D>__{it is elora danan! the prophecy has come true.}
<A>__{the tiny fairies and the brownies stop work and sigh with respect and amazement. cherlindrea seems to levi tate the baby out of willow's arms, floating her magi cally onto a special cradle of stram and sticks. the brownies and fairies crowd around, with great rever ence.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{you mean, you know who this baby belongs to?}
<C>__{cherlindrea}
<D>__{she belongs to all of us. she is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.}
<A>__{willow starts to get up.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{what a relief. now i can go home.}
<A>__{the queen fragments and reappears right in front of willow.}
<C>__{cherlindrea}
<D>__{no, willow. your journey has just begun. it has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of queen bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world. upon you depends this princess's life.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{me?}
<A>__{the fairy queen flashes and vanishes. willow lowers himself back down again. she reappears behind him.}
<C>__{cherlindrea}
<D>__{you are the guardian, willow. you must take her to tir asleen.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{what is tir asleen?}
<A>__{willow can't keep track of her. she keeps changing her shape. the brownies and fairies snicker at willow's confusion.}
<C>__{cherlindrea}
<D>__{it is a distant castle, where a great king and queen will look after elora danan and keep her safe until she is old enough to rule.}
<A>__{she is gone again. willow looks everywhere, frusturated by these riddles and mysteries.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{where is tir asleen? how far is it?}
<A>__{she reappears again.}
<C>__{cherlindrea}
<D>__{the way has been lost in time. but there is one person, a druid sor ceress, who might guide you there. she was exiled by queen bavmorda many years ago. her name is fin raziel.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{you need a warrior for this job. i'm nobody.}
<C>__{cherlindrea}
<D>__{you are very important, willow.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{no i'm not. have you really looked at me?}
<P>__{(jumps to his feet)}
<D>__{i'm short! even for a nelwyn!}
<A>__{from down at his feet, rool and teemo stare up, insult ed.}
<C>__{willow}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{why can't you do it? you have mag ical powers.}
<C>__{cherlindrea}
<D>__{my prsence cannot extend beyond this forest. but i can give you these...}
<A>__{cherlindrea drops three small objects in willow's hand.}
<C>__{cherlindrea}
<D>__{they will protect you. use them wisely.}
<A>__{willow looks at them for quite a while.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{they look like acorns.}
<C>__{cherlindrea}
<D>__{anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.}
<A>__{willow looks closely at the acorns, then up at the queen.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{they're magic? are you serious?}
<A>__{the forest light grows brighter. the queen looms over willow and he again has to shield himself from the brightness.}
<C>__{cherlindrea}
<P>__{(sternly)}
<D>__{i am very serious, willow. there is no time to lose.}
<A>__{now she intensifies her light so that willow backs away, completely covering his face.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{but i've got a family to think about! they need me!}
<A>__{the queen swirls around him like a solar wind, blowing the forest trees, scaring even the brownies. and then all of a sudden: silence. and total darkness. all we see, in dim moonlight, is willow's face, peeking out from between his fingers.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{hello...?}
<A>__{the queen's voice echoes the forest.}
<C>__{cherlindrea}
<D>__{bavmord'a powers are growing like an evil plague. soon she will con trol the lives of you children, your wife, your village...everyone.}
<A>__{very gradually and beautifully the firey fairies begin to flicker, restoring light to the forest. more light genlty brightens, bathing the woods, and the fairy queen reappears. she is holding elora danan in her arms. the brownies creep out from behind the trees. all eyes are upon willow.}
<C>__{cherlindrea}
<D>__{the choice is yours.}
<A>__{willow takes the baby and looks at her for a moment. he struggles with his conscience. the fairies and brownies wait in anticipation. at last willow looks up at them, resolved and determined.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{i will do it. yes, i will, i will do it!}
<A>__{the fairy kingdom sends up a great cheer and applause. fairies giggle playfully around willow's face, and brownies hug his ankles.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{but i only have one shoe.}
