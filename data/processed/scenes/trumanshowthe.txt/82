<L>__{interior sylvia's beach house. dusk.}
<A>__{the comfortably furnished room of a writer. walls lined with books. desk overlooking the sea, strewn with notes, photos and other reference material. sylvia's name on the spine of several published volumes. pages of unfinished manuscript, handwritten in blue ink. sylvia stands at a bookcase, looking for inspiration. as she pulls out a book, a magazine falls to the floor. truman's missing copy of time magazine. his face on the cover with the headline, "truman burbank and the lost generation". sylvia retrieves the magazine. in front of a nearby mirror, she holds truman's photographed face next to her own, for a moment imagining them together. then, catching herself, she quickly lowers the magazine, left alone with her own reflection.}
