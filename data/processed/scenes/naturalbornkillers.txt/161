<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{what would i do? me and my network would sue the entire los angeles county sheriffs department for flagrantly disregarding my safety. i'd go straight to my buddy, the mayor, and make sure everyone of those son of a bitches down there ends up on the unemployment line. in fact, i'd sue every man down there personally. i would make it my life's ambition to bring the la county jail to its knees. i would do expose after expose on the brutality, and the conditions, and the inhumanity that exists here.}
