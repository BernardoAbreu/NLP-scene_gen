<L>__{interior oak room, plaza hotel, new york night}
<A>__{long angle. sophisticated watering hole. crowded tonight. pan to find george alone, waiting. a waiter leads amelia to the table. george stands, smiling. but the smile is not returned. we close as they sit...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what’s wrong?}
<C>__{amelia }
<D>__{what could be wrong? i had such a lovely afternoon with elinor smith.}
<A>__{oh.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{she told you that i shut her out of the derby. and that’s true.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{and when were you going to tell me?}
<P>__{george (calm, straight)}
<D>__{never. i knew you’d go crazy. and i felt it needed to be done.}
<A>__{she can scarcely believe this.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{what? you think i wanted it done, but just let you do the dirty work?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i didn’t say that.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{because i’m no angel. business is competition and competition is rough, and i thank my stars that you’re there making this life happen for me, but...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you’re making your life hap...}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{but this is different.}
<A>__{it is.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{if women are going to stab women in the back, then women are going nowhere.}
<A>__{are you listening?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{from here on, i’ll just stab men in the back.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{you didn’t do this for business, anyway.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i did it for fun?}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{you did it because you love me.}
<A>__{that stops him.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{and when we’re married, you mustn’t ever...}
<A>__{now she stops. because his eyes are wide.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{what’s the big shock? i thought you wanted to get married.}
<A>__{full beat.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i did. i do.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{well, then.}
<A>__{his eyes moving over her face.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what about what you said? the day will come when you run away.}
<A>__{she nods. it will.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{you’ll be destroyed. and part of me will, too. and i think we both know it.}
<A>__{and yet.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{sometimes things happen that way. you’re not better safe than sorry.}
<A>__{tears stand in his eyes. he is so happy.}
<D>__{amelia (a whisper) (cont’d) yes?}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{hell yes.}
