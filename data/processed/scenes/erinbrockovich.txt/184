<A>__{it's dark. ed's seated at a table, alone. erin walks by the door, then spots him and stops in the doorway.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{believe it or not, i would've been satisfied with just the check.}
<A>__{ed turns, sees her.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{well, you go threatening to leave, i can't take any chances. you're the only person around who understands what i'm doing. things come up, i gotta know i got someone to turn to.}
<A>__{she sits, reading him.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{what kind of things come up?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{things like the head counsel for pg&e calling me with an offer.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{20 million, plus attorney's fees. take it or leave it.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{whoa. no shit.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{it's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{so what are you thinking?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{i'm thinking ... i wish someone else had to make this decision.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{50 thousand bucks is more than any other california toxic plaintiff has gotten. ever. but ...}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{... but it won't cover annabelle daniels's medical bills.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{and it's less than pocket change for pg&e.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{do you think we'd do better by going to trial?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{maybe. but maybe not. we still don't have anything linking this to pg&e corporate. plus, there's the statute problem. plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...}

<C>__{erin}
<D>__{that's a fucking fortune, ed. and you know i'm the last person on earth to walk away from a big payday. but you and me didn't get into this to get rich. we did it cause we both have this voice in our heads saying, do the right thing; get these plaintiffs what they deserve the right to live and die in some kind of comfort and peace. if 50,000 isn't gonna buy that, then we gotta say no.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{trust me. if you don't do the right thing for these people, getting that 6 million dollars is gonna feel like shit.}
