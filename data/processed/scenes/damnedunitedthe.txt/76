<L>__{interior dressing room baseball ground day (1972)}
<A>__{caption: "half time: derby 0, leeds 1" the derby players sit in the dressing room. shaking. terrified. trying to hide, find shelter, find protection. already fearing the rocket they will get, the lash of his tongue.. presently, the door opens, and clough walks in, carrying a bottle of brandy, remy martin.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{congratulations, lads! beautiful! that was as perfect a half of terrible football as i've ever seen. the plan you've obviously been hatching to get me the sack has worked a treat, so you deserve a little celebration...}
<A>__{clough pours brandy into a tea cup, gives it to a player..}
<C>__{clough }
<D>__{you do want me to get the sack?}
<C>__{mcgovern}
<D>__{no, boss.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{then why the fuck did you give it to their most dangerous player, johnny fucking giles?}
<C>__{mcgovern}
<D>__{i didn't see him.}
<A>__{clough turns to another player, (john o'hare), pours him a shot of cognac...}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{you want me to get the sack, mr o'hare?}
<C>__{o'hare}
<D>__{no, boss.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{that open goal? looked like a deliberate fucking miss to me. a miss to get your manager the sack.}
<A>__{clough turns to a third player, (colin todd), hands him a cup..}
<C>__{clough }
<D>__{you do want me to get the sack, mr. todd?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{no what?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{no, boss.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{the amount of bloody money i paid for you, i must have been out of my mind. you can't even keep on your feet.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{no, boss.}
<A>__{clough turns, and faces the room.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{you've all done a terrific job of getting me the sack. so i'm not letting you out of here for the second half, until you've finished the bottle.}
<A>__{the players stare at one another, holding their drinks.}
<C>__{clough }
<D>__{drink!!!}
<A>__{the players nervously down their drinks. clough exits..}
