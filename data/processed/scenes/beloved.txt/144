<L>__{exterior sawyer restaurant late afternoon.}
<A>__{paul waits outside in the cold, cupping his hands and breathing inside to keep them warm. he is rehearsing:}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{look here sethe..you ain't gonna like what i got to say but i got to say it...see, it's not the..a man can't...what i mean is, it ain't really me..see, it ain't weakness, the kind of weakness i can fight, that girl is doing it. i know you think i never liked her nohow, still don't, but she is doing it to me anyway. fixing me, sethe, she's fixed me and i can't break it...}
<A>__{sethe appears, exiting the back door of the restaurant with a scrap pan in the crook of her arm. to her surprise. she finds paul waiting for her.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{man, you make me feel like a young girl, you coming by to pick me up after work. nobody ever did that before. better watch out, i might start looking forward to it.}
<A>__{she tosses the bones and skins from the scrap pan into a heap before four dogs who wait there as if by appointment.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{got to rinse this out.}
<A>__{she enters the restaurant. paul watches the dogs eat watching them getting what they wanted. sethe re appears with a cloth over her head.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{you get off early or what?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i took off early.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{anything the matter?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{in a way of speaking.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{not cut back?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no, no. they got plenty of work with them pigs..more they can handle. i just..}
<P>__{(sethe waits)}
<D>__{you ain't gonna like what i'm about to say, sethe.}
<A>__{sethe steps forward to hear what paul came to tell her. there is no apprehension or anger in her look. instead, a calm resolve as if she were already able to accept whatever he had to tell her without it being anyone's fault. as if she already knew he cane to say he was leaving her. she smiles.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{well say it, paul d...whether i like it or not.}
<A>__{paul knows what she's expecting. and when he sees her diminished expectation, the melancholy without blame in her eyes....he can't tell her about beloved. he is filled with respect and admiration for her in that moment. something pops into his head and out of his mouth that wasn't planned;}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i want you pregnant, sethe. would you do that for me?}
<A>__{sethe breaks up with laughter. paul joins in.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{you came by here to ask me that!? you are one crazy headed man. you right; i don't like it!...don't you think i'm a little too old to start that all over again?}
<A>__{she slips her fingers into his.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{think about it.}
<A>__{paul lifts them, putting the tips of her fingers on his cheek. he smiles broadly; she laughs, shaking her head. a burden transformed into a gift, so suddenly. they begin walking. sethe and paul catch and snatch each other's fingers, stealing quick pats on the behind, joyfully. paul throws his arm around sethe and squeezes. she lets her head touch his chest. they stop and stay that way for a moment not breathing. sethe closes her eyes. paul looks up to the trees lining the roadside like defending arms against attack. softly, suddenly, it begins to snow. sethe opens her eyes:}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{mercy.}
