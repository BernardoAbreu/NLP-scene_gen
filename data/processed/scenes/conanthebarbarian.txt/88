<L>__{interior colossus head night}
<A>__{the great haunches of the beast roast over the fire. conan turns the meat. behind him, tamara approaches. she has cleaned herself up, her white robe translucent in light of the fire, her wet hair glistening. conan can't help but notice her supple skin, her curves. he stops chewing. tamara notices. embarrassed, she turns so that he can only see her side. conan returns to his food.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{what were the women of your tribe like, conan?}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{they fought beside the men.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{so they were equals. and your mother?}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{she died in battle, even as i was born.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{so you never knew her. it was the same with me. i've always known being a mother was somehow not my fate. but }
<A>__{tamara falters, unsure. but conan's quiet eases her.}
<C>__{tamara }
<D>__{you said earlier khor kalba will bring only death. were you trying to scare me, or do you really believe our end lies there?}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{i don't lie.}
<A>__{tamara nods, having heard as much about conan. she turns back to face him, no longer hiding her body.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{then we don't have much time. your mother perished too young, but at least she died having known the touch of one who cared.}
<A>__{tamara steps closer to conan.}
<C>__{tamara }
<D>__{so do you care, conan?}
<A>__{conan rises to her, his broad form looming over her slight build. but conan shows surprising gentleness as he removes her robe and pulls her naked body into his, their mouths meeting in a desperate kiss.}
<B>__{love scene}
<A>__{conan lies atop tamara by the fire, their sinewy limbs intertwined, fingers locked together. he thrusts into her, causing her face to contort in pleasure and pain. the fire grows brighter as tamara rolls on top, undulating as their pace quickens. tamara cries out in ecstasy.}
<B>__{aftermath}
<A>__{tamara stares into the fire, her body wrapped around conan's. she gently caresses the notched scars cut into his arm.}
<C>__{tamara }
<D>__{i've only ever heard you speak of what you'd die for, conan. what would you live for?}
<A>__{conan, his eyes closed, keeps them shut.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{do you ever tire of talking? let me rest, woman.}
<A>__{tamara reaches down between conan's legs. his eyes open.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{i thought that may work.}
<A>__{conan growls and pulls himself atop tamara. looking down at her face, her hair loose and wild, she's beautiful in the soft glow of the firelight.}
<C>__{tamara }
<D>__{i see you clearly now, finally, after all this time.}
<P>__{(she kisses him deeply)}
<D>__{i would be that which you live for, conan, if you would have me. you may have faith in nothing, conan but i have faith in you.}
<A>__{conan lowers himself back down upon her.}
