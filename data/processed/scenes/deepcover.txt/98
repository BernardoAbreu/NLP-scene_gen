<L>__{exterior a cemetery morning}
<A>__{ramon gallegos lays a bouquet of white lillies on a grave. he kneels, whispers a prayer, crosses himself. he rises and walks to where molto and the other guards hold hull and elias. gallegos is in his thirties, more european than barbosa. he has a distinctly mild manner.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{who's grave?}
<A>__{an impudent question, but elias seems strangely bright eyed despite the guns held on him.}
<C>__{gallegos}
<D>__{my wife's. she died of leukemia three years ago.}
<P>__{(looks around)}
<D>__{i like to be among the dead. they never interrupt you.}
<P>__{(turning to them)}
<D>__{felix barbosa started out as a skinny fourteen year old fucking yankee businessman in bogata hotels. he grew up. he made himself strong and rich, but getting there made him sick, and that killed him. so he lost everything for the same reason he'd gotten it in the first place. now we'll see if you can do as well.}
<A>__{a priest going by greets gallegos who responds warmly. they chat a minute in spanish. the priest leaves.}
<C>__{gallegos}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{felix owed me one million eight hundred thousand dollars.}
<A>__{he addresses this to hull; elias feels left out.}
<C>__{gallegos}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{when you killed him, you bought the debt; now you owe it to me; you get to keep thirty percent, like he did. you have three days.}
<A>__{gallegos turns to leave.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{who did barbosa collect from?}
<C>__{gallegos}
<D>__{if you don't know, you shouldn't have killed him.}
<A>__{he notices hull's earring: two tiny dice, the spots made of minuscule jewels. unembarrassed, he fingers it.}
<C>__{gallegos}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{cute... can i have that?}
<A>__{without waiting for an answer, he yanks it out of hull's ear and walks away, leaving hull bleeding through his fingers before a stone cross.}
