<A>__{a shot of buddy outside on the patio, listening intently at the window. he leans forward with a keen interest, eyes wide.}
<L>__{interior hillyer home kitchen}
<T>__{cut to :}
<A>__{a shot close on daddy. he is peering intently at rose.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{what did you say, rose?}
<A>__{close on rose, as she turns, weeping.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{well, i was born on a farm myself... and i hate to think of the baby being born on one.}
<A>__{on them all. daddy and mother stare in shock at rose.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{what baby? what baby? what baby are you speaking about?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{mine.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{your baby?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{yes, mine. i'm going to have one.}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(he is "poleaxed," staggered)}
<D>__{good god almighty. this is a catastrophe, they won't hire her.}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(looks up, sees buddy in patio window)}
<D>__{brother, get out of that window!}
<A>__{buddy ducks down out of eight instantly. both mother and daddy, however, are too preoccupied and upset to be concerned with him.}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(stares off groggily into space)}
<D>__{this is a total catastrastroke. as of this moment i am stumped, i admit, i am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(as rose begins crying)}
<D>__{poor thing, don't cry, rose. i know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. who's the father, dear?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{well, i... i... i don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. it wasn't billy, i didn't know him.}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{i know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{well, now, mrs. hillyer, i... ah h, that's kinda hard to say.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{you're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. the problem is, what are we going to do?}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{that's why i'm asking her who the father is. it's the most vital question of all. who's the father, dear?}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(offhand; he is thinking hard about what to do)}
<D>__{she already told you, she doesn't know.}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(naively)}
<D>__{but she must know... unless... unless... rose, was there more than one person?}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(weeping in handkerchief)}
<D>__{oh h, mrs. hillyer, i... i can't think. i... i'm not really sure.}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(gently, a tiny frown, a bit shocked)}
<D>__{rose, really, you shouldn't act like that.}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(weeping)}
<D>__{oh, i know. but i didn't, really. honestly, i didn't. there was only one, but he's out of town and leave no forwardin' address.}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(a brilliant idea)}
<D>__{ah, ha! hold the phone! no forwarding address, huh?}
<P>__{(turns to mother)}
<D>__{in the shock of this brilliant move, i forgot something.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{what did you forget?}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{i forgot that rose will lie like a child. she's no more pregnant than i am, she just doesn't want to go to that farm!}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{yes, i am.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{no, you're not.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{yes, mr. hillyer, i am.}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(triumphant, sure he's right)}
<D>__{all right, tell us, rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(simply)}
<D>__{i haven't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big.}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(again "poleaxed" for a}
<D>__{moment, but pulls himself}
<P>__{together)}
<D>__{i don't believe it.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{it's so, mr. hillyer.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{all right, damn it. we've seen you with your clothes off around here, stand up and pull up your dress and let's take a look!}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{honey!}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{she doesn't have to take her panties off, we can see her stomach with 'em on. all she has to do is pull up her dress and let us see her belly.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{well, all right, if you just won't believe me.}
<A>__{rose stands up.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{rose, you don't have to.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{i don't mind.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{now, you will see, she's lying like she always does that belly will be flat as a pancake!}
<A>__{rose lifts her dress and daddy leans forward eagerly to confirm his belief. rose stands there with her skirt lifted. she has on a pair of skimpy white panties. an unmistakable, definite protrusion can be seen in the area below her navel just above the line of her panties. a stupefied look is on daddy's face.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{i'd say about three months. are you satisfied?}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{i am poleaxed and in a non compos mentis condition. i wash my hands or the whole thing.}
