<A>__{snow covered hills thrust up out of a barren, white wasteland. no buildings, no animals... nothing. closer: the hills are more defined. rows of jagged peaks and a crazed pattern of crevasses. a fine `mist' of wind blown snow whips about this jumble of glinting ice. still closer: we track down through valleys, skirt crevasses, climb peaks and finally pause on a flat stretch of ice. hold on this scene of timeless, savage beauty, then... thud!!! a face, hooded and goggled in ecw (extreme cold weather gear) drops into frame, smashing down on the icy surface with such brutal impact, the shattered goggle shield pops out eyes stare blankly into camera locked in death. it's a man. camera slowly starts to pull back to see his limbs have snapped at unnatural angles, the head grotesquely twisted bright red arterial blood seeps from the corpse and spreads out down tiny cracks in the ice until, with startling speed, it turns dark and freezes. we pull back further and look down on the body, a bizarre shape in a spider's web of frozen blood. and slowly we pull back... further and further...until all is dazzling white. title: whiteout}

<D>__{sorry, a professor sapperstein needs to see you in biology. said it's urgent.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{alright }
<A>__{jamie leaves. as carrie gets to her feet, camera moves away from her, panning around the small office. half packed up boxes lay strewn about the floor. a calender hangs crookedly before a desk. each day has been marked off with a large x. three days remain unmarked. last space reads: winter over, and in the space next to it, there's a cut out picture of a tropical beach. a dart board is next to it with a photograph pulverized with dart holes over the bullseye. it's of a candy striped pole topped with a silver ball, surrounded by international flags the south pole. carrie is standing next to the pole, smiling at the camera, arm in arm with sam murphy (30's). looks like he's handsome, but his face is a little more obliterated than the rest of him.}

<L>__{interior outlying building hallway right after}
<A>__{just as carrie and delfy leave the lounge, her perifocal vision picks up a wisp of light from a flashlight, which bled out from a door's threshold halfway down the hall. delfy's eyes go wide carrie's finger goes to her mouth shhhhh. she instinctively pulls her baton with her left hand, but it hurts. she shifts it to the other. she turns off her light. delphy does the same. motions for him to stay put. she heads to the source, keeping her baton ready and her back tight to the wall. gets to the edge of the door. it's open just slightly looks in. sees a man in an ecw jacket with his back to her, holding a flashlight in one hand and digging through a duffle bag with his other. items are strewn. another bag has been completely turned inside out. she enters. baton cocked.}

<D>__{who are you?}
<A>__{delfy comes up behind her.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{robert pryce. i'm a united nations observer for the oceanic and antarctic section. if you relax, i've got my id.}

<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{you must be stetko }
<A>__{this throws her.}
<C>__{pryce }

<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{i realize that, but considering the time constraints we're up against, let's be honest, taping and bagging everything isn't going to be an option.}
<C>__{carrie}

<A>__{a faint beeping noise emanates from her gps.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{this is it.}

<C>__{delfy}
<D>__{there's nothing here.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{just stop.}
<A>__{delfy pulls to a stop. they exit the cat.}
<L>__{exterior ice field day}
<A>__{all three get cold cocked by an invisible wind. carrie steps away from the cat. pryce does too. her eyes scan the ice with cool appraisal. it's completely flat. desert like.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{you sure this is right?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{section 104. these are the coordinates.}
<C>__{delfy}
<D>__{maybe you wrote them down wrong.}
<A>__{carrie ignores him. walks further away from the cat. ice crunches under her feet as she keeps looking then, she stops. something's not right. looks down. kneels to the ice. scoops some up. checks it out. perplexed. pryce approaches from behind.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{this is shaved ice.}
<A>__{she gets to her feet. walks further her eyes now paying close attention to the texture of the ice. after a dozen steps, texture changes. ice is now smooth like it's supposed to be. she turns around. tries to get the bigger picture. looks at the ground all around her. realizes a large area has been blanketed with shaved pieces of ice a few inches thick }
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{they were digging, pryce. and they tries to spread the ice to hide it.}
<A>__{she heads back across the area. scans the horizon. takes another step forward. whoosh! in an instant, carrie's gone! disappears below the ice. only a four foot wide hole remains, that was covered up with a white, iced over tarp. pryce and delfy move toward her each hesitating slightly, unsure of their own footing. pryce gets to the hole. looks down. carrie is precariously dangling in an ice shaft that slopes at a slight angle. she's managed to grasp a protruding piece of ice, but she's fighting the pain in her left hand to hold on. it slips off. below her nothing but darkness.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{grab me!}
<A>__{pryce lays flat. reaches his hand down six inches too short. delfy appears from behind.}

<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{i'm slipping!}

<D>__{almost got you.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{i'm losing my grip.}

<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{marshal?}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{...i'm okay.}
<C>__{delfy}
<D>__{saw a rope in the cat.}
<A>__{delfy springs to his feet.}
<L>__{interior ice shaft same}
<A>__{darkness. a flashlight clicks on. reflects off a wall of ice with a frozen blood trail leading up. carrie gets to her feet. sees that she's in a small dug out area. as she slowly turns to get her bearings, her light falls on an escape hatch of some kind, maybe three feet high. carrie shines the light to her feet. the ground beneath her is metal.}
<L>__{interior ice shaft right after}
<A>__{pryce, with a flashlight in hand, lowers himself down a rope to the bottom of the shaft where carrie waits. delfy follows. both take in the discovery. carrie moves over to the hatch. pulls on it. opens easily. she and pryce hit the interior with their lights. find themselves staring into...an airplane!}
<L>__{interior cargo bay continuous}
<A>__{off their lights every surface scintillates with ice crystals from the frozen atmosphere, undisturbed except for recent tracks of footprints filing in and out they go forward and aft, disappearing into darkness. place is tomb silent. twisted, and strewn with large containers scattered at odd angles victims of an intense impact. the plane is pitched up at the nose, making their footing precarious.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{cargo plane, but i don't recognize it.}
<C>__{delfy}
<D>__{it's an antanov 74. russian made late fifties. no one's put these in the air for forty years.}
<A>__{carrie shuffles her way forward into the darkness, heading for the cockpit. something brushes her leg. she spins. shines her light which illuminates a hand, fingers in a clawed position as if in excruciating pain. she whips her light past the hand, up the arm captures the face of a man staring at her! it takes a moment to realize he's dead, pinned between two large metal crates. delfy stands still. staring. carrie throws a look back over her shoulder }
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{guess that makes three.}
<A>__{she continues on with delfy staying close. her light targets the cockpit door. it's closed.}
<L>__{interior cockpit right after}
<A>__{carrie pushes the door open. the beam of her light reveals frozen blood splattered across a shattered windshield chunks of ice protruding through it. continues over three dead men in flight suits still strapped into seats, their broken bodies and ghastly expressions perfectly preserved. each have a sidearm holstered around their waist.}
<C>__{delfy}
<D>__{this isn't funny }
<A>__{she looks back to delfy gets confused.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{where's pryce?}
<L>__{interior cargo bay right after}
<A>__{trailing her beam of light, carrie and delfy climb through a thick wall of nylon webbing. enter a cluttered cargo area. ransacked antarctic gear is strewn everywhere in a tangle of ropes and crampons, old ecw gear, and boxes of supplies. dipping into a case of bottles, delfy pulls one free, sniffs, and drinks.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{what is that?}
<A>__{delfy grins.}
<C>__{delfy}
<D>__{vodka.}
<A>__{carrie continues through the hold. her flashlight beam flickers over more chaos of the crash. huge steel tanks take up most of the mid section. spots pryce's flashlight holding on something just ahead. moves to it.}
<C>__{carrie}
<P>__{(suspicious)}
<D>__{find what you're looking for?}
<A>__{her light hits pryce, who is focused on a heavy steel cage welded into the airframe. incredibly strong. and inside it is a steel safe. door is open. pryce takes a beat turns to she and delfy.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{just answers.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{those are fuel tanks behind you. this plane was outfitted for long range capabilities.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{and by the looks of that safe, must've been transporting something pretty important.}
<A>__{carrie moves in closer. sees that the cage has been breached. part of it has been damaged by the crash and this weakness has been ruthlessly attacked by the previous intruders until they forced an opening. discarded tools litter the floor.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{they put some serious work into this.}
<A>__{there's a pool of frozen blood near the opening where one of the torn, jagged bars of the steel cage is covered in blood }
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{whoever got hurt, they dragged him out of here. there's blood all over the tunnel.}
<A>__{she uses her light to examine the interior of the safe more closely the frost on the shelves exposes six round rust rings where containers have been removed. each one roughly measuring a foot tall, four inches wide. the plane suddenly trembles.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{what is that?}
<A>__{the muffled roar of a diesel.}
<C>__{delfy}
<D>__{it's the cat!}
<A>__{crash! the unmistakable sound of falling ice.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{go!}
<A>__{crashcrashcrash! more ice. they scramble back through the darkness, the flashlight beams swinging wildly about the hold. more ice falls. it's getting louder as they're getting closer to the source. carrie targets ahead with her light illuminates the hatch as a load of ice drops in covering it completely. light fades.}
<C>__{delfy}
<D>__{sonofabitch!}
<A>__{the continual sound of falling ice grows muffled and}

<A>__{shakes his head no.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{someone followed us.}
<L>__{interior plane at the hatch later}
<A>__{chipchipchip! ice is flying. things are desperate as a single flashlight beam propped up on a crate, illuminates carrie, delfy and pryce hard at it frantically chopping away at the ice filled hatch with pieces of scrap metal from the plane. efforts are big but the progress minimal.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{this isn't going to work, it's like digging through concrete with a spoon.}
<P>__{(beat)}

<C>__{delfy}
<D>__{no way. i'm not going out like this. no way.}
<A>__{the light from the flashlight slowly begins to fade. carrie goes over to the crate, slaps it against her leg, trying to get more juice going. still fading. light goes out screen goes black. can't see a thing. a second later, another light kicks on pryce is holding it. hands it over to carrie }
<C>__{delfy }
<D>__{and when that one goes we're screwed.}
<A>__{carries mind whirls with her lack of options, then }
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{what about the vodka we could make some torches, maybe melt the ice?}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{fire will burn the o2 quicker.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{what choice do we have?}
<A>__{pryce knows she's right. delfy looks to them both. desperate.}
<C>__{delfy}
<D>__{don't need my vote.}
<A>__{pryce heads to the back, his body becoming barely visible in the dissipating range of light. carrie takes a six inch, pearl handled buck knife from a pocket, unfolds it starts cutting the liner of her coat. delfy moves to a nearby wooden crate. goes to lift it, but it's frozen to the floor. stomps on it. it breaks. pulls pieces from the siding for torch sticks. pryce comes back with a couple bottles. stops dead in his tracks. carrie looks over to see him staring at two life jackets attached to the wall near the hatch. he's thinking. he moves to carrie }
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{hold these.}
<A>__{he exchanges the bottles for her flashlight. he shines the light to the ceiling as he heads toward the back, leaving carrie and delfy getting swallowed in the dark.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{what're you doing?}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{all these planes used to have bail out hatches.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{we came in through it.}
<A>__{pryce goes back into the cargo area.}
<C>__{pryce }
<D>__{has to be more than one.}
<C>__{delfy}
<D>__{it'd be on the ceiling in case of an ocean landing.}
<A>__{carrie watches pryce's flashlight moving about in the cargo area of the aircraft.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{found it!}
<A>__{carrie and delfy get to pryce. they follow his beam straight up to expose an escape hatch in the roof of the fuselage.}
<C>__{pryce }
<D>__{with the angle of the plane, i don't think we're that far from the surface. give me a hand.}
<A>__{pryce moves to a large crate starts to push it over. they join, sliding it over below the hatch. he jumps up onto it examines the hatch area.}
<C>__{pryce }
<D>__{these are explosive bolts. if we blow the hatch, maybe it'll smash a hole up through the ice.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{or, if the ice is too thick the blast will come right back at us.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{we can be blown up, suffocate or freeze to death. take your pick.}
<A>__{pryce hands carrie the flashlight. she targets the hatch area as he opens an electrical panel beside it; a crisscrossing maze of wires. as he reaches up to examine the wiring, carrie catches a glimpse of a shoulder harness under his liner.}
<C>__{pryce }
<D>__{this could work give me the battery from your phone.}
<A>__{as he looks down, carrie masks her discovery. hands over her phone. he extracts the battery.}
<C>__{pryce }
<D>__{when i connect these two wires, hopefully there's going to be a big bang. may want to take some cover.}
<A>__{pryce is nervous himself as he places one selected wire onto the battery, and prepares for another. he looks to carrie and pryce who have backed up against the fuselage.}
<C>__{pryce }
<D>__{you guys ready?}
<A>__{delfy nods. carrie is still running that shoulder holster through her head. pryce touches the last wire to the battery. nothing happens. hope freezes. pryce tries again ka boom! the hatch explodes inward, ricocheting around the inside of the cargo hold like a giant bullet coming in and out of their light. slam, slam, slam, until...wham, it buries itself edge on, halfway into the fuselage, missing carrie by a hair's width. they stand there, deafened and stunned, then a shower of ice rains into the plane where the hatch used to be and a thin shaft of light drops into the cargo bay like a gift from god.}
<C>__{delfy}
<D>__{hallelujah }
<A>__{pryce drops down. moves to another crate.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{delfy, help me with this. we'll need to get up higher.}
<A>__{delfy moves forward to help. the two of them push it over. it's a strenuous lift to get it on top of the other. just as they finish, pryce turns to find himself facing carrie holding one of the russian's guns to his face.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{don't move.}
<A>__{pryce stares at her in disbelief.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{delfy}
<D>__{yeah what're you doing?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{our friend here isn't who he says he is.}
<A>__{she reaches into pryce's liner, pulls out his sidearm from the shoulder holster. switches it with the one in her hand. puts the russian gun in her coat pocket.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{didn't you know it's a direct treaty violation to carry a firearm down here?}

<A>__{she raises weiss' arm. more stitches. she cuts through them. skin splits to reveal the bottom of a cannister that's been stuffed inside his chest. she reaches in and pulls it out. even has rust on the bottom. carrie's confused it's not like any of the cannisters pryce showed her photos of. it look more like}
<B>__{the ice core container she saw at mcmurdo.}
<A>__{she contemplates opening it for a moment, then places her hand on the top. begins to twist. it loosens easily. pulls the lid off. looks at it. whatever it is, it's frozen. tilts the can slightly, and out slides a foot long ice core sample. can't quite figure it out, until she shines her light on it the freezer dances with glistening light. the core sample is packed full of diamonds. she looks to the other two bodies. she opens mooney's bag. sees his chest is uneven more cylinders inside. repeats the action with rubin. same thing. carrie slowly stands the betrayal almost too much.}
<C>__{doc }
<D>__{if they had just gone along with it.}
<A>__{she turns doc is standing right behind her.}
<C>__{doc }
<D>__{those fools found a plane had no idea what they stumbled onto. turns out the russians had discovered a diamond field while drilling for core samples in the sixties.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{and we thought it was nukes the whole time.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{keller said he knew someone in the states who could move the diamonds for us. it was a hell of a lot of money.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{how did you get wrapped up in thing, doc?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{weiss got hurt on the plane. they were afraid to move him, so mooney called me. keller and i flew out. but they couldn't get the safe open keller found a way.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{then weiss got cold feet. it got ugly, didn't it and keller killed him at delta one one. everything went to hell after that, didn't it, doc.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{keller thought he could kill his way out of this whole thing.}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{if those idiots hadn't panicked, none of this would have happened.}
<A>__{he turns and walks out of the freezer.}
<L>__{interior science lab continuous}
<A>__{carrie carefully follows. sees he's heading for keller's ice axe in the ready room, that someone's removed from being wedged outside, onto the now uprighted lab cart pryce used to bust open the door.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{doc stop.}
<A>__{he does. turns back to her. but there has been a subtle shift inside him something illogical.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i will cut you in, carrie. there's at least 5 million in diamonds in there. that can buy both of us a nice life back in the world. how many times have we both talked about having a fresh start. well, this is it. those beakers finding that plane was a sign. a sign telling me it was time to go back. now i have something to go back for.}
<A>__{she has a realization.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{there is no granddaughter, is there? this was about greed, plain and simple.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{no one will ever know. it's just me and you. we can take care of pryce.}
<A>__{his callus disregard for human life rocks her.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{dead is dead, right?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{yes, yes, now you're getting it.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{what's happened to you? there are four people dead! four! people we knew.}
<A>__{doc looks at her. she's not sure if it's registering.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{where you going to stuff my body too? huh? was i going to be five?}
<A>__{he turns back to the ice axe and starts walking towards it. she pulls the gun out from inside her liner, her mind a whirl of limited options and grim solutions. he nears the ice axe on the cart carrie cocks back the trigger }
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{i won't go through it again. don't make me shoot you, please.}
<A>__{her knuckle on her trigger finger goes white as she wrestles with her emotions.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{it's either ignore all of this or kill me and you and i, we're too good of friends for me to force you to make that choice.}
<A>__{with that...he walks right past the ice axe and into the ready room. she's confused.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{doc, your not thinking straight.}
<A>__{but he's not listening.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{ya know, it's really warm. i'm gonna take a walk try and cool off.}
<A>__{the temperature gauge on the wall reads: 82. he looks at her.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{doc, please.}
<A>__{carrie crosses the room as he grabs onto the outside door's latch. he musters a smile }
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{remember, carrie freedom's just a sunrise away.}
<A>__{using both hands on the latch, he pulls. the door blasts open, filling the space between carrie and doc with violent winds and blowing snow. doc's throws one last look to carrie, then takes two steps out the door. disappears into the blanket of white. wind and cold storm into the room against carrie, who remains standing still like a statue. emotionally drained. numb. freezing to death tears frozen to her cheeks. a shadow passes by her it's pryce. he's hunkered over in pain, but forcing himself against the driving force of the wind into the ready room. latches onto the door. it takes everything he's got, but he manages to get it closed. instant silence. cold to the bone, he grabs a jacket off the racket. approaches carrie, who remains staring at the closed door. the effects of the chill and doc's decision apparent. pryce wraps the coat around her shoulders. gently leads her away.}

<A>__{the sounds of lapping surf and distant seagulls serenades us like a rhythmic lullaby as we cu on sand with a shadow of a palm tree casting over top of two pairs of feet intertwined. slowly widen to see carrie and pryce, kicking back on lawn chairs, side by side. two heat lamps pouring out bright, warm light. a cut out piece of paper in the shape of a palm leaf is taped to one of the lamps throwing the shadow. pryce has a small bandage over his shoulder. carrie lies back, rests, eyes closed.}

<A>__{they lie there quietly, relishing the moment.}
