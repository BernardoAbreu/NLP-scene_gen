<A>__{bill, starla, kylie, and trevor step slowly out of the car. they look around the deserted road. the wide open night is shrouded in darkness. quiet. they can see the lights of wheelsy down the road in front of them. bill speaks into the radio again, as he gets his leather satchel of weaponry out of the trunk. trevor grabs ammo from the satchel to reload his pistol.}

<B>__{moments later}
<A>__{the foursome walks down the road, toward the city. starla and bill are in the lead.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{hey, starla.}
<A>__{she looks at him.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{was always curious why you... married grant in the first place... just never seemed outta love.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{i know what people say, bill. i... remember, back in high school i worked at my father's gas station?}
<A>__{bill nods.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{grant used to get filled up every day. i knew it was just to see me. he was too old but he was handsome. and he had that big ol' lincoln then. i flirted with him.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{well, big ol' lincoln, sure. guess i would have flirted with him too.}
<A>__{starla smiles, thinks.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{my father, he was he was real close to evil. people didn't know. still don't. from the time i was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. i don't mean just like a smack for smart mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. and when i turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse.}
<A>__{starla looks at bill, who seems struck.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{when you wanted to run away, i called your dad.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{that wasn't a good night, no.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{starla shrugs it off.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{anyway, grant rolls in one day. i fill his tank with like an eighth a gallon as usual. and he notices my lip's all swollen up, and starts asking me how it happened. i don't know why i chose then, why grant i guess i saw an opportunity. and i told him everything, first time i told anyone. grant was furious. he picked up a tire iron, walked straightaway into the garage, and beat my father half to death. you say it's not about love, bill. but that was the closest thing to it i ever knew.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{grant asked me to marry him a few weeks later. i felt... safe with him.}
<A>__{bill nods. starla looks at him, smiles.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{after all this shit tonight, i know for sure now you regret not running off with me to hollywood!}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{hell, starla. i always regretted that.}
<A>__{starla looks at him, moved. trevor looks at kylie, shivering and terrified.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{don't worry, kid. pretty soon, we'll be in town, everything'll be fine.}
