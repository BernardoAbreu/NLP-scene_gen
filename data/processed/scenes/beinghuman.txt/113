<L>__{exterior beach evening}
<A>__{the remains of the cow hang on the spit over the large fire the survivors have made on the beach. small groups of people sit around it, gnawing on the roasted flesh. the image is once again timeless, the elements of it simple; man, fire, flesh, food. one cow doesn't go far between a hundred starving people. some are still on their feet by the large fire. now and then a hand will dart out over the flames to snatch a bone hanging loose or a tasty looking piece of gristle. they are the survivors of the pack, if any will be. hector is, of course, among them. he risks the searing heat to pull at a couple of blackened bones. he sees nuno, the boy he chased away from the girl earlier in the day. nuno is sitting by himself, staring vacantly at the fire, licking his fingers. hector sits down in the sand beside him. nuno hardly notices him until hector offers him one of his bones. nuno grabs it.}
<C>__{nuno}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{suck out the marrow... it's the best bit.}
<A>__{nuno follows hector's example. hector allows him to feel the benefit of his gift before he starts to talk.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i'm sorry about today...}
<C>__{nuno}
<D>__{it doesn't matter...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{but it does... it was mean of me... i was upset at something... i wasn't really angry at you...}
<C>__{nuno}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{nuno is taking it rather well. hector regains his natural self confidence.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{you don't think too badly of me?}
<C>__{nuno}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{you still like me?}
<A>__{nuno shyly nods his head.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{you do?}
<C>__{nuno}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{hector is satisfied now.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{well, that makes me feel better... we all have to like each other... and respect each other... that's important too.}
<A>__{they are silent for a moment.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{if you don't respect me, just say so...}
<A>__{nuno looks at him, smiling weakly. then he turns away in silence. hector tries another approach to win the boy over.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i have a boy like you... maybe you could meet him when we get home...}
<A>__{this doesn't produce much of a response. hector tries again. he starts to chuckle to himself and nudges nuno in the ribs.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{you can take her back there tomorrow, eh?}
<A>__{nuno shakes his head.}
<C>__{nuno}
<D>__{no... she's sick now...}
