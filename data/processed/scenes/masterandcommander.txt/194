<L>__{195. wide on the ship night}
<A>__{three flares soar and burst with a ghostly glow, making a pool of blue light around the ship, the sound continuing to echo and re echo from somewhere beyond.}
<L>__{196. quarterdeck night}
<A>__{the light illuminates the half hour glass, its top half empty of sand. like everyone else, the duty sergeant stands frozen to the spot. jack rounds on him.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{sergeant, what the devil are you thinking of? turn the glass and strike the bell.}
<A>__{roused, the duty sergeant turns the glass and time resumes its flow. two bells are hesitantly rung and the crew regain the power of motion, their limbs still spastic with fear. and when the sound comes once more they all freeze. jack joins mowett at the taffrail. the thing is somewhere out there, whatever it is.}
<C>__{mowett}
<D>__{perhaps some poor shipwreck?}
<A>__{he shouts, a slight nervous catch to his voice.}
<C>__{mowett }
<D>__{ahoy! is anyone there?}
<A>__{part of him knows it's crazy and of course there's no reply. the sound constantly shifting position, now in the water, now in the sky. jack turns to see a white face, frighteningly close to his own. it's padeen, mouth agape, face unnaturally white, staring into the gloom as though drawn to whatever horror lies out there.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{padeen. what are you doing on the quarterdeck?}
<A>__{he looks down at the press of men who have gathered at the bottom of the ladder, some with weapons.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{below! all of you men below!}
<P>__{(to mowett)}
<D>__{tell the bosun those off duty may sleep with their lamps on.}
