<A>__{jacob is driving a mail truck through the crowded streets of midtown manhattan. as he drives he is humming to himself a rendition of al jolson's "sonny boy." jacob stops his truck in front of a laundry on west 46th street. he opens the back door and pulls a stack of boxes toward him. he lifts them with effort and slams the door with his foot. it doesn't close. he considers giving it another whack but the boxes are heavy. he turns instead and waddles toward the store.}
