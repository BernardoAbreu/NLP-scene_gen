<A>__{racine appears at a run from the fog. he has the bum with him, grasped firmly at the neck of the collar and the seat of his pants. racine is forcing the bum to run along with him. the bum is mightily confused, not least by the fact that racine has jammed the baseball cap all the way down over his nose he can see nothing. racine lets go, hurtling him across the sand.}

<D>__{get the hell out of here and don't come back.}
<A>__{the bum is sprawled in the sand. the baseball cap has come off. he watches racine's dark figure recede in the fog.}
