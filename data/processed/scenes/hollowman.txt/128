<A>__{linda slips into her apartment and the door closes behind her. a moment later we see the doorknob turn back and forth. it's locked.}
<L>__{exterior alley night}
<A>__{on a fire escape, we see the ladder shake and descend to the ground. the metal rattles back and forth as if something were climbing it. we slowly crane up the fire escape and hold on a window. through the wispy curtains and dirty glass we can see linda enter the room. the panel of glass fogs from sebastian's breath. the fog wipes away, seemingly by itself. but then through the window we see matt walk into the living room and put his arms around linda's waist. we hear a shocked intake of air. he kisses her neck and then slowly unzips her dress. her dress falls to the floor. matt takes off his sport coat and drapes it over a chair, while linda unfastens the buttons of his shirt. they're laughing now, exchanging kisses. matt reaches behind linda and unhooks her bra. he kisses his way down her neck to her breasts. linda pulls him to her. suddenly the window shatters. startled, both matt and linda jump back covering themselves. we hear sebastian's footsteps as he retreats down the fire escape. a moment later matt reaches the window and peers out. he sees the fire escape ladder slowly rise back up down below.}
