<D>__{you mad at me?}
<A>__{max nods. fletcher's at a loss for how to begin. then:}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{you wanted me to stop lying. but lying isn't the problem. .. why we lie that's the problem. sometimes we lie to make someone else feel better. but sometimes we lie because the truth gets in our way...}
<P>__{(touches him)}
<D>__{but being an adult means you sacrifice some things for more important things. much more important things. i was so stupid, max.}
<P>__{(pointing to his own head)}
<D>__{malfunction in vector one. all this time you've been here and i could see you anytime i felt like it. and i... didn't. please don't go to boston. max, i love you more than anything else in the world and you know it's true. i couldn't say it if it weren't true. not today.}
<A>__{a moment as max studies his father, then:}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(to audrey)}
<D>__{he's telling the truth, mom. he's not allowed to lie. i made a wish and anything dad says has to be the truth.}

<D>__{right?}
<A>__{but fletcher's looking at his watch...}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{max. .. it's 9:22.}

<D>__{what?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{max, you made the wish at 9:15. i've been able to lie for the last seven minutes.}
<A>__{max steps away from fletcher.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{so then, you were...}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{no! it wasn't a lie. i just wanted to be honest with you and tell you there was no wish to guarantee it anymore. you just have to believe me.}
<A>__{max looks at audrey, who is letting max decide for himself max looks at fletcher and tries to decide.}
