<A>__{they round a corner and flush a covey of bats. marion screams.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{don't do that. it scares me.}
<A>__{marion gives him a look. they round a corner and begin a walk through a maze of chambers that present for their inspection: moldering mummies and stacked sarcophagi; a room decorated with a thousand human skulls; a wall crawling with huge scarabaeid beetles. marion is quite naturally a nervous wreck; she jumps when indy grabs her suddenly and points.}
