<A>__{khan occupies the captain's chair. we pull back: the crew of the reliant has been replaced by khan's fol lowers in their odd looking clothes. at the helm is joachim, khan's lieutenant. he is in the largest and brightest of khan's group. terrell sits in the first officer's chair, chekov at the comm console. their behavior is normal, save for subtle hesitation, symptoms of their mind controlled state.}

<D>__{when i was a guest aboard her some years ago, captain kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals. and now, mr. chekov, let us review: you say you have no details of project 'genesis' ?}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{beyond what i told you, sir, it is classified information.}
<C>__{khan}
<D>__{umm. and would admiral kirk have access to such information?}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{i would think so, sir. he's on the fleet general staff.}
<C>__{khan}
<D>__{then to whom do you report directly regarding genesis?}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{to doctor marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on space laboratory regula i.}
<C>__{khan}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{i see. helmsman?}
<C>__{helmsman}
<D>__{aye, sir.}
<C>__{joachim}
<D>__{may i speak? we're all with you, sir, but consider: we are free, we have a ship and the means to go where we will. we have escaped permanent exile on ceti alpha v. you have proved your superior intellect and defeated the plans of admiral kirk. you do not need to defeat him again.}
<C>__{khan}
<D>__{he tasks me and i will have him. i will chase him round the moons of nibia and round the antares maelstrom and round perdition's flames before i give him up.}
<P>__{(as no one speaks)}
<D>__{prepare to alter course for space station regula i.}
