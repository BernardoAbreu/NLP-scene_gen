<L>__{interior under the underground night}
<B>__{angle on pillar}
<A>__{very close on its upper left section. we are looking at a hole in the pillar that matches the pattern of the shard on the box.}
<T>__{cut to wide:}
<A>__{the club is empty. the dim lighting of working hours has been replaced with the sickly gleam of one or two fluorescent tubes and the club has that eerie not quite right look that all night places have when subjected to a harsher light. two workers are in the final stages of clearing the night's debris emptying trash into big black plastic bags, wiping down tables and bars etc. work completed, they head to the main exit. one of them hits the light switches so that the fluorescent clarity is again replaced by the more appropriate dim lighting. the other shouts across the apparently deserted club.}
<C>__{worker}
<D>__{all done, mr. monroe.}
<A>__{they stand a second but no response comes. the first turns to the second and shrugs.}
<C>__{worker}
<P>__{(mouthing silently)}
<D>__{ass hole.}
<A>__{his co worker grins and they let themselves out. a beat. another door opens into the club and jp monroe the club's owner and the man we saw buy the pillar walks into the main room of the club from his private room at the back. jp walks out into the shadowed darkness of his small kingdom. he describes a circle around the dance floor, throwing glances at his odd sculptures, and finally walks into the center of the room to stand before the pride of his collection, the pillar. the pillar of course is stationary at this time, though it is still mounted upside down. jp smiles possessively at the pillar and then registers the mutilation where the box has been ripped away.}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{what the ... ?}
<A>__{he leans in closer to stare at the hole. suddenly, jarringly, there is a quiet but distinct squeak that seems to come from within the hole. jp starts back a little, a small expression of anxiety on his normally supercilious face. he glances to right and left, gets a grip, and leans forward again. angle on pillar hole as, again, the noise comes. is it a squeak or is it the creaking shifting of hidden machinery, hidden chains? jp's hand moves tentatively into shot, approaching the hole. slowly, slowly, it reaches wrist deep into the blackness.}
<B>__{angle on jp}
<A>__{very close on jp's face quizzical, enquiring ... and suddenly contorted in pain!}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{aaaaaahh!!}
<A>__{angle on pillar hole as jp's hand whips out of the hole, shaking in shock and pain. a rat is hanging on to one of jp's fingers, its sharp teeth buried in the flesh! jp swings his arm violently through the air, dislodging the rat with the force of his swing. a spray of blood is seen to come from jp's wounded finger.}
<B>__{angle on rat}
<A>__{ as it lands heavily in a shadowed corner of the club and scurries away deeper into the darkness, squeaking furiously.}
<B>__{angle on jp}
<A>__{ as he looks down at his finger, face snarling.}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{son of a ...}
<B>__{angle on finger}
<A>__{very close. blood seeps from the tiny teeth marks.}
<C>__{jp}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{... bi ...}
<A>__{jp's voice is cut off by a strange sizzling noise heard off. jp's face moves up to look at the pillar. a look of awe and shock crosses his face.}
<B>__{angle on pillar}
<A>__{some small drops of blood stand out bright red on the blackness of the pillar. the sizzling noise is coming from them. suddenly the drops draw together magically into one large ruby of blood already larger than possibility would allow. then it gets wierder; the blood suddenly dissipates into six or seven little rivulets that begin to run down the pillar. the streams of blood don't simply fall straight. they seem to follow some pre gouged pattern, running down the pillar tracing the blackened organic contours of the carvings. they all culminate at the point of pinhead's chin and then separate again, running over his frozen black face along the carved scar lines that make a matrix across his features. when every canal line on the demon's face is filled neatly with blood, a blue light seems to glow from within the pillar through pinhead's face, giving it temporarily the blue tone he had enjoyed in (un)life.}
<B>__{angle on jp}
<A>__{close on his awe struck face bathed in reflected blue light.}
<B>__{angle on pinhead}
<A>__{ as gradually the blueness subsides again, the visible blood vanishing with it, leaving the same frozen implacable blackness as before but charged now with a waiting power.}
