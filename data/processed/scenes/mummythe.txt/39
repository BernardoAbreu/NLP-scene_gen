<D>__{seems the americans had a little misadventure of their own today, three of their diggers were killed.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{salt acid. pressurized salt acid. some sort of ancient booby trap.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{maybe this place really is cursed.}
<A>__{a gust of wind blows through the camp. the campfire flickers o'connell and jonathan share a nervous look. evelyn laughs.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{you two!}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{you don't believe in curses, huh?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{no. i believe if i can see it and i can touch it, then it's real. that's what i believe.}
<A>__{o'connell cocks his rifle, ka chank! gives her a big grin.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{i believe in being prepared.}
<A>__{jonathan opens the warden's pouch, the one that held the scarabs. he reaches in, starts scrounging around. we slowly push in. waiting for the attack. the music builds. and then, jonathan screams in pain and rips his hand back out of the pouch. o'connell and evelyn both jump.}
<D>__{o'connell evelyn what?! what is it?!}
<A>__{jonathan sucks his finger, then reaches back into the pouch and pulls out a liquor bottle, the top has been chipped off.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{seagrams!}
<A>__{jonathan smiles at the bottle, then turns the pouch inside out and shakes it, nothing but sand is inside it.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{well, he may have been a stinky fellow,... but he had good taste.}
<A>__{jonathan takes a swig. o'connell and evelyn laugh, guiltily and then o'connell suddenly kneels down and sticks his ear to the sand. evelyn and jonathan watch him. a beat. and then a barage of gunfire is heard coming from the american camp. o'connell jumps up and throws the elephant gun to evelyn.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{stay here!}
<A>__{he takes off running through the ruins. evelyn immediately gets up and runs after him. jonathan grabs a gun, holds the bottle of seagrams; tight and dashes after her.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{evy! excuse me! but didn't the man just say !}
