<A>__{the land cruiser haytham rammed driver's side crushed, bullet holes, out of control skid marks, asphalt scars from the snapped drive shaft... fleury is moving around the scene, restaging the shoot out. instantly lining up the angles. leavitt's taking digital snaps of the shattered land cruiser. through the viewfinder: the caved in door. two snaps. a sang passes adam, his gun aimed a touch high.}

<C>__{fleury}
<D>__{they got into the compound. somehow...took control of this vehicle. i'm guessing they didn't politely ask whoever was in this car if they could take it for a little ride?}
