<L>__{exterior ferry day}
<A>__{the ferry's the only means of travel south, and it's packed. gordy picks his way through. the only other gringo on the boat is a geek in a plaid shirt and gimme hat that says "deerborn." the geek, philip armstrong, looks like a talker, and gordy tries to avoid eye contact. he's too late.}
<C>__{armstrong}
<D>__{hey, yo, dude, here's a seat, man!}
<C>__{gordy}
<D>__{no, that's okay }
<A>__{but armstrong's already throwing a bag off the bench.}
<C>__{armstrong}
<D>__{i was hoping for someone i could communicate with.}
<A>__{he sees gordy hasn't moved.}
<C>__{armstrong}
<D>__{only room's at the back near the bano, and i'd advise against it, unless you like poop.}
<A>__{beat. gordy sits. immediately }
<C>__{armstrong}
<D>__{philip armstrong. assiniboia, sasketchewan, canada.}
<P>__{(indicates his hat)}
<D>__{deerborn heavy equipment.}
<C>__{gordy}
<D>__{... gordy pitt.}
<C>__{armstrong}
<D>__{hey, howya doing? i love germany.}
<C>__{gordy}
<D>__{austria. american now.}
<C>__{armstrong}
<D>__{i love america. never been to austria. where from in america would that be?}
<C>__{gordy}
<D>__{new york city.}
<C>__{armstrong}
<D>__{i don't like new york city. buildings're too big. what kinda work you in?}
<C>__{gordy}
<P>__{(hesitates, then)}
<D>__{coffee. i buy beans.}
<C>__{armstrong}
<D>__{can't drink caffeine. makes my stomach do the rumba. i like that commercial guy with the sombrero and the mule, though. headed upstream, eh? where to?}
<C>__{gordy}
<D>__{caguan.}
<C>__{armstrong}
<D>__{... you've never been to caguan, eh?}
<C>__{gordy}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{armstrong}
<D>__{'cause no one in their right mind would ever go back. caguan's in the guerrilla zone run by the e.l.c. e.l.c. as in 'extra loathsome communists.' they don't care, and they kill. i'm going there myself. but i have a 'get outta jail free' card.}
<A>__{armstrong doffs his cap, undoes a safety pin securing a card inside the crown. shows it to gordy. sotto }
<C>__{armstrong}
<D>__{e.l.c. travel pass. i can go anywhere i want.}
<P>__{(by way of explanation)}
<D>__{everyone needs equipment fixed.}
<A>__{armstrong carefully returns the card to the hat. and now his voice takes on a noticeably more measured tone }
<C>__{armstrong}
<D>__{if you don't have one of these, you don't want to be up there, gordy.}
<A>__{beat. gordy's contemplating the warning, when his eyes go to a small, sleepy boy standing nearby on the cramped deck, leaning against his father. gordy reaches over and taps the boy. the boy looks over. shrinks away at the sight of the large gringo. the father notices and looks at gordy, who stands, indicates his seat.}
<C>__{gordy}
<D>__{por favor.}
<A>__{the father's also apprehensive, doesn't move.}
<C>__{gordy}
<D>__{con mucho gusto.}
<A>__{finally, the father accepts, sits down with the sleepy boy on his lap. nods his thanks at gordy, who then gazes down at the son. a kid about matt's age. armstrong recognizes the look of a caring dad.}
<C>__{armstrong}
<D>__{got kids, eh?}
<A>__{off armstrong, as gordy walks away...}
