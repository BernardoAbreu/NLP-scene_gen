<L>__{exterior outside the house later that night}
<A>__{a car sits, cloaked in shadows. inside sits our friend, the watcher. once again we see the watcher's knife once again he manicures his nails with it, almost delicately, as he watches the house. it's dark a single light glows behind a window on the third floor. sam's room.}
<L>__{interior sam's room same time}
<A>__{sam has pushed all the furniture aside to make enough room to do a martial arts form. right now he's frozen, one leg extended in a kick, balancing on the other leg. now a knock at his door seconds later, it opens. deirdre stands there, watching as sam holds his position for a beat more, and then retracts his leg.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{i feel as if i've wandered onto the set of enter the dragon. could you teach me to do that?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i didn't think to see you again tonight. you were pretty pissed.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{i still am.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{is that right?}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{that's right.}
<A>__{deirdre spings at sam, throwing martial arts combinations at him: punch followed by kick, elbow strike followed by palm thrust. sam parries her blows as she drives him across the floor until he's got his back to the wall. their movements are controlled, but powerful, and there's something almost flirtatious about the whole thing. now deirdre throws one last punch which sam ducks. he slips behind her and suddenly they square off in earnest. the previous martial arts stuff was a kind of choreographed exercise, but now they spar for real they never hit one another, but they come awfully close, hands and feet whizzing through the air, throwing rapid fire combinations and techniques. they're not angry, but they're not kidding, either. finally deirdre feints a punch that distracts sam's attention from the kick she throws right behind her punch, and she smiles as whump! sam wasn't distracted at all he drops to the ground beneath her kick and catches her standing leg with a sweep which takes her to the ground and now she's trapped beneath him. the two of them are breathing hard from the exertion, their faces close to one another, shining with sweat and excitement and we've gone from flirting to an almost primal seduction, and with their faces only inches apart deirdre leans in to kiss sam, and he's about to meet her half way when he pulls back.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{part of me says i should just look at this as a perk. you know, a bonus. but then i remember you're you deirdre who used to belong to the ira and it occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge come very naturally to you.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<P>__{(kissing him very lightly)}
<D>__{nobody's saying they don't.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(returning the kiss, just as lightly)}
<D>__{and when i consider that, i have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{i probably do.}
<P>__{(pulling him close)}
<D>__{but for the time being, i'm willing to forget about it...}
<A>__{they finally kiss, slowly and then building in intensity, and as they start to make love the camera moves up through the building, floor by floor, until we've reached }
