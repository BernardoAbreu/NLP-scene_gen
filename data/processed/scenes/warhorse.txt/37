<L>__{exterior village square. the same.}
<A>__{the recruits march through town under pennants and the strains of a familiar song("the jolly plowboy") it is a song they all know, which means a lot to them full of soul a song of harvest or a celtic hymn, something relating specifically to the lives they have led together. everyone of every age everyone in the village knows this song it is theirs. nicholls passes in his car and we see those they are leaving behind cheering a whole generation of young men is marching off to war. one girlfriend rushes up to kiss her leaving boyfriend. albert watches joey, then remembers the campaign pennant dangling from his pocket. he runs up to joey }
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{joey...}
<A>__{ and tucks the pennant into joey's halter.}
<C>__{sam perkins}
<D>__{here now, i've told you sling your hook!}
<A>__{but nicholls intervenes from his car.}
<C>__{captain nicholls}
<D>__{let him be, perkins.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{this isn't the end. this isn't the end, my brother... i, albert narracott, solemnly swear we will be together again. wherever you are, i will find you. and i will bring you home!}
<A>__{and then they are past him, leaving him behind. as perkins leads joey across a stone bridge, albert watches from the bank of the stream. joey balks one last time }
<C>__{sam perkins}
<D>__{whoa. steady, steady. steady now, come on. walk on! walk on now, come on!}
<A>__{ then perkins leads him away, leaving albert behind. the very last recruits leave the village leaving the debris of this army's visit strewn on the square. like the debris of a party you are already beginning to regret.}
