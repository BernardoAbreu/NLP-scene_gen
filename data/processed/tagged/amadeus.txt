<A>__{total darkness. we hear an old man's voice, distinct and in distress. it is old salieri. he uses a mixture of english and occasionally italian.}
<C>__{old salieri}
<D>__{mozart! mozart! mozart. forgive me! forgive your assassin! mozart!}
<A>__{a faint light illuminates the screen. flickeringly, we see an eighteenth century balustrade and a flight of stone stairs. we are looking down into the wall of the staircase from the point of view of the landing. up the stair is coming a branched candlestick held by salieri's valet. by his side is salieri's cook, bearing a large dish of sugared cakes and biscuits. both men are desperately worried: the valet is thin and middle aged; the cook, plump and italian. it is very cold. they wear shawls over their night dresses and clogs on their feet. they wheeze as they climb. the candles throw their shadows up onto the peeling walls of the house, which is evidently an old one and in bad decay. a cat scuttles swiftly between their bare legs, as they reach the salon door. the valet tries the handle. it is locked. behind it the voice goes on, rising in volume.}
<C>__{old salieri}
<D>__{show some mercy! i beg you. i beg you! show mercy to a guilty man!}
<A>__{the valet knocks gently on the door. the voice stops.}
<C>__{valet}
<D>__{open the door, signore! please! be good now! we've brought you something special. something you're going to love.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{valet}
<D>__{signore salieri! open the door. come now. be good!}
<A>__{the voice of old salieri continues again, further off now, and louder. we hear a noise as if a window is being opened.}
<C>__{old salieri}
<D>__{mozart! mozart! i confess it! listen! i confess!}
<A>__{the two servants look at each other in alarm. then the valet hands the candlestick to the cook and takes a sugared cake from the dish, scrambling as quickly as he can back down the stairs.}
<L>__{exterior the street outside salieri's house vienna night}
<A>__{the street is filled with people: ten cabs with drivers, five children, fifteen adults, two doormen, fifteen dancing couples and a sled and three dogs. it is a windy night. snow is falling and whirling about. people are passing on foot, holding their cloaks tightly around them. some of them are revelers in fancy dress: they wear masks on their faces or hanging around their necks, as if returning from parties. now they are glancing up at the facade of the old house. the window above the street is open and old salieri stands there calling to the sky: a sharp featured, white haired italian over seventy years old, wearing a stained dressing gown.}
<C>__{old salieri}
<D>__{mozart! mozart! i cannot bear it any longer! i confess! i confess what i did! i'm guilty! i killed you! sir i confess! i killed you!}
<A>__{the door of the house bursts open. the valet hobbles out, holding the sugared cake. the wind catches at his shawl.}
<C>__{old salieri}
<D>__{mozart, perdonami! forgive your assassin! piet! piet! forgive your assassin! forgive me! forgive! forgive!}
<C>__{valet}
<P>__{(looking up to the window)}
<D>__{that's all right, signore! he heard you! he forgave you! he wants you to go inside now and shut the window!}
<A>__{old salieri stares down at him. some of the passersby have now stopped and are watching this spectacle.}
<C>__{valet}
<D>__{come on, signore! look what i have for you! i can't give it to you from down here, can i?}
<A>__{old salieri looks at him in contempt. then he turns away back into the room, shutting the window with a bang. through the glass, the old man stares down at the group of onlookers in the street. they stare back at him in confusion.}
<C>__{bystander}
<D>__{who is that?}
<C>__{valet}
<D>__{no one, sir. he'll be all right. poor man. he's a little unhappy, you know.}
<A>__{he makes a sign indicating 'crazy,' and goes back inside the house. the onlookers keep staring.}

<C>__{valet}
<D>__{did he open?}
<A>__{the cook, scared, shakes his head: no. the valet again knocks on the door.}
<C>__{valet}
<D>__{here i am, signore. now open the door.}
<A>__{he eats the sugared cake in his hand, elaborately and noisily.}
<C>__{valet}
<D>__{mmmm this is good! this is the most delicious thing i ever ate, believe me! signore, you don't know what you're missing! mmmm!}
<A>__{we hear a thump from inside the bedroom.}
<C>__{valet}
<D>__{now that's enough, signore! open!}
<A>__{we hear a terrible, throaty groaning.}
<C>__{valet}
<D>__{if you don't open this door, we're going to eat everything. there'll be nothing left for you. and i'm not going to bring you anything more.}
<A>__{he looks down. from under the door we see a trickle of blood flowing. in horror, the two men stare at it. the dish of cakes falls from the cook's hand and shatters. he sets the candlestick down on the floor. both servants run at the door frantically once, twice, three times and the frail lock gives. the door flies open. immediately, the stormy, frenzied opening of mozart's symphony no. 25 (the little g minor) begins. we see what the servants see.}
<L>__{interior old salieri's salon night}
<A>__{old salieri lies on the floor in a pool of blood, an open razor in his hand. he has cut his throat but is still alive. he gestures at them. they run to him. barely, we glimpse the room an old chair, old tables piled with books, a forte piano, a chamber pot on the floor as the valet and the cook struggle to lift their old master, and bind his bleeding throat with a napkin.}
<L>__{interior ballroom night}
<A>__{twenty five dancing couples, fifty guests, ten servants, full orchestra. as the music slows a little, we see a masquerade ball in progress. a crowded room of dancers is executing the slow portion of a dance fashionable in the early 1820's.}

<A>__{as the fast music returns, we see old salieri being carried out of his house on a stretcher by two attendants, and placed in a horse drawn wagon under the supervision of a middle aged doctor in a tall hat. this is doctor gulden. he gets in beside his patient. the driver whips up the horse, and the wagon dashes off through the still falling snow.}

<D>__{herr salieri?}
<A>__{old salieri turns around to look at him. we see that his throat is bandaged expertly. he wears hospital garb, and over it the civilian medal and chain with which we will later see the emperor invest him.}

<D>__{i admit i was jealous when i heard the tales they told about him. not of the brilliant little prodigy himself, but of his father, who had taught him everything.}
<A>__{the piece finishes. leopold lowers the lid of the harpsichord and lifts up his little son to stand on it. mozart removes the blindfold to show a pale little face with staring eyes. both father and son bow. a papal chamberlain presents leopold with a gold snuff box whilst the cardinals decorously applaud. over this scene old salieri speaks.}
<C>__{old salieri }
<D>__{my father did not care for music. he wanted me only to be a merchant, like himself. as anonymous as he was. when i told how i wished i could be like mozart, he would say, why? do you want to be a trained monkey? would you like me to drag you around europe doing tricks like a circus freak? how could i tell him what music meant to me?}

<A>__{a fantastic room designed as a rocky grotto, lit by candles. a forte piano to one side is being played by schikaneder: the music of ich mochte wohl der kaiser sein cross fades to another tune. this is vivat bacchus from il seraglio which schikaneder, dressed as bacchus, is humming as he plays. the music is actually accompanying a game of forfeits, which has begun. five couples (the group we have just seen) are dancing in the middle of a ring made by nine chairs. when the music stops they will each have to find a chair, and the one who fails must pay a forfeit. constanze is dancing with leopold; mozart is dancing with one of the actresses; the two other actresses are dancing with two other gentlemen; and two children dance together a little boy and a little girl. the scene is watched by a circle of bystanders; among them from the doorway is salieri. schikaneder stops playing. immediately the couples scramble for the chairs. leopold and constanze meet on the same chair, bumping and pushing at each other to get sole possession of it. to the amusement of the people around, the chair over balances and they both end up on the floor. constanze immediately gets up again, sets the chair on its feet, and tries to pretend she was sitting in it all the time. but schikaneder calls out from the forte piano.}

<D>__{no, no! you both lost. you both lost. you both have to forfeit. and the penalty is you must exchange your wigs.}

<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{no, please! this is ridiculous! no, please!}
<A>__{despite his protests an actress takes off his hat, to which the smiling mask is attached, to reveal his outraged face showing a very different expression underneath. another actress snatches off his wig to reveal very sparse hair on the old man's head. the third actress takes constanze's wig from mozart and attempts to put it on his father's head.}

<D>__{oh no, papa, please! don't spoil the fun. come on. here, take mine.}
<A>__{he takes off his own wig and puts it on leopold's uncovered head. the effect, if not as ridiculous, is still somewhat bizarre, since wolfgang favours fairly elaborate wigs. he takes constanze's wig from his father. as this happens, the music stops again. mozart gently pushes his father down onto a nearby chair; the others scramble for the other chairs; and he is left as the odd man out. he giggles. schikaneder calls out to leopold from the keyboard.}
