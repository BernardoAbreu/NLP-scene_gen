<L>__{interior parlor day}
<A>__{... her parlor is a wonder of seedy faux middle class victoriana. little knickknacks, dusty plants and dingy doilies. there is a threadbare mauve sofa in front of a comfortable fire. a faded picture postcard of the seaside hangs on a wall. she goes to a sideboard and pours him a huge glass of gin as:}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{isn't this homey now? me cheery wallpaper was a real bargain too, it being only partly singed when the chapel burnt down ....}
<A>__{she hands him the gin. he gulps it down, washing the taste of her pie out of his mouth.}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{there's a good boy, now you sit down and warm your bones, you look chilled through.}
<A>__{he sits before the fire:}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{isn't that a room over the shop? if times are so hard, why don't you rent it out?}
<A>__{she glances up at the roof, considering the room over them.}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{up there? oh, no one will go near it...}
<A>__{she turns to him, something a little intense and probing about her gaze.}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{people think it's haunted.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{haunted?}
<A>__{she holds his gaze.}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{and who's to say they're wrong? ... you see, years ago, something happened up there. something not very nice...}
<A>__{the flickering flame from the fire begins to cast a more intense red glow on her face...}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{there was a barber and his wife, and he was beautiful, a proper artist with a knife, but they transported him for life.}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{and he was beautiful...}
<A>__{the music continues as she looks at him, again with that rather intense gaze:}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{barker, his name was benjamin barker.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{transported? what was his crime?}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<P>__{(with an edge)}
<D>__{foolishness.}
<A>__{she turns again to the fire, the red glow bathing her face as she remembers...}
