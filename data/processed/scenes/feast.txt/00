<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{exterior desert day}
<A>__{the white sun beats down on the rocky terrain. there's not a cloud in the blue sky and the wind is at a standstill. far in the distance, a medium sized flat bed truck makes its way to the entrance of a large cavern opening. two vultures perched on a barren tree watch the intruders.}
<L>__{exterior desert day}
<A>__{the truck screeches to a dusty stop. three men in matching coveralls and hard hats jump from the cab: chief (42, stocky, weary), lanky (32, withered) and college boy (23, clean cut and naive). chief holds a map and glares into the howling black mouth before them.}

<D>__{why did it have to be these caves...}
<C>__{college boy}
<D>__{is something wrong?}
<C>__{lanky}
<P>__{(to college boy)}
<D>__{don't mind me, buddy. it's nothin'.}
<A>__{chief grabs a flashlight and moves to the back of the truck. the logo on the rear gate reads "wigwam waste management."}
<C>__{chief}
<D>__{let's get that first barrel.}
<A>__{the gate drops revealing their full load of yellow barrels bearing the familiar biohazard waste symbol.}
