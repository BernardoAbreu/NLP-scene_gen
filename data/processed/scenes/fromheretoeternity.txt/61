<L>__{interior gymnasium day}
<B>__{full shot}
<A>__{raucous, hammering music sweeps away the melancholy blues. on the floor of the gym dhom is punching the bag. in a corner of the raised ring ike galovitch is skipping rope. in the center of the ring thornhill and henderson are sparring. holmes hovers beside them, issuing instructions in a strident voice.}
<B>__{medium shot prew}
<A>__{he is in fatigue clothes, on his knees, scrubbing the floor. there is an expression of stubborn hate on his face. above his head in the shot are galovitch's feet jumping the rope. in b.g. of shot is wilson, seated near ring.}
<C>__{galovitch's voice}
<D>__{some day you get sense in your dumb head, prewitt, you be up here instead down there!}

<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{still makin out you like it, huh?}
<B>__{medium shot in ring}
<A>__{there are two water buckets near galovitch. he skips near one of them, kicks it. the bucket falls on its side and dirty water spills over the ring and down onto prew.}
<C>__{galovitch}

<A>__{prew gets to his feet. galovitch resumes skipping rope.}
<C>__{galovitch}
<D>__{and look a life, hurry it up. you on fatigue detail, not vacation.}

<C>__{galovitch}
<D>__{clean up, prewitt!}
<A>__{prew suddenly stands, no longer able to contain his rage. he throws his sponge and scrubbing brush on the ring floor.}

<C>__{prew}
<P>__{(recklessly)}

<P>__{(furious)}
<D>__{sergeant galovitch, take this man to the barracks and have him roll a full field pack, extra shoes, helmet and all, and then take a bicycle and hike him up to kole kole pass and back. and see that he hikes all the way. and when he gets back, bring him to me.}
