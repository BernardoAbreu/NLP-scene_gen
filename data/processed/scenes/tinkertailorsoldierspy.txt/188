<A>__{... to reveal control peering out at us. he steps aside and allows a pre injury prideaux to enter.}
<L>__{interior control's flat night}
<A>__{the flat smiley visited. control leads prideaux into the same room the green armchair, surrounded by mounds of files and papers, over flowing ashtrays, the detritus of an obsession. the five photographs of faces fixed to the chess pieces before him. control, a walking corpse, lowers himself into the armchair, motions prideaux to take another seat.}
<C>__{control}
<D>__{you weren't followed?}
<A>__{prideaux sits, presuming the question is rhetorical.}
<C>__{control }
<D>__{trust no one, jim. especially not in the main stream. what hungarian identities do you still have running?}

<C>__{control }
<D>__{there's a rotten apple jim and we have to find it.}
<A>__{laboriously he leans forward to the chess set.}
<C>__{control }
<D>__{i'm so close i can almost feel his heart beating. i know it's one of five men. all i want from you is one word.}
