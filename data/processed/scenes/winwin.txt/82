<A>__{multiple pins. it's a bloodbath. jackie, abby and stella are in the stands and they look depressed. kyle's next up.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{ok. this is kenny randall. he's very good.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{yeah, i heard.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{but you have an advantage here, he has no idea who you are, right?}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{so he's gonna be overconfident. you take advantage of that and when you get your shot, put him away.}
<A>__{kyle nods and mike slaps him across the face and kyle sprints to his place on the mat and gets ready. mike turns to the team.}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{see how he runs out there? i want that kind of intensity from all of you.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{why did daddy hit kyle?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i don't know, honey.}
<A>__{the ref blows the whistle and the match starts. as mike predicted kenny randall tries to end the match quickly with a throw but kyle is too strong and too good. kyle counters and throws kenny to his back. before anyone can blink, kyle pins him. mike, terry, and vigman explode off their chairs.}
<D>__{mike (cont'd) terry}
<A>__{yeah! holy shit!}
<C>__{vigman}
<D>__{he just pinned kenny randall. are you kidding me?!}
<A>__{kenny randall looks shocked. he throws off his head gear and gets up. the milburn coaches look equally shocked. the ref raises kyle's hands. kyle runs over to shake the milburn coaches hand and then he runs back to his bench and is greeted by mike.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{he know's who i am now.}
<A>__{mike smiles as the team greets him.}
