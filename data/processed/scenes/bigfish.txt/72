<L>__{exterior the dark forest night}
<A>__{various shots: edward negotiates the thorns in his bare feet. it's horrible. almost unendurable. and then it gets worse. the trees ahead are moving. at first, it just seems to be the wind blowing the branches, but as we hear the wood cracking and groaning, there's no mistaking it: they're trying to block him. snake like white roots shoot out of the ground, grabbing for his ankles. he leaps up, kicking off one tree trunk to grab another one's branches. he swings off, lands and rolls. now all the trees are moving to block him, their dark shapes towering over him in the flashes of lightning.}

<D>__{as difficult as it was to reach spectre, i was fated to get there eventually. after all, no man can avoid reaching the end of his life.}
<A>__{as he ducks under branches, the chain holding the key to the city gets caught. he's almost strangled, but the chain finally breaks. the silver key disappears into the mud. scrambling forward, he looks for a way out. but the trees have encircled him, their spiky crowns bending down to crush him. he screams up at the night, until his breath is gone.}

<D>__{and then i realized, this wasn't the end of my life.}
<A>__{with a sudden calm...}
<C>__{edward}
<P>__{(aloud)}
<D>__{this isn't how i die.}
<A>__{another lightning flash, and suddenly the trees are back where they've always been. edward is lying shoeless and torn in a muddy puddle, staring up at the rain. and laughing.}
