<L>__{exterior brendan and tess' home late afternoon}
<A>__{the remnants of the birthday party lay strewn across the lawn. tess, in a cocktail waitress outfit, says goodbye to her mom and the kids, who play on the swing set. she walks toward the garage and enters to find brendan pressing free weights on an old bench.}
<L>__{interior garage continuous}
<A>__{brendan continues to lift as tess rushes in and tosses a bag of garbage in the bin. a deep cut, hidden earlier by the make up, is visible on his cheek.}
