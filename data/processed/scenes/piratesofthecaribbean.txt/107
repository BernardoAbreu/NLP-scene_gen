<A>__{pintel enters the cell. it appears empty but that's because will is hanging from the rafters, trying to shove up the ceiling planks with his legs.}
<C>__{pintel}
<D>__{that ain't going to work. that's the gun deck above yea}
<A>__{will drops lightly to the deck. suddenly:}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{what happened to william turner?}
<C>__{pintel}
<D>__{ah, william turner. stupid blighter. he threw in with us after we relieved jack sparrow of his captaincy, but turned out, it never sat well with him particularly after we found cortes' treasure, and its peculiar condition. he thought we deserved to be cursed, for leaving ol' jack to the fate we did. that's why he sent off a piece of the treasure to you, as it were: so it would never be recovered, and so cursed we_ remain.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{and then he ran. and he's hiding out someplace where you haven't been able to find him.}
<C>__{pintel}
<D>__{that's a nice thought, to be sure, and i wager your da wishes he'd thought it hisself. but, no. see, what he'd done, _ didn't sit too well with captain barbossa ... so he chained a cannon to his legs and dumped him over.}
<A>__{will reacts with shock at the account of his father's fate.}
<C>__{pintel }
<D>__{yep, last i saw of bootstrap bill, was his face looking up, as he sank down to the crushing black oblivion of davy jones' locker.}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{it was only after, we found out we needed his blood to solve the curse. that's what you call ironic.}
<A>__{barbossa appears behind pintel, flanked by several other pirates. he regards will for a moment, then:}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{bring him.}
