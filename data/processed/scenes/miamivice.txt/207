<A>__{prepares for the autistic son, not seeing behind him... aryan brother #3 rising from a bare mattress with an aluminum baseball bat, coming up behind tubbs. wide tubbs slips the autistic son, rotating his right arm around the kid's right arm, getting slashed on the back of his forearm, but grabbing the son's wrist as the momentum propels him past tubbs, who torques the wrist back. screaming, son's ruined wrist, tubbs took the knife, and as the aryan brother swings the bat... low angle: tubbs ducks the bat. it dents the faux wood paneling. tubbs slams the knife twice into the man's slide, doubling him up, leaving the ab brother to crawl, bleeding, with a 10 inch butcher knife through his kidney into his right lung... and tubbs' gun in his left hand has never moved off target of the aryan brother with the detonator in his hand the whole time until right now: he snaps a round into the wounded aryan brother's head. and, that fast, tubbs' gun is back on target. and the fierce eyes of bulked out brother a nihilistic smile dawns there.}
