<L>__{exterior neighborhood street morning}
<A>__{twin boys, rudy and jacob carges (12), ride their bikes through a suburban neighborhood. rudy, the more athletic of the two, rides at a breakneck pace. jacob rides slowly due to a hockey mask that he wears over his face. it's making it difficult for him to see. the boys turn down a dirt path and ride deep into some woods.}
<L>__{interior woods continuous}
<A>__{rudy and jacob ride to the edge of a clearing and stop. across from the clearing is a large oak tree, which has a tree house perched high up in it's branches. the boys cautiously look around and whisper.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you see `em?}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{no. but that doesn't mean they're not here.}
<A>__{after a beat, rudy gets off his bike and starts walking towards the tree house. jacob stays behind, eyeing their safety.}
<C>__{rudy }
<D>__{jacob, come on. it's cool.}
<A>__{suddenly, a rock comes careening from off screen. it hits jacob in the head and knocks him to the ground. rudy darts for the oak tree as a hail storm of rock and debris come flying at him. as jacob rises, a stream of blood pours down the front of his mask. he quickly runs for the tree. two boys, jeff and kenny (14), trailer park, punks come running out of the woods, rocks in hand. rudy and jacob climb the tree, using makeshift rungs that are nailed into the trunk. in the floor of the tree house is a door. rudy removes a key from a chain around his neck and unlocks it. he climbs inside and pulls jacob in after him.}
