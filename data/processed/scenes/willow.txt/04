<L>__{interior. dungeon day}
<A>__{silhouetted in sadows, three nockmaar minions stand guard. in a jail cell, sex fully pregnant women watch from behind iron bars. the screaming stops. there's a moment of silence. as we move into another jail cell we hear a slap and the first cry of a newborn baby. in the cell a black robed druid watches intensely as ethna, a midwife, leans over the mother and wraps the baby in swaddling.}
<C>__{druid}
<D>__{is it a girl?}
<C>__{ethna}
<D>__{it is a girl.}
<C>__{druid}
<D>__{show me its arm.}
<A>__{ethna peels back the swaddling. on the baby's arm is a small marking.}
<C>__{druid}
<D>__{it's true then. i must tell queen bavmorda.}
<A>__{with great urgency the druid hurries up the dungeon stairs. ethna gently places the baby on the mother's breast. the mother comforst the baby lovingly until it stops crying. then she reaches out and clasps the midwife's wrist.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{ethna, please. help me. they're going to kill my baby.}
<A>__{ethna nervously looks out at the guards, then shakes her head at the mother.}
<C>__{ethna}
<D>__{they'll kill you.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{please save my baby.}
<A>__{ethna hesitates. then decides. she quickly wraps to gether some rags and gives them to the mother.}
<C>__{ethna}
<D>__{pretend this is the child.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{thank you, ethna. thank you.}
<A>__{the mother kisses her baby and hands it to ethna, who hides the baby inside the basket of rags. ethna car ries the basket past the guards and up the stairs. the mother lies back and sighs with relief. then she hears clinking bootsteps and her eyes widen with fear. queen bavmorda sweeps down the dungeon stairs, her black robes flowing behind her. the druid hurries alongside.}
<C>__{bavmorda}
<D>__{we will start the ritual at dusk. you're certain this is the one?}
<C>__{druid}
<D>__{it bears the markings.}
<C>__{bavmorda}
<D>__{i must see for myself! just as the omen foretold!}
<A>__{the guards fearfully move aside as bavmorda enters the cell.}
<C>__{bavmorda}
<D>__{so. you were the one.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{yes. but nothing you can do will stop the prophecy.}
<C>__{bavmorda}
<D>__{this child will have no power over me....}
<A>__{bavmorda grabs the rags away from the mother and anxi ously tears them apart.}
<C>__{bavmorda}
<P>__{(furiously)}
<D>__{where's the baby!}
<A>__{one of the guards looks up the stairs.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{the midwife!}
<A>__{bavmorda flies into a rage.}
<C>__{bavmorda}
<D>__{find that baby! use the dogs! sorsha!}
<A>__{two guards draw swords and charge upstairs. bavmorda grabs the third guard and nods toward the mother.}
<C>__{bavmorda}
<D>__{kill her.}
<A>__{bavmorda storms away with the druid. we see the shadow of the guard move over the terrified mother. war drums begin to beat out an alarm.}
