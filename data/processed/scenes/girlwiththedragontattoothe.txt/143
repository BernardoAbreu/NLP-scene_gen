<A>__{the cat naps while blomkvist looks up the other leviticus quotes from harriet's list in her dog eared bible }
<D>__{harriet v o the daughter of any priest who profanes herself by playing the harlot, profanes her father, and shall be burned with fire harriet v o a woman who is a medium or sorcerer shall be put to death by stoning }
<A>__{there's a knock. he tucks the list in the bible, sets aside and answers the door. frode comes in.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{the good news is he survived. how he does now, we have to see. he's in icu. can i have one of those?}
<A>__{he points to the table.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{a sandwich?}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{a scotch.}
<A>__{blomkvist pours him one, and another for himself.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i don't want to be indelicate. but henrik promised me something when i agreed to do this.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{wennerstrom.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{i need to know what he has on him. now. in case.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{in case he dies? that is indelicate.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{and i apologize.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{i don't know what he has on him, if you're asking me. and he can't tell you in the condition he's in. so ... is that it then?}
<A>__{silence. blomkvist drinks. eventually }
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{we also never discussed who i'd report to if something happened to him.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{you'd report to me, but does it matter? we both know nothing's going to come of this.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i'm not so sure.}
<A>__{frode looks at blomkvist a little more intently.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i may have found something.}
<C>__{frode}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you're joking.}
<P>__{(blomkvist isn't)}
<D>__{what did you find?}
<A>__{now it's blomkvist who studies frode. he's not sure he wants to tell him. and even less so the longer he looks.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{the last time i reported something before i was sure of it, it cost me my savings.}
<A>__{frode studies him again wondering perhaps if blomkvist suspects him.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i need a research assistant. can you authorize that?}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{yes. do you have one?}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i can find one.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{i know a good one. she did the background check on you.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{the.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{do you think we'd hire anyone for something like this without doing one?}
<A>__{blomkvist's brain tries to quickly inventory his life, pausing at its darker recesses. frode nods.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{yes, it was quite thorough.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i want to read it.}
<C>__{frode}
<D>__{that i couldn't authorize.}
<A>__{blomkvist isn't sure how to play this. then he is. sets his napkin down, gets up and begins taking things down from the wall. frode watches. then sighs.}
