<L>__{intercut with:}
<B>__{...}
<L>__{interior police station office}
<A>__{a cop, detective stern, refers to a file.}
<C>__{detective stern}
<D>__{this is detective stern with the arson unit. we have some new information about the "incident" at your condo.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{detective stern}
<D>__{i don't know if you're aware... your front door it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no, i wasn't aware...}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{i am jack's cold sweat.}
<C>__{detective stern}
<D>__{does this sound strange to you?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yes, sire, strange. very strange.}
<A>__{jack starts to sweat, scrubs his pants obsessively.}
<C>__{detective stern}
<D>__{the dynamite...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{dynamite?}
<C>__{detective stern}
<D>__{yes. it left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. do you know what that means?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{detective stern}
<D>__{it means it was homemade.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{this is... really a shock...}
<C>__{detective stern}
<D>__{whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion. the gas, it seems, was just a detonator.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{who do you think could've done this?}
<C>__{detective stern}
<D>__{i will ask the questions, son.}
<C>__{tyler}
<P>__{(whispering in jack's ear)}
<D>__{tell him...}
<A>__{jack almost leaps out his skin, startled; looks to see tyler standing right next to him.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{tyler}
<P>__{(overlap w below)}
<D>__{"the liberator who destroyed my property has re aligned my paradigm of perception."}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{shhhhhh!}
<P>__{(into phone, overlap w above)}
<D>__{i don't know what to make of this, sir, i really don't...}
<C>__{detective stern}
<D>__{do you know anyone who'd have the expertise or motive to do something like this?}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{"i reject the basic assumptions of civilization, including material possession."}
<A>__{jack pushes tyler away, cups the receiving.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{no. no, sir. i loved that condo. i loved every stick of furniture. the lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me. the dishes were me. the plants were...}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{i'd like to thank the academy...}
<C>__{detective stern}
<D>__{well, if any ideas come to you, give me a call. in the meantime, don't leave town. i may need to bring you in for questioning.}
<B>__{end intercut}
<A>__{jack hangs up. tyler shrugs.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{could be worse. you could be cursed with the three terrible karmas. you could be beautiful, rich and famous.}
<A>__{jack turns away, continues to scrub his pants. marla's footsteps can be heard coming downstairs... jack really grinds the soap against the pants, splashing water. he turns, sees marla enter. tyler is gone. marla lights a cigarette.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{except for their humping, tyler and marla were never in the same room.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{i got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(keeps scrubbing)}
<D>__{worth every penny.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{my parents pulled this exact act for years one came in, the other disappeared.}
<A>__{marla begins a slow, exotic dance, moving very close to jack. she lifts her dress dangerously high, dancing close to jack's body, almost touhcing.}
<C>__{marla}
<P>__{(seductive)}
<D>__{it's a bridesmaid's dress. someone loved it intensely for one day, then tossed it. like a christmas tree so special, then, bam it's abandoned on the side of the road, tinsel still clinging to it...}
<A>__{jack becomes very aware of having no pants on, presses against the counter. marla pulls her hemline further up.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{like sex crime victims, underwear inside out, bound with electrical tape.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{it suits you.}
<A>__{she leans in very close to jack's ear, whispers hoarsely:}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{you can borrow it sometime.}
<A>__{jack takes a step away, keeps scrubbing. marla blows smoke in his face. jack takes her cigarette and throws it in the sink. marla backs away, fed up, storms out, going upstairs.}
<C>__{tyler }
<D>__{get rid of her.}
<A>__{jack turns to see tyler in the doorway.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you get rid of her.}
<C>__{tyler}
<P>__{(pointing at jack)}
<D>__{don't mention me.}
<A>__{marla's footsteps are coming downstairs. jack looks to the archway, then back at tyler's gone. marla enters, shoes and balled up clothing under one arm, looking for something on the junk strewn table.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{i'm six years old again, passing messages between my parents.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i, uh... think you should go now.}
<A>__{marla ignores, still searching the table, tossing things, pushing other things off to the floor.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it's time for you to leave.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{don't worry, i'm leaving.}
<A>__{marla finds what she wanted, a pack of cigarettes. she moves up into jack's face.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{you're such a nutcase, i can't even begin to keep up.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{goodbye.}
<A>__{she laughs, spins on her heels. as she exits the back door, she sings "this merry go round" from "valley of the dolls." jack watches her through the kitchen window.}
<C>__{tyler }
<D>__{nice work.}
<A>__{jack turns. tyler's right behind him. through the window, marla can be seen walking away. tyler picks up the remnant of soap jack's been using, holds it up to jack.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{to make soap, first we have to render fat.}
<A>__{jack looks at tyler. close up sign: "danger biohazard."}
