<A>__{kelly opens the screen door and pokes his head in. a family of chinese immigrants, the lings, paints canvases at long worktables. there's a mother, father mao, grandmother xiou xiou, son and daughter. finished canvases hang from the walls and lean in piles against it. all of them are portraits of animals. some have on hats or clothes. kelly's mom eve shows grandmother xiou xiou a few strokes with a paintbrush. eve wears jeans. she's one of those young looking mothers kelly's friends would have crushes on. if he had any friends.}
<C>__{mao}
<P>__{(to kelly)}
<D>__{son of eve. you are very dirty.}
<C>__{kelly}

<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(to kelly)}
<D>__{don't touch anything. we have to get ready for the starving artist show.}
<P>__{(to xiou xiou)}
<D>__{now nana, the gold has to be feathery, not gloppy see?}
<A>__{eve demonstrates on the painting a pair of monkeys in french court dress. kelly looks over his mom's shoulder.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{now you try.}
<A>__{grandmother xiou xiou dabs at the painting.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(to kelly)}
<D>__{she loves the gold. always overuses it. and usually her touch is so light. xiou xiou gold is the color of the sun.}
<A>__{eve moves along the row, stopping to look at the paintings in progress.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{you know why we never have anything to eat in this house?}
<A>__{but eve has stopped behind mao's painting. she's not paying attention to kelly.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{mao, what did we say about the eyes?}
<A>__{she gestures at the image of a horse done santa fe style, lots of pastels, very abstract. mao looks at her quizzically.}
<C>__{mao}
<D>__{more empathy?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{that's right. and didn't i tell you to put in more cacti?}
<C>__{mao}
<P>__{(shakes head)}
<D>__{no, no more cacti. too busy. simplicity is best.}
<A>__{his family nods in support of this rash aesthetic statement. eve rolls her eyes.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{oh boy. i'm not having this battle with you again.}
<A>__{kelly breaks in.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{because your husband takes food from his own family to feed every loser druggie in cleveland.}
<A>__{eve moves down the line.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{well, you can always chip in here. we're ordering pizza later.}
<A>__{at this the family nods and smiles to each other, pleased with the news.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{no. some people have to work later.}
<P>__{(casual)}
<D>__{will you drop something off at the dry cleaners for me tomorrow?}
<A>__{eve looks up at him for the first time. takes in his filthy uniform.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{sweetie, you know what we said about paying for the war things. nothing's changed.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{it's the only thing i ever ask you for }
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{don't be dramatic.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{but it's important to me.}
<A>__{eve stops at mother ling's painting.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{you're just going to have to find a way to pay for it yourself then, i guess.}
<P>__{(to mother ling)}
<D>__{no not that way the sky should be stormier. angry clouds.}
<A>__{mother ling looks up at kelly, who's scowling. she smiles and nods, understanding.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{why do i bother?}
<A>__{kelly leaves. eve's busy talking.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{more brown, less blue.}
