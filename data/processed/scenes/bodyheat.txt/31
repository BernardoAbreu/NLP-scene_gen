<L>__{interior matty's bedroom night}
<A>__{racine and matty lie under a sheet on her big bed. her eyes are closed. there are more wind chimes on the second floor of the verandah, which is off this room, and racine is listening to their tinkling. racine looks over in that direction. racine's pov. the moonlit, sheer white curtains on the window roil to a light breeze. racine's gaze travels over the luxurious bedroom; here too, it is in the thirties style. their clothes are haphazardly thrown across a divan and on the floor nearby. a delicate fern sways in the wind. finally, he is looking at a lovely writing desk against the far wall. some tissue thin stationery flaps in the breeze, kept in place by the weight of a pen. then, as he looks, the paper stops flapping and the chimes gradually stop tinkling. racine looks toward the window. it is still open, but the air had died.}
