<A>__{five of the boarders mr. and mrs. barley, mr. krull, helen benson and klaatu are finishing their sunday morning breakfast. mrs. barley is a middle class helen hokinson lady, form and unrelenting. her husband is a born complainer. mr. krull is a shriveled little accountant, precise and finicky. as they finish their coffee, all except helen are immersed in the sunday papers. helen seems preoccupied with her own thoughts. from a portable radio on the table comes gabriel heater's voice.}

<D>__{ and so, this sunday morning, we ask the question that's been plaguing; the entire nation for two days now: "where is this creature and what is he up to?" if he can build a space ship that can fly to earth and a robot that can destroy our tanks and guns what other terrors can he unleash at will? ...obviously we must find this monster. we must track him down like a wild animal and destroy him.}
<A>__{insert newspaper page in mrs. barley's hands it is a full page layout, in the style of the american weekly, showing a demented artist's conception of a mass invasion of space ships. weird looking creatures are slaughtering earth people with ray guns. the caption at the top of the image reads: "are we long for this world?" (gabriel heater's voice continues uninterruptedly over this and the next two scenes.) close shot klaatu he is reading his paper with considerable interest. insert newspaper story the third page story reads: savant calls meeting to study space ship. professor jacob barnhardt, world famous scientist and nobel prize winner, has invited fellow scientists from all over the world to meet with him in washington and study the recently landed "space ship." close shot klaatu his face is thoughtful as he finishes reading. this story seems to impress and interest him. then suddenly he finds his attention caught at what the radio voice is saying.}
<C>__{gabriel heater's voice}
<D>__{but where would such a creature hide himself? would he disappear into the north woods? or would he slither off into the sewers of some great city?}
