<L>__{interior hotel lobby day}
<A>__{as haven enters. shooting from his angle, we can see, as he does, mark crossing the street, apparently towards his law office. he is in such a hurry that he falls down, crawls a little, gets up, runs. just as he reaches the office door, just as his hand touches the knob, a shot rings out and he crumples. he still tries, then his hand slips from the knob and he lies there dead. the vacant street is empty with his death. haven stares. he takes a match from the counter, applies it to his pipe then finding the pipe empty, smiles thinly and pockets it}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(softly; turning to the clerk)}
<D>__{you didn't throw away that verse?}
<C>__{orville}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{you won't have to change it much.}
<A>__{he takes the little pistol from his pocket and glances at it. the clerk, watching, idly strumming the guitar string.}
<C>__{orville}
<D>__{you ain't going out there with that?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{not much, is it?}
<C>__{orville}
<D>__{you'll never get closer to having nothin' }
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(staring out)}
<D>__{no i won't.}
<C>__{orville}
<D>__{say }
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{yeh?}
<C>__{orville}
<D>__{i'm naturally sentimental, bein' a sort of poet.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{naturally.}
<C>__{orville}
<D>__{i keep a bunch of gimeracks an oldtime sheriff's gun, a bullet from a dead bandit, a rosary from some guy they hanged.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{that's nice. a hobby?}
<C>__{orville}
<D>__{in a way want to leave me something?}
<A>__{haven smiles. he feels in his pocket, comes out with the army button gotten at the sawmill.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{this is all i seem to have.}
<C>__{orville}
<P>__{(taking it)}
<D>__{army button.}
<P>__{(puzzled)}
<D>__{where's the uniform that goes with it?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{what do you want for }
<P>__{(he pauses as the idea hits him)}
<D>__{yeh? a very good question.}
<A>__{the clerk stares at him; haven smiles grimly. he breaks the little gun, checks it.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i might even know. i think i will try to go and find out.}
<A>__{he starts to the door, the little gun in hand; very slowly. watching him, the clerk twangs the strings softly. haven walks very slowly. he opens the door and hesitates. just as he is about to step out, looking up and down the street, there is a furor and the sheriff rides up outside and dismounts. starts over to inspect mark's body. he turns as haven walks on to the street, hands held high.}
