<D>__{c'mon, lisa. you're up nexterior}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i quit. and, uh, since my costume, y'know, was okay'd a month ago? i'm givin' it to amber.}
<A>__{amber breaks a smile. taped music ends. applause. gladys, mic in hand, joins becky for a big hug.}
<C>__{gladys}
<D>__{boy, i'd hate to follow that. wow!}
<A>__{becky exits, pulling the wheeled jesus behind her.}
<C>__{gladys }
<D>__{voice of an angel, that one.}
<A>__{iris runs self consciously out on stage, whispers in gladys' ear, then runs back off stage.}
<C>__{gladys }
<D>__{...uh, i was just told that contestant number seven, lisa swenson, has quite the pageant.}
<B>__{crowd reacts.}
<C>__{gladys }
<D>__{well, these things happen. at any rate, we still have one more contestant number eight, amber atkins.}
<A>__{gladys exits. a taped hip, hot drum beat starts. suddenly, amber glides into center spot. (now wearing lisa's costume, sleeves rolled up.) her feet burst into an amazing routine. the loud drum beats seem to fly from her hands and feet as they punctuate the rhythm. there's no glitz, just unbelievable skill. it appears effortless as she floats around stage. like watching michael jackson moon walk for the first time, you can't take your eyes off her. she concludes, center stage, with the greatest thirty seconds of her life. the audience goes wild! amber takes bow after bow they love her. gladys enters quickly, mic in hand.}
<C>__{gladys }
<D>__{okay, okay, okay! well, now, it's finally time to say good bye to our judges, so they can go make the toughest decision of their lives.}
<A>__{pan to judges. they look nervous as hell. a relaxed hank sniffs from a paint soaked bag.}
