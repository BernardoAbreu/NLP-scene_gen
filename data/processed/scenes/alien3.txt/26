<L>__{interior abbey lavatory night}
<A>__{an enormous room, over a football field in length, consisting of at least a hundred open toilet stalls facing a hundred wall mounted sinks. their condition, though, bespeaks the awful truth the stalls furthest away from us are cobwebbed. some have had the side walls stripped for fire wood. of the original hundred sinks, maybe twenty are still functional a facility created for a much larger number of colonists than are left. a skinny monk washes his hands.}
<B>__{in the stalls}
<A>__{moving down the row of stalls (chest high, thank you) past a few empty stalls and several grimacing faces, the second to last being the abbot }
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{cold tonight }
<A>__{ continuing to the last, bald tribunal member.}
<C>__{bald tribunal member}
<D>__{gets colder every night.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{and every day. never this bad. taken so much wood out of the structure the surface wind blows right through the colony. right under the floor }
<A>__{the bald tribunal member shivers as a cold breeze runs along the waste trough under the floor and chills the air in his bowl.}
<C>__{bald tribunal member}
<D>__{right up your bloody backside. nights like this make me miss plumbing ack !}
<A>__{he feels a tugging at his bowels it's not piles. a beat.}
<D>__{abbot o s what?}
<C>__{bald tribunal monk}
<D>__{i don't aah }
<A>__{the bald tribunal monk screams as something grabs him from below (note: the left half of the following 5 pages is cut off. i have completed the text to the best of my ability.) something snakes up his rectum and hooks into his lower intestine! he convulses in spasms of agony. there is a terrible ripping sound as the bald tribunal monk is pulled violently down out of frame we pan back down the row of stalls tight on each sitting monk and see their horrified reaction as they feel the alien drag the bald tribunal monk's body away under them... the abbot in his stall he pounds on the wall }
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{matthew? matthew? jesus, what's wrong?}
<A>__{skinny monk washing his hands, sees all this. looses control of his bodily functions as blood sprays from the faucet }
<B>__{other monks}
<A>__{in their stalls as the toilets reject a torrent of gore! blood and viscera spraying the walls converting the abbey into an abattoir.}
