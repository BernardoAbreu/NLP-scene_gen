<A>__{a handsome and elegant hotel perched on the mountain side overlooking the french resort town. a large, open sun deck tables, gaily colored parasols, sun bathers. one of the latter is regina lampert, a lovely young girl. she is, besides taking in the sun, involved in her favorite activity eating. then a dark, ominous shape intrudes in the f.g. focus changes to bring into sharp relief a revolver shining, black and ugly in the sunlight. reggie, unaware of her danger, continues to eat. the finger tightens around the trigger and finally the gun shoots a stream of water arcs, with unerring aim, straight into reggie's face.}
