<L>__{exterior basketball court day}
<A>__{angle on: a wall. we see the following graffity: "jimmy best on his back to the suckerpunch of his childhood years" a basketball bounces against a wall. jean and benny amble onto a basketball court. jean's changed his hairstyle. now the dreadlocks stand straight up from his head. benny dribbles with skill while jean puffs furiously on a cigarette. he doesn't look like he's slept, but he's happy. benny throws the ball to jean. it bounces off a puddle and splashes jean.}

<A>__{he shoots again. swish.}
<C>__{benny }
<D>__{and you gotta do your work all the time when you're not doing that. the same kinda work, the same style over and over again, so people recognize it and don't get confused. then, once you're famous, you have to keep doing it the same way, even after it's boring unless you want people to really get mad at you which they will anyway.}
