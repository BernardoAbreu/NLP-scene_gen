<A>__{hannah's book release party. great turnout. her professional photo adorns a poster announcing the publication of sleeping on the moon. boy, hannah looks terrific in that photo. richard hovers around the makeshift bar, drink in hand. maureen, looking radiant, accepts the congratulations of well wishers. table prominently centered has piles of hannah's novel, waiting to be signed. hannah talks to the camera, looking especially radiant. this is her day and she is more than ready for her close up. totally different in wardrobe and appearance.}
