<L>__{interior gare de l'est, paris day}
<A>__{we follow the legs up the steps, across the concourse, through the station. men turn and stare. cara mason (30, stunning) shows no sign of noticing. she wears dark glasses and carries a traveling bag in one hand, a copy of the international herald tribune in the other.}
<L>__{interior brasserie, gare de l'est day}
<A>__{a young waiter wiping down the bar stops to watch cara enter and take a seat at a table slightly set apart. an older waiter approaches her. they exchange a few words and he walks toward the bar.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{she's waiting for someone.}
<C>__{younger waiter}
<D>__{probably waiting for me.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{the door's waiting for you if you don't get back to work.}
<A>__{a messenger clad in leather, wearing a motorcycle helmet, enters the cafe and looks around. he consults a photograph. his eyes land on cara. he walks over and holds out a document sized envelope.}
<C>__{messenger}
<D>__{c'est vous, mademoiselle?}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{oui.}
<A>__{as the messenger walks away she opens the folder and shakes out the contents. there is a ticket for the orient express and a handwritten letter... she spreads it out on the table like a precious treasure map. her beautiful forehead creases with concentration as she reads...}
<C>__{alexander's voice }
<P>__{(english accent)}
<D>__{they are following you cara.}
<A>__{she looks up. takes out a small makeup mirror and holds it in front of her face to glance around behind her...}
<D>__{alexander's voice (v.o.) (cont'd) they think you'll lead them to me. but if you follow my instructions closely, there is a way for us to get away...}
<A>__{cara scans the rest of the letter. camera glides down to see the signature at the bottom: "love, alexander." we barely have time to read this before cara's perfectly manicured hand crumples the letter, places it in a saucer and sets fire to it. the young waiter hurries over, alarmed.}
<C>__{younger waiter}
<D>__{mademoiselle! je vous en prie }
<A>__{cara is already gathering her things and walking away.}
