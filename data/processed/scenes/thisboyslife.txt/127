<A>__{his mood even fouler, toby toils at his paper route. he throws the papers against the houses with all his might. suddenly chuck bolger's car screeches to a stop next to toby. we hear psycho's "arghhh!" and toby climbs into the car.}
<L>__{exterior derelict crusher plant night}
<A>__{we see the concrete silo dimly lit in the distance. we can read "welcome to concrete" on it. toby is leaning against a wall in a large derelict concrete plant staring at the silo. behind him is a small campfire where the other guys are slumped around talking. toby takes a long, angry pull on a bottle of whiskey, then turns around and heads toward them.}

<A>__{toby topples over and falls down a bank of rubble. the other burst out laughing and hooting. the camera moves off them and cranes down to a spread eagled toby's face. the laughter echoes around the building. toby begins to laugh, but it soon turns to bitter tears.}
