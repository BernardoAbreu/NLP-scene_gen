<C>__{mini }
<D>__{would he follow?}
<A>__{his face and shoulders glisten with sweat, as she lifts one leg around his waist and then the other. as she straddles him, their hips rocking together, she puts her arms around his neck and leans all the way back, her hair hanging down in ecstasy. as she pulls herself back up, her eyes scan the room. martin stands in the back, watching her, his eyes sullen.}
<C>__{mini }
<D>__{was there any question?}
<A>__{mini's eyes move quickly enough past him that it's ambiguous to him whether she spotted him or not. martin watches as mini leans in and in slow motion gives her partner a deep, long kiss. martin looks ill.}
