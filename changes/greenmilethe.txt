Made it race against time...Once I built a railroad, now it's done...Brother, can you spare a dime... Opening credit sequence plays against footage of the Great Depression, images haunting and sepia-toned, defining an era. The bread lines...the soup kitchens...the dust bowl refugees heading west with their possessions on their backs and no hope in their eyes...the strutting gangster royalty flaunting their bootleg riches...an entire generation of lost youth riding the rials...the U.S. army troops raining truncheon blows on the half-starved and forgotten veterans of World War One as "Hooverville" is set afire in the very shadow of the nation's capitol... All these faces, all these lives, in a world not really so very long ago...}

He pauses, horrified, seeing the scrap of cloth. He pulls it loose, turns back, screaming something in anguish... ...and still more men come crashing into view, flooding by us with dreamlike, slow-motion grace.

He curls his free hand around the back of Percy's head, pulling him ever closer... ...and Percy's screams are muffled as their mouths come together. Coffey begins exhaling as if he'd held his breath for hours. Percy jerks like a fish on a hook, but can't get away. The men jump in, try to pry Percy loose, hollering for Coffey to let him go. The black "insects" are flowing from Coffey to Percy, swirling into his mouth, up his nose, down his throat. Several lightbulbs explode in their steel cages up and down the Mile. Percy's baton drops from his nerveless fingers and clatters to the floor, never to be picked up again. And then Coffey steps back, rubbing his mouth as if he's tasted something bad. The color has returned to his skin. Percy, however, is ashen gray. His expression is blank as a sheet of paper, not a trace of awareness in his eyes. The men are stunned. Paul raises his hand to Percy's face, snaps his fingers. Nothing. He tries again, clapping loudly. Percy reacts slightly, eyes fluttering, swaying a bit.}
