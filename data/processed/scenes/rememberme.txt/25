<L>__{exterior private school. just after.}
<A>__{it's just after three, caroline emerges from school in a cluster of 6th grade girls. one of them dips her head towards caroline's ear, as if to share a secret. whatever she says makes caroline's face crumble, almost to tears, and the girls snicker. tyler hops from his perch on a parked car. his bike leans on a fire hydrant.}
<C>__{tyler}
<P>__{(to caroline)}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{he looks at the girls, sizing them up, and flicks his cigarette to the sidewalk, cool as hell. the girls have a group swoon. he takes caroline by the elbow...}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{excuse us, we're due in surgery.}
<A>__{he gets his bike and leads her down the block, towards fifth avenue.}

<A>__{he hands her the book of myths.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{this was my favorite book ever. michael had it and he hit me over the head with it until i read it. its about all these god and goddesses who spend all of their time being jealous and petty and otherwise acting like human beings. the illustrations are amazing.}

<A>__{caroline smirks.}
<C>__{tyler}
