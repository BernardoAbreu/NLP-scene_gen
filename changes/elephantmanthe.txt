<ACTION>__{steam shooting out of a huge old half-rusted calliope. The music is very loud and raucous. Moving up and back we see the black awning entrance to the freak tent, where FREDERICK TREVES, Resident Surgeon and Lecturer on anatomy at the London Hospital, is standing with his back to us observing the posters of the freaks. Coming along a muddy walkway at the side of the tent is Treves' wife, ANNE, and their two DAUGHTERS. The shrill over- whelming music seems to engulf her. She looks discomfited, vulnerable, and protective of her daughters. The girls, oblivious to any fear, are finishing their chocolate sweets. CLOSE-UP of Treves looking at a poster. He hears:}
<DIAL>__{#1 DAUGHTER Poppa!}
<ACTION>__{Treves turns and looks down to a chocolate-covered face. He smiles at the children and Anne. Anne sees the dirty faces and begins cleaning one of them. The other daughter looks into the freak tent.}

<CHAR>__{ANNE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Alright... Your turn.}
<ACTION>__{She turns the girl away from the freak tent and begins cleaning her face. Her kerchief pulls and distorts the little daughter's face. Suddenly the girl sees a ring of elephants in the distance.}

<DIAL>__{You won't be long?}
<CHAR>__{TREVES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'll join you shortly.}
<ACTION>__{She takes the children off toward the elephants. Treves watches them go for a moment, then turns and we go with him into the dark freak tent. He pauses to pay admission at a small booth, then disappears within. DARKNESS. We hear what could be the trumpeting of an elephant. Treves parts the black canvas and enters the main part of the tent. Off to his left he sees a man wrapped in a black cape, holding a conch shell aloft and blowing powerfully into it. The tent is dimly lit with flickering oil lamps. People mill about through the weaving corridors. To Treves' right, he sees a sign reading, "The Deadly Fruit of the Original Sin," over a small, very dark corridor. Treves enters the passage and disappears into the shadows. The corridor has a series of flaps and turns to disorient the spectator. Treves carefully pushes his way through and arrives at the inner chamber. In a roped-off space stands a small stage set at eve-level, with curtains on three sides. On the stage is a bell jar filled with grey-murky fluid lit from behind with casts an eerie glow in the chamber. Suspended in the fluid is the life-sized body of a baby-doll with the attached head of a large snake. At the join of head and body is a blob of unidentifiable organic matter. It is obviously phony, but the effect is still very disquieting. At the bottom of the jar, in the muck, sits an apple with two large bites out of it. Behind the jar is a painting on the order of a religious triptych, portraying Adam on one side, Eve on the other, and the tree flowering over the jar. Treves' impassive face is bathed in the watery glow. He studies the strange object with a critical eye. In the passage we hear movement, and an OLDER GENTLEMAN enters. He seems visibly impressed with "The Deadly Fruit of the Original Sin."}

<DIAL>__{A wicked birth...}
<ACTION>__{After a moment, Treves quietly leaves the inner chamber. As he pushes his way through the corridor, the noise grows and becomes a cacophony of strange sounds. He exits and hears a booming roar and the rush of air as a series of twelve candles, mounted in a row on a ten-foot stand, are blown out by "THE INCREDIBLE WIND-MAN." His BARKER steps up and talks to the people.}
<CHAR>__{BARKER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Ladies and Gentlemen, his lungs are larger than this mammoth blacksmith's bellows. So great is his power of exhalation, rivaling even that of the Great North Wind, that he will now challenge two grown men to attempt to hold the bellows shut as he applies the mighty blast of his herculean breath! Are there any volunteers?}
<ACTION>__{A few people raise their hands. The Barker scans the crowd and then points over the heads of the volunteers to TWO MEN toward the back.}
<CHAR>__{BARKER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Ah! I see two likely lads! Come forward! Come forward! Pit your strength against the Mighty Wind- Man!}
<ACTION>__{During the above, The Incredible Wind-Man removes his cape, revealing his great barrel chest and pot-belly supported by spindly, white, hairless legs. As the Barker sets the "Volunteers," the Wind-Man walks about the small platform, huffing and puffing and blowing on the conch shell. The "Volunteers" set, the Wind-Man steps up to the end of the bellows, takes an enormous breath, and twirls his black handlebar moustache as a signal to the Barker.}

<DIAL>__{Ladies and Gentlemen!... Let the demonstration begin!!}
<ACTION>__{The Wind-Man clamps his mouth to the bellows, and with great show begins to exhale, savagely stamping his feet. The Two Lads struggle obviously, and then pretend to be forced apart. The Barker triumphantly lifts the Wind-Man's hand. The Wind- Man ceases to blow, removes his lips from the bellows and the Two Lads instantly collapse together on the floor.}

<DIAL>__{Ladies and Gentlemen!... "THE INCREDIBLE WIND-MAN!!!}
<ACTION>__{The crowd cheers, while the Wind-Man puts the conch shell to his lips and proudly stamps his feet, circling about the Two Lads. Amidst this applause, Treves smiles indulgently. He moves on, looking for something genuine. TWO BOBBIES move through the crowd, intent upon a certain destination. Treves conveys a casual interest in them. Treves moves on to A BEARDED LADY who combs her beard, busily chewing tobacco and spitting into a spittoon. Treves continues to work his way through the crowd. Up ahead he sees the Bobbies.}

<ACTION>__{We hear the laughter of a crowd. Treves moves closer to see a FAT LADY seated in a chair on the next platform. On each knee she holds a DWARF. They are dressed as babies. A SKELETON MAN stands beside her.}

<DIAL>__{This is too much! They should not allow it! They should not allow it!}
<ACTION>__{Treves, very curious now, along with several others, make their way around the corner. Before him, Treves sees an agitated crowd staring at something that from his point of view he cannot see. Brushing past him is a WOMAN pulling a small, confused and frightened LITTLE GIRL. Getting closer to the commotion, he sees four BOBBIES standing with a well-dressed alderman, arguing with the OWNER of this particular exhibit. A distraught, almost hysterical WOMAN is ineffectually striking the Owner with her fists about his head and shoulders, crying weakly and incoherently.}
<CHAR>__{WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Beast, Beast...}
<ACTION>__{Treves is just about to see whatever it is that is causing the alarm, when one of the Bobbies says:}
<CHAR>__{BOBBY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No! That's right out! Drop the curtain!}
<ACTION>__{As the curtain drops, Treves just glimpses baggy trouser cuffs and two horribly deformed, root-like feet. The distraught Woman has been pulled away from the Owner and is sobbing on a Bobby's shoulder.}

<CHAR>__{ALDERMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I have the authority to close you down, and I'm doing just that!}
<ACTION>__{In the crowd, Treves notices a YOUNG BOY staring open-mouthed, blankly at the curtain. Treves pushes through the glut of people to join the Boy and get a better view. The curtain is actually a large canvas. On it is a life-sized portrait, crudely painted, of a creature that could only be possible in a nightmare. It is the figure of a man turning into an elephant. The transformation, however, is not complete; there is still more of the man than beast. Palm trees in the background suggest the jungle habitat in which this Perverted object might have once roamed. Filled with curiosity, Treves moves toward the curtain.}

<TRANS>__{FADE TO BLACK:}
<ACTION>__{OPERATING ROOM - THE LONDON HOSPITAL We see a bellows pumping air into the open grate of a cast iron stove. We hear moaning in the background. The coals flare to a fierce glow. From the mouth of the stove protrude the handles of several cauterizing irons, their heads imbedded in the coals. Up above the irons, Treves stands by a waist- high operating table covered with black leather. His face is illuminated by an oil lantern held by a nurse. The room is fairly dark owing to the oppressive overcast sky seen through two windows. There is also a large sink, a cupboard containing dressings, gags, manacles, emetics and other unattractive things, and two hard chairs. TWO STUDENTS and two other DOCTORS, MR. FOX and MR. HILL, are present. The two Students are pulling with constant pressure on a rope tied to the patient's leg. Treves and Mr. Fox are working on a chest wound caused by a machine accident. There are gear-wheel marks getting progressively deeper as they near a great open gash. Mr. Hill places a cotton mask over the patient's nose and mouth and applies drops of chloroform. The patient struggles, but soon his moans subside and he is unconscious.}

<ACTION>__{The two medical Students come forward. They stare uneasily at the gaping wound, which bubbles each time the man takes an agonized breath. Treves and Fox quickly and expertly tend the wound as Hodges and Pierce look on.}

<CHAR>__{TREVES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Of course you do realize that medicine has changed quite a bit since your father's time. In those days we didn't even wash our coats. In fact, the sign of a truly accomplished surgeon-- was his black operating coat, so stiff with dried blood and pus that it could stand up by itself in the corner. I've still got mine upstairs... You don't mind blood, do you? HODGES & PIERCE}

<ACTION>__{A hospital MESSENGER BOY, dressed in a blue uniform and a can is making his way down the hall. He stops and looks into an operating room much like the one we have just seen. Inside, the room is empty. The Boy closes the door and continues on to another operating room. The Doctors move with great urgency around the operating table. Blood is draining down into a white porcelain bowl. A Woman can be heard moaning. The Boy looks carefully, but finally closes the door and continues on his way. TREVES' OPERATING ROOM There is a hissing sound and steam from the cauterizing of the wound comes up obscuring part of Treves' face. The patient is being held down firmly by the other men. The door opens and Treves looks up. The Boy pops his head in.}

<ACTION>__{AERIAL SHOT from third floor of the London Hospital looking down on the hospital square. Below, Treves is walking briskly across the square, through a gate and into the slums beyond. The aerial shot is actually FOX'S POV, and now we see Fox filled with curiosity, watching the figure from a window. Looking down from above and to the side of him, we follow Treves walking through a cobblestone street still wet from a recent rain, covered with horse manure and filth of all sorts. The air is smoky from meat burning fires. Rounding a corner, we see and approach the painted canvas sign of "The Elephant Man" covering the front of a small, dingy shop. The door of the shop is windowless and padlocked. Treves walks into the picture, studies the whole scene for a moment, goes to the shop door and finds that it is padlocked. Treves tries to look under an edge of the canvas. To his left he sees a SMALL BOY watching him intently.}

<ACTION>__{A noisy pub, long and narrow. Benches run the length of the back wall, with small tables up against them. Men are clustered around the bar, talking in groups. We see the Boy standing at one of the tables talking to the Owner, greedily consuming his lunch as he listens. The Boy gestures outside.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{OUTSIDE THE PUB}

<ACTION>__{Total darkness. We hear the sound of the padlock being removed. The door opens and light streams in. The canvas covering the windows at the front of the shop obscures all other light. The Owner enters, followed by Treves and the Boy. From his expression, as well as Treves', we can tell there must be an awful stench in the room. No one says a word. The Boy closes the door, while the owner lights a small gas light. We can now see the shop. It it empty, grey with dust, cold and dank. Some old tins and a few shriveled potatoes occupy a shelf. The far end of the shop is blocked off by a curtain suspended from a cord by a few rings. The Owner approaches it.}

In front of it on a tripod is a large brick, heated from below by a bunsen burner. From the blanket protrudes a perfectly normal left arm and hand warming itself over the brick. It does not move when the curtain is drawn. Treves steps closer. The Owner, watching his every move, turns-and smiles at him. He bangs his riding crop on the wall and yells to the crouched figure, as if speaking to a dog.}

Treves, his eyes wide with horror and wonder, his mouth frozen open, steps backward in an instinctive movement of self preservation. The Owner laughs. The Elephant Man is naked to the waist, his feet are bare and he wears a pair of worn trousers from a fat man's dress suit. He is a little below average height, and looks shorter from the bowing of his back. His head is enormous and misshapen, as big around as a man's waist. From his brow projects a huge boney mass, almost obscuring his right eye. His nose is a nose of flesh, recognizable only from its position. From the upper jaw projects another mass of bone protruding from the mouth like a stump, turning the upper lip inside out, making a slobbering aperture. It almost gives the impression of a rudimentary trunk or tusk. On top of his head is a handful of lank, black hair. At the back of it hangs a bag of spongy skin, resembling cauliflower. These loathsome growths cover his back and hang down to the middle of his thighs. The right arm is enormous and shapeless, the hand like a knot of tuberous roots. His left arm is not only normal, but delicately shaped, with fine skin and a hand that any woman might envy. From his chest hangs another bag of flesh, like the dewlap of a lizard. His legs are also grossly deformed, his feet great stumps. Behind him, as painted in the portrait, are two crudely constructed palm trees. The Owner harshly raps again.}

On his head is an extremely large hat, cut to the lines of a yachting cap. A grey-flannel curtain hangs from the bottom of the cap all the way around, hiding his face. There is a horizontal slit in front for the eyes. On the figure's feet are large, bag-like slippers. The only part of the body seen at all is the left arm and hand, which protrudes from the cloak, holding a crude walking stick. The figure seems to loathe being in the open.

TREVES' OFFICE The door opens and Treves leads the hooded figure to a chair in front of his desk and helps him to sit down, furtively trying to look into the eye-slit of the mask. In the small room the smell of the Elephant Man is overwhelming. Treves goes to the window and opens it. He nervously tries to compose himself, then turns to the hooded figure.}

Indeed, this hospital's rules do preclude the admission of incurables, but if ever there was an exception to the rule, it is this patient.

He hangs up his disguise, then goes back to the window and pulls the curtains aside. Moonlight bathes the table, illuminating the portrait of his Mother.

Trailing behind him on a string is a small wooden ark on wheels. A lionfaced man is combing the hair that covers his face. A Rubber Man pulls the skin of his neck up over his face. There is a fairly big crowd standing around a Tall Man, affectionately rubbing the Small Parasitic Twin, growing out of his chest. The Barker-Owners compete with each other and the occasional thunder.

We pull back to see an Elderly Man in a heavy black overcoat with a wide-brimmed rain hat eating an apple. Beside him his wife knits. A few other people similarly clothed are sleeping.

A YOUNG BOY is seated on a pile of baggage looking very adult and bored. His MOTHER stands beside him, though we see only a portion of her billowy skirt. We hear her voice in rapid conversation with another Woman. The Young Boy scans the crowd looking for excitement. He sees something. The Elderly Man we saw on the train and his wife are moving past the barrier. The Young Boy slowly pulls a peashooter from a pocket, puts a pea in his mouth, and raises the pipe to his lips.

One of them darts toward him and grabs a hold of Merrick's hood. Merrick turns frantically away and as he does, the hood is pulled off him. The crowd shouts at him as he goes, following him in wary pursuit. He moves back past the children and Jim's Mother. They all scream and shield themselves from his approach. Another group of people move toward him blocking all escape. Behind him, he sees a door to a urinal. He moves through it followed by the crowd. We hear fearsome echoes inside. Inside the urinal, the crowd presses Merrick toward a wall. They have become angry now. They shout and there is fear in their voices. They hem Merrick in. He looks around hoping for an opening. There is none. He gives a strangled cry and collapses as the bobby pushes his way through the crowd. Merrick puts his good hand over his good ear trying to block out the screams of the crowd.}
