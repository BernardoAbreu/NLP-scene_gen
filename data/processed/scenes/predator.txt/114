<L>__{exterior encampment day (pre dawn)}
<A>__{a patchy ground fog covers the area. anna, in her foxhole, awakens, listening to the rising sounds of the jungle. monkeys begin to forage, their noisy chattering and screeching filling the air. a bird flutters back to its nest; a chameleon emerges onto a leaf, directly above anna's head. revised "hunter" 5 6 86 anna carefully extends her arm, allowing the lizard to crawl onto her, watching, fascinated as it changes colors. she carefully places the chameleon back on the leaf, which changes color again, becoming nearly invisible. near the empty poncho, schaefer, billy and ramirez are examining the ground and the trip wire to the flare. billy stands, turns to schaefer.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{boar set off the trip flare, major. no other tracks.}
<A>__{schaefer kneels and examines the thin, well hidden wire. he stands, looking around the camp.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{how could anyone get through this, carry blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{he knows our defenses.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{why didn't he try to kill one of us last night?}
<A>__{schaefer looks at him.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{he came back for the body.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{he's killing us, one at a time...}
<A>__{schaefer turns and looks at billy, asking with his eyes for a viable explanation.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{like a hunter.}
<A>__{schaefer stares at him, the words sinking in. he looks up, reconstructing in his mind the possible events of last night, his eyes following the tree line, tracing the path of the intruder as he might have travelled through the trees and down to the ground. he looks up at billy.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{he uses the trees.}
<A>__{revised "hunter" 5 6 86 billy and ramirez stare up at the trees, a wave of fear passing through them...from the trees. schaefer turns, moving to where dillon is guarding anna, sitting on the ground. reaching down, schaefer pulls her firmly to her feet, looking at her intensely.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{yesterday. what did you see?}
<A>__{she stares back at him.}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{you're wastin' your time.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{no more games.}
<A>__{she looks at him a long moment, and then answers in english.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i don't know what it was. it...}
<A>__{dillon does a double take. schaefer continues to look at anna. he wasn't surprised: he knew it yesterday.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{go on.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it changes colors, like the chameleon. it uses the jungle...}
<C>__{dillon}
<P>__{(derisively)}
<D>__{shit, you trying to tell me blain and hawkins were killed by a fucking lizard? don't listen to her. its's a psych job. two, maybe three of them, that's all. we keep our cool, out think them 'til we're across the border...}
<A>__{ignoring him, schaefer takes her hands, drawing his commando knife, looking squarely into her eyes.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{what's you name?}
<A>__{she looks back into his eyes. revised "hunter" 5 6 86}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{anna.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{anna. he's hunting us. you know that?}
<A>__{she nods. with a sudden movement he slices through her bonds.}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{what the hell do you think you're doing?}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{we're going to need everyone.}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{what are you talking about? we'll be out of here in ten minutes.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{we're not going.}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{that rendezvous is ten maybe twelve miles, at most! we're almost home. but the chopper won't wait.}
<A>__{schaefer turns to face him.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{dillon...this thing doesn't care who we are, who she is. we make a stand or there won't be anyone left to make that chopper.}
<A>__{dillon stares back, not wanting to hear what he already knows to be true. anna touches schaefer's arm.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{there is something else. when the big man was killed, you must have wounded it.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{it's blood was on the leaves.}
<A>__{revised "hunter" 5 6 86 she touches her pant leg, the stain is faded but still there. schaefer turns to dillon.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{if it bleeds, we can kill it.}
