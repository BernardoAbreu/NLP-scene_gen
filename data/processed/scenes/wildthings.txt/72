<L>__{exterior interior ken's t bird day}
<A>__{top down, speeds on a highway, banana palms on one side, the blue atlantic on the other. wind buffets ken and sam who has a dazed look.}
<C>__{ken}
<P>__{(hyped)}
<D>__{come on, let loose!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i was just thinking about where i'm gonna stay. i lost the house. it's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.}
<C>__{ken}
<D>__{you'll get over it. we've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against sandra van ryan.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{just like that?}
<C>__{ken}
<D>__{just like that? these people ruined your life, bro.}
<A>__{ken pauses to thump the wheel with the butt of his hand.}
<C>__{ken }
<D>__{i told you they were going overboard and they did... they'll settle. believe me. they'll be begging to settle...}
<A>__{at which point ken spots something up ahead. his smile broadens. he swerves into the other lane, tooting his horn, waving, as... the t bird draws even with a sleek black limo.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you don't think you're overdoing it?}
<A>__{he pulls off his neck brace, dangles it in front of sam's face, then tosses it out the window.}
