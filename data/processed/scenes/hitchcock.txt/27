<L>__{exterior paramount studios day}
<A>__{the famous gates and the executive building beyond it.}
<P>__{lew wasserman (pre lap)}
<D>__{barney, we're about to propose a restructured deal for "psycho"...}
<L>__{interior balaban's private office, paramount day}
<A>__{balaban watches hitchcock and lew closely. hitchcock again is like a waxworks buddha, revealing nothing.}
<C>__{lew wasserman}
<D>__{we finance it. independently. paramount only distributes it...in exchange for 40 percent of the profits.}
<C>__{barney balaban}
<D>__{interesting. but tell us, what exactly is paramount distributing? is this still a picture about a queer killing people in his mother's dress?}
<C>__{lew wasserman}
<D>__{what this picture is about is the reputation of alfred hitchcock.}
<C>__{barney balaban}
<D>__{no one's arguing that.}
<C>__{lew wasserman}
<D>__{barney, it's very simple. this is mr. hitchcock's next film. are you in or are you out?}
<A>__{a long silence.}
<C>__{barney balaban}
<D>__{well, obviously you have a lot of passion for this project. let me talk it over with a few people internally and i will get back to you.}
<C>__{lew wasserman}
<D>__{no. now.}
<A>__{balaban takes in their inscrutable stares. not unimpressed by their chutzpah, he leans back and puts his hands behind his head, a king in his counting room.}
<C>__{barney balaban}
<D>__{fine. we'll take that deal. if you can get the money...}
<A>__{finally, hitchcock speaks up :}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{we've already got it, barney.}
<A>__{he pulls out his personal checkbook and opens it on the desk. barney watches as hitch takes the onyx fountain pen from its mount.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock }
<D>__{who do i make it out to?}
