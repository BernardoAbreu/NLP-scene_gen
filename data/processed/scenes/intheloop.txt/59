<L>__{interior liza's apartment day}
<A>__{toby wakes up. his mouth is parched. he feels terrible. he rolls over. liza is gone. he can't remember where he is or what's going on. then with a flash as he looks at the clock 9.07 he remembers a lot of things in a rush and springs out like a ninja and starts pulling his clothes on, while scrabbling for his phone. he heads down stairs & out of the apartment.}
