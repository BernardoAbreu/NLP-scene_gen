<L>__{exterior lagoon day}
<A>__{waves break against the reef. with his paddles chuck maneuvers the raft toward the cut in the reef. boom! the wave crashes, the water surges through the cut, then recedes with a whoosh. chuck watches, times the waves, paddles like mad. he's committed. scrape goes the first barrel, then the second, riding the receding wave. he's out! but the next wave is already surging forward. it smashes the raft against the reef! coconuts and foodstuffs hurtle off the raft! the barrels cushion the impact. the raft tilts, spins, but stays outside the reef! the ropes holding the jugs of water break! the water sweeps overboard! the wave recedes again. chuck recovers, paddles with all his strength, and then he's clear of the breakers! for a long moment he floats on the rollers, getting his breath. the water jugs float away, carried by the waves back into the lagoon. chuck could go back and get them. if he were being prudent, he definitely would. but he's out. he might never get back out again. he stares at the lagoon and the receding water jugs. then he stares at the island. goodbye to all that.}
