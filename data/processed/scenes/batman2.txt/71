<L>__{interior penthouse apartment night}
<A>__{at this height, the sirens are a distant insect drone. we're in the palatial digs of randall shaw, the construction magnate. there's obviously money to be made in real estate development because the walls are lined with art, and the floor to ceiling windows open on the most spectacular view in gotham. at the moment, shaw's posing casually in front of his new brancusi which rests on a pedestal near the windows. an unidentified woman in a slinky black dress looks on, her back to the camera...}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{it's a fake.}
<C>__{shaw}
<D>__{hmm. it cost me a half a million dollars. you're sure?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{absolutely. you see, i...happen to know where the real one is stashed.}
<A>__{the woman wanders out of frame as shaw smiles, impressed. he seems peculiarly nonchalant about the whole deal; at the moment, art is not the first thing on his mind. camera stays on him as he pours two glasses of red wine and circles in on his mysterious guest.}
<C>__{shaw}
<D>__{i guess you'd know. i have some "friends" in the art world. they say that for certain hard to get items you're the one to call.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{how flattering.}
<C>__{shaw}
<D>__{they say for the right price...you could steal michelangelo off the sistine chapel wall.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{mr. shaw. do you believe everything you hear?}
<C>__{shaw}
<D>__{oh, i'm not one to judge. i admire people who take what they want. i'm just curious how you do it.}
<A>__{shaw hands her the wine, and for the first time we see her face. it's selina kyle, perching seductively on the arm of the sofa...}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{i find that the old methods work best.}
<A>__{setting her wine down, flashing her patented cheshire cat smile, selina moves in on him and they go into a deep, passionate kiss. her long red nails dig into his back; shaw drops his wine glass, which shatters splashing red wine across the polished parquet floor.}
