<L>__{exterior beach dusk}
<A>__{brody is on restless patrol, checking the water's edge as he continues on home. as he drives along, he sees: a clambake; some teen agers in a group, necking and dancing; and a few solitary surfcasters and fishermen. the beach is deserted, the sun is setting, and brody and his jeep have the sand to themselves. it's then that he sees something: brody's point of view a big bow section of a ruined, burnt boat is bobbing in the surf just off the beach ahead. it's a piece of the waterskiers' boat; brody heads towards it.}
<B>__{angle on the surf}
<A>__{as brody slows his jeep just short of the water, and gets out to look at the flotsam. his shoes get wet. he backs up onto dry sand, then tries to edge closer to examine this object. it bobs up and down in the surf; brody makes "get in here" motions. the junk resists.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{come on, give a guy a break.}
<A>__{no response. he takes off his shoes and socks, and rolls up his trouser legs. a silly sight. he wades into the water after it.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{come on. here boy. come to poppa...}
<A>__{it eludes him, and he flounders after it. a big wave breaks across his crotch.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{hoo! cold!}
<A>__{he's almost there, it's just beyond his reach, he's got it, he's lost it, he has it again, it's slippery...}
<C>__{brody}
<P>__{(ad lib)}
<D>__{come here. come on, sweetheart. you bastard. a little closer... here y'go...}
<A>__{then, he's got it }
<C>__{brody}
<P>__{(exultant)}
<D>__{gotcha!}
<B>__{close on brody in the water}
<A>__{as he grabs the ruined wood, and pulls it towards him. suddenly, the mass of wreckage breaks apart, and something lunges out of the mess and into brody.}
