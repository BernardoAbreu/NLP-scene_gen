<A>__{chris, approaching the annandale house. his backpack on and body healthy. billie parts the curtains, ecstatic to see chris approach, alive and healthy. we see but do not hear her call to walt. a smiling chris steps up the curb, approaching home. walt and billie we push into them as they gleefully run out the front door to their returning son. push into chris he dispatches his backpack to the ground and runs toward his parents' embrace.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{what if you saw me running into your arms...}
<A>__{chris, walt, and billie on the cusp of a jubilant and loving embrace!}
<D>__{chris (v.o.) (cont'd) would you see then...}
<A>__{the drumming resumes with a blast of bass and before an embrace is possible...}
<D>__{chris (v.o.) (cont'd) ...what i see now?}
<T>__{a sudden cut to:}
<L>__{interior bus}
<B>__{total silence}
<A>__{chris looking at the sky, a cathartic tear falls from his left eye. another from his right as the obscuring cloud clears the sun. chris: the last, airy expulsion of his breath. his open face as the clearing light of the sun shines in his eyes. it is a face of peace, love, a face of true, deep serenity. the eyes joyously open and the corners of his mouth ease into the subtle smile of euphoric wisdom. that's the way he settles to stillness, looking directly into our camera.}
<D>__{and he died alive.}
<A>__{he made it. he lived. he loved. cat stevens' miles from nowhere plays over: as we pull away from chris' face through the bus window and up into the sky we drift further and further away, above the stunted trees and the shimmering roof of the bus like a tiny white gleam in a wild green sea grows smaller and smaller. reprise image of truck driver taking picture of chris in scene #1. then it's him: the smiling still image we saw taken in the first scene from behind, but now we are seeing it from the front and it is the image of the real christopher mccandless on the edge of the stampede trail. as it takes over the screen, we zoom slowly into his smiling face. and then, these words appear superimposed over it: dedicated to the memory of christopher johnson mccandless february 12, 1968 august 18th, 1992 as those words dissolve, these words appear: on september 19, 1992, carine mccandless flew with her brother's ashes from alaska home to the eastern seaboard. she carried them with her on the plane...in her backpack.}
