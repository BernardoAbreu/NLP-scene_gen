<T>__{cut to jacob:}
<A>__{'s face. he has gone beyond fear. an intensity of rage is building in him that we have not witnessed before. his whole image seems transformed by it. he glows like a volcano before it erupts. suddenly he explodes. the full fury of the ladder detonates inside him. he yells at the demon with all his might.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no!!!!!}
<A>__{with a power and energy of devastating force he attacks the demon. jacob is battling for his very soul and tears at the demon with an animalistic fury that takes it by surprise. its giant wings flap furiously, lifting them both up off the floor. jacob keeps fighting. he claws, bites, and rips at the wings, decimating their delicate fabric. the demon, shocked, and trying to gain control, crashes up through the last fragments of the ceiling. jacob does not let go. they burst into the fiery darkness. the room crumbles beneath them and disappears into the void. the abyss opens beneath them. jacob continues his attack. his legs are locked around the demon's waist. his hands dig into her eyes. the demon shrieks and surges downward with awesome velocity. the demon charges into a rocky slope, smashing jacob into its cliffs. jacob claws at her wings, shredding as much of them as he can reach. the demon takes a huge chunk out of jacob's arm. jacob screams, grabs a rock, and shatters the demon's teeth. the demon falls to the ground. jacob holds on. all of a sudden the demon begins to shrink. jacob is shocked and struggles to contain it. as it dwindles in size it reorders its shape. within seconds a powerful insect is cupped in his hands. jacob tries to crush it but it stings with such force that jacob's entire body recoils. the stinging persists. jacob hurls himself to the ground on top of his arms to hold the creature down. so massive is the insect's attack. however, that jacob's whole body heaves off the ground with each sting. then the attacks subside. jacob waits for the next blow. suddenly jacob's body shoots straight up. his hands fly apart as a new life form erupts between them. he holds on tightly as flesh and blood mold and expand between his fingers. the new body takes rapid shape. it is a child. jacob grasps it with all his might as it completes its identity. he is horrified when he sees it. it is his son.}

<D>__{oh god!}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{you're hurting me!}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{stop!!!!}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{daddy. let go.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what do you want from me?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{let go!}
<A>__{jacob does not let up. in an instant his son explodes into a gelatinous form, constantly undulating and changing shape. within its translucent mass a new body is forming. jacob stares at it with growing terror. it is himself. a terrible perplexity fills jacob's eyes as he struggles to dig in and destroy his own image. he recoils as his own voice calls out to him.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{who the hell do you think you're fighting?}
<A>__{the words shock him and for the first time, he lets go. instantly the image disappears and the jelly like mass dissolves into an oily liquid rapidly encircling his feet. jacob looks down at the shallow pool spreading out beneath him. its surface reflects a smoky, unearthly light. jacob gazes into the darkness. he is all alone. the quiet overwhelms him. the only sound is his own breath. he looks around, in all directions, but can see nothing. the camera holds on him as he stands waiting for the next assault, but nothing comes. he is left only with his anticipation and with hinself. he stares at the terrible darkness. a subtle phospheresence begins to glow in the liquid beneath jacob's feet. he steps away from it, but it follows his movement. suddenly, as if by spontaneous combustion, it bursts into flames. jacob screams and tries to run but the flames move with him, lapping at his legs. he cannot escape them. as far and as fast as he runs the fire is with him. he yells and cries and screams as the fire eats at his lower limbs. he falls and jumps back up again, his hands charred. his eyes grow wild.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{oh god, help me.}
<A>__{instantly the flames roar and engulf him. it is total conflagration. jacob's skin blisters and turns black. his flesh crackles. writhing in pain he runs through the flames but can find no freedom from his suffering. all at once jacob stops running. he throws his hands up into the burning air and stands motionless, in absolute agony. it is a gesture of total submission and surrender to forces beyond himself. his flesh bubbles and chars but something is suddenly quiet inside him. through the flames jacob's dark form can be seen as it slowly sits down, like a buddhist monk, in the midst of the holocaust. he appears a figure of sudden nobility as the flames annihilate him. gradually the fire dies. jacob's body, his flesh like a charred and brittle shell, sits motionless, beyond pain. an orange glow from the embers of his body slowly fades, leaving him in the final darkness. the screen stays dark for as long as possible. then, slowly, an eerie light appears in an unfamiliar sky. it backlights jacob, revealing his silhouette. the camera dollies slowly toward him. it approaches the burned and unrecognizable remains of jacob's face. it is the face of death. the camera holds on the image. suddenly, with shocking impact, jacob's eyes move. within the crumbling shell of a body something is still alive, still conscious. the eyes survey the darkness and the first stirrings of a new light. it is dawn. jacob's dark remains are suffused by a preternatural glow. slowly, huge orbs begin to appear on the horizon. jacob's eyes open to the growing light as they seek out the familiar in the still dark lansdcape. gradually the orbs begin their ascent like a thousand suns rising at the same time. jacob's eyes widen as his new world stands revealed. he is sitting in a garden of light, the rousseau paradise he has visited once before. a sudden burst of light fills the sky directly overhead. the vegetation around him is instantly illuminated with its soft glow. like a gentle breeze michael descends from the light and stands radiant before jacob. he smiles and the air itself seems to brighten. michael quietly approaches jacob's body.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i am with you, jacob.}
<A>__{jacob stares at him through dark eyes with a mixture of awe and disbelief.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(speaking with a gentle compassion)}
<D>__{it's all right now. it's over. you've won. you're here.}
<P>__{(jacob stares at him}
<D>__{questioningly. michael}
<P>__{reaches out his hands)}
<D>__{trust me.}
<A>__{softly michael places his hands on top of jacob's head and begins to peel at the charred flesh. layer by layer he strips it away. then, with an unexpected gesture, he rips away a whole section with one quick pull. a blaze of light bursts through the gaping hole in jacob's head and beams into the air around them. it is an astounding sight.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{come on. don't make me do it all.}
<P>__{(his eyes sparkle)}
<D>__{stand up.}
<P>__{(jacob's eyes are burst ing with wonder)}
<D>__{you can do it.}
<A>__{slowly jacob begins to stir. he moves feebly at first, like an old man. his black flesh creaks and cracks and through each sudden fissure another beam of light blasts out with laserlike intensity.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{stop hobbling. your flesh can't hold you anymore.}
<A>__{jacob nods in response and takes a huge, gigantic breath. his lungs expand and suddenly all the old flesh bursts from his body as a radiant being of light breaks through beneath it. jacob stands transfigured, filled with his own luminosity. his face is like a child's as he stares in amazement at his own hands, glowing with light. michael directs jacob's vision to the sunrise. it is majestic, almost biblical in its grandeur. great rays of light penetrate vast cloud formations and descend into the garden. slowly the clouds, as if orchestrated by some higher power, begin to part. a massive light complex emerges from behind them. jacob watches, awestruck, as the celestial stairway stands revealed. it reaches down from unknown heights, radiating an infinite power and grace. it touches down far in the distance, hovering over many acres of teh garden. jacob's eyes are filled with its splendor. michael looks at him and nods.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{go on, jacob. it has come for you.}
<A>__{jacob cannot speak. his eyes are fixed on the stairway dazzling him from afar. he can see angelic forms moving up and down it. suddenly, as if transported by light itself, he feels himself floating up into the air. he looks down upon eden sparkling below him. his mouth is wide open as he soars above it. the light pulsating from the stairway is brilliant and thrilling. jacob's own inner light intensifies as he approaches it. the stairway grows increasingly wondrous as we draw nearer. it pulls jacob toward it. streams of angels enter the stairway like a fast flowing river. it carries them instantly within its current up beyond the visible reaches of the glittering sky. billowing clouds glow in a parade of colors and the starry heavens seem to part as the stairway reaches beyond all known dimensions. jacob stares at the light that is about to absorb him. it is a moment of total euphoria. he surges into the stream as the brilliant light of the stairway overwhelms the screen. slowly the brightness of the screen condenses into a smaller light source. an overhead surgical lamp remains stubbornly in view.}
