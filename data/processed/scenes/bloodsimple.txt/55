<L>__{exterior facing roof}
<A>__{we are looking through the telescopic sight of a high powered rifle. the rifle sweeps up from ray's body across the brightly lit room, and centers abby, still staring at the window, in the cross hairs.}
<L>__{interior abby's apartment}
<A>__{we are looking past abby toward the shattered window at the far end of the room. a brass lamp stands in the foreground, between abby and the camera. abby still stands paralyzed. glass has stopped chinking from the window to the floor; there is a painful silence. suddenly abby dives to the floor just as crash the rest of the window falls away and ping the brass lamp somersaults toward us from the impact of the bullet. the window is now completely gone just a black hole in the brightly lit wall.}
<B>__{abby}
<A>__{scrambles into a corner at the window end of the room. the only sound is her heavy breathing. she looks over at ray, then up at the bulb on the ceiling. abby's pov ceiling bulb}
<B>__{back to abby}
<A>__{breathing heavily, almost hysterical. she looks down at the floor. abby's pov ray is sprawled on the floor in a pool of blood and broken glass.}
<B>__{back to abby}
<A>__{she reaches down and pulls off one of her shoes. she throws it at the ceiling bulb. we hear the bulb shatter and the room goes black. abby rises and makes her way cautiously across the glass littered floor toward ray. she stoops over him.}
<B>__{low shot the dark apartment}
<A>__{its front door in background. abby rises into frame and backs toward the doorway, staring down at the floor. one of her hands is covered with blood.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{ray }
<A>__{she winces and almost loses her balance as we hear a piece of glass crunching under her bare floor. she turns and moves to the front door, favoring one foot, and throws the door open.}
<B>__{hallway}
<A>__{abby lurches from her apartment and pounds on the neighboring door. no answer. she pounds on the door across the hall.}
<C>__{old woman's voice}
<P>__{(frightened, in spanish)}
<D>__{get away! i will call my son in law!}
<C>__{abby}
<P>__{(groping for the words, in spanish)}
<D>__{no no you don't understand }
<C>__{old woman's voice}
<P>__{(in spanish)}
<D>__{he has a gun!}
<A>__{abby heads for the stairway at the far end of the hall. the heel of her shod foot is throwing her weight onto her bad foot; she kicks off the shoe.}
<B>__{close shot abby}
<A>__{as she reaches the top of the stairs. she takes one step down, then brings herself up short. she looks over the railing down the stairwell. it is quiet. an innocent sounding cough echoes somewhere in the building. we hear the sound of footsteps from somewhere below. abby turns and hobbles back to her apartment. the bareness of the hallway sets off her abandoned shoe. abby's apartment as she enters and slams the door behind her. she scrabbles at the lock, finally manages to get it shut, then turns and looks frantically around. abby's pov ray is lying still in the darkness. we can hear footsteps approaching up the hallway. abby enters frame and kneels down next to ray. she fumbles around him briefly in the darkness. the doorknob rattles. abby freezes, listening, trying to control her breath. after a moment we hear a scraping at the lock. abby moves to the bathroom adjoining the main room and shuts the door behind her.}
<B>__{bathroom}
<A>__{it is very small. abby presses her palms against the door and slowly eases her ear against the door to listen. the scraping in the apartment door lock continues. sweat streams down abby's face. she brushes a drop from her eye. we hear the snap of the lock springing open, and the front door swinging on its hinges.}
<B>__{closer on abby}
<A>__{her ear pressed to the door. from the next room we hear the sound of footsteps crunching across broken glass. abby backs away from the door, stares at it, then turns and moves to the bathroom window. she looks out. abby's pov a sheer drop to the narrow backyard of the building four stories below. next to abby's window is another window, separated from hers only by the breadth of the wall, that separates the two apartments. abby's apartment visser hunches, hands on knees, over ray, who lies on the floor out of frame.}
<C>__{visser}
<P>__{(grimly)}
<D>__{all right...}
<A>__{he hunkers down closer to ray.}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{...you got some of my personal property.}
<A>__{he is rummaging through ray's pockets but comes up empty handed.}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{...one of you does.}
<A>__{visser looks down at ray, glances around the room, looks back down at ray.}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{...i don't know what the hell you two thought you were gonna pull.}
<A>__{his hand, gripping something, flashes down out of frame. we hear a dull crunch.}
<B>__{bathroom}
<A>__{abby has drawn her head back from the bathroom window. she moves back to the door and braces herself against it. abby's apartment visser straightens up from ray's body. he drops something to the floor, out of frame, that lands with a thud. he goes over to the light switch on the wall and flips it back and forth. no light. he goes over to the brass lamp, sets it upright, tries its switch. again nothing. he disappears into the kitchenette as we hold on its open doorway. after a moment we hear a refrigerator hum as a cold blue light plays in the doorway. there is the rattle of a can being pulled off the refrigerator rack, and the snap of its pull tab being opened. after a couple of audible slurps we hear the can go back on the rack and, as the blue light disappears, we hear the refrigerator door close. visser reappears in the doorway. he surveys the room, fixes on the bathroom door, goes over, turns the knob. the door swings open. he walks in.}
<B>__{bathroom}
<A>__{visser looks around the cramped space. the shower curtain is drawn. he casually draws it back. the shower is empty. he goes to the window and leans out. visser's pov the sheer drop below; the other window to one side.}
<B>__{back to visser}
<A>__{he draws his head back in, presses his palms against the adjacent wall, and eases his ear to the wall to listen. perfect quiet. after a moment he goes back to the window, braces himself against the sash, and sticks his arm out groping for the window of the adjacent apartment.}
