<A>__{a deep shadow on the other side of an elm offers a likely hiding place. he moves through the underbrush toward it. without warning, his feet begin to slip out from under him. he struggles to regain his balance. when he does he looks down to find himself staring at a raging river 150 feet below. the bank on the other side is just a few feet above the water and in the moonlight he can see a flat plain cut by a highway that stretches into the distance. slowly, he backs away from the edge of the cliff. from under the elm he watches the helicopter sweep out over the ravine. its searchlight darts toward him bleaching the treeline. the overhanging branches cloak him and jenny and the light passes without picking them up. the star man adjusts his grip on jenny and starts off in the opposite direction from the helicopter to look for a way down the cliff.}
