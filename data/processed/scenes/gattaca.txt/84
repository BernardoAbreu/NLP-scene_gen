<L>__{interior jerome's condo living room. night.}
<A>__{jerome fastidiously vacuums with an upright cleaner. using a hose attachment he cleans around a picture frame that contains jerome's original computer keyboard handdrawn on the flap of a cardboard box.}
<L>__{interior gattaca computer complex. day.}
<A>__{in the vast room of computer programmers we pull focus to discover that we have been filming the complex through the transparent specimen bag containing jerome's eyelash. on the mezzanine floor overlooking the scene of the crime, the investigator holds the bag, transfixed by the lash. the lead homicide detective, detective hugo, finishes interviewing a gattaca security guard and approaches the investigator. a large telescope in the background. although hugo is deferential to his more youthful superior, his body language betrays his displeasure. hugo clearly does not relish the investigator's involvement in his case.}
<C>__{detective hugo}
<D>__{i don't understand why you were dragged out here, sir. it's hardly worth wasting your time a no nothing case like this.}
<C>__{investigator}
<P>__{(gently rebuking his subordinate)}
<D>__{a man's dead, detective.}
<C>__{detective hugo}
<D>__{of course, sir. we're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...}
<C>__{investigator}
<D>__{grudges?}
<C>__{detective hugo}
<P>__{(looking out over the balcony)}
<D>__{i look around, i see a lot of dry eyes. the director was not...}
<P>__{(searching for the words)}
<D>__{...universally loved. he was leading the cut backs in the program. you're looking at a room full of motives.}
<C>__{investigator}
<P>__{(shaking his head adamantly, referring to the bag in his hand)}
<D>__{no,}
<A>__{this is your man.}
<C>__{detective hugo}
<P>__{(not so convinced)}
<D>__{with respect, sir it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests }
<C>__{investigator}
<D>__{ what}
<A>__{about his profile? hugo refers to a print out of 20 year old vincent's profile including his genetic quotient. (the fifteen year old photo of vincent now bears little resemblance to his assumed identity.)}
<C>__{detective hugo}
<D>__{according to this, he's a sick man. congenital heart condition. who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes.}
<C>__{investigator}
<P>__{(terse)}
<D>__{so there's a 20 percent chance he's}
<A>__{not dead. detective hugo goes to comment further, then revises his remark in his head before speaking.}
<C>__{detective hugo}
<D>__{even if this vincent luca}
<A>__{is alive, is it}
<D>__{likely he could bludgeon a man to death?}
<C>__{investigator}
<D>__{no. not}
<A>__{likely}
<B>__{.}
<A>__{the investigator's tone suggests that the identity of the culprit is no longer a matter for debate. there is an awkward pause before the detective falls into step with his superior.}
<C>__{detective hugo}
<D>__{i take it you're thinking along the lines of a robbery gone sour a thief disturbed in the act?}
<A>__{the investigator merely shrugs.}
<C>__{detective hugo}
<P>__{(skeptical)}
<D>__{of course that doesn't jibe with what we found. this was an angry killing.}
<C>__{investigator}
<P>__{(glancing to the profile in hugo's hand)}
<D>__{who knows with these "deficients"? his profile indicates a proclivity for violence.}
<C>__{detective hugo}
<P>__{(trying to appear co operative)}
<D>__{i will run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections }
<C>__{investigator}
<D>__{ i've already run it. there's no record of any living relative.}
<C>__{detective hugo}
<D>__{what a pity.}
<C>__{investigator}
<P>__{(irritated, glancing to the sample bag)}
<D>__{detective hugo, it's a simple case of lost and found. all we have to do is locate the man who's minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself.}
<A>__{we focus on jerome at his work station. although he continues to work, he clrarly feels the presence of the investigators on the mezzanine floor behind him. a medical director approaches the programmer in the neighboring work station napoleon, the programmer jerome encountered in the nightclub the previous evening.}
<C>__{medical director}
<D>__{napoleon, you're late for your substance test.}
<A>__{napoleon looks up, ashen faced. jerome intervenes.}
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{director, napoleon's helping me today.}
<A>__{the director regards both men suspiciously.}
<C>__{medical director}
<D>__{well, you take it}
<A>__{for him, jerome. the medical director departs. napoleon, stunned by the reprieve, approaches jerome's work station and pretends to study the program on his computer screen.}
<C>__{napoleon}
<D>__{why did you do that?}
<C>__{jerome}
<P>__{(exiting to the testing lab)}
<D>__{don't worry about it.}
