<A>__{frank sits alone with a blanket over his shoulders. most of the blood has been wiped from his wound and he has a rough bandage on his head. from down the hallway a cheery stubble faced police officer, domenico (30's, animated), walks into the room where frank is waiting. domenico laughs, talking on his cell phone as he enters.}

<P>__{(suddenly noticing him)}
<D>__{hey, what are you doing in here?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{the officers told me to wait here. i've been sitting here for over two hours...}
<A>__{dominico glances over his shoulder.}
<C>__{domenico}
<D>__{i think they forgot about you.}
<A>__{frank sits back down heavily. domenico sits on the edge of a desk.}
<C>__{domenico }
<D>__{what happened to you, anyway?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{somebody tried to kill me.}
<A>__{domenico picks up frank's statement and glances at it.}
<C>__{domenico}
<D>__{mr. taylor, wow, you had quite a day. eh? we got chasing, we got shooting.}
<A>__{domenico looks at mild mannered frank sitting there in his boxers. the story seems unlikely.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you think i'm crazy but it's all true.}
<C>__{domenico}
<D>__{maybe you crazy and it's true, my friend.}
<A>__{domenico looks at frank a little harder. decides this guy is not making all this up.}
<C>__{domenico }
<D>__{okay, so who are these guys? why they mad at you?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i have absolutely no idea.}
<C>__{domenico}
<D>__{they followed you from the danieli?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{they came to the room. they pretended to be room service.}
<C>__{domenico}
<D>__{you don't scopata one of their girlfriends or something?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i didn't "scopata" anybody!}
<C>__{domenico}
<D>__{who is...}
<A>__{he consults a piece of paper.}
<C>__{domenico }
<D>__{cara mason?}
<A>__{frank is quiet. domenico playfully points at him.}
<C>__{domenico }
<D>__{i catch you, right?}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{in america the cops catch the crooks, not the victim.}
<C>__{domenico}
<D>__{ha ha, we do that sometimes here, too.}
<A>__{domenico considers for a moment.}
<C>__{domenico }
<D>__{is no domestic, then?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{domenico}
<D>__{how long you know cara mason?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i met her yesterday.}
<C>__{domenico}
<D>__{and you take her to the danieli? that must have been good meeting, yes?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i didn't take her. she took me.}
<A>__{the infectious grin again lights up domenico's face.}
<C>__{domenico}
<D>__{you lead an exciting life, mr. taylor.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{not usually.}
<A>__{domenico picks up the phone and dials a number. he talks in brisk italian, listens again and replaces the receiver.}
<C>__{domenico}
<D>__{signora mason was staying with "her husband" last night. you marry her, mr. taylor?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{domenico}
<D>__{i think maybe signora mason might know why these guys behave badly. what do you think?}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i think that's possible.}
<C>__{domenico}
<D>__{you got a phone number, mobile?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{she didn't give me one.}
<A>__{domenico looks him over.}
<C>__{domenico}
<D>__{you need some clothes. i will be right back.}
