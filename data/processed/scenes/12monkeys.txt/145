<A>__{surrounded by stripped and abandoned vehicles, the van, with a pest control logo on its side, is parked on a trash littered street beside the massive pillars of a towering freeway.}
<L>__{interior parked pest control van}
<A>__{the van is packed with six activists, sandy and kweskin among them, all wearing black. some of them have climbing gear, tool belts, all sorts of paraphernalia. kweskin is telling his story.}
<C>__{kweskin}
<D>__{so then he goes into this incredible riff about how his shrink, like, replicated his brain while he was in the nut house. turned it into a computer.}
<C>__{weller}
<D>__{and fale believed it?}
<C>__{kweskin}
<D>__{oh, you know fale! he's like, "if you guys get nailed and i'm sure you will i never saw you before in nay life!"}
<A>__{laughter from all of them. then, there's a sharp, rhythmic series of raps on the side door, a signal. pope quickly slides the door open. it's jeffrey...grinning. three other activists, goines, ichioka, and bruhns, stagger out of the darkness behind jeffrey, lugging a huge, squirming garbage bag. the van occupants react with murmurs of "awwwwwright" and "far out", then they help maneuver the writhing bag into the van. then, jeffrey and the other three scramble in, too.}
