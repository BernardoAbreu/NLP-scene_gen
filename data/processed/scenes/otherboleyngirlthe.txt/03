<D>__{exterior english countryside day the thunder of horses' hooves. a huge cloud of dust. the royal standard flutters in the wind. beneath it, a soldier in the king's uniform, riding hard, dirt kicking up in his wake. the soldier is flanked by a dozen other of the king's soldiers, who lead a coloumn of fifty or more riders.. it's like an army. a legion riding into battle. but it's not, this is just the king of england going away for the week end. behind the advance party, is the king himself, (30's), handsome, in his prime, surrounded by a dozen or so of his closest courtiers, (among them the duke of norfolk), a grand, tough, intimidating lot. behind them, comes the king's confessor, a priest with a large ornate crucifix, a small library of religious books.. then, in a riot of colour, come the musicians, the fool and the players, led by the master of the revels. behind them, come the squires and pages, carrying the king's weapons, his jousting kit, his swords, his armour, his lance, etc. then come the animals: falcons, in cages, and the hunting hounds, beagles and pinchers, barking in excitement, and an assortment of fresh horses for travelling, and hunting. and finally, bringing up the rear, another unit of armed guards, and a second standard bearer.. exterior hever day the boleyn family page, (william stafford), is perched on a hill. keeping watch. staring into the distance.. presently, he sees clouds of dust and the sound of thunder approaching. his expression changes... exterior hever estate day pandemonium breaks out among staff and family members as stafford calls out, "the king!" interior hever day anne is being dressed by maids. hearing the commotion outside, she rushes over to the window to see the approaching riders. anne looks out of the window. scans the approaching riders until she finds the king..}

<C>__{mary}
<D>__{of course, sister. how could he not? anne turns to face mary. the two sisters embrace tightly. exterior hever day the entire boleyn family is nervously assembled outside the house, (which we notice has been transformed at great cost. huge marquees in the gardens. fountains. additional staff. smart uniforms. new extensions to the stables and kitchens). mary is discreetly hidden, among the crowds. anne is pride of place. visibly nervous. sir thomas and lady elizabeth are beside her. the proud parents. everyone bows deeply in deference as the king arrives.}
