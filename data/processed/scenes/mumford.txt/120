<A>__{sofie appears first, but she waits for mumford before she steps tentatively onto the rock. mumford takes firm hold of her and leads her to a spot where she can securely settle herself.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{you feel like a fake, an imposter...}
<A>__{mumford looks up, sharply.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{...as if maybe you don't know what you're doing.}
<A>__{she puts a hand on his arm.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{everybody feels that way sometimes... like we're not who we're supposed to be. but i have to tell you, dr. mumford }
<A>__{he winces at her formality.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{ you've been a tremendous help to me.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{i can't tell you how much i admire you. you have a wonderful way with people. and you're very insightful. i feel like you've seen me clearly... i never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. you've made that possible for me.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{that's... good?}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{yes! and my ex husband he never accepted me for who i was, just like mother. the things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{i don't know if }
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{you're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. i've never had a man treat me this way. with you, i feel really... listened to.}
<P>__{(gives him a look)}
<D>__{can i tell you something? it's a little embarrassing, but i feel very unguarded with you.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{thanks to this therapy, i now know what i'm looking for. i need to find a man like you.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{not one who's treating me, of course.}
<P>__{(full of resolve)}
<D>__{and i'm going to do it, dammit! you've given me the confidence.}
<A>__{mumford is in agony.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{sofie... that makes me very happy.}
