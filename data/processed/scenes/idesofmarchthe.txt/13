<D>__{let me be more specific. i am neither a christian, nor an atheist, i'm not jewish or muslim...what i believe...my religion is written on a piece of parchment called the constitution. meaning i will defend, till my dying breath, your right to worship, in whatever god or lack thereof you believe in, as long as it doesn't hurt others. i believe we should be judged as a government by how we take care of those who can't take care of themselves. that's my religion. if you feel that i'm not religious enough, then don't vote for me. if you feel i'm not experienced enough or tall enough then don't vote for me. because i'm not going to change those to get elected.}
