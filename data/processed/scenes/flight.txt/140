<L>__{interior the st. jerome hotel ball room ntsb hearing day}
<A>__{on two large screens we watch the grainy cell phone footage shot by a witness of southjet flight 227's final moments in the sky. accompanying the video is the real audio of the cockpit voice recording... the room has a dais where the ntsb board members sit. a large blue curtain is the backing for the round ntsb shield that hangs above the proceedings. a large drop down screen will show images, graph and text as needed by the ntsb. a confident woman, ellen block, approaches carrying a file which she lays on the podium.}
<C>__{ellen block}
<D>__{those are difficult images to watch. for the record, i'm ellen block, hearing officer for this hearing. captain whitaker, good morning.}
<A>__{we see whip who looks rough but stable in his witness chair.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{morning.}
<C>__{ellen block}
<D>__{what was captured on that video is that the aircraft was in a relatively stable glide just prior to the moment of impact. however, according to the data we retrieved from the cockpit data recorders, at exactly 9:34, after flying 27 minutes without incident, the transponder recorded a loss in altitude in excess of 4800 feet per minute in what is considered a "full pitch nose down" attitude. then at 9:42, according to the data recorders, a decision was made to invert the aircraft. the ntsb has created animated simulation that i would like to play at this pointerior}
<A>__{ellen points to the screen... an ntsb animation shows the plane pitching down and we follow it through the inversion of the plane while listening to the real audio of the flight crew. the animation has a split screen that also shows the instruments and printed text of what's being said. we hear..."what's your son's name?" "why?" "the black box" "i love you, trevor. be a good boy, mommy loves you." "what are we doing?! why would i trim down?!" "we're gonna roll it. ready? here we go. i've got control." that last statement seems to echo as the presentation stops and the lights come back up. we return to the hearing in progress.}
<C>__{ellen block }
<D>__{that audio is tragic and compelling. i chose to play that part of the cockpit recording to highlight a key moment aboard flight 227, wherein you say "we're gonna roll it, here we go, i've got control." you made a very conscious decision to invert the airplane, to roll the plane upside down. is that correct?}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{i'm not sure it was conscious. it was more of an instinct.}
<C>__{ellen block}
<D>__{what led to that decision?}
<A>__{whip is clearly struggling in his chair. the coke got him there but it may start to fail him soon.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{i don't recall.}
<C>__{ellen block}
<D>__{let me quote from an investigative summary..."from 9:34 until 9:42 the events on the aircraft are"...again i quote, "bold and remarkable"... "by inverting the plane, captain whitaker arrested the descent and allowed the aircraft to level off enabling him to glide the aircraft away from any populated areas and allowing him to execute a forced landing in an open field.}
<A>__{we hear a smattering of applause as the facts of his actions are remarkable.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{i heard a metallic bang. we pitched nose down. no control.}
<A>__{whip looks ashen as the booze and chemicals are still coursing through his exhausted frame.}
<C>__{ellen block}
<D>__{you had no idea what was wrong with the aircraft?}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{there was a lot of things wrong with that aircraft.}
<A>__{whip glances towards hugh and charlie who are poker faced.}
<C>__{ellen block}
<D>__{as i said before you can add any details you like to any comments i make. do you remember any thing else that was out of the ordinary? did you feel the flight crew was in their best shape?}
<A>__{whip takes a minute to digest this question.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{ellen block}
<D>__{it was raining very hard the morning you took off, wasn't it?}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{there was some convective activity in the area. however, my first officer and i discussed the conditions on the field and determined that we were safely within our visibility and crosswind minimums.}
<C>__{ellen block}
<D>__{yes, first officer evans' testimony confirms the same.}
<A>__{whip goes quiet as ellen block looks at him over her glasses, seeing if he has any reaction. whip smiles.}
<C>__{ellen block }
<D>__{i want to show you something.}
<A>__{hugh is frozen in a steely gaze; charlie seems to hold his breath.}
<C>__{ellen block }
<D>__{nothing's happening.}
<A>__{ellen points her remote at the projector but it doesn't work.}
<C>__{ellen block }
<D>__{this remote is not working. apologies. i can do it manually.}
<A>__{she shrugs and heads down onto the stage closer to whip where she can advance the slides by touching the projector. we now see a screen where a slide is showing a long metal screw the size of a trombone.}
<C>__{ellen block }
<D>__{this is the jackscrew on the tail assembly which articulates the horizontal stabilizer also known as the elevator. as you can see, the threads on this screw are almost entirely gone. " substandard thread life" is how we reported it. this part was suggested as a maintenance replacement in january of 2010. it was never replaced. this had 1200 additional hours of flight on it. it finally failed.}
<B>__{an animation shows the tail assembly.}
<A>__{we watch the elevator acting as a wing on the tail that goes up or down and makes a plane get lift or descend.}
<C>__{ellen block }
<D>__{our investigators have concluded that the jackscrew snapped and the elevator was frozen in a fixed position, locking the elevator in a down position which forced the plane into a dive. the loss of the elevator was, and i quote our report, a "catastrophic event, from which recovery was improbable and stable flight impossible."}
<A>__{everyone goes quiet as those words resonate. ellen's tone changes as she understands how hard this is for some people to hear as they think of their loved ones spending their last living minutes on this earth in sheer terror. it is deathly quiet in the ballroom. even the press are silent.}
<C>__{ellen block }
<D>__{again i quote..."from 9:34 until 9:42 the piloting decisions made by captain whitaker were bold and remarkable. the fact that captain whitaker commanded that the aircraft stay inverted while descending to an extremely low altitude shows a miraculous intuition that in this instance saved 96 lives."}
<A>__{a genuine applause spreads from the hearing room. ellen block allows this moment to happen. whip is fading, dazed and uncomfortable with the unexpected adulation. he stands up.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{i appreciate that.}
<A>__{the room gets quiet as whip's demeanor seems terse. whip stares at ellen, white with sweat and chemicals. we see hugh grind his jaw as this line of questioning has him on tilt.}
<C>__{ellen block}
<D>__{mr. whitaker, i want to talk about the days leading and hours leading up to the accident. but before i do, i want to remind you that you are under oath and any testimony that you give here today will be considered admissable in any subsequent hearings or criminal proceedings, do you understand what that means?}
<A>__{whip nods.}
<C>__{ellen block }
<D>__{captain whitaker, for the record i need you to verbalize your answer.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{yes, i understand.}
<C>__{ellen block}
<D>__{on the three days leading up to the day of the accident tuesday, october 11th, wednesday, october 12th or thursday, october 13th of 2011 did you consume any alcohol or other intoxicating elements?}
<A>__{whip takes his time.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{no. i did not.}
<B>__{hugh and charlie}
<A>__{sit stone faced in the second row feeling the relief of months of hard work. ellen block continues with a rote posture...}
<C>__{ellen block}
<D>__{on the morning of the accident, friday, october 14th, did you consume any alcohol or ingest any chemicals or drugs that may have impaired your ability to perform your job?}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{no. i did not.}
<A>__{ellen wraps up this line of questions...}
<C>__{ellen block}
<D>__{mr. whitaker, do you now or have you ever had a problem with alcohol dependency, alcoholism or drug addiction?}
<A>__{whip waits for her to look at him...this takes a while...}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{hugh maintains a poker face; charlie appears relieved. ellen sorts through her notes one last time.}
<C>__{ellen block}
<D>__{okay, mr. whitaker, we're about done.}
<P>__{(she refers to her notes)}
<D>__{due to the severe turbulence during the early part of the flight, you asked the flight crew to suspend the beverage service on the plane. is that correct?}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{yes. i suspended the drink service.}
<C>__{ellen block}
<D>__{are you aware that our investigators found two single service vodka bottles in the galley trash bin?}
<A>__{slides now show the two small vodka bottles in evidence.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{ellen block}
<D>__{there were 5 crew members on board the flight who would have had access to the beverage trolley. less than an hour after the accident, blood was taken from each of the crew members. yourself...}
<A>__{a southjet corporate photo of whip pops on to the large monitors. after ellen references a member of the flight crew, their photo pops on to the monitors...}
<C>__{ellen block }
<D>__{first officer evans, flight attendant margaret thomason and posthumously from camelia satou and katerina marquez.}
<A>__{katerina marquez photo does not pop up on the screen...yet.}
<C>__{ellen block }
<D>__{a toxicology analysis was performed and three of these tests came back negative, one was disqualified for technical reasons...}
<A>__{hugh smiles satisfied.}
<C>__{ellen block }
<D>__{and one tested positive for alcohol. it registered a .17 blood alcohol level. are you aware of that?}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{i am now.}
<C>__{ellen block}
<D>__{miss marquez was not only a colleague, but you knew her outside of work? correct?}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{outside of work? not really.}
<C>__{ellen block}
<D>__{did you know miss marquez had a drinking problem?}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{no. i did not.}
<C>__{ellen block}
<D>__{did you ever see her drink to excess?}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{no. i did not.}
<C>__{ellen block}
<D>__{did you know that she was twice treated for alcohol addiction? the last time was 16 months ago and paid for by southjet airlines?}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{no. i did not.}
<A>__{a picture of trina's beautiful smiling face flashes up on the}
<B>__{big screen.}
<C>__{ellen block}
<D>__{is it your opinion that katerina marquez drank the vodka on the plane?}
<A>__{whip smiles at the photo of trina as if she can see him. he then shakes his head to snap from the memory of her great spirit. he gets serious as he bears his look down on ellen.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{can you repeat the question?}
<C>__{ellen block}
<D>__{your opinion captain. is it your opinion that katerina marquez drank on that flight?}
<A>__{whip shakes. he runs his trembling hand through his hair.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{i'm sorry. my what...}
<C>__{ellen block}
<D>__{since her toxicology report is the only toxicology report that is admissable in this hearing, and she in fact tested positive for alcohol, is it your opinion that katerina marquez drank those 2 bottles of vodka on the flight?}
<A>__{whip drops his head and mutters something inaudible.}
<C>__{ellen block }
<D>__{i'm sorry mr. whitaker, i couldn't hear you. what did you say?}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{i said...god help me...}
<A>__{a confused mumble rises in the room. whip's response flusters ellen for a moment, but she recovers quickly.}
<C>__{ellen block}
<D>__{yes, well. however, is it your opinion...}
<A>__{whip cuts her off...}
<C>__{whip}
<P>__{(excessively loud)}
<C>__{it's my opinion...}
<P>__{(lowers his voice)}
<D>__{it's my opinion... trina did not...drink the vodka.}
<C>__{ellen block}
<D>__{excuse me, mr. whitaker...}
<C>__{whip}
<P>__{(softly, to himself)}
<D>__{she saved that boy's life...}
<C>__{ellen block}
<D>__{captain whitaker can you speak louder }
<C>__{whip}
<P>__{(loud again)}
<D>__{i know for a fact that she did not drink that vodka...}
<A>__{whip stops. his whole body trembles, his face tightens. he looks right at ellen...}
<C>__{whip }
<D>__{...because i did. i drank the vodka.}
<A>__{the crowd gasps, unsure of what they just heard... charlie rockets out of his chair.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{objection!!! ntsb officer #2 please be seated sir. this is not a court room.}
<A>__{now charlie returns to his chair to find that hugh is gone. charlie looks around for hugh, no sign. he's vanished. whip leans close to the microphone.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{i drank the vodka bottles on the plane.}
<C>__{ellen block}
<D>__{mr. whitaker, in light of that remark, would you like to readdress...}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{you don't have to readdress anything. i drank the vodka!}
<C>__{ellen block}
<D>__{on the three nights before the accident, october 11th }
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{on october 11th, 12th and 13th and 14th i was intoxicated. i drank alcohol on all of those days. i drank to excess.}
<A>__{chaos erupts further as reporters outnumber security. flash bulbs pop repeatedly and large lights are aimed at the fracas on stage as video is taken of the bizarre melee.}
<C>__{ellen block}
<D>__{mr. whitaker, on the morning of october }
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{i was drunk. i'm drunk right now, miss block...i'm drunk right...}
<P>__{(whip finally breaks down)}
<D>__{i'm drunk now, because... because i'm an alcoholic.}
<A>__{we have pushed into a tight shot on whip's face as the sound in the room fades away. we stay tight on whip's face as he lets the moments unfold. suddenly the noise cuts to silence. whip is looking at the assembly. whip wipes tears from his eyes. we hear whip's voice as the dialogue pre laps the image of his face.}
<C>__{whip }
<D>__{that was it...i was done. it's as if i'd hit my life long limit for lies.}
<A>__{a new angle shows whip speaking these words...}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{i could not tell one more lie. and maybe i'm a sucker. because if i had just told one more lie? i could have walked away from that whole mess and kept my wings and my false sense of pride and most importantly i would have avoided being locked up here with all of you nice folks for the last 13 months.}
<A>__{we hear laughter as we pull out from whip to realize that he is in fact wearing a white penal jumpsuit and leading an aa meeting in a federal prison.}
<C>__{whip }
<D>__{it looks like i will serve every day of the remaining 4 plus years of my sentence. and that's fair. i betrayed the public trust. i did. that's what the judge explained to me. i had betrayed the public trust. the faa took my license. and that's fair. the chances of me flying again are slim to none. and i accept that.}
