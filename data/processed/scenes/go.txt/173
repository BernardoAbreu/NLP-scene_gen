<L>__{exterior field night (rain)}
<A>__{the supafest is still raging in the distance. adam digs through the trunk of the convertible, frantically rearranging the junk inside. he keeps looking around the lid, waiting for someone to sneak up on them. zack watches adam's fruitless arranging efforts.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{stop. okay, stop!}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{it's a miata.}
<A>__{all adam's effort, he's made enough room for a pizza. maybe.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{we'll put her in the passenger seat.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{where will i... or you...}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{in the passenger seat. holding her up.}
<A>__{adam shudders at the thought. with a flashlight, zack jumps down into the ditch. he nudges ronna's body with his foot. she's dead alright. he rolls the body over, grabbing under her arms. he tries to hoist her up, but she's too heavy and the ditch is too deep.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{little help?}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(not moving)}
<D>__{i can't.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i can't do this.}
<A>__{frustrated, zack tries again to lug the body out. he can't do it by himself. meanwhile, adam is starting to hyperventilate, tears swelling.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{okay, listen to me...}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{she's dead.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{she's not dead.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{she's dead. i hit her and i killed her.}
<A>__{he looks around, expecting someone to walk up and see them.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{no you didn't, okay? this is all just make believe. this is a scene. she's just acting dead. and you're just acting scared.}
<A>__{adam laughs to himself, still crying.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{see, there's the lights, and there's the camera. watch your blocking.}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{there's michelle in wardrobe, say "hi, michelle!"}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{hi, michelle.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{the craft service truck is right around the corner, and they have lots of little veggie burgers on the grill. and you can have one if you just help me finish this scene.}
<P>__{(sniffing)}
<D>__{can you smell them? can you smell them on the grill?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i'm not delusional.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{then take her fucking arms!}
<A>__{obeying, adam grabs ronna's wrists as zack pushes from below. together they get the body out of the ditch. zack climbs up to help maneuver her into the car. just then... ronna moans. adam freaks out, dropping his side. ronna's head hits the dirt. louder moaning.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{she's not dead.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{no shit!}
<A>__{they stand back, watching ronna moan as she lies half in, half out of the car.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{if she's not dead, that means we didn't kill her. we can just leave her.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{she's almost dead. we leave her and she dies, why did we bother coming back? i mean, you still killed her.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{what do you mean, i killed her?}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{christ, i didn't mean it that way. c'mon. i would never testify against you.}
<A>__{adam is not reassured.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{we have to stick with plan a.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{in plan a she was dead.}
<A>__{zack reaches into the car, pulling out the club. trades a look with adam, who finally acquieces. almost says something, doesn't. they both look around, making sure no one's coming. zack grips the bar like a baseball bat. adam turns his back, covering his ears. zack raises the bar. adam scrunches his face tight. zack takes two quick breaths. and holds. and holds. and holds. adam opens his eyes, looks back. zack isn't swinging. he lowers the bar. they both breathe again, relieved.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{okay. new plan.}
