<A>__{the truck screeches to a halt by the side of the road. cass gets booted out the passenger door. the door is slammed shut behind her. cass gives the guy the finger as he drives off. she turns to see a car headed her way. she starts flagging it down. but wait... yup, it's milo. shit. she looks around, but where's she gonna go? meanwhile, as milo nears, he seems to be speeding up. cass stares. he keeps coming, an evil look on his face. it looks like he is going to run her over. she turns and starts to run.}
