<L>__{interior marcus' tent day}
<A>__{maximus enters marcus' darkened tent. flickering braziers provide the only light in the enormous imperial tent. heavy beams support the canopy and they creak like the timbers of a ship as the tent sways slightly in the wind. marcus stands before a map of the roman empire.}
<C>__{maximus}
<P>__{(bows)}
<D>__{caesar.}
<A>__{marcus holds out a scroll.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{read this.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{i never acquired the art, sir.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{of course. no matter. in this letter i denote my intention to nominate you to stand for the emperorship after my death.}
<A>__{a stunned pause. maximus stares at him.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{my son is not a moral man. you have known this since you were young. he cannot rule.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{caesar, i am honored but }
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{for twenty years i have been spilling blood. for twenty years i have written philosophy and ruminated and conquered. since i became caesar i have only had four years without war. four years of peace in twenty. so perhaps i can be... forgiven.}
<A>__{a long beat.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{while i have been fighting, rome has grown mad and corpulent and diseased. i did this. and now i shall make it right.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{sire, you brought the light of the gods to barbarian darkness. you brought civilization and justice to the farthest }
<C>__{marcus}
<P>__{(fierce)}
<D>__{i have brought the sword nothing more! rome is far away and we shouldn't be here. what matter is it to the gods if we subdue one more tribe of parthians or gauls? what matter is it to rome if a thousand more barbarians bend to our lash?}
<A>__{a beat. marcus sits. he doesn't look at maximus. a pause.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{winter, maximus. it's winter now...}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{there was a dream that was rome. i can only whisper of it now. anything more than a whisper and the dream vanishes. it's so... fragile. the true glory of rome is in a very fragile idea. imagine a place devoted to the rights of the citizen. where every free man has a voice. that was the dream... and i fear it will not survive the winter.}
<A>__{he holds out a hand to maximus. maximus takes his hand, deeply moved, kneeling.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{let's just whisper here, you and i.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{yes, caesar.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{if the dream is ever to live again the people must have a true voice. the voice i took from them. that all the caesars took from them, bit by bit, conquest by conquest. and now that i am dying i am going to give them that voice again.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{you're not dying.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{i am, maximus. it's strange... i find as i near the end i think little of the waning moments around me... instead i think much of the past... and of the future. how will the world speak my name in years to come? will i be known as the philosopher? the warrior? the tyrant? or will there be a more golden sounding to my name? will i be the emperor who gave rome back her freedom?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{before i die i will give the people this final gift. i will give them the senate reborn. the voice of the people empowered again, as it was always meant to be. it is my design that they will elect the next emperor. and i would put forward your name with my backing.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{caesar, you do me honor but your son has pride of place for succession.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{you are the son i should have had... although i fear in my deepest heart that if you had truly been my son my blood would have polluted you as it did commodus. we're a cursed bloodline. we have lived so long in power and depravity that we no longer remember a life without it. we can no longer even imagine a life without it.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{look at me, son.}
<A>__{maximus looks at him.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{son... i know that one grove of your vineyard is worth more to you than all the treasures of rome. i know one loving word from your wife is worth more than the accolades of an empire. but... a fond old man, who loves you more than he can say, begs you to at least think about what he has said tonight.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{i shall, caesar.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{i will keep this letter to myself. i hope that with the sunrise you will agree. and embrace me as a father.}
<A>__{maximus nods and rises. he begins to go. stops.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{you have always been my father.}
<A>__{he goes.}
