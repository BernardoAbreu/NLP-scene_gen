<L>__{interior oogie boogie's jail. christmas eve later.}
<A>__{santa and sally dangle perilously above a pit. they've been bound and gagged and they writhe in terror. from the murky depths below, skeleton crocodiles leap up at them, jaws snapping hungrily. watching, oogie boogie snickers. he lowers santa and sally closer.}
<C>__{oogie boogie}
<D>__{scrawny ol' things they haven't eaten in centuries. i'd say it's about time we put some meat on their bones, don't you?}
<A>__{suddenly, there's a}
<B>__{crash}
<A>__{behind him the crash of the door being kicked in. and there stands}
<B>__{jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i should say so.}
<A>__{jack sweeps boogie off his feet and holds him above the pit himself. immediately, the terrorizer is terrified.}
<C>__{oogie boogie}
<D>__{jack! how great to see you. we were all worried about you. i was just giving our guests here a... a tour of the place. i told them it was dangerous, but they insisted on a closer look. what could i do?}
<A>__{he smiles sheepishly.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how about the whole show?}
<A>__{he dumps oogie boogie over the edge, but delicately keeps ahold of a choice thread. as he falls, oogie boogie unravels completely. his insides escape into the dark with the sounds of wings flapping and feet skittering and, in the end, all that's left}
<B>__{of his shapeless sack of a body is one long thread.}
<A>__{in the pit below, the crocodile skeletons scoot around, jaws clapping, having themselves a feast. later, jack finishes untying santa and sally. he works quickly. he ungags sally.}
<C>__{sally}
<P>__{(with glad relief)}
<D>__{we heard you'd been pulverized to bone dust.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{for what i did, i deserve to be bone dust.}
<A>__{jack looks away from santa's angry gaze. he takes off santa's cap and replaces it on santa's head...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{this is where it belongs... i was only trying to do a good job, but i made a real mess of everything. i'm sorry.}
<A>__{cringing, he unties santa's gag. santa scowls and straightens his cap but, rather than chastise jack, immediately makes for the door.}
<C>__{santa}
<D>__{no time to talk now... i've got to go fix christmas!}
<A>__{santa charges off.}
