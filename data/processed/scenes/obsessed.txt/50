<A>__{a male worker gives a female worker a back massage with a computer mouse. joe gage, in a santa suit, is passing out gag presents. lisa is in a group with patrick and some other women, chatting. she glances over and sees derek. he's off to the side with ben, sipping drinks. esks and furniture are shoved back and workers are free style dancing, crowding into the center of the room. arge grabs derek by the arm and pulls him out. derek makes some half hearted dance moves, then gets into the spirit. it's crowded, people are close together and a moment later, derek finds himself dancing face to face with lisa.}
