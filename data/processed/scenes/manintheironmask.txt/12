<L>__{interior a small house day}
<A>__{athos stands at the dressing table in a modest room; dressed in a dark plain coat, he too is a former musketeer gray haired and handsome, intensely intelligent, with a hard crust of manners masking seas of emotion. he opens a small wooden box and digs through medals of heroism; he finds what he's looking for just as his son raoul enters. raoul is in his mid twenties; he wears the uniform of a soldier in the french army. he is nervous, pacing, looking at every angle in the mirror.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{do i look all right?}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{none of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{i care only about michelle. should i ask her when we first arrive? or... or when we're leaving? i could ask her in the carriage but it is more romantic at the palace. i get so confused...}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{perhaps this will help.}
<A>__{he hands raoul the simple gold ring he took from the box.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{mother's ring. i can't take this.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{she died giving you to me. and i want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves.}
<A>__{they embrace. athos' eyes mist, but he smiles.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{now go, and bring back your fiance.}
<A>__{establishing the royal palace day the palace glows golden in the parisian sunshine. carriages deposit guests for the lavish party in the royal gardens.}
