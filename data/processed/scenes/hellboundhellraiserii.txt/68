<L>__{interior living room malahide's house day}
<A>__{close up malahide's hands applying wide, white, surgical bandages to julia. we pull out as malahide steps away from julia. they are both standing in the middle of the living room floor. julia's arms, torso, and head are now completely enclosed in neatly and professionally applied bandages. there are three slits for her eyes and mouth but apart from these she is completely covered. over these she is still wearing the white dress.}
<C>__{malahide}
<D>__{there...}
<A>__{julia lifts her arms slightly to look at them and then touches her bandaged face. she turns towards malahide. the camera begins the same circling movement it made around them the previous night. malahide's nervousness has practically disappeared. he has helped this woman. he has bandaged her and dressed her. he is slightly in awe of her, but it is now tinged with excitement, not fear. the camera's circling grows faster.}
<C>__{malahide}
<D>__{well?}
<A>__{julia walks towards him, slowly raising her hands. when she is close enough her hands cup his cheeks. she pulls him towards her, and, tipping her head to one side, kisses him. her body moulds itself to his. she leans her head back. were they have kissed blood has pressed up onto the bandage from her skinned flesh. it looks like smeared lipstick.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{well?}
<A>__{malahide puts his arms around her waist. they kiss tenderly. slowly, almost nervously, he lowers his hands until they rest on her buttocks and presses her in towards him. they begin to spin themselves now, echoing the camera movements. they cross the room, kissing blindly, until they come to rest against the wall that bears julia's bloody palm printerior julia twists their bodies so that malahide is pressed against the wall, and begins to move her hips forcefully and sensually against}
<B>__{malahide.}
<A>__{the camera is stationary now, watching without movement as malahide begins to raise julia's dress up her legs, her hand on his wrist, helping and encouraging. about halfway up the thigh, the bandaging disappears and the raw flesh is exposed. the kissing and the fumbling continue until they are making fast and violent love against the wall. his hands clutch tightly at her hips and he pulls his face away from the kissing to loan it on her shoulder so that we see his face as it grimaces in ecstasy. he cries out and shudders and slowly both their movements stop. he strokes at her back gently and their bodies relax.}
<C>__{julia}
<P>__{(almost coyly)}
<D>__{now all we need is a skin.}
