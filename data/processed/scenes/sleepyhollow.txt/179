<L>__{exterior western woods, tree of the dead night}
<A>__{the wind tosses leaves in swirls. the twisted tree opens wide, with a rumble shafts of light shooting out.}

<A>__{katrina sits up, groggy. lady van tassel looks down at her.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{you... you are alive.}
<C>__{lady van tassel}
<D>__{am i? or, are you and young masbath dead along with me?}
<A>__{katrina sees young masbath, and beyond him, the dying fire.}
<C>__{young masbath}
<D>__{she commands the horseman.}
<C>__{lady van tassel}
<D>__{and, quite beautifully done, wouldn't you say? it is almost over.}
<A>__{thunder again. wind starts to pick up.}
<C>__{lady van tassel}
<P>__{(of the wind)}
<D>__{he rides tonight.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{father saw you die.}
<C>__{lady van tassel}
<D>__{he saw me thrown... saw the horseman looming over me as i fled. things i wanted him to see. but, as long as i govern the horseman, he cannot harm me. baltus did not stay enough to see that. he ran as a coward, unfettered by my fate.}
<C>__{young masbath}
<D>__{then, whose body was it... ?}
<C>__{lady van tassel}
<D>__{the precious servant girl sarah. i killed her and kept her body hidden, till i needed it. and, when i return to the hollow tomorrow, my version of the truth will come to pass.}
<P>__{(faking meekness)}
<D>__{i mean, there i was that fateful day, following baltus into the woods. i did not know what he was up to... where he was going. i worried for his safety.}
<A>__{katrina cautiously moves the hand she's supporting herself with, feels a rock and clutches it.}
<C>__{lady van tassel}
<D>__{imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant. a girl who had apparently become his secret love.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{no one will believe your lies, whore.}
<C>__{lady van tassel}
<D>__{this whore will see your mouth shut forever very soon. but... i am not going to kill you. not me...}
<A>__{she picks up the horseman's skull in her gloved hand.}
<C>__{lady van tassel}
<D>__{he will have that honor.}
