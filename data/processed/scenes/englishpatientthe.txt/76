<A>__{fenelon barnes sits astride his camel, and wipes away the sweat. the desert stretches for miles, shimmering, the sun baking the sand. his guides wind their headcloths tighter. nobody speaks. then one of them looks round, raises a hand. a buzzing noise. they all turn. a small cloud of dust emerges over a ridge. locusts? a sandstorm? a caravan of cars, the almasy madox expedition, bumps along, suspensions threatened by the constant dips and ridges. on each car there are three in the passenger cabin, the open backs crammed with drums of gasoline and water and equipment. on the front vehicle, the tenth member of the party, kamal, acts as a navigator and sits on a camel saddle, a rodeo cowboy, on the roof of the leading car, driven by madox. as they spot fenelon barnes they sound their horns and wave good naturedly. f b scowls, watches them roar by, stealing his thunder.}
