<L>__{exterior festa street night}
<A>__{vito passes the booths of food, crossing toward a small and dark club.}
<L>__{interior social club night}
<A>__{we can still hear the crowds and music of the festa. vito enters; the club is empty, except for the large white figure sitting alone at a small table. fanucci barely acknowledges vito as he joins him. without a word, vito counts out two hundred dollars on the table. fanucci looks, then takes off his fedora and puts it on the table over the money.}

<P>__{(sicilian)}
<D>__{i think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat.}
<P>__{(he peeks)}
<D>__{i'm right. only two hundred dollars.}
<C>__{vito}
<P>__{(sicilian)}
<D>__{i'm a little short. i've been out of work. let me owe you the money for a few weeks.}
<C>__{fanucci}
<P>__{(sicilian)}
<D>__{ah, you're a sharp young fellow. how is it i've never noticed you before}
<P>__{(he takes the two}
<D>__{hundred and pours}
<P>__{some wine for vito)}
<D>__{you're too quiet for your own interest. i could find some work for you to do that would be very profitable.}
<P>__{(he rises)}
<D>__{no hard feelings, eh? if i can ever do you a service let me know. you've done a good job for yourself tonight.}
