<D>__{in spite of my precautions to secrecy, i half suspected that my mother knew all from the manner in which she embraced me on my arrival, and received our guest, captain grogan.}
<A>__{his mother looks a little anxious and flushed and, every now and then, gazes very hard into the captain's face.}
<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{but she would not say a word about the quarrel, for she had a noble spirit, and would as lief have seen any one of her kindred hanged as shirking from the field of honor.}
