<L>__{interior fred's bedroom day}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{let's make one.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{one what?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{a movie.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{great! that's perfect! i've already got an idea for a kind of sci fi horror thing. it's like "the shining" meets "the jetsons."}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{no, you moron. a porno film.}
<A>__{fred lights up.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{even better.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{and check this out. the best part of all, is i've got an angle.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{what kind of angle?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{we can make pornos that cater to guys like us.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{you mean virgins.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{yes. adult films made by virgins for virgins.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{with good cinematography.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{and cute, nice girls. the kind you'd want to take to dinner with your parents.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{right. no shots of sweaty guys' faces.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{and nothing up the butt.}
<A>__{they look at him.}
<C>__{fred }
<D>__{what? i don't like it when they put stuff up their butt.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{these have to be nicely edited. we should shoot on super 16 and transfer to video.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{no, matt. we'll shoot it on your video camera. we're not getting any expensive equipment.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{how are we going to get the women to star in the film?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{and the guys.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{i don't know. we'll surf the net. we'll figure it out.}
<A>__{they look at each other for a beat. finally, fred and matt crack up.}
<C>__{deacon }
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{that was really funny.}
<A>__{deacon just looks at them, pissed.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{i'm serious about this.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{we can't make a porno movie.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{do you have any idea how much trouble we'd get in?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{do you have any idea how much money we'd make?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{like how much?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{enough for a car. enough for more camera shit. to take girls out. i don't know. for whatever we want.}
<A>__{beat. beat. beat. they're thinking about it.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{what about the moral implications?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{it's a free market transaction between consenting adults. what's the problem?}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{we're not adults.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{he's got a point, deacon.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{guys, tell me the truth. haven't you ever wondered... haven't you ever imagined what it would be like to make one?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{not really.}
<A>__{deacon turns to fred, who looks guilty.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{okay. sure. i've thought about it. i've thought about shaving principal taggert's ass, too.}
<A>__{a look, then deacon gets up to seal the deal.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{look. this is an opportunity we shouldn't let slip away. if we make this movie, it could be the best year of our lives. we'll go in boys and come out men. and at the end, we'll have the money, the power, and the women. but you losers would rather play it safe. well, i'm not going to waste another minute. i'm making this porno movie with or without you. and when i show up at school in my new set of wheels, and you two limp dicks are begging me for my sloppy seconds, i will just have to tell you, "sorry, guys. that ship has sailed. you blew it."}
<A>__{ringing silence.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(sincerely)}
<D>__{that was a really good speech, deacon.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{did you work that out before?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{no, matt.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{okay... so say we were to do this. what would we call our company?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i've got it. "after school special."}
<A>__{they look at him. it's perfect.}
