<A>__{welles sees this, keeps low, watching... the big car backs out into the street. the old woman's behind the wheel, wearing a hat, driving away, alone. welles watches the car head away in the rear view mirror.}
<B>__{on the street}
<A>__{welles gets out of his car, shuts the door quietly behind him. he starts walking towards the quaint house, looks all directions, making sure no one's around. ahead, the garage door begins to close. welles picks up the pace, trying not to look too conspicuous. the garage door's halfway down... welles runs towards the garage, has to dive and roll to get there, but he makes it under the door just as it closes.}
