<L>__{int ted's apartment night}
<A>__{tight on: a computer screen where swirling signs of the zodiac act as a screen saver. pull back to reveal we are a telephone cord runs from the computer to the headset of tiffany (20s), pert, smart and dressed in a tight university of alaska t shirt. tiffany sits with her feet up on the desk as she flips through a copy of "cosmo". it's a medium sized apartment, littered with guy stuff although bowing to advancing signs of feminine influence. the phone rings. tiffany hits the space bar. the caller's number flashes on screen. by the second ring, an electronic timer kicks in and a complete file on the caller appears with name, address, background, pets... she smiles, hits "enter."}
<C>__{tiffany}
<P>__{(into her headset)}
<D>__{psychic pals. how are you today... mr. williams?}
<P>__{(pause she listens)}
<D>__{well, we are all registered psychics here. i just had a feeling you'd be calling. what's up?}
<A>__{a key in the door. a tired ted walks inside.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{hey tiff.}
<A>__{tiffany looks up, then holds up a file folder with the words "working shhhhhh!" in big black letters.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<P>__{(to caller)}
<D>__{your tv remote control? okay.}
<A>__{ted sighs, gives her a quick peck on the cheek as he wrestles off his winter gear and heads to the kitchen.}
<C>__{tiffany }
<D>__{i need you to clear your mind...}
<A>__{ted looks into the fridge, making up new words to the song "escape."}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{"if you like frozen enchiladas, getting caught in the rain. if you're not into...something brownish."}
<A>__{ted pulls out some tupperware, tries to figure out what's in it. tiffany, still wearing her headset, appears behind him, grabs a diet coke from the fridge and kisses him on the cheek.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{it's stew. i'm not sure it's still good.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{aren't you with a customer?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{they're concentrating.}
<A>__{ted grabs a fork, takes the pot and sits at the table. tiffany goes back to her desk and flips through her magazine.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(through a mouthful of food)}
<D>__{so? how's the tea leaf business today?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{i've decided from now on to ignore you when you're ignorant about my work. and it's going very well thank you.}
<P>__{(reconnecting to the caller)}
<D>__{mr. williams, i'm seeing sofa cushions. do you have a sofa? good. glad i could help.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you here from that software distributor guy?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{no, but i did crack that code problem. you know how sometimes when you're running beta versions you }
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{english, please.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{there was a boo boo, but i fixed it.}
<P>__{(another call comes in)}
<D>__{psychic pals, how are you today, carol? now i thought we'd agreed god is everywhere, but not specifically in your coffee pot.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{jeez, tiff.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{jeez, ted. do i tell you how to do your job?}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(kidding... kind of)}
<D>__{no, but then again i'm not a computer aided pseudo psychic, so if you're looking for moral equivalence...}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{before you say anything else that may keep us from having sex ever again, let me ask you something...}
<A>__{she picks up her magazine.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{tiff, please. i always get these wrong.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{that's why we keep trying. now, love is sacrifice test.}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{if you were in a life raft with me and there was only enough water }
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{don't you have a customer?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<P>__{(to the caller)}
<D>__{carol? god says he's busy with a famine right now, but you should keep praying. cool.}
<A>__{she hangs up. turns back to ted, about to pick up where she left off...}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{no. i'm not doing it.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{it's just a stupid quiz.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{exactly.}
<A>__{the phone rings. tiffany bolts to her desk, sits, spins in her chair as she answers the call.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{psychic pals. is this the first time you've called us mrs...?}
<A>__{tiffany at her computer, enters the name "margaret barnell" into her database. tiffany works a "mute" button as she points back to the magazine.}
<C>__{tiffany }
<D>__{but stupid quizzes can be illustrative of potential relationship problems.}
<P>__{(to her caller)}
<D>__{margaret, i'm getting the feeling this is an anxious day for you.}
<A>__{ted, cooking pot in hand, walks over to her desk.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{our only relationship problem is you're running a $1.99 a minute carny scam out of my living room.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{don't call it a scam.}
<P>__{(to the caller startled)}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{you've got to learn to channel that rage, margaret.}
<P>__{(to ted playful)}
<D>__{you didn't just call this your living room, did you?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i meant ours. ours, ours, ours.}
<A>__{tiffany returns to her call, but keeps looking at ted.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{i feel someone you really care about, maybe even the love of your life, is being a real pain. now i need you to concentrate...}
<A>__{ted pretends to do just that, drawing a giggle from tiffany before he walks off.}
