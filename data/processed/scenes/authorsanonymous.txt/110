<D>__{the washed up, impotent novelist getting gunned down by scott, the jealous, underemployed, pizza delivery man. this kid nailed it. it's on the page, know what i mean? so i intend to sign mr. henry obert and get pizza to go out there. i predict a best seller. probably a movie, too. i will call him with the good news. or maybe i will just order a pizza.}
