<L>__{interior max's apartment day}
<A>__{max examines the smashed euclid mainframe. he uncovers some of the strange filo like substance. he carefully touches it. then he grabs a small pinch of it. he examines it near a light bulb. he can't guess what it is. he sniffs it. he carefully tastes it with the very tip of his tongue. he still doesn't have a clue. max opens his closet. he pulls out his dusty brass microscope. he dusts it off. next, he pulls out a slide kit. max places the instrument on the windowsill. he grabs an old glass slide and puts some of the flaky stuff on it. he slides it under the microscope. he looks into the lens, but doesn't see anything. he gets up quickly and heads for the}

<A>__{where he looks at devi's door, nervously. he gathers his courage and knocks on her door. through the door hears.}
<C>__{devi }
<D>__{farrouhk?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{um, no, it's max from next door.}
<A>__{devi opens the door wearing a sexy nightshirt.}
<C>__{devi}
<D>__{max, is everything all right?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{do you have any iodine?}
<C>__{devi}
<P>__{(concerned, she reaches for max's hands)}
<D>__{iodine...did you cut yourself?}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(pulling his hands away)}
<D>__{no. i just need it to stain a slide.}
<C>__{devi}
<D>__{ah, science, the pursuit of knowledge. one second.}
<A>__{she heads to her bathroom. max waits impatiently.}
<C>__{devi }
<D>__{here we are. what are you examining}
<P>__{(at the door)}
<D>__{a potato!?}
<A>__{she hands max a bottle of iodine.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{just something with my computer.}
<A>__{max's room moments later max uses his pinky to drip a drop of iodine on the slide. through the wall he hears farrouhk arriving home.}
<C>__{devi }
<D>__{the neighbor's up to his old science...}
<C>__{farrouhk }
<D>__{what neighbor?}
<C>__{devi }
<D>__{next door.}
<A>__{max listens to the conversation for a few moments.}
<C>__{farrouhk }

<C>__{farrouhk }
<D>__{pounds on wall. hey, dork, leave my girlfriend alone!}
<C>__{devi }
<D>__{farrouhk!}
<A>__{max shakes his bead. then he finishes preparing the slide and slips the glass under the turret. max catches the low hanging sun in the microscope's mirror and reflects it through the sample and up the turret into his eye. max's pov down the turret of some strange substance. max pulls out the slide and looks at it.}
<C>__{farrouhk }
<D>__{i don't give a shit.}
<C>__{devi }
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{shh! c'mon, farrouhk.}
<C>__{farrouhk }
<D>__{i will kill the dork.}
<P>__{(exploding again)}
<D>__{you hear me! i will kill you. i will fucking kill you!}
<A>__{then an idea comes to him. he takes out his brain book. he looks through it until he finds a picture of neurons. he compares the image to the view through the turret. they look different but there are similarities.}
<C>__{devi }
<D>__{shh! baby! come here, baby!}
<A>__{max rushes out.}
