<A>__{the delivery truck's engine has stalled and is off.}
<C>__{pizza deliverer }
<D>__{c'mon, man, hurry up. um, like the pizza's are getting cold here.}
<A>__{woody and buzz eye the parked delivery truck from within the safety of a nearby oilcan display.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{uh huh. and when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{well, then let's climb abroad.}
<A>__{buzz makes a beeline for the passenger side door of the pizza truck. woody chases after him.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{no, no, no, wait, buzz, buzz, let's get in the back. no one will see us there.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{negative. there are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area. we'll be much safer in the cockpit.}
<A>__{in a flash, buzz has scaled the front tire, grabbed the rear view mirror, and swung himself up and into the cab.}

<C>__{woody}
<P>__{(loud whisper)}
<D>__{buzz!}
<A>__{sfx: engine starting woody runs around to the back of the truck, scrambles up the bumper and throws open the back hatch to climb inside. woody lets out a yell, as the back hatch slams back down on his rear, sending him flying into the bed of the truck.}
