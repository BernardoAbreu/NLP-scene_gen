<L>__{interior opera house night 1780's}
<A>__{salieri conducting the last scene from axur: king of ormus. on stage we see a big scene of acclamation: the hero and heroine of the opera accepting the crown amidst the rejoicing of the people. the decor and costumes are mythological persian. the music is utterly conventional and totally uninventive. cu, mozart watching this in his box, with schikaneder and the three actresses. he passes an open bottle of wine to them. he is evidently a little drunk, but keeps a poker face. the act comes to an end. great applause in which mozart joins in, standing and shouting 'bravo! bravo!' then he leaves the box with schikaneder and the girls.}
