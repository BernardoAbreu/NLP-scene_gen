<A>__{the wind has really picked up now. a massive lightning bolt streaks the sky, officially announcing the storm's onset. a police cruiser pulls up to the guard gate.}
<L>__{interior woodward surveillance booth}
<A>__{pan off the bank of monitors to the same two guards we've seen before. playing yet another bored card game. the light rapping on their glass door makes them look up.}
<D>__{guard #1 help you?}
<A>__{two officers stand there. we recognize one of them:}
<C>__{officer turlington}
<D>__{we're here on miranda grey detail.}
<A>__{the guards shake their heads, chuckle.}
<D>__{guard #1 sixth floor. you can get a couple chairs from the nurses up there. a pretty decent cup of joe too.}
<C>__{officer turlington}
<D>__{thanks, guys.}
<A>__{the guard points at the bank of monitors.}
<D>__{guard #1 although why the sheriff is making you fellas waste your time is beside me. we got her right here. she ain't going no place.}
<B>__{on monitor}
<A>__{miranda inside her pristine white cell. restlessly pacing.}
<C>__{officer turlington}
<D>__{looks perfectly harmless, doesn't she? guard #1 don't they all, officer, don't they all?}
<A>__{the men share a chuckle over that one when suddenly thunder crackles and the power goes out. no monitors, no radio, no nothing. pitch black.}
<D>__{guard #1 shit. there goes the card game.}
<A>__{abruptly there's a series of sharp clicks as four flashlights come alive.}
