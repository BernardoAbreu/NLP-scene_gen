<L>__{interior darwin's bedroom. the present. day.}
<A>__{there are some faint stains on the plasterwork of the bedroom ceiling. like lichen on a rock. like an archipelago of islands. darwin lies, pale and weak, looking upwards from a sea of white blankets. the door opens and he turns his head. its emma.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{you have a visitor.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{no. no. i will not be bled or lectured to.}
<A>__{she gives him a pinched look, then hooker pushes in behind her.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{it is me. thank god you are still with us. word came from london you had suffered an apoplectic stroke.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{no. simply the great relief of liberation. did you read the wallace abstract.}
<A>__{hooker bats the idea away}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{it is a letter. you have a book}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{...barely half of it}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{you have a book. what is not already on the page is most certainly inside your head and i intend to extract it, if it kills us both.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{you have been talking to huxley.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{no. had i done so he would have hastened here himself armed with every instrument of torture known to her majesty's navy.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{charles i have read the first chapters. it is brilliant. you must continue.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{i cannot. seriously joseph, i am completely blocked. all my old symptoms have returned with a vengeance. the sweats the shakes the abdominal pains. the whole endeavour was cursed from the outset.}
<A>__{hooker takes darwins hand, presses it to stop it from trembling}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{charles. it was you who opened my eyes to the wonders of science. so let me open yours. you have an illness. you have had it as long as i have known you.}
<C>__{hooker }
<D>__{it is clearly made worse in times of overwork but the nature of the work is irrelevant. this is not visited on you by god or the devil. this is a set of physical symptoms. go to malvern and get treated.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{not malvern}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{why not. what is there to be scared of there. he has worked for you in the past it will work again. then come back and finish the book. your enemies are already toasting their good fortune but they shall not prevail.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{what are you talking about. i have no enemies.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{they are legion, believe me, and they are implacable. we are all of us fighting a battle against fear and superstition but we can win this battle. we must win it. you can win it for all of us. go to malvern, then come back and finish it.}
