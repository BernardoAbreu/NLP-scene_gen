<L>__{interior bathroom. day}
<A>__{cheryl sits down on the edge of the tub and takes a couple of deep breaths.}
<L>__{interior carmen's place. day}
<A>__{mark, his body now under the sheets, looks towards the bathroom door. he can hear the sound of water running. he looks at a wall clock and notes the passing of time.}
<L>__{interior bathroom. day}
<A>__{cheryl turns off the tap. she has done a great job of pulling herself together, and is wrapped in a kimono, which she has brought herself.}
<L>__{interior carmen's place. day}
<A>__{cheryl emerges from the bathroom and starts to undress.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{ready?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{cheryl continues undressing, mark looks away.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{okay, the difference between me and a prostitute is that i don't want your return business. i'm here to help you communicate about your sexual feelings, so you can share them with a future partner.}
<A>__{she stands there for a few moments, but he keeps his eyes averted. she turns back the sheets, gets into bed beside him and he finally looks at her.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{whenever i'm naked, everyone else in the room is usually dressed. now that i'm in bed with another naked person, i'm very confused.}
<A>__{she strokes his hair.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{so, why is it confusing?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'd always expected that god, or my parents, would intervene to keep this moment from happening.}
<A>__{she slides her hand down. she can feel his heart thumping.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{mark, close your eyes and focus on your sense of touch.}
<A>__{he closes his eyes.}
<C>__{cheryl }
<D>__{i'd like you to tell me how it feels each time i touch a different part of your body. if something feels good, tell me. if something feels ticklish or bothers you, let me know. i don't want you to tolerate anything. i'm going to start with the top of your head...}
<A>__{she strokes his hair.}
<C>__{cheryl }
<D>__{you have soft hair. it's nice to the touch. so you like it?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i do.}
<A>__{she moves her fingers round behind his ear, then the front of his ear.}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{that feels weird.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{weird good? or weird bad?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{just weird.}
<A>__{she moves her hand down his neck.}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{his shoulder.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{still good?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{everything good so far, except the ear.}
<A>__{she moves her fingers along his side, very, very lightly. for mark, so far, this is the best.}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{are these the body awareness exercises?}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{you're clever to have worked that out.}
<A>__{her hands massage their way down his torso. mark's reactions are a little like shock waves.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{people tell me i'm very perceptive.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{would you like to see what i feel like?}
<A>__{she carefully takes his hand and caresses the fingers around one of her breasts, then puts his hand back. cheryl's hands move further down his body.}
<C>__{cheryl }
<D>__{are you wearing cologne?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{mmm, my favorite brand. okay, i'm going to move my hand along your stomach... and down to your pen...}
<A>__{the expression on mark's face changes to one of shock, then agony, then ecstasy.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{oh, oh.}
