<D>__{...is it's programmed in a forty year old dead operating system no one uses anymore. it was something called...windows.}
<L>__{exterior mars day}
<A>__{none of them have ever heard of it.}
<C>__{bowman }
<D>__{we're getting a copy of it from the smithsonian. we're gonna have to download it to you.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{let's worry about it when we get there. where're we going?}
<C>__{bowman }
<D>__{i've got coordinates for you.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{how 'bout something simpler. like how many degrees it is off from the direction the sun rose. we marked it. i'm figurin' we're within half a degree.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{heck, we just gotta pack.}
<A>__{he picks up a satchel of tools. everything else's burnt to a cinder. same scene five minutes later basic trig has been calculated. a triangle of scavenged wire stretches with one side along the directional, the other side points their way across the martian landscape. they take a last sighting, and stride off into the distance getting smaller and smaller and then on the three of them. pettengill looks doubtful.}

<D>__{it took us six hours to go 26 kilometers last time. we don't have the rebreathers, we don't have the tanks.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{figure you weigh about fifty pounds in this gravity. we have a chance in hell. but not much more'n that.}
