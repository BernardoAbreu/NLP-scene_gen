<L>__{interior pub day}
<A>__{the place is practically empty. bret and trevor play darts and work on a pitcher of beer. country western plays on the jukebox.}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{i've got a better offer. more time off. a sort of career shift, more in the engineering line of work.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{how much time off?}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{as much as he feels like. its a much more pleasurable line of work.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{as much as he likes?}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{yahtzee. were all in this together trev. trevor there are people who are doing exactly what we're doing but they don't need to wear a tie, punch a clock or have some tight assed supervisor breathing down their necks. its all about the pleasure trevor!}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{so you're just packing it up just like that?}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{almost that fast. i got a few loose ends to tie up first. came into a shitload of money recently. i've always wanted to go to take a trip. we're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{yeah? you and who else?}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{someone special.}
<A>__{bret throws a dart with extra mph. it misses the board entirely and hits the wall. trevor winces in pain suddenly. he touches his head and looks at his fingers. fresh blood.}
<B>__{flashback}
<A>__{trevor in the car in the water. thrashing about, he bleeding from his head in the flashback as well. where's kristy? he looks in the passenger seat. she's gone. trevor takes the cube from the man with the ring. he fumbles with the puzzle box in the darkness. cu box. it starts to move. trevor driving with kristy, she's going down on him while he's driving.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{okay pull over.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(looking at his watch)}
<D>__{but... i thought...}
<A>__{trevor waits a moment to see if she's kidding.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<P>__{(through clenched teeth)}
<D>__{pull over now.}
<A>__{the car comes to a stop. trevor gets the goods while he watches himself in the rear view mirror. someone approaches. trevor zips up, pulls kristy up out of his lap. its a cenobite. trevor screams and opens the door of the car to make a frantic exit. he dive out onto the pavement and looks back. all is quiet. he's alone a quiet road. he stands up and into an eerie world of slow motion . trevor looks up the road and back to find a beautiful vision of allison walking toward him. walking gracefully, she approaches trevor. raises her hand to his face. trevor smiles, then slowly looks back towards the car. inside the car he see's kristy playing with the puzzle box. trevors calls out to her.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{kristy noooo!}
<A>__{and he makes a move toward the car, as the box comes to life. this stops trevor in his tracks, and he looks toward allison. who is now pinhead.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{there is no reprieve for you. not even in her. she's only a vision i'm afraid.}
<A>__{tervors looks dumbfounded.}
<C>__{pinhead }
<D>__{the truth hurts doesn't it?}
<B>__{end flashback}
