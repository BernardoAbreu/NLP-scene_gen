<C>__{seth}
<D>__{you...huff...bailed on me...huff...man.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{no i didn't!}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{of course you did! we were supposed to do something and you left instead of doing it! that's the definition of bailing!}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{if you said we should burn our dicks off and i didn't, that's not bailing!}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{it is bailing, if you promised to burn your dick off!}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{the bottom line is you're a bailer. you just bailed on me, you bailed on me this morning when terry spat on me, and you're bailing on me next year!}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{oh! okay! there it is! it finally comes out!}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{we were supposed to go to college together! since elementary school! what ever happened to that!}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{what happened to that, is that you're too stupid to get into the schools i did!}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i was not too stupid, i was too lazy!}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{you've wasted all my time, you selfish bastard!!! instead of chasing girls and making friends, i threw away the last three years talking bullshit with you! and now, because of you, i'm going to college a fucking friendless virgin!}
<A>__{seth can't believe it. he's extremely hurt.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{getting with a girl won't make you any less of a loser next year!}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{you talking to me or yourself? you fucking loser!}
<A>__{seth drops one of the tide bottles and shoves evan hard. evan shoves him back.}
