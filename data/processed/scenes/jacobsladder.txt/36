<L>__{interior a bedroom night}
<T>__{cut to jacob :}
<A>__{lying in a bedroom we have not seen before. he is tossing and turning in his bed as though struggling to get out. suddenly he sits up and looks over at the window. it is open and the shade is flapping. cold air is blowing in and he is shivering.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{damn! you and your fresh air.}
<A>__{he jumps out of bed and goes over to the window. he pushes at the frame and it comes flying down with a loud bang. a woman in the bed sits up. it is sarah.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{it's freezing.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i'm not cold.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{of course not. you have all the blankets. it must be ten degrees in here. i'm telling you, sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. from now on that window is closed.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{it's not healthy with it closed.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{this is healthy? i will probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy.}
<A>__{he settles back into bed and pulls the covers back over to his side. he lies quietly for a moment, thinking.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{what a dream i was having. i was living with another woman ... you know who it was?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i don't want to know.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{jezebel, from the post office. you remember, you met her that time at the christmas party. i was living with her. god, it was a nightmare. there were all these demons and i was on fire. only i was burning from ice.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{guilty thoughts. see what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{she was good in bed, though.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{go to sleep.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{she had these real beefy thighs. delicious.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i thought you said it was a nightmare?}
<A>__{suddenly, out of nowhere, we hear the tinkling sound of a music box. a young boy enters the room, carrying a musical lunch box in his arms. he is wearing a long t shirt nearly down to his ankles. we recognize him from his photograph. it is gabe.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{daddy, what was that noise?}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(surprised to see him)}
<D>__{gabe?}
<P>__{(he stares curiously at his son)}
<D>__{what are you doing ... ?}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{there was a bang.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{it was the window.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{it's cold.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{tell your mother.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{mom, it's ...}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i heard you. go back to sleep.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{will you tuck me in?}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(not happily)}
<D>__{oh ... all right.}
<A>__{she starts to rise. jacob stops her and gets up instead. he whisks gabe upside down and carries him into his gabe's bedroom night bedroom, licking his belly and tickling him all the way. gabe laughs and snuggles into his pillow as soon as he hits the bed. jed, 9, and eli, 7, are both in bunk beds across the room. jed looks up.}
<C>__{jed}
<D>__{dad?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{jed. it's the middle of the night.}
<P>__{(he kisses gabe and goes}
<D>__{over to jed in the lower}
<P>__{bunk)}
<D>__{what's up?}
<C>__{jed}
<D>__{you forgot my allowance.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{your allowance? it's five a.m. we'll talk at breakfast.}
<C>__{jed}
<D>__{okay, but don't forget.}
<A>__{suddenly another voice pipes in from the top bunk.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i love you, dad.}
<A>__{jacob smiles.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what is this, a convention? i love you, too, pickles. now go back to sleep.}
<A>__{he turns to leave.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{wait ... daddy.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{now what?}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{don't go.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{don't go?}
<P>__{(he smiles)}
<D>__{i'm not going anywhere. i'm right here, gabe.}
<P>__{(he looks at his son tenderly)}
<D>__{come on, go back to sleep. you can still get a couple of hours.}
<A>__{he hugs him warmly and then walks to the door.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{... i love you.}
<A>__{there is deep emotion and seriousness in gabe's words. jacob is struck by them.}
<C>__{gabe}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{don't shut the door.}
<A>__{jacob nods and leaves it a tiny bit ajar.}
<C>__{gabe}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{a bit more ... a bit more.}
<A>__{jacob adjusts the opening enough to please gabe and make him secure. gabe smiles and cuddles in his bed.}
