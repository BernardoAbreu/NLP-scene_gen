<L>__{interior headmistress's office. day}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{how far advanced are these ridiculous plans? have you set a date? have you decided on a church?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{we won't be getting married in a church. david's jewish.}
<A>__{the headmistress stares at her, dumbfounded.}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{jewish? he's a jew? you're aware, i take it, that the jews killed our lord?}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(beginning to feel less}
<D>__{intimidated by her}
<P>__{surroundings)}
<D>__{and you're aware, i suppose, that our lord was jewish?}
<A>__{the headmistress snorts scornfully}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{i suppose he told you that. we're all very sorry about what happened in the war. but there's no excuse for that sort of malicious and untruthful propaganda.}
<A>__{jenny smiles to herself.}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{anyway, i can now see that you are even more in need of responsible advice than i realised. is it true that you don't intend to sit for your exams? and therefore you won't be applying for university?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{yes, that's right.}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{what do you think you're doing?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{nobody has been able to explain to me the point of university. therefore i don't see the point of the exams, either.}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{nobody does anything worth doing without a degree.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{and nobody does anything worth doing with one, either. no woman, anyway.}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{so what i do isn't worth doing. or what miss stubbs does, or mrs wilson, or any of us here.}
<A>__{jenny doesn't say anything. the headmistress takes her silence as an admission of defeat.}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{because none of us would be here without our degrees, you realise that, don't you? and yes, of course studying is hard, and boring, and...}
<A>__{jenny can't contain herself any longer.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{boring!}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{i'm sorry?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{studying is hard and boring. teaching is hard and boring. so you're telling me to be bored, and then bored, and then finally bored again, this time for the rest of my life. this whole stupid country is bored. there's no life in it, or colour in it, or fun in it. it's probably just as well that the russians are going to drop a nuclear bomb on us any day now. so my choice is either to do something hard and boring, or to marry my... my jew, and go to paris and rome and listen to jazz and read and eat good food in nice restaurants and have fun. it's not enough to educate us any more, mrs walters. you've got to tell us why you're doing it.}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{because without formal qualifications...}
<A>__{she grinds to a halt. she has never had to answer this question before.}
<C>__{headmistress}
<D>__{it doesn't have to be teaching, you know. there's the civil service.}
<A>__{jenny stands up.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i don't wish to be impertinent, mrs walters. but it is an argument worth rehearsing. you never know. someone else might want to know what the point of it all is, one day.}
<A>__{she leaves the office.}
