<L>__{interior exterior mace's limo night}
<A>__{as mace pulls out, lenny starts fitting a pair of playback trodes to his head. mace glances at him in disgust. he hits his playback button. lenny's pov as he talks to faith. back when things were good. he's wiring her. they are playful, like a couple of kids.}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{i feel like you're turning me into a vcr.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{i just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.}
<A>__{he turns off the record button. static. then tape restarts. we see the two of them standing together, reflected in a mirror. we are faith now.}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{i don't feel anything. is it on?}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{forget it's there.}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{make me forget it, baby.}
<A>__{he turns her to him. they begin to make love. faith's face fills our field of view, eyes closed in dreamy passion. a sudden flash of light. lenny opens his eyes to see... mace's glowing countenance. she has stopped the car, torn the trodes from lenny's head and tossed them out the window. now she's yanking him out of the car by his lapels.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{hey, careful on the jacket. this is armani.}
<P>__{(he looks at her)}
<D>__{you angry?}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{i've had enough of this shit.}
<P>__{(getting back into the car)}
<D>__{you're on foot, lenny.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{in la? are you crazy?}
<A>__{mace starts to peel out, but lenny leaps and plasters himself on the hood. mace pretends she doesn't see him.}
<C>__{lenny}
<P>__{(as they drive along)}
<D>__{can i come in please? i'm having a hard time hearing the stereo.}
<A>__{mace jams on the brakes and lenny slides off in front of the car. now she starts to move forward...}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{i need my case. it's still in the back.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{get it.}
<A>__{he quickly moves around the car and climbs in the back door. lenny grabs his haliburton but instead of getting out, he leans through the divider window, next to mace.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{listen, can we talk a little bit here, like two rational adults?}
<A>__{mace hits a button on the dash. the privacy divider rises suddenly, pinning lenny to the ceiling.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{that would be no.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{i've had it. no more wirehead shit in my car. you understand? you want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{okay, you got my attention, but this is cutting off the circulation to my head, here. d'you mind?}
<A>__{she lowers the divider, releasing him. lenny straightens his jacket and tie. runs a hand through his greasy hair.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{i thought we were friends.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{no, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another. you just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act. well i'm out. i got a kid, i got rent, i got an ex husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... i'm just trying to hold on here.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{so am i. just trying to get by.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{no, you're just trying to get off.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{macey... i've never seen you like this.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid head low life. you're always broke, you just go from one score to the nexterior and you're getting strung out... you don't even see it. getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{i know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. thanks, mace. really.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{look, i gotta get some sleep.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{you still like me, don't you? we're still buddies?}
<A>__{she hates it that she can't resist his pathetic charm.}
<C>__{mace}
<P>__{(a tiny smile)}
<D>__{yeah. i don't see a way out of it.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{macey, i know you're tired, but can you drop me at the retinal fetish? it's on your way.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{jesus, lenny.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{begging? groveling? any pathetic behavior at all? will that help? faith's there tonight, and i've got to talk to her.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{sure, lenny.}
<P>__{(she puts the car in gear)}
<D>__{the only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love.}
