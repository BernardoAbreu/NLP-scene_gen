<A>__{nicole sits before the makeup mirror. lorde, the male makeup artist picks up a tube of preparation h and begins applying it under nicole's eyes just as nick walks up.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{jesus, what are you doing?}
<C>__{lorde}
<D>__{shrinking tissue. that's what this stuff is for. let that sit for two minutes, pumpkin; i will be right back.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{how'd you get here?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{took a taxi.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{oh. we've been waiting in front of your apartment for half an hour.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{god, i'm sorry, nick. something came up. i forgot to call. i'm sorry, i feel like such an asshole.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you're just saying that because you have preparation h on your face.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{i never should have gone out last night. i hate jazz. god, i look terrible.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{no you don't.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{don't bullshit me, nick.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i'm not. you really look beautiful.}
<A>__{something in nick's voice makes nicole glance up at him. he looks away quickly. the moment is awkward, as if they both realize he has inadvertently revealed something. just then palomino approaches.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{hey! how'd you get here, nicole?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{i took a cab.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{oh, cause we were wondering how you got here.}
<A>__{nick looks at both of them in a moment of silence.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{alright, good; everybody's here. we'll do a run through as soon as you guys are ready.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{you got it, chief.}
<A>__{lorde reenters as nick leaves. palomino sits in the chair beside nicole and lorde immediately begins his makeup. no one speaks.}
