<L>__{interior hallway den}
<A>__{johnny moves through the house, looking for her. as he passes the den, he sees tyler standing inside, and goes into the dark room. it is the only personalized space we have seen in the house. a kind of shrine to the bodhisattva. shelves filled with books and artifacts from his travels. maori masks, a blowgun, a skeletal shark mouth two feet across, a huge fossil ammonite... an unbelievable variety of tribal artifacts and marine specimens. the books include political literature, eastern religion, philosophy. a strange hodgepodge of titles and authors: nietzsche, marx, the tao, "steal this book", "the book of five rings", frederick forsyth thrillers. tyler is looking at a wall of photographs and johnny walks up behind her. shots of bodhi surfing a monster wave, mountain biking, skydiving, flying an ultralight airplane, bungee cord jumping, cliff diving. every kamikaze activity in the book.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. i hope you're not buying into this banzai bullshit like the rest of bodhi's moonies.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{i've seen that kamikaze look, johnny. you've got it. and bodhi can smell it a mile away. he'll take you to the edge... and past it.}
<P>__{(she looks past}
<D>__{johnny, sees}
<P>__{something)}
<D>__{hey, bodhi.}
<A>__{utah turns. bodhi is in the doorway.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{johnny has his own demons, don't you, johnny?}
<A>__{bodhi seems to stare into him. utah breaks the look. turns back to the photo gallery. bodhi's eyes swivel. he ponders something. looks at tyler.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{feel it?}
<A>__{roach and some of the other surfers appear in the hallway, wondering what happened to their leader. he turns to them.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{gentlemen, it's time.}
<A>__{hoot and cheers. everyone bursts into motion. yelling and running through the house.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{what's goin' on?}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{swell's here, johnny. bodhi always knows.}
<A>__{bodhi returns from another room with... an all black surfboard. it gleams like obsidian. near the tip, in small gray letters it says "stealth fighter". bodhi thrusts it into johnny's hands. the others whoop maniacally. johnny feels the challenge. the pull of the tribe.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{let's go, utah. time for a little stealth mission.}
