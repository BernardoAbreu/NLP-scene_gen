<D>__{well, norman is the logical extension of the boys in those movies. appealing, sensitive, suffering the terrible burden of being forced to pretend to be something he is not.}

<P>__{(laughing nervously)}
<D>__{you see i've been guilty my whole life, mr. hitchcock.}
<A>__{hitch is enthralled.}

<D>__{try to remember this is all just make believe.}
<A>__{perkins wishes he could be more reassured...}
<C>__{anthony perkins}
