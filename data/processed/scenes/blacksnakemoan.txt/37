<L>__{interior lazarus's home kitchen night}
<A>__{he gently cradles the guitar in his big hands and sits at his kitchen table. tunes the strings. he closes his eyes, swimming in drunken sorrow.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{you gonna do this?}
<A>__{laz plays the blues, mississippi, bentonian style: one guitar, one voice, a mess of pain.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<P>__{(singing, his eyes closed)}
<D>__{just like a bird without a feather, you know i'm lost without your love. just like a bird without a feather, you know i'm lost without your love. you know i need your love just like the angels need heaven above.}
<A>__{the music continues as we:}
