<A>__{the limo slides broadly through a turn, side slamming a parked van. mace accelerates. the truck stays with them. engelman is leaning out the passenger side window with an ak 47 assault rifle. he rips off several burst which riddle the limo, cracking the glass in starburst patterns. the lexan laminated windows are cracked to hell, but the rounds don't come all the way through. spreg's truck comes alongside, ramming them. the impact drives them sideways. mace swerves to miss a light standard and finds herself roaring between warehouse buildings which front the harbor. the truck stays right with them. engelman fires bursts at the tires, shredding them off the rims. the limo thunders along on steel rims, throwing rooster tails of orange sparks. mace finds herself boxed in by the buildings. no way to turn. ahead is a short concrete pier. she hits the brakes and the limo skids on its rims out onto the pier, stopping before it reaches the end. they are trapped.}
