<L>__{exterior santa maria deck night}
<A>__{the ship is plowing on, pushed by a hot wind sailors sleep on deck. the ship's boy is singing to himself. despite his hair lip he has a pure, melancholy voice... columbus, leaning over the prow rail, staring ahead, hears it carry over the darkness.}
<L>__{exterior santa maria deck day}
<A>__{close up on an hour glass, nearly through its time. the ship's boy throws an "ampoulette" over board. we follow the bulb attached to a rope, passing the full length of the hull. as it reaches the poop deck, another sailor shouts "mark". a very primitive system of calculation for distance and speed. sitting near the ship's boy, columbus is making entries in a log book, watching the hourglass.}
<C>__{ship's boy}
<D>__{mark. twenty nine, sir!}
<A>__{the hour glass runs out. columbus converts the mark into a daily average for distance and speed.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{six hundred and twenty nine.}
<A>__{the ship's boy cups his hands to his mouth to shout.}
