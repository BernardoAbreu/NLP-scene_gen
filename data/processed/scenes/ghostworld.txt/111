<A>__{she continues walking as the sun has set and there is a calm stillness to the city. she turns a corner and is startled by her reflection in a large window made of one way glass. she stops and looks at herself. everything about her looks perfect for once; no need to change a thing. she moves closer to the glass and, shading her eyes, tries to look inside. she continues walking. darkness is just setting in and she has the street all to herself.}
