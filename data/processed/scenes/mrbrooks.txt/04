<L>__{exterior street night}
<A>__{a silver lexus ls 430 glides past us.}
<C>__{emma }
<D>__{did you see sis wallace's dress?}
<L>__{interior lexus n night}
<A>__{mr. brooks is driving. emma is in the passenger seat. they're holding hands.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{you could see her nipples. at her age she should keep those things hidden.}
<A>__{mr. brooks is only listening to his wife with one ear and underneath what she is saying we can barely hear:}
<C>__{mr. brooks }
<D>__{god grant me the serenity to accept...}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{the only thing that would have made this evening more perfect is if jane had been here.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{she called. she has mid terms coming up.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{she's dropping out, you know.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{we'll see.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{nothing she does is wrong to you, is it?...}
<A>__{mr. brooks doesn't rise to the bait.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{well she missed a good party...}
<A>__{as she continues, we look at mr. brooks and emma's voice fades to a murmur. in the back seat, a man leans out from behind mr. brooks's head. this is marshall. he's 50 plus. emma can neither see nor hear him. marshall exists only in mr. brooks's mind.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{come on, earl, give yourself a break, you know you want to do this.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{you're the fucking 'man of the year', you deserve it. it's not like it's not set up. you already know how to by pass the alarm, you know how to pick the locks. tonight's the perfect night.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<P>__{(over his shoulder)}
<D>__{no, marshall, i said 'no'!}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{i heard you, earl, but you don't mean 'no'.}
<A>__{emma feels mr. brooks's distance.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<A>__{mr. brooks pulls himself back into the moment.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{you were frowning.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{i was thinking of what i didn't say in the speech.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{they laughed, they were touched, i don't think anyone felt left out.}
<C>__{marshall}
<P>__{(from the back seat)}
<D>__{they have their dance class tonight. what if we go by and just look at them. there's no harm in just having a look.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{no means 'no', marshall.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{please... pretty please.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<P>__{(to emma)}
<D>__{the food tonight was very good, but i wasn't crazy about the dessert. would you like to stop somewhere and get something sweet?}
