<L>__{int prescott saloon night}
<A>__{a handsomely appointed saloon. at a corner table, the pot is so rich 2 players have folded leaving ed bailey, a big, sullen, tough looking gambler, facing gaunt, elegant doc holliday. full of southern refinement and languid, almost feline grace. doc has such unerring style and aplomb that he makes his constant tubercular coughing sound as if he's merely clearing his throat. bailey leans forward, seething with impatience:}
<C>__{bailey}
<D>__{i said that's 500 to you, holliday. in or out?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{500? sly boots, must be a peach of a hand.}
<A>__{kate horony, doc's voluptuous hungarian consort enters, refilling his engraved silver stirrup cup. she has a faint accent:}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{here, doc.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{bless you, darling}
<P>__{(puts arm around her)}
<D>__{darling! are you mad? you're not wearing a bustle. how lewd!}
<C>__{bailey}
<D>__{oh, for christ's sake!}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{ed bailey, you look like you're just ready to burst. well call me a fool but i guess i will just have to call. cover your ears, darling.}
<A>__{doc covers the bet and shows his hand. bailey pounds the table.}
<C>__{bailey}
<D>__{god damn son of a...}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{isn't that a daisy?}
<C>__{bailey}
<D>__{just pick up your money and go. sick of listening to you simper.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{now ed, are we cross?}
<A>__{doc leans forward, revealing an ivory gun butt under his coat.}
<C>__{bailey}
<D>__{skinny lunger, your guns don't impress me. wasn't for those guns you'd be nothin'.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{why ed, what an ugly thing to say! does this mean you're not my friend anymore? you know, ed, if i thought you weren't my friend i don't think i could bear it.}
<A>__{now a cheshire cat smile we will soon come to know very well steals over doc's face as he takes out his nickel plated .38 colt lightning and .45 peacemaker and lays them on the table.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{there, now we can be friends again. but remember, ed, friendship is trust so please don't hurt me.}
<A>__{doc bats his eyelashes. bailey jumps up, boiling. a long, sweaty moment, then bailey lunges. doc spring up, grabbing him by the hair and jabbing his fist into bailey's armpit. bailey screams and doubles over. doc gives him two more blows, so light they hardly seem capable of the effect they're having. but as he turns to give him another we suddenly see that there's a knife in doc's hand. the bartender reaches for the shotgun under the bar. kate pulls a derringer from her muff and puts it to his ear.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{touch that gun, i burn you down!}
<A>__{he backs off. kate covers the room. bailey drops to his knees.}
<C>__{bailey}
<D>__{oh, my god...}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{does it hurt? a lot? good.}
<A>__{eyes gleaming cruelly, doc blows his cigarette smoke into bailey's face. bailey sinks to the floor in a fetal position. kate gathers up the pot as doc retrieves his guns, looking around the room. then both back up to the door.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{well, good evening then.}
<A>__{they exit. the others look down at the groaning bailey lying in a pool of his own blood. a gambler shakes his head:}
<D>__{1st gambler judas...}
