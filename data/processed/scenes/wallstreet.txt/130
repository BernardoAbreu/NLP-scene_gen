<L>__{interior bud's condo night}
<A>__{bud is in silk boxers on the phone, number crunching on the computer, foot pounding to a music beat on the stereo, while his telex spews out overnight currency data. darien in the background lies in bed in panties reading vogue.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(into the phone)}
<D>__{buy me 20 june euro dollar cds. twenty march gold and sell 10 september deutsch marks. that's right...}
<A>__{he hangs up, back to the computer a growing look of excitement and revelation in his eyes. on the computer screen we see a break up of bluestar airlines its assets and liabilities. bud hits the command key, printing it out. he's exuberant.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{bud, i hate to tell you this but you're a genius!}
<P>__{(to darien)}
<D>__{darien...lightning has struck! the lightbulb has been invented. edison, da vinci, einstein are watching...}
<C>__{darien}
<P>__{(grumpy)}
<D>__{...are you going to trade all night again? you got to go to work in a couple of hours.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{you think i'm gonna broker the rest of my life... i'm going to be a giant, darien, an entrepreneur in the italian 15th century sense of the word a mover, shaker.}
<A>__{bud dances over to the bed turning the stereo down on his way.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i love you, baby. did i tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?}
<C>__{darien}
<D>__{get in bed. y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? you're turning into a yuppie frankenstein, you love money so much.}
<A>__{bud grabs a bottle of ferrier off the night table and drinks.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. i never had it like you when i was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side.}
<C>__{darien}
<D>__{you're so naive bud, you don't even know. your dad took care of you. i might've been rich when i was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. he was a lousy gambler...}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(teasing)}
<D>__{...that changes all my plans, i thought you were loaded...}
<C>__{darien}
<P>__{(laughs woefully)}
<D>__{so did i, till i hit 19 and found i had all the royal habits and no throne. mom got by but i had to go to work just like you. only the skills i had were shopping and making friends. so...that's why i do what i do, what makes you tick, buddy?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{fear. the fear of being poor i guess, just like you, darien... but that's all gonna change sweetheart. i'm catching the express...}
<P>__{(making love to her)}
<D>__{... and you're going along for the ride.}
