<A>__{tires screech as cars tear out of the driveway. walter stands at a bus stop across the street. as vicki walks across the lot, a car pulls up next to her and men catcall and whistle out the window. vicki flicks them off. the men burst into hysterics and peal out of the lot. she gets in her jeep and leaves, tearing by the bus stop. walter looks after her then turns his collar up against the chill. it is late winter. the trees are bare black silhouettes against the darkening sky. walter turns towards the shelter for protection from the wind. filling the kiosk, a clothing advertisement displays a young girl striking a seductive pose.}
