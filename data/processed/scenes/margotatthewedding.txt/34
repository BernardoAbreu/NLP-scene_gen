<L>__{interior claude's guest room evening}
<A>__{claude sits on the bed. the record sleeve from blondie's "parallel lines" rests in his lap. he reads the lyrics to the song, "sunday girl." he depresses the red record button on an old portable tape recorder. he sings a cappella and full voice, passionately, as sweetly as he can. maisy appears in the doorway and watches. claude turns mid lyric. he jumps, startled.}
<C>__{maisy}
<D>__{singing?}
<A>__{fumbling, claude shuts off the tape recorder.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{hm? a bit.}
<A>__{she drifts into the room and hovers closely above claude who remains on the bed. margot passes by in the hallway, disheveled from her escape. she watches: maisy takes the lyric sleeve from claude's hands. her t shirt hangs above her waist showing her smooth stomach.}
