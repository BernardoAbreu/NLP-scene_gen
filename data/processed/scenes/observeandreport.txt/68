<B>__{day}
<A>__{sprint: the testing officer blows a whistle and starts the 100 meter dash. ronnie jumps off the starting line and hauls ass down the track. the other trainees fall behind ronnie as he smokes their asses. pull ups: ronnie jumps on the bar and begins to do pull up after pull up. side slide: the testing officer blows a whistle and ronnie begins to shuffle side to side like an ice skater that never moves forward. sit ups: ronnie goes hard on the sit ups. obstacle course: ronnie sprints up a wall and flips to the other side. he charges a body of water, then jumps onto the rope and swings safely to the other side.}
