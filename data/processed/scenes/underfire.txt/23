<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior the viking club of managua night}
<A>__{corrugated metal roofs, thatched hut booths, a strange combination of decorative and architectural devices. daisy williams, a large black woman from nicaragua, sings "i left my heart in san francisco" with a mediocre jazz group. hub kittle is present, and other journalists drop by the table to say hello. a boy photographer, 13, aims an ancient bellows type polaroid at a booth in which claire sits between alex and price. they are holding a pose indefinitely while the boy struggles with the camera. they hold up the time cover and a couple of beers in celebration, and when he finally snaps the picture no flash. the boy puts the camera down disappointedly.}
<C>__{boy photographer}
<P>__{(in broken english)}
<D>__{sometimes it doesn't work.}
<A>__{the three journalists relax their pose.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{let me look.}
<A>__{on the bandstand daisy has just finished "san francisco" and spots alex, motioning to him.}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{ladeez and gen'mun, hep me get aaleex ov' here...}
<A>__{daisy applauds lightly for alex to join them. alex is equally pleased and embarrassed.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{there's not many piano bars left where i'm still welcome.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{if she can't sing in the key of c i'm in trouble.}
<A>__{alex excuses himself and joins daisy on the bandstand. price and claire are left alone in the booth as price hands the repaired camera back to the boy. alex at the piano begins a slow, easy cocktail version of "stardust," the song of his generation perhaps, and he seems happy, seduced by his own chords. price and claire resume their pose, and this time the camera flashes. price pays for the picture from the boy. at first there is a moment of awkwardness between them.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{well...}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{"well"... you finished your assignment in chad?}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{got africa all wrapped up and pouched to my editor.}
<A>__{she smiles and relaxes a bit at the typical price remark.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{you're going to love this war, russell... there's good guys, bad guys, cheap shrimp...}
<P>__{(an afterthought)}
<D>__{and alex is still singing in the background.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i missed you.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{we gotta get alone somewhere to talk.}
<A>__{alex begins singing as he plays. he sings like a trumpet player no voice but great phrasing. he half smiles as he sings, enjoying the song and enjoying making them uncomfortable.}
<B>__{alex at the piano}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{sometimes i wonder why i spend these lonely nights, dreaming of a song...}
<B>__{back at the booth}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{jesus... he's doing it on purpose.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{alex is one of the world's leading experts on military strategy.}
<A>__{they don't really want to talk about alex though his presence is unavoidable. price changes gears, gets slightly goofy, and steers the conversation to more comfortable turf.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{well, hell, i just got off the boat... gimme the scoop on nicaragua...}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{well... about sixty years ago the u.s. marines invaded to protect american business interests and put down a peasant revolt led by a little man who wore a giant cowboy hat his name was augusto sandino... in nineteen thirty four he was murdered at a peace conference, and the somoza family has ruled ever since...}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{no, no, no... i don't mean the stuff about the peasants i mean the real stuff.}
<A>__{she knows what he means, but she wants to tease him a bit first.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{the "real" stuff?... you mean a history of class struggle in agrarian societies?}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{no, c'mon!}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{oh. okay... well...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{just a couple things.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{one there's only two kinds of beer available tona and victoria. victoria's better.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and two if you see miss panama hanging around the hotel bar hot, hot, hot but don't touch. she belongs to tacho, and if anybody gets caught with her then el presidente has promised to personally cut off the guy's...}
<P>__{(unsure which word to use)}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{pecker?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{yeah... and throw it into lake managua.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{jesus.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{and the lake's already polluted.}
<A>__{price is impressed, and yet another new face drops by the booth they both recognize and see him coming, a contemporary of price, regis flynn, a scraggly british journalist who heads over to their table holding three beers.}
<C>__{price}
<P>__{(mutters to claire)}
<D>__{is there anybody here we don't know?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{regis slides into their booth, happy to see them.}
<C>__{regis}
<D>__{g'damn, price... kudos on the african snaps.}
<P>__{(shakes hands, a}
<D>__{perfunctory kiss on}
<P>__{her cheek)}
