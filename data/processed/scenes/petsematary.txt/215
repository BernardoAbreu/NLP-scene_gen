<D>__{you'll understand. in the meantime, keep your peace. what we did, louis, was a secret thing. women are supposed to be the ones who are good at keeping secrets, but any woman who knows anything at all would tell you she's never seen into a man's heart. the soil of a man's heart is stonier, louis like the soil up there in the old micmac burying ground. a man grows what he can...and tends it.}
<A>__{during this, he's come across the room to louis and dropped his hand on louis's shoulder.}

<D>__{but }
<C>__{jud}
<D>__{no buts! accept what's done, louis. what we done was right. another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least i hope to christ it was. now you make your call...but not a word about tonight.}
