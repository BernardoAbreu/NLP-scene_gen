<C>__{mc}
<D>__{miss rivas... yes... how would you solve our country's present economic problems?}
<C>__{laverne}
<D>__{who, me?}
<C>__{mc}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{laverne}
<D>__{that's a good question. from the way i understand it, according to supply side economics, when supply exceeds demand, recession is the result. that's why i think we should control the credit markets and increase the prime rate. that way, the consumer price index will stabilize and we will have economic recovery.}
<A>__{angle the crowd they break into spontaneous applause. angle chulo he is totally blown away. angle laverne she smiles broadly at the applause and walks off stage. chulo moves alongside her.}
