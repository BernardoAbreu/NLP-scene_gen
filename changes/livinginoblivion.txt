<ACTION>__{A battered 35mm movie camera stands alone on a wooden tripod surrounded by blackness. Opening credits begin. An almost imperceptible DOLLY in toward the movie camera. The dolly forward continues throughout the credits ending in an EXTREME CU of the camera's lens, filling the frame like a giant, glass full moon. Fade to BLACK. Suddenly a door opens directly in front of the camera, wiping the lens and revealing the following scene in Black and White.}

In the weak light filtering out of their battered van, BERT and CYBIL -- the Craft Service Managers, finish setting out breakfast supplies on a 6' table. They work in almost complete silence, both nearly paralyzed with sleep. A cheap walkie- talkie, lying beside a paper plate of soggy Oreos, sputters and buzzes occasionally. Other items on the table include a mangled banana, seven grapes, and a box of chocolate covered donuts.}

<ACTION>__{The camera is wide, showing the entire set, actors, and crew. Everyone stands in perfect silence, as motionless as statues. As the silence continues the mood on the set gradually changes. One by one people drift into their own private worlds of reflection. MS the Sound man, alternately watching his recorder and his stopwatch. Behind him the Boom man holds the mike in position to record general ambiance while staring off into the distance. CU the tape recorder spinning in quiet precision. CU the stopwatch, its giant second hand showing five seconds have passed. MS Nick standing next to his mother who drapes one arm casually over Nick's shoulder. Nick glances up and sees Nicole beside him, absorbed in her own thoughts. Suddenly she looks up and her eyes meet Nick's. She slips him the barest hint of a smile. The camera DOLLIES slowly through the standing, silent group, passing over faces in different degrees of thought. CU the Sound man's stopwatch, the giant second hand showing ten seconds have passed. MS Nick. He is so immersed in thought he looks at no one. The camera slowly DOLLIES into a CU of him.}
