<C>__{makepeace}
<D>__{and the lord shall smite them! yea, harken to me. the theatres are handmaidens of the devil! under the name of the curtain, the players breed lewdness in your wives, rebellion in your servants, idleness in your apprentices and wickedness in your children! and the rose smells thusly rank by any name! i say a plague on both their houses!}
