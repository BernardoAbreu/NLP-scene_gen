<L>__{interior room}
<A>__{ted finds himself alone with angela. they lock eyes. angela implores ted to lean forward. ted sizes up the situation: his chances of making it to the door are slim due to the fact that he would have to pass by the bathroom door. ted paces back and forth in front of angela, who struggles to get his attention. he whips around and they face off in what appears to be a game of charades. ted finally gets the point and cautiously removes the gag from angela's mouth. angela spits an old sock out.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{what!}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{we don't have time to play charades here, asshole! untie me quick.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{listen, lady, i don't know what in the hell is going on here, but i'd appreciate it if you would explain to that nutcase that he's making a big mistake.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{look, whether you like it or not, you're in the middle of a situation here you can't just wish your way out of.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{but i've never seen you people before, we're complete strangers.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{everyone starts out strangers, ted, it's where we end up that counts. hurry up.}
<A>__{ted wrestles with the idea of whether to untie angela or not.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i don't know if i can do this. it's too hard.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{life is hard, ted. you ever stopped to consider how many times you change your underwear in a lifetime?}
<A>__{on nervous impulse, ted begins the calculations.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{i don't mean literally, you ignoramus.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{forget it, listen to me. there's a gun in my suitcase behind the bed, it's loaded...}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i'm not going to shoot anybody.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{fine. get the gun and i will shoot "anybody."}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{and make me an accessory in the murder of your husband?}
<A>__{ted collapses to his knees in front of angela.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{that's not fair. it just isn't fair.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{get a fucking grip on yourself. first off, who says he's my husband? and second, we are a long way from fair here, fair is back in jolly old england eatin' crumpets and sipping on tea.}
<A>__{ted collects himself.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{tut. tut. tut. not so fast. well, maybe there are two sides to this thing.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{there are two sides to a plate, still you only eat off of one. now get the gun!}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{so why's he got you tied up?}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{i'm a werewolf, ted! get the gun!}
<A>__{ted is at a loss as to what to do. angela turns on the charm.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{come on, ted. come over here just for a minute. you can do it. come on, ted. you look like a good guy.}
<A>__{ted creeps towards her.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{that's it, teddy. you look so much more attractive when you're self assured.}
<A>__{sigfried suddenly comes to life... he's heard from the bathroom belting out "life is but a dream... she boom, she boom."}
<C>__{angela}
<P>__{(she panics)}
<D>__{quick, he's coming back. put the gag back in, and remember the gun!}
<A>__{ted hurries to replace the sock in her mouth.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{nine thousand, three hundred and twenty two times, to the best of my estimation.}
