<L>__{interior warehouse night}
<A>__{jensen and pooch sitting at a table. both with laptops. jensen tapping his keys. roque enters, carrying a coffee. stops short, seeing the others. surprised.}
<C>__{roque}
<D>__{thought you guys'd be back at the hotel.}

<D>__{couldn't sleep.}
<C>__{roque}
<D>__{me neither. grabbed a coffee from the machine you want one?}
<A>__{he slides into a chair.}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{no thanks.}
<C>__{jensen}
<D>__{you won't believe how detailed these files are. every goliath executive they've ever insured, their policies, their payouts }
<C>__{roque}
<D>__{life insurance?}
<C>__{jensen}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{roque}
<D>__{what's the biggest payout?}
<C>__{jensen}
<P>__{(still typing)}
<D>__{gotta be wrongful death...}
<C>__{roque}
<D>__{pretty much what we're gonna be risking.}
<P>__{(to pooch)}
<D>__{what are you doing up?}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{jensen hacked a satellite for me earlier.}
<C>__{roque}
<D>__{the hell you need a satellite for?}
<A>__{pooch shows him the screen of his computer recorded video from earlier in the day. an overhead view of a playground pooch's daughters playing. they both watch for a bit. the only sound, jensen's typing. then:}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{when we first went over in 2001, jolene and my oldest tina wanted to do the yellow ribbon thing, right? only problem was there was no yellow ribbon to be found all the stores had been cleaned out.}
<C>__{roque}
<D>__{military neighborhood...}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{no doubt. and tina's four at the time, and what she can't understand is why the ribbon's gotta be yellow. so jolene sings her the song, right? to show her where the idea comes from. and when she's all done, tina, four years old, looks my wife dead in her eye and says "that's the dumbest song i ever heard."}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{so my wife and my four year old ended up tying a frilly purple ribbon round the old oak tree in our yard to bring daddy home...}
<C>__{roque}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{thought that counts, right?}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{yeah...}
