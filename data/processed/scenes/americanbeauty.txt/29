<A>__{we're at a high school basketball game. teenage boys play a fast and furious game. one team wearing pale blue and white uniforms scores a basket. perky cheerleaders jump up and down as the crowd goes wild. seated in the bleachers, next to the high school band, is a group of about twenty teenage girls, dressed in pale blue and white uniforms. among them, jane sits next to angela hayes. at sixteen, angela is strikingly beautiful; with perfect even features, blonde hair and a nubile young body, she's the archetypal american dream girl. jane stands and scans the bleachers.}
