<A>__{sam opens the door. he hears the sound of running water. he walks across the room and into the bathroom.}
<L>__{interior bathroom same}
<A>__{clouded mirrors, a shower stall full of. steam. behind the glass door we see an indistinct shape, moving about in the hot water. sam opens the shower door. the steam clears to reveal barbara's gorgeous athletic body.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{it's hot in here, just the way you like it.}
<A>__{she grabs his shirt, pulling him into the shower's flow. they kiss. she pulls his shirt open, loosens his pants. his clothes fall away. sam pushes her up against the tile wall, hard. she holds to his shoulders, nails sinking into his flesh, wrapping her legs around his hips as... the water, dark with swamp mud, spirals down the drain.}
