<L>__{interior emily's house afternoon}
<A>__{ben stands awkwardly for a moment, taking in the room and the people in it. he then walks over to emily who is standing at the table. he goes to shake her hand.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{how are you, emily?}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{well, thank you, mr. ben, sir. eh, that's father masonwane, our priest, and that's margaret from next door.}
<A>__{ben nods at them. stanley sits himself down.}
<C>__{stanley}
<P>__{(raising his hand in greeting)}
<D>__{mfundisi...}
<P>__{(priest)}
<D>__{... sisi!}
<P>__{(sister)}
<C>__{emily}
<P>__{(to ben)}
<D>__{please sit down. take this chair, the other one is broken.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(apologetically)}
<D>__{i didn't mean to disturb you. i've come to talk to you.}
<C>__{emily}
<P>__{(as she sits on the broken chair)}
<D>__{yes, it's good. what i want to know is why did they kill him. he didn't do them nothing. you know, mr. ben, sir, i washed his whole body for he was my husband. and i know a man who killed himself, he doesn't look like that.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{master, you must understand she's still raw inside.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i'm sure.}
<A>__{robert walks in, looks at ben and walks into his bedroom to fetch something, then as he's about to go out:}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{robert, where are you manners today? don't you greet visitors?}
<A>__{robert stops momentarily and looks at ben with hostility and hurries out of the room banging the door.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{i'm sorry for his rudeness.}
<C>__{priest}
<P>__{(to ben)}
<D>__{you have to understand what's happening to our children today, they're like wasps when you burn their nest.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{that's right. our children are saying 'that's enough!' things have to change in this country. they accuse us of being cowards.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{emily, i have really come to assure you that i will do all i can to help you find out what really happened to jonathan and your husband we cannot bring them back to life, but we can make sure that this sort of thing won't ever happen again.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{you mean well, sir, but it's better to forgive. if we keep the pain alive then hate and bitterness will remain with us.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{the air must be cleared. so we can breathe again.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{the air can only be cleared if we forget about yesterday's thunder.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{mr. ben is right. it's not that i want to go on with this thing because it's a bad thing that jonathan died, that gordon died that's hard enough to bear, but i can forgive it. but they covered gordon's name with dirt and we must clean it up, else he'll never have peace in his grave.}
<C>__{stanley}
<P>__{(to ben)}
<D>__{you must understand for us, suicide is a coward's way out, how do they say, it's a 'cop out.'}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{gordon wasn't a coward and we'll prove that. we have a very good advocate for the inquest. his name is de villiers. i have confidence in him and the truth will come out.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{the truth must be known. they killed my husband who wouldn't hurt a fly and they killed jonathan who was only a child...}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{those people who did it are sinful people who don't know what they're doing.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{he! mfundisi, what are you saying now? you mean...}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{we must help them. that's the only way. they need our help, not hate, but love.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{i pity them and i ask the lord to help me so i can learn to love them.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{if that's what you preach in your church you will soon be starving.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{they covered his name with dirt.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{aren't you afraid sis emily?}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{no. in the end one grows tired of being afraid.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{amen!}
<A>__{ben has been listening to the discussion with interest, this being the first time he has heard africans talking seriously about their problems.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{emily, stanley and i will do all we can. as i said we have a good advocate. everyone involved with gordon's death will be questioned and all that's known regarding what happened in john vorster square will come out.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{how can anything come out of that john vorster square? who there will say: 'yes, we killed the boy and gordon?'}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{lawyers ask questions.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{and don't policemen lie?}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{thank you, mr. ben, sir for what you're doing.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(standing)}
<D>__{i'm pleased i came.}
<C>__{stanley}
<P>__{(to ben as he goes to the door)}
<D>__{wait, let me check the situation.}
<A>__{he opens the door and walks out.}
