<L>__{interior dwight's attic}
<A>__{dwight and toby are looking for something. they both shine flashlights around the dark attic, illuminating old magazines, dolls, etc. dwight says, "i know i put 'em up here somewhere." then toby's flashlight lands on the unusual tub with the four blue stars which had held the beaver. forgotten all this time, the beaver has transmogrified into a weird, two foot high pile of what looks like cotton candy. and, hideously enough, the cloud like stuff is still in the shape of the beaver. then dwight says, "shit the roof must've leaked on 'em." toby turns to where dwight shines his flashlight on the ten boxes of chestnuts. also forgotten, the chestnuts are covered with mold, too but a different kind: this is wet, slick looking stuff that rises off the chestnuts like dough in a breadpan. a spasm of rage crosses toby's face, and he turns and bangs out of the attic.}
