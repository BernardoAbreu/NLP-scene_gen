<A>__{buffy pulls herself up through a trap door in the corner. everything stops. for a moment there is silence. buffy gets shakily up.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{don't let her in! don't let her in!}
<A>__{pike and the others see her. pike and andy run to her to help.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{they'll kill us! get her out!}
<A>__{gary murray stops in front of kimberly, takes her face in his hand and lightly pops the back of her head against the wall. cross eyed, she slides back down into comatic silence.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{get away from me!}
<A>__{she pushes them away. lothos crashes through the trap door behind her, ugly and crazed. he picks her up, floating a good two feet off the ground.}
<C>__{lothos}
<D>__{you bitch!}
<A>__{he hurls her the length of the room. she hits a locker, which opens, spilling out someone's notebook. the binder falls open, inside it is a plastic pen case with pens and pencils within. buffy looks, by this time, like shit. she props herself up as best she can, looks about her. there is nothing wooden, nothing sharp, within reach.}
<C>__{lothos}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you would challenge me?}
<A>__{andy charges lothos from behind. pike tries to stop him, but is too late, as lothos grabs him by the face without even looking at him.}
<C>__{lothos}
<P>__{(continuing; to buffy)}
<D>__{i will rip the flesh from your stinking bones!}
<A>__{squeeze andy's head until we hear something crack. lets him drop. looks around at the cowed students.}
<C>__{lothos}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i am a god! a god!}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{i am so sure.}
<A>__{lothos roars. furious, he charges buffy, his feet just skimming the ground, racing toward her, violently fast, upon her... she spins, on her feet in a flash, one quick motion. she thrusts her palm forward and stops him, cold, like superman stopping a train, palm at his chest. silence. buffy looks directly into his eyes, the mad rictus of his face. lothos stops, almost wide eyed, as he looks down at his chest. sticking out of the middle of his chest is a small eraser, and a #2. he steps back, staring at buffy. the expression on his horrible face seems to have changed to one almost of respect. her look is unfathomable. lothos smiles, graciously.}
<C>__{lothos}
<D>__{it doesn't... hurt... as much as i had imagined.}
<A>__{he falls gently to the ground. he's dust before he hits it. silence. one by one the vampires, stricken, slip out into the night. angle pike kneeling by andy's body. he gets up, and walks toward what's left of lothos, warily keeping his eye on the spot. in the background we see gary murray, running out after a vampire.}
<C>__{gary murray}
<D>__{just a minute, you! i'm not finished with you!}
<A>__{pike kneels by the pile of dust with a pencil in it. everybody is looking at buffy. she stares back at the students who cast her out. turns and walks out. pike follows her.}
