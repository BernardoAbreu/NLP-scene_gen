<L>__{interior trash bag day}
<A>__{darkness. out of it we hear the voices of z and bala.}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{come on, z.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{forget it. you go ahead, i give up. i...i don't know what i was thinking. "insectopia".}
<A>__{in one corner of the screen, we can see an irregular little hole through which a shaft of light is falling. bala proceeds towards it, the hole appears to get bigger and bigger...}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(defeated)}
<D>__{there's only one thing worse than an ant who goes around mindlessly following orders, and that's an ant who's too dumb to go around mindlessly following orders.}
<A>__{bala stops...she notices that they're being watched. she's emerging from a tied off garbage bag the yellow ties loop away gracefully. bala and z have been tossed into a garbage area. and above them and below them, peering from garbage cans, recycling containers, bags, etc., a multi cultural assortment of insects are regarding them. a laid back fly voices their thoughts.}
<C>__{fly}
<D>__{what's with the bummer attitude?}
<A>__{a nearby butterfly joins in.}
<C>__{butterfly}
<D>__{yeah nobody stresses out ininsectopia!}
<C>__{bala}
<D>__{did you say...}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(joining bala)}
<D>__{...insectopia?}
<A>__{z and bala look around. just to get things straight, the garbage dump doesn't look disgusting that would be seeing it through human eyes. instead, we're looking at it throughant eyes and, reimagined this way, it's paradise. not the ordered, sterile, paradise of the picnic, but an earthly land of plenty. the sides of the plastic garbage bags are sheer, reflective walls of smoothest obsidian...the garbage cans are gigantic, thick metal columns put there by the gods (think the pyramids); a coke bottle, refracting the sunlight into a gorgeous rainbow, trickles a fountain of sweet nectar into the pink, bittersweet flesh of a grapefruit half, which appears as a multi chambered concave dome. everywhere, insects are disporting themselves a multi species love in that's like an insect version of woodstock. bala and z are awe struck. bala turns to z.}
<C>__{bala}
<P>__{(happily)}
<D>__{z, we made it!}
<C>__{fly}
<P>__{(alighting on the grapefruit)}
<D>__{c'mon in! the nectar's fine!}
<A>__{like a kid at an amusement park, z slides down the smooth side of the garbage bag, whooshing this way and that until he slides into one end of a straw (a red and white striped tunnel), and is shot out...}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{yippeeeeee!}
<A>__{...into a bottle cap filled with lemonade, which he alternately drinks and swims through... down at the bottlecap, z is drying himself off. then he sees, emerging from behind a lemon peel, a gigantic termite.}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(terrified)}
<D>__{aaaaagh!!!}
<A>__{surprisingly, the termite seems equally terrified...}
<C>__{fly}
<P>__{(to z)}
<D>__{hey, take it easy! there's nothin' to be afraid of!}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{yeah, well, i make it a practice not to trust anyone who shoots acid out of their forehead.}
<C>__{cricket}
<D>__{dude, here in insectopia, we don't judge people by how many arms and legs we've got.}
<C>__{fly}
<D>__{yeah, back home, they called me a fruitfly. but here, i'm known as...}
<P>__{(with attitude)}
<D>__{superfly.}
<C>__{cricket}
<D>__{anyway, big gus is mellow.}
<A>__{the termite sticks his hand out. a drop of acid drips from his head and splashes at z's feet.}
<C>__{z}
<P>__{(taking his hand, disgusted)}
<D>__{charmed.}
<A>__{z reaches out and shakes the termite's hand, as bala watches, smiling.}
