<A>__{everyone turns to look, but hull's view is blocked.}
<P>__{13 year old dealer (o.s.)}

<D>__{too fuckin' late.}
<A>__{popping noises. ivy is waving an automatic weapon. everyone on the street but hull has hit the ground.}

<P>__{(enjoying it, shouting)}
<D>__{get down, motherfuckers!}
<A>__{ivy laughs and fondles a girlfriend as the car roars off. he sees hull, pretends to fire, laughs as hull, too, ducks. when ivy's gone, he runs to where a crowd has gathered around... the 13 year old lying in the street, a bullet hole in his head, eyes open. he twitches and kicks, blood pulsing from the neat wound. then he's dead. the faces around him (young, old, many races) watch with a variety of emotions.}
<C>__{crowd}
<D>__{who is he?... why'd they shoot him?... ivy did him, man... he's in the wrong fuckin' place... that poor boy... get his beeper...}
<A>__{cops push through to the body. as the crowd disperses, hull can't take his eyes off the boy. when he finally does, he sees eddie, drink in hand. their eyes meet, and eddie, a rapper, raises his eyebrows in brief acknowledgment of sorrow.}
