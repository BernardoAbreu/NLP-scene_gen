<D>__{dear god, i know i don't believe in you, but since i will be starting catholic school soon, i thought i should practice. let's see... what do i want? i want people to be nicer to each other. i want lisa to realize what a bitch she has been and feel really bad and apologize for how she hurt me and know how much i still love her. in spite of everything, i still want paul to win the election tomorrow, not that cunt tracy. i also want a really expensive pair of leather pants... and someday i want to be really good friends with madonna. love, tammy}
