<A>__{weaver looks unconvinced.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{you have to help me. please, weaver. think of all the things i've done for you!}

<C>__{z}
<P>__{(overjoyed)}
<D>__{thanks! i owe you!}
<A>__{z skips off and joins the column, marching in time with the soldiers but too excited to keep from jazzing it up a little.}
