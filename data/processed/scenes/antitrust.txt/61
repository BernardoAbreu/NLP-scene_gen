<A>__{we find him, in an illuminated phone booth.}
<C>__{teddy }
<D>__{i've been hacking for five night's straight, i'm really making headway.}
<L>__{intercut with: interior teddy's loft (sunnyvale) continuous}
<A>__{a funky space, posters on the wall, a red stanford pennant, rubber trees at either end of his desk.}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{but these, like, white supremacists trashed my office, last week.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{what?!}
<A>__{on the wall beyond teddy the word gook (in blood red) has been covered over with paint but still bleeds through.}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{they're in the neighborhood. they usually hassle vietnamese grocers.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{jesus, teddy.}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{i'm cool. they didn't touch the machine. or my disks. probably didn't know what they were. so, you a moonie yet?}
<P>__{(he waits)}

<C>__{milo}
<D>__{no! i keep thinking it'll go away. but there's this connection. she's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. plus i see her every day, we're working on the same program. she's beautiful.}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{a beautiful geek? i don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{what d'you mean?}
<C>__{teddy}
<D>__{i dunno. i guess larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{teddy}
