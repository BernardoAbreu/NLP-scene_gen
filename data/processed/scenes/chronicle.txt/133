<T>__{violent distortion and crash to black:}
<B>__{from secure room video feed}
<L>__{interior hospital room}
<A>__{the camera is color, with crackly, strange, somewhat distorted audio. the image is a little blown out. andrew on a bed. his entire right side is absolutely scorched; the flesh looks like bloody, cracked paper, blackened and red. the parts of him that are bandaged are already soaked through with blood. he is barely breathing, hooked up to various machines. andrew is not going anywhere anytime soon. this is ensured by the handcuff on his left wrist. the machines beep. andrew doesn't move. the door opens, and mr. detmer enters, speaking to a police detective on the other side of the door.}
<C>__{mr. detmer}
<D>__{ come down to the city, cause his mother's all alone right now. she's got ms, i had to leave her at the house all a fucking alone.}
<C>__{police detective}
<D>__{i understand, mr. detmer.}
<C>__{mr. detmer}
<D>__{shit. jesus, look at this. can i have a moment with my son.}
<C>__{police detective}
<D>__{yeah i i will be outside the door, yeah?}
<C>__{mr. detmer}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{the officer closes the door, and mr. detmer goes and sits down in a chair next to the bed. he sits there staring at andrew, clearly horrified and upset, and buries his head in his hands. we speed up the recording, and detmer just sits like that. after five minutes of speed up, we slow down.}
<C>__{mr. detmer }
<D>__{i want you to apologize to me.}
<A>__{andrew is comatose.}
<C>__{mr. detmer }
<D>__{i said i want you to apologize to me. i know you can hear me. so i want you to sit up and apologize to me. i want you to stop this bullshit right now.}
<A>__{andrew is comatose.}
<C>__{mr. detmer }
<D>__{do you know how much this shit is going to cost me? do you know what you've done to your family?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you don't even care, do you? you just don't give a fuck, you've got your fucking morphine, don't you.}
<A>__{there's a beat, and then detmer suddenly slaps andrew's burnt shoulder. andrew flinches badly, and his pulse speeds up on the monitor.}
<C>__{mr. detmer }
<D>__{stop it. i'm not buying this shit, you can't just play this off like a fucking}
<P>__{(slap)}
<D>__{game, this is real. you really fucked me, me and your mother you know that, you little}
<P>__{(slap)}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{andrew no longer flinches, but the slaps leave red, bleeding molten welts. detmer stands up, clearly upset, and takes a quick pace forward and back.}
<C>__{mr. detmer }
<D>__{goddamn it, goddamn it! }
<A>__{detmer goes to slap andrew again, and andrew's arm jerks up. mr. detmer floats is telekinetically lifted into the air. he hangs screaming and struggling for a moment, then becomes rigid. andrew spreads his fingers, and his father abruptly separates into all of his component parts. they stop moving, hanging lifeless, then drop to the ground in a bloody mess. andrew's eyes open, revealing black red eightball hemorrhages, and he seizes badly, letting out a scream of agony, and then another, tearing at his iv. the police detectives rush the room, reacting with horror to the gore that was andrew's father. they barely have time to scream out when andrew snaps his cuff free of the bed, and lets out an enormous concussive blast, blowing apart everything in the room including the camera.}
