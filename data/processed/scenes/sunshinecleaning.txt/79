<A>__{rose hands winston a canister of fancy corn and a business card. rays of the sun dart off the edges of the card in a style of a child's drawing. it reads, "sunshine cleaning."}

<C>__{rose}
<D>__{thought we'd put a positive spin on things. my son drew the design.}

<D>__{this is great but you guys should really get out there and market yourselves.}
<A>__{oscar plays with an extraction cleaner and accidently turns it on. winston gives him a nod that indicates that he should turn it off. he does.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{so, marketing? like...?}
<C>__{winston}
<D>__{funeral homes, property managers... what you really want is to get in with the insurance companies. they can throw you a ton of work.}
