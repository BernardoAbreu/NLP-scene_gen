<L>__{intercut with: interior wills' rooftop terrace morning}
<A>__{wills sits in his woolen robe, holding a portable phone. amused, he smiles into the morning sun }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{oh my god, i'm so sorry! wait. who is this?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{wills keane.}
<A>__{her heart stops. she sits up slowly, her body tensed.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{who did you think it was?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{my friend simon, actually. he always calls me the morning after to sort of... you know... sum everything up.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{and how would you sum it up, charlotte? turning twenty.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{kinda cool, kinda creepy. anyway, you wanna speak to my grandmother?}
<C>__{wills}
<P>__{(with a chuckle)}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<A>__{olivia, 30's, wills' jamaican cook and housekeeper, enters. plump, handsome, and perpetually amused, she carries a tray laden with continental breakfast and a new york times. wills mouths a greeting. she smiles back and sets the tray on a table.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i called because i'm going to be attending a benefit... a black and white ball.... and i'd like you to design a hat... for my date.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{really? wow. sounds fun. okay.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{it's a gift. i don't have her measurements, but she's about your size. what're you, a six?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{good then let's assume your hat size is also the same.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{but that doesn't necessarily }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{it's a risk we'll just have to take.}
<A>__{charlotte runs over to her sewing table, looking for a pen and paper. she finds paper, but no pen }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{her dress is a sheath... sleeveless, black. the hat must, of course, be black or white or both.}
<A>__{she finds a pen but it doesn't work. she grabs an eyeliner and uses that }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{any particular style?}
<C>__{wills}
<P>__{(sipping his coffee)}
<D>__{no, just plenty of it. how long will it take?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{a week or two.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{you have till thursday. i will need it here by seven o'clock. i'm at the pembroke on central park west and 76th.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{oh. wow. okay.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{what's your fee?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<P>__{(faltering)}
<D>__{i don't really have one. i usually just make them for friends.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{how's five hundred dollars?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{really? wow.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{charlotte?}
<A>__{his tone has abruptly shifted; it's intimately hushed. it both daunts and excites her }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{you say "wow" a lot.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{it has to stop. you're a woman now.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{bye.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{bye.}
<A>__{she clicks off the phone, wilts into a swoon on the bed, and breaks out laughing. wills, still holding the receiver, stares dreamily into the middle distance. he snaps to when olivia enters. her accent is as much queens as it is caribbean }
<C>__{olivia}
<D>__{see, now you got me worried.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{olivia}
<D>__{you slept alone last night. you must be sick or somethin'. you want me to call a doctor?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{thank you, no, i'm fine.}
<A>__{she throws him a sly, sidelong glance, then exits. wills laughs and contentedly sips his coffee. from the next scene, we hear the sound of squealing, laughing,}
<B>__{shouting children.}
