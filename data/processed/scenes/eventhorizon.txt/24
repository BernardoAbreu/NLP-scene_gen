<A>__{a high tech operating room. modular equipment. vertical tanks line the walls, each large enough to hold a human being: gravity couches. the crew stands before the gravity couches, almost nude, no room for modesty. starck catches cooper looking at her ass as she strips to her undergarments. cooper grins. she flips him off, not bothering to turn around.}
<C>__{cooper}
<D>__{is that an offer?}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{it is not.}
<A>__{miller disrobes. two service tags hang around his neck. he does not remove them. weir approaches him.}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{captain miller, i appreciate this opportunity...}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{doctor weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. we were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{i've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach neptune space.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.}
<A>__{weir nods, moves to an empty couch bearing his name, written on a piece of tape. peters watches him.}
<C>__{peters}
<D>__{first time in a grav couch?}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{she checks weir's couch, helps him climb in. weir keeps one eye on miller.}
<C>__{peters}
<P>__{(off of weir's glance)}
<D>__{don't worry about it. he's hard, but he's fair. you're lucky to be shipping out with him. he's one of the few captains in the service with experience in the outer reach.}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{he's been past mars?}
<C>__{peters}
<D>__{he served on the goliath.}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{wasn't that ship destroyed?}
<C>__{peters}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{they attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for titan. the shuttle's oh two tanks ruptured during the rescue, flooded both ships with pure oxygen. there was a spark and both ships were incinerated. the skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat. captain miller was able...}

<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{he doesn't like to talk about it.}
<A>__{dj swathes one of weir's arms with alcohol.}
<C>__{dj}
<D>__{you didn't eat anything in the past twelve hours?}
<A>__{weir shakes his head.}
<C>__{dj}
<D>__{when the ion drive fires, we'll be taking about 30 gees. without a tank, the force would liquefy your skeleton.}
<A>__{dj injects weir. the scientist winces.}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{i've seen the effect on mice.}
<A>__{the overhead lights change to red.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{five minutes.}
<A>__{dj hands him the breathing mask.}
<C>__{dj}
<D>__{put this on.}
<A>__{weir does. dj checks the fit.}
<C>__{peters}
<D>__{you'll be fine. you'll wake up and we'll be there. watch your fingers.}
<A>__{dj closes the tank. it begins to fill with green gel. weir's eyes grow large with fear and then the anaesthesia hits. his eyes close. his body draws into a fetal position.}
<C>__{dj}
<P>__{(checking the monitor)}
<D>__{heart rate decreasing... body temp dropping to 80... 70... 60... 50... 40 degrees fahrenheit. he's in stasis.}
