<A>__{grady enters a room swimming in basebail memorabilia. autographed baseballs abound, as well as photographs of famous big leaguers. in one somewhat dated photo a trim man in his forties (a younger walter gaskell) stands with pittsburgh pirate bill mazeroski at an old timers game. as sara eases the door shut, grady nods to a 1951 yankee's pennant hanging over the mantle.}

<C>__{sara}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{walter just got it back from the framer today.}
<A>__{sara takes grady's hand, drawing him away from the pennant and down onto the coat covered bed.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{you go first.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{all right. this morning }
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i'm pregnant.}
<A>__{a flash of laughter flutters from the living room below. grady starts to speak.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i'm sure.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{well. this is...surprising. does walter... ?}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i think walter would find this a little more than surprising.}
<A>__{grady nods, getting her drift, then roils onto his back.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{emily left me this morning.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{she's left before...}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{she's left the room before. she always came back.}
<A>__{sara nods. considers this.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{so. i guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? simple.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{simple.}
<A>__{grady and sara stare at the ceiling. sara sniffs the coat lying beneath her. miss sloviak's coat.}
<C>__{sara}

<D>__{my god, i wear the same scent as a transvestite. she is a transvestite, isn't: she?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{if she's not now, terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{has he asked to see the book yet?}
<C>__{grady}

<C>__{sara}
<D>__{and? are you going to tell him?}
<C>__{grady}

<C>__{sara}
<P>__{(distantly)}
<D>__{neither do 1.}
<A>__{grady starts to pull up, but his arm is underneath sara.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{sara, my arm. i'm stuck, honey.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i guess you're going to have to chew it off then.}
