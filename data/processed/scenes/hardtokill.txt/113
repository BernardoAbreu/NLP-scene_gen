<L>__{exterior balcony storm}
<A>__{rips a magazine from his pocket, slams it into the butt of his .45, reloading. he has it half raised when: ford appears right in his face, assault rifle leveled at storm's guts. storm strikes an instantaneous blow, sending the rifle flying. in one motion, he pinwheels ford over his head, sending him flying off the exterior balcony and crashing down into the oriental fountain below!}

<A>__{storm swings down to the ground. andy leaps into his arms, he breaks her fall and helps her alight safely. he reaches to ford in the fountain, rips the mask off his face. he recognizes the man.}

<D>__{i know this fuck. he's a cop!}
<A>__{front side of house storm and andy race into view, leap aboard the jeep, fire it up and fly.}
<B>__{two more masked men}
<A>__{appear running down the drive shotgun and assault rifle trained on storm and andy. they begin to fire. andy can't shoot and storm can't drive and shoot at the same time, so he does what is logical for him he keeps the pedal to the metal and chases them. bullets from the two men obliterate the jeep's windshield. buckshot riddles the vehicle everywhere. andy is on the floor of the jeep. storm is periodically ducking. he is bleeding we don't know from what or how bad and then blam! masked man #1's body is airborne. this makes #2 think... and run very fast.}
