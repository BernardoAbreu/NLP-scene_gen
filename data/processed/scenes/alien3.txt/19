<A>__{only her face is visible. another board. bam bam bam. then just her eyes. just before the last plank is put in place }

<A>__{he tosses it into the cell. ripley catches it. watches as the last of the light is covered over. bam bam...bam. she continues to stare at the once open wall as her eyes grow accustomed to the darkness. the little light creeping between the planks grows in intensity until it is soon enough to see what it is she has caught newt's doll's head. ripley looks around her cell actually a narrow space behind other cells, one wall curved out like a narrow slice crossways towards the edge of the pie. looks at the doll's head in her hand. a beat. she freaks out !}
