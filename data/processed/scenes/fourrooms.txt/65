<C>__{four rooms}
<A>__{angela sticks her key in the door, then stops when she sees something approaching. the look on her face combines strange awe and mild shock. almost floating ethereally, a mysterious blond bombshell, wearing diana's see through negligee and slippers, armed with elspeth's sword slung over her shoulder, wanders toward her. she is in a daze, perhaps lost or drunk.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{you okay, lady?}
<A>__{the bombshell looks up at her dizzily.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{i said you looking for someone?}

<D>__{uhhh... yes... my husband... i think. have you seen him?}
<A>__{angela and the girl have a strange moment as they connect through the eyes. having had enough emotional intensity tonight, angela breaks their eye contact.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{lady, i haven't seen anybody.}
<A>__{diana quietly says, "ohhh," as she drifts on down the hall in a daze. angela puts her hand to her temples before opening her hotel door. she does a double take on the hallway empty. she pauses a beat, then walks into her room. after the door closes, we hear sigfried on the other side.}
<C>__{sigfried}
<D>__{where the hell have you been?}
