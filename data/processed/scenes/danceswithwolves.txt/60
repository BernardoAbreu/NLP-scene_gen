<L>__{exterior sedgewick day}
<A>__{considerable time has passed. dunbar, bundled warmly against the chill of an oncoming storm, and cisco are coming back into camp from a hunting foray. a brace of grouse is slung over cisco's withers.}
<L>__{interior quarters day}
<A>__{it's storming outside. rain is pouring down, its patter broken from time to time by spectacular flashes of lightning and the boom of thunder. but inside it's cozy. the quarters are still crowded but considerable order has been brought to bear on the place. he is just finishing up the grouse and a pile of bones sits on the table. open at his side is his journal.}
<C>__{dunbar }
<D>__{almost a month and no one has come. the longer this condition persists, the less inclined i am to believe that anyone will. rain has forced me indoors for most of two days. i have begun an awning. the work has ruined my hands, but i am excited about the improvement it will bring to this place.}
<A>__{a great bolt of lightning strikes outside, filling the room with violent white light. dunbar walks to the door and tosses out a handful of bones. two socks scurries to collect the bones and retreats under the shelter of a nearby tree.}
<C>__{dunbar }
<D>__{it is the loneliest of times... but i cannot say that i am unhappy.}
