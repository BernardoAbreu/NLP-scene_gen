<L>__{interior steilacoom violent ward night}
<A>__{the ward is a huge room packed with nearly naked women, their hair cropped very short. the walls are corrugated tin nailed to bare wood framing. the place looks like an enormous tool shed. the sound of garbled voices and screaming never stops. these are the forgotten ones... beyond hope. everyone here has lost any notion of what they might have once been. their faces are slack, only their eyes glow with an animal ferocity. some wander aimlessly about, unheeding of others who are pushing, kicking and screaming at them. many squat in the dirt by the walls, mired in their own urine and excrement, chanting wordlessly to themselves. some appear lifeless, their prone bodies shoved out of the way. some women are involved in violent sex with themselves or each other, some in mindless fist fights. in a far corner we see a group of men in various military and medical uniforms, their backs to us, facing the wall, grouped around something. we hear their cheering and laughing and joking, slapping each other on the back. we slowly move closer and can see over their shoulders the object of their hilarity. it's frances, lying naked and spread eagled on the floor. four hospital attendants pin her arms and legs. a soldier, his pants down around his ankles, is squirming violently on top of her. frances' eyes are open but glazed, her face turned away from her attacker. she is passive and unresisting. she is reciting to herself, over and over.}

<D>__{soldier #1 ...best deal i ever made. twenty bucks to fuck a fuckin' movie star. soldier #2 yeah, it's worth it i guess. soldier #1 what's she saying, anyway? soldier #2 who knows. she's crazy, ain't she?}
