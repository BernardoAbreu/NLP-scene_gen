<L>__{interior first class cabin day}
<A>__{a sexy stewardess pours champagne for rick and ernie. the anarchist sits nearby with the bomb on his lap. rick winks suggestively at the stewardess. she walks off, obviously not interested. rick raises his glass to ernie, oozing sleazy confidence.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{in the bag.}
<A>__{the plane hits turbulence, and rick's drink flies up out of his glass he catches it as it comes down. another stewardess helps the anarchist put his bomb in the overhead compartment. ernie ogles her. she sneers at him. we hear the captain's voice on the loudspeaker.}
<C>__{captain }
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. to the right of the aircraft, you can see a great view of the grand canyon.}
<A>__{all the passengers crane their necks to the right.}
<C>__{captain }
<D>__{and to the left you can see a panic stricken little troll.}
<A>__{rick turns to his window and flings open the shade to reveal...}
<C>__{stuey}
<A>__{on the wing, pressing his face up against the glass. he's holding up a publicity shot of rick and screaming something we can't hear.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{ahhhhhhh!}
<A>__{stuey loses his grip and is whisked off the wing. rick watches him fall into oblivion. relieved, he turns nonchalantly to ernie, ignoring the other horrified passengers.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{you gonna eat your peanuts, ernie?}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{nah, you can have 'em.}
