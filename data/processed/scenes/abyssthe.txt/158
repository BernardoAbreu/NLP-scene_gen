<D>__{jesus, lindsey }
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{bud, something really important is happening here.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{look. i'm just trying to hold this situation together. i can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria }
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{who's hysterical? nobody's hysterical!}
<A>__{they're talking across each other, not connecting. bud weary and frustrated. lindsey is cranked up with the afterglow of her encounter.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{all i'm saying is when you're hanging on by your fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{i saw something! i'm not going to go back there and say i didn't see it when i did. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{god, you are the most stubborn woman i ever knew.}

<D>__{i need you to believe me, bud. look at me. do i seem stressed out? any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?}

<C>__{bud}
<D>__{how can i go on a feeling? you think coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{we all see what we want to see... coffey looks and he sees russians, he sees hate and fear. bud, you have to look with better eyes than that.}
<A>__{bud has been taking this all in. his eyes tracking her face. he closes his eyes, taking a deep breath. it's so hard for him to do this, but...}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i can't, lindsey. i'm sorry. how can i?}
