<L>__{exterior shopping mall day}
<A>__{the security guard tags shermin into the parking lot.}
<C>__{security guard}
<D>__{eyewitnesses are the worst. you get two of them together. you got three stories. you know what i mean?}
<A>__{shermin sees lyman come out of the crowd surrounding the police cars in front of the helicopter.}
<C>__{security guard}
<D>__{is there a reward in this?}
<C>__{shermin}
<D>__{huh?... eh... no, there isn't}
<C>__{security guard}
<D>__{because i'm the one who called the police, you know.}
<C>__{shermin}
<D>__{yeah, thanks. we appreciate that.}
<C>__{security guard}
<D>__{hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... you want my opinion, it's the girl. she had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.}
<C>__{shermin}
<D>__{you saw that?}
<C>__{security guard}
<D>__{hey... he didn't look like no big time criminal to me.}
<A>__{lyman meets them. it is obvious he has something to tell shermin.}
<C>__{security guard}
<D>__{eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... but that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?}
<C>__{shermin}
<D>__{i wouldn't think so.}
<C>__{security guard}
<P>__{(peeling off)}
<D>__{that's what i thought. so remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.}
<C>__{shermin}
<D>__{we will.}
<P>__{(he turns to lyman)}
<D>__{something's wrong here. she's helping him now.}
<C>__{lyman}
<P>__{(alarmed)}
<D>__{i know. she bought him a ticket for lathrop wells and put him on the bus. he didn't stay on though and they drove off together.}
<C>__{shermin}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{doesn't make sense.}
<C>__{lyman}
<D>__{maybe he's turned her into one of them. they enter the crowd around the helicopter.}
