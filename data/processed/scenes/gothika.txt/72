<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{oh god, oh god, oh god...}
<A>__{she rocks back and forth. finally aware of what she's done. she is the killer. no more doubts. and now that she knows, everything is much worse. a long, harrowing beat. we push in on her devastated face. night turns to day.}
<L>__{interior miranda's cell day}
<A>__{the locks are unlocked. pete appears at the door. miranda glances up at him. she looks like a different person. completely destroyed. he crouches beside her.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{she shakes her head slowly. he sets his hand on her shoulder. she turns to him and hugs him tight, holding on for dear life. breaks down in sobs.}
