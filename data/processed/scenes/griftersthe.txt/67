<L>__{interior sarber & webb day}
<A>__{a low rail separates the visitors from an area of desks with clerks typing or adding up figures or talking on the phone. beyond them are floor to ceiling bins and shelves with narrow aisles between, in which more clerks move busily, filling orders or doing inventory. a great sense of activity and hubbub. roy enters, looks around in surprise. a clerk at a front desk sees him, stands happily.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{roy! welcome back.}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(approaching him)}
<D>__{what's going on? this is usually coffee break time.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{not since kaggs showed up.}
<A>__{other clerks, aware of roy, come over with ad lib greetings.}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(happily basking)}
<D>__{hey, yeah, i'm fine, everything's great. what's this kaggs? sounds like a disease. 2nd clerk it is.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{troubleshooter from the main office. came out here right after you went into the hospital, and he ain't had a kind word for anybody yet. 3rd clerk nobody knows anything but him.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{he chopped off half a dozen salesmen; won't wholesale to them any more. 2nd clerk what kind of sense does that make? they're all on commission.}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(unworried)}
<D>__{you think he'll chop me?}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{if he does, he's crazy. 2nd clerk here he comes!}
<A>__{the clerks all hurry back to their desks as kaggs enters. he crosses to roy, hand stuck out.}
<C>__{kaggs}
<D>__{kaggs. home office.}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(taking his hand)}
<D>__{roy dillon.}
<C>__{kaggs}
<P>__{(keeping roy's hand)}
<D>__{i know that. knew it when i saw you out there. the best salesman here, which isn't saying much. want to talk to you, dillon.}
<A>__{kaggs moves toward the gate in the rail, still holding roy's hand, to move him along. roy stands still, which yanks kaggs back. kaggs frowns at him, releases his hand.}
<C>__{kaggs }
<D>__{what's up?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{that was a pretty backhanded compliment. if i let people get away with things like that, i wouldn't be a good salesman.}
<C>__{kaggs}
<P>__{(brisk)}
<D>__{you're right. i apologize. but i still want to talk to you.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{lead on.}
<A>__{kaggs leads the way through the rail.}
