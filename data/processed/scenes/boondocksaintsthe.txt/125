<L>__{interior yakavetta's house basement room night}
<A>__{murphy has scootched his chair in front of connor's. he has his back to connor. he stretches his neck over and bites at the collar of his p coat. he gathers as much of the material in his mouth as he can. he starts to yell, "do it!" but it is muffled. connor, still sobbing, begins to kick his brother's left hand repeatedly. he turns it into a bloody piece of broken meat as murphy screams through the shirt. finally, it is broken enough and murphy pulls it through the cuff. he stands and breaks the chair into pieces and grabs the sharpest piece. hojo enters and murphy shoves the sharp stick up through the bottom of his chin into his head. he drags him around the room yelling mumbo jumbo into his face as connor jumps up and down in his chair in rage, wanting a piece of the action. murphy throws the man down and connor proceeds to viciously kick his dead body. the two have turned into barbarians. murphy removes the man's two guns, shiny nickel plated 45s.}
