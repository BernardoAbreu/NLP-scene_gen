<D>__{hell of a fight, champ...}
<A>__{not only have we seen ali lose for the first time, not only do we see him bruised, but when a fighter's beaten, everybody who believes in him is beaten. angelo's cutting the tape off his hands. bundini places an ice pack on the back of his neck.}

<P>__{they stole it from you! (etc.)}
<A>__{bundini's wise enough to say nothing.}

<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{after three and a half years, this...from how far back...comeback is.}
