<L>__{129 med. shot willard, lance}
<A>__{they dash up the embankment and along the barbed wire on the edge of the road. shells scream overhead, they don't know where to run.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{straight ahead, son of a bitch.}
<A>__{they dive towards the voice.}
<L>__{130 close shot trench}
<A>__{they dive in, a soldier is crounched in f.g. holding his buddy who is crying uncontrollably.}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{you came right to it, son of a bitch }
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{son of a bitch, sir.}
<A>__{the soldier doesn't respond.}

<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{straight up the road a concrete bunker beverly hills where else you think he'd be?}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{c'mon }
<A>__{there is an apparent lull and they dash out along the road. suddenly to their right an m 60 starts opening up from a sandbagged emplacement.}
<C>__{soldier }
<D>__{get your asses down, buddy.}
<A>__{they drop and crawl to the slit trench and run up to the emplacement. several soldiers man a m 60. one has a sniper rifle another tries to spot for the gunner. willard and lance edge up along the trench. willard trips.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{watch your feet, asshole }
<A>__{willard looks down.}
<C>__{voice}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you stepped on my face.}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{we thought you were dead.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{the whole world loves a smart ass.}
<A>__{they move ahead more carefully. the gunner blasts away into the night, there is a pile of brass cases about three feet high next to him. finally he stops swearing to himself.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{what're you shooting at, soldier?}
<C>__{gunner}
<D>__{gooks.}
<A>__{he turns and sees it's an officer.}
<C>__{gunner}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i m sorry, sir.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{it's all right, sergeant what's out there?}
<C>__{gunner}
<D>__{they were tryin' to cut through the wire i got 'em all i think.}
<C>__{other soldier}
<D>__{oh yeah listen.}
<A>__{there is a low moaning scream from out in the wire it stops for aminute then continues hideously.}
<C>__{gunner}
<D>__{he's trying to call his friends send up a flare.}
<A>__{the spotter does, it arcs up, then bathes them in eerie light. the gunner fires a long burst.}
<C>__{spotter}
<D>__{those are all dead, stupid, he's obviously underneath 'em }
<A>__{they think about this as the flare goes out. the screaming gets more intense.}
<C>__{gunner}
<D>__{wake up the roach.}
<A>__{the spotter moves down to where a tall lanky soldier is leaned up against the trench. he kicks him hard several times. roach wakes and just looks up. on his helmet are the words: "god bless dow."}
<C>__{roach}
<D>__{yeah, man.}
<C>__{spotter}
<D>__{slope in the wire hear him.}
<A>__{he listens, he does, he nods.}
<C>__{spotter}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{bust him.}
<A>__{roach gets up somewhat annoyed but very cool. he saunters up the machine gun dragging his m 79 which has paisley designs all over it.}
<C>__{gunner}
<D>__{hear him?}
<C>__{roach}
<D>__{sure , yeah.}
<C>__{gunner}
<D>__{you need a flare }
<C>__{roach}
<D>__{no, it s cool.}
<A>__{he opens the breech of his shotgun like weapon and plunks the big slug into it. he snaps it closed then rests it across his forearm over the trench he listens to the scream, calculating.}
<C>__{roach}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{he's close real close.}
<A>__{he adjusts his sights so that the gun is aimed high into the air. he listens again then fires. the grenade whistles off into the night. there is a sharp explosion that cuts off the scream. then the thud of bodies or pieces of bodies coming down around them.}
<C>__{roach}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{muhhh fuhhh ...}
<A>__{he staggers back down the trench to go to sleep.}
