<L>__{interior cafteria}
<A>__{mark shale, a seventeen year old, rail thin pothead is sitting at a table in the crowded cafeteria eating lunch. the place is a zoo. cindy, a cute, mini skirted brunette, and ben, a frizzy haired, tattooed, pierced, punk rocker, are sitting with him. jody is standing at the door with her best friend sandy, looking for a place to sit. sandy is thin and a little underdeveloped for her age. she is wearing very little make up, a baggy shirt and baggy jeans. although she looks much more tomboyish than jody and a year or two younger, she is still quite cute and curvy, just lacking a bit in self confidence when it comes to boys. sandy is staring at mark.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{go sit next to him.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{mark shale.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{don't you want to talk to him? you watch him eat everyday.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{i don't watch him eat everyday.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{you stare at him non stop, like every lunch. like this. like most people stare at car accidents.}
<A>__{jody imitates sandy.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{the seat behind him is open. come on, i can eavesdrop too.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{you eventually have to talk to him.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{why? all my mom and dad ever do is watch each other eat and they've been married for twenty years.}
<A>__{cindy sees jody approaching and motions her over.}
<C>__{cindy}
<D>__{jody!}
<A>__{jody starts toward her table.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{no! that's his table.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{you're going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now.}
<A>__{the other three kids look up as jody sits don. sandy has no choice but to sit down next to mark. she immediately freezes up.}
<C>__{cindy}
<D>__{did your dad question you this morning?}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{just a little.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{did he ask you if stacy and rod has ever exchanged bodily fluids?}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{no. why?}
<C>__{cindy}
<D>__{he asked marliston.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{if they had ever gone all the way?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{yeah. chris berringer was parked outside the window.}
<C>__{cindy}
<D>__{i wonder why it's so important to know if they fucked?}
<A>__{sandy is completely frozen. jody realizes it. mark is paying no attention to her.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what i don't understand is why they asked marliston if rod was a virgin. they could have asked you cindy.}
<C>__{cindy}
<D>__{i never fucked rod.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{exactly. then he must be a virgin.}
<A>__{jody nudges sandy under the table, trying to prompt her to say something. sandy can only stare at mark as he eats.}
<C>__{cindy}
<D>__{if i'm so all used up ben, why do you try to hook me up non stop?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{as fucking if.}
<A>__{across the cafeteria, a sophomore annette storms in very upset. she confronts dylan, her junior boyfriend.}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{you're a shitsucking liar!}
<C>__{dylan}
<P>__{(taunting)}
<D>__{better than being a 'cocksucking' liar!}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{shut your face!}
<A>__{annette leaps on dylan and starts violently scratching him. mr. marliston runs over and pulls her off. he drags annette away.}
<C>__{annette}
<D>__{he's been telling people....}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{you can tell me all about it in my office. calm down. we're all on edge today.}
<A>__{he guides her out. sandy gets up her nerve and makes eye contact with mark.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{what's up with that?}
<A>__{mark opens a twinkie and starts to eat it.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{dylan's been telling people that annette gave him a blow job.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{and she didn't?}
<A>__{ben and mark laugh.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{there's a better chance that he got head from all five spice girls.}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{that's horrible.}
<A>__{cindy laughs at sandy. sandy doesn't appreciate being laughed at.}
<C>__{cindy}
<D>__{i think it's funny.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{me too. i'm going to start telling people that i saw her drop to her knees and latch on to his unit vector.}
<A>__{cindy laughs. the first meeting hasn't gone well for sandy. jody feels for her and jumps to her rescue.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{you wouldn't?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i would if dylan paid me.}
