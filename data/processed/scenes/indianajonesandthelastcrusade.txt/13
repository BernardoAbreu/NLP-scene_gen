<A>__{indy's eyes take a moment to adjust to the dark. a bit of sunlight leaks in through the cracks between the boards. then indy sees it. at the far end of the boxcar. rising slowly to its feet... an african lion. the lion roars. the boxcar walls shake. indy gasps. dust swirls up into the shafts of sunlight. and indy has one more surprise in store: the cross of cortes has been dislodged from his belt during the fall... indy glances around, sees a coiled lion tamer's whip hanging on a nail. he carefully takes it down by the handle. the lion sees this and growls softly. indy swallows hard and gives the whip a try. it unravels awkwardly, its tip flying back and hitting indy in the face... cutting his chin. the lion growls louder. indy quickly gathers up the whip, wets his lips, and tries again. this timesuccess! the whip cracks sharply. the lion bellows and swats the air... and steps back. indy looks amazed and delighted. he cracks the whip again. the lion backs away even more. indy inches forwardbends down (never taking his eyes off the lion)picks up the crossand steps back again, sweat pouring down his face. but now... how to get out? he looks up at the opening through which he fell and sees fedora looking down at him. fedora extends his hand.}
