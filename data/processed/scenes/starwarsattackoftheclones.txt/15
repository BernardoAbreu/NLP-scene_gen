<A>__{anakin and obi wan continue their conversation in the main room of the apartment.}
<D>__{obi wan you look tired.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{i don't sleep well, anymore. obi wan because of your mother?}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{i don't know why i keep dreaming about her now. i haven't seen her since i was little. obi wan dreams pass in time.}

<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{she's not like the others in the senate, master. obi wan it's been my experience that senators are only focused on pleasing those who fund their campaigns... and they are more than willing to forget the niceties of democracy to get those funds.}
<C>__{anakin}

<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{i think he is a good man. my instincts are very positive about...}
<A>__{anakin looks stunned. he looks sharply at obi wan}
<D>__{obi wan i sense it, too.}
