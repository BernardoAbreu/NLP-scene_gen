<L>__{exterior ruby's house night}
<A>__{a tiny, single story house one or two rooms at the most, in serious need of repair and maintenance. no yard. the house sits on dirt. the nearest other structure is at least a hundred yards away. a very solitary place. the windows are dark, painted over from the inside. some large pieces of exotic looking equipment are sitting off the front porch. after a beat, the front door opens, letting out a soft, feeble light. ruby steps out onto the porch, carrying a gallon size plastic jug. the light from the house now lights the equipment a little, giving us a better view. there's a contraption that appears to be a pump of some kind, with a funnel on top, spigot at the bottom, and several stages of filters and tubing in between. ruby sets the jug underneath the spigot... then sits down for a moment on the edge of the porch. she takes a breath and runs a hand through her hair, stretches her back, trying to work out some of the kinks in her neck. an exhausting day.}
<B>__{picard}
<A>__{is watching her intently from afar. he's concealed behind a supporting beam of one the town's many windmills. he's in shadow, hidden from ruby's view.}
<B>__{ruby}
<A>__{pulls off her jacket. she's wearing a pull over shirt... and in one motion she pulls off the shirt, revealing only a tee shirt underneath, sleeves torn off long ago. she stands up... kicks off her boots... undoes her pants... and begins sliding the jeans off her hips...}
<B>__{picard}
<A>__{is surprised. glances around, a little awkward. this really isn't why he came out here.}
<B>__{ruby}
<A>__{kicks aside the jeans. she's now down to tee shirt and panties. she grabs the bottom of the tee shirt... pulls it off...}
<B>__{picard}
<A>__{doesn't want to look, but can't help himself...}
<B>__{ruby}
<A>__{moves to the side of the porch... and steps into a large enviromental suit, a bulky one piece with gloves and helmet attached.}
<B>__{picard}
<A>__{is a little relieved... keeps watching...}
<B>__{ruby}
<A>__{has now encased herself in the thick, rubbery suit... pulls over a helmet with a gas mask. she walks over to an oil drum marked with a distinctive bio hazard symbol. she carefully opens the lid... takes a metal pitcher... reaches down into the drum and scoops out a pitcher full of toxic waste. she closes the lid, walks over to the pump filter contraption. she pours the sludge like waste into the funnel...primes the pump... makes a few adjustments to the filters... and then turns the spigot... after a beat, a trickle of clear liquid starts to come out of the spigot. ruby steps back and pulls off the helmet.}
<B>__{picard}
<A>__{watches, curious about what she's doing...}
<B>__{ruby}
<A>__{is now out of the bio suit again... pulling on her shirt and jeans... grabs her jacket... turns off the lights in the house, and shuts the front door behind her. she begins walking toward the windmill.}
<B>__{picard}
<A>__{steps behind the girder, stays very still in the shadows... waits quietly as ruby passes by the windmill without a glance and heads into town. after she's gone, picard steps out from his hiding place, watches her go, then quickly heads for ruby's house...}
<B>__{front porch}
<A>__{picard opens the front door and goes inside... but he doesn't notice that at the base of the doorjamb a small red light starts flashing some sort of silent alarm.}
