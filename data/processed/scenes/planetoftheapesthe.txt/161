<A>__{taylor scribbles something on a small desk pad, rips off the page, hands it to cornelius.}
<C>__{cornelius}
<D>__{jefferson public school, fort wayne, indiana?}
<A>__{he looks at taylor narrowly. taylor nods.}
<C>__{cornelius}
<P>__{(sardonically)}
<D>__{back on that planet you say you came from?}
<P>__{(taylor nods again)}
<D>__{um hm.}
<P>__{(to zira)}
<D>__{he may be intelligent, but he's also mad.}
<A>__{taylor scribbles something else on the pad, hands it to zira, points at cornelius.}
<C>__{zira}
<P>__{(reads aloud)}
<D>__{'and you're a fool'.}
<A>__{she smiles. cornelius bristles.}
<C>__{cornelius}
<D>__{now, just a minute }
<C>__{zira}
<D>__{oh, cornelius, be quiet.}
<A>__{taylor has resumed writing. he hands the sheet to zira, who reads aloud.}
<C>__{zira}
<D>__{'dodge was killed in the hunt. what happened to landon?'}
<P>__{(looking at taylor)}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{cornelius}
<P>__{(scornfully)}
<D>__{and they fell out of the sky with you?}
<A>__{taylor writes quickly, hands the note to zira.}
<C>__{zira}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{'not fell flew!'}
<A>__{taylor impatiently begins to fold a sheet of paper.}
<C>__{cornelius}
<D>__{flight is a scientific impossibility.}
<C>__{zira}
<D>__{and even if it weren't, why fly? where would it get you?}
<A>__{taylor points to the floor and mouths the word "here." he flings the paper plane he has just fashioned into the air. it describes a graceful arc around the room and lands at the feet of cornelius, who slowly picks it up, then exchanges a long glance with zira.}
<C>__{cornelius}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{well, now...}
<A>__{taylor scribbles on a piece of paper, hands it to zira.}
<C>__{zira}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{'do you have maps?'}
<A>__{cornelius puts the paper plane on his desk, crosses to a wall map designed like a window shade. he pulls it down taylor and zira join him at the map.}
