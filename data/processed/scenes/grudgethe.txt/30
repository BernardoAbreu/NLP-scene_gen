<L>__{22 interior the house living room night}
<A>__{karen enters the room as the answering machine picks up, the voices of a happy couple on the greeting (in english):}
<P>__{matthew & jennifer (on machine)}
<D>__{"konnichiwa! matt and jennifer aren't around, leave a message."}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{"hey, guys, it's susan. matt, are you there? pick up... susan (on machine) (cont'd) okay, well, i'm leaving work now so you can try my cell, or just call me at home later."}
<A>__{the caller pauses. karen steps closer to the phone base, curious, listening:}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{"i just wanted to make sure mom is okay. yesterday was... a bit weird, and i'm just a little worried."}
<A>__{karen, reluctant but realizing she should pick up, reaches for the phone... ...but the phone base is empty. the cordless is missing. as karen tries to figure out how to answer with the base:}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{"listen, just give me a call when you can, okay?"}
<A>__{click. too late the caller hangs up. silence returns to the room... but not completely. karen hears the soft sound of whispering from nearby. beyond her, we see a pale face (kayako) pressed against the frosted window of the sliding door of the tatami room. the face pulls away from the glass just before karen turns towards it. but the sound of whispering continues. as she slowly walks to the door, we can make out some words:}
<C>__{emma }
<D>__{...i've told them over and over... i've told them over and over...}
<A>__{karen listens for a moment, then slides the door open.}
