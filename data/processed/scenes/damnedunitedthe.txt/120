<L>__{interior tunnel elland road day (1974)}
<A>__{the leeds players clatter off the pitch. covered in mud. walking in silence. no smiles. heads hung low.. caption: "leeds 0 manchester city 2. leeds are now fourth from bottom" jimmy gordon is waiting for clough..}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{the chairman wants to see you. said it was important. right away.}
<A>__{clough's face: already fearing the worst.}
<L>__{interior corridor outside boardroom day (1974)}
<A>__{clough walks along the corridor. past the photographs on the wall. the trophies in the cabinets. the pictures of a smiling don revie mocking him. clough shoots his cuffs. rolls his neck. a boxer on his way to the ring. a gladiator on his way to the circus. he knocks on the door, and walks in. manny cussins, sam bolton and a third man. a stranger.}
<C>__{bolton}
<D>__{about bloody time.}
<C>__{cussins}
<D>__{where you been? i was about to send out a search party.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{look, mr. cussins, i know it's not been the best of starts, but in my defence, there are a couple of things i'd like to say...}
<C>__{cussins}
<D>__{this is martin hughes. he runs mercedes here in the north.}
<C>__{clough}
<P>__{(double takes)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{cussins}
<D>__{we hear that's what you like to drive. a mercedes?}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{it's..what i used to drive at derby. yes.}
<C>__{cussins}
<D>__{well, we can't have leeds united being outdone by derby county, can we? so martin here is going to take you over to his showroom and get you sorted out.}
<A>__{they begin to walk to the door. cussins puts his arm round}
<B>__{clough...}
<C>__{cussins }
<D>__{also we figured if you were sitting in a spanking new car yourself, you might be a little more bloody lenient with your senior players, who've kicked off, as you can imagine being denied what's rightfully theirs.}
<C>__{bolton}
<D>__{never come between a footballer and his motor!}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{bolton}
<D>__{especially not billy bloody bremner.}
<A>__{clough smiles nervously, visibly relieved...}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{is that it, then?}
<C>__{cussins}
<D>__{why? you look white as a ghost, man.}
<A>__{cussins tightens his grip again, arm round clough. unmistakably intimidating..}
<C>__{cussins }
<D>__{what did you think we'd asked you up here for?}
<A>__{cussins's eyes. clough's eyes. the air crackling with menace and intent.}
