<L>__{exterior school payphone afternoon}
<A>__{brendan slumps against it, receiver to his ear, licking a bruised lip. he wears dark glasses.}
<C>__{the brain}
<P>__{(on the phone)}
<D>__{you didn't call.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{sorry. kara went home though, didn't she?}
<C>__{the brain}
<D>__{yeah, but she stopped at a payphone and made two calls that she didn't want on her phone bill.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{get the numbers?}
<C>__{the brain}
<D>__{no. sorry.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{s'alright. are me and brad front page news?}
<C>__{the brain}
<D>__{all the buzz. you really do that?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{the brain}
<D>__{why? is brad the pin?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{brad's a sap. i downed him on his field and his crew didn't bite. so now i know he's a sap and anyone who acts like he isn't is profiting by it. that's not why i roughed him, though.}
<C>__{brain}
<D>__{for kicks?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{economics. brad's the school's biggest jake buyer, so if this pin is behind all the selling, i just got his attention. anyway, now's just shaking things out. look, you know a kid around the burgh, lanky, short, shaved head, turns a black tang?}
<C>__{the brain}
<D>__{i told you before i don't know the car. those types are a nickel a pound, but nobody i know that you don't. and trueman again }
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{keep him off. and keep your specs on i need to find that kid.}
<C>__{the brain}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{brendan hangs up and turns sluggishly. a lanky kid with a short shaved head and engineer boots punches him in the face. brendan hits the pavement. the lanky kid is over him in a split second, beating his face and body with short, heavy blows. flashes of the lanky kid a shiny scar shaped like a thin triangle runs down the side of his face. after a brief silent thrashing the kid walks off with several other blurry figures. a car peels out and roars off}
<B>__{o.s.}
<A>__{brendan lies still. the class bell rings, very distant. legs criss cross before his eyes, each blurring the world a bit more until it is completely smeared.}
