<A>__{to mac in the vault. he clicks his mouse to create another clock at the right of the screen, labeled china terminal time. shows the same time as the other clocks. 11:58:22.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{i feel for these boys. let's give them a breather, hmmn?}
<A>__{clicks the mouse, and the british terminal time begins flashing.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{we'll let the brits go off line 4 seconds early.}
<A>__{as the flashing clock reaches 11:58:30, and mac hits the key four times, advancing the british clock to 34 seconds, four seconds later than the others.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{and we'll give our new chinese overlords 4 extra seconds of rest before they have to go on line.}
<A>__{as the local and chinese clocks reach 40 seconds, mac hits the key four times, regressing the chinese clock back to 36 seconds. we watch all three clocks, clicking down the last moments of british rule. the british clock is 4 seconds fast, the chinese clock 4 seconds slow.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{playing god here, ginger. we've created 8 seconds that do not exist, anywhere but in this room.}
<A>__{local time...11:59:00. one minute to midnight.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{8 seconds, where no one is on line but your little cd rom.}
<A>__{he turns around. her eyes are waiting. across the room.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{and when, eventually, everyone discovers what transaction xj6 was really about...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{china will think it happened before midnight. britain will swear it happened after midnight...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{they'll each be positive. the other guy. did it.}
<A>__{mac sighs. this is a sad thing.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{liable to be an ugly international incident.}
<A>__{she squints across at his clock.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{britain off line in 18 seconds. we're bulletproof.}
<A>__{his smile returns. bittersweet and real...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{baby girl. nothing. is bulletproof. ever.}
<A>__{the look holds. he turns back to his screen. she lingers on him for an instant. then, back to the mainframe, finger poised above her enter key...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{britain goes bye bye in 6... 5...4...3.}
