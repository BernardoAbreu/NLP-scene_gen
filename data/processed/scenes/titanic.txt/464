<A>__{in a hovering downangle we see jack and rose floating in the black water. the stars reflect in the mill pond surface, and the two of them seem to be floating in interstellar space. they are absolutely still. their hands are locked together. rose is staring upwards at the canopy of stars wheeling above her. the music is transparent, floating... as the long sleep steals over rose, and she feels peace. close on rose's face. pale, like the faces of the dead. she seems to be floating in a void. rose is in a semi hallucinatory state. she knows she is dying. her lips barely move as she sings a scrap of jack's song:}

<A>__{"come josephine in my flying machine..." rose's pov: the stars. like you've never seen them. the milky way a glorious band from horizon to horizon. a shooting star flares... a line of light across the heavens. tight on rose again. we see that her hair is dusted with frost crystals. her breathing is so shallow, she is almost motionless. her eyes track down from the stars to the water. rose's pov... slow motion: the silhouetter of a boat crossing the stars. she sees men in it, rowing so slowly the oars lift out of the syrupy water, leaving weightless pearls floating in the air. the voices of the men sound slow and distorted. then the lookout flashes his torch toward her and the light flares across the water, silouetting the bobbing corpses in between. it flicks past her motionless form and moves on. the boat is 50 feet away, and moving past her. the men look away. rose lifts her head to turn to jack. we see that her hair has frozen to the wood under her.}

<A>__{jack. she touches his shoulder with her free hand. he doesn't respond. rose gently turns his face toward her. it is rimed with frost. he seems to be sleeping peacefully. but he is not asleep. rose can only stare at his still face as the realization goes through her.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{oh, jack. all hope, will and spirit leave her. she looks at the boat. it is further away now, the voices fainter. rose watches them go. she closes her eyes. she is so weak, and there just seems to be no reason to even try. and then... her eyes snap open. she raises her head suddenly, cracking the ice as she rips her hair off the wood. she calls out, but her voice is so weak they don't hear her. the boat is invisible now, the torch light a star impossibly far away. she struggles to draw breath, calling again.}
