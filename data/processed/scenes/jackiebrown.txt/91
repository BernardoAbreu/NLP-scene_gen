<A>__{ordell and jackie sit on stools around the kitchen counter bar. louis sits with them on the phone, silent.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{nicolet and dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{man, i don't like that part.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{it washes off. i tell them we're doing it the same way as before. they'll follow sheronda. i hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{she won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{are you sure she don' know about the money?}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{she don't know shit about the money.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{what does she think she's gettin?}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{i told her this is a game us rich folks play, exchanging gifts. like a scavenger hunt. she didn't know what that was neither.}
<P>__{(to louis)}
<D>__{no answer?}
<A>__{louis shakes his head.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{hang it up, she's on her way. you gotta listen to this. this involves you.}
<A>__{louis hangs up the phone and joins the debriefing.}
<C>__{ordell }
<D>__{no, you gonna give her a robinson's may bag this time?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{right, the one simone gives me. simone and i will make the switch at robinson's may. she knows what i look like?}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{she saw you with sheronda. so simone goes to the dress department with her robinson's may bag.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{designer clothes.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{she waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{the fitting room. there's a sign over the door.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{why we doin' i there?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i have a hunch they'll be watchin' me. we can't risk switching bags out in the open or even in the dining area. that's why it has to be a woman, 'cause we do the switch in the fitting room.}
<C>__{ordell}
<D>__{so you come out with her robinson's may bag, go meet sheronda. simone peeks out, waits for my man louis here to give her a signal nobody's watchin'. she leaves the store, gets in her car mission accomplished.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{where you gonna be during all this?}
