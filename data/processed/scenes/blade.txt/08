<A>__{dennis follows raquel through the bowels of the plant, catching glimpses here and there of carcasses being rendered or hacked apart. through one partially open door we see what might be a line of bodybags being trundled into the back of a truck via a hook and chain pulley system. but dennis doesn't have enough time to be disturbed by the vision, because he's being pulled away by raquel, led down }
<B>__{a stairwell}
<A>__{we are in the basement now. at the end of the hall is a steel door, with perhaps, just the faintest hint of music heard coming from beyond. raquel knocks. a "peep hole" slat opens and a black light shines into raquel's eyes. a voice behind the door offers a verbal challenge, speaking a language we've never heard, laced with a devilish cadence. raquel responds in kind. the door opens. raquel gives dennis a knowing wink, enters. dennis follows.}
