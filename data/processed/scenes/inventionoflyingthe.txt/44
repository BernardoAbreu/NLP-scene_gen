<C>__{greg}
<D>__{here comes bottom.}
<A>__{mark looks worried. the cop comes to greg's window.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{nothing safer than pulling over two nerdy white guys in their forties.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{i don't want to go to jail.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{are you drunk?}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{then you're going to jail. blow in here, son.}
<A>__{the cop pulls out a breathalyzer and holds it up to greg's mouth.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{wait, officer. don't do that.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{i don't think you can afford my bribe, son.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{how much does it cost to bribe you?}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{at least five grand.}
<C>__{mark and greg}
<D>__{wow, that's high.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{i need to feel that i've got some sense of integrity.}
<A>__{greg blows in the breathalyzer.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{whoa, that's off the charts. step out of the car, son. you're drunk and going to jail.}
<A>__{greg opens the door.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{wait.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{he's not drunk.}
<A>__{greg stumbles and falls, passing out in the dirt. the cop stares at mark for a long beat while his brain wraps around this.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{the cop bangs his breathalyzer against his leg.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{damn thing must be broken.}
<A>__{in the background we can hear greg vomiting profusely. the cop picks up greg and puts him back in the driver's seat.}
<C>__{cop}
<P>__{(to greg)}
<D>__{son, you might want to drive yourself to the nearest hospital. you have food poisoning or some kind of flu.}
<A>__{mark is basically passed out, vomit drooling down his chin. he couldn't look more drunk. the cop and mark stare at him for a beat.}
<C>__{cop}
<P>__{(to mark)}
<D>__{maybe you oughta drive, son.}
<C>__{mark}
