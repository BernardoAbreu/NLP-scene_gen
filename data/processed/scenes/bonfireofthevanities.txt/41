<C>__{judge white}

<C>__{kramer}
<D>__{your honor, the district attorney, mr. weiss...}
<C>__{judge white}
<D>__{i know who the district attorney is. i know mr. weiss. and the only reason mr. weiss is interested in the case is because mr. williams over there is a white man who lives in a nice big house in riverdale.}
<C>__{kramer}
<D>__{i don't follow, sir...}
<C>__{judge white}
<D>__{because this is an election year. because ninety nine percent of the people you shovel through here are black and the other ninety nine percent don't even speak english. but they do vote.}
<C>__{judge white }
<D>__{so mr. weiss, your boss, the district attorney who dreams every night that someday he is going to be mayor of new york city what he needs is a white man. he needs to find him, book him, and throw him in jail. then he looks good to everybody. the press likes it, the voters like it, even your mother will like it. you follow me now, mr. kramer?}
<C>__{kramer}
<D>__{yes, your honor.}
<C>__{judge white}
<D>__{so you go tell your boss, the district attorney, captain ahab weiss that i know he's out there looking for the great white defendent... but mr. williams over there is not it.}
