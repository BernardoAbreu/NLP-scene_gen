<L>__{exterior sacred hill sunrise}
<A>__{the silhouette of a distant hill with druid stones on top. carrying the baby, willow climbs the hill with his fami ly. he wears a papoose rig, supply pack, and a dagger. he hands the baby to kiaya, then walks through the towering stones. the high aldwin solemnly looks out at the distant forest.}
<C>__{high aldwin}
<D>__{now, you know where you're going?}
<P>__{(willow shakes his head)}
<D>__{down there, through those trees, follow the river. you'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc ture. willow, this is serious business. don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a nelwyn. give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{if i'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can i do this?}
<C>__{high aldwin}
<D>__{you're strong enough. but you're going to need courage, willow.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{i don't want courage. i don't want to be a warrior. all i've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!}
<C>__{high aldwin}
<D>__{real magic, willow, is simply the art of controlling the reality of others. you lack faith in your self. you must learn to trust your intuition.}
<A>__{the high aldwin picks up a rock. with intense concen tration he squeezes it in his outstretched hand. then throws it in the air. it changes into a bird and flies away.}
<C>__{high aldwin}
<D>__{go in the direction the bird is flying.}
<C>__{willow}
<P>__{(amazed)}
<D>__{oh, if i could do that i'd i'd turn burglekutt into a toad!}
<C>__{high aldwin}
<D>__{waste magic on revenge? you have much to learn, willow...}
<A>__{the high aldwin touches willow's shoulder and turns away. the children are playing tag among the stones. willow hugs them. kiaya places the baby in the papoose.}
<C>__{kiaya}
<D>__{willow, we've never been apart. i miss you already. take this. it will bring you luck.}
<A>__{kiaya, whose head is covered with a kerchief, places a braided necklace on her own hair around willow's neck.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{you cut your hair, kiaya?}
<A>__{he kisses her. the adjusts the papoose and heads off down the hill. the others wave goodbye sadly.}
<C>__{kiaya}
<D>__{willow!!}
<A>__{kiaya rushes down the hill and passionately throws her arms around willow, tears in her eyes. at last they break apart, and willow begins the journey.}
