<A>__{over shot soft strumming guitars and two voices singing a quiet blues. there are scattered groups,about fifteen men in all playing pool, ping pong, reading, writing letters, talking. camera reaches private sal anderson and friday clark, playing the guitars and singing. clark plays only passably, but anderson is highly accomplished, effortlessly sounding off chord progressions in diminished minors. friday, the bugler, is about twenty four, with shy, trusting eyes. anderson is the same age, also quiet, non aggressive. camera continues panning, passes a soldier reading a newspaper who shakes his head and mutters, "... ain't it terrible about lou gehrig dyin...", then moves in to hold on a group at a window seat, bulling. prew is stretched out wearily, looks as if he's been through another recent dose of the treatment. maggio perches in the frame of the window like an aggressive robin. treadwell slouches at the end of the seat. pete karelsen is in a chair nearby, reading a magazine.}
