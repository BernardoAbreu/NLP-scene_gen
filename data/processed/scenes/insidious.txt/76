<L>__{interior doctor's office day}
<A>__{dr. bryce trimble (52) sits opposite renai and josh. spread out in front of him are a series of x rays, labelled dalton lambert. his office is big and expensive. renai looks hopeful. josh looks like a shell of a man.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{we just wanna say...thank you so much. for helping us out with this, doctor. we can't tell you how much it means to have you involved.}
<C>__{dr. trimble}
<D>__{i'm glad to help.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{unfortunately...these recent tests have proven inconclusive. there's absolutely nothing abnormal here.}
<A>__{josh and renai deflate.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{so...if you're the top of the food chain with this stuff, where does that leave us?}
<C>__{dr. trimble}
<D>__{i don't know. there is a research team in boston who specialize in a new form of treatment. they try to stimulate the patients brain with electric pulses. it has a good success rate with victims of brain injury. we could try that.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{so there's hope?}
<C>__{dr. trimble}
<D>__{there are more things we can try.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the hope part is up to you.}
