<L>__{interior vaughan's car night}
<A>__{james rides in vaughan's car. vaughan drives aggressively, rolling the heavy car along the access roads, holding the battered bumpers a few feet behind any smaller vehicle until it moves out of the way.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{i've always wanted to drive a crashed car.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{you could get your wish at any moment.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{no, i mean a crash with a history. camus's facel vega, or nathaniel west's station wagon, grace kelly's rover 3500. fix it just enough to get it rolling. don't clean it, don't touch anything else.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{is that why you drive this car? i take it that you see kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car crash?}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{the case could be made.}
<A>__{they approach a major intersection. for almost the first time on this drive, vaughan applies the brakes. the heavy car sways and goes into a long right hand slide which carries it across the path of a taxi. flooring the accelerator, vaughan swerves in front of it, tires screaming over the blaring horn of the taxi. as they settle down, vaughan reaches behind him and lifts a briefcase off the back seat.}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{take a look at this and tell me what you think.}
<A>__{james opens the briefcase and slides out a thick packet of glossy photographs, all of them marked up with coloured ink pens. the photos are culled from a variety of sources newspapers, magazines, video stills, film frames blown up to uniform}
