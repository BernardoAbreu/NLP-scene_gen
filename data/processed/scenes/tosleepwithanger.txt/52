<L>__{interior gideon's kitchen day}
<A>__{harry and babe brother are playing cards while linda watches and sunny plays by himself on the floor. in the sink is a newspaper full of bloody feathers. a small flame is under a pot on the stove. harry looks at the chicken in the pot and sits back down.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{you don't act like the rest of gideon's friends. they believe if you are not hard at work, you are hard at sin.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{oh, i'm more modern in my ways. i don't believe in sin, though there is good and evil.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and evil is a thing you work at.}
<A>__{harry takes his knife, a crab apple switch, out. it has a rabbit foot attached to it. harry cleans his fingernail with the knife. sunny is interested in the rabbit foot. he reaches for the knife.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{not you mustn't touch. your mama might not like you handling knives.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{i think he wants to see your rabbit foot.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that i lost years ago.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{what's a toby?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you don't want to be at crossroads without one. it's a charm that old people teach you how to make. i had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{in my travels i misplaced it. i have been looking over my shoulder ever since.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{i thought you weren't old fashioned.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{in some things. when we were children, there used to be an old man that came around and would snatch your soul if you didn't have something on you that didn't make a x.}
<A>__{harry is aware that babe brother is interested in the knife. after cleaning his last fingernail, he hands the knife to babe brother. harry looks at the cards in his hand. he smiles to himself.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{did you have your child at home?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{no. no. no. no. i had my child at cedars and sinai. and that ain't no county hospital. you have to have cash or check before you come in the door.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{some folks take that natural stuff too far.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. that's why i do not eat over there now.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{country people got so many strange ways,}
<A>__{harry looks again at the chicken that he is boiling.}
<C>__{babe brother}
<D>__{did you ever have to use this thing?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{that is called a crab apple switch. it's for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog. now i don't know if i actually did what i did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk's stories but i seem to recall that i had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home. i was up in memphis working on the railroad, like your daddy who had an easy job. he would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track. anyway i was coming down beale street and i heard this music coming from a saloon. sure enough it was emory. my daddy taught both of us to play but emory was natural at it. got in a blues band and what not. he and another boy had killed a boy named hocker sometime back and they balled the jack leaving town. emory had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face. bad luck i would say. he got to drinking that corn liquor. we went to his girl's room and he wouldn't stop drinking. he started talking about the old days and he went mad. he pulled his knife and i got to mine first. the lights went out.}
<A>__{linda picks up a card and looks at it. there is a naked woman on the back.}
<C>__{babe brother}
<D>__{don't pick up the cards if you are not in the game. did he die?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i don't know what happened to him. he just ran out into the streets.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i got some old records i want you to hear. i like the blues sung simply, man and a guitar. or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life. don't ever let anyone tell you his life's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness. when i was a boy, a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and i will be damned if the same thing didn't happen to me.}
<A>__{sunny is busy playing in the curtains. the sound of gideon and suzie arriving makes them scurry to get the cards put away. harry puts his knife away just as suzie and gideon enter. linda feels a little embarrassed.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{how was church?}
<A>__{gideon and suzie are surprised to see linda. they don't know what to say.}
