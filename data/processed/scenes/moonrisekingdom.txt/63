<L>__{interior station wagon. night}
<A>__{captain sharp pans a spot light back and forth in the darkness while he steers the car. the lamp has a short in it and flickers with each bump. mr. bishop rides in the passenger seat. he stares ahead down the road and says to}
<T>__{himself:}
<C>__{mr. bishop}
<D>__{how can we help her? she's got so many problems. it's getting worse.}
<A>__{mr. bishop looks strangely to captain sharp. he asks:}
<C>__{mr. bishop}
<D>__{whose fault is it?}
<C>__{captain sharp}
<P>__{(hesitates)}
<D>__{i don't know, but just for the record: ninety five percent of all runaways return home within six hours. that doesn't do you any good right now. it's just a statistic but in all likelihood suzy's probably hiding in the closet at her best friend's house playing chinese checkers at this very moment, as we speak.}
<C>__{mr. bishop}
<D>__{she doesn't have any friends.}
<C>__{captain sharp}
<P>__{(long pause)}
<D>__{how's laura?}
<C>__{mr. bishop}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{how's laura?}
<C>__{captain sharp}
<D>__{mrs. bishop, i mean.}
<C>__{mr. bishop}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{captain sharp}
<D>__{is she upset?}
<A>__{mr. bishop looks baffled and disgusted. he throws his hands into the air. he looks away and shakes his head. silence. captain sharp wiggles some wires.}
<C>__{captain sharp}
<D>__{i got to get this spot light fixed.}
