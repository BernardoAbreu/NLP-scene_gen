<L>__{interior coffee shop day}
<A>__{a few customers sit quietly minding their own business. a waitress leans near the cash register at one end of the counter. a transistor radio plays country music blues. the waitress looks up as somebody enters.}

<C>__{duncan }
<D>__{coffee.}
<A>__{it is duncan. he moves to the counter and sits.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{you get mugged?}
<C>__{duncan}
<D>__{black.}
<A>__{snubbed, the waitress comes back and sets the cup in front of him. she looks down at the change on the counter. there isn't enough.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{coffee's twenty seven.}
<A>__{duncan looks up at her resentfully.}
<C>__{waitress}
<P>__{(pulling away the cup)}
<D>__{coffee's twenty seven cents. ya got it or don't ya?}
<A>__{duncan glares at her. he doesn't have it.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{okay, buster, one cup. on the house.}
<A>__{she pushes the cup back to him. some of the coffee spills onto the counter.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{drink it and be on your way.}
<A>__{duncan slowly reaches for the cup, raises it to his lips.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{you're welcome.}
<A>__{duncan stops, sets the cup down, pushes it away from him and slowly rises from his seat.}
<C>__{duncan}
<D>__{no, thank you.}
<A>__{duncan and the waitress stand face to face, shooting darts at each other. then a man sitting two seats away reaches over and places a quarter on the counter between them. the waitress looks at the man irritatedly, then picks up the money and moves away. duncan slowly sits down again. he pulls the cup back to himself, then turns and looks at the man for a long moment, unable to express his gratitude.}
