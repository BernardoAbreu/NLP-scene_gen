<C>__{jake}
<D>__{sure, what else is new?}

<D>__{no. this time it's true. i didn't bother to tell you until i had everything worked out.}
<A>__{jake tries to open the door. it's locked.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{open the door, vickie.}
<C>__{vickie}
<D>__{no. i won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.}

<D>__{i'm sick of it. i can't watch you this way. you're too drunk all the time. there's too many girls. i can't... i don't wanna talk about it. i made up my mind.}
<A>__{jake tries to reach in the window, but vickie hits the power switch, closing it and catching his hand. she now has to yell to him:}
<C>__{vickie }
<D>__{you got three days to get your stuff out of the house. after that, the cops will be there. i have the kids with me. i never want to see you again.}
<A>__{vickie turns her face and drives away. jake grabs at the cadillac, but it is bigger and stronger than him. jake is left alone in the parking lot. the car is gone.}
