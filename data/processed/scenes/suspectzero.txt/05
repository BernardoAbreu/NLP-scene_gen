<A>__{speck guns the buick. interstate 35 flies by. the farther he gets away from that diner, the happier he'll be. ...until a strange sound gets his attention: it's wind, as if whistling through a ghost town. hollow, varied building then falling off again. wind. trouble is, the windows in this buick are up. yet there it is again: a thin, hollow ghost town wind, whistling over his shoulder. he's heard it before in every western he ever watched as a kid. but this wind is coming from his back seat. the blood drains right out of speck's face. doesn't know if he should jam on the brakes or drive faster. he looks in his rear view, catches a glimpse of a latex glove snapping onto a hand. dear god: o'ryan is back there, making that odd ghost town wind sound. whistling.}

<D>__{what do you want?! what do you want with me?!}
<A>__{no reply. instead, another gift appears from the back: a fourth drawing, tossed from the darkness into speck's lap. he looks down, registers the image... and shrieks.}
<C>__{o'ryan }
<D>__{there's a rest stop, next off ramp. pull into it.}
<C>__{speck}
<D>__{i have some money. it's not a lot but }
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{nobody wants your money, harold. just pull in.}
<C>__{speck}
<D>__{why?!}
<A>__{o'ryan rises into frame now, like nosferatu...}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{because i don't wanna do this at 70 miles an hour. it could be dangerous.}
<A>__{speck finds the off ramp. his breaths are shallow now.}
<C>__{speck}
<D>__{please, mister what do you want from me?}
<A>__{o'ryan's face: a knowing grin fans across it...}
