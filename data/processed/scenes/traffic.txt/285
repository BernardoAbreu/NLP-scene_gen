<L>__{interior white house office day}
<A>__{robert wakefield enters the office of the chief of staff, who looks up from what he's doing, which is reading robert's report, and is already mid sentence.}
<C>__{chief of staff}
<D>__{yeah, hi }
<P>__{(waves robert to a chair)}
<D>__{so i've got a copy of your speech here...}
<P>__{(glances down, still reading)}
<D>__{it's fantastic... so, robert, my genuine thanks. you're my choice and you're gonna be great. the president is sorry he hasn't been able to spend more time with you. after the press conference he wants to really sit down.}
<P>__{(an afterthought)}
<D>__{oh, i got to the post, too. don't worry about that thing with your daughter, it's not news; they're willing to treat it as a family matter, a personal matter.}
<P>__{(off robert's stare)}
<D>__{look, even if it came out, we'd turn it into a qualification, i've been in the trenches of this drug war, i have seen the face of the enemy, etcetera.}
<A>__{robert just stares at him.}
