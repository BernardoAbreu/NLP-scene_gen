<A>__{joe jr. doesn't notice or doesn't remark that his father, just before entering the store, draws a handgun from beneath his coat. the boy gazes dreamily at the street. the lunatic black santa marches by, ranting to himself ("then the white man say..."). the rain hammers on the roof and windshield. joe jr. breathes on the glass, fogging the scene. from the store: muffled gunfire. joe jr. looks that way. another gunshot, then: his father comes out the door clutching money in one hand. he strides toward the car with a reckless pride. he doesn't notice: the liquor store door opens behind him. a shotgun blast. joe stevens' guts splatter onto the car windshield. a look of terrible amazement; he sinks to his knees.}

<A>__{on a tv screen: a grainy black and white tape, date and time stamped at the bottom. a grungy street, palm trees. the light from the monitor dimly illuminates carver and stevens. on screen the camera finds: a man in jeans, sneakers and sweatshirt on a street corner.}
<C>__{stevens}
<D>__{he ought to be wearing a sign.}
<C>__{carver}
<D>__{you can tell he's a cop?}
<A>__{stevens laughs: it's obvious. a real drug dealer joins the cop. undercover cop: "you got it?" dealer: "in the motel, right over here..." the cop's uneasy, keeps glancing back toward the camera as they go.}
<C>__{stevens}
<D>__{he keeps looking for his back up. now, the other guy knows it, too.}
<C>__{carver}
<D>__{then why's he taking him to the room?}
<C>__{stevens}
<P>__{(why else?)}
<D>__{to rip him off.}
<A>__{carver studies stevens in the darkness, impressed. on screen: the figures disappear into the motel. we hear their voices. dealer: "here, try some of it." undercover cop: "uhh... no, i don't..." dealer: "why not, you sonofabitch?" two bursts of sound distortion. a plainclothes cop, taft, (black, stocky, powerful) bolts from behind the camera, sprints toward the motel. the camera wobbles after him.}
<C>__{stevens}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{too late.}

<D>__{oh, bobby... jesus, jesus...}
<P>__{(to the camera)}
<D>__{get an ambulance and back up. now!}
<A>__{he slams the wall, starts past the camera. carver pushes the pause button; the tape freezes on a jerky image of taft's face.}

<D>__{i can't do that. i've got a wife and kids.}
<C>__{carver}

<D>__{not grass. not nothing. i never even had a drink.}
<P>__{(his motto)}
<D>__{never have, never will. you don't understand. i made a choice in my life.}
<C>__{carver}
<D>__{what's to understand? you saw your father killed when you were ten, and you decided you wouldn't be like that.}
<P>__{(off stevens' surprise, carver grins)}
<D>__{i'm god, i know everything. you wanted to be a good boy, so you became a cop. hiding out in uniform... that's why you got the hard on for taft.}
<C>__{stevens}
<D>__{it's not that simple.}
<C>__{carver}
<P>__{(opening joe's file; as if reluctantly)}
<D>__{i will tell the truth, joe. you're never going to be a taft.}

<C>__{stevens}
<D>__{let me see that...}
<A>__{carver hands him the scores which are, of course, just clusters of numbers. stevens is upset, though oddly unsurprised, as if this only confirmed his secret fears.}

<D>__{why'd you join the force?}
<C>__{stevens}
<P>__{(awkward, but felt)}
<D>__{i wanted to be of use.}
<C>__{carver}

<D>__{there's a man named ramon gallegos who supplies 60% of the cocaine to the west coast. he's smart, smooth, and sufficiently elusive that we don't even have an adult photograph of him. however, his uncle is hector guzman, an important latin american political figure. gallegos uses uncle's connections to get product into the country, and everyone we've sent after him has ended up like that...}

<P>__{(displeased)}

<A>__{his strictness has already sobered their enthusiasm. sensing this, he attempts to embrace them which he can do only awkwardly. meanwhile, his wife, terry (southern white) has come out the screen door. she and stevens bristle at each other.}
