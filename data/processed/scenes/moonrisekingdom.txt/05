<L>__{exterior scout camp. day}
<A>__{a clearing in the woods with ten small, khaki tents pitched in a row. a banner on a flag pole ripples in the wind. it reads camp ivanhoe. a bugler in a khaki uniform with a yellow neckerchief plays a staccato tattoo. he has a gauze patch over one eye. he is lazy eye. a thirty five year old man in the same uniform emerges through the flaps of a larger tent. he is scout master ward. he puts on a wide brimmed felt hat. a badge on the crown reads khaki scouts, troop 55. he lights a cigarette. a thin scout with curly hair and sunglasses joins him at his side. he is gadge.}
<C>__{scout master ward}
<D>__{morning, gadge.}
<C>__{gadge}
<D>__{morning, sir.}
<A>__{gadge flips open a small, spiral bound note book. scout master ward goes over to a latrine made from thick sticks and rope. a tall, stooped scout digs a trench next to it with an army shovel. he is deluca.}
<C>__{scout master ward}
<D>__{deluca. latrine inspection.}
<A>__{deluca stops digging. he pulls on a rope and water runs down a chute. it bursts through a valve, spins a little door, and a small, red flag flips up. scout master ward nods.}
<C>__{scout master ward}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{gadge makes a note. scout master ward strides away. he stops in front of a scout with long hair over his eyes sitting on a stump twisting something in his fingers. he is roosevelt.}
<C>__{scout master ward}
<D>__{roosevelt. how's that lanyard coming?}
<C>__{roosevelt}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{i don't know. i think i skipped a stitch.}
