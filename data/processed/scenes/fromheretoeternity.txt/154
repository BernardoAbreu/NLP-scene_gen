<A>__{he is lying on a couch in pajamas. he has not shaven, his hair is unkempt. a radio announcer is heard over shot. prew wakens, groggy with hangover and near delirium, wrestles with the blanket over him. camera pulls back to medium shot, disclosing alma and gorgette. they have negligees over their nightgowns, are listening to the radio. the announcer's voice tries hard to be calm and official but he cannot keep the tremor out of it. (note: transcripts of the actual broadcast have been requested.)}
