<L>__{interior master bedroom night}
<A>__{in the master bedroom, meg flops over in bed, facing away from the doorway, really having a rough go of it. she slept too hard before, now she's awake, her head is killing her, she's really paying the price of four glasses of wine. she lies still, on her side, facing us. behind her, the bedroom door moves, silently. opening. the man stands there, one finger still on the door he's just pushed open. he stares at the sleeping form of meg on the bed, whose back is to him. he has no idea she's awake. meg lies in bed, eyes wide open, no idea a man is standing in the doorway to her bedroom. noiselessly, the man moves away, down the hall. the moment his head disappears down the stairwell meg flops over again, facing the doorway. she closes her eyes, gives sleep another try.}
