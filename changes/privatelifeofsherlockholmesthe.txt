<LOC>__{INT. BANK VAULT - DAY}
<ACTION>__{An iron gate opens, and two bank guards come in. One of them switches on the lights. On the shelves which line the walls are dusty strong-boxes, document cases, wrapped packages, etc. The guards move along the shelves searching for something.}
<CHAR>__{WATSON'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Somewhere in the vaults of a bank in London is a tin dispatch box with my name on it. It is not to be opened until fifty years after my death.}
<ACTION>__{The guards find a battered tin dispatch box with the name JOHN H. WATSON, M.D., painted on it. They remove it from the shelf, set it down on a table. The box is tied with heavy cord, the knots sealed with wax. Strung on the cord is the key.}
<CHAR>__{WATSON'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It contains certain mementos of my long association with a man who elevated the science of deduction to an art -- the world's first, and undoubtedly most famous, consulting detective.}
<ACTION>__{While one of the guards dusts the box off, the other cuts the cord with a pair of scissors. He then inserts the key in the lock, turns it, raises the lid -- revealing the dusty contents of the box. OVER THIS, SUPERIMPOSE THE MAIN TITLE. The guards now start to remove the objects from the box, one at a time: -- A daguerreotype of Holmes, standing, and Watson, seated, in a a stiff studio pose; Holmes' deerstalker hat, his curved pipe, his magnifying glass; Watson's stethoscope, Holmes' revolver; a small enamel sign with the number 221B; a pair of handcuffs; a sheet of music paper which is unrolled to disclose a violin piece composed by Holmes, titled FOR ILSE von H.; A pocket watch, the back of which is opened to reveal a photograph of Gabrielle Valladon; a signet ring bearing the initials S.H. -- under which is concealed a compass; a worn morocco case -- inside which is an early-model hypodermic syringe; a crystal ball which, when shaken, produces a snowstorm - and when the snow settles, we see a bust of Queen Victoria. OVER THESE OBJECTS, THE REST OF THE CREDIT TITLES ARE}
<ACTION_ALT>__{SUPERIMPOSED.}
<ACTION>__{The last item out of the box   is a thick stack of manuscript paper, bound with   green ribbon. The guard undoes the ribbon, dusts off   the top page, as CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSER.  Written in   ink, in the cursive penmanship of the period, is   the following paragraph:}
<DIAL>__{To my heirs: In my lifetime, I have recorded some sixty cases demonstrating the singular gift of my friend Sherlock Holmes -- dealing with everything from The Hound of the Baskervilles to his mysterious brother Mycroft and the devilish Professor Moriarty. But there were other adventures which, for reasons of discretion, I have decided to withhold from the public until this much later date. They involve matters of a delicate and sometimes scandalous nature, as will shortly become apparent.}

The rest of their luggage is on the racks above. They are, of course, SHERLOCK HOLMES and DR. JOHN H. WATSON. This being 1887, they are thirty- three and thirty-five respectively.}

Inserted into the ends of the rubber tubes are half a dozen cigarettes, four cigars of different shapes and colors, and four pipes, all lit. Activated by the bellows, they are puffing away like mad, wheezing loudly and filling the screen with smoke. Seated at the table is Holmes, in shirt-sleeves. Occasionally he knocks off an ash onto a glass slide, studies it under a microscope. Watson, in a dressing gown, is sitting in the chair with the writing arm, documenting the latest Holmes adventure for Strand Magazine. The open mail has now been affixed to the center of the wooden mantelpiece, with a dagger. Mrs. Hudson is clearing the dinner dishes from the table, and loading them onto the shelf of the dumbwaiter. The accumulation of smoke in the room makes her cough.}

Watson is first to notice it and jumps to his feet, making choking noises. Gabrielle sees it and screams. Watson grabs an oar, throws it at the monster as it comes past. The backwash hits the boat broadside, rocking it, and Holmes, Watson and Gabrielle are spilled into the lake. The monster moves away from them, heading in the general direction of the castle. It disappears into the mist. Holmes is the first to come up, looks around, sees Gabrielle surfacing a few yards away, swims to her.}

<DIAL>__{Aren't you going to finish your breakfast?}
<ACTION>__{Holmes doesn't answer. Watson takes a lump of sugar out of the bowl with a pair of tongs, drops it into his coffee. Then glancing over his shoulder to make sure Holmes isn't watching, he swivels the letter around with the tongs. It is written on Diogenes Club stationery, and reads:}
<DIAL>__{9th December, 1888 Dear Sherlock, My sources in Tokyo inform me that Ilse von Hoffmanstal was arrested last week by the Japanese counter-intelligence service for spying on naval installations in Yokohama harbour. After a secret trial, she was summarily executed by a firing squad. It might interest you to know that}
<ACTION>__{The page ends at this point. Watson turns the sheet of paper over with the tongs. The letter continues on the other side.}
<DIAL>__{she had been living in Japan these past few months under the name of Mrs. Ashdown. Sincerely, Mycroft}
<ACTION>__{Watson looks toward Holmes, who is still standing with his back to the room, gets up from the table.}

<DIAL>__{In the files. May to July, 1885.}
<ACTION>__{Holmes turns to the bookshelves above the desk.   From a row of similar volumes, he slides out the three  files marked MAY, JUNE, and JULY 1885. Actually, it's   the medical bag, standing on end, with the spines of  three volumes pasted on the bottom.}
<CHAR>__{HOLMES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're getting better.}
<ACTION>__{He sets the bag down on the desk, opens it, takes out a bottle of cocaine. Watson watches him with compassion as he crosses to his bedroom with his cocaine, goes in, shuts the door. Footsteps are heard hurrying up the stairs, and after a moment there is a knock on the door. Watson approaches the door, opens it to reveal INSPECTOR LESTRADE -- a short, nervous man whose features are sharper than his mind. He is wearing an overcoat, his bowler is in his hands, and his fingers are drumming on the crown.}

<DIAL>__{Oh... Well, I just thought it was the kind of case that might interest him. I dare say we can solve it without his help.}
<CHAR>__{WATSON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, I'm sure you will.}
<ACTION>__{From Holmes' bedroom comes the sound of a melancholy tune being played on the violin. Watson starts to ease Lestrade out of the door.}

<DIAL>__{Good day, Lestrade.}
<ACTION>__{He shuts the door after him, listens to the sound of the violin for a moment. Then he crosses to the wicker chair, seats himself. He takes some sheets of paper out of the rack and places them on the writing arm, dips his pen in the inkwell, starts to write.
