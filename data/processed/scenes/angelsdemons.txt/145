<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{int church of illumination night}
<A>__{langdon and vittoria creep into the church of illumination, and we get our first good look at it. the embellishments, though faded, are replete with familiar symbology. pentagram tiles. planet frescoes. pyramids.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{we have thirty minutes left, i can still change the battery if we can find the cannister.}
<A>__{langdon nods, but he's fascinated by the place. in the center of the room, there is an open fireplace, its embers still smoking. the four illuminati brands, their faces wiped clean, have been placed back in a molded velvet case. langdon, fascinated, spots an empty slot in the very center of the case, surrounded by the four used brands. but this one's missing. vittoria arrives over his shoulder, having completed a quick search of the place.}
<C>__{vittoria }
<D>__{it isn't here.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{there's a fifth brand.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{he touches the indentation in the velvet, puzzling it out.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{two crossed keys.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{the symbol for the vatican?}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{the papacy.}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{they're going to kill him. before they blow up the vatican they're going to kill and brand the pope himself.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{but there is no pope.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{technically, there is.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{the camerlengo?! we have to }
<C>__{mr. gray }
<D>__{please place your gun on the floor.}
<A>__{they freeze. vittoria looks at langdon, who nods you'd better do it. she does.}
<C>__{mr. gray }
<D>__{now turn around.}
<A>__{they turn and face mr. gray. he looks quite dapper, and not too much the worse for wear. there is a briefcase on the ground beside him, and he's changed into a fresh shirt.}
<C>__{mr. gray }
<D>__{kick it to me.}
<A>__{she does. he picks it up, ejects the clip and the round in the chamber, pockets them, and tosses the gun into the smoldering fire.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{you could have been long gone by now.}
<C>__{mr. gray}
<D>__{some do god's work for love, others for money. which do you take me for?}
<A>__{as if to answer his own question, he picks up the briefcase from the floor beside him. then studies langdon for a moment.}
<C>__{mr. gray}
<D>__{you're not one of them.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{neither are you. i was expecting a fanatic.}
<C>__{mr. gray}
<D>__{when they call me and they all call me it is so important to them that i know what they ask is the lord's will. or allah's, or yahweh's. and i suppose they're right. because if he were not vengeful, i would not exist, would i?}
<A>__{he picks up his briefcase.}
<C>__{mr. gray }
<D>__{be careful. these are men of god.}
<A>__{he turns to go. langdon can't help himself:}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{why didn't you kill us when you had the chancer}
<A>__{vittoria looks at langdon like he's nuts. mr. gray turns back, seems puzzled by the very thought.}
<C>__{mr. gray}
<D>__{because no one asked me to.}
<A>__{he leaves. langdon and vittoria pause for a moment, look at each other }
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{we've got to get to the vatican.}
