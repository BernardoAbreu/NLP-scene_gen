<ACTION>__{Tight on a gloved hand as a lever is released. Tight on the cables at the top of a rickety chair lift as they kick into motion. Wider as an empty chair swivels around and beneath the asses of a threesome of SKIERS. Even wider to reveal a long line of Skiers and SNOWBOARDERS awaiting their moment to step up to the chair. The camera finds a group of three standing off to the side of the line, decked out in their winter gear.}
