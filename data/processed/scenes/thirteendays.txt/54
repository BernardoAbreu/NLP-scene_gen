<A>__{other excom members draw near the board, its order of battle, strike maps. they're grim, but fascinated. empowering. intoxicating. sexy. kenny sees it in the faces, even the president's. adlai does too, is upset.}
<C>__{adlai}
<D>__{i still think there are diplomatic approaches we haven't considered yet.}
<A>__{kenny looks at adlai. the others around the room, embarrassed, don't respond. the group has moved on and stevenson hasn't.}
<C>__{general taylor}
<D>__{we have high confidence in the expanded air strike option.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the problem, mr. president, is that it's a short term solution. khruschev can send more missiles next month. the chiefs and i believe we should follow up the air strikes with the full version of oplan 316.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{an invasion...}
<C>__{general taylor}
<D>__{yes, sir. we can be sure we get all the missiles, and we remove castro so this can never happen again.}
<A>__{kenny looks around the room at the men, the murmurs of general agreement, senses the consensus building and is agitated.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{is this the chiefs' recommendation?}
<C>__{general taylor}
<D>__{yes, sir. our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. the invasion happens eight days later.}
<A>__{the president leans back in his chair, turns to the man at the far end of the table: dean acheson, 60s, former secretary of state. he sits silent, like some revered oracle, the architect of the american cold war strategy of containment.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{dean. what do you think?}
<A>__{acheson arches an eyebrow, and when he speaks, his voice resonates throughout the room, powerful, smooth, hypnotic.}
<C>__{acheson}
<D>__{mr. president, you have rightly dismissed the diplomatic option. the soviet will only tie you down in negotiation, and leave us short of our goal, the removal of the missiles. negotiating will do nothing more than give them time to make the missiles operational, complicating the necessary military task we have at hand.}
<A>__{everyone in the room listens to him with rapt attention, his presence overshadowing the room, oracular:}
<C>__{acheson }
<D>__{for the last fifteen years, i have fought here at this table along side your predecessors in the struggle against the soviet. gentlemen, i do not wish to seem melodramatic, but i do wish to impress upon you one observation with all conceivable sincerity. a lesson i have learned with bitter tears and great sacrifice.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the soviet understands only one language: action. it respects only one word: force.}
<A>__{kenny stares at the old man. acheson's gaze finds his through the cigarette smoke. acheson's eyes travel to the president.}
<C>__{acheson }
<D>__{i concur with general taylor. i recommend, sir, air strikes followed by invasion, perhaps preceded by an ultimatum to dismantle the missiles if military necessity permits.}
<A>__{taylor nods, vindicated. the others murmur their approval. bobby, at the table in front of kenny and to his left, trades a dire look with kenny. this is happening too fast. bobby holds his head, looks about at the others, deeply distressed. the president sinks back in his chair, staring at acheson.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{then it appears we have three options. number one. a surgical air strike against the missiles themselves. two, a larger air strike against their air defenses along with the missiles.}
<A>__{kenny eyes bobby. bobby is writing something.}
<C>__{the president }
<D>__{and three, invasion.}
<A>__{bobby looks over his shoulder at kenny, and reaches back to him with a folded note. kenny takes it, opens it. it reads now i know who tojo felt planning pearl harbor.}
<C>__{the president }
<D>__{we're certainly going to do number one; we're going to take out these missiles, so it seems to me we don't have to wait very long. we ought to at least be making those preparations.}
<A>__{kenny gives bobby a curt nod. bobby tilts his head at the president: pass the note on to him. kenny rises, slips the note in front of the president. the president unfolds the note, and we hold on it and his reaction as in the b.g., out of focus, taylor speaks:}
<C>__{general taylor}
<D>__{yes, sir, we're preparing to implement all three options, though i must stress again, sir, there are risks to the strikes without the follow on invasion.}
<A>__{bundy clears his throat. speaks from somewhere down the table.}
<C>__{bundy}
<D>__{you want to be clear, mr. president, that we have definitely decided against a political track.}
<A>__{the president folds the note away, glances at bobby. a beat, the president looks from bobby to acheson.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{dean, how does this play out?}
<C>__{acheson}
<D>__{your first step, sir, will be to demand that the soviet withdraw the missiles within 12 to 24 hours. they will refuse. when they do, you will order the strikes, followed by the invasion. they will resist, but will be overrun. they will retaliate against a target somewhere else in the world, most likely berlin. we will honor our treaty commitments and resist them there, defeating them per our plans.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{those plans call for the use of nuclear weapons.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and what is the next step?}
<A>__{acheson sits back in his chair, smooths his moustache. a dramatic beat, and then his ominous pronouncement rings out:}
<C>__{acheson}
<D>__{hopefully cooler heads will prevail before we reach the next step.}
<A>__{a chill runs down kenny's spine. he looks in shock to the president. the president remains calm. but in place of the fated look the president has had, there's a hesitation.}
