<A>__{a bottle of eric's scotch sits almost empty on the table beside wilder. wilder dozes in a chair facing corbett. corbett is awake. he contorts his body to bring his handcuff chain under his feet and get his hands in front of him. he eyes wilder's .357. it's in a lefty sam browne holster. no way to take it without waking wilder. corbett stands and inches toward the door. as he pulls it open, the insulation makes enough noise to stir wilder. wilder gets up and pushes corbett back into his chair.}

<A>__{wilder's mind clears enough to realize that corbett's hands are in front of him. he reaches for his .357. corbett butts into wilder's midsection with his head. amazingly, wilder stays on his feet. corbett hurries back to the door. wilder lunges, bull determined to hold onto him. corbett smashes wilder across the face with his clenched hands. wilder goes down hard, hitting his head on the table, and stays there. corbett instinctively kneels to see if wilder is still breathing. but then, hearing movement in the rear module, corbett flees.}
