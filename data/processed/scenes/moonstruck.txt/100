<L>__{interior opera house night}
<A>__{the stage the opera is in progress it's the scene in which mimi is standing in the falling snow. she sings to rudolph. it is a beautiful, poignant moment. the snow is falling, falling. mimi is singing her heartbreaking aria of farewell. the lighted tavern window is behind them, glowing with a golden light. we see ronny's face he's staring intently at the stage with shining eyes. he wants to share this moment with loretta, but he is timid she will not feel as he does. we see loretta's face a single tear trails down her cheek. otherwise, she is almost succeeding in hiding that the opera is moving her. she notices ronny's hand creeping towards hers, but makes no move towards it. the stage mimi still singing sadly in the snowfall she and rudolph join hands.}
<B>__{ronny and loretta}
<A>__{grab each other's hand fiercely. at last, they look at each other. she is admitting that she is affected by the opera. he is grateful that she admits it.}
