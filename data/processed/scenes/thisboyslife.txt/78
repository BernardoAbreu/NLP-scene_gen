<L>__{exterior residential neighborhood afternoon}
<A>__{toby, his news bag slung over his shoulder, stands talking idly with two boys from school, oscar booker and jimmy voorhees. one of them says, "uh oh," and jerks his head to indicate where toby and the other boy should look. they look in the direction indicated, and see arthur gayle coming down the road toward them, followed by a small black dog called pepper. as the boys watch arthur's approach:}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{what's his name again?}
<C>__{oscar}
<D>__{arthur gayle.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{what a homo.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{he sure walks like a girl.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{and runs like one and talks like one and throws like one. probably takes a pee like one too just squats right down.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{he smarted off to me the other day told me i was a bourgeois.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{what the frig's a bourgeois?}
<C>__{oscar}
<P>__{(to toby)}
<D>__{call him a sissy.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{oscar}
<D>__{just see what he says.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{yeah, do it.}
<A>__{by this time arthur is next to them. smiling a superior smile, he stops and glances at all three of them as if they were just the oddest things he's ever seen. then his eye falls on toby's yellow hands.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{oh, my, my look at all that yellow: didn't your mama teach you to wash your hands after you pee?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{oh, shut up.}
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(rolls his eyes; heavily sarcastic)}
<D>__{now that's what i like an insult with some originality. did you just make that up? just now? so clever.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{why don't you take a long walk off a short pier?}
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(though he's not}
<D>__{nearly close enough to smell toby's}
<P>__{breath)}
<D>__{excuse me, but has anyone ever told you your breath would gag a maggot?}
<A>__{both of toby's friends laugh.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{well, at least i'm not a great big sissy!}
<A>__{two things happen instantly: the superior smile vanishes from arthur's face, and toby's friends exchange a single expectant look: "here it comes." without warning, arthur swings a fist at toby, catching him on the ear. arthur's second blow hits him in the back of the head. the fight is on. arthur throws punches sidearm, with lots of wrist action, but there are so many of them. before toby can react, arthur has hit him four times, including one wild haymaker that puts toby on his knees. while toby's still on his knees, arthur tries to kick him in the stomach. the kick is deadened by the papers in toby's bag, arthur bends over toby, screaming as if he has lost his mind:}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{get up! get up, you son of a bitching maggot gagger! i will stomp your guts out! i will kill you!}
<A>__{toby gets up, and again arthur sails in with those wild roundhouse swings. then toby gets in a solid punch to arthur's face that rocks the bigger boy back on his heels. arthur grabs his head and roars like a wounded buffalo. almost immediately arthur's eye puffs and begins to swell shut. snot streaming from both nostrils, still roaring, arthur flies at toby again. toby closes with him, to hold those flailing arms still, and the two stagger around the street like drunken dancers. they separate, exchange a few blows, then grapple with each other again. then arthur hooks toby's leg, trips him, and the two roll off the shoulder of the road and down an embankment. they hit the muddy bottom of the gully still hitting, flailing, kicking first toby is on top, then arthur, then toby, then arthur. by now they are panting, each breath is a heave, a gasp. then, suddenly, arthur gives out completely he falls on top of toby, pressing him deeper into the mud. with his last bit of strength toby throws the bigger boy off him and sits up, while pepper barks furiously at him and threatens to nip his leg. toby staggers to his feet and starts to climb the gully. he looks relieved at least it's over. no, it's not. from behind him he hears three words.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{take it back.}
<A>__{toby turns to see a bloody faced, swollen eyed arthur clambering up the hill after him, like some monster that won't die. both boys reach the top and stand facing one another.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{take it back.}
<A>__{arthur's words are not angry anymore. toby's worn out too...}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{say it.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{okay. i take it back.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{no, say 'you're not a sissy.'}
<A>__{toby glances at oscar and jimmy. their faces are gleeful but he doesn't care what the hell they think.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{you're not a sissy.}
<A>__{arthur immediately turns and walks away, but toby ignores them and walks away in the opposite direction, delivering his hated newspapers.}
