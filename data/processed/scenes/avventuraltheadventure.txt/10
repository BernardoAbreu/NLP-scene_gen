<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{anna and sandro have left the group and are ensconced further up among the rocks, on a grassy slope overlooking the beach.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{sandro... a month is too long a time. i have become used to being without you.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{you'll get over it soon. it's the usual anxiety.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{a little more so this time.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{so, it will just take you a little longer to get over it.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{but i think we should talk about it. or are you fully convinced that we too won't understand each other?}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{there will be plenty of time to talk about it later. we'll get married soon. that way we'll have more time...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{in this case, getting married means nothing. aren't we already the same as being married? and corrado and giulia aren't they already the same as being married?}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{but why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... believe me, anna, words never help at all. they only serve to confuse. i love you, anna. isn't i that enough?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no. it's not enough... i told you before that i would like to get away for a while and be alone.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{but you just said that a month was too...}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{i mean, to stay away longer two months... a year... three years... yes, i know, it sounds absurd. and i feel awful. the very idea of losing you makes me want to die... and yet... i... i just don't have the same feeling for you any more.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{and what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{there you go... must you always spoil everything!}
<A>__{she turns and walks away in a rage. sandro breathes a deep sigh, as though the scene had exhausted him, then stretches himself on the ground, his face turned skyward, his eyes shut tight.}
