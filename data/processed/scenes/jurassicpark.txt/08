<L>__{ext lush tropical forest morning}
<A>__{grant takes in the beautiful tropical terrain. this place is the opposite of the badlands. there is elaborate planting everywhere: huge, hairy ferns; exotic, spiked flowers; berries of every color; rushing vines. peeking through the thick greenery are beautiful birds a nd flying squirrels. the strange, prehistoric world impresses grant and ellie. even nedry and gennaro take in the vegetal wonder. then, the sound of men working, grunting from exertion. ahead, muldoon directs a group of workmen. flame throwers roar and machetes fight back the abundant foliage. as they attack a new area, regis waves muldoon over. muldoon has a pronounced limp as he walks over to join them.}
<C>__{ed regis}
<D>__{this is robert muldoon, great african big game hunter. and he's working for us now. doing a bang up job, too.}
<A>__{muldoon rests his rifle by a tree stump and shakes with grant and ellie.}
<C>__{muldoon}
<D>__{ed's a little more bs than pr. mr. gennaro, nice to have you back.}
<A>__{gennaro nods warmly as muldoon limps back to work. regis leads on, taking gennaro's arm and talking to him like and old friend. nedry lumbers in the middle, alone. at the rear, grant and ellie study everything they see. grant calls to regis but is ignored.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{mr. regis, what is the nature of this park?}
<A>__{ellie looks behind and sees cramped ferns spring out to capture the path they just walked on. she nudges grant, who has seen the same.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{aggressive growth, huh?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{hammond's trademark.}
<A>__{a distinct hooting in the distance. then a loud trumpeting. grant and ellie stop. nedry doesn't look up. regis flashes his salesman's smile.}
<C>__{regis}
<D>__{out animals are greeting you!}
<A>__{they pass a crude sign nailed to a tree: welcome to jurassic park. grant cringes at the sign. ellie nudges him to loosen up.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{i hope this isn't one of those animatronic exhibits in a jurassic botanical setting.}
<C>__{nedry}
<D>__{nope.}
<A>__{gennaro wipes his brow. they enter a green tunnel of over arching palm that leads to the visitor's center, a modern complex in the distance. ellie notices a large fence hidden in the brush. she nudges grant. their pov camera slowly climbs a fifteen foot high chain link fence. the needle spiked top of this fence cuts deep into the brush. this fence is only the prelude. sprawling massively above and behind it is a thirty foot high fence. woven throughout the fence's mesh is an intricate system of electrical wire. there is a prominent warning: danger! electric fence: ten thousand volts keep off! camera keeps climbing to the top: ominous barbed wire, curled into the highest growth with coiled razors glistening in the sun. grant strains to understand. the quickens his steps to catch the others. they reach a clearing with an unfinished brick sidewalk and potted shade trees waiting for planting. a crosshatching of tiny lizards scamper off the walk. an empty swimming pool is being filled by a man with a pumper truck. next to him, workers water the large ferns.}
<C>__{regis}
<D>__{i hope you brought your bathing suits! doesn't this mist and these plants really create a bonafide prehistoric feeling?}
<A>__{regis points to a low building with glass pyramids on the roof.}
<C>__{regis}
<D>__{there's the visitor's center.}
<A>__{a crane lowers an iron grating on top of one pyramid. an animal trumpets.}
