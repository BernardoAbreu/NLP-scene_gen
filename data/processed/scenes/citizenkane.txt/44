<L>__{interior thatcher memorial library day }
<A>__{an excruciatingly noble interpretation of mr. thatcher himself executed in expensive marble. he is shown seated on one of those improbable edwin booth chairs and is looking down, his stone eyes fixed on the camera. we move down off of this, showing the impressive pedestal on which the monument is founded. the words, "walter parks thatcher" are prominently and elegantly engraved thereon. immediately below the inscription we encounter, in a medium shot, the person of bertha anderson, an elderly, manish spinnster, seated behind her desk. thompson, his hat in his hand, is standing before her. bertha is on the phone.}
<C>__{bertha}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{yes. i will take him in now.}
<P>__{(hangs up and looks at thompson)}
<D>__{the directors of the thatcher library have asked me to remind you again of the condition under which you may inspect certain portions of mr. thatcher's unpublished memoirs. under no circumstances are direct quotations from his manuscript to be used by you.}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{that's all right.}
<C>__{bertha}
<D>__{you may come with me.}
<A>__{without watching whether he is following her or not, she rises and starts towards a distant and imposingly framed door. thompson, with a bit of a sigh, follows.}
