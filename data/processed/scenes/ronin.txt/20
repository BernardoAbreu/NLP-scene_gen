<A>__{vincent backfists the leader in the nose hitting him so hard that the leader skitters back on unsteady feet and then sits down on his ass. this blow hurt, but the real damage is to the leader's pride. now one of the toughs rushes at sam, only to have sam perform what looks like a jujitsu throw which savagely jerks the tough off his feet and flattens him.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(as if it were an accident)}
<D>__{oh man, i am sorry about that...}
<P>__{(he sticks his hand out)}
<D>__{let me give you a hand.}
<A>__{sam reaches down as if to help the tough, who ignores the hand and totters to his feet. as soon as he's up he turns and runs away, followed by the other toughs. now only the leader is left behind. he looks for a second at vincent and sam, and then turns and runs after his friends. vincent calls after him in french, but whatever he says isn't translated. vincent turns to unlock the car.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what'd you say to him?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i asked if we could give him anything else.}
<A>__{by now the two men are in the car, which starts up and drives off, as it does we }
