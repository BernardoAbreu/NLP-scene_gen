<A>__{in the architecture firm of which peter is one of three partners. the whole staff, about 15 people in all, is gathered around a large model, the project for a big amusement park. they all seem worried about something. jerry, one of peter's partners, seems particularly angry.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{the model's not finished, the blueprints are a mess and you may as well forget the specs, they're a disaster! i know we're talented. i know we're good. then why is it we can never get organized? why is it we're always behind schedule?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{look, jerry, architects since leonardo have always been behind schedule. it's a tradition, for god's sake. why break with tradition?}
<C>__{jerry}
