<L>__{exterior street (somewhere in santa monica) morning}
<A>__{a red ferrari f50 whips around the corner at light speed, screams down the street toward us and screeches to a halt outside the bank. it shifts into reverse and slowly backs over the curb and into the bank. a huge armored bus rolls down the street, through two parked cars, and up onto the sidewalk, effectively sealing off the front of the glass bank. mercs begin welding metal plates around the armored bus. we hear the approaching sirens of a fleet of cop cars.}
