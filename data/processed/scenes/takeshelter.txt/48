<L>__{exterior pump station construction site farmland day}
<A>__{the construction site sits in the middle of open farmland but is considerably more involved than curtis' last job site. dump trucks, backhoes and cement mixers roll and beep across muddy ground. a 20 man crew operates throughout. near the well drilling rig, dewart pushes down a lever that activates the hydraulic lift for the drill. curtis appears behind him.}

<D>__{what you say curtis?}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{not much.}
<A>__{curtis kneels at the ground beside the rig. sifts dirt through his fingers.}
<C>__{dewart}
<D>__{they want us to get a pilot hole drilled by lunch. i figure worse comes to worse we can eat on the rig.}
