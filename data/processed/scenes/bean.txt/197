<L>__{interior grierson gallery. outside men's room day}
<A>__{pause. then out comes bean, drying his empty hands, miming, "sorry, sorry.". we see into the toilet. nothing there. no sign of the painting. bean turns sharply left.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior grierson gallery day}
<A>__{david is talking to bernie in the grounds. we can see the side of the whole gallery in shot as they talk.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{i was hoping du. bean might take a look at my computer project today.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yes. i'11 mention it to him. but ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{howls he getting on with the family?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{ah. fine. it's good. it's great.}
<A>__{we will be slightly distracted by the observation that whistler's mother, america's most valuable painting, is at this moment balanced on a very thin ledge three floors up where bean has put in, outside the men's room window. a bird and then a couple more birds perch on it.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{and howls alison?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{she's ... well, she's good.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers. nice guy. good looking.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yes, isn't he.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{it's great when people who work together can become real friends.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{isn't it?}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{i like to think that's what's happened with you and me ... even though you're kinda my boss. still maybe it won't always be that way, huh?}
<A>__{david doesn't quite see what bernie is getting at but smiles politely. now we see bean's plan he has emerged at a nearby window. he can't reach the painting at first. so he stretches further and further out the window. no good. finally he has to go out on the ledge. he shoos away the birds, who then decide to settle on him instead. finally he gets a hand on the painting. as he does so, he loses hold. he just manages to grabs a window before he falls.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{look, i've left bean on his own. nice to chat though bernie always a subtle joy.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{thanks, david. always a pleasure.}
<A>__{period. bean is slowly managing to claw his way back towards the open window with the painting. it is an extraordinary piece of acrobatics. david turns to go.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{by the way. don't know what you think, mr vice president, but i've been hinting to the old man that someone's got to have the balls to take some sort of emergency measures around here or we're all in the crap house. what do you think?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{'emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?}
<C>__{bernie}
<P>__{not necessarily. that's where this ... ( points to his brain )}
<D>__{comes in. no, i've had a better idea than sacking people. you'll hear soon enough.}
<A>__{bernie grins and walks away. bean does one final swing, and ....}
