<D>__{he said to send you his regards and to tell you that the bureau holds you in the highest esteem.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{what i can't believe is that in an earlier life i slept with him! christ! any god that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button.}

<A>__{she begins to read.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{it's clear he thinks he knows me. he lives a fantasy. 'helen, don't lose your head.' is that a threat? does he want to cut off my head? dahmer cut off heads. who else? kemper. did gacy? rivkind? i think rivkind did.}
