<L>__{interior high school corridor. day, seventeen years earlier.}
<A>__{as with truman's previous flashbacks, this scene appears to be playing on a television screen. however, on this occasion it is also accompanied by christof's comments from his perch in the tower above the park.}
<C>__{christof }
<D>__{he's re created the event on and off for a number of years. we've never understood what prompts him to indulge the fantasy, or for that matter what inspired such a painfully shy boy to approach her in the first place...}
<A>__{a seventeen year old truman, carrying a stack of books, spies lauren, sixteen going on thirty five, wearing the lavender, beaded cardigan at her open locker. she is entertaining two girlfriends with what appears to be a lewd tale.}
<C>__{christof }
<D>__{we'd noticed them making eyes at each other for some weeks but never thought he'd say anything. she was a year older, wrote poetry, way out of his league...}
<A>__{truman, obviously terrified, musters the nerve to approach the lockers. the three girls look up, surprised by the interruption.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(to lauren, tongue tied, a strangled greeting)}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{girlfriend 1}
<P>__{(to lauren as the two girlfriends abruptly depart)}
<D>__{see you in class.}
<A>__{lauren is unsure whether or not to follow her friends.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{lauren, right?}
<A>__{her name is carefully written in blue ink on the covers of her text books.}
<C>__{lauren}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(ignoring her lack of interest)}
<D>__{look. i was wonder }
<C>__{lauren}
<D>__{ i can't go out with you.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{i haven't asked you yet.}
<C>__{lauren}
<D>__{well when you do, that's my answer.}
<P>__{(softening)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. it's not up to me.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(summoning up courage from somewhere)}
<D>__{why, you married?}
<A>__{lauren smiles despite herself.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{i'm not asking you to have my children, just a pizza. how about saturday?}
<C>__{lauren}
<P>__{(adamant)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{friday?}
<A>__{lauren looks around the deserted school corridor.}
<C>__{lauren}
<D>__{now.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{right now? we got finals.}
<C>__{lauren}
<D>__{if we don't go now, it won't happen.}
<A>__{truman hesitates.}
<C>__{lauren}
<P>__{(impatient, looking anxiously around)}
<D>__{well, what do you want to do?}
<A>__{the picture on the television screen suddenly fast forwards at such speed it becomes a blur then returns to normal speed.}
