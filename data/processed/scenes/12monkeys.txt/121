<C>__{astrophysicist}
<D>__{the food, the sky, the certain, uh, sexual temptations you haven't become "addicted" have you, cole? to that "dying" world'}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{no, sir! i just want to do my part. to get us back on top...in charge of the planet. and i have the experience, i know who the people are...}
<C>__{biologist}
<D>__{he really is the most qualified...}
<C>__{geologist}
<D>__{but all that..."behavior"...}

<P>__{(to cole, a little hurt)}
<D>__{you said we weren't "real," cole...}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{well, sir, i don't think the human mind was built to exist in two different... whatever you call it..."dimensions." it's stressful, you said it yourselves, it gets you confused. you don't know what's real and what's not.}
<C>__{microbiologist}
<D>__{but you know what's real now?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{the scientists start to confer openly among themselves}
<C>__{geologist}
<D>__{he'd have to bone up, catch up to our research, the latest clues...}
<C>__{zoologist}
<D>__{he's proved to be a quick study...}

<C>__{astrophysicist}
<D>__{you can't trick us, you know. it wouldn't work.}
<C>__{biologist}
<D>__{and why would you want to? it'll be dangerously close to the end.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i understand. there'd be no pointerior}
<C>__{astrophysicist}
<D>__{we're going to think about it, cole. among ourselves. we'll get back to you.}
