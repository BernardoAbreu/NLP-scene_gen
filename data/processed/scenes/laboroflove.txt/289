<L>__{exterior street day}
<A>__{newspapers spiral through the air. maurice stretches his neck up, squinting at the sun. the silhouette of a helicopter hovers above him. the noise is overpowering. maurice's fatigue grows, every muscle, every ounce of energy goes into each step. maurice clutches the side of his head... the steps halted... hands trembling, teeth clenched, eyes squeezed shut. a surge of intense pain tries to buckle him... maurice fights it off as he moves his feet again. the helicopter swoops above as he makes his turn onto a final stretch of road adjacent to the beach. maurice stops dead in his tracks as he turns the corner to find a sea of people waiting for him. a momentous sight... people lined along the street for as far as the eye can see. an explosion of yelling, cheering californian's engulfs the air as they spot maurice standing at the end of the street. the crowd surges towards him. maurice is dazed... the noise, the pain, the faces swirl in his head as thousands of people surround him. maurice is overwhelmed. he is about to collapse when someone takes hold of his arm. maurice turns to see kris reddy standing next to him. in the midst of this chaos and growing madness. maurice and kris have an entire conversation with one emotional look. the sounds of sirens break the moment. kris turns to see two police cars turn on the street behind them. kris turns to maurice.}
