<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior pipe gallery}
<A>__{outstretched hands in the darkness. reveal peter leaning across the void with one hand while manny and leonard grip his other. susan below, balancing precariously on the crisscrossing pipes. a mess, but still alive. she reaches up to peter. it's too far.}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(a whisper)}
<D>__{don't.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{listen to me: we're getting you out.}
<A>__{leonard and manny pull peter back into}
<L>__{interior tunnels}
<A>__{peter undoes his belt.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(to manny and leonard)}
<D>__{give me your belts.}
<A>__{they obey. peter buckles them together with his. he then loops one end around a bannister, the other around his wrist.}
<C>__{leonard}
<P>__{(to manny, as he ties them together)}
<D>__{what are you doing down here?}
<C>__{manny}
<D>__{chuy. he was taken. he's down here somewhere...}
<P>__{(to peter)}
<D>__{oh, please, hurry. i saw what was after her.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{what's...?}
<C>__{manny}
<D>__{just hurry.}
<A>__{peter takes his word for it. he uses the belts to lower himself to the nearest pipe. leonard lights a flare to illuminate the pipe gallery. peter works his way down. the web of pipes seem to recede into hades. the lifeline tightens. peter gets to the last solid footing, lies down on his stomach and lets the belts down.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i'm coming, sus, i'm coming.}
<A>__{but then, he sees something move below her. then a hollow clang! clang! clang!}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{no, jesus, no.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(to leonard)}
<D>__{toss the flare down!}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{i only got...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{just do it!}
<A>__{leonard lets the flare drop from his hand. it falls past them, ricocheting off the maze of pipes, spinning down to the pitch black below. and for a split second the flame illuminates...}
<B>__{the mimic}
<A>__{pipe in its thorax, nimbly climbing the pipes toward susan clang! clang! clang! peter's eyes grow huge.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{oh, jesus...}
<B>__{leonard}
<A>__{just plain loses it.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{what the fuck is that?! what the fuck is that?!}
<B>__{susan}
<A>__{knows all too well what's coming for her.}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(a desperate appeal)}
<D>__{peter...}
<A>__{throwing caution to the wind, peter reaches the belt down.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{wrap it around your hand!}
<A>__{susan at last gets a grip. peter pulls with both arms. clang! clang! clang! getting closer.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{come on!}
<A>__{susan struggles for footholds on the slippery pipes, ascending foot by foot... peter pulls her into his arms. clang! clang! clang! peter bends down.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{get on my shoulders!}
<A>__{susan steps onto his shoulders. he pushes her up... and leonard and manny yank her out. clang! clang! clang! peter scrambles up, slams the lid back on the hole.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{let's go!}
<A>__{the four of them run. hold on the lid. wham! it bursts from the floor, rolls away like a coin.}
