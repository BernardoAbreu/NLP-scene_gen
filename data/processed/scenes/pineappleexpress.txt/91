<D>__{were they armed?}
<C>__{saul}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<A>__{blam! blam! blam! dale and saul both scramble along a row of weed planets as bullets ricochet all around them. they continue running and then stop.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{i can't hear them.}
<A>__{saul spots an air vent in the middle of the room.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{you could boost me up! we'll sneak out.}
<A>__{blam! blam! they are being shot at again.}
<C>__{dale}

<D>__{lance? holy fuck! you sons of }
<A>__{dale shoots right over saul's shoulder and nails the thug several times.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{holy shit. i killed him.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{about time you killed somebody. you're the one whose supposed to be saving me, and i`ve killed two bad guys already.}
<A>__{saul looks to the vent in the middle of the room. dale looks at the pipe, sizes up saul and himself, and takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{you'll never be able to pull me up, but i will boost you up there and you just fucking run for it, man.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{what? no fucking way, dale. what about you?}

<C>__{dale}
<D>__{don't worry about me.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{whoa. that was awesome.}
<A>__{saul tucks the gun in his belt and awkwardly climbs atop dale's shoulders and tears the vent off.}
<C>__{saul }
<D>__{you're a good man, dale denton.}
<A>__{saul lifts himself in. suddenly, dale sees ted enter the room and immediately go for his gun.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{hold on!}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{wha }
<A>__{dale walks out from under saul, raises his gun, and unloads rata tat tat!!! ted ducks as the plants around him are torn asunder. dale runs out of ammo. blam! blam! blam! ted shoots at saul, who narrowly avoids the gunfire as he pulls himself into the vent. ted redirects his attention to dale, who is running through the bushes. ted blasts off a few shots before dale vanishes into the foliage.}
