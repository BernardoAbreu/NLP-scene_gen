<L>__{interior bathhouse day}
<A>__{above the heat and filth there is a different world. a clean, beautifully tiled world of lazing figures, droning conversations and resonant laughter. it is the hot room of a bathhouse somewhere in the roman empire. we have advanced 4000 years into the future and it shows in the technology. it is men's day at the bathhouse. all of the people relaxing in the water look prosperous and comfortable with themselves. slaves wait in attendance, some around the edge of the pool, others in the water rubbing backs and massaging shoulders. there are three or four times as many slaves as bathers, and the proprie torial way that they look after their masters gives the place the odd atmosphere of a kindergarten for over indulged grown ups. and then we find our hector. he stands against the wall, holding a large towel. although clean shaven and more healthy looking we can still recognize hector, more so by the look in his eyes. there is a set to his face that tells us he is a man alone, emotionally detached from his surroundings. he is a personal body slave. he watches his master in the pool, alert to any hint of need that he might have. hector's master lucinnius is not as relaxed as the others around him. he is in anxious conversation with an older man wading beside him. we don't hear what they are saying but there is enough body language to detect lucinnius' pleading and the older man's cool distraction. the older man gives a final dismissive shake of his head. hector immediately moves to the side of the pool with the towel as lucinnius climbs out of the water.}
