<A>__{max and the boys walking home after the movie, the boys dancing around each other, acting out the fight sequences, all of the sword fighting against max, who battles them all over the street, in and around cars, poomina and amrita looking on shyly, as el max fights to save their honor.}

<D>__{i wish my father loved me like your father loves you. your dad's a very special man. and now, en garde!}
<A>__{as the battle continues, the bright beams of a truck come at them.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{time out, men. off the street till this truck passes.}
<A>__{the kids move toward the wall of the building they're passing, but the truck seems to turn toward them, seem ing not to intend to pass, but to hit them. the look on max's face lets us know he senses something terrible is in the offing here. he shouts for the kids to get out of the way, shoving the kids closest to him into a doorway. he turns to shambu, who's behind him, calls to him. but in a panic, shambu doesn't move into the shelter of the building on his right... but tries to run across the street. max leaps for the little boy too late... as the truck just misses max and clips shambu hard, sending the little boy flying.}
