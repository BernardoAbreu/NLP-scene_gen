<B>__{gerard}
<A>__{climbing the stairs. he reaches a landing and skims shoulders with kimble, who pivots past on his way down. amazingly, neither man reacts. not yet. one flight above, gerard's subconscious taps him on the shoulder and brings him to a dead stop. he leans over the stairwell railing to spy... kimble spiraling downward. from this vantage, it could be any dark haired man. but still...}

<P>__{(a quick probe)}
<D>__{kimble.}
<A>__{others look up out of curiosity... but not kimble. two landings below, he falters a step, then tries to regain his step, keeps moving. but gerard is pulling his glock: the hitch in kimble's stride told him everything.}

<D>__{kimble!}
<A>__{kimble blitzes down the stairs. gerard moves after him.}
