<A>__{obi wan, lama su and taun we come out onto a balcony. below is a huge parade ground. the rain and wind are brutal. thousands of stormtroopers, faces covered by helmets, are marching and drilling in formations of several hundred.}

<L>__{interior tipoca city, clone center, comminssary day}
<A>__{lama su conducts obi wan through a large eating area. taun we follows as they walk by hundreds of clones who look exactly alike, all about twenty years old, dressed in black. they are seated at tables, eating.}
<C>__{lama su}
<D>__{we modified their genetic structure to make them less independent than the original host. as a result they are totally obedient, taking any order without question. obi wam who was the original host?}
<C>__{lama su}
<D>__{a bounty hunter called jango fett. we felt a jedi would be the perfect choice, but sido dyas hand picked jango fett himself. obi wan where is this bounty hunter now?}
<C>__{lama su}
<D>__{oh, we keep him here. after a few hundred thousand clones, the genetic pattern starts to fade, so we take a fresh supply. he lives here, but he's free to come and go as he pleases.}
