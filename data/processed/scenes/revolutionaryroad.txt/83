<L>__{interior vito's log cabin, dance floor night.}
<A>__{april and shep dance. shep can't dance well, but he's trying. april, on the other hand, is a wonderful dancer. she dances out as far as their joined hands allow and does a little twitching, hip bobbing curtsies before twisting back, all seemingly effortless. it is joyous, released.}
<L>__{interior shep's car night.}
<A>__{shep slips behind the wheel and is immediately kissing her, groping.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{let me take you somewhere.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{no. please. here. now. in the back seat.}
<A>__{she climbs into the back seat. he pulls off his jacket and climbs in after her. he folds the jacket under her head for a pillow... she remains perfectly still, allowing him to kiss her, to search under her clothing, to kiss her skin and finally, to lift her skirt and pull her clothing aside and make love to her against the vinyl seat cover... as suddenly as it began, it's over. shep collapses against her. april stares into the darkness.}
<C>__{shep }
<D>__{april... this is what i've always wanted... i love you.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{don't say that.}
<C>__{shep}
<D>__{i mean it, i love you.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{please, just be quiet for a minute, then you can take me home.}
<A>__{they begin to quietly assemble themselves.}
