<L>__{interior harveys bedroom night}
<B>__{a bedroom mirror.}
<A>__{the room is dark. a perfectly square mirror hangs crooked on a wall. suddenly, out of the darkness, the reflection of a man's face comes into focus. he stares straight ahead, perhaps studying his own unrecognizable reflection. it's quite clear this is a portrait of sickness; the man's pallor is gray, his eyes are confused. there is something most definitely wrong. tentatively, the figure steps away from the mirror, leaving the frame empty and dark.}
<B>__{angle on bed}
<A>__{like a ghost, the naked man (harvey) stands over his bed staring down at his sleeping wife (joyce). in the eerie light, he's almost translucent.}
<C>__{harvey}
<P>__{(faintly)}
<D>__{joyce... joyce?}
<A>__{joyce springs up, alarmed.}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{what's wrong, harvey? what are you doing up?}
<A>__{harvey just stands there for a moment saying nothing.}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{harvey}
<P>__{(delirious, out of breath)}
<D>__{tell me the truth. am i some guy who writes about himself in a comic book? or am i just am i just a character in that book?}
<A>__{joyce rubs her eyes.}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{harvey...}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{if i die, will 'dat character keep goin'? or will he just fade away...}
<A>__{joyce just stares at him, unsure how to answer. suddenly harvey collapses. joyce leaps from the bed, nervous, hysterical. she gets down on the floor and shakes him.}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{omigod, harvey! harvey, wake up!}
<A>__{close on harvey's face his eyes remain closed, his expression far, far away.}
