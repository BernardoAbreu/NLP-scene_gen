<A>__{she looks down and then begins to half whisper, sing, and half do all of the gestures for a song she has written as she wipes some glasses. the jukebox continues to play connie white, and every time someone walks by, sueleen stops. she finally gets through the song and discovers reese has been watching, too. she looks away from him to the tricycle man, who smiles. be has finished his meal.}
