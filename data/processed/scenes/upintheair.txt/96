<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{the screen of natalie's cell phone text reads: "i think it's time we c other people"}
<L>__{interior bar lounge miami hilton moments later}
<A>__{the three share a booth. natalie is sipping a drink. she seems to have settled a little.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{he broke up with you over text message?}
<C>__{ryan}
<P>__{(soft dig)}
<D>__{that's kind of like firing people over the internet.}
<A>__{both natalie and alex shoot ryan a look.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(re: the ex boyfriend)}
<D>__{what a weasely prick.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{yeah, but what does that make me? someone who falls for a prick?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{we all fall for them. pricks are spontaneous, unpredictable, and fun. and then we're surprised when they turn out to be pricks.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{i followed him to omaha.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{you did?}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{i had a job waiting for me in san fran, when he got an offer from conagra. he told me we could start a life together. so i followed him.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{to nebraska.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{i look in the mirror and i just see compromise... i'm supposed to do something.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you'll do plenty.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{i just can't... i thought i'd be engaged by now.}
<P>__{(catches herself)}
<D>__{no offense.}
<C>__{alex ryan}
<A>__{it's alright. none taken.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{when i was sixteen, i thought by twenty three, i would be married, maybe have a kid... corner office by day, entertaining at night. i was supposed to be driving a grand cherokee by now.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{life can underwhelm you that way.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{now i have my sights on twenty nine, because thirty is just way too... apocalyptic. i mean, where did you think you'd be by...}
<A>__{natalie catches herself, having no idea how old alex is.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{it doesn't work that way.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{at a certain point, you stop with the deadlines.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{they can be a little counterproductive.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{i don't want to say anything that's... anti feminist. i mean, i really appreciate everything your generation did for me.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(my generation?)}
<D>__{it was our pleasure.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{well done.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{but sometimes it feels like no matter how much success i have, it all won't matter until i find the right guy.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you really thought this guy was the one.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{yeah, i guess. i don't know. i could have made it work. he just really fit the bill.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{the bill?}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{my type. you know, white collar. college grad. loves dogs. likes funny movies. six foot one. brown hair. kind eyes. works in finance but is outdoorsy, you know, on the weekends.}
<P>__{(we think she's done)}
<D>__{i always imagined he'd have a single syllable name like matt or john or... dave. in a perfect world, he drives a four runner and the only thing he loves more than me is his golden lab. oh... and a nice smile.}
<P>__{(back to alex and ryan)}
<D>__{how about you?}
<A>__{this catches both alex and ryan off guard.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i'm not sure if...}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{i meant alex...}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{huh, let me think for a sec.}
<P>__{(mulls it over)}
<D>__{well, by the time you're thirty four, all the physical requirements are pretty much out the window. i mean you secretly prey he'll be taller than you.}
<A>__{ryan smiles.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{not an asshole would be nice? just someone who enjoys my company. comes from a good family you don't think about that when you're younger.}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{wants kids... likes kids...}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{wants kids. healthy enough to play catch with his future son one day.}
<A>__{we can tell ryan is taking a serious interest in this.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{please let him earn more than i do. that doesn't make sense now, but believe me, it will one day. otherwise it's just a recipe for disaster.}
<P>__{(reaching)}
<D>__{hopefully some hair on his head...? but it's not exactly a deal breaker anymore. nice smile... yep, a nice smile just might do it.}
<A>__{alex looks to ryan. he has a nice smile.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{wow. that was depressing.}
<A>__{alex and ryan react it's not that bad.}
<C>__{natalie }
<D>__{i should just date lesbians.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{tried it. we're no picnic ourselves.}
<A>__{natalie looks worse than when the conversation started.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{i don't mind being married to my career, and i don't expect it to hold me in bed as i fall asleep.}
<P>__{(looks up)}
<D>__{i just don't want to settle.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you're young. right now you see settling as some sort of failure.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{it is. by definition.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{don't worry, by the time someone is right for you, it won't feel like settling... and the only person left to judge you will be the twenty four year old girl with a target on your back.}
<A>__{natalie cracks a smile. ryan looks to alex. they've grown closer.}
