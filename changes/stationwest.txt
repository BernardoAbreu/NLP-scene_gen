<ACTION>__{The sky is pure blue, exquisitely blemished by huge cumulus clouds, floating lazily. A single bird sails past. From the sky the CAMERA MOVES TO earth. Here, too, all is tranquil. The trees, bright green in the sunlight, move only to the slight but constant breeze. Now the CAMERA MOVES DOWN, revealing a wagon to which is hitched a team of horses beside the road. The wagon is at an awkward angle, but upright. It is wedged between two rocks where the horses have pulled it as they tried to reach some forage. Its seat is empty. In the bed of the wagon several sacks lie, bearing the legend:}
<DIAL>__{From: Argus Mine - Rock Pass To: U.S. Assay Office San Francisco}
<ACTION>__{The sacks are empty and slashed as by a knife. The ropes that bound them are cleanly severed. The disorder in the wagon indicates haste. Two horses are hitched to it, munching grass or the high leaves of a tree overhead. All that is odd or unnatural is that the reins have fallen askew and trail the ground. Now the CAMERA MOVES AWAY and ALONG tracks made by the wagon when it left the road. ON THE ROAD two horses stand. These are saddled, but riderless. The rifle holsters are empty. CAMERA MOVES TO the ground. There on the road lies the rifle. The dust is slightly blowing across it, moved by the persistent summery little breeze. From the rifle, the CAMERA MOVES ON A LITTLE and STOPS ABRUPTLY ON the sprawled dead figure of a soldier, then another, face down in the road. CLOSE SHOT of the dead soldiers, as the CAMERA HOLDS ON them. Near the hand of one a revolver lies, the fine dust coating it. Dust blowing over the uniforms, as though seeking to hide the shame of a murder. As it blows over their still figures, the SOUND of BIRDS coming over:}
<TRANS>__{FADE OUT: FADE IN:}
<ACTION>__{ROCK PASS - NIGHT This is a western mining town of the Eighties that has mushroomed up around a gold strike. On the streets prospectors and miners mingle with merchants. As the CAMERA PICKS UP the scene, a lumber wagon passes, bearing logs, a ten team wagon, its trailer filled with ore from the stamp mills and bearing the legend: ARGUS MINE. A stage coach comes in as we:}

<LOC>__{INT. HOTEL - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{On the hotel clerk, as he sits behind the desk, playing a guitar and singing pensively the ballad of the story. As he sings, JOHN HAVEN, newly arrived on the stagecoach, walks in, gazes at the clerk with a slight smile, finding the clerk completely indifferent to the arrival of anybody, at last leaves the bag and saunters out.}
<TRANS>__{DISSOLVE:}
<LOC>__{EXT. SALOON - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{As Haven leaves the hotel and has reached the saloon, a well- lighted, plush-looking spot, illumined by kerosene flares. Sticking a pipe in his mouth, Haven saunters in.}
<LOC>__{INT. CHARLIE'S SALOON - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{It is a huge elaborate room, lit by overhead chandeliers. A long mahogany bar runs the length of it. To one side there is a big stove and the gambling tables. Beyond can be seen pool tables in an alcove. To another side, a man grinds away at a piano. A stairway near the end of the bar leads to an upper floor. The place is crowded and noisy with people. Haven saunters towards the dice table, pauses, watches; he is looking the crowd over carefully -- missing no detail of the place or the people in it. When his turn comes, he picks up the dice, bets all over the place -- on the line, on the odds, on the seven, then on the come, the hard way, etc. His point is eight.}
<CHAR>__{STICKMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Eight the hard way! Pay the line!}
<ACTION>__{Haven bets again, doubling all over the table.}
<CHAR>__{STICKMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Seven a winner.}
<ACTION>__{Players glance at the newcomer. Prince appears from nowhere, standing behind the stickman, watching. Prince is slender, black-haired, handsome and impassive. Haven throws again. Stellman, an Army officer, watches curiously. There is a little rising murmur as Haven tosses another natural. He does it without enthusiasm or any lost movement. The bettors get down on him. Prince touches the stickman's arm; the man stands aside and Prince takes his place with the stick. Prince tosses the dice back to Haven. Haven's eyes are fixed on him. With a little smile, Haven throws the dice to the next man, picks up his winnings.}
<CHAR>__{HAVEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No, thanks...}
<ACTION>__{His eyes meet Prince's again and then he turns away, Prince's gaze following him curiously, Stellman looks at Prince.}
<CHAR>__{STELLMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Know him?}
<CHAR>__{PRINCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No. Why?}
<CHAR>__{STELLMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{He just seems kind of free with that money.}
<ACTION>__{CAMERA FOLLOWS Haven, as still smiling slightly, he heads towards the bar, searching the faces of the crowd as he goes. Two miners are squared off for a fight and Haven, going his way, walks between them, very indifferent, not even glancing back at the SOUND of scuffle behind him. AT THE BAR - Haven alone is not watching the fight. All the others have turned to see it; even the barman is busy watching. But Haven's eyes are resting on the figure of a woman now at the piano, singing. Softly, as if to herself and for her own enjoyment. He is near the end of the bar and near the piano, and since no one else listens to her at this moment, she sings, half smiling, directly for him, and then, self-consciously, she stops and turns to sit at a table, as Haven watches her. Behind them the fight is being stopped and Charlie's eyes follow the huge bouncer, Mick Marion, as he drags the offenders out to the door and the street. All is as usual. The bartender is back at work. As Haven turns, he finds that the place beside him is now occupied by the young Lieutenant (Phil Stellman). Haven glances at the uniform, then at the pleasant face of the officer, as the barman comes up.}

<CHAR>__{HAVEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Not till after the first one.}
<ACTION>__{He turns his back to her; she gives him a look and saunters off. The barman produces the drinks -- a beer for Stellman, the young officer. The barman folds his arms. Stellman looks at Haven.}

<CHAR>__{BARMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{On the bottle it says Rye -- but the way you take it, I don't see what difference it makes.}
<ACTION>__{Haven smiles at him.}
<CHAR>__{HAVEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Another Rye.}
<ACTION>__{The barman turns to get it. Stellman is still looking at Haven.}

<DIAL>__{Got a job?}
<ACTION>__{The barman gives Haven another Rye.}
<CHAR>__{HAVEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Listen, soldier. I know that one, too. Got a job, stranger? No? Why don't you join the Army? Three meals a day, a place to sleep, a nice warm uniform --}
<CHAR>__{STELLMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It has a little more than that.}
<CHAR>__{HAVEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(deliberately)}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, it has one thing more, and that's what I could never take --}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(looking at Stellman's stripes)}
<DIAL>__{It's got Second-Lieutenants.}
<ACTION>__{The barman, listening, senses trouble and signals with his eyes to a big bouncer down the bar. The bouncer moves up quietly.}

<DIAL>__{If you want to make it a personal matter --}
<CHAR>__{HAVEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(coldly)}
<DIAL>__{I don't make it anything, soldier. You tried to sell something and I didn't buy it -- so why don't you just beat it?}
<ACTION>__{They stare at each other for a long second, then Stellman speaks icily:}
<CHAR>__{STELLMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{If I weren't in uniform, I might teach you some manners.}
<CHAR>__{HAVEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{If you could teach me anything, you wouldn't be in a uniform.}
<ACTION>__{Stellman's jaw tightens; then he turns and exits abruptly. The barman sighs with relief; the bouncer turns away.}
<CHAR>__{BARMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You couldn't be looking for trouble, could you?}
<CHAR>__{HAVEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I could, but I'm not.}
<CHAR>__{BARMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's fine, because this is one of the best places West of the Atlantic Ocean to find it.}
<CHAR>__{HAVEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That was my first impression.}
<CHAR>__{BARMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(as Haven looks at him)}
<DIAL>__{That Lieutenant's a nice young boy.}
<CHAR>__{HAVEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't doubt it, but his mouth is too big -- like your ears.}
<ACTION>__{He turns away from the bar, after flipping a coin on to it, while the barman stands there not knowing whether to be angry or philosophical. CAMERA FOLLOWS Haven, as he threads his way through the tables towards the door. His eyes catch sight of the girl who sang at the piano, Charlie. She is sitting at a table with Prince. Prince murmurs to her and she glances at Haven, then looks away again. Haven notes it. As he comes near the table, the blonde who spoke to him at the bar, accosts him again.}
<CHAR>__{BLONDE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{How is it now?}
<CHAR>__{HAVEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What?}
<CHAR>__{BLONDE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Drinking alone?}
<CHAR>__{HAVEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(flipping her a coin)}
<DIAL>__{It's all right -- try it.}
<ACTION>__{Haven is looking at Charlie. She is checking a stack of coins the blonde has turned in to her. She glances up with a fleeting smile at Haven.}
<CHAR>__{CHARLIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's not a good habit if it makes you pick fights.}
<CHAR>__{HAVEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Only with Second Lieutenants.}
<CHAR>__{CHARLIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We like Second Lieutenants here.}
<ACTION>__{Their gazes meet and Prince notes it with narrowing eyes. The gaze holds like a spell, and then Charlie's smile comes back, from nowhere.}
<CHAR>__{CHARLIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You see -- here everybody fights, except the Army.}
<ACTION>__{Haven looks at her, fascinated. She can feel a fascination herself. Now Haven smiles a little.}
<CHAR>__{HAVEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I wouldn't know --}
<CHAR>__{CHARLIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(still smiling)}
<DIAL>__{So anyone who doesn't like the Army --}
<CHAR>__{HAVEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I know what you mean, but I'm afraid I'll have to come back. I like the way you sing.}
<ACTION>__{She looks at him in a second's silence. Haven turns and leaves. She watches him go. Prince studies her face, his own grim. A croupier comes up and places a paper before her. She hardly notices it.}
<CHAR>__{CROUPIER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Okay, Charlie?}
<ACTION>__{Charlie snaps out of it long enough to initial the paper.}
<CHAR>__{CHARLIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's his limit.}
<CHAR>__{CROUPIER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{There's a sucker getting hot with the dice at Ed's table.}
<ACTION>__{He turns away. Prince sits still, his eyes on Charlie, his slim fingers at an habitual trick, that of idly stacking dice in a little pillar and then picking the pillar aloft by holding the lowest dice pinched between the thumb and forefinger, NOT by the edges, but by the sides. Now he does it as he watches Charlie's face. Her eyes glance again at the disappearing back of Haven. The sense of fascination seems to have gotten her, too. Then she realizes the presence of Prince and his shrewd gaze. She looks at him coolly.}
<CHAR>__{CHARLIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well -- cool him off.}
<ACTION>__{Prince flips the dice into his palm and rises...}
<LOC>__{EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The board sidewalk has given way to a rutty dirt road. Now the racket of the saloon street is just a ghost of noise, the road dark and silent. Haven has emerged from the saloon. He glances up the street. Fifty yards ahead, Stellman is walking slowly. Stellman pauses, shoots a quick glance backwards, then goes on. Haven follows, going leisurely up the street after Stellman. ANGLE on a corner as Stellman turns it, pauses and waits. When Haven reaches it, Stellman goes on in silence.}
<LOC>__{EXT. MRS. CASLON'S MINE-CABIN - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{As Stellman reaches it, pauses and glances behind him. Then he rings a bell. Haven comes up and waits in silence, glancing at the dark interior. A woman's face now peers through the door window and then the door opens. Stellman enters quickly and Haven follows.}
<LOC>__{INT. MRS. CASLON'S MINE-CABIN - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{As Stellman and Haven follow Mrs. Caslon to a rear door. Looking around, Haven notes in the shadows a desk and in a corner the big safe. (This room is described in a subsequent scene.) So as to emit the least light, Mrs. Caslon lets Stellman and Haven go through, then quickly follows them and quickly shuts the door.}
<LOC>__{INT. MRS. CASLON'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{It is remarkably neat and elegant inside. As Haven, glancing around, pauses inside, he finds himself facing a burly uniformed cavalry officer, captain's bars gleaming on the side of his collar. The captain is big and broad and scowling. He is standing by the fireplace and his eyes are boring into Haven's with curiosity and perhaps, suspicion. Stellman steps forward as Haven and the captain are measuring each other.}

<CHAR>__{ILES} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Then why is M.I.D. sending you out here?}

<ACTION>__{As Mick closes again, Haven stops quickly to one side, clipping him behind the ear as he goes by. But this time Mick keeps after Haven and finally connects. It is more of a push than a clean hit, but even so the force of it drives Haven off balance and he sprawls on his back. As Mick, sensing victory, charges, Haven knows he can't get to his feet in time, so he turns his body and springs at Mick's knees shoulder first. The impact spills Mick on his face; before he can recover, Haven dives on him, hands flat on his own chest and palms turned out. His body crashes heavily, angling across Mick's head, and Haven's savagely pushing hands mash the other man's face into the hard ground. Then he rolls clear and comes to his feet, breathing easily, waiting. Mick gets up, shaking his head to clear it, mad and hurt. As he closes ponderously in on Haven, his booted foot suddenly shoots out. Haven twists his knee cap away but takes the blow on the inside of his thigh, numbing the leg so that he almost goes down. And now Mick gets to him. His great arms close around Haven's waist, his hands locked in the small of Haven's back. Haven braces himself against the crushing squeeze, tensing his back muscles and stiffening his spine, but there is nothing he can do against the implacable brute power of the other man. The sweat stands out on Haven's face as Mick's great strength bends him over farther and farther. He must do something, and soon, or his back will be cracked like a barrel stave. Suddenly he bends his knees and lifts his feet up from off the ground. Mick, suddenly finding Haven's full weight pulling him forward, crashes down on top of him. With all the strength left in him, Haven brings his knee to the pit of Mick's stomach; as Mick's hold breaks, Haven rolls clear. Now they are both hurt. Haven's ribs and chest are so bruised that it is agony to take a breath. He knows it has to end quickly or he is done for, and he goes all out. As Mick tries to close with him again, he stands his ground and throws pile-driver punches to Mick's midsection; as Mick finally lowers his arms to cover his body, Haven shifts his attack to the face. This is not Mick's style of fighting, but as he lashes back clumsily and angrily, each time he touches Haven it is with punishing power. Toe to toe, they slug it out, the belt now unwound and dangling from Mick's fist, both men groggy but both refusing to go down. Finally Mick is helpless to protect himself, but Haven hasn't got power left to knock him off those sturdy legs. Gathering himself, Haven hurls his body shoulder first at Mick's chest but he miscalculates, glances off and falls flat on his face. As he rolls over, dogged and slow with exhaustion, he sees that his weight has staggered Mick; the big man has taken a step back, and now he starts to walk forward. Dazed and blind with pain, he passes Haven, staggers forward until the tie-rail stops him. There he stands, his hands on the rail, moving his head from side to side like a wounded animal. The crowd is silent now, waiting. Haven gets to his feet, drunk with weariness. He puts a hand on Mick's shoulder, but hasn't the strength to whirl him around. He braces himself with one hand against the tie-rail, and almost in slow motion pulls Mick around and clips him one last time with his remaining strength. Mick goes down.}

CAMERA FOLLOWS Haven as he moves slowly. He has replaced the gun, but he is alert. ANGLE ON Prince as he watches Haven, now a perfect target, not looking in his direction. Prince raises the gun a little, but the dice in his over hand click ever so faintly. SHOT OF Haven as he stops dead in his tracks, hand on the gun again, alert at the slight sound of the dice. Now facing towards the shadow where Prince is hidden. He stands ready and rigid for a long still moment. When there is no further sound or movement, he goes on towards the stairs. ANGLE ON Prince as he moves slightly from the shadow as Haven goes to the stairs. Prince is ready to shoot again, but now the angle on Haven up the stairs is no good. He lowers the gun with disgust, then moves softly out of the shadow.}

<ACTION>__{At the bare rustle of SOUND behind him (and the memory of her eyes going past him) Haven whirls, stopping aside and drawing as he does so. And just as he does so, Prince, in the doorway, fires. Haven shoots so that the shots RING OUT almost simultaneously. Prince topples forward on his knees and then his face. The dice roll out of his unclenched left hand. MED. SHOT of Haven and Charlie as their eyes read the dice. Haven puts away the gun. Charlie is still leaning against the desk, but there is a strange look on her face. A thin smile for Haven. Now she sags a little and Haven realizes she has been hit. He starts to her and she turns away towards the couch. He catches her as she sags again, and helps her down gently on the couch. ANGLE on couch as Haven kneels beside her. He starts to pull away the top of her dress, but the wound is close to the heart. She shakes her head.}
