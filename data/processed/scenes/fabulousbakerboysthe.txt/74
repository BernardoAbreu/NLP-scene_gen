<L>__{interior dining room night}
<A>__{that evening. the trio has just finished a song and those on the dance floor are clapping.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{thank you. you know, before we came out here this evening, susie and jack and i were looking over your dedications and something struck us.}
<A>__{susie and jack look at frank as if they have no idea what he's talking about.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{we realized that, well, we're really not so different from one another after all. oh sure, we may be at different points in our journey, but we all travel pretty much the same road. and so, with that in mind, we'd like to introduce you to two very special couples. first, married for all of two days, please say hello to helen and bud wilson. helen. bud.}
<A>__{those standing on the dance floor applaud as the young couple from the beat up eldorado make their way to the front of the room.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{and now, our second couple. i'm talking about ethel and bert lane, ladies and gentlemen. now, ethel and bert would be upset with me if i told you they'd been married for fifty years. why? because, ladies and gentlemen, ethel and bert lane have been married for seventy five years!}
<A>__{the audience lets go with an audible "ooh" and applauds enthusiastically.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{ethel, bert. get up here and show these kids how it's done.}
<A>__{a path is cleared and a tiny couple begins to make their way to the dance floor.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{aren't they a sight?}
<A>__{they are indeed, and a sight slower getting to the dance floor than frank anticipated. he nods to jack and they launch into "the anniversary waltz," but have to keep repeating the opening passage while they wait for ethel and bert. finally, everyone on the dance floor steps back and, with some help from a few waiters, who slide a section of tables out of the way, ethel and bert lane begin to dance in the center of the room, slowly but wonderfully, while the younger couple whirls around them like a youthful satellite.}
