<L>__{exterior the wagon dawn}
<A>__{percy has spread out the broken scenery assessing the damage. in the shadow of the wagon valentina is changing tony's dressings.}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{thank god it's only cuts and bruises. i thought we'd lost you.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{if you hadn't been there...}
<A>__{he holds her hand. looks deep into her eyes.}
<C>__{tony }
<D>__{valentina, your father seems in a terrible state. is it the police? the show? maybe i can help.}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{i don't know what's wrong with him, but if it's about the show...i don't care. i'm tired of it...let the police arrest us. i'm sick of living like this....}
<A>__{she looks miserable. tony puts his arms around her. holds her tightly to him.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{don't say that. what you're doing is important. really important. it's just... maybe... it should be done in a different way.}
<A>__{he is about to kiss her.}
<D>__{doctor parnassus o s what sort of "different" way do you suggest?}
<A>__{dr. parnassus, grim faced, head bandaged, steps from behind the wagon. tony and valentina quickly disengage.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{oh, hello, good morning sir. how are you feeling? that was a nasty bump on the head you got.. doctor parnassus o s}
<P>__{(beady eyed)}
<D>__{"different?"}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{well, sir, i've been thinking... it's clear the show's not attracting many people. forgive me but... i see two ways of tackling this problem.}
<C>__{tony }
<D>__{either the style of the show is at fault... or the type of audience. i would suggest changing both.}
<A>__{percy has appeared, dragging a damaged flat.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{change the show!? who the fizzing hell do you think you are?......}
<C>__{doctor parnassus}
<D>__{shhh!}
<A>__{he sits down heavily.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{i'm sorry but.. you're not modern. people want modern. look.}
<A>__{he holds open a tattered fashion magazine to a page of beautifully photographed models in a fabulously magical setting. he thumbs through more pages of dreamy images.}
<C>__{tony }
<D>__{this is modern. it works. trust me, i understand this world.}
<P>__{(with a wink)}
<D>__{this kind of mind control. let's try to meet the public halfway.. the right public.. and in a better part of town.}
<A>__{from behind the wagon anton watches forlornly. alone and unnoticed by the others.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{what about the filth?}
<C>__{tony}
<P>__{(puzzled)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{the filth. the police.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{there'll be a better class of police too.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{that'll be the day.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{the trick is not to hide. change your colours. be bold. go where they would least expect to find you. i think we have been brought together for a reason. i don't believe in coincidence. you saved my life. now let me do something in return.}
<A>__{parnassus confers with percy.}
<C>__{doctor parnassus}
<D>__{our time's nearly up... this could be what we need.}
<C>__{tony}
<P>__{(to valentina)}
<D>__{this can be my birthday gift to valentina.}
<A>__{valentina smiles and nods to parnassus.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{well then...}
<P>__{(with a burst of energy)}
<D>__{for god's sake let's do it!!!}
<C>__{percy}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{yeah, okay, but what exactly do we do?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{well... first of all, i want you to give me your money. all of it.}
<A>__{what?! parnassus, percy, and valentina look at each other. then parnassus sees something beyond the wagon...anton, downcast, heading off through the swirling plastic bags and flying rubbish... a battered suitcase in his hand.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{anton! where are you going?}
<A>__{no answer from anton. valentina runs after him but, he marches on silently.}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{what are you doing? didn't you do enough damage last night?}
<P>__{(pummmelling his back)}
<D>__{anton... i'm the one who wants to run away!}
<P>__{(he slows)}
<D>__{are you trying to wreck my birthday, or what?}
<A>__{anton stops, still not looking at valentina he slowly drops his suitcase.}
<C>__{valentina }
<D>__{please. we need you.}
<A>__{moved, anton turns to her. she smiles sweetly.}
<C>__{valentina }
<D>__{how much money have you got?}
