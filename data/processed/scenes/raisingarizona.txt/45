<D>__{you know what's goin' on, h.i. it's just business. now this can go either hard or easy }
<A>__{hi gives gale a hard push to get past him. gale staggers back but recovers and grabs hi in a bear hug. hi flips gale. gale lands on a coffee table which flips up and crashes back down. evelle is dancing back out of hi's reach. as hi lunges for him the prostrate gale grabs his legs. hi goes down hard. gale leaps to his feet and crash bangs his head up against an overhanging lamp. both of his hands fly up to massage the top of his head. thoomp hi's fist flies into frame to connect with gale's unguarded stomach. gale doubles over, clutching at his gut. hi interlaces his fingers to make a club of his two hands. with gale's bowed head a target in front of him, hi swings his hands up over his head. hi's knuckles scrape painfully against the plaster of the too low ceiling. skin is flayed, plaster crumbles. hi grabs at his knuckles in pain. gale lunges with a mid body tackle that sends hi crashing into the wall. gale, still on top of him, reaches back to throw a punch. the reach back sends his elbow crashing through a window but doesn't stop the punch. it connects with hi's jaw. gale throws another quick punch, all his weight behind it. hi's head bobs sideways just in time and gale's fist goes through the wall. it is momentarily stuck there. hi uses the opportunity to grab gale's one free arm with both of his. he is twisting it to make gale, roaring with pain, twist around and present his back to him. hi climbs aboard, grabbing gale's face. gale, still roaring, is pulling his fist out of the hole. he grabs a lath exposed by the hole and pulls; it tears out of the wall and snaps free, giving him a length of about two feet. gale is rampaging around like a grizzly bear hemmed in a too small space. hi is hanging on for dear life, his own feet flailing this way and that, knocking over lamps and wall fixtures as gale bends and twirls about, trying to shake him loose. gale crashes and bounces off the walls, roaring in pain and fury. close shots of gale's face show his features impossibly and grotesquely contorted by hi's hand, squeezing, gripping and clutching at it. evelle is dancing around with the baby, dodging crashing furniture and flailing body parts.}
