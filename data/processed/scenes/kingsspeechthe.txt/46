<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{you look dreadful.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{another example of exactly the sort of thing you don't say to a royal. and you're too close.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{but you're not royal in this room.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{which is precisely why elizabeth dislikes you.}
<A>__{he starts to sit.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{not there!}
<A>__{crunch. a model airplane was nestling in the armchair.}
<C>__{lionel }

<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{you don't have any money. i will fix it. so, bertie, what brings you here? your father's death?}
<A>__{bertie is silent.}

<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{what was he angry about?}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{i was a great disappointment.}

<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{so did i.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{a man of stature?}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{a clerk.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{oh.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<C>__{bertie }
<D>__{i was informed, after the fact, my father's last words were: "bertie has more guts than the rest of his brothers put together."}

<D>__{sing it.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{certainly not.}
<P>__{(fascinated by the plane repairs)}
<D>__{may i help? always wanted to build models. father wouldn't allow it. i had to collect stamps. he collected stamps.}

<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{you can with me.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{that's because you're peculiar.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{i take that as a compliment. cut some struts from the balsa. sorry, hard to show you what to do at five paces. would you like a cup of tea?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{no. yes. thank you.}
<A>__{lionel fires up the hot plate.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{you were about to sing an aria concerning your brother.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i'm not crooning to the tune of "swanee river!"}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{try "camptown races" then.}
<P>__{(sings)}
<D>__{"the arch of c, he said to me, doo dah doo dah..." that sort of thing.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i can't talk, or sing, about your future king, doo dah, doo dah...}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{my future king? he's your future king too. did that cause friction? knowing he'd grow up to be king, but you wouldn't.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{certainly not. i've always looked up to david. water's boiling.}
<A>__{lionel makes the pot.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{two lumps or one?}
<A>__{bertie, a bit abashed, holds up three fingers.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i've a sweet tooth. to tell the truth...}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{always preferable.}
<P>__{(referring to plane wing)}
<D>__{cover it with tissue.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{...it was a relief. knowing i wouldn't be king.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{why's that?}
<A>__{lionel hands him a mug of tea. bertie realizes it's chipped and possibly none too clean.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i wouldn't have to give speeches!}
<A>__{reaches into his jacket for his cigarette case.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{no smoking. what's the age difference?}
<A>__{while logue isn't looking, bertie surreptitiously wipes the rim of the mug with his handkerchief.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{eighteen months.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{but for eighteen months you would've been king?!}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{we didn't think about it that way, doctor.}
<P>__{(sings)}
<D>__{doo dah doo dah.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{david and i were very close.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{as you said: eighteen months.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{as brothers!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{how close?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{young bucks... you know.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{i don't, or i wouldn't ask. did you go after the same girls?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{upon occasion.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{princess elizabeth?}
<C>__{bertie}
<P>__{(flares)}
<D>__{what an extraordinarily rude thing to say!}
<P>__{(quickly under control)}
<D>__{david did try to be her beau at one pointerior before i met her. she wouldn't have him.}
<C>__{bertie }
<D>__{not like my father...he and his brother, when they were young, kept a girl in st john's wood and shared her on alternate nights.}
<A>__{an uncomfortable silence. too much has been said.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{now dope the other wing. did david tease you?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{they all did. "buh buh buh bertie". father encouraged it. "spit it out, boy!" thought it would make me stop. is this necessary?!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{otherwise the paint will eat through the tissue.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i mean the damn questions!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{mandatory. tell me more about your storybook childhood. what was your earliest memory?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{you asked that before.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{this time i'd like an answer.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{being born.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{how can you remember that?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{december 14th.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{"mausoleum day". prince albert departed on that date. i was named bertie to placate great grandmamma victoria. in return, she hated me because it reminded her of her grief.}
<P>__{(stutter growing in intensity)}
<C>__{bertie }
<D>__{let's stick to medical history please. i'm naturally left handed, which was considered inappropriate.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{and?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i was punished. now i'm right handed.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{anything else?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{bandy legs. also considered inappropriate.}
<A>__{lionel waits.}
<C>__{bertie }
<D>__{metal splints were made...worn night and day...very painful. now i have straight legs. this is so...tawdry! i need your services as a speech therapist, not grand inquisitor. are you available? or will it be: "myrtle says no?"}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{you sound angry.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{yes, i told you, i have a temper.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{angry at me, or at your brother?}
<A>__{bertie remains stubbornly silent. then blurts:}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{he's fallen in love!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{how dreadful.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{with the wrong sort of woman!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{what's wrong with her?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{she's american.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{some of them must be lovable.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{this one's divorced. twice. mrs wallis simpson of baltimore. i want david to be happy, but the family, the church, the nation, won't have it.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{can't they fornicate privately like adults?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{if only! david used to prefer married women because there was no possible attachment. but now...}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{"queen wallis of baltimore"?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{please.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{does sound a bit iffy.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i made a smudge!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{touch it up.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{you want me to beg for help?}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{i advise you never to beg. especially if you might be king.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{don't say that!}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{i see. for reasons you cannot disclose, fearing ramifications you will not explain, you feel sufficiently anxious to embark upon a course of therapy in which you have no faith? you already owe me a shilling.}
<A>__{bertie takes a coin out of his pocket, hesitates, then offers it to logue.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i brought it along. you won, fair and square. i will pay you generously.}
<A>__{lionel pockets the coin.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{i will continue to ask questions.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{that's what i was afraid of.}
<C>__{lionel}
<P>__{(admires the plane)}
<D>__{nice job.}
<A>__{bertie sees lionel glance at his watch.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{you've someone waiting?}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{i do now.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{i'd apologize to them in person, but...}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{you don't wish to be seen? slip out the back way.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{after the funeral...it may be even more difficult. to remain unobserved.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{you're having second thoughts.}
<A>__{bertie's silence is confirmation.}
<C>__{lionel }
<D>__{i ask too many questions?}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{perhaps the wrong sort.}
<C>__{lionel}
<P>__{(writes an address)}
<D>__{we live in south kensington, small apartment, but no one would see you.}
<P>__{(added incentive)}
<D>__{lots of planes.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{you know, lionel, you're the first ordinary englishman...}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{australian.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{...i've ever really talked to. sometimes, when i ride through the streets and see a `bloke' i'm struck by how little i know of his life, and how little he knows of mine. cuts both ways.}
<A>__{as bertie is about to leave, lionel requests casually:}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{and if you decide to come, bring the duchess. she might be helpful.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{she might. if i asked. very nicely.}
<P>__{(at back door)}
<D>__{and how will myrtle take to our coming into your home?}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{not sure. she isn't speaking to me.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{wants to go home.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{after the funeral then?}
<A>__{bertie doesn't answer. exits. logue is left holding the plane. he goes to the waiting room door.}
<C>__{lionel }
<D>__{how're you doing, willie?}
<C>__{willie's mum}
<P>__{(speaking for her son)}
<D>__{still can't say a sentence.}
