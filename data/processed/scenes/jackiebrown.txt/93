<L>__{exterior the strand day}
<A>__{the strand is the hip surfer street in downtown hermosa beach. jackie leaves the apartment building. she walks to her car when she spots a funky little beach bar called, "sally leroy's."}
<L>__{interior sally leroy's day}
<A>__{sally leroy's is a beach bar with surfboards, different beer signs, and pictures of marilyn monroe, elvis presley, james dean, ann margaret, and surfers riding monster waves all over the place. the jukebox plays a loud seventies rock number.}
<B>__{beginning of shot}
<A>__{the camera picks jackie up through the window, walking into the place and going up to the bar... a female bartender in her mid twenties, wearing a plaid workshirt, named wanda, goes to jackie.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{do you have a phone?}
<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{yeah, it's in the back.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{... we follow with her to the back of the bar... the music is loud... the phone booth is occupied by a fat older guy wearing surf clothes and sporting a mustache like a walrus. jackie waits for him to finish his call... as she waits, the camera moves back... until a blonde head of hair comes into the f.g.... the camera moves around to a closeup on melanie, sucking on a beer, moving her head to the music, and watching jackie. she smiles and steps out of frame.}

<C>__{melanie }
<D>__{i tell you. if ordell ever sent me to carry in ten thousand dollars, that would be the last motherfuckin' time he saw me. the next trip you're gonna have over half a million. if you thought of cutting ordell out, i sure as hell wouldn't blame you.}
