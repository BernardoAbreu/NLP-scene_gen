<L>__{interior main level}
<A>__{they reach the bottom of the stairs, and head over to the front door. but there's now a glass barrier in front of it, barring anyone from exit.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{what happened to the door?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{son of a bitch.}
<A>__{arthur picks up a chair and hurls it at the glass. it bounces off without a dent. he picks it up and starts banging away. nothing. over the top of the noise a voice bellows out.}

<D>__{what a night i'm having!}
<C>__{rafkin }
<D>__{it's sealed shut.}
