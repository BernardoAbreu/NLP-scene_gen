<A>__{the proceedings are in progress. orlean hurries in, sits in the back. laroche, in a miami hurricanes cap, wrap around mylar sunglasses, and a hawaiian shirt, is on the stand. alan lerner, the tribe's lawyer, questions him.}
<C>__{lerner}
<D>__{finally, mr. laroche, what is your experience in the area of horticulture?}
<C>__{laroche}
<D>__{okay, i've been a professional horticulturist for twelve years. i've owned a plant nursery of my own which was destroyed by the hurricane. i'm a professional plant lecturer. i've given at least sixty lectures on the cultivation of plants. i'm a published author, both in magazine and book form. i have extensive experience with orchids, and the asexual micropropagation of orchids under aseptic cultures. this is laboratory work, not at all like your nursery work.}
