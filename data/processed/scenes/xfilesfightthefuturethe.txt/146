<L>__{interior hallway outside mulder's apartment night}
<A>__{wide angle from end of hall where we see scully, leaving mulder's apartment. moving at a hurried clip to the elevator toward camera. as if anticipating her own impulse to turn around and go back. as she moves into f.g. mulder exits his apt. door.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{you're wrong }
<A>__{he hurries to catch her. as she turns on him.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{why was i assigned to you? to debunk your work. to reign you in. to shut you down.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{you saved me, scully.}
<P>__{(off her look)}
<D>__{as different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. i owe you so much, scully, and you owe me nothing.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i don't want to do this without you. i don't know if i can. if i quit now, they win.}
<A>__{she is silent, moved. in spite of all her desire not to be. she moves to mulder, holds him. they break slightly and she looks up at mulder with deep respect, admiration and... kisses him on the forehead. when... ...suddenly a physical intimacy we've never seen. a heat and passion that can't be denied. the opportunity for the inevitable has presented itself. the moment of truth has arrived. mulder is staring at scully as she's looking back at him. his head moves slightly toward hers as one of his hands moves up to her neck, drawing her to him. where there is hesitation on her part, there is also desire. when:}

<D>__{ouch!!!}
<A>__{scully pulls away from mulder, rubbing at her neck where his hand had been.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{what? what happened?}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{i think... something stung me.}
<A>__{scully's hand comes out with the squirming bee, which she holds in her hand while mulder moves around her, checking her neck.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{it must...}
<A>__{but he doesn't finish his sentence before he has to catch scully from falling. her head bobs and she has to catch it.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{scully...}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{something's wrong...}
<P>__{(fighting for clarity)}
<D>__{i'm having lancinating pain my chest. my... motor functions are being affected. i'm...}
<A>__{mulder lays her down on the floor during this. scully continues to speak, though her eyes are not focusing. she is limp in mulder's arms.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{...my pulse feels thready and i've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{i think you're in anaphylactic shock }
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{no it's }
<A>__{her voice is getting thin now, too.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{scully }
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{i've got no allergy. something... this... mulder... i think... i think you should call an ambulance.}
