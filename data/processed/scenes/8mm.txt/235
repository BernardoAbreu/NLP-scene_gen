<L>__{interior motor lodge room night}
<A>__{the door is shoved inward, hanging crooked by one hinge. eddie enters first, hands still bound behind him. welles pushes eddie forward, gun out. welles turns on his penlight flashlight, shining it into the room. there dead leaves all over the floor. the room's empty except for a chair lying on its side. welles sweeps the room with the inadequate light. this is where mary anne mathews died, vaguely recognizable from the snuff film, without the furniture.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{what are we doing here?}
<A>__{welles goes to the bathroom door, keeping the gun trained on eddie, pushes the bathroom door open with his foot... the bathroom's cracked mirror reflects the penlight and welles' palely lit face.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{that night... you didn't have to be in the room, but you were.}
<P>__{(looks to eddie)}
<D>__{why? why did you watch?}
<A>__{eddie goes to the chair, tips it upright with his foot, sits.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i don't know. i felt like it. i never saw anyone get done before.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{you enjoy it?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{made me sick, but what did i care? what did i care if some hump wants to beat off to that. it was just something i was doing for money.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{tell me what happened.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{what do you want to know? you saw it, you saw the loop...}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{nobody saw you bring her in?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{there wasn't nobody around. this place was a shit hole. i backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries. dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and machine went to work.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{what did you do with her body?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{took it out the bathroom window. buried it in the woods.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{show me.}
