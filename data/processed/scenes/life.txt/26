<L>__{exterior back alley night}
<A>__{ray and claude head down the alley.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{you sure the truck's this way?}
<P>__{(looking over his shoulder)}
<D>__{i swear it was back that way.}
<A>__{suddenly, the bloodied figure of winston hancock lurches from the shadows and grabs claude by the lapels. claude is too scared to scream, staggering backward. but the man's grip loosens and he slips to the ground.}
<C>__{claude}
<P>__{(croaking)}
<D>__{ray... yo, ray...!}
<A>__{ray turns back to find claude trembling with fear and covered in blood. he just points down. ray eyes widen. he kneels down and turns winston's body over.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i think he's hurt pretty bad.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{he's dead.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{oh, man, i've never seen a dead body before!}
<A>__{much to claude's horror, ray starts rifling through winston's pockets.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{what do you think you're doing?! the man's been dead for two seconds! don't you have any respect?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{it ain't here.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{what ain't there?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{my daddy's watch. this is the dude i was telling you about }
<A>__{suddenly, the glare of two bright headlights from a pickup truck freeze ray and claude in a guilty tableau. five white men appear at the end of the alley.}
<C>__{man with lantern}
<D>__{what's going on here?}
<A>__{ray gingerly releases winston's lifeless body.}
<C>__{man with lantern}
<D>__{what's wrong with that one?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{him? he's just drunk.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{yeah, nobody puts 'em away like old what's his name.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{winston. his name's winston.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{come on, ray, better get winston back to the truck.}
<A>__{claude and ray hoist winston's body to its feet. the man raises his lantern, takes a closer look at winston's face.}
<C>__{man with lantern}
<D>__{this fella looks dead.}
<A>__{ray and claude check for themselves.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{would you look at that, ray. winston up and died on us.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{hell with him then. if he can't share the driving, he can't ride in the truck.}
<C>__{man with lantern}
<D>__{he can ride with us.}
<A>__{suddenly, the men all have guns. and they're pointed at ray and claude.}
<C>__{man with lantern}
<D>__{so can you.}
