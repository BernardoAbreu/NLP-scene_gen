<A>__{all the monitors are going crazy.}
<C>__{janice}
<D>__{something's happening.}
<A>__{frank leans into the microphone.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{listen up! electric activity increasing in all limbs. brainwaves are through the roof.}
<C>__{janice}
<D>__{i didn't think the human brain could spike that high.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{maybe it can't.}

<A>__{sebastian screams in dire pain. he struggles against his restraints as his skin liquefies into a muscular mass. it's like something's eating away at him. gruesome. the yells become louder and more painful to hear.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{no. oh god! no! stop it! stop it!}
<A>__{the muscular system begins to dissolve, leaving a struggling skeleton wrapped with tentacular blood vessels and stuffed with the major organs. the beating heart, the heaving lungs.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{pulse is 180 .... holding stable.}
<A>__{screaming.... then the organs go. then the blood vessels. leaving only a skeleton howling in pain. the jawbones spread wide ... screaming... screaming...}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{holy shit.}
<A>__{then as if someone had poured acid all over the bones, the skeleton evaporates into nothingness.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{pulse is dropping. 170.. 150 .... 160..}
<A>__{there is nothing left of sebastian caine.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{bio quantum phase shift occurred at 18:26.}
<A>__{the screaming continues and the restraints continue to twist and turn. suddenly the restraints go limp.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{is he dead?}
<A>__{linda checks the readouts.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{no. he passed out from the trauma.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{vitals returning to normal. pulse 110 ... dropping. blood pressure 130 over}
<A>__{a long beat as everybody's eyes stare at the instruments.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{electrical activity is stabilizing.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{pulse steady at 70.}
<A>__{a long beat.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{un fucking believable.}
<A>__{a reverent pause as linda runs her fingers over what would be his skin. small electrical charge dance around her fingertips. she gasps.}
<C>__{linda}
<P>__{(whispers in his ear)}
<D>__{you did it, sebastian. you're the first.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{let's get him into recovery.}
