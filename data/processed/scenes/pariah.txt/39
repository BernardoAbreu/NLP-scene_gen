<D>__{hi! this is lee, i'm not able to answer my phone right now }
<A>__{laura snaps her cell phone shut. a ged study book still glossy and uncreased is propped open on the bed in front of her. she opens her cell phone again and pulls up alike's number. her thumb hovers over the `talk' button. she snaps the phone shut and tosses it aside before turning the radio down and dragging the book closer. the cell phone rings and she snatches it up. a picture of a girl making a kissy face with the name "tasha" underneath blinks onto the screen and laura snaps the phone shut and tosses it aside. she hoists the ged book into her lap and lets her head hit the wall. there is a knock at her bedroom door and candace peeks in.}

<D>__{how's it comin'?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{it's good.}
<A>__{candace smiles at laura and hesitates before closing the door. candace turns the radio off before ducking back out. laura sighs and flips back to the beginning of the book.}
