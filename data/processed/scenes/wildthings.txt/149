<L>__{exterior small boat harbor (island) day}
<A>__{sam and ray work on the deck of sam's sloop, stowing gear, loading supplies. the boat's mast shines in the sunlight before a brilliant sky. palms sway. the men work in silence.}
<L>__{exterior smilin' jack's fish camp day}
<A>__{gloria drives up in the white taurus. she parks before the ramshackle old building and the gator pen. walter is in the pen. ruby stands just outside of it. she looks toward the road as gloria gets out, then back to the pen. gloria comes down the bank to stand beside ruby. she's just in time to see the huge old reptile raise itself, hissing, on its front legs, jaws sprung wide. the women watch as walter sticks his arm into the gator's mouth.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{gator can't see what's in front of it for shit. they see out the sides.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that one don't even know walter's arm's in his mouth.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{what if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{then i guess walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye.}
<P>__{(loud enough for walter to hear)}
<D>__{he don't use it for no good deeds anyway.}
<A>__{walter looks at the ladies, picks up the stick and sweeps it between the gaping jaws, which snap in its wake.}
<C>__{ruby }
<D>__{you come all the way out here to watch walter?}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{i was wondering if i could ask you a few questions.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{about suzie?}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{actually, i was wondering if i might ask you about ray duquette.}
<C>__{ruby}
<P>__{(a long beat)}
<D>__{he used to come around here. he had a thing going with one of the girls over at the glades.}
<A>__{ruby nods toward the motel, a bitter smile on her face.}
<C>__{ruby }
<D>__{got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{she still work there?}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{no. not after that night.}
<P>__{(a long beat)}
<D>__{i don't know what happened. maybe he caught her with some john... all i know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... indian kid named davy. used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. him and suzie were at the glades that night.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it was right after that, ray got suzie busted and sent her away. that's what there is to say about ray duquette.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{was there ever any kind of investigation...}
<A>__{ruby cuts her off with a short laugh.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{duquette always claimed the kid was dusted, came after him with a knife. but it was jack's fish camp... this could be the moon for all most people care.}
<P>__{(a long beat)}
<D>__{wasn't supposed to be like that though. this place was supposed to be something once. there were going to be roads and houses. there was going to be a town. they were going to call it salt creek.}
