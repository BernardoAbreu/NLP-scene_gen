<A>__{homer walks down the corridor, dressed in his operating gown, as the door to the o.r. opens and wally stumbles out, hurriedly opening a window. wally breathes deeply to regain his composure.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{i think it was the ether the smell got to me.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{god. this is all my fault.}
<A>__{edna comes down the hall with a dirt stained, crying curly who's covering one eye.}

<C>__{edna}
<D>__{he's down the hall, throwing up.}
<A>__{homer nods to edna, who is marching off with curly. wally smiles at homer.}

<D>__{really! is it serious?}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{no, it's not serious. i'm just not supposed to get excited. you know no strain, no stress. i try to keep calm all the time.}
<A>__{wally hears homer's facetiousness how tired he is of his heart condition.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{oh, well. i don't imagine there's any strain or stress around here!}
<A>__{homer appreciates the joke. the door to the operating room that wally exited opens into the corridor; candy is being wheeled out on a gurney by larch and angela. wally rushes to candy's side. homer follows slowly. candy is groggy, coming out of the ether.}
