<L>__{interior freighter hold day}
<A>__{mac and gin stand inside a gigantic cargo bay, watching massive containers being loaded by crane from a dock, through the gaping hatch. the chamber is a vaulted cathedral of steel, painted hospital green, and mac's eye moves over all of it, seeming to inspect every plate, every pan head rivet.}
<P>__{voice (o.s., british cheer)}
<D>__{hullo, there!}
<A>__{they turn to see a round little man with watering eyes and a very wide necktie, skipping down the iron steps. bursting with a salesman's bonhomie, he extends a plump hand...}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{nickerson carlsby, mr... macduff, yes?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{banquo macduff. this is my associate fiancee, ms. duncan.}
<A>__{the little man pauses. a tic in the well oiled smile...}
<C>__{carlsby}
<D>__{that is...fiancee and assoc...}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{i'm a hyphenate.}
<A>__{ah. like that makes complete sense. fingers the gardenia in his lapel...}
<C>__{carlsby}
<D>__{well, it's a pleasure, in this alien place, to do business with a countryman.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{i'm a scot. it's a different country. culturally and historically.}
<A>__{i see.}
<C>__{carlsby }
<D>__{well. they've brought you to quite the wrong place, i see.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{thank god.}
<A>__{angle...carlsby leads the way along a narrow catwalk, which ends at a steel door. he presses his thumb to the i.d. panel, and speaks into the voice box...}
<P>__{carlsby (confidential code voice)}
<D>__{in penny lane, the barber shaves another customer...}
<A>__{the door clangs open. they go through it, as a gangway leads toward an open five foot thick vault door, where two armed guards rise from their seats. carlsby ignores them as if they were furniture. thumps the door...}
<C>__{carlsby}
<D>__{five feet thick with hidden rein forcements, no way to drill through!}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{impressive.}
<C>__{carlsby}
<D>__{only the tip of our security iceberg. see these two brinks locks...?}
<A>__{they do.}
<C>__{carlsby}
<D>__{the captain keeps one key. the other is continually forwarded: to the chief of security at next port. there is no way to enter during voyage.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{i like this.}
<A>__{carisby glances to mac. he is stone.}
<C>__{carlsby}
<D>__{the best armed guard, rotated every six hours. a redundancy, of course, but we would rather be safe three times over than merely two.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{sound mathematics.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{what if there's a fire? in the chamber.}
<A>__{ah. carlsby leads them through the open door, into... ...the maximum security hold. primo. the steel coated with sleek, matte, black all grip painterior tubby points up...}
<C>__{carlsby}
<D>__{sprinklers. new design. incredible power. the entire chamber is water proof, fireproof, airtight. if the ship sinks , god forfend, your cargo is secure for salvage.}
<A>__{no reaction. mac does not look convinced.}
<C>__{carlsby}
<D>__{and your cargo is...?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{wine.}
<A>__{wine.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{the bloody japs bought up half the premium clarets in the universe. you may have heard.}
<A>__{actually. he has.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{i'm in charge of shipping some 14,000 bottles, most quite rare, to a number of premium hotels in hong kong, bangkok, singapore, phuket, and penang.}
<A>__{carlsby gets the romance of it all.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{all of which are destinations on your october voyage. five months from now. however...}
<A>__{and turns to the man. with laser, disapproving eyes.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{wine. doesn't prefer. to be jostled.}
<A>__{the man beams. gestures to a series of platforms, each swaying at different heights, in different directions.}
<C>__{carlsby}
<D>__{our 'delicate treasure' platforms, suspended on gimbals. your cargo remains unruffled by roiling seas. then, on arrival, is plucked...}
<A>__{pointing once more...}
<C>__{carlsby}
<D>__{by that forklift, and gently deposited on dock through the cargo hatch...}
<A>__{...a huge circular hatch cut into the hull. mac's eyes stare blankly at it. a long beat. he pronounces it all...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{adequate. i suppose.}
<A>__{and then turns once more.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{did we see...a bathing pool. on deck?}
<C>__{carlsby}
<D>__{oh, yes, sir. the shikoku maru carries sixteen luxury suite pas senger cabins. the finest cuisine. for valued clients who prefer to cruise in privacy.}
<A>__{mac. thinks this over.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{mildly. interesting.}
