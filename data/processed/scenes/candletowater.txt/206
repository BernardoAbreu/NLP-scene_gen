<D>__{what the fuck easy peasy, ho!}
<A>__{she fights him: the focussed power of a trained soldier; but he's too strong and doesn't seem to feel blows that should be causing him a lot of pain. he punches her in the head twice. she goes still. caleb now pulls the silenced gun he's been trying to get his hands on throughout the fight from his jacket pocket. he stands, gasping for breath. he aims the gun at her.}
