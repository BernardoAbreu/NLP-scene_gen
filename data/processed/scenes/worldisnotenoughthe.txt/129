<A>__{four soldiers. the first guy and a moustachioed pilot and two young men, a nasty looking private, cadaverously thin, and a big, thick necked tough. they all look at bond, expectantly, waiting for him to say or do...what? he decides to take the lead. he opens the briefcase and hands over the stacks of money. the pilot passes it out. but that isn't the end. they still stare at him. the pilot says something in russian that sounds like..."where's the rest?" bond swallows. thinks, without showing it. he decides to open the duffle bag. he looks inside. pauses, then reaches in and takes out...a box of nike shoes. the thin soldier smiles. that's the ticket. bond hands out shoes to the rest of the guys.}
