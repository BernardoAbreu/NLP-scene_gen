<A>__{watts swims by and guides her out of the water. watts and martha ascend up a narrow dirt path to the top of a rock face.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{you ready?}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{i can't.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{sure you can.}
<A>__{watts jumps. martha stands alone at the top of the cliff naked. everyone is looking up at her cheering her on. she builds up the courage and jumps.}
<D>__{she hits the water, everything goes dark. the frame fills with tiny bubbles, she comes up for air exhilarated. she continues to swim, the camera follows her under water. the darkness of the water makes the screen go black. interior farm house night the hallway is dark, the space is unclear. martha walks down a hallway and we learn it's the farm house. she walks into patrick's room. she get's into bed with him and curls up in his arms and falls asleep. she looks safe and happy. he welcomes her, the room looks warm and comforting.}
