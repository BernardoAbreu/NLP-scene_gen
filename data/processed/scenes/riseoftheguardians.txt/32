<D>__{oh, hey phil.}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{keep up, jack! keep up!}
<A>__{north charges ahead. north's factory is bustling with activity: yeti's are building toys, moving packages, while elves are test piloting the various flying toys. as jack walks behind north, surveying the factory, a duck toy suddenly flies over jack's head. jack ducks just in time and continues after north.}

<D>__{very nice! keep up good work!}

<P>__{(to yeti)}
<D>__{i don't like it. paint it red.}
<A>__{the yeti reacts in dismay as we reveal hundreds of finished blue robots.}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{step it up, everybody.}
<A>__{as north and jack move to the opposite end of the chamber, we finally glimpse the orchestrated chaos of the entire workshop, in all it's magic and splendor.}
