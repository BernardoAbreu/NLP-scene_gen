<C>__{royce}
<D>__{well, not this. i was doing the pentagon scene few nights ago. got some fresh stuff about you. you may be in a hostile camp. i think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{me? why me?}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{don't you know? how they're talking about you?}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{i saw an article...}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{i can't walk two blocks in washington without hearing about "g.i. jane." you're all over the place, and whether you wanted it or not, the feminists are sizing you up for that poster.}
<A>__{jordan's face sours with an errant thought.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{so why are you telling me this?}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{big symbols make big targets, jordan. i think someone's gunning for you.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{you know, royce, i got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{i'm only trying to warn you in case }
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{well, let me warm you: i'm going though with this. the more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish. so don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{that's not what i want, jordan. i mean... it is and it isn't...}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{still can't make up your mind, huh? gotta go, royce.}
<C>__{royce}
<D>__{jordan. you watch your ass.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{sure. i will join the crowd.}
