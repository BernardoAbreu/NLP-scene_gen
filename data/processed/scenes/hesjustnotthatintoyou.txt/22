<C>__{amber}
<D>__{caller id was the worst thing that's ever happened to me. total invasion of my personal freedom. when a guy doesn't call me, it is my right my duty even to call him and hang up several thousand times. or at least until his mother shouts at me in albanian and blows a police whistle into the phone. i mean, calling and hanging up is an age old expression of love and frustration and too many wine coolers and who is at& f'ing t to take that away from me?}
<C>__{amber }
<D>__{next thing you know, someone is going to ban me from sitting in my car in front of a guy's house, blaring "where is your heart" by kelly clarkson until his new stupid girlfriend comes outside and threatens to scratch my eyes out with her acrylics. i mean, a girl deserves freedom of expression, right?}
