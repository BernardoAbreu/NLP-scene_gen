<L>__{interior parlor, nolan house, new orleans night, 1918}
<A>__{we see the doctor, an older man in a tired suit, who has done this longer than he cares to remember, finishing examining one of the elderly boarders. he puts his things into his doctor's bag. queenie comes beside him, saying something...}
<L>__{interior queenie's room that night, 1918}
<A>__{the baby is lying on queenie's bed... dr. rose, stethoscope ever dangling, washes his hands in a sink.}
<C>__{doctor rose}
<D>__{... he's nearly blind from cataracts... i'm not sure he can hear... his bones indicate severe arthritis... his skin has lost all elasticity... his hands and feet are ossified... he has all the deterioration, the infirmities, not of a newborn, but of a man well in his eighties on the way to his grave...}
<C>__{queenie}
<D>__{you mean to say he's dying?}
<C>__{doctor rose}
<D>__{of old age. his body is failing him before his life's begun.}
<A>__{they're still, looking at the strange baby.}
<C>__{doctor rose }
<D>__{where did he come from?}
<C>__{queenie}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{it's my sister's child... from lafayette. she had an unfortunate adventure.}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{the poor child got the worse of it... came out white...}
<C>__{doctor rose}
<D>__{there are places for 'unwanted' babies like these, queenie... there's no room for another mouth to feed here... the nolan foundation, despite their good intentions, thinks this place is a large nuisance as it is... a baby here }
<C>__{queenie}
<P>__{(appealing)}
<D>__{you said he don't have long.}
<C>__{doctor rose}
<D>__{queenie some creatures aren't meant to survive.}
<A>__{she looks at the baby, determined.}
<C>__{queenie}
<D>__{he is a miracle, that's for certain... just not the kind of miracle one hopes to see...}
