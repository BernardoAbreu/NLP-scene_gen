<L>__{interior embalming room day}
<A>__{crawford, in one corner of the room, has set up a litton policefax fingerprint transmitter. sound of many men's low voices, in background. he is on the phone, and has to speak loudly.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{i need a six way linkup! chicago, detroit, cleveland, st. louis, atlanta, and dallas... what?... can you hear me...?}
<A>__{he looks around, frustrated by the noisy circus atmosphere.}
<B>__{clarice}
<A>__{is pulling on a pair of surgical gloves. she raises her voice, turning up her natural accent by several notches.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{gentlemen. you officers and gentlemen! listen here a minute, please. there's things i need to do for her...}
<B>__{wider angle}
<A>__{as we see that the small room is very crowded with deputies and troopers. they gradually fall silent, looking at her.}
<C>__{clarice }
<D>__{y'all brought her this far, and i know her folks would thank you if they could. now please go on out and let me take care of her... go on, now.}
<A>__{the men look at one another, a little bashfully, then begin to to file out, whispering among themselves. as they go, a bright green body bag is revealed, tightly zipped, lying on a porcelain embalming table. it is almost the only modern object in this victorian room, with its glass paned cabinets and faded wallpaper, decorated with cabbage roses.}
<B>__{favoring crawford}
<A>__{as he looks at clarice with a new degree of respect. men brush by him, till finally only two are left: dr. akin, a family g.p., and lamar, a lean, whiskey reddened mortician. sound of the door closing. lamar dabs around his nostrils with vicks vaporub.}
<C>__{crawford}
<P>__{(on phone)}
<D>__{we're starting. tell everybody to stand by for fingerprint transmission.}
<B>__{clarice}
<A>__{at a side counter, has turned back to her open fingerprint kit. she is lifting out a camera when she hears the zipper of the body bag being slowly opened, behind her... one gloved hand flies to her mouth as she reacts, involuntarily, to the sudden smell. she blinks at her reflection in the cabinet glass, then steels herself to turn, look at the corpse.}
<C>__{clarice}
<P>__{(pause; softly)}
<D>__{bill...}
<A>__{she steadies herself by raising her camera, takes a flash photo. low angle looking up, from beneath table as dr. akin gently lifts aside one of the dead girl's arms. a piece of fishing line, with multiple hooks, is still snagged around it, dangling. crawford leans in for a closer look.}
<C>__{dr. akin}
<D>__{wrongful death... she'll have to go to the state pathologist at claxton when you're done.}
<P>__{(crawford nods)}
<D>__{i better get on back for the rest of that service. lamar'll help you.}
<P>__{(shaken)}
<D>__{lord almighty...}
<A>__{he leaves, and clarice leans into shot, taking another photo.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{what do you see, starling?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{well, she's not local. her ears are pierced three times each, and she's wearing green glitter nail polish. looks like town to me...}
<B>__{close angle}
<A>__{on the calf of one of the girl's legs, as clarice trails the inside of her bare wrist along the skin.}
<C>__{clarice }
<D>__{she waxed her legs, i think... a big girl, just like the others but she was careful about her appearance...}
<B>__{upward angle again}
<A>__{as lamar joins them for a closer look.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{two of the fingernails are broken off, and there's dirt or grit under the others. she tried to claw her way through something... i will scrape out samples after i've printed her.}
<A>__{she takes another flash, then quickly reloads film.}
<C>__{lamar}
<D>__{them fishhooks are set too close together. no wonder the franklin boys was scared to say they found her.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{think they were runnin' a trotline?}
<A>__{crawford and lamar both look at her curiously.}
<C>__{clarice}
<P>__{(to crawford)}
<D>__{it's a fish and game violation. like poaching. there's a big fine.}
<C>__{lamar}
<D>__{right... are you from around here?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{they do it lots of places.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{get photos of her teeth. then we'll fax her fingerprints to washington, try to trace her through missing persons.}
<A>__{side angle close on the dead girl's face staring blue eyes, short reddish hair. clarice sets the polaroid, with its special attachments, against the face, while lamar gently retracts the lips. each time the camera flashes, there's a bright glow inside the cheeks. new angle chest high as clarice examines a developing printerior}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{she's got something in her throat.}
<A>__{she hands the print to crawford; he and lamar look at it, as she searches in her kit.}
<C>__{lamar}
<D>__{when a body comes out of the water, alots of times there's like, leaves and things in the mouth.}
<A>__{clarice holds up a pair of forceps. she glances at crawford, who nods. she bends over, partially out of shot, and after a few moments reappears, holding up a small, brown cylindrical object. she turns this in the air, as they all stare.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{what is it some kind of seed pod?}
<C>__{lamar}
<D>__{nawsir, that's a bug cocoon. but how come that to get way down in there? 'less somebody shoved it in...}
<A>__{clarice and crawford exchange a glance.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{she'll be easier to print if we turn her over. lamar, will you give me a hand?}
<C>__{lamar}
<D>__{yessir, i will. clarice takes a jar from her kit, carefully drops the cocoon inside.}
<A>__{sound of the men's heavy efforts as they turn over the body, off screen. she seals the jar, staring into it at the cocoon.}
<C>__{crawford }
<D>__{starling what do you make of these?}
<A>__{she turns to look.}
<B>__{her pov}
<A>__{low on the corpse's back, over the shoulders, two neat, triangular patches of skin are missing. new angle two shot as clarice looks at crawford.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{i don't know. i didn't see those on any of the other girls...}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{they weren't there. get close ups.}
<A>__{clarice raises her camera, leans in for another flash.}
