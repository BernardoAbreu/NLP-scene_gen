<C>__{what lies beneath}
<D>__{by clark gregg june 14, 1999}
<T>__{fade in:}
<A>__{moving through a murky haze. dark blues and greens, shafts of prismed purple. a pale shard appears in the distance. gliding closer, a group of tiny fish dart before the camera. we're underwater. arriving at the form, it finally sharpens into focus. it's a woman's body submerged in dark water, arms floating lazily at her side. the face is obscured by flowing hair. all that is visible is a pair of cold, staring green eyes, which blink closed...}
<T>__{morph to:}
<A>__{...then open as blue eyes, as a different face emerges from water. claire spencer awakens from this unsettling dream in her bathtub. she pivots the large brass shower head (the kind that moves up and down on a pipe) off to one side, reaches toward her feet and we hear the sound of a plug being pulled.}
<L>__{interior bathroom day}
<A>__{a hazy shape accompanied by a whirring sound. a steam covered mirror is cleared with a blow dryer. claire starts to come into focus. the dryer stops. she presses the red g.f.i. button on the socket. zap! a big blue spark shoots out. claire pulls her hand back...and the dryer starts whirring again. she clears the mirror and replaces the dryer on a hook. she regards herself in the mirror, and attractive, elegant looking woman around forty. claire traces a finger along a small but noticeable scar above her left eye, then slowly drops the hand to her cheek, as if confirming her existence.}
<L>__{interior claire's house day}
<A>__{claire, now dressed, presses her face against a door, listening for the sounds of stirring from within. silence. she quietly pushes open the door.}
<L>__{interior room day}
<A>__{claire makes her way past half filled boxes and duffels to a window, then pulls the curtains to reveal: a lovely, wooded lake. it couldn't be more picturesque. a}
<L>__{24' sailboat is moored at the dock and an old stone}
<A>__{lighthouse sits on a point across the lake. the sunlight motivates an unconscious groan from a figure still shrouded by covers. claire sits beside the sleeping form. she scans the room briefly, taking in a greenpeace flag and a picture of a tomboyish ten year old girl at camp. she gently pulls back the covers and peers down at the same face, now a waifish, pretty seventeen year old, with chopped hair and tiny nose ring. claire leans over and inhales the sleeping scent of her only daughter, caitlin. she places her hand on a cheek. the girl's eyelids flutter softly.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{morning, beauty.}
<A>__{caitlin lets out a grunt and rolls over onto her belly.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{let's go. or we'll never leave on time.}
<A>__{from out of the pillow comes caitlin's voice.}
<C>__{caitlin}
<P>__{(muffled)}
<D>__{i'm totally ready.}
<A>__{claire glances around at the piles of unpacked clothes.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{come on, i will make you some waffles, maybe we'll squeeze in a trip to the mall.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{caitlin...}
<A>__{claire gently swats at the tiny lump that is caitlin's behind.}
<C>__{caitlin}
<D>__{mother...}
<A>__{claire stands and instinctively scoops up some clothes from the floor, then folds and neatly stacks them on a box. caitlin turns her head sideways on the pillow.}
<C>__{caitlin}
<D>__{you're such a morning person.}
<A>__{claire turns at the door.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{it is unwise to heckle the keeper of the plastic.}
<A>__{she starts to leave. caitlin calls out.}
<C>__{caitlin }
<D>__{blueberries!}
<A>__{claire smiles as she closes the door behind her.}
<L>__{interior hallway day}
<A>__{claire bends down to pick up one of caitlin's socks. when she stands, something catches her eye out a window. she gazes down, transfixed.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{through a stand of trees over a high wooden fence, a young couple is in the midst of a heated argument next door. claire watches as the husband, a large imposing man with an unruly shock of red hair, snarls at his wife across the hood of their huge old buick. she tries to get a glimpse of the woman, but all that's visible is the back of her blond head. a tan, sinewy arm encircles claire's waist. she lets out a small gasp as a hand closes on her breast. it's claire's husband, dr. norman spencer, nibbling gently at her neck. he's older than she, pushing fifty, with silver streaks beginning to permeate the shaggy mop of hair that makes him look more like a preppy rocker or a lacrosse coach than the prominent academic that he is. claire, however, can't take her eyes off the scene below.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{they at it again?}
<A>__{claire nods.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{christ, that's twice in...when did they move in?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i think three...}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{three weeks.}
<A>__{she continues to gaze downward. the man leans over the hood, murmuring darkly at his wife, though for claire and norman the scene is entirely silent.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{what's their name?}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{feur, i think. psych department. figures. they're all psychotic.}
<A>__{outside, mr. feur turns and walks toward his house. norman begins, once again, to nuzzle claire. her eyes close, but then she gently demurs.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{she's awake.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{we'll be quiet. quick and quiet.}
<A>__{she turns to him.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i don't want to be either.}
<A>__{he smiles. a really good smile. the lips and tongue on his faded t shirt mark him as a 'stones fan.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{when's she out of here?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{norman spencer.}
<A>__{norman gives up. he busses her cheek.}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(moving toward the stairs)}
<D>__{alright. i can't take the rejection. i'm going to class.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{don't.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{claire, i have to show up for the }
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{it's saturday.}
<A>__{norman stops.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i knew that. you think i didn't know that?}
<A>__{she smiles at him. after a beat:}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{it's today?}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(wistfully)}
<D>__{yep.}
<A>__{they share a warm, poignant look. he turns and moves down the stairs.}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(calling over his shoulder)}
<D>__{we're going to have to leave by three if we want to beat the traffic.}
<A>__{claire returns her gaze to the scene below as mr. feur says something ominous to his wife, then stalks into the house.}
<C>__{norman }
<D>__{claire?}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(absently)}
<D>__{three o'clock.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{mrs. feur drops her face into her hands.}
<L>__{exterior sidewalk cafe day}
<A>__{claire peruses her "to do" list as caitlin munches a panini.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{...and i still think we should get you some mittens.}
<A>__{caitlin puts down the sandwich and regards her mother warmly. the bond between them is palpable.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{do you have a scarf?}
<C>__{caitlin}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{claire looks up from her little pad of paper.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{caitlin}
<D>__{it's only two hours away.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i know that.}
<C>__{caitlin}
<D>__{i will come back all the time.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{of course you will.}
<C>__{caitlin}
<D>__{i'm just saying, you're going to be fine.}
<A>__{claire smiles.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{sweetheart, i've known this day was coming for a long time. i've got your father and the garden and the new house. you really don't have to worry.}
<A>__{caitlin smiles back and nods, her face betraying some concern. claire takes her hand.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{really.}
<A>__{she nods reassuringly and pulls caitlin into an embrace. her eyes close.}

<D>__{mother...}
<L>__{exterior columbia university day}
<A>__{claire's frozen in the hug.}
<C>__{caitlin}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{mom.}
<A>__{her eyes open. widen to reveal claire, holding caitlin on the college campus. the urban skyline looms in the background.}
<C>__{caitlin}
<D>__{i have'ta go.}
<A>__{after a moment's hesitation, she releases her grip. caitlin glances over her shoulder to make sure no one's witnessed this overt display of maternal affection.}
<C>__{caitlin}
<D>__{i will call you.}
<A>__{claire produces an envelope, which she presses into her daughter's hand. it's a book of train tickets.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{come home anytime.}
<A>__{caitlin looks at norman.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{really gonna leave me, huh?}
<A>__{she nods. they share a tender look.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{be good.}
<A>__{she throws her arm, briefly, tightly around his waist. a bit overwhelmed, he slowly brings his hand to the back of caitlin's head. after a moment, she steps back...}
<C>__{caitlin}
<D>__{bye.}
<A>__{...then turns and makes her way toward the large, old columbia dorm. a banner is draped across its portals which reads:}
<D>__{"welcome class of '04."}
<A>__{claire watches her daughter melt into a crowd of similarly shaggy freshmen, smoking and talking on the front steps. her eyes are shining. norman wraps an arm around her waist as she daps at a tear with a kleenex.}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i almost made it.}
<A>__{they turn and head for the car. claire sneaks one last look over her shoulder.}

<A>__{caitlin glancing back at claire with an apprehensive smile.}
<L>__{interior norman and claire's room night}
<A>__{claire walks in from the bathroom wearing a sexy cotton nightgown. norman is in bed, absorbed in some notes. she gets into bed, then picks up a thick text from beside him and starts reading. after a moment:}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{whatcha reading?}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(reading the cover, sexy voice)}
<D>__{genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(slight smile)}
<D>__{how is it?}
<A>__{claire snuggles up.}
<C>__{claire}

<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(lost in his book)}
<D>__{nice.}

<A>__{she pulls slightly away.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{if you have to work...}

<D>__{no, no. i'm just about...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{there.}
<A>__{he places his book on the bedside table and turns to her.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{how are you?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{fine.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{it's okay if you're not.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i am, really.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{it's just she's been the focus for a while.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{not the focus.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{you know what i mean.}
<A>__{claire thinks for a moment.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{to tell you the truth...i'm excited.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{you are...}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{to get my life back. to have some time for myself. some time for us.}
<A>__{he caresses her.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{you did a great job. she's a good kid.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{we did.}
<A>__{there's a weighty pause.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{it's just us now.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{he kisses her.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{tired?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{nope.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{wanna fool around?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{yup.}
<A>__{they start to kiss. it's slow and a bit methodical in the manner of long time lovers. suddenly, the sound of a woman wailing can be heard. they stop.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{did you...}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{shhh.}
<A>__{they listen. the sounds start to become louder. it is clearly two people in the throes of some very vocal and savage love making.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{jesus.}
<A>__{he walks over and closes the window. it doesn't help.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i guess they're making up.}
<A>__{the woman's moaning becomes embarrassingly loud.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{what is he doing to her?}
<A>__{they lie together in silence as the cacophony drones on.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{and we moved out here for the quiet.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{mmm.}
<A>__{beat. the mood has passed.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{maybe we should just...}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{tomorrow.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{i'm finished at three. no. squash with stan.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{after that.}
<C>__{norman}

<D>__{love you.}
<A>__{she smiles.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{night.}
<A>__{they lie together in the darkness as the feurs finally climax.}
<L>__{interior caitlin's room day}
<A>__{claire pushes open the door to caitlin's room carrying an armful of folded laundry. she moves quickly to the bureau, not wanting to spend much time in here, then grabs a tiny black top from the pile, and drops it into a drawer. she's just about to close it, when something catches her eye. claire's pov she drops the laundry and slowly pulls a tattered, old juilliard t shirt with a very seventies logo from the drawer. claire gazes around the room, which is a reliquary of caitlin's recently concluded childhood; pictures, trophies,}
<B>__{stuffed animals.}
<A>__{she brings the now faded t shirt to her face and drinks in the smells. she stares down at the word "juilliard."}
<T>__{match cut to:}
<L>__{interior basement day}
<A>__{"juilliard"...now it's on the same t shirt only claire's wearing it and she's much younger. it's an old photograph in an album. younger norman stands next to her in the shot, his arm draped around her waist. a cello case stands beside her. claire glances around at several hastily unpacked boxes and sees propped in the corner...the cello case. she gazes at other photos. claire in her wedding dress, norman beside her in a tux with a very wide bow tie. claire and norman in front of a university building. a tiny caitlin rests on her hip. claire's chin begins to tremble and she chokes out a sob.}
<L>__{exterior front yard day}
<A>__{her face streaked with tears, claire stumbles out into the immaculately manicured rose garden. the yard is surrounded by a high wooden fence. she collapses into a lawn chair as the tears begin to subside. suddenly, she hears something coming from next door. she cocks her head and attempts to make out the sound. it is, ironically, the sound of a woman crying. claire makes her way over to the fence. the women's sobbing becomes more plaintive and fevered. she places her face against the prickly, vine covered fence and tries to peer through the crack. all she can make out is a dark blue blur that seems to be rocking. claire gathers her nerve and calls out...}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{hello...}
<A>__{there's no reaction.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{mrs. feur?}
<A>__{the sobbing chokes down to a breathless whimpering. the blue shape vanishes from view.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{wait a minute. i just want }
<A>__{something bumps against the fence. claire draws back. she hears heavy breathing.}
<C>__{mrs. feur}

<D>__{it's mrs...it's claire...spencer. from next door. is everything }

<D>__{um...yes.}
<C>__{mrs. feur}
<D>__{i've seen you. from the window.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{is everything alright?}
<A>__{claire leans closer to the tiny crack. she sees a fleshy blur and what might be part of an eye. there's no response, just the breathing.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{mrs. feur}
<D>__{i'm not...}
<A>__{she seems on the verge of losing it again.}
<C>__{mrs. feur}
<D>__{he's so...it's too much...and i can't...i can't breath...}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{who? your husband?}

<D>__{and i'm afraid. oh god, i'm so afraid of...}
<A>__{she trails off.}
<C>__{claire}

<C>__{mrs. feur}
<D>__{i can't, no, no, i can't...}
<A>__{claire edges closer to the crack.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{tell me. please.}
<C>__{mrs. feur}
<D>__{that i will just...that one day i will just...disappear.}
<A>__{beat. claire's taken aback by this admission.}

<D>__{tell me. i can help you.}
<C>__{mrs. feur}
<D>__{how? how can you help me? with your flowers and your perfect life...}

<C>__{claire}
<D>__{wait! don't go...}
<A>__{claire listens to the sound of naked footsteps, followed by a large front door swinging shut. a car door swings open and a man's shoes follow down the path. claire pulls back from the crack and leans against the fence as the door closes a second time. she sits there for a moment listening, but all is quiet.}
<C>__{claire }
<D>__{she sounded terrified.}
<L>__{interior dining room night}
<A>__{claire and norman eat dinner. a rainstorm pelts the windows.}

<A>__{she hears the sound of a door closing and moves to get a better view of the feur's. nothing but blackness. just as she's turning to go back to bed. a lightning flash lights up the night. claire's eyes go wide. claire's pov in the split second of brilliance, she sees mr. feur, in shirtsleeves, drenched, dragging a large duffel toward the open trunk of his car.}

<P>__{(in a hoarse whisper)}

<L>__{exterior backyard morning}
<A>__{claire sets up a camera and tripod. she steps back and aims her camera. she glances up at a large upstairs window at the feur's house. one side of the curtain seems to be pulled open, but no one's there. feeling self conscious, she turns back to the camera. the morning sun hits the flowers just right and she snaps several pictures of them against her lovely house. she glances back at the feur's window. the curtain is now}
<B>__{closed.}
<A>__{she walks over to the fence and tries to peek through it. when this doesn't work, she drags a lawn chair over and peers across the fence. she can barely see over, but glimpses: a deep furrow in the mud of the driveway. just then, a car pulls into the driveway, claire scrambles down from her perch.}
<L>__{exterior driveway day}
<A>__{claire walks out to find her best friend, jody, pretty, in her forties, wearing hip, hippie ish clothes.}

<D>__{hello?}

<A>__{claire and cooper, out on a walk, emerge onto large rocks at the water's edge. claire tosses a long stick for cooper, who bolts out onto the long wooden dock. claire gazes at the lighthouse across the lake and a long bridge in the distance. cooper starts barking and looking down into the water. claire arrives at cooper's side and stares down into the dark water.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{cooper...what do you see?}
<A>__{she looks down and sees nothing but her own reflection. after a moment, she notices a faint white shape directly in the reflection of her face. cooper rumbles a low growl. the shape seems to be gaining definition. rrring! claire gasps quietly, then reaches into a pocket in her sweater and pulls out a cordless phone.}

<L>__{interior living room afternoon}
<A>__{claire sits frozen, cello between her legs, bow hovering in position. after an uncomfortable long pause, she touches bow to string, drawing in a breath at the power of the sound. claire takes another deep breath, then launches into a beautiful and melancholy piece of music. she's very, very good. eyes closed. her body begins to sway slightly as her left hand vibratos like butterfly wings on the neck. she reaches a difficult transition and falters. she seems almost surprised. she attacks the transition again, and again falters. claire bites her lower lip and tries yet again, this time failing completely. she sits back in the chair, despondent. almost as an afterthought, she sadly drags the bow across strings. at the end of the tone, something catches her ear. she can just make out the hint of a faint feminine voice echoing the tone. she sits up and plays a different note, then another. each time the soft mournful voice becomes more distinct. finally she plays a sharp, higher pitched note. the voice echoes with a distinct, unsettling shriek. crash!}
