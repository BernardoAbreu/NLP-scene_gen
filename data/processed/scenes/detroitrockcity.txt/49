<L>__{interior father mcnulty's office day}
<A>__{the father taps his pencil looking impatiently at jam who has totally withdrawn. he sits motionless staring into space.}
<C>__{father mcnulty}
<D>__{jeremiah, are you aware you need to answer these questions, not just listen to them? jeremiah?}
<A>__{jam doesn't respond.}
<C>__{father mcnulty}
<D>__{please don't become difficult this early in your stay. i hate disciplining boys before i get to know them.}
<A>__{a nun enters knocking.}
<C>__{nun}
<D>__{forgive me, father. a young man here with a pizza for you?}
<C>__{father mcnulty}
<D>__{ah, yes! send him in sister conimaria.}
<A>__{the nun exits and a second later hawk enters wearing lex's baseball cap pulled down over his eyes.}
<C>__{father mcnulty}
<D>__{well, what's the damage, pizza fellow?}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{ten even.}
<A>__{the priest swivels his chair around and unlocks a box labelled "donations." while he looks for cash, hawk gives jam a discreet kick in the shin. jam looks up and recognizes hawk. he then looks out the window seeing trip, lex, and the volvo below. for the first time we see what jam looks like with a big, fat, shit eating grin on his face.}
<C>__{hawk}
<P>__{(whispering to jam)}
<D>__{if he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check?}
<C>__{jam}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{check.}
<A>__{father mcnulty swivels back around with a ten.}
<C>__{father mcnulty}
<D>__{here's ten and i'm donating your tip to the church. the lord thanks you.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{tell the big guy not to mention it.}
<A>__{hawk takes the ten, tips the brim of the baseball cap and leaves, giving jam a cautious wink as he goes.}
<C>__{father mcnulty}
<D>__{and not a moment too soon. i'm famished. i hope you brought a lunch for yourself.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{no, but i'm not hungry anyway.}
<A>__{father mcnulty raises his eyebrows, then opens the pizza box.}
<C>__{father mcnulty}
<D>__{well! it finally speaks. there's one barrier we've broken through.}
<A>__{father mcnulty smiles, taking a big bite. jam smiles for an entirely different reason. the priest mumbles with a mouthful.}
<C>__{father mcnulty}
<D>__{you know, your coming here reminds me of a gospel called the prodigal son.}
<A>__{jam grins a bit feigning interest.}
<C>__{father mcnulty}
<D>__{there was once a farmer who had two sons. both grew up on the farm, helping their father until...}
<P>__{(suddenly alarmed)}
<D>__{gyyaack!}
<A>__{father mcnulty gags sticking his pizza covered tongue out. he pours himself a glass of wine and sucks it down looking concerned for the moment. finally, he belches.}
<C>__{father mcnulty}
<D>__{that was a very stale mushroom.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{where was i?... ah, yes, one day the elder son decided to leave the farm...}
