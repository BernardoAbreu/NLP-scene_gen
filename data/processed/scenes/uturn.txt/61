<A>__{a light is on in the bedroom window. after a moment it dims and the house is dark, silhouetted against the horizon by moonlight. bobby steps into frame, carrying an iron pipe.}

<A>__{we start close on grace a key slapping against her buttocks as bedsprings groan. we reveal grace copulating on all fours with jake from behind.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{ya little bitch, you like it don't you! you like it this way rough and hard. gotta go fuck around on me, like your mama, but you always gotta come home to daddy, don't you, cause you know daddy's the best.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{you been a bad girl, grace. you took my heart from your mama, didn't ya? you betrayed her! like you did me. there ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{oh no! oh please forgive me, papa!}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{you broke her heart! you broke your mama's heart. you stole me! that's right. fuck it away. but it ain't ever goin' away, cause your mama she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{no! no! please!}
<A>__{he hits her. harder. in a strange flashback of his mind, he now sees grace's mama beneath him, receiving his punishment. he stops, abruptly. he can't go on. fear coming into his eyes. he starts to whimper, begging for his punishment and or forgiveness.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{oh baby, i'm so sorry... i'm so sorry...}
<P>__{(he starts to cry)}
<D>__{i didn't mean to hurt you so bad. it just...got away...}
<A>__{he drops down, burying his face between grace's legs.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{forgive me, baby, forgive me!}
<A>__{he hides there from the world that he has created, crying to himself. grace has an unreadable expression, but that's certainly not a new occurrence in their strange relationship.}
