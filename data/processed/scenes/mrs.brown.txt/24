<L>__{exterior osborne house day}
<A>__{the horse carrier pulls up outside the servant's entrance and the driver opens the doors. john brown pulls out a watch from his waistcoat and checks the time. his eyes narrow critically.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{i was due at a quarter past one.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you're late.}
<L>__{interior osborne house, corridor day}
<A>__{a few minutes later, john brown strides down the long corridor with ponsonby at his side. their journey takes them down an endless series of corridors, past servants and householders hurrying about their duties. the presence of the dead albert is felt all around in the black wreathed portraits and busts that crop up along the way. brown and ponsonby could not be more contrasted.}
<C>__{ponsonby}
<P>__{(in low tones)}
<D>__{her majesty's routine at osborne house is not as you will remember it. the household remains in full mourning and no one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever. as for the queen's routine, she breakfasts at nine thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five. no one is allowed to leave the building while the queen is at home. on the rare occasions when she is out, you may ask permission to leave, but only with my consent. you're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock. you'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{how will i know?}
<C>__{ponsonby}
<P>__{(surprised to be interrupted)}
<D>__{i'm sorry?}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{how will i know what she requires?}
<C>__{ponsonby}
<D>__{you'll be sent a message.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{who'll bring it to me?}
<C>__{ponsonby}
<D>__{her highness' equerry.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{i need a man who knows where i am.}
<C>__{ponsonby}
<D>__{i'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{that's not good enough.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{ponsonby}
<D>__{then we'll have to see what can be arranged.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{aye, do.}
<A>__{ponsonby stiffens. a beat.}
<C>__{ponsonby}
<D>__{there is to be no communication with other members of the household on matters concerning the court except through myself or one of the equerries. no plans must be altered unless you are given prior authority by myself or a senior member of the household.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{i came down at the queen's request. i will take my orders from her.}
<C>__{ponsonby}
<D>__{in matters concerning the household, i act on her behalf.}
<A>__{brown takes the measure of him.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{do you?}
<C>__{ponsonby}
<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i do.}
<A>__{brown glances up the corridor.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{so, is passing wind out of the question or do i need permission for that?}
<A>__{ponsonby refuses to acknowledge what he has heard. they reach the door of the royal chamber and he concludes the interview.}
<C>__{ponsonby}
<D>__{as i am sure you remember from balmoral, you do not talk while in her majesty's presence unless her majesty addresses you directly.}
<A>__{brown refuses to answer, so ponsonby knocks. after a moment, the door is opened by lady ely who ushers them in.}
