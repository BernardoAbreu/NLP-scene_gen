<L>__{interior fancy restaurant night}
<A>__{a waiter clears the dishes away from evan and andrea's table.}
<B>__{reveal andrea}
<A>__{her hair now has gray streaks. as she signs for the bill, she leans over and kisses evan on the cheek.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{please, mom. people will talk.}
<C>__{andrea}
<D>__{i can't help it. i'm just so proud of you. you've got the highest grades in all of your classes.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{did da jason get good grades?}
<C>__{andrea}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{please. he got straight a's without ever touching a book. that was the one area where his memory never failed him.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{ma? did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time?}
<A>__{andrea's smile fades.}
<C>__{andrea}
<D>__{why do you ask?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{no, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, i just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.}
<C>__{andrea}
<D>__{when he was around your age... almost exactly your age. he said he figured out a trick to remember the past.}
<A>__{evan tries not to react.}
<C>__{andrea}
<D>__{i couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. you know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them...}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{sure...}
<C>__{andrea}
<D>__{and then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{what? what could he do?}
<A>__{andrea shakes her head.}
<C>__{andrea}
<D>__{forget it. it's nothing. he was far too sick by then.}
<A>__{evan nods, but something gnaws beneath the surface.}
