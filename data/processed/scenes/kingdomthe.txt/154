<L>__{interior unknown room next moment}
<A>__{huge man attacks janet. vicious hand to hand blows. still tied, leavitt does what he can, kicking at the attacker. adrenaline morphs janet from scared and out sized to desperate and equally vicious. this is saving private ryan shit with leavitt as the observer. he's no coward he's doing everything he can. huge man overtakes janet, slow choking her... she's gasping, dying... janet has a knife out and is shredding the big man's back right thigh and ass. both screaming. from nowhere, fleury ends the fight with a butt end baseball swing of the shot gun to huge man's head. janet: fucked up, but alive.}

<P>__{(to leavitt)}
<D>__{sykes is going to kick your ass.}
<A>__{al ghazi follows fleury into the room. leaning to janet, fleury sees leavitt, puts his hand on his head. leavitt's somewhere else, tears in his eyes, just taking deep, measured breaths.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{everybody ok?}
<A>__{slow nods from leavitt and janet as fleury cuts adam's ties.}
<C>__{fleury}
<D>__{there's at least three more of them.}
<A>__{as janet's eyes catch on something: a sheet half assed backdrop hung from the ceiling has been nearly pulled down exposing a crude square cut out of the wall a path into another apartment. janet points to the hole in the wall. this isn't over: a seven year old girl peers out at her, shaking, tears in her eyes. janet tries her best motherly smile.}
<C>__{janet mayes}
<D>__{it's okay little one.}
<A>__{the little girl backs away. janet gets up, steers leavitt outside. sits him down. hands him a glock. fleury and al ghazi step through the hole. janet follows. a blood trail snakes through little one's room, out her door, and deeper into another apartment. little girl long gone into the main part of the apartment. then, arabic screams, the metal crashing sound of automatic gunfire. sirens overheard outside now.}
