<A>__{back in the queens apartment, ben still hasn't gotten any sleep. on the wall, he is assembling all the newspaper clippings, articles and photographs that gary sent him. each and every mirror in angela's apartment has been covered with sheets, blankets, old rags anything he could find to neutralize the reflective surfaces. with the phone cradled between his ear and shoulder he is in the middle of a heated conversation }

<D>__{...look up esseker... yes, echo, sierra, sierra, echo, kilo, echo, romeo... esseker. no idea, my guess is that it's a name... no, i haven't got a first name. yes, in new york. over the past five or six years. i know it's hazy but that's all i've got. i already looked it up in the phone book. i also called someone at the irs and at the dmv, but nothing there. it's very important larry. you'll call me back? ok...}
<A>__{ben hangs up the phone and remains in front of the wall covered with clippings for a moment. now he can have a clear overview of gary's investigative research. all the articles date back approximately to the same period and are all related to the fire that ravaged mayflower five years ago. but not a hint of esseker. ben studies the newspaper clippings, trying to piece the story together " deadly fire at mayflower 29 dead and 78 wounded " " brutal massacre mother and her three daughters slaughtered..." " ...the children, drowned, in the bathtub... " " ...the throat slit open... " " mayflower's security guard taken in for questioning... " " the night watchman confesses to setting the fire but firmly denies the accusation of murdering his family... " " terrence berry confesses but claims the mirrors are guilty the security guard at mayflower finally confesses. he started the fire in the department store with the intention of destroying the mirrors, responsible, according to him, for the death of his wife and three daughters. " ben observes terrence berry's face in one of the archive photographs. he looks like a perfectly normal guy, rather kind, surely he was a good father... ben can't help but empathize with him. as he looks up, ben catches a glimpse of his reflection in the window what if he too lost his mind and went on to slaughter his family? or what if the mirrors would do it? the phone rings }
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{yes, so, what'd you find out? nothing under that name? shit, shit, shit, shit... can you look up berry, terrence berry...}
<A>__{ben holds on the line, for a moment.}
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{...got anything? great...no, i already know all that. is he still alive? no... can you find out where he was committed before his death? wait, i'm writing it down...}
<A>__{ben sits down on the bed and scribbles down the address on a piece of paper.}
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{...roosevelt psychiatric detention center... yeah, i know where it is. thanks.}
<A>__{he hangs up the phone. under the blanket, next to him, he spots the t shirt that his sister was wearing the other night. the pain is too strong. he cannot hold back his tears anymore and starts crying.}
