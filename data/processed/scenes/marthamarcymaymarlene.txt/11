<L>__{interior diner day}
<A>__{martha sits alone in a booth hunched over a grilled cheese sandwich and french fries. she devours the food like she hasn't eaten in days. the entrance bell rings. martha turns around and cautiously peers over the booth. a family walks in. they are seated. martha returns to eating.}
<C>__{man's voice }
<D>__{marcy may?}
<A>__{it is watts. his voice paralyzes her.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{what are you doin'?}
<A>__{martha stops eating. he slides into the booth and sits across from her. watts reaches over and takes some french fries. he eats them slowly, enjoying every bite. she can't look at him.}
<C>__{watts }
<D>__{we were worried about you.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{i'm fine.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{patrick's worried about you.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{i just wanted to come into town.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{i could've brought you.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{i wanted to walk.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{through the woods?}
<C>__{waitress}
<P>__{(to watts)}
<D>__{can i get you something?}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{waitress}
<P>__{(to martha)}
<D>__{you done?}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{the waitress goes to take martha's plate. watts puts his hand out to stop her.}
<C>__{watts}
<P>__{(to martha)}
<D>__{you not gonna eat that?}
<A>__{watts takes the half grilled cheese sandwich and stuffs it into his mouth. the waitress clears the plate. watts takes martha's napkin and wipes the grease from his hands and mouth while he chews.}
<C>__{watts }
<D>__{you ready to go?}
<A>__{martha doesn't respond.}
<C>__{watts }
<D>__{come on!}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{not right now.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{no?}
<A>__{the waitress drops the check on the table. watts stares at martha for another moment before reaching into his pocket to pull out a mess of small papers. he sorts through them and separates a $20 bill. he stuffs the rest of the papers back into his pocket. he grabs her hand, places the money in her palm and grips it closed.}
<C>__{watts }
<D>__{i will get this.}
<A>__{he lets go. her hand goes limp and the money falls on the table. she does not look at him. he leans in and forces eye contact with her. watts, growing increasingly tense, stands up and glances around the diner. it is very busy. he does not want to make a scene in front of all these people. he leans down and kisses martha on the cheek. she doesn't kiss back. he holds his forehead to her forehead until she reacts. she reluctantly kisses him on the lips. martha watches him walk outside. as soon as his back is turned, she gets up, runs through the diner, and suddenly cuts through the kitchen.}
