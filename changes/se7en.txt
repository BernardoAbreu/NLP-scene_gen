<LOC>__{EXT.  COUNTRY CHURCH -- DAY}
<ACTION>__{The white cross on the church steeple stands against blue sky. The church bell rings, resonating. Mass has let out.  Small church, small congregation.  The dirt road in front is lined with pick-up trucks and parishioners on foot heading to outlying farms and homes.  An old two-story house sits across the road.  Lone.}
<LOC>__{INT.  OLD HOUSE -- DAY}
<ACTION>__{Sunlight comes through the soot on the windows, more brown than bright.  SOMERSET, 45, in a suit and tie, stands in this empty second-story room.  He looks around, at the ceiling, at the worn wooden floor, at the peeling wallpaper on the walls. Somerset walks to one wall where the current wallpaper is peeled away to reveal flowery wallpaper underneath.  He runs his finger across one of the pale red roses that decorates the older paper. He pushes the grime away, brings the rose out more clearly. He pulls at the edge of the paper, carefully ripping off a roughly squared section with the rose at its center. He studies it in his hand.}

<LOC>__{INT.  AMTRACK TRAIN -- DAY -- (CREDIT SEQUENCE BEGINS)}
<ACTION>__{Somerset is in a window seat, smoking a cigarette, looking out the speeding train.  He is near the back of the car, away from the few other passengers. Outside, farms, small homes and lawns pass.  The entire panorama is dappled by the rays of the soon setting sun. The light flickers across Somerset's placid face.}
<LOC>__{INT.  AMTRACK TRAIN -- LATER DAY}
<ACTION>__{The train is nearly full.  Somerset has his suitcase on the aisle seat beside him.  He has a hardcover book unopened on his lap.  He still stares out the window, but his disposition has soured.  The train is passing an ugly, swampy field. A car's burnt-out skeleton sits rusting in the bracken.  A little further on, two dogs are fighting, circling, attacking, their coats matted with blood. Somerset turns his head to watch the dogs. Away in the field, another dog sprints to join the fight.}
<LOC>__{INT.  AMTRACK TRAIN -- EARLY EVENING}
<ACTION>__{Passing urban streets below.  Slums.  Smashed cars.  People stand on the corners, under the bleak glow of street lamps. Somerset's suitcase is by the window.  Somerset is now in the aisle seat, reading his book.}
<LOC>__{INT.  SOMERSET'S APARTMENT -- LATER NIGHT -- (END CREDITS)}
<ACTION>__{Curtains closed.  The SOUNDS of the CITY are here as they will be everywhere in this story.  A CAR ALARM SHRIEKS.  Somerset's life is packed in many moving boxes, except for clothing in a closet and hundreds of books on shelves. Somerset, dressed only in his underwear, lays back on the bed. He reaches to the nightstand, to a wooden, pyramidical metronome. He frees the metronome's weighted swingarm so it moves back and forth.  Swings to the left... TICK, swings to the right... TICK. Tick, tick, tick, measured and steady. Somerset situates on the bed, closes his eyes.  The metronome's ticking competes with the sound of the car alarm.  Somerset's face tightens as he concentrates on the metronome. His eyes close tighter. Tick, tick, tick... the swingarm moves evenly.  Somerset's breathing deepens.  The car ALARM seems QUIETER. Tick, tick, tick.  Somerset continues his concentration. The METRONOME is the ONLY SOUND.  Somerset's face relaxes slightly as he begins to fall asleep.  Tick, tick, tick...}

<ACTION>__{DAVID MILLS, 31, exits with a bagged 40oz bottle of beer.  He is a lean, attractive man, constantly coiled, eyes always smoldering.  FOLLOW as he walks quickly past iron-gated storefronts.  He crosses the street under elevated subway tracks.  A train roars overhead. Mills watches it as he walks on. Blue sparks spit off the third rail and illuminate Mills, throwing his shadow long down the deserted street.}
<LOC>__{EXT.  URBAN STREET OF ROW HOMES -- NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{This rotting neighborhood lives in the shadow of a single fat skyscraper.  Mills walks, looks at the broken refrigerators and pieces of junk in the gutter. Ahead in the street, TWO YOUNG THUGS struggle with a crowbar to break into the trunk of a parked car. Mills draws near.  One thug looks up, doesn't think Mills will be a problem, continues prying.  Mills stops, calm.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(steps forward)}
<DIAL>__{You can fucking suck my...}
<ACTION>__{Mills swiftly finishes that sentence by smashing his bottle against the first thug's head.  The thug falls, swings blindly. The second thug moves from the side, brings out a knife. Mills averts, swings, pounds the side of his fist into the second thug's face -- CRACK.  Broken nose. The second thug stumbles back, drops the knife, his nose squirting blood. Mills turns, enraged, breathing hard. The first thug is screaming, trying to stand.  Mills takes one step, punts the first thug's head.  The crowbar clatters away. Mills is in the process of kicking a man when he's down, when the second thug grabs him from behind, pulls him backwards. Mills clutches at the thug's arm, trying to avoid a choke-hold. They both struggle spastically.  The thug's winning. Gurgling, gasping for air, Mills shifts his weight, drops to one knee and spins the thug, slamming him against the car. Mills breaks loose, grabs a handful of the second thug's hair and holds the man's head against the car's side window.  Mills' free hand pounds the thug's face: once, twice -- third time's the charm as the window shatters.  The thug goes out cold. Mills backs off, still incensed.  He rubs his throat, looking at the two prone men.  Slowly, he regains some composure. He takes a keychain from his pocket.  He unlocks the door of the car, loads one of the thugs into the back seat.  He walks to collect the other thug off the street.}

<ACTION>__{It is barely becoming light outside.  Mills can't sleep. Alone in a double bed.  He sits up, frustrated.  Sits on the edge of the bed and looks around.  The room is a shambles, filled with moving boxes. The light coming through the window glows upon a football trophy on one box.  Large and noble, a golden player stands in frozen motion at the trophy's pinnacle. Mills looks at the trophy and a fond smile forms on his face. The CLINKING of DISHES and SILVERWARE is HEARD from another room.  Mills looks at the closed bedroom door, troubled.}

<ACTION>__{Across a living room full of boxes, TRACY MILLS, 30, a beautiful woman, stands in her bathrobe.  She's upset about something, takes dishes out of boxes, puts them on the kitchenette counter. She pulls a mug from a clump of newspaper and pours some tea from a pot on the stove.  Blowing on the steaming tea, she leans back on the counter, looks over at the closed bedroom door. The tea is too hot to sip, and as Tracy is placing the mug on the counter behind her the PHONE RINGS.  Startled, she releases the mug too close to the edge.  It falls -- Crashes to the floor, shatters.}

The sizable kitchen table's green tablecloth is covered with soiled paper plates.  The plates hold bits of half-eaten sandwiches, potatoes, donuts and other junk-food remnants. Mills and Somerset turn on their flashlights.  Mills points his at the green bulb above.  Aluminum foil has been wrapped around the bulb to focus the light on the corpse. Somerset sweeps the room with his flashlight.  He goes to the body and kneels beside it.  There's a rope tied around the man's wide gut.  Mills comes to stand beside Somerset.}

<ACTION>__{Somerset enters from the room of notebooks.  This is John Doe's art studio.  Windowless, with several easels holding paintings in various states of completion.  The walls are covered with photos and finished canvases, except for one wall which is blank white.  Somerset turns the lights off. There is a 16mm film projector on a table, facing the blank wall.  Somerset turns the projector on.  It clatters to life, running a piece of film. The film is spliced into a non-stop loop. Somerset watches the wall, light strobing across him. The projector shows an image of clouds drifting, with strange, superimposed angels in flowing robes floating jerkily.  It's like an old, Hollywood version of heaven. The image switches abruptly to fire and tormented souls laboring around a pit of molten goo.  Like Heaven, it's a scratched piece of film from Hollywood's early days. Somerset turns to examine one of the paintings on an easel.  The painting has been skillfully rendered, in small, controlled brush strokes.  It shows a modern city street, stylized, dark. The city is peopled by mutated humans and freakish beasts. Sinners in the streets, killing, raping, pillaging.  Buildings are burning, blood is being spilled.  It's dense with detail. Somerset walks to another painting which is covered by a drop cloth.  He removes the cloth, uncovers a huge canvas.  We do not see the painting, but when Somerset does his features turn grim.}
