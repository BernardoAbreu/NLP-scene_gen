<A>__{pedestrians and passerbys drawn to the commotion at the nomad, the bottleneck bogs traffic down, making it impossible to move. elmore crouches low as police and emergency personnel cross in front of the car... slowly, the crosswalk begins to thin and then finally clear...save a single man: messner...standing right in front of the barracuda, staring at the tires, staring at elmore. the two lock eyes as he moves around to the driver's side, reaching into his pocket elmore lifts the colt up off his lap, putting his heavily bandaged hand on the wheel. then he sees messner's fbi creds, clipped to his belt can't tell if this one's legit. he sets the colt down on the floorboard as messner walks up, pulling a plastic bag from his pocket: the one containing three severed fingers. he glances down at elmore's mummified left hand, holding out the bag for him to take. elmore, unsure, accepting the bag, seeing what's inside, embarrassed by it he sets it down on the seat next to him.}
