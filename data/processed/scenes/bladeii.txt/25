<A>__{blade wakes up, lifts his head. a shaft of sunlight shines directly down onto him, reflecting back at us from his now adult eyes. blade hasn't moved. he sits in the chair in front of the cell door which is now silent. he stands, unlocking the cell door. he heaves the cross bar away. the door groans as he opens it.}

<A>__{blade enters. it's dark. we can just make out whistler's figure huddled in the corner like some kind of caged animal, his lanky, gray hair obscuring his face. whistler doesn't stir. blade crosses over to the steel shutters. for the briefest moments, he hesitates. then he hits the switch, readying his shotgun. with a hum, the shutters rise, throwing a shaft of blinding sunlight over whistler. nothing happens. blade lowers his shotgun. whistler slowly raises his head, fixing blade with a bloodshot eye.}
