<D>__{search him. then i will kill you.}
<A>__{the thug, terrified, pulls out gordon's badge, wallet, gun...and the folded papers of the speech he did not read. bane takes these one by one with quick glances. he stops at the papers. unfolds them... as he reads, gordon rolls off the steps, dropping into the rushing flow of water gunshots ring out...}
