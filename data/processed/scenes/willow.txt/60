<C>__{willow}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{raziel}
<D>__{kill him!}
<A>__{madmartigna hesitates but then smashes the boy back into the lake. the boy surfaces like a dolphin. his shape begins to change, becoming fish like, diving and vanishing. then: he attacks the boat! he is now a ferocious shark like monster. he chomps the boat and the gold branches slide into the water. madmartigan bashes the monster with the oar, then grabs an anchor. the mon ster attacks again and madmartigan jabs its gill with the anchor. the monster sinks into the lake. they all sigh with relief. madmartigan shrugs proudly. suddenly the an chor line unravels, tangling madmartigan's legs in fishing nets and yanking him overboard. underwater, madmartigan swirls behind the monster. he pulls himself along the anchor line and finally cuts himself free with his dagger. he surfaces and madly swims toward the pitching boat. willow reaches out to him. the monster surfaces and circles the boat. then it attacks madmartigan.}

<A>__{willow digs out a magic acorn. but he drops it! he fumbles in the leaking boat and finally finds it. the monster opens its jaws and goes to devour madmartigan. willow throws the acorn. the monster miraculously turns to stone. madmartigan grabs the boat and watches in amazement as the monster sinks. willow hauls him into the boat.}
