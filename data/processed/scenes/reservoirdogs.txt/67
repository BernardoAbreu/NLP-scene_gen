<L>__{interior warehouse day}
<A>__{medium shot on the door. nice guy eddie, mr. white and mr. pink walk through it. they stop in their tracks. we see what they see. mr. blonde, lying on the ground, shot full of holes. the cop slumped over in his chair, a bloody mess, mr. orange lying at the cop's feet, holding his wound. eddie, mr. white and mr. pink walk into the shot.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{what the fuck happened here?}
<A>__{eddie runs over to his friend mr. blonde toothpick vic.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<P>__{(to mr. orange)}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{mr. orange}
<P>__{(very weakly)}
<D>__{blonde went crazy. he slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{who cares what he was gonna do to this fuckin pig?}
<A>__{eddie whips out his gun and shoots the cop. the cop and the chair tip over. eddie stands over him and shoots him once more.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(to mr. orange)}
<D>__{you were saying he went crazy? something like that? worse or better?}
<C>__{mr. orange}
<D>__{look, eddie, he was pullin a burn. he was gonna kill the cop and me. and when you guys walked through the door, he was gonna blow you to hell and make off with the diamonds.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<P>__{(to eddie)}
<D>__{uhuh, uhuh, what's i tell ya? that sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho.}
<C>__{mr. orange}
<P>__{(to eddie)}
<D>__{you could've asked the cop, if you didn't just kill him. he talked about what he was going to do when he was slicing him up.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i don't buy it. it doesn't make sense.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{it makes perfect fuckin sense to me. eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.}
<A>__{mr. pink walks over to the cop's body.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{he's right about the ear, it's hacked off.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(to mr. orange)}
<D>__{let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. according to you, mr. blonde was gonna kill you. then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. that's your story? i'm correct about that, right?}
<C>__{mr. orange}
<D>__{eddie, you can believe me or not believe me, but it's the truth. i swear on my mother's eternal soul that's what happened.}
<A>__{the camera mover into a c.u. of nice guy eddie. there's a long pause while he rolls over what mr. orange has said. finally:}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{you're a fuckin liar. now why don't you drop the fuckin fairy tale and tell me what really happened?}
<C>__{mr. white }
<D>__{he told you what really happened. you just can't deal with it.}
<C>__{mr. orange }
<D>__{okay, you're right, i'm lying. even though i'm fuckin dyin i'm not above pullin a fast one. get rid of blonde, we share his split no, scratch that, i shot him 'cause i didn't like his hair style. i didn't like his shoes either. if it has just been his hair, i'd've maybe, maybe i said, let him live. but hair and footwear together, he's a goner.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{the man you killed was just released from prison. he got caught at a company warehouse full of hot items. he could've walked away. all he had to do was say my dad's name. but instead he shut his mouth and did his time. he did four years for us, and he did 'em like a man. and we were very grateful. so, mr. orange, you're tellin me this very good friend of mine, who did four years for my father, who in four years never made a deal, no matter what they dangled in front of him, you're telling me that now, that now this man is free, and we're making good on our commitment to him, he's just gonna decide, right out of the fuckin blue, to rip us off?}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{mr. orange, why don't you tell me what really happened?}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{why? it'll just be more bullshit.}
<A>__{eddie steps out of his c.u. and we see joe cabot standing in the warehouse doorway. he walks into the room.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(pointing to mr. orange)}
<D>__{this man set us up.}
<A>__{camera does a 360 around the men.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{daddy, i'm sorry, i don't know what's happening.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{that's okay, eddie, i do.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<P>__{(to joe)}

<C>__{joe}
<D>__{aren't you?}
<C>__{mr. orange }
<D>__{i don't have the slightest fuckin idea what you're talkin about.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<P>__{(very calmly to joe)}
<D>__{joe, i don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong.}
<C>__{joe}

<P>__{(very calmly)}
<D>__{joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. he's a good kid. i understand you're hot, you're super fuckin pissed. we're all real emotional. but you're barking up the wrong tree. i know this man, and he wouldn't do that.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you don't know jack shit. i do. this rotten bastard tipped off the cops and got mr. brown and mr. blue killed.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{mr. blue's dead?}

<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{the motherfucker killed vic.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{how do you know all this?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{he was the only one i wasn't a hundred percent on. i should have my fucking head examined for goin forward when i wasn't a hundred percent. but he seemed like a good kid, and i was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{that's your proof?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you don't need proof when you got instinct. i ignored it before, but not no more.}
<A>__{he whips out a revolver and aims it at mr. orange. mr. white brings his .45 up at joe. eddie and mr. pink are shook awake by the flash of firearms. eddie raises his gun, pointing it at mr. white.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{have you lost your fucking mind? put your gun down!}
<A>__{mr. pink fades into the b.g., wanting no part of this.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{joe, you're making a terrible mistake i can't let you make.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{stop pointing your fuckin gun at daddy!}
<A>__{joe, never taking his eyes off mr. orange.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{don't worry, eddie. me and larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot. we like each other too much.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{joe, if you kill that man, you die nexterior repeat, if you kill that man, you die next!}
<A>__{we get many different angles of the mexican standoff.}
<B>__{mediums on everybody}
<A>__{mr. orange holding his belly, looking from left to right. joe pointing down on mr. orange. not taking his eyes off him. mr. white pointing at joe, looking like he's ready to start firing any minute. eddie scared shitless for his father, gun locked on mr. white. mr. pink walking backwards away from the action. nobody says nothing.}
<B>__{four shot}
<A>__{of guys ready for violence. mr. pink in the b.g.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{c'mon, guys, nobody wants this. we're supposed to me fuckin professionals!}
<A>__{joe raises his head to mr. white.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{larry, i'm gonna kill him.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{goddamn you, joe, don't make me do this!}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{larry, i'm askin you to trust me on this.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{don't ask me that.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i'm not askin, i'm betting.}
<A>__{joe's eyes go back to mr. orange.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{daddy, don't!}
<A>__{joe fires three times, hitting mr. orange with every one. mr. white shoots joe twice in the face. joe brings his hands up to his face, screaming, and falls to the ground. eddie fires at mr. white, hitting him three times in the chest. mr. white brings his gun around on eddie and shoots him. the two men fall to their knees, firing at each other. eddie collapses, dead. joe's dead. mr. orange lies perfectly still, except for his chest heaving. the only sound we hear is his loud breathing. mr. white is shot full of holes, but still on his knees, not moving. mr. pink is standing motionless. finally he grabs the satchel of diamonds and runs out the door. we hear outside a car start. then the sound of a bullhorn yells out:}
<C>__{police force }
<D>__{freeze! get out of the car and lie face down on the ground!}
<C>__{mr. pink }
<D>__{don't shoot!}
<A>__{we now hear sirens, the sounds of more cars driving up, men running to the warehouse. while all this noise is going on, mr. white tries to stand but falls down. he somehow makes it to where mr. orange lies. he lifts mr. orange's head, cradling it in his lap and stroking his brow.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<P>__{(with much effort)}
<D>__{sorry, kid. looks like we're gonna do a little time.}
<A>__{mr. orange looks up at him and, with even more of an effort:}
<C>__{mr. orange}
<D>__{i'm a cop.}
<A>__{mr. white doesn't say anything, he keeps stroking orange's brow.}
<C>__{mr. orange}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i'm so sorry.}
<A>__{mr. white lifts his .45 and places the barrel between mr. orange's eyes. the camera moves into an extreme c.u. of mr white. the sounds of outside storm inside. we don't see anything, but we hear a bunch of shotguns cocking.}
<C>__{police force }
<D>__{freeze, motherfucker! drop your fucking gun!}
<A>__{mr white looks up at them, smiles, pulls the trigger.}
<B>__{bang}
<A>__{we hear a burst of shotgun fire. mr. white is blown out of frame, leaving it empty.}
