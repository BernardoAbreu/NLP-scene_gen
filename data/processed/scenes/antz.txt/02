<L>__{interior motivational counsellor's office day}
<A>__{we join z, a worker ant with issues. he's lying on a couch, recounting his woes.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{i feel...isolated. different. i've got abandonment issues. my father flew away when i was just a larva. my mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i feel physically inadequate i've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight. sometimes i think i'm just not cut out to be a worker. but i don't have any other options. i was assigned to trade school when i was just a grub. the whole system just...makes me feel...insignificant.}
<C>__{motivational counsellor}
<P>__{(enthusiastic)}
<D>__{terrific! you should feel insignificant!}
<A>__{for the first time, we see the ant motivational counsellor. he's a mixture of tony robbins and ron popiel (the hyperactive late night tv huckster, and founder of "ronco").}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{...i should?}
<C>__{motivational counsellor}
<P>__{(hopping around enthusiastically)}
<D>__{yes!!! you know, people ask me, "doctor, why are you always happy?" and i tell them it's mind over matter. i don't mind that i don'tmatter! do you get it? do you get it?}
<A>__{z gives a fake smile.}
<C>__{motivational counsellor}
<P>__{(incredibly "up")}
<D>__{z, we're part of the fastest growingspecies in the whole world!}
<A>__{the counsellor rolls down a chart from the wall. an arrow shows ant population going up, up, up.}
<C>__{motivational counsellor}
<D>__{ask me why we're so successful.}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{why are we so successful?}
<C>__{motivational counsellor}
<D>__{i'm glad you asked me that question!}
<A>__{the motivational counsellor opens some blinds...and we see a vista of the ant filled chamber below.}
<C>__{motivational counsellor}
<D>__{what do you see out there?}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{...ants...}
<C>__{motivational counsellor}
<D>__{right! ants! millions of creatures, each with his assigned task, all pulling together!}
<A>__{down below, we see a group of ants carrying a boulder up an incline. one worker ants slips, and the boulder rolls down, crushing his leg. the other ants rush over it looks like they're going to help their fallen comrade, but instead, they climb right over him, and pick up the boulder, continuing with their task.}
<C>__{motivational counsellor}
<D>__{you see? being an ant is being able to say, "hey i'm meaningless,you're meaningless."}
<C>__{z}
<D>__{but but i've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love.}
<A>__{the motivational counsellor puts his arm on z's shoulder...he seems to understand...}
<C>__{motivational counsellor}
<D>__{z...you need help.}
<P>__{(looking at a clock)}
<D>__{whoops! we're gonna have to stop there. your minute is up!}
<A>__{the counsellor ushers z out of his seat and towards the door.}
<C>__{motivational counsellor}
<D>__{now back to work! we've made realprogress! remember let's be best superorganism we can be!}
