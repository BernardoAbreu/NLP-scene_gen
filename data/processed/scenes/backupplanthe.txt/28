<L>__{interior zoe's apartment day}
<A>__{zoe is lying in bed with nuts on the pillow next to her. the sun is shining and they are both waking up. she gets up and goes to the mirror. she lifts up her nightgown and looks at her stomach, this time with a slight look of concern on her face.}
<L>__{interior equinox day}
<A>__{zoe and mona are side by side on the elliptical machines. zoe is going very fast, while mona is barely moving at all.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{what if i'm pregnant?}
<C>__{mona}
<D>__{then you'll get fat and hormonal and i will say, "i told you so."}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{but what if this could go somewhere with stan? like, really go somewhere.}
<C>__{mona}
<D>__{then it will work out perfectly.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{mona}
<D>__{because just when you really like him, you'll break up because you're pregnant and then you never have to put yourself out there and possibly get hurt. that's your dream.}
<C>__{zoe}
<P>__{(thinks, then)}
<D>__{i'm not pregnant.}
<A>__{she gets off the machine.}
