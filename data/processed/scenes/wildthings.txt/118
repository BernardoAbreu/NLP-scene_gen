<L>__{exterior the beach day}
<A>__{ray and jimmy walk along the sand, moving in the direction of the big rocks. jimmy wears sagger shorts, a surfer t shirt. ray wears a suit. he carries the coat over his shoulder.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{it's those rocks, up there.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you and suzie used to come out here together?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{yeah, sometimes. lots of the kids hang out here.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you really think something bad happened to suzie?}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(ignoring the question)}
<D>__{lombardo ever come out here?}
<A>__{jimmy looks at him, surprised, sees that ray is serious. still, the idea generates a laugh.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{i say something funny?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{no. but i mean... just the idea that mr. lombardo would...}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{way i hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{yeah, but...}
<A>__{he breaks off as ray kneels over a big flat rock. ray brushes away some sand, drapes the sport coat over his arm, taking tweezers and latex gloves from the pockets. jimmy moves closer, curious, seeing what ray sees.}
<B>__{close on gloved hands}
<A>__{as tweezers pick up two teeth from a crevice in the stone. ray straightens, holding the teeth in the palm of his hand. jimmy stares at the teeth. ray takes a couple of bills from his pocket, hands them to jimmy.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i'm going to be staying here, jimmy. you can catch a bus up there at the lot, okay?}
<A>__{jimmy looks a little sick, but he takes the money. he starts toward the lot. ray watches for a moment. then calls out to him.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{people aren't always what they appear to be, kid. remember it.}
<A>__{jimmy looks at him, trying to make sense of what ray is saying, clearly disturbed by the implications. but he asks no more questions. he turns, trudging alone back through the sand.}
