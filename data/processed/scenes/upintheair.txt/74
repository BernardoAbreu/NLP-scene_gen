<A>__{ryan looks at natalie like she's out of her mind.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{positive effect?}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{well, tests have shown that children under moderate trauma have a tendency to apply themselves academically as a method of coping.}

<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{your children's admiration is important to you?}

<A>__{bob looks up shocked and pissed.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{hey asshole, aren't you here to console me?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i'm not a shrink, bob. i'm a wake up call. you know why kids love athletes?}
<C>__{bob}

<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{exactly. well, i think fate is telling you to do something, bob.}
<A>__{bob looks up and meets eyes with ryan.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{i see guys who work for the same company their entire lives. clock in. clock out. never a moment of happiness.}
