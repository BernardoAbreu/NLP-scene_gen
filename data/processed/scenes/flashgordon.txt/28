<A>__{through the transparent walls as the spinning motion is rapidly slowing down. the three voyagers are crumpled on the floor against the wall in strange attitudes, flash's arms still holding dale. they seem semi conscious, as if dropped. an amber glow bathes them, and soon we see its source. a huge planet wheels into view through the transparent wall. it is mongo. its curved surface is a pure sea of amber fire molten lava, with great tongues of flame erupting horrifically. zarkov blinks, struggles to focus his eyes. he succeeds, with horror sees where they are headed. making a choking sound, zarkov stirs and tries to crawl over to a control panel. he pushes switches. nothing happens. the capsule keeps on going down. a great leaping tongue of fire licks it. suddenly, just as destruction seems imminent, the capsule miraculously changes its flight path and soars above the remaining flames. it races through them. a shadow passes over mongo as the capsule passes through a wall of purple vapor and emerges above a totally different landscape. a dozen various colored clouds sweep past in silent majesty. the capsule slows, hovers starts straight down into a sea of high grass.}
