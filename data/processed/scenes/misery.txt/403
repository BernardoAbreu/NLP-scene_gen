<A>__{annie, screaming, driven to the floor by the blow, the book beneath her, and the flames fly up, her sweater is starting to burn and she's covered with shards of glass from the shattered bottle of champagne and some of the manuscript is hissing from the liquid, but she is able to struggle to her knees }

<D>__{i'm going to kill you, you lying cocksucker...}
<A>__{as she struggles to her feet, she pulls out the gun and shoots at paul, hitting him in the shoulder. just as she's about to shoot again, paul quickly wheels the chair up to her, throws himself out of the chair, and tackles her. the gun flies out of her hand and lands in the hallway, going off as it lands. they wrestle on the floor. flames still around them, paul gets on top of her, grabs some burning pages, stuffs them into her mouth, shouting }
