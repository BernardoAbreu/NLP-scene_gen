<D>__{only kidding!}
<A>__{ruben pushes the 'up' button on the window, capturing andy's head in a deadlock. then he opens the door, gets out, slams door, forcing the squawking andy into a helpless frisk position. we hear helen scream, (o.s.). ignoring this, ruben begins to frisk andy. m.j. approaching in her own car, sees the action, brakes}
