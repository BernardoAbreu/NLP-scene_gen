<A>__{the goons lead chev through a posh dining area, down a dark corridor. they frisk him, finding the obvious .45 in the shoulder holster, yank it out and push him into a smoking lounge.}
<L>__{int smoking lounge, standard hotel continuous}
<A>__{carlito and ricky verona sit side by side at the table. an iced bucket of champagne, good cigars. goons chill in the corners. the whole floor has been cleared out they’ve got the place all to themselves.}

<C>__{chev}
<D>__{no shit.}
<C>__{carlito}
<D>__{why don’t you sit down?}
<C>__{verona}
<D>__{wait a minute.}
<P>__{(gesturing to the goons by the door)}
<D>__{pat him down again. he’s carrying something.}
<A>__{the goons give him another look. this time they reach down his pants and produce a second small, concealed handgun ... then discover the pager like device. one of the goons rips the tube from chev’s back chev winces in pain. his heartrate starts to slow almost immediately.}
<C>__{carlito}
<D>__{let me see that.}
<A>__{a goon tosses it to him.}
<P>__{carlito (cont’d)}
<D>__{clever ... what is this, an insulin pump?}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{basically.}
<C>__{verona}
<D>__{what the fuck is insulin?}
<A>__{carlito shuts him up with a look.}
<C>__{carlito}
<P>__{(holding the device up)}
<D>__{ephedrine, right?}
<A>__{chev nods. carlito places the device carefully on the table.}
<P>__{carlito (cont’d) (bemused)}
<D>__{very resourceful ...}
<A>__{he reaches into his coat pocket, produces a pair of black leather gloves and starts to put them on.}
<C>__{chev}
<P>__{(to verona)}
<D>__{found a new master, you little bitch, is that it?}
<C>__{verona}
<D>__{i’m nobody’s little bitch.}
<C>__{chev}
<P>__{(egging him on)}
<D>__{we’ll see what kind of a bitch you are when carlito hires you for half what he used to pay me... and you take it.}
<C>__{carlito}
<D>__{that’s enough.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{you’ll probably throw boss a nice little reach around just to show what a good bitch you are.}
<C>__{verona}
<D>__{i’m nobody’s little bitch, you hear me? he’ll pay what i tell him to pay...!}
<C>__{carlito}
<D>__{i said that’s enough.}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{it’s been a long day. but in the end, you must agree, it all works out quite nicely. don kim gets his bullet, thanks to you...}
<A>__{carlito unlatches a 2’x6” beautifully crafted mahogany wood case sitting on the table in front of him. it contains several syringes and bottle of milky fluid. he removes one syringe from the box with a gloved hand. it almost glows in the soft light.}
<P>__{carlito (cont’d)}
<D>__{... and hong kong gets a goat to take the fall. please understand, chev, it’s truly nothing personal.}
<C>__{verona}
<D>__{speak for yourself.}
<A>__{carlito squirts a little of the milky liquid.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{is that what i think it is?}
<A>__{carlito nods.}
<C>__{carlito}
<D>__{the chinese shit.}
<P>__{(nods to the goons)}
<D>__{hold him down.}
<A>__{in a flash, chev whips out a gun everyone flinches... but no, wait: he’s just holding out his fist, pointing the stick em up finger right between carlito’s eyes.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{not so fast, motherfucker.}
<A>__{for a beat, no one knows quite how to react. verona chuckles nervously.}
<C>__{verona}
<D>__{dude’s gone dipsy doodle...}
<A>__{chev whips the finger toward verona, shutting him down mid word. verona shrugs it off with less than 100% confidence... the room exhales.}
<P>__{verona (cont’d)}
<D>__{whatever, psycho...}
<C>__{carlito}
<D>__{i’m afraid the houdini act is over, chelios.}
<A>__{a goon makes a move for chev... but chev spins on him, leveling the finger at the goon’s forehead, and pulls the “trigger”...}
<C>__{chev}
<P>__{(imitating a gunshot)}
<D>__{booosh!}
<A>__{the goon’s head is rocked back, a nickel sized hole popped right through the cranium... a glorious fountain of crimson arcs from the goon’s forehead across the table, splashing into the ice bucket.}
<C>__{verona}
<P>__{(freaking)}
<D>__{ourfather whoartinheaven hallowedbethy }
<C>__{carlito}
<D>__{shut up, verona.}
<C>__{don kim}
<D>__{so this is how it is.}
<A>__{everyone turns... don kim, in a ralph lauren polo shirt and white slacks, is standing at the entrance of the bar. he’s got an asian gangster on each side, one of them holding out a smoking, silenced glock .9mm. more asian gangsters appear all around, moving in, taking position. the gangsters all look about 16 years old, dressed for a hot night at the florentine gardens... but their eyes are dead blank cold as hell.}
<C>__{verona}
<D>__{what... you... he...}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{presto.}
<A>__{one of carlito’s goons points an uzi at don kim... and is filled full of lead in the blink of an eye by a pair of asians on his blind side... who are cut to ribbons : by another of carlito’s men... and all hell breaks loose. carlito scrambles away from the table and grabs one of his goons, using him as a shield as he makes his way behind the bar... the goon absorbs a hail of bullets... verona whips out a .357 magnum, turns toward chev... summoning a surge of strength from out of his ass, chev kicks the table forward, pinning verona’s legs to the bench the ice bucket slides into chev’s lap... he snatches out a bottle of dom perignon and fastballs it at verona’s gun hand... the bottle shatters... verona bobbles the .357... it hits the ground goes off and the four fingers of verona’s right hand are vaporized. verona shrieks like a ten year old girl at a justin timberlake concert. behind the bar, carlito quickly punches up his cell phone.}

<D>__{get me out of here! now!}
