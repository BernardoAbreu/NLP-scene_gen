<L>__{interior townhouse foyer day}
<A>__{evan throws open the front door, revealing the airy foyer of the townhouse. the place is completely empty. he talks fast, races through the tour. the three of them come in, sarah still bouncing her basketball.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{this is the middle of the house, the entry floor, living room's over there. the kitchen floor's below us and there's two bedroom floors above.}
<A>__{the front door closes behind them, with a thud so authoritative it seems to say no one's ever getting out. meg tries to get her daughter's attention, to tell her to stop bouncing the ball in the house.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{it's an enormous amount of space for the money and i will be perfectly honest, the family is in no hurry whatsoever.}
<A>__{meg whispers sarah's name, but sarah still ignores her, goes on bouncing the ball.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{no ball, kid.}
<A>__{sarah immediately stops bouncing. she wanders into the living room, peers through the big french doors, which look out over the courtyard area. there's another row of brownstones on the next block, and all the patios back up to one another. it looks tranquil out there, oasis in the city. sarah leans up against the door, sighs, her breath fogs the window. there is a profound melancholy about her. meg watches her, tries to catch eyes with her in the reflection. can't. evan flings open the door of an old fashioned cage style elevator.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{working elevator. mr. pearlstine, the previous owner, was disabled the last ten years of his life. highly unusual, the elevator, you will not find this in ninety percent of brownstones.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{will they take asking price? i need a two week escrow and i'm already approved for the loan.}
<A>__{lydia turns, gives meg an "are you insane?" look.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{what say we see the house before we dicker, hmm?}
<P>__{(starting up the stairs)}
<D>__{i have to warn you, this is exactly the response we expected to get. it's a very emotional property.}
<A>__{as he disappears upstairs, lydia turns to meg, lowers her voice.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{who taught you to negotiate?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{it's not like saks', mom, you don't have to pay the price on the tag.}
<A>__{she gets in the elevator and rattles the door shut with a bang. that kid's got an attitude. meg takes a deep breath, turns to lydia. she brushes her hair behind an ear, we notice her thin hand is shaking.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{i'm sorry. apartments, and... money, and... this is more my husband's area.}
<A>__{she digs in her purse for a prescription pill bottle and some water.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{was. his area. i'm not very good at...}
<A>__{lydia watches as she swallows a pill, waiting for meg to finish her sentence. not very good at what?}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{things, and if i can't prove to my soon to be ex husband that i can provide a suitable place for our daughter to live in the next fourteen days, it's going to get ugly between us. uglier.}
<A>__{lydia just looks at her, no idea what to say. these two are from different places.}
<C>__{evan }
<P>__{(from upstairs)}
<D>__{it would be so lovely if i could shot the property before i leave!}
