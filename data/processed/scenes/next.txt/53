<A>__{liz eases away from cris, trying not to wake him. he stirs...but settles back into slumber. she slithers out of bed and tiptoes to the bathroom. silently closes the door behind her.}
<L>__{interior bathroom night}
<A>__{liz stands there in the dark, heart pounding. she sees that the window is open. she looks at it, deciding.}
<L>__{interior cabin day}
<A>__{the morning sun on cris' sleeping face. his foot slides in search of liz. not finding her, he opens his eyes. checks the clock. 10:09 am.}
<D>__{cris liz... liz?}
<A>__{no answer. he walks to the bedroom door. locked. he tries to force it. won't budge. tries the window. bars across it that weren't there before. shakes them. solidly bolted. looks outside. no one's around. he's about to shout, but stops himself. runs into the bathroom. bars over that window, too. as he stands there, trapped, ferris steps into view outside.}
