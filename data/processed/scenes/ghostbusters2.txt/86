<L>__{interior firehouse day}
<A>__{louis is lurking behind a pillar, peeking out at the office area. we pan down to the floor and see a foot pedal, then pan along the cord to a ghost trap sitting on louis's desk. hanging from strings over the desk are several pieces of kentucky fried chicken.}
<B>__{wall}
<A>__{slimer partially emerges and furtively sniffs the air, then spots the chicken bait. he licks his lips, materializes completely and flies to the chicken.}
<B>__{louis}
<A>__{his eyes light up and he stomps the foot pedal.}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(shouts)}
<D>__{gotcha!}
<B>__{desk}
<A>__{the trap pops open and shoots out a powerful cone of energy. slimer dodges it and escapes as a big section of the ceiling comes crashing down on louis's desk.}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(seeing the damage)}
<D>__{uh oh.}
<A>__{he slinks off, defeated.}
