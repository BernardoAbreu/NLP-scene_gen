<L>__{interior smoky room night}
<A>__{it has been a long day, the resistance leaders are all exhausted. beck, olbricht, witzleben, haeften and mertz watch goerdeler circling a rigid stauffenberg.}
<C>__{goerdeler}
<D>__{the point of your central solution is to replace hitler so that we can negotiate a truce with the allies. the allies, i suspect, would be more amenable to a truce... if we offer it to them before they are in fucking berlin.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{today was a matter of indecision nothing more. a military operation in the hands of a politician.}
<A>__{stauffenberg's lack of respect infuriates goerdeler.}
<C>__{goerdeler}
<D>__{i don't think i am alone when i say your judgement is in question.}
<P>__{(to the others)}
<D>__{i would like to take a vote.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{carl.}
<C>__{goerdeler}
<D>__{i demand that we relieve colonel stauffenberg.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{carl, if i may have a word with you in private.}
<C>__{goerdeler}
<D>__{if you have something to say, ludwig, say it here. say it now.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{very well. there's no need to vote.}
<A>__{beck turns to the bar, pours two drinks. stauffenberg stiffens, ready for the axe.}
<C>__{beck }
<D>__{i consider you a friend. and i look forward to the day when we can once again live as free men. but you've become a liability.}
<A>__{goerdeler smiles smugly. but the smile fades when beck turns, offering a drink to him.}
<C>__{beck }
<D>__{i'm sorry it has to be this way.}
<C>__{goerdeler}
<D>__{wha... what are you saying?}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{fellgiebel informed me this evening... himmler's issued an order for your arrest. you'll have to leave germany. tonight. when we've succeeded with the central solution you'll return as chancellor. until then }
<A>__{goerdeler stands, confronting stauffenberg.}
<C>__{goerdeler}
<D>__{this is your doing, isn't it? isn't it? you can't just get rid of me like this. i am the man germany will follow. i'm... i...}
<A>__{stauffenberg says nothing. he's too cool. goerdeler looks at the other conspirators, but no one is going to speak for him. finally, almost in tears:}
<C>__{goerdeler }
<D>__{ludwig, i }
<A>__{beck offers him an envelope.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{disappear, carl. avoid contact with anyone.}
<A>__{ugly pause. goerdeler snatches the envelope and sulks out. we could not be happier to see him go. beck coughs, turns to stauffenberg.}
<C>__{beck }
<D>__{no more indecision. from now on, stauffenberg has discretion.}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{i can't issue valkyrie again unless we follow through. if he fails to }
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{i will do my job. you just take berlin.}
