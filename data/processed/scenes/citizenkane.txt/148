<C>__{kane}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{why not? well nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead.}
<C>__{reilly}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{maybe we'd better wait for more word on the president's condition.}
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(still looking at leland)}
<D>__{what do you mean by that?}
<C>__{leland}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{competition.}

<D>__{he may recover }
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(still holding on leland)}
<D>__{what do you mean by that?}
<C>__{leland}
<P>__{(steadily)}
<D>__{yesterday morning you called the president a traitor. what do you think that crowd is doing down there? they think you murdered him.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the "enquirer" in his pocket?}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{ and that copy of the "enquirer" said the president should be killed.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{i said treason was a capital offense punishable by death }
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{you've said a lot of things about the president in the last few months.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{they're true! everything i said! witholding that veto was treason!}

<A>__{kane stops looks at him.}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{there are the people of the united states, and they are blaming you oh, i know it doesn't make any sense, but at least you can learn a lesson from it.}
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(snarling)}
<D>__{what lesson? not to expose fraud when i see it? not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property?}
<P>__{(he turns to reilly)}
<D>__{run it the way i said, reilly "this afternoon a great man was assassinated "}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{charlie! now you're not making sense.}
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{i don't have to. i run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. i can't help that. besides, they all know i'm married to his niece. i've got to think of her.}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{i've got to think of emily }

<C>__{kane}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<A>__{leland looks back at kane, is conscious of the boys standing around.}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{finish your editorial.}
<A>__{leland walks out in to the city room. more staff members in shirt sleeves in a state of panic. leland goes to his desk, takes out a bottle, pours himself a very stiff drink. a door opens. a policeman enters with bernstein. bernstein is badly battered. the boys crowd around.}
<C>__{leland}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{what's happened?}
<C>__{bernstein}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i'm all right, mr. leland. only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me. i learned 'em! didn't i, officer?}
<C>__{the cop}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{you sure did say, the commissioner said i was to stand by and protect mr. kane until further orders, no matter how he felt about it. where is he?}
<C>__{leland}
<P>__{(finishing his drink)}
<D>__{in there.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{if you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, i'd have killed them fellows.}
<C>__{leland}
<P>__{(pouring himself another drink)}
<D>__{go and get yourself washed up, mr. bernstein.}
<P>__{(he looks his face over thoroughly)}
<D>__{there doesn't seem to be an serious injury.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{not to me. but you will let that cop go home with mr. kane, won't you?}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{yes, mr. bernstein.}
<A>__{bernstein leaves the picture with sympathetic attendance. leland finishes his second drink.}
