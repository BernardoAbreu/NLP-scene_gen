<L>__{interior alien ship day}
<A>__{the doorway is a glowing geometric blur of light against blackness, spewing dust. in the darkness of the chamber are huge, formless shapes. standard, broussard and melkonis appear silhouetted against the doorway. they switch on flashlight like devices called "datasticks", and step in. carefully, peering around, they pick their way past the indistinct machinery.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{air lock?}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{who knows?}
<C>__{broussard}
<D>__{let's try and find the control room.}
<A>__{as they move their lights around, they can see that the walls, ceiling, and machinery are full of huge, irregular holes.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{look at these holes. this place looks like swiss cheese.}
<A>__{broussard shines his light up into a huge hole in the ceiling.}
<C>__{broussard}
<D>__{this hole goes up several decks looks like somebody was firing a military disintegrator in here.}
<A>__{they all peer up the hole into darkness.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{climbing gear.}
<A>__{standard draws out a stubby spear gun with a graplon attached to it. he aims it up into the hole and fires. the graplon is launched up into darkness, trailing a thin wire. there is a dull clunk, and the wire dangles.}
<C>__{broussard}
<D>__{i will go first.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{no, you'll follow me.}
<A>__{standard attaches the wire to a powered gear box on his chest, and presses a button. with a mechanical whine, he is pulled up into the hole, using his feet for leverage where he can. broussard attaches the wire to his own chest unit.}
