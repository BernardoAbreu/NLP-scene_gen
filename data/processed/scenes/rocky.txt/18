<L>__{interior dressing room day}
<A>__{the dressing room is lined with dented lockers. wooden benches stretch across the room. on the wall is a sign that reads, "no kissing." rocky goes to his locker. he tries to open it but fails. he leans his ear against the lock and rolls the tumblers. still it does not open. he shakes the lock forcefully, no luck... rocky is flustered and sits on a bench to ponder the situation. after a moment of deep thought, rocky stands, seizes the bench and smashes open the lock. opening the door rocky is taken aback when he sees a set of very flashy clothes.}
