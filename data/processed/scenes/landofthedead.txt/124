<A>__{close on: kaufman staring out his penthouse window, aghast. licks of fire reflect on the glass. sounds of war can be heard from far below.}
<L>__{exterior "golden triangle night}
<A>__{in the pristine plaza that surrounds the building, walkers swarm. citizens run, screaming, including soldiers, driven from their posts, who shoot at the dead things. close on big daddy. who looks back and forth, as if torn, at the fiddler's green high rise, at the violence in the streets, back at the building, back at the streets. a soldier fires at him! misses. big daddy raises his rifle and blows him away.}
