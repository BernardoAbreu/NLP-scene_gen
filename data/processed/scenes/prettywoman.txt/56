<A>__{vivian comes out of the elevator and crosses the lobby. she is back in her hooker clothes. she leaves an envelope at the front desk. mr. thomas, the prim, middle aged hotel manager, steps out from his office. he stares in surprise and displeasure as he sees vivian exit out the front door. vivian doesn't notice the odd stares she gets from two well dressed middle aged women who are just entering.}
