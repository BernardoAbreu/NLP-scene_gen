<L>__{interior high school soon after}
<A>__{dale and angie walk hand in hand towards the locker.}
<C>__{angie}
<D>__{so, are you going to come over for dinner tomorrow, `cause my parents are beginning to think i made you up.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{well, yeah, i really want to meet them. tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow...let me think.}
<C>__{angie}
<D>__{you don't have to feel weird about it. they know how old you are and they're fine with it. they just want to meet you and see that you're a cool guy and that i'm not dating you just because you're older.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{of course. i know that. it's just...tomorrow's tight. i've got a whole bunch of cases that i can finish tomorrow. it's probably going to take me into the night.}
<C>__{angie}
<D>__{fuck. well, then you have to just come over sometime this week or something, okay? `cause it's getting weird for them.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{i will. i promise. i'm not trying to avoid this, for real, i've just been crazy busy.}
<C>__{teacher}
<D>__{hello? can i help you?}
<A>__{dale and angie turn to see a teacher, a guy about the same age as dale.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{pardon?}
<C>__{teacher}
<D>__{you can't just waltz in here and hit on the students. get out now before i }
<C>__{angie}
<D>__{mr. edwards, he's my boyfriend.}
<A>__{mr. edwards looks at dale, then shoots angie a confused look.}
<C>__{mr. edwards}
<D>__{this is your boyfriend? how old are you, 30?}
<C>__{dale}
<C>__{mr. edwards}
<D>__{and you're dating an 18 year old?}
<C>__{angie}
<D>__{i'm 19. i moved here from morocco.}
<A>__{dale doesn't know what to make of mr. edwards comments and looks.}
<C>__{mr. edwards}
<D>__{alright, well this school is for students and faculty only. friends can't just stop by.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{dude, you may be a teacher here, but we're about the same age, so don't get all high and mighty. it's not that weird. frankly, it's natural.}
<C>__{mr. edwards}
<D>__{well, in that case, get off school property or i'm calling the police liaison officer. angie, no offense to you, but if this guy's dating someone your age, it's because nobody his age will date him.}
<A>__{then, four handsome and fit students walk by.}
<C>__{handsome student}
<D>__{hey angie. you were hilarious in drama today.}
<A>__{angie smiles at the guys. dale doesn't like how all this is going down.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{i will wait in the car.}
