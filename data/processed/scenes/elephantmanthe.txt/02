<T>__{cut to black and silence:}
<B>__{circus}
<T>__{fade in to :}
<A>__{steam shooting out of a huge old half rusted calliope. the music is very loud and raucous. moving up and back we see the black awning entrance to the freak tent, where frederick treves, resident surgeon and lecturer on anatomy at the london hospital, is standing with his back to us observing the posters of the freaks. coming along a muddy walkway at the side of the tent is treves' wife, anne, and their two daughters. the shrill over whelming music seems to engulf her. she looks discomfited, vulnerable, and protective of her daughters. the girls, oblivious to any fear, are finishing their chocolate sweets. close up of treves looking at a poster. he hears:}
<D>__{#1 daughter poppa!}
<A>__{treves turns and looks down to a chocolate covered face. he smiles at the children and anne. anne sees the dirty faces and begins cleaning one of them. the other daughter looks into the freak tent.}
<D>__{#2 daughter poppa... may we go in there?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{alright... your turn.}
<A>__{she turns the girl away from the freak tent and begins cleaning her face. her kerchief pulls and distorts the little daughter's face. suddenly the girl sees a ring of elephants in the distance.}
<D>__{#2 daughter oh,look m ummy! elephants!}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{oh, elephants! we'll go see them.}
<A>__{she stands.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(to treves)}
<D>__{you won't be long?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{i will join you shortly.}
<A>__{she takes the children off toward the elephants. treves watches them go for a moment, then turns and we go with him into the dark freak tent. he pauses to pay admission at a small booth, then disappears within. darkness. we hear what could be the trumpeting of an elephant. treves parts the black canvas and enters the main part of the tent. off to his left he sees a man wrapped in a black cape, holding a conch shell aloft and blowing powerfully into it. the tent is dimly lit with flickering oil lamps. people mill about through the weaving corridors. to treves' right, he sees a sign reading, "the deadly fruit of the original sin," over a small, very dark corridor. treves enters the passage and disappears into the shadows. the corridor has a series of flaps and turns to disorient the spectator. treves carefully pushes his way through and arrives at the inner chamber. in a roped off space stands a small stage set at eve level, with curtains on three sides. on the stage is a bell jar filled with grey murky fluid lit from behind with casts an eerie glow in the chamber. suspended in the fluid is the life sized body of a baby doll with the attached head of a large snake. at the join of head and body is a blob of unidentifiable organic matter. it is obviously phony, but the effect is still very disquieting. at the bottom of the jar, in the muck, sits an apple with two large bites out of it. behind the jar is a painting on the order of a religious triptych, portraying adam on one side, eve on the other, and the tree flowering over the jar. treves' impassive face is bathed in the watery glow. he studies the strange object with a critical eye. in the passage we hear movement, and an older gentleman enters. he seems visibly impressed with "the deadly fruit of the original sin."}
<C>__{older man}
<D>__{a wicked birth...}
<A>__{after a moment, treves quietly leaves the inner chamber. as he pushes his way through the corridor, the noise grows and becomes a cacophony of strange sounds. he exits and hears a booming roar and the rush of air as a series of twelve candles, mounted in a row on a ten foot stand, are blown out by "the incredible wind man." his barker steps up and talks to the people.}
<C>__{barker}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, his lungs are larger than this mammoth blacksmith's bellows. so great is his power of exhalation, rivaling even that of the great north wind, that he will now challenge two grown men to attempt to hold the bellows shut as he applies the mighty blast of his herculean breath! are there any volunteers?}
<A>__{a few people raise their hands. the barker scans the crowd and then points over the heads of the volunteers to two men toward the back.}
<C>__{barker}
<D>__{ah! i see two likely lads! come forward! come forward! pit your strength against the mighty wind man!}
<A>__{during the above, the incredible wind man removes his cape, revealing his great barrel chest and pot belly supported by spindly, white, hairless legs. as the barker sets the "volunteers," the wind man walks about the small platform, huffing and puffing and blowing on the conch shell. the "volunteers" set, the wind man steps up to the end of the bellows, takes an enormous breath, and twirls his black handlebar moustache as a signal to the barker.}
<C>__{barker}
<D>__{gentlemen... are you ready?}
<C>__{the lads}
<D>__{yes we are... right... etc.}
<C>__{barker}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen!... let the demonstration begin!!}
<A>__{the wind man clamps his mouth to the bellows, and with great show begins to exhale, savagely stamping his feet. the two lads struggle obviously, and then pretend to be forced apart. the barker triumphantly lifts the wind man's hand. the wind man ceases to blow, removes his lips from the bellows and the two lads instantly collapse together on the floor.}
<C>__{barker}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen!... "the incredible wind man!!!}
<A>__{the crowd cheers, while the wind man puts the conch shell to his lips and proudly stamps his feet, circling about the two lads. amidst this applause, treves smiles indulgently. he moves on, looking for something genuine. two bobbies move through the crowd, intent upon a certain destination. treves conveys a casual interest in them. treves moves on to a bearded lady who combs her beard, busily chewing tobacco and spitting into a spittoon. treves continues to work his way through the crowd. up ahead he sees the bobbies.}
<C>__{bobbies}
<D>__{make way! make way!}
<A>__{they round a corner.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{oh yes they are, they're yours alright.}
<A>__{we hear the laughter of a crowd. treves moves closer to see a fat lady seated in a chair on the next platform. on each knee she holds a dwarf. they are dressed as babies. a skeleton man stands beside her.}
<C>__{skeleton man}
<D>__{i refuse to believe it! i will not accept it! those babies are simply too ugly, they cannot be mine!}
<A>__{the crowd laughs uproariously.}
<C>__{skeleton man}
<D>__{i don't want them! get rid of them! i don't want to see them!}
<C>__{fat lady}
<D>__{darling, don't be difficult! let's take our sweet lovely children on an outing.}
<C>__{skeleton man}
<D>__{we'll take these miserable whelps on an outing, alright! we'll take them to the zoo... where they will stay!}
<A>__{from the direction the bobbies have gone, we hear several screams.}
<C>__{fat lady}
<P>__{(pausing at the screams)}
<D>__{children save yourselves! prevail upon your pappa!}
<A>__{the two dwarves get down from her knees and approach the skeleton man. they kneel and tug at his thin legs.}
<C>__{dwarves}
<D>__{poppa! poppa! poppa, please!}
<A>__{at this point, a father holding his young son in his arms passes by treves. the young boy clutches his father's neck in fear, hiding his face.}
<C>__{father}
<P>__{(out loud, to no one in particular)}
<D>__{this is too much! they should not allow it! they should not allow it!}
<A>__{treves, very curious now, along with several others, make their way around the corner. before him, treves sees an agitated crowd staring at something that from his point of view he cannot see. brushing past him is a woman pulling a small, confused and frightened little girl. getting closer to the commotion, he sees four bobbies standing with a well dressed alderman, arguing with the owner of this particular exhibit. a distraught, almost hysterical woman is ineffectually striking the owner with her fists about his head and shoulders, crying weakly and incoherently.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{beast, beast...}
<A>__{treves is just about to see whatever it is that is causing the alarm, when one of the bobbies says:}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{no! that's right out! drop the curtain!}
<A>__{as the curtain drops, treves just glimpses baggy trouser cuffs and two horribly deformed, root like feet. the distraught woman has been pulled away from the owner and is sobbing on a bobby's shoulder.}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{you can't do that! i've got my rights!}
<C>__{alderman}
<D>__{i have the authority to close you down, and i'm doing just that!}
<A>__{in the crowd, treves notices a young boy staring open mouthed, blankly at the curtain. treves pushes through the glut of people to join the boy and get a better view. the curtain is actually a large canvas. on it is a life sized portrait, crudely painted, of a creature that could only be possible in a nightmare. it is the figure of a man turning into an elephant. the transformation, however, is not complete; there is still more of the man than beast. palm trees in the background suggest the jungle habitat in which this perverted object might have once roamed. filled with curiosity, treves moves toward the curtain.}
<C>__{alderman}
<D>__{this exhibit degrades all who see it, as well as the poor creature himself.}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{he's a freak! how else can he live?}
<C>__{alderman}
<D>__{freaks are one thing. no one objects to freaks, but this is entirely different. this is monstrous, and ought not to be allowed. these officers will see to it that you are on your way as soon as possible. good day.}
<A>__{the alderman turns and leaves the tent.}
<C>__{owner}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{...movin' again!}
<A>__{he shakes his head in disgust. now at the canvas, treves tries to lift the edge to get a peek inside the wagon, but the meaty hand of the owner clamps down on his wrist.}
<C>__{owner}
<D>__{have a care, guv'nor.}
<A>__{the two men look at each other for a solid moment.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{forgive me...}
<A>__{treves backs away and returns his gaze to the painted canvas.}
