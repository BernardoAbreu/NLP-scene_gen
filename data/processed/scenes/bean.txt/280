<L>__{interior parking lot day.}
<A>__{bean is inspecting the car. he's not too happy with it. '.he tries to get the bonnet down, but it insists on staying up. he shrugs his shoulders and gets in to drive off again, having to wind down the window and drive by leaning his head out. this means that as he heads for the exit, he fails to see the system to stop people leaving without paying, a foot high barrier that appears out of the ground. when he hits it, the car stops dead. bean gets out, leaving the car idling and goes to the booth where normally the attendant would be but everyone is in the gallery at the moment. inside he pushes a couple of buttons, and, hurrah, gets the one that drops the barrier. less hurrah, he has forgotten to put on the hand brake. as he moves back towards the car, it glides slowly down the ramp on the outside of the building, then accelerates, and finally, on a particularly sharp turn, smashes through the wall, and flies off the building. we hear a crash but do not see where it lands.}
