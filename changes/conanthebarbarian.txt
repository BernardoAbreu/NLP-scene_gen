<ACTION>__{Eyes closed, floating at peace within red glow of the womb. Suddenly, a flash of steel, as a sword pierces the womb, its tip not an inch from the baby's head. As the sword is ripped out, light streams in from outside, we travel with it, into the DIN of BATTLE.}

<ACTION>__{The Aesir HOWLS in agony, raising his sword to deliver the killing blow -- when another sword pierces his chest. The Aesir falls, revealing Corin standing behind him. Corin throws aside his horned helmet, and falls to his knees beside Islene, checking her wound. When he pulls his hands back they are coated in blood. Their eyes meet. Torment. Loss. They both know. She pulls a knife from the folds of her pelts, puts it in his hand.}

At the center of the pit URAN, an elder Cimmerian warrior speaks.}

Uran and Corin lead the main push of battle-frenzied barbarians as they swing their huge broadswords, extending their reach advantage over the Aquilonian's shorter weapons.
