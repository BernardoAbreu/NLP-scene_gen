<C>__{clay}
<D>__{how's the old man?}
<A>__{before clay can protest we hear: "hold on." clay glances out at couples strolling up the promenade. an operator interrupts, says: "one dollar for the next three minutes." clay deposits two quarters before his mother returns. "he's busy, clay."}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{the operator comes on again, asking for fifty more cents. clay stares at the quarters in his hand.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{time's up. i better go.}
<A>__{clay listens as his mother prattles on, until the connection is broken and the phone goes dead. clay steps out of the booth, takes a deep breath of ocean air.}
