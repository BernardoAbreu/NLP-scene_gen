<L>__{int back rooms stock area day (1947)}
<A>__{ a dark, tangled maze of rooms and corridors, boilers and furnaces, sump pumps, old washing machines, pallets of cleaning supplies and detergents, you name it. andy hefts a cardboard drum of hexlite off the stack, turns around and finds bogs diamond in the aisle. blocking his way. rooster looms from the shadows to his right, pete verness on the left. a frozen beat. andy slams the hexlite to the floor, rips off the top, and scoops out a double handful.}

<D>__{you get this in your eyes, it blinds you.}
<C>__{bogs}
<D>__{honey, hush.}
<A>__{andy backs up, holding them at bay, trying to maneuver through the maze. the sisters keep coming, tense and guarded, eyes riveted and gauging his every move, trying to outflank him. andy trips on some old gaint sugglies. that's all it takes. they're on him in an instant, kicking and stomping. andy gets yanked to his feet. bogs applies a chokehold from behind. they propel him across the room and slam him against an old four pocket machine, bending him over it. rooster jams a rag into andy's mouth and secures it with a steel pipe, like a horse bit. andy kicks and struggles, but rooster and pete have his arms firmly pinned. bogs whispers in andy's ear:}
<C>__{bogs}
<D>__{that's it, fight. better that way.}
<A>__{andy starts screaming, muffled by the rag. camera pulls back, slowly widening. the big washex blocks our view. all we see is andy's screaming face and the men holding him down... ...and camera drifts from the room, leaving the dark place and the dingy act behind...moving up empty corridors, past concrete walls and steel pipes...}

<D>__{i wish i could tell you that andy fought the good fight, and the sisters let him be. i wish i could tell you that, but prison is no fairy tale world.}
<A>__{we emerge into the prison laundry past a guard, widening for a final view of the line. the giant steel "mangler" is slapping down in brutal rhythm. the sound is deafening.}
