<L>__{interior pham van's store day}
<A>__{everyone stares in shock.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum...}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{gotta do something. gotta get the bastards!}
<C>__{miguel}
<P>__{(hopeless)}
<D>__{man, what the hell can we do to those things?}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{well, we're sure as hell not going to sit here being quiet for god knows how long. are we?}
<C>__{pham van}
<D>__{now wait a minute, earl. i got enough food here to last us for weeks. those damn things can't wait around forever.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{we can do it. i mean, if we have to, right?}
<A>__{everyone turns away from the windows, gingerly sitting down, glumly pondering this possibility. there is a long silence. then suddenly roar! the silence is shattered as pham van's big freezer compressor suddenly comes on.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{jesus! shut it off!}
<A>__{pham runs to the freezer. its on off switch is buried behind stacks of soft drink cases. he tears at them like a madman, toppling them this way and that. earl and val join him. but right behind pham, the floor buckles up, a monster's snout bursting through and engulfing one of his legs! the creature starts to back down into the jagged hole, dragging screaming pham with it. val, earl, rhonda, and miguel grab pham's arms but are no match for the monster. it shakes and spins him like some gigantic dog, effortlessly throwing them off, relentlessly pulling pham down. the hole in the floor is too small for pham to fit through ! as one leg goes down, the other is bent hideously backward. pham screams and screams as jagged wood tears into him, bones snap, ribs crack. the others grab him again but are utterly helpless. with vicious, powerful jerks the creature yanks his man mangled body down. the last thing we see is his foot, now folded back past his head, and he's gone. val is wild with helpless anger.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{son of a bitch! son of a bitch!}
<A>__{the floor bulges up in another place! a second creature! then a third, coming right up under them! earl sprawls onto the bar. rhonda springs onto the shelves in the middle of the store, knocking groceries everywhere. val and miguel climb up shelves which cover the rear wall of the store. the whole building shakes and shudders, dust powdering down from the ceiling. flailing tentacles are everywhere, slashing open food packages; clouds of flour fill the air! val spots a hatch in the ceiling.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{everybody! this way! the roof!}
<A>__{earl leaps from the bar to the rear shelves. val and miguel slide sideways till they're beneath the hatch, then use the shelves as a ladder, climbing up to the hatch. val pounds on it frantically. in the middle of the store, rhonda leaps from shelf to shelf, trying to get closer to where val is. soon she reaches the last one, balancing precariously. but a creature tips over the first one! the shelves topple like dominoes, crashing toward rhonda. she is half catapulted, half jumps right through an open window, ripping through the screen. val sees what's happened. with maniacal strength he smashes open the hatch and climbs out onto }
