<A>__{malee, leonard and jacob sit, playing life, the board game.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{don't worry, white male infants are the hardest to come by. 60 minutes did a whole story on it.}
<C>__{malee}
<D>__{since when do you watch 60 minutes?}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{since i was in the hospital. they said, any adoption agency worth its salt has at least a three year waiting list. by the time your parents get a kid, you'll be in college. you think they'll want to start over again with that baby shit?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no, but it's like they're trying to replace rudy.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{it doesn't matter cause it's not gonna happen.}
<A>__{malee has been silent this entire time. seeing a moment, she speaks up.}
<C>__{malee}

<C>__{malee}
<D>__{i will go with you.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{why are you all of a sudden going to get the drinks?}
<C>__{malee}
<P>__{(bitchy)}
<D>__{because you've upset me, and i don't want to see you right now.}
<A>__{leonard looks to jacob.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{fine, i will get the drinks.}
<A>__{leonard exits. malee turns to jacob.}
<C>__{malee}
<D>__{i need a favor. it's big. i need you to hide something for me.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{hide what?}
<A>__{malee reaches into her back pack.}
<C>__{malee}
<D>__{promise, you won't freak.}

<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{where'd you get it?}
<C>__{malee}
<D>__{i can't tell you. i just need you to hide it for a while. when all is cool, i will come for it.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{why can't you keep it?}
<C>__{malee}
<D>__{my mother is a total snoop. she goes through my stuff like all the time.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{please, jacob. somebody's life might depend on it.}

<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{is it loaded?}
<C>__{malee}
<D>__{no, but i do have some bullets.}
<A>__{malee reaches into her backpack and removes the bullets. jacob takes them out and puts them in the lock box.}
<C>__{malee }
<D>__{sure your parents won't find it?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{nobody has the combination, but me. besides, i could be building a bomb in here, and they wouldn't even know.}
<A>__{off jacob, locking the box up.}
