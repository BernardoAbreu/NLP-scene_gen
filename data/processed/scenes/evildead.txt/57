<D>__{hey, tomorrow morning, we'll find some way around that cliff into town okay?}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{outside the window, scott chops more wood for the nights fire. ashly turns on the tape recorder to listen with the ear plug.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{march 12th. suzanne came after me and almost murdered me. my own wife. at first i thought it was a mental or physical disorder because of what had happened to her eyes, but i was only fooling myself. i knew what it was.}
<A>__{outside the window, scott continues to chop and gather wood. shelly, still engaged in cards with linda, holds up one in particular.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{okay, guess this card.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{how am i going to know what card that is?}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{guess, i'm going to see if you're psychic.}
<A>__{the card is a two of clubs.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{okaaaay...is it a queen?}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{right!}
<C>__{linda}

<C>__{linda}
<D>__{hey ash, i guessed the card right.}
<C>__{ashly}
<P>__{(indifferently) truly amazing linda.}
<A>__{he is listening intently to the log as it continues.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{three days have passed since that thing has been down there. i was hop ing to weaken it without food or water. nothing worked. finally, in desperation i dragged her out to the shed and dismembered her so that what ever it was could not get up again.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{cheryl, did you see that?}
<A>__{cheryl remains with her back to them staring out the window.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{try this one.}
<A>__{she removes a nine of clubs from the deck and holds it up.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{okay, lemme think, uh...}
<A>__{she puts her hands to her head in a curved funnel form ation as if to direct her thoughts to the card.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{...um, it's a seven.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{oh my god, what suit?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{diamonds, no wait! i mean hearts!}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{that's right seven of hearts!}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{hey ash, did you see that? i guessed two cards in a row.}
<C>__{ashly}
<P>__{(still not paying attention) how do}
<D>__{you do it linda?}
<A>__{he is concentrating on the tape.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{this is when i saw the dark figures moving about in the woods. i should have never tampered with the "book of the dead." i now know that what ever it is i have resurrected through this book, is coming for me.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{you know, i always thought i had some sort of extra sense. you know, like e.s.p or something.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{what's this one?}
<A>__{she holds up the queen of spades.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{another seven!}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{i don't believe it!}
<C>__{cheryl}
<P>__{(still looking outside) queen of}
<D>__{spades.}
<A>__{shelly looks at her card then back to cheryl. she holds up another card.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{four of hearts.}
<A>__{the card is a four of hearts. shelly bites her lip in fear and reaches for another card. ashly and linda listen in silence.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{eight of spades.}
<A>__{shelly picks up the card. cheryl is correct again.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{two of spades jack of diamonds jack of clubs }
<A>__{faster and faster she calls them off. even before shelly can flip them to keep up. suddenly, cheryl turns toward the group. her eyes are bone white. shelly's deck of cards slip from her hand and scatter across the floor. cheryl's body is hoisted up to its feet and jerked about like a white eyed marionette. she speaks in a voice un like her own.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{why have you disturbed our sleep, awakened us from our ancient slum ber? you will die. like the others before you. we will take you one by one. all of you ha ha ha ha ha }
<A>__{she screams in a low gruff voice and collapses to the floor.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{oh my god, shelly, get scott in here!}
<A>__{shelly does not respond.}
<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{hurry!}
<A>__{she exits through the front door. linda moves to cheryl and lifts her head gently. cheryl appears unconcious but behind her, she reaches for a pen.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{did you see her eyes? i'm scared. what's wrong with her?}
<A>__{ashly begins to speak when scott and shelly enter.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{what happened to her?}
<A>__{cheryl's hand clutches the pen tightly.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{look at her eyes.}
<A>__{scott's hand reaches for cheryl's eyes to inspect them, but they blink open. the pen in her hand races upward, then slashes down, ripping into linda's achilles tendon. linda screams fiercely and with a blur, the bloodied pen is raised again. ashly grabs cheryl's arm stopping her, but with a powerful swipe, she swings her remaining arm at linda who is sent sprawling across the cabin floor. cheryl then clutches ashly and, almost lifting him, sends his body reeling across the room into a book case which topples over, trapping him beneath its weight. shelly stands screaming as cheryl now advances toward ashly's face with the bloody pen. he struggles to pull himself out but cannot. cheryl is almost upon him when scott grabs her from behind. effortlessly, she tosses him off and moves toward ashly again. scott climbs to his feet and grabs the axe. cheryl raises the pen above ashly's face, and scott gives her a sharp jab in the jaw with the wooden handle. cheryl stumbles past linda and falls backwards, head first into the cellar. she begins to climb out but scott slams the trap door shut upon her hand. it won't close. cheryl starts to push the trap door open from below. scott climbs on top and is almost thrown off until he viciuosly rams the butt of his axe down upon her protruding hand. demented screams and moans are heard from below as cheryl's hand is finally pulled back and scott manages to secure the chain across the hatch.}
