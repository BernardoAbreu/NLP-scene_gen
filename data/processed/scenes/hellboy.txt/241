<A>__{hellboy slowly comes to. he is chained to a massive wooden yoke. he takes notice of his surroundings: a large church like space, surrounded by funeral niches and statues holding swords. high columns flank huge mechanical gears. an solar system model takes the place of an altar. off to one side, ilsa uses a hammer to destroy the timers on the explosive belts. next to the main nave, myers is tied to a stone pillar. under his feet, a blood channel, leading to the immense stone slab bought from lapikov. liz lies at grigory's feet. he's dressed in a ceremonial robe and holds his leather book open. his back to hellboy, he faces a mural of the angel abbadon holding a key.}

<D>__{"and i looked and beheld an angel, and in his hand the key to the bottomless pit..."}
<A>__{hellboy tenses, rage building. the yoke creaks, but doesn't bend.}

<D>__{these were the words i heard as a peasant boy in tobolsk. and now, the door sent by the ogdruh jahad so that they might at long last enter our world.}

<A>__{ilsa kicks myers in the face.}
<C>__{ilsa}
<D>__{silence!!}
<A>__{the open dome above reveals the moon. an eclipse is beginning. the altar's clockworks monitors its progress.}
<C>__{ilsa}
<D>__{imagine it: an eden for you and her }
<C>__{hellboy}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{grigory turns to hellboy.}
<C>__{grigory}
<D>__{no?}

<D>__{in exchange for her life then, open the door.}
<A>__{in torment, hellboy, shakes his head: no.}
<C>__{grigory}
<D>__{as you wish.}
<A>__{he leans over liz, whispers in her ear: her body arches, her mouth emits a plume of energy. grigory greedily inhales it. then she goes limp.}
<C>__{grigory}
<D>__{she's dead.}
<C>__{hellboy}
<D>__{noooo! noooo!!!}
<A>__{he struggles again. one of the cuffs snaps. he swats ilsa with his free hand. she stumbles backwards. now hellboy fights to free his other hand. indifferent, grigory watches the eclipse.}
<C>__{grigory}
<D>__{her soul awaits on the other side. if you want her back...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{open the door and claim her.}
<A>__{his head and heart racing, hellboy struggles for an answer. can't find one... the moon is almost totally eclipsed. he drops his gaze. his voice a hoarse whisper.}
<C>__{hellboy}
<D>__{for her.}
<A>__{grigory moves close to hellboy. rips the rosary off his wrist. it lands near myers.}
