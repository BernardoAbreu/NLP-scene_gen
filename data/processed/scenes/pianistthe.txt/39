<L>__{exterior streets day}
<A>__{szpilman running. streets crowded. corpses. szpilman, sweating, dodges and sidesteps. then, suddenly, a woman bars his way. she's the feather woman, brightly rouged, with her thickly painted eyebrows, the unsteady mauve ostrich feather rising from her straw hat.}
<C>__{the feather woman}
<D>__{excuse me, but have you seen my husband izaak szerman?}
<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{i'm afraid not.}
<A>__{he tries to dodge past but she grabs his arm.}
<C>__{the feather woman}
<D>__{he's tall, he's handsome. he has a little grey beard. if you see him, please do write, izaak szerman's his name, don't forget.}
<A>__{szpilman manages to free himself and runs on.}
