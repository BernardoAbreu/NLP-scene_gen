<D>__{that's a mess down there, jim. we've bitten off more "vietnam" that we can possibly chew.}
<A>__{jim, now 46, reads the front page of the washington post which details the latest battle in vietnam. he sits next to senator long from louisiana, in his 50's, who's drinking a whiskey. they're on a crowded businessman's shuttle. we see a close up of a newspaper article about the vietnam war: "more troops asked by westmoreland."}
<C>__{long}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore. i saw a girl the other day, she was pregnant you could see her whole belly, and you know what she painted on it? "love child." it's fuckin' outa control. values've gone to hell, jim... course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat johnson in the white house.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i sometimes feel things've gone downhill since john kennedy was killed, senator.}
<C>__{long}
<D>__{don't get me started on that. those warren commission fellows were pickin' gnat shit out of pepper. no one's gonna tell me that kid did the shooting job he did from that damned bookstore.}
<C>__{stewardess}
<D>__{here you go, senator long.}
<A>__{the stewardess brings more drinks.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{i thought the fbi test fired the rifle to make sure it could be done?}
<C>__{long}
<D>__{sure, three experts and not one of them could do it! they're telling us oswald got off three shots with world class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds and accordin' to his marine buddies he got maggie's drawers he wasn't any good. average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and i tell ya the first shot would always be the best. here, the third shot's perfect. don't make sense. and then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits kennedy and connally seven times. one "pristine" bullet? that dog don't hunt.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and i can't put my finger on it.}
<C>__{long}
<D>__{if i were investigatin', i'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in dallas that day. you been duck hunting? i think oswald was a good old fashioned decoy. what'd he say? "i'm just a patsy." out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you think there were other men involved, russell?}
<A>__{russell looks at jim quizzically and laughs.}
<C>__{long}
<D>__{hell, you're the district attorney. you read the warren report and then you tell me you're satisfied lee oswald shot the president all by his lonesome.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire. i just can't believe the chief justice of the united states would put his name on something that wasn't true.}
<C>__{long}
<P>__{(to the stewardess)}
<D>__{honey, another one of these. this one's as weak as cricket pee pee. yessir, you mark my words, jim, vietnam's gonna cost johnson '68 and it's gonna put that other varmint nixon in then watch your hide, 'cause there ain't no offramps on a freeway to hell!}
<A>__{garrison's study night(1966) the study is lined with bookshelves up to the ceiling; we see photos of family, a chess set. jim, smoking his pipe, reads in a red leather chair from one of the 26 thick warren commission volumes piled all over the place. liz enters. jasper, now 7, draws on a piece of paper on the floor at jim's feet.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{jim, dinner's just about ready... i've got a surprise for you... tried something new... jim? jim, dinner.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(lost in thought)}
<D>__{mmmmm... sure smells good... but egghead, do you realize oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it? i can't believe it. a police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that oswald said would be inadmissible in court.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{come on now, we'll talk about it at the table, dinner's getting cold.}
<P>__{(to jasper)}
<D>__{what are you doing in here?}
<C>__{jasper}
<D>__{daddy said it was all right if i was real quiet.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(rising to dinner)}
<D>__{sure it is. freckle face, if i ever handled a minor felon like that, it'd be all over the papers. i'd catch hell. and this is the alleged murderer of the president?}
<A>__{garrison dining room (1966) two year old elizabeth watches "crusader rabbit" on tv as the new one year old sits in diapers with liz at one end of the dinner table. jim sits at the other end. there are five kids now, ages 7, 5, 4, 2 and 1... and mattie, the housekeeper. dinner's finished, they pass plates, the children horse around... the boxer dog, touchdown, begs for a piece of the action. jim, not a big eater, feeds him ice cream.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{again and again they ignore credible testimony, leads are never followed up, its conclusions are selective, there's no index, it's one of the sloppiest, most disorganized investigations i've ever seen. dozens and dozens of witnesses in dealey plaza that day are saying they heard shots coming from the grassy knoll area in front of kennedy and not the book depository behind him, but it's all broken down and spread around and you read it and the point gets lost.}
<C>__{mattie}
<D>__{i never did believe it either!}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(politely listening)}
<D>__{uh huh... mattie, i will do the dishes, you take be up now. and elizabeth, too, your bedtime, honey.}
<C>__{elizabeth jr.}
<D>__{nahhhh! i don't wanna go to bed!}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{honey, that was three years ago we all tried so hard to put that out of our minds, why are you digging it up again? you're the d.a. of new orleans. isn't the kennedy assassination a bit outside your domain? i mean all those important people already studied it.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i can't believe a man as intelligent as earl warren ever read what's in those volumes.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{well maybe you're right, jim. i will give you one hour to solve the case... until the kids are in bed.}
<P>__{(rising, she puts her}

<P>__{his ear)}
<D>__{then you're mine and mr. kennedy can wait 'til morning. come on, everybody say goodnight to daddy.}

<D>__{a rhinoceros. can i stay up another hour?}

<D>__{pickle and snapper, my two favorite dancing partners.}
<A>__{as the children dance, they fall off jim's feet, laughing and giggling. he throws each in the air and kisses them.}
