<A>__{a cabinet meeting in the rainbow nation, with mandela at the head of the table. the minister of the environment is making a presentation about a campaign to put an end to littering by plastic bags. behind him is a very dramatic slide image of a rural barbed wire fence festooned with wind blown plastic bags.}
<C>__{minister of the environment}
<D>__{ and in addition to the nationwide pr campaign, we propose that all retail outlets charge a nominal fee for plastic bags }
<A>__{mary enters quietly, slips a piece of paper in front of mandela, who reads it, holds up his hand.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{mr. minister, please forgive me. this sounds excellent, and we will return to it, but if you'll indulge me for just one minute }
<A>__{mandela nods to mary, who switches on a big tv on the wall which shows news footage of the coaching clinic in the township. when we see the footage of the lock scrumming with the kids, mandela laughs, delighted, turns to his cabinet.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{you see, that picture is worth any number of speeches.}
