<C>__{sydney prosser }
<D>__{i created edith because i needed her to survive, okay? but i'm done with that now. i'm so fucking done with that. like you do what you need to survive, right? you do it. you know, you live with your mom you have a fiancee you don't even acknowledge, right? that's what you do. and you curl your hair in little fucking curlers, which is no, it's okay, you look good with it, but you know you have straight hair, so that's what you do to survive. you do all sorts of things, you know. we all do.}

<A>__{red faced like he may hit her, a vein stands out in his neck. she flinches. he screams like an animal in confusion and frustration.}
<C>__{richie dimaso}
<D>__{ahhh!}
<A>__{suddenly sydney grabs a glass picture frame from a table, smashes it across richie's forehead and face with a}
<B>__{shattering of glass.}
<A>__{richie in pain holds his cut forehead and eyebrow.}

<D>__{what richie's gotten us into is worse then jail. i told you last night, don't sit down with those goons. and what? now what? no one's getting ten million for tellegio. it's over.}
<C>__{richie dimaso}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<A>__{irving and sydney stare.}
<C>__{richie dimaso }
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{because when tellegio finds out what happened, do you think he's gonna go after me? i don't think so. someone from the bureau?}
<C>__{richie dimaso }
<D>__{think he's gonna go after a politician? he's gonna kill you. then he's going to go after your son. and sydney.}
