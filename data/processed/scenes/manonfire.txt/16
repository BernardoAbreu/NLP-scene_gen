<C>__{samuel}
<D>__{i have a policy, aig. it covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, i will not be able to renew it.}

<D>__{you need a bodyguard of some description. it's a dangerous world we live in. but you will get what you pay for. he doesn't need to be superman, does he? can you go fifteen grand?}
<C>__{samuel}
<D>__{for a year?}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{for a few months. hire someone cheap. you have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance. then fire him for incompetence. the important thing is lisa's daughter will return to school.}

<C>__{samuel}
<D>__{and lisa will be able to save face. we won't be the only family without a bodyguard.}
