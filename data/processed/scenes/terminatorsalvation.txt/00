<T>__{fade in on:}
<L>__{interior death row cell dawn}
<A>__{start tight on marcus wright. he's an intense, powerful man,}
<L>__{20's 30's, his head shaven. marcus stares into camera with a}
<A>__{resigned expression. we hear the voice of a priest:}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{yea, though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death, i will fear no evil: for thou art beside me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me...}
<A>__{camera pulls back, straight up. marcus lies in his cot, staring at the ceiling. he's smoking a cigarette. this overhead angle reveals a priest with a bible, in a folding chair beside him. a chess set, stacks of books, writing materials in the cell. two guards wait, shackles in hand. marcus has no interest in scripture. he blows a cloud of smoke which drifts in the direction of the priest, who blinks and shuts his bible. one of the guards unlocks the cell door for dr. serena kogan. she's in her 30's 50's, brilliant, attractive, but thin and pale, a scarf tied around her head. she carries a clipboard. the priest backs off to give her some privacy with marcus.}
<C>__{serena}
<D>__{marcus i'm doctor serena kogan, i'm with project angel. you consented to donate your body to science...}
<C>__{marcus}

<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{chosen? lucky me.}
<C>__{serena}
<D>__{we just need a couple of signatures...}
<A>__{marcus sits up, she passes him the clipboard and pen he notes that her hands are shaking.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{you don't need to be scared.}
<C>__{serena}
<D>__{i'm not. it's nerve degeneration.}
<A>__{marcus looks up from the form, takes in the scarf covering her sparse hair.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{cancer?}
<C>__{serena}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{you're not the only one with a death sentence.}
<A>__{marcus meets her eyes. she studies him a beat.}
<C>__{serena }
<D>__{what you're doing is important, marcus. our work is still highly experimental... but you may be helping people in ways you can't begin to imagine.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{i'm a regular hero.}
<A>__{with that sarcastic comment, he signs his name we see the words "project angel" at the top of dense type on the form. serena takes the clipboard, starts to rise. she touches his hand for a moment.}
<C>__{serena}
<D>__{thank you. and... i'm sorry.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{no one lives forever.}
