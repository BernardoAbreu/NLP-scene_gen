<L>__{interior hector's room night}
<A>__{late at night, hector is still awake. he rises from his bed and quietly moves out of the room. he is careful not to disturb the sleeping forms lying all around him, some of them sprawled on the floor. he shares his bed room with at least eight other slaves. privacy is a master's privilege.}
<L>__{interior house night}
<A>__{in the darkened house, hector makes his way up some stairs and along a passage. the only sound is a crack or two of far away thunder. at the end of the passage, hector finds a small ladder propped against the wall. he climbs this, and lifts open the trap door above his head.}
