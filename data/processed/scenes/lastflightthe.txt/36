<D>__{chiki chiki!}
<A>__{during this, francis has casually inspected a curtained walk in closet near the table. he pulls the curtain to reveal a rack of carefully hung dresses and a floor covered with dozens of shoes organized in impeccably straight lines.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{say, i never saw so many shoes.}
<A>__{the others gather to peer into the closet. frink loses interest immediately but whistles at the sight of nikki's sheer nightgown draped across her bed. he moves to it eagerly. nikki sits on the edge of the bed removing her shoes as frink picks up her silk bedclothes and examines them with a grin. bill pointedly takes the gown out of frink's hand. tight lipped, frink stares at him. suddenly, bill points to a small wind up clock on nikki's night table.}

<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{help yourself.}

<P>__{(satisfied)}
<D>__{ah!}
<A>__{shep, watching this, scratches his head, confused, then moves to join him. frink watches francis drag some sort of heavy fringed rug to the floor near the sofa, apparently preparing to lie down on it.}

<D>__{good night, nikki.}
<A>__{cary, perhaps pleased with nikki's attention to him, watches her withdraw into the bedroom and shut the door. he turns from the door to see: low angle shot sitting room four men, happily situated, settling in for a night's sleep: bill and shep on the sofa, frink on a chair, their three pairs of feet propped up on a table. francis, his head on a pillow, lies on the floor, stretching his legs and yawning as only a narcoleptic can.}

<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i got it, i got it, i got it.}
<A>__{from over nikki's nearly bare back, we watch bill whistling jauntily as he shakes eau de cologne onto a towel.}

<B>__{bill and nikki}

<D>__{my, my!}
<A>__{he scrubs her neck.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i could go on doin' this a long time.}
<A>__{more scrubbing and then an amusing pantomime: to nikki's bewilderment, bill pulls back the hair over her ear, looks down into her ear, cleans it out with his little finger, flicks wax off his finger daintily, buffs the ear with the towel, and finally blows sharply into the ear, causing her to wince. she places her head on his shoulder again. more scrubbing. tracking shot sitting room we start on cary, who sits rocking in a tilted chair and smoking, watching bill and nikki with amusement. after a pause:}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{nikki? are you rich?}

<D>__{come on, fellas!}
<A>__{he rushes off. shep, francis and frink rise and follow. cary merely collects his hat and cane and heads for the front door. sitting room another view bill and shep carry the sofa over and place it directly in front of nikki's closed bedroom door. francis brings his rug and pillow.}
