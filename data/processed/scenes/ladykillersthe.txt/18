<T>__{cut up to:}
<A>__{the director. he scowls down at the animal.}
<C>__{director}
<D>__{...props!}
<A>__{a man in a hemingway field jacket with multiple pockets, and also a loaded utility belt, trots up toward him, his belt jangling as he runs. this is clark pancake. pancake is a florid beer bellied man in his late fifties. he has a full blond grey grizzly adams beard and wears multi pocketed shorts that form an ensemble with his hemingway jacket. the director is angry.}
<C>__{director}
<D>__{...the goddamn thing's canteen fell off. it would have been a good take.}
<A>__{pancake is unperturbed.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{okay. okay. we're prepared for that...}
<A>__{he hits a button on the radio on his belt and talks into his headset:}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{... mountain, bring otto with the apparatus.}
<B>__{pulling another bulldog}
<A>__{he strains at his lead, muscling forward as quickly as his minder and his own stumpy little legs will allow. he peers through the two goggly eyeholes of an antique leather gas mask, its pignose breathing apparatus covering his own snout. his phlegmy breathing is amplified by the device. we tilt up the lead to show his minder, mountain girl. she is a solid woman in her late forties with freckles beginning to merge into age spots. her long straw colored hair is tightly braided into heidi pigtails bound with red ribbon. otherwise her dress is unadorned. the director squints at the dog.}
<C>__{director}
<D>__{what the hell is this?}
<A>__{pancake's manner is professorial:}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{world war i vintage gas mask. it's authentic. strapped on, of course, so it can't fall off. the animal is free to be as active as he wants, doesn't inhibit his movement, and i think it really sells the whole doughboy thing }
<C>__{director}
<D>__{it looks like a fucking joke.}
<A>__{pancake stares at the director for a moment and, though not doing anything, makes a sound of concentrated effort:}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{...nnnnrnff!}
<A>__{the director squints at him:}
<C>__{director}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{pancake comes out of his trance, or whatever it was:}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{no, nothing, uh... you're absolutely right, the gas mask is a whimsical concept }
<C>__{director}
<D>__{how the hell does it eat when it gets to the kennel rations?}
<A>__{the dog looks up from person to person as each speaks, twisting its neck to peer through the eyeholes. its breathing is growing louder.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{well, you're absolutely right }
<C>__{director}
<D>__{don't let the client see this.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{of course not, that would be inappropriate }
<C>__{director}
<D>__{or the humane fucker.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{no no }
<A>__{the dog gets down on its knees, slowly, like a camel, breathing ever more loudly.}
<C>__{director}
<D>__{they'll shut the fucking spot down, pancake. put the goddamn canteen back on. that says he's a soldier. dented tin canteen. just tie the damn thing to his collar.}
<A>__{the dog flops over into the mud.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{easiest thing in the world. i just thought but the canteen is much better. good concept. let's go with that }
<C>__{director}
<D>__{what's he doing?}
<A>__{the dog has started to convulse.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{well, he's uh... just breathe normally, otto.}
<C>__{director}
<D>__{the fucking dog can't breathe.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{oh, he can breathe, that thing is just breathe normally, otto.}
<A>__{the dog's breath is rasping and horrible.}
<C>__{director}
<D>__{the fucking dog cannot breathe! get that fucking thing off him!}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{of course. easiest thing in the world.}
<A>__{he stoops and fiddles at the straps.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{...it's on good and tight, i, uh... just breathe normally, otto.}
<A>__{he starts thumping at his pockets.}
<C>__{director}
<D>__{get the fucking thing off him!}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{don't have my leatherman. mountain! give me your leatherman! chop chop!}
<C>__{director}
<D>__{get the fucking thing off him! chitra, make sure the humane fucker doesn't come over here! bring him to craft services!}
<A>__{as he makes to scoop up the dog:}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{good idea! ice water, treats }
<C>__{director}
<D>__{not the dog, you idiot! the humane fucker! distract him!}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{right! of course!}
<A>__{he goes back to work on the mask.}
<C>__{director}
<D>__{oh my god, he's bleeding!}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{no, that's me i the leatherman... here we go.}
<A>__{his hand gouting blood, he finally manages to get the gas mask off. a crowd is starting to gather and gape. the director barks at a grip:}
<C>__{director}
<D>__{put up a couple solids here i don't want the client seeing this!}
<A>__{pancake thumps on the inert dog's chest.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{come on, otto!}
<C>__{director}
<D>__{otto is fucking dead!}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{mountain, have electric run me a stinger! don't give up on me, otto! mountain, i need two live leads!}
<A>__{more people crowd in to look.}
<C>__{mountain girl}
<D>__{clark, the gennie's a hundred yards away!}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{goddamnit! otto's gonna have brain damage in about ninety seconds! okay!}
<A>__{he pulls the dog's lips back, exposing its teeth and slobbered tongue.}
<C>__{pancake}
<D>__{...kiss of life!}
<A>__{he sucks in a deep breath and starts mouth to mouthing the beast.}
