<C>__{christof }
<D>__{we knew we were taking a risk. she hadn't been properly coached, but we were torn... he'd summoned the courage to make the approach...we wanted to reward that. of course she took full advantage...}
<A>__{truman and lauren run up to the ledge of the pool surrounding the steel sculpture.}
<C>__{lauren}
<D>__{i never knew this place existed.}
<A>__{they both stare down at the inviting water. lauren suddenly throws off her cardigan and jumps into the pool without another thought. she comes splashing to the surface. truman stares down, transfixed hy the shimmering water.}
<C>__{lauren}
<D>__{come on! come on! it's wonderful!}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(nervous)}
<D>__{i...i can't.}
<A>__{lauren suddenly stops splashing.}
<C>__{lauren}
<D>__{that's right. oh, god, i'm sorry.}
<A>__{she quickly climbs out of the pool, dripping wet.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{why? you've got nothing to be sorry about. has someone been talking to you?}
<A>__{lauren wrings out her dress.}
<C>__{lauren}
<P>__{(to the sky, upset)}
<D>__{get me out of here. i don't want to be here.}
<A>__{lauren starts walking away.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(confused, calling after her)}
<D>__{what are you talking about? lauren! lauren!}
<A>__{truman runs after lauren and holds her by the arms, forcing her to face him.}
<C>__{lauren}
<P>__{(distraught)}
<D>__{my name's not lauren! it's sylvia!}
<A>__{truman looks into her eyes and believes her. the picture fast forwards again at high speed for a moment and}
<B>__{returns to normal.}
<A>__{truman and sylvia (as she is now called throughout the remainder of the movie) sit on the ledge of the pool the same spot as truman and the hooker, veronica, seventeen years later. as we have just seen imitated, sylvia and truman kiss with great delicacy. truman goes to say something but she covers his lips with her finger.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{in a minute someone's going to come and stop me talking to you.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(looking around the deserted park)}
<D>__{who? there's no one around.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<P>__{(covering his lips once again)}
<D>__{you remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like magellan. and your teacher, sister olivia said, "you're too late, truman. there's nothing left to explore." and all the other kids laughed. and you sat down.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{how do you know about that?}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{it doesn't matter. you've forgotten about that boy, truman. you got scared. just because something happens, doesn't mean you can't take another chance in your life.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<P>__{(looking over her shoulder nervously)}
<D>__{there isn't much time. just listen. everybody's pretending truman. everybody but you.}
<P>__{(pointing to the buildings on the horizon)}
<D>__{look at that project. you think anybody lives there? it's all for you, truman. a show. the eyes are everywhere.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(protesting)}
<D>__{eyes? where?}
<C>__{sylvia}
<P>__{(frustrated, raving)}
<D>__{everywhere, disguised... truman, they're going to fill your head with lies. you've got to make yourself deaf, you understand? when you're afraid the most, it means you're on the right track. trust that boy. promise me you'll do that?}
<A>__{truman nods, unsure of the commitment he is making. suddenly a 1962 plymouth roars towards the fountain out of nowhere.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<P>__{(scared)}
<D>__{i told you, truman!}
<A>__{the car skids to a stop and a large man, 40ish, with a shock of dark hair jumps from the car. the man yanks the frightened sylvia to her feet causing her cardigan to fall to the ground.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{hey!}
<C>__{man}
<P>__{(to sylvia)}
<D>__{get in the car, lauren!}
<A>__{truman jumps up.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(to the man)}
<D>__{who are you?!}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{i'm her father!}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{no he's not! he's just saying that! does he look anything like me?!}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{shut your mouth!}
<A>__{the man backhands sylvia roughly across the face and bundles her into his car. truman rushes at the man.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{leave her alone!}
<A>__{the man easily fends truman off, knocking him to the ground. he slams shut the passenger door of the plymouth.}
<C>__{man}
<P>__{(to sylvia)}
<D>__{i told you not to come here anymore!}
<P>__{(to truman, who is getting to his feet)}
<D>__{which one are you?}
<A>__{truman is suddenly struck dumb, the doubts start crowding back into his head.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<P>__{(calling out from the car)}
<D>__{don't listen to him, truman. make yourself deaf. come find me.}
<C>__{man}
<P>__{(to truman, getting into the car)}
<D>__{don't bother! we're moving to australia. new york's done something to her head.}
<A>__{the plymouth roars away. truman stares after it and then turns back to the cardigan left on the ground.}
<C>__{christof }
<D>__{why did he say australia? why couldn't he have said new jersey?}
