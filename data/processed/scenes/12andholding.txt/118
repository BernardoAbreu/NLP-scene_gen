<D>__{malee?}
<P>__{(noticing something)}
<D>__{oh my god!}
<A>__{reveal malee, standing across the room. she is no longer the gawky, adolescent girl. rather, she has been transformed into a beautiful young woman. her glasses have been replaced by contacts, and her braided pig tails by a quaff of chin length curls.}
<C>__{yacco }
<D>__{what did you do?}
<C>__{malee}
<D>__{i got a new look. you know, for spring. what do you think?}
<A>__{malee spins around, giving yacco the full picture.}
<C>__{yacco}
<D>__{you look...}
<C>__{malee}
<D>__{beautiful?}
<C>__{yacco}
<D>__{different. what happened to your glasses?}
<C>__{malee}
<D>__{contacts. it took me like forty five minutes to get them in, but beauty is pain.}
<C>__{yacco}
<D>__{honey, in the future, i'd like to know if you're going to radically change your appearance. clean your stuff up and come down for dinner.}
<A>__{yacco exits. malee looks in the mirror, deflated.}
