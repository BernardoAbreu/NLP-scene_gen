<D>__{like each other? they hate each other.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{violet}

<C>__{corky}
<D>__{it's getting better and better. keep going.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{gino doesn't know english, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much. he gets right to the pointerior both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.}
