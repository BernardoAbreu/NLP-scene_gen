<L>__{interior gabrielle's apartment night}
<A>__{the apartment is a mess. every single light is on. gabrielle is lounging in a stained nightshirt with a dopey cartoon bear on the front. she's got some sort of pimple medication dabbed on her face. she unconsciously but ferociously bites her nails as she watches tv and talks on the phone. there is no trace of a french accent.}

<D>__{hi. it's nathan.}
<A>__{gabrielle's eyes widen. she jumps up from the couch and starts straightening.}
