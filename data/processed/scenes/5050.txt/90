<A>__{adam sits alone in his empty house. it's a mess. he looks unhinged. he slowly pulls a hit from a joint as he watches matlock on his flat screen tv, which has been moved to the floor to make room for rachel's painting. adam flips the channel to martha stewart, then to i love lucy, then to general hospital, then to body building on espn. he turns the tv off. he's bored. adam crosses to the answering machine. it reads "10 messages." he presses play. all the messages are from his mother. he hits delete. adam reads through a stack of unopened letters. he comes across a postcard from the museum advertising "mountain dew presents: the origins of man".}
