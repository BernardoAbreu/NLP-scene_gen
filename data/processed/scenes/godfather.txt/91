<L>__{int nite: don's room 4a}
<A>__{slowly he pushes the door open, almost afraid at what he will find. he looks. lit by the moonlight through the window, he can see a figure in the hospital bed alone in the room, and under a transparent oxygen tent. all that can be heard is the steady though strained breathing. slowly michael walks up to it, and is relieved to see his father, securely asleep. tubes hang from a steel gallows beside the bed, and run to his nose and mouth.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<A>__{this startles michael; who almost jumps around. it is a nurse lit from the light behind her in the hallway.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{you're not supposed to be here now.}
<A>__{michael calms himself, and moves to her.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i'm michael corleone this is my father. what happened to the detectives who were guarding him?}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{oh your father just had too many visitors. it interfered with the hospital service. the police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago.}
<P>__{(comfortingly)}
<D>__{but don't worry. i look in on him.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you just stand here one minute...}
<A>__{quickly he moves to the telephone, dials a number.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{sonny...sonny jesus christ, i'm down at the hospital. i came down late. there's no one here. none of tessio's people no detectives, no one. the old man is completely unprotected.}
<C>__{sonny }
<D>__{all right, get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside. i will have some men there inside of fifteen minutes. sit tight, and don't panic.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(furiously, but kept inside)}
<D>__{i won't panic.}
<A>__{he hangs up; returns to the nurse...}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{you cannot stay here...i'm sorry.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{you and i are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{absolutely not! we have to get permission from the doctor.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you've read about my father in the papers. you've seen that no one's here to guard him. now i've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him. believe me and help me.}
<C>__{nurse}
<P>__{(frightened)}
<D>__{we don't have to disconnect them, we can wheel the stand with the bed.}
<A>__{she does so...and they perform the very difficult task of moving the bed and the apparatus, out of the room.}
