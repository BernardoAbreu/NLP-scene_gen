<A>__{a rundown (sixties) airport, peeling in the heat. a mad traffic jam of cars, vans, motorbikes all stopped at a checkpoint where a rwandan policeman blows his whistle, waves some and stops others as bored rwandan soldiers look on. close on: a white van pulls out of traffic, a balls out case of line jumping. horns, obscenities. a hand: extends from the passenger side of the van, rwandan francs pressed neatly between thumb and palm. the van stops next to the policeman.}
