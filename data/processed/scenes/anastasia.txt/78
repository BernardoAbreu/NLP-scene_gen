<B>__{a possible vladimir song}
<A>__{vladimir would begin to sing here, telling anya that she has a lot to learn. the music would probably have a light, somewhat comedic tone, and would be just a short section of singing, which would then segue to underscore for the scenes of instruction which follow. we see the three of them from behind, walking down a road meetoo trots behind them, happily.}
<C>__{vladimir }
<D>__{you were born on the adriatic sea at the summer palace, where the parties and the buffets were marvelous ....}
