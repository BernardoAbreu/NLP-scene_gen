<A>__{the second chord sounds. on stage we see a huge nailed fist crash through the wall of a painted dining room set. the giant armoured statue of the commendatore enters pointing his finger in accusation at don giovanni who sits at the supper table, staring his servant leporello quaking with fear under the table.}
<C>__{the commendatore}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{don giovanni!}
<A>__{the figure advances on the libertine. we see mozart conducting, pale and deeply involved. music fades down a little.}
<C>__{old salieri }
<D>__{so rose the dreadful ghost in his next and blackest opera. there on the stage stood the figure of a dead commander calling out 'repent! repent!'}
<A>__{the music swells. we see salieri standing alone in the back of a box, unseen, in semi darkness. we also see that the theatre is only half full. music fades down.}
<C>__{old salieri }
<D>__{and i knew only i understood that the horrifying apparition was leopold, raised from the dead. wolfgang had actually summoned up his own father to accuse his son before all the world. it was terrifying and wonderful to watch.}
