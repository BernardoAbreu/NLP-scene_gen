<L>__{exterior camp night}
<A>__{hector has returned with his precious bottle. francisco by some miracle has two fine crystal glasses. as they drink they begin to reveal a hint of their old intimacy.}
<C>__{francisco}
<D>__{you should hang for this. some people on the raft might have lived with a glass of this in their stomach...}
<A>__{francisco sips the wine with the relish of long abstinence.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i know. i feel very guilty. i brought this too...}
<A>__{hector pulls a cotton bag from under his coat.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{honeyed fruit. the last i have.}
<A>__{francisco can't believe such food still exits. he smiles in anticipation.}
<C>__{francisco}
<D>__{you rogue... give it here...}
<A>__{francisco grabs at the bag and stuffs two or three sweets into his mouth, not so much the gentleman now.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i brought it for ursula...}
<A>__{francisco talks through his munching.}
<C>__{francisco}
<D>__{much too rich for her... do you want to kill her?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{surely... some fruit couldn't...}
<C>__{francisco}
<D>__{don't argue with me, old friend... you're the guilty one around here, and don't you forget it.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{why is it always me? why am i always guilty, always sorry... am i so bad?}
<C>__{francisco}
<D>__{with ursula you weren't bad, you were stupid... you did the one thing you can't do to a strong woman... you took away her pride... what else can she do but hate you?}
<A>__{hector is silent.}
<C>__{francisco}
<D>__{and then you get on the same ship... what a fool...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i had to get home... just like you...}
<C>__{francisco}
<D>__{and when the ship went down... why did you have to get on the same raft... it was as if you were trying to torment her...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{but... the other raft was sinking...}
<C>__{francisco}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{francisco... please...}
<A>__{francisco's face breaks into a smile. they drink the rest of the bottle in silence, the complexity of their friendship having gone beyond words.}
