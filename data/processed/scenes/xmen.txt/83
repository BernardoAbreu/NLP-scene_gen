<L>__{interior westchester mall night}
<A>__{a mother and child wander in a typical shopping daze.}
<B>__{pull out to reveal}
<A>__{crowds of shoppers mill about, a typical crowded evening at the mall. rogue comes up the escalator, wandering through them all. she walks under a high sphered glass ceiling, revealing the night sky outside. she walks over to a victoriais secret store and looks up at the mannequins in the windows who wear almost nothing at all. quite a contrast from her own, stifling garb. she touches the glass as though trying to reach them, then she moves on. rogue's p.o.v. she looks all around the mall at the many oblivious people here. children playing tag on one side. a young couple holding hands. human contact all around. she walks past a small child, her hand nearly brushing the girlis hair. rogue takes a seat on a bench, alone. a figure comes into frame.}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{rogue.}
<A>__{rogue looks up and sees storm standing right in front of her. her eyes dart around, looking for a way out.}
<C>__{storm }
<D>__{you donit have to run.}
<A>__{finally, rogue surrenders.}
<C>__{rogue}
<D>__{iim sorry. iim not like the rest of you iim tired of hurting people.}
<A>__{she starts to cry now.}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{itis okay.}
<C>__{rogue}
<D>__{why did i have to be like this? what purpose does it serve?}
<A>__{and when rogue looks up, she sees another figure this one filling the frame behind storm. a huge clawed hand grabs storm around the throat and lifts her up as she struggles in vain.}
