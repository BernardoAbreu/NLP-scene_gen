<L>__{interior sammy's room. night}
<A>__{sammy, in front of the mirror, finishes dolling herself up for her date. o.c. we hear loud banging. sammy puts on her earrings and goes into }
<L>__{interior hall. continuous}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{are you guys sure you're gonna be ok?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{yes. yes.}
<A>__{sammy approaches rudy and terry. they are bent over a big nasty trench in the floorboard. there are wood shavings and greasy pipe segments all over, and black smeary smudges on the walls nearby.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{what is happening here?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{it's just the problem is that the pipe is corroded all the way along the length of the hall. so every time i put in a new piece it starts leaking further down.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{why don't i just call the plumber?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{why? he's not gonna do anything different than what i'm doing.}
<C>__{rudy}
<P>__{(happily)}
<D>__{yeah. we're making it worse!}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{no we're not. shut up.}
<A>__{terry yanks the wrench and a spray of filthy water comes out of the pipe and splatters the wallpaper and pictures and sammy with gritty gray water. she looks at them.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{thank you. thank you both.}
