<L>__{16mm screen. two banks of floods and a variety of spots}
<A>__{light this part of the room. there is a small control panel on the wall. some of the equipment is ancient but none of it is old. all of it glistens with the affection of its owner. there is absolutely nothing in the room to alarm anyone except an adult... the kind who starts to wonder who paid for it all. close shot of mark. he stands by the lighting panel, watching helen. from his pov we see her brushing the hair out of her eyes as she looks slowly round. he brushes the hair out of his. for a moment she turns her back to him. he presses a switch on the wall. a gentle light ripples through the back of helen's hair. shot of helen. she turns to him. she is very nearly at a loss for words.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{this is so... well so many things... but above all it's so...}
<A>__{she takes a final look round.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{...completely unexpected!}
<A>__{she looks at him searchingly.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{is all of it yours?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i mean... is it designed by you? furnished by you? tell me about this room.}
<A>__{close shot of mark.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{it belonged to my father}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{what was he?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{scientist...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{then this equipment was his?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{no...}
<A>__{he hesitates.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{sold his to buy it...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{but it seems to be so... technical.}
<A>__{she looks at him with renewed interest.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{if this is where you work, i can't wait to see what you work at.}
<A>__{close shot of mark in difficulties.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{don't know what to show you?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{well... what were you looking at when i interrupted you?}
<A>__{he looks at her thoughtfully.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{all right!}
<A>__{he crosses to the corner cupboard opens the door. close shot of the cupboard. we see mark's hand reach for a spool of film... then hesitate, poised above another spool. close shot of helen watching with interest. reverse angle shot of mark. he closes the cupboard, and turns round... there is a spool of film in his hand. he walks slowly towards his projector... he seems for the moment to have forgotten she is there. close shot of helen watching him thread the film into the projector.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{this is the first... twenty first birthday present... i will ever have given.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{it's the first i've ever asked for...}
<A>__{he places a chair a few feet away from the screen and, with an oddly courteous bow, beckons her into it. she sits down. close shot of mark. he looks at her intently for a moment then turns off the lights. over helen's shoulder we can just make out the empty screen. mark switches on the projector. close shot of helen the light flickering on her face. close shot of mark staring at helen's face. close shot of helen. we see her expression of surprise. over mark's shoulder we see the surprise growing. over helen's shoulder we see the screen. we are looking at a small boy. he is lying in his bed asleep. although the print is old, we can see that he is a remarkably handsome boy.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{mark, what a beautiful child.}
<A>__{the boy turns restlessly in his sleep... one of his pillows falls to the floor.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{who is he?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{me}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{of course it is! then who took this film?}
<C>__{mark}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{my father.}
<A>__{a light as if from a small torch starts to shine on the child's eyes. he moves restlessly.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{what a wonderful idea...}
<A>__{the light plays on the child's left eye, then on his right. it is growing brighter.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{you'll be able to show it to your own chi...}
<A>__{the child wakes up suddenly. he stares at something... then starts to scream.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{you must have had a bad dream...}
<A>__{close shot of mark watching her in silence.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{...but what was that light? ...the camera, i suppose?}
<A>__{mark does not answer. the small screen is filled with the face of the screaming, terrified child. (mark's father now tries a not altogether successful dissolve:) we now see the little boy standing in front of a garden wall. he tries hard to climb to the top of the wall, but falls over. helen laughs. mark watches her in silence. small mark tries again and again to scale the wall... at last he succeeds.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{whatever are you after?}
<A>__{we see the little boy lying flat on the wall staring at something... rapt, motionless. the cine camera which is taking this picture now tracks rather clumsily towards the wall. high angle shot over the wall of what is fascinating young mark a man and woman are lying on the ground, kissing. the cine camera pans again rather clumsily to young mark... staring intently.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{naughty boy i hope you were spanked!}
<A>__{close shot of helen. it suddenly occurs to her.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{... but, mark... what a strange thing for your father to photograph.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{switch off?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{she stares again at that lonely figure perched on the wall.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{the small screen begins to dissolve ...so does the large one.}
