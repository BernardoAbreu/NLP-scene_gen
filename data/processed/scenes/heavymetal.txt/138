<D>__{earth? i too am from earth. how did you get here?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{my name is katherine wells, and i'm from the british colony of gibraltar. time makes no diff erence here, but there it was the summer of 1892. it was evening i'd gone for a walk on the cliffs when suddenly a sphere fell from the sky. following its glow, i came to a shining gate made out of light. unable to resist, i stepped through it and awoke in this world. there i was thin and weakly, fit only to stay indoors.}

<A>__{the camera then pulls back to reveal the entwined couple, completely surrounded by a horde of grim, bestial warriors.}
<C>__{dan}
