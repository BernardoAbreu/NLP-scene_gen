<L>__{interior washington, d.c. cocktail lounge night}
<A>__{the same lounge as before. sidney courtney sits at the same table as earlier, only this time with the editor of the washington post, lyman stuart. courtney puffs on his pipe as he speaks.}
<C>__{courtney}
<D>__{... it's strictly rumor at this stage, lyman just something in the wind...}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{something rather big in the wind, i'd say. so whose files were destroyed? the cia's or the fbi's?}
<C>__{courtney}
<D>__{i don't know. like i said, it's just rumor so far, but we should start nosing around, see if we can talk to some people...}
<A>__{the camera begins to slowly move away from their table.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{... but why? the question is why? why would they destroy gardiner's files? what is it about his past they are trying to cover up?}
<P>__{(his voice fades)}
<D>__{... a criminal record? a membership in a subversive organization? homosexual, perhaps?}
<A>__{the sound of stuart's voice dissolves into thomas franklin's as the camera settles on dr. allenby and franklin sitting at a table nearby.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{... and he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. he showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and i... well, i didn't really believe him, of course but why the act?}
<C>__{allenby}
<D>__{i have no idea...}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{another thing that baffles me, doctor what was his connection with the deceased? major financial dealings, obviously but our firm has no record of any such transactions.}
<C>__{allenby}
<D>__{hmmm. you say he showed you his garden?}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.}
<C>__{allenby}
<D>__{i see.}
<P>__{(leans close to franklin)}
<D>__{mr. franklin, i must ask you and miss hayes to keep this incident with mr. gardiner to yourselves. there's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. so please, not a word.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{of course, doctor, i understand.}
<C>__{allenby}
<D>__{fine. thank you, mr. franklin.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{certainly, glad to be of help.}
<A>__{allenby rises, leaves the bar.}
