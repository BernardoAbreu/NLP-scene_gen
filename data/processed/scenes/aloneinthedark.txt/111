<L>__{interior carnby's loft at that moment}
<A>__{the agents fire glowing bullets through the dark loft. there are invisible creatures everywhere.}
<P>__{agent barr (into comm link)}
<D>__{roger that. we're hot.}
<A>__{the muzzle flashes and glowing bullets pierce the darkness of the loft. hadows swim through the space as the invisible creatures move around them, attacking the agents with their razor sharp claws and spiked tails. p.o.v. creature: an invisible creature swoops out of the shadows towards an agent, who is firing in the opposite direction. the creature whips past the agent, slicing him open with a fluid slash of its claws. the creature keeps moving directly for carnby. carnby and aline, standing together, fire their weapons in the darkness, oblivious to the creature rushing towards them. but at the last second, carnby turns instinctively as the creature lunges at him.}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{aline!}
<A>__{carnby and aline turn and open fire on the creature. it flashes visible from multiple hits, flailing off into the darkness. agent barr fires controlled bursts of glowing bullets into the dark loft. he screams into his comm link.}
<P>__{agent barr (into comm link)}
<D>__{where the hell's our back up?}
<P>__{krash (on the comm link)}
<D>__{landing.}
<A>__{the sound of a helicopter can be heard outside the loft. p.o.v. creature: another invisible creature skirts along the edge of a wall, avoiding the gunfire. it locates its target, an agent firing up at the ceiling. it races towards the agent. the agent turns to the attack and tries to fire. but the creature is too fast. it slams the agent back against the wall and impales him with its spiked tail. agents barr and cheung spot this and open fire on the creature. it flails about, fading visible from the impacts. the creature tries to scurry away, but barr and cheung are on it. with precision and speed, they blow the creature away. but more creatures attack. the fighting is fierce. glowing bullets streak through the darkness. the agents are calm and determined as they engage the creatures. carnby and aline hold their own, sticking together, shooting at whatever shadows move around them. six agents in full combat gear burst into the loft. leading the unit is commander burke. agent miles is with him, as is agent turner (mid 30s). burke, miles, turner, and the other agents immediately join the battle, laying down suppressing fire. an agent carrying a rifle mounted grenade launcher fires an incendiary flash grenade at the upper level of the loft. with a flash of blinding light, the grenade explodes. creatures squeal as flames swoop up through the upper level. glowing bullets fill the dark loft. creatures squeal and flail from the hits. in the darkness of the loft, carnby, aline, and the agents finish off the remaining invisible creatures. the last creature goes down in a hail of glowing bullets. the agents strafe the creature's corpse to make sure it's dead. agent barr and carnby exchange a look between them. barr clearly respects carnby's abilities. the loft is still dark. barr's rifle mounted scanner no longer registers any creatures.}
<C>__{agent barr}
<D>__{we're clear, sir.}
<A>__{burke looks around at the remains of the battle. the loft is totally trashed. a small fire burns in the upper level.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{love what you've done with the place, carnby.}
<A>__{miles runs a hand held scanning device over john's corpse. the scanner beeps, indicating the presence of a spinal worm.}
<C>__{agent miles}
<D>__{sir, this one's infected too!}
<A>__{agent turner scans the female orphan's corpse. his scanning device beeps. she has a spinal worm too.}
<C>__{agent turner}
<D>__{got another one here!}
<A>__{burke immediately turns his weapon to carnby. the red laser sight makes a glowing dot on carnby's chest. taking their cue from burke, the other agents in his unit all train their weapons on carnby. several glowing red dots hover on his chest.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{drop your weapon and get down on the ground.}
<C>__{aline}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{he's been infected with some kind of organism. he could be under its control.}
<A>__{aline turns to carnby.}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{it's true. i've got one inside me. but it's not controlling me.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{you'll excuse me if i don't take your word for it. now drop your weapon.}
<A>__{carnby holds his weapon at his side. he doesn't drop it. but he doesn't move either. aline steps in between carnby and the agents. the red dots are now trained on her chest.}
<C>__{agent turner}
<D>__{get out of the way!}
<A>__{the agents try to get a clear shot around aline.}
<C>__{aline}
<D>__{he's not one of them.}
<C>__{urke}
<D>__{if i've got to shoot through you to get to him, i will do it.}
<A>__{carnby looks up at the lights. they are still dark.}
<C>__{carnby}
<D>__{why are the lights still out?}
<A>__{barr consults his scanner. it isn't registering anything.}
<C>__{agent barr}
<D>__{scanner's clear.}
<P>__{agent miles (into comm link)}
<D>__{krash?}
<P>__{krash (on the comm link)}
<D>__{negative.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{forget to pay your power bill, carnby?}
<A>__{an agent standing at the other end of the loft hears something shuffling behind him. he turns to look. something grabs the agent, slams him back against the wall, and rips out his neck. it's another orphan, with the same fierce, gaunt look and clear irises. burke turns away from carnby for a moment, trying to figure out what's happening. carnby suddenly lifts his weapon and points it at burke. burke sees this, but before he can react, carnby fires. carnby's bullet whizzes past burke and hits an orphan dead center in the gut, sending him flailing back, dead. the orphan was about to pounce on burke. there's a moment as burke and carnby look at one another. burke realizes carnby just saved his life. the orphans attack. they are the grown up children from carnby's orphanage. like pinkerton, they are difficult to kill, immune to pain, fast, and deadly. they all have the same gaunt, wild look, with sunken eyes and nearly clear irises. the orphans leap out at the agents, quick and fierce. they bite and claw and use their superhuman strength to throw around the agents and tear them apart. the dark loft is again lit up with glowing bullets, streaking through the darkness. the agents' rifle mounted lamps shine around, but the effect is chaotic, disorienting. as the orphans attack, they make quick work of many of the agents. glowing bullets fly around everywhere. the screams of agents being torn apart mix with bursts of automatic gunfire. carnby and aline stay together, dodging the attacking orphans, and firing into the darkness. an orphan rises up behind carnby. he spins and shoots her in the side. but she just keep coming. carnby shoots the orphan again, this time dead center in the chest. the orphan collapses, dead. carnby checks the corpse. the bullet came out the other side. a mixture of red blood and black, sticky ooze drips from a bullet hole right over the orphan's spine. carnby grabs the comm link off the body of a dead agent.}
<P>__{carnby (into comm link)}
<D>__{all agents! you've got to kill the organism to stop them! aim for the spine!}
<A>__{cross the loft, burke listens to the comm link. an orphan is attacking agent miles. burke takes careful aim and shoots the orphan in the back, right on the spine. the orphan falls over, dead.}
<P>__{burke (into comm link)}
<D>__{confirmed. spinal shot's a kill shot.}
<A>__{with this information, the agents quickly gain the upper hand against the orphans' attack. the orphans are fast and deadly, but they have no organization. now that the agents have a handle on this new threat, their precision and speed returns. soon, the battle is over. dozens of bodies of dead agents and dead orphans lie littered around carnby's destroyed loft. only carnby, aline, burke, miles, barr, cheung, marko, and turner remain alive. burke's and carnby's eyes meet. burke approaches carnby. the other agents all stand by, waiting for an order from burke. aline watches them, ready to step in.}
<C>__{burke }
<D>__{you remember the number one rule they teach you in 713 training? trust your instincts.}
<A>__{burke and carnby face off.}
<C>__{burke }
<D>__{fischer's missing. so is hudgens. and i've got a situation brewing that makes this scrap look like a bar brawl.}
<C>__{aline}
<D>__{what does hudgens have to do with this?}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{that's what i want to find out. i need you both to brief me in the air.}
<A>__{burke turns to walk off, but then stops. he turns back to carnby. burke holds out his hand.}
<C>__{burke }
<D>__{oh, and carnby... i will need my i d back.}
<A>__{carnby smirks. he pulls out burke's i d card and hands it back to him.}
