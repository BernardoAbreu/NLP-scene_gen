<D>__{that's not your goddamn business.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{it is my business, because it's not true. the organizers of the reading needed a title. they picked one a sensational one, i admit to attract a crowd.}
<C>__{perry}
<D>__{they picked it.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{perry}
<D>__{that's not your title.}

<D>__{you pretend to be my friend...}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{how could i choose a title when you still haven't told me what happened that night? how could i? i couldn't possibly.}
<A>__{long pause. truman reaches in his breast pocket and extracts a photo (the one of perry and linda splashing in the puddle.)}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{i have something from your sister.}
<A>__{he hands it through the bars to perry. perry takes it.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{she misses you.}

<A>__{perry sits on the bed. then, almost to himself:}
<C>__{perry}
<D>__{there must be something wrong with us. to do what we did.}
<A>__{truman waits him out, sitting on the chair. finally, perry looks at him. when perry speaks, it is quietly, completely matter of fact.}
<C>__{perry}
<D>__{we heard there was ten thousand dollars in that house. once we'd tied up everybody and searched all over, i knew the guy who told us about it was wrong. there wasn't any money. but dick wouldn't believe it. he went tearing through the house again, banging on the walls, looking for a safe. he said when he was done, he was going to come up to nancy's room and have his way with her. i wouldn't allow it. i told him that. i sat with nancy.}
