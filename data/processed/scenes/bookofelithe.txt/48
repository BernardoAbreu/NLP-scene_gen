<L>__{exterior desolate road day}
<A>__{solara wanders the road. she's tired. the sun beats down mercilessly. nothing but desolation and wasteland all around. she comes to a fork in the road. stops at the junction, unsure. was this here before? she doesn't remember. there are no signs. both paths look the same. which one is which? she turns and looks back, looks around. she's lost.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{shit. shit.}
<A>__{she alternates her finger between the two paths. eeny meeny miney moe. picks a path and follows it, headed down the road.}
