<L>__{exterior bag end day}
<A>__{wide on: gandalf's cart pulls up outside the gate to bag end...a particularly fine example of a hobbit hole, with a large round front door set into a grassy hillside. there is a sign on the gate which reads: "no admittance except on party business." gandalf strides up to the garden path of bag end. he raises his staff and raps on the front door...a voice calls out:}
<C>__{bilbo }
<D>__{no, thank you! we don't want any more visitors, well wishers, or distant relations.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{and what about very old friends?}
<A>__{suddenly the door opens and bilbo baggins stands before him. he is a hobbit of indertiminate age, with a mischievous twinkle in his eye. wearing a dashing brocade waist coat, he looks every inch the eccentric gentleman.}
<C>__{bilbo}
<D>__{gandalf?}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{bilbo baggins!}
<C>__{bilbo}
<D>__{my dear gandalf!}
<A>__{gandalf drops to his knee to embrace his old friend.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{it's good to see you. one hundred and eleven years old, who would believe it!}
<A>__{gandalf looks at him more keenly.}
<C>__{gandalf }
<D>__{you haven't aged a day! gandalf and bilbo laugh together and enter bag end.}
<C>__{bilbo}
<D>__{come on, come in! welcome, welcome!!}
