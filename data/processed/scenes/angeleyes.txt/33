<L>__{interior catch's apartment building corridor next day}
<A>__{candace, catch's neighbor, is waiting for the slow, rattling elevator with her son. the elevator door opens and there is catch, seated on a newly bought wicker chair in the elevator with a small table across his lap, other boxes nearby and a long stemmed rose in his hand, wrapped for giving.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{oh. sorry.}
<A>__{he rises and hurriedly gets his purchases off the elevator so the woman and little boy can enter.}
<C>__{candace}
<D>__{shopping day?}
<A>__{he smiles at her, a bit less subdued than before as he gets his things into the hall and he manages a special look for tommy, a wink. he frees the elevator; they step inside. as the door starts to close, catch's face "follows" the sliding door with a funny look for the boy. we hear tommy laugh as the door closes. catch carries his new possessions to his apartment.}
