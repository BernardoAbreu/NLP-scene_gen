<A>__{it is quiet except for the slight sounds of lapping water and an occasional wooden creak as the floating docks strain against one another. there are a few big police launches still docked in the marina. they bob about silently. the chain, which normally restricted the area, is broken and dangling. the sign, which reads city of philadelphia police no admittance clangs against the broken chain in the wind. halfway down the long dock is a little guard house. inside, sitting at a radio transmitter, is the corpse of a uniformed guard. nearby is a separate floating dock on which is painted a large square pattern. it is a landing bay for police helicopters. alongside, afloat separately but securely chained fast, is a small fuel barge, with pumps and hoses for refueling the chopper and launches. the other bodies lie bleeding on the bobbing docks, another officer and a civilian. a bell buoy rings in the distance and we begin to hear the sound of an approaching helicopter. the blades of the j.a.s. traffic copter whine as they gear down for a landing. the whirlybird settles like a hummingbird on the gently bobbing heliport.}
