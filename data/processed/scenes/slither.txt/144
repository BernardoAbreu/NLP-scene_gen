<A>__{bill grabs hammers and nails off a hardware bench. trevor knocks things off shelves and yanks up the metal shelving. starla looks doubtful of this whole activity. but still, she helps. the storeroom has two doors. they start nailing anything over them they can. trevor sees some slithering parasites coming in through a crack in the upper corner of the room.}

<D>__{goddamn snakes!!}
<A>__{trevor aims his pistol at the things and starts shooting wildly at them, blasting up the whole room. bill and starla see slithering parasites coming in from other cracks in the room as well. they also blast at them. dust is all around; they can hardly see. bill runs out of ammo. he grabs a hand held black and decker electric circular saw and turns it on. he starts jamming it into the parasites, cutting them up, and putting big slices in the floor. they squeak with pain.}
