<L>__{interior the castorini house kitchen day}
<A>__{a red hot, well seasoned cast iron frying pan receives a big lump of butter with a hissing gasp of satisfaction. a wooden spoon pushes the sinking lump around until the pan is coated. two square slices of yellow bread with round holes punched in their middles land in the pan. two circles of green pepper land next to the bread. a spatula flips over the bread which has become glistening gold on the cooked side. two eggs are broken and dropped sunnyside into the holes in the bread. the circles of green pepper are pushed around by the spatula, scooped up deftly, and each is made to frame one of the eggs. a woman's hand garnishes each bright yellow yolk with a slash of red pimento. the spatula reappears and lifts the results from the pan, and slides them onto two small dark blue plates. now we see that loretta is just finishing setting the tin table for two. in the b.g., rose is turning away from the big, old fashioned six range gas stove where an old speckled coffee pot is steaming up a sun drenched window. rose comes toward the table with the laden blue plates. she's wearing a nice old apron over a blue housedress. she's thoughtful. as rose comes to the table, loretta in a blue denim work shirt and pants, goes to the stove and gets the coffee. as rose puts breakfast on the table, she speaks to loretta, who's at the stove.}
