<A>__{(124) interior club night celebration! everyone is jumping up and down. prince is radiant, strutting across the stage, his hands upraised. the crowd goes wild! he flashes a wide grin to vanity, then twists, eyeballs the crowd wickedly, wonderfully. it's too much! everyone is joining in now. even morris and jerome, standing in the wings, start dancing like crazy. then suddenly they catch themselves, stop, act dignified. but vanity sees them and busts up. they catch her look, laugh heartily and join in again. the music segues into a fierce beat. the crowd lets out a roar! prince strips off his guitar, streaks center stage. the band launches into "baby, i'm a star." ...and the crowd laughing, dancing, shouting and loving. the club is alive! and the music continues...forever...}
