<L>__{exterior ford plantation day}
<A>__{ january, 1842 seasons have passed. it is winter now, and very grey out along the bayou. ford and tibeats who we have seen working around the work area stand with solomon, tibeats giving solomon an inspection. ford carries much lament.}
<C>__{tibeats}
<D>__{raise yer shirt.}
<A>__{solomon does as instructed. tibeats looks at solomon's back, at the scars from lashings he bears.}
<P>__{tibeats (contâ€™d)}
<D>__{troublesome.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{he's a good carpenter and quick witted.}
<C>__{tibeats}
<D>__{i am familiar with his cleverness.}

<A>__{tibeats heads off. solomon, highly curious over the preceding.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{sir, have i done something wrong?}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{not your concern, platt. i say with much...shame i have compiled debts. i have long preached austerity, but find myself hypocritical in that regard. you'll be in the ownership of mr. tibeats. you are his now. serve him as you'd serve me.}

<C>__{ford}
<D>__{and your faithfulness will not be forgotten.}
