<D>__{you made it. the kids are just coming. they're not over the moon about going to the beach house. i ought to warn you.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{why didn't you say? i could have fixed up something else. i thought it would be a good place to get to know them again...}
<C>__{janet}
<D>__{well, i figured you should be allowed to make your own mistakes. it's only for a couple of nights, they can take it... and you'll learn... check into a hotel if it gets too much... they like hotels.}
<A>__{she shouts into the house.}
<C>__{janet}
<D>__{come on, you two... your father's ready to go...}
<A>__{she hands hector a piece of paper.}
<C>__{janet}
<D>__{this is where we'll be, if anything crops up... thanks for the break...}
<A>__{hector gets a little scared about what he has taken on.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{maybe this is a bit sudden for them... maybe i should have come over a couple of nights and got to know them...}
<A>__{janet doesn't let him off the hook.}

<C>__{janet}
<D>__{here he is, the invisible dad.}
<A>__{she turns to hector.}
<C>__{janet}
<D>__{that's what they call you.}
<A>__{hector is daunted by how grown up they are, not any more the little kids in the photograph in his wallet.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{they hardly lift their heads to him.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{janet takes control of the farewells.}
<C>__{janet}
<D>__{you three have a good weekend. if it's too miserable at the house your father said he'll take you to a hotel.}
<A>__{hector nods his head obediently. he always did with janet. the children let their mother pat them and follow hector to his car, eyes to the ground.}
<C>__{janet}
<D>__{good luck, hector.}
<A>__{donald shouts from behind the wheel of his car, where he has been hiding.}
<C>__{donald}
<D>__{see you monday, hector.}
<A>__{the kids load themselves into the back of hector's car. betsy notices the huge arrangement of flowers, wrapped in cellophane and red ribbon. it seems to have grown even larger than before.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{are those for mom?}
<A>__{hector looks at the flowers. his face contorts in guilt and anxiety.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{oh no... jesus save me... what have i done...}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<A>__{he picks up his mobile phone and is about to dial anna's number, then he stops.}
<C>__{hector}

<C>__{hector}
<D>__{let's go.}
