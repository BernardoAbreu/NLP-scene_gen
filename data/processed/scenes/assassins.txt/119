<A>__{electra steps out of the hotel room ready for the beach. at the end of the hall, she sees the newlywed couple get on the elevator. she starts to call to them to hold it for her, but she stops herself. the elevator closes. she edges slowly down the hall, stopping outside the door to their suite. she touches it with the tips of her fingers.}

<A>__{rath is still at the table. the curtain begins to billow, a soft breeze blowing through the open patio door. they swell open and fall. it seems for a moment that there is a figure, a shadow, in the changing shape of the curtain. rath stands. he walks to the open door. standing in the frame, he looks out at the blue ocean below. he slides the door closed, and the curtains fall still.}
