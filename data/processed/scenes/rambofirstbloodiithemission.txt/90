<L>__{exterior sampan}
<A>__{the patrol boat pulls up in an arc, almost swamping them. the soldiers on deck wear the uniforms of the north vietnamese navy. the deck gunner racks the bolt on his r.p.k. machine gun. the captain shouts rapid vietnamese on a loud hailer. kinh's men lounge on the sampan indolently, looking like fishermen on an evening trawl. the scrawny woman feeds an infant at one sagging breast. the patrol captain draws his service pistol and jumps down into the sampan, entering the cabin. co sits demurely on one bunk as kinh greets the officer. the officer begins poking through kinh's possessions. he tugs at the crate under the bunk where rambo lies concealed.}
<B>__{tight on rambo}
<A>__{absolutely motionless. the crate beside his head moves. the officer's boot is visible through a widening crack. an argument in vietnamese is heard heating up.}
<B>__{brewer}
<A>__{grips the mac 11 tightly, releases, grips, releases. sweat runs into his eyes.}
<B>__{the officer}
<A>__{looks severe as he contemptuously thumbs through a sheaf of bills. kinh, gesticulating pathetically adds some more to the stack. after a tense moment the officer kicks the crate next to rambo and stalks out, tucking the payola in his tunic. he jumps off the sampan and the patrol boat roars on.}
