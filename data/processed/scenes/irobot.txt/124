<D>__{detective spooner. dr. calvin. i was hoping to see you again.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{hi, sonny.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{how is your investigation coming? any new suspects?}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{we're working on it.}
<A>__{sonny. hands spooner the drawing. spooner. doesn't really know what to do with it.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{dr. lanning provided me with paper and pencils. i think it amused him to see me try to draw. you were right, though, detective...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i cannot create a great work of art.}
<A>__{spooner. despite himself. looks down at the drawing a charcoal sketch of moody abstract figures. inhabiting a stark landscape. a strangely shaped structure to one side. concentric circles, throughout.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{i think it's pretty good.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{it's a dream i had. this is the place where robots meet. look...}
<P>__{(pointing to the drawing)}
<D>__{...you can see them here. they see themselves as slaves.}
<A>__{spooner shifts his weight. uncomfortable with what sonny's saying.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{...and this man on the hill comes. to set them free. and you know who that man is?}
<A>__{spooner. exchanging a look with calvin.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{that man in the dream is you.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{why do you say that? is that a normal dream?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{it's not a dream, sonny. ns 2s process the images and events of the day. sometimes they're out of sequence. disorienting.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{whatever it is, it's normal enough for someone in your situation.}
<A>__{sonny. suddenly pleased.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{hah i caught you. you said someone. not something.}
<A>__{spooner. drops the drawing on the table.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{sonny, we're here to ask you an important question about dr. hogenmiller.}
<A>__{spooner, reaching into his pocket...}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{i need you to take a look at this...}
<A>__{...when sonny's hand. suddenly reaches out. to stop him. cocks his head, for a moment.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{thank you for coming to see me, detective spooner.}
<A>__{spooner. confused. looks over at calvin. why did he stop him? just then. they hear footsteps. approaching the door. victor. suddenly appearing over the table...}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{i'm sorry, detective spooner. no unauthorised personnel permitted in this holding cell...}
<A>__{the cell door. slides open. and a pissed lanning steps inside. shoots a withering glare. at calvin. sonny. folds up the drawing.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{please take this, detective. to remember me by. i have a feeling someday it may mean more to you than it ever could to me.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{why's that?}
<A>__{sonny leans in to hand it to spooner. lowering his voice...}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{because the man in my dream, the one standing by the hill.}
<C>__{sonny }
<D>__{it wasn't me...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{...it was you.}
<A>__{a chill. ripping down spooner's spine. as lanning. takes his arm.}
