<A>__{a man walks round with a hand bell announcing that the park is closing. he turns off the gaslights which illuminate the animal cages. almasy and katharine sit stiffly on a bench. they don't speak. almasy puts his hands to his head, he rubs his shoulders. the lights are gradually being extinguished around them.}
<D>__{finally, katharine gets up.}
<C>__{katharine}
<D>__{i'd better get back.}
<P>__{(she keeps him away with a hand)}
