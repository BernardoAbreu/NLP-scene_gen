<L>__{exterior jungle dawn}
<A>__{as a purple dawn dissolves the night sky, the survivors stagger on, exhausted. some are starting to tire, and there are spaces in the column. malcolm's limp seems to be getting worse. nick reaches out, to take malcolm's pack, but malcolm swats his hand away. kelly, still ahead of him, falls into step with sarah.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i don't think my dad doesn't think we're going to make it.}
<A>__{sarah looks at her.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{your dad is wrong. about a lot more than he knows.}
<A>__{she puts an arm around her. kelly looks up at her, grateful. the long march continues. up at the front, nick catches up to roland.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i think you should call a break.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{another half hour.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{some of them won't make another half hour. we didn't come this far to start dropping in the middle of the jungle. if you don't call it, i will.}
<A>__{roland looks at him, steely, then shouts to the group.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{five minutes break!}
<A>__{immediately, the marchers drop where they stood, absolutely drained. at the rear of the group, drs. burke and juttson are bickering.}
<C>__{juttson}
<D>__{i can't believe you're still angry about that.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{you know, it's very easy to criticize the first person who studies something.}
<C>__{juttson}
<D>__{no, it's easy to criticize sloppy research and hasty conclusions.}
<A>__{nearby, malcolm checks nick's bag of videotapes, making sure they're still dry and undamaged. sarah comes up, watching him.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{you know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax. ian malcolm's alien autopsy.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{maybe. maybe not.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{ian, they will misplace our evidence, shoot holes in our testimony, and say some special effects genius created the animals. the only way people will ever believe that dinosaurs exist is if you dump a t rex in the middle of times square.}
<A>__{he doesn't look at her. she sits down beside her.}
<C>__{sarah }
<D>__{there's something more important that you should be thinking about instead.}
<A>__{behind them, dr. burke, furious, has stalked away from juttson and sits down on a rock. h does a double take, noticing something behind the rock. he leans over and picks it up. it's an oval shape about eight inches long, with a pebbled exterior. a dinosaur egg. burke's face lights up, fascinated, and he carefully pieces the egg in a satchel he wears over one shoulder. at the rear of the group, dieter stark pulls a wad of toilet paper from his pack, drops the pack on the ground, and turns to the hunter nearest him carter, his driver, who has his back turned.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{wait here for me, would ya carter?}
<A>__{he steps off the path, into the jungle. but as we come around the front of carter, we see he's wearing a walkman, the headphone blaring tinnily in his ears. and he didn't hear a word.}
