<L>__{interior courthouse day}
<A>__{ned enters the cavernous marble rotunda, turns down a hallway crowded with milling attorneys and defendants. lola suddenly intercepts him... a newspaper trailing from her high heel shoe.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{who's frank?}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{frank? the only frank i know is an auto mechanic... but i sure as hell wouldn't recommend the guy. he's really slow.}
<A>__{he starts to move off, but she stops him, impassioned.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{i had to see you, ned. i need to feel your arms around me! i wanna suck your toes til the nails pop off!}
<A>__{lola's voice echoes. bystanders gather, listening. ned looks around self consciously, embarrassed.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{i told you, what happened was a big mistake. a one night stand. it's over. i have a wife...}
<A>__{the crowd presses closer... not missing a thing. a woman snaps a flash picture! a man turns on his video camera.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{it doesn't matter. she'll know all about us soon anyway. i want you! in my bed... in my arms... in meeeeeee!}
<A>__{mortified, ned spins on his heels and makes a bee line for the safety of the men's room. lola holds up two tickets.}
<C>__{lola}

<D>__{i hate opera!}
