<A>__{chris leans into the hole, his jacket restricts his entry. chris pulls out of the hole, standing to reveal a large male tarantula on his back. chris is oblivious as he takes off his jacket. the coat lands in a heap atop the spider. chris gets back down and places one of the rat traps in the hole. he doesn't notice the jacket moving behind him. chris backs out of the hole. he picks up his jacket. the spider is gone. he grabs his traps and heads upstairs.}
