<L>__{into lucian with the impact of a truck. both hit the floor.}
<A>__{lucian points his gun at bud's head, who reaches for the trigger guard, shifts the barrel an inch a round goes off, blowing through bud's shoulder he yells out, hooks his finger in the trigger, stopping the next shot. bud flips lucian over, rips the gun away. lucian tries to break free. bud grabs him smashes the gun over and over against lucian's face. lucian's head bounces. eyes roll, then right. lucian quarter rolls, then cracks a forearm into bud's head. again, and bud is knocked back with a gash over his eye. lucian rears back and kicks hard into bud's sternum. lucian scrambles. bud tackles him into a table, which goes down. a chair breaks. bud lands a thunderous hook and lucian's nose shatters. another and his cheekbone caves. lucian drops like a rock. tries to crawl under another table. in a maniacal rage, bud flips the table and stomps down on lucian with furious blows that come one after another. lucian tries to cover up. bud is all over him. grabs lucian by the throat and presses down. lucian, fighting to breathe, digs his nails into bud's face, tearing skin. bud's face twists with hate as he chokes the life out of him. lucian's eyes bulge...his mouth stretches wide...clutching at bud's fingers, trying to pull away... bud snorts, tightens his grip... bearing down... and at the last moment, the cop in him reemerges... bud lets go. lucian rolls to his side and coughs up a thick ribbon of blood and vomit. bud slams on restraints. bud staggers to his feet...breathing hard...spots jesse on the floor...and he slows... jesse lies in shadow. perfectly still. we cannot see his face. only the dark pool of blood around him. lucian passes out.}

<B>__{slowly pull away and track over the massacre...}
<A>__{...as police come in...over bodies and blood and guns, and up the stairs and out a broken window, to the crowds in the street held back by police, past flashing lights and emergency vehicles... ...to where life goes on in new orleans.}
