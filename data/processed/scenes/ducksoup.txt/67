<T>__{cut back to:}
<A>__{groucho's headquarters. groucho is discovered there alone, stropping his sword on a razor strap attached to his desk. chico enters... goes to time clock on wall, puts his workman's card in it and punches it. groucho, attracted by the bell of the time clock, stops stropping and walks over to chico, with sword in hand.}
<C>__{groucho}
<D>__{late again, eh? you haven't been on time once since this war started...}
<P>__{(puts sword in sheath)}
<D>__{get out there and fight...}
<P>__{(pointing commandingly}
<D>__{in direction of battle}
<P>__{field)}
<C>__{chico}
<D>__{i can't do it...}
<C>__{groucho}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{why not? you're the secretary of war, aren't you?}
<C>__{chico}
<D>__{yes, but i'm not working for you any more. i'm on the other side.}
<C>__{groucho}
<P>__{(like a surprised child)}
<D>__{is that so? i used to think you were two faced but you can't be or you wouldn't be wearing that one. now let's talk this thing over.}
<A>__{groucho sits down at desk and chico pulls up another chair and sits at opposite side of desk facing groucho}
<C>__{groucho}
<P>__{(blowing out a puff of smoke)}
<D>__{now how many men you got in your army?}
<C>__{chico}
<D>__{well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.}
<C>__{groucho}
<D>__{that's not fair we've only got fifty thousand.}
<C>__{chico}
<D>__{that's all right. we let you have twenty five thousand men and we both start even.}
<C>__{groucho}
<P>__{(enthusiastically)}
<D>__{that's the spirit fifty fifty.}
<C>__{chico}
<D>__{no. seventy five seventy five.}
<C>__{groucho}
<D>__{well, we'll let that one go. now how many battalions you got?}
<C>__{chico}
<D>__{we gotta two battalions and one frenchman.}
<C>__{groucho}
<D>__{i wish you were still working for me, so i could ask you to resign. how're ya fixed for cavalry?}
<C>__{chico}
<D>__{i've gotta five thousand men but no horses.}
<C>__{groucho}
<D>__{that's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.}
<C>__{chico}
<D>__{that's all right our men can ride your horses.}
<C>__{groucho}
<D>__{not a bad idea. if our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change.}
<P>__{(chico nods agreeingly)}
<D>__{now, i don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.}
<C>__{chico}
<D>__{oh, sure. we have horse maneuvers every morning.}
<A>__{at this point, an unusually large shell comes crashing from above, imbedding itself, point down, in the floor without exploding. groucho and chico rush over to look at it.}
<C>__{groucho}
<P>__{(looking at shell)}
<D>__{acme ammunition company, eh? how do you expect to win the war with shells that don't go off? now, if you were buying your stuff from me, you wouldn't have that trouble. eureka ammunition is guaranteed to explode or your money back. let me show you some samples.}
<A>__{groucho opens door and yells to some one outside}
<C>__{groucho}
<D>__{bring in no. 47, line 8.}
<A>__{harpo enters, bent forward, tugging at a rope which tightens over his shoulder, in the manner of a volga boatman... at the end of the rope is a cannon, on two wheels}
<C>__{groucho}
<P>__{(pointing to gun)}
<D>__{that's our latest number... our sixteen inch horowitz gun.}
<P>__{(to harpo)}
<D>__{load it up.}
<A>__{harpo pours a great quantity of powder into the cannon, then to make sure he has enough, he lights a match and looks into the hole. groucho takes the lighted match from harpo. he lights his own cigar, hands the match back to harpo. harpo pours in a little more powder, makes sure he has enough, then proceeds to ram the powder in the barrel with his horn. he rises and moves to wall toward which the cannon is pointed. he draws a target on the wall with a piece of chalk goes back to cannon. he picks up the firing string, and faces the target toward which the cannon is pointing. chico puts his fingers into his ears. groucho picks up a pencil from desk taps it on desk then raises both hands, in the manner of an orchestra leader. he holds this pose for a second and on the down beat, harpo jerks the string and there is a terrific explosion. the cannon fires out the back end instead of the front and blows a hole through the back wall. the two stare off in the direction of the hole. groucho turns to chico.}
<C>__{groucho}
<D>__{with a gun like that you can kill some of your own men.}
<C>__{chico}
<D>__{that's a pretty good. i will take a dozen of them.}
<C>__{groucho}
<D>__{anything else?}
<P>__{(writing order on pad)}
<C>__{chico}
<P>__{(mentally figuring)}
<D>__{yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand grenades, three kegs of powder and throw in some matches.}
<C>__{groucho}
<P>__{(writing)}
<D>__{fine. we'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery. by the way, how're you fixed for spys?}
<C>__{chico}
<D>__{fine. we gotta him.}
<P>__{(he indicates harpo)}
<C>__{groucho}
<D>__{so! he's on your side, too.}
<C>__{chico}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{groucho}
<D>__{well, with you two fellows on the other side, this country should have no trouble keeping the wolf from the door.}
<A>__{harpo opens the door and discloses a dozen or more snarling wolves at the door.}
