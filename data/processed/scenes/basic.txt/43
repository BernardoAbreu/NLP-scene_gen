<D>__{it was the regular tuesday night drill. he'd let us sleep for an hour and then wake us up, drag us out to the bayou, and work us all night, separate from the others. the door slams open, revealing west.}

<D>__{oh, yeah, "excuse me, sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out we don't want to get rained on." he'll kick our asses from here to cleveland.}
