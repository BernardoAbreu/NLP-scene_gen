<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior carrie's bedroom asb day}
<A>__{carrie's bag is open on the bed with the russian's gun next to it. she's trying to put on a clean flannel over a t shirt, but can't button it up with only one hand. her frustration mounts as she fights back every bit of emotion that's trying to get out. she finally gives up kicks over a nearby chair that sweeps the stuff off her bed. bag and gun go flying. carrie slumps to the floor. silent tears. after a beat she notices pryce standing in the doorway with some papers in his hand. he's looking at her compassionately.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{i stopped by the clinic... doc told me.}
<A>__{carrie nods, pulling herself together, swallowing her emotion.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{pretty tough marshal, huh?}
<A>__{he enters. holds out her ring for her.}
<C>__{carrie }
<P>__{(holds up hand with missing ring finger)}
<D>__{if you came to propose, now's not really a good time.}
<A>__{he joins her. hands over her ring. takes a seat next to her.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{anything?}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{got rubin's face all over antarctica, but nobody's seen him yet.}
<A>__{they sit in silence together for a moment. carrie sees the russian pistol that's ended up on the floor close by. picks it up. examines it like a relic.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{...you ever kill anyone?}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{...unfortunately.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{anyone you ever trusted?}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{i hadn't held a gun in my hand for over two years.}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{wasn't supposed to need one down here.}
<A>__{she looks at him }
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{you asked what i was running away from...i came down here to forget my partner, jack. thought it would be better than any therapy.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{we were on a stakeout at a holiday inn in miami, waiting for this buy to go down. i was excited, we'd been after this trafficker for a long time. thought this bust would be my big chance to impress the brass. anyway, guy's a no show. one hour went by, then two nothing.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{then jack starting acting strange. next thing i knew my face was being rammed into a mirror. my own partner was trying to kill me. turns out the whole bust was a set up from the start. jack was dirty, working with the guy we were after.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{four years together. i knew things about him that his wife didn't even know.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but he was my partner and i killed him that night. there's no changing that.}
<A>__{pryce takes it all in. not the story he expected.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{marshall service cleared me ruled it self defense, but i had a real hard time getting over the betrayal how little my life meant to a guy i was willing to take a bullet for.}
<A>__{carrie shifts in her chair. leans forward.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{know what the kicker is jack thought i was close to figuring him out. thought this hotel room was the best place to get rid of me make it look like a bust gone bad. truth is, i had no idea.}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{god, i was young and stupid, and in way over my head.}
<A>__{she stands. pryce joins her.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{you asked me why i smell like suntan lotion jack wore aramis, this cheap after shave his wife gave him. some of the guys down here wear it suntan lotion is the only thing that keeps me from smelling it.}
<A>__{she notices the papers he's holding; faxed photos of}
<B>__{three different types of cannisters with russian writing on them.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{what do ya got there?}
<A>__{he shows them to her. one by one.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{it's what the russians used to transport weapons grade materials in. they match the dimensions inside the safe. we're looking for six of these.}
<A>__{as carrie studies them }
<C>__{pryce }
<D>__{langley's thinking it might be hexafluoride, which is a derivative of uranium. it's a component for nuclear detonation.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{these beakers where really in over their heads.}
<A>__{the radio on pryce's hip crackles...}
<C>__{rhonda }
<D>__{dinkle, it's rhonda }
<A>__{pryce smirks.}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{i better get this back to him. and we have to find rubin.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{think you can you help me with these buttons, first?}
<C>__{pryce}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{he moves closer. starts to button her up.}
<C>__{pryce }
<D>__{for what it's worth i think you're pretty tough, marshall.}
