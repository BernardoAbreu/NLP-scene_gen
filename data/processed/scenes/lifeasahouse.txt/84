<L>__{exterior george's garage morning}
<A>__{adam runs with abandon to sam and alyssa as robin helps george to a patio chair.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{adam runs into sam with a hug, then steps back.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{what's that for?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{mom said i should.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i would have anyway.}
<A>__{sam appears awkward as he rests his hand for a second on adam's shoulder.}
<C>__{adam }
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i'm his brother.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i'm his friend.}
<A>__{adam views her suspiciously as they walk across alyssa's grass to the patio.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{mom says we can build a house.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{hi, mr. nelson.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{hi, alyssa.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{hi, mom.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{good morning.}
<A>__{it's clear that robin is falling in love with her son again.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{alyssa extends her hand to robin and they shake.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{you're so nice to let sam use your shower.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{he's got a standing invitation.}
<A>__{sam instantly flushes red.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{hey, ryan.}
<A>__{sam walks to ryan, who's been standing back from the group.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{sam drapes his arm over ryan's shoulder and together they walk to the foundation.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{so, you wanna build a house?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{if we do, will it stay up?}
<B>__{montage}
<A>__{a blink 182 song blasts from the boom box on the patio table. ryan and adam slather paint remover on five old painted doors. they work with gloves and brushes and appear meticulous in their application. alyssa and sam nail and bolt the corner posts to the rim joist as robin and george work on the stick framed door deck. while george is moving a little slower than usual, it appears that the pain is nearly gone. as the song ends, robin rushes toward the radio.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i brought a few of my own.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{someone stop her!}
<A>__{robin runs to her car and retrieves a few cd's. she slips the cd in and we hear john hiat's "distance." it's a slow, soft song that brings a smile to george's face.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{it's been a while.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{this was my very first slow dance.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{did you know him before you knew dad?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{since seventh grade.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{tell him how you made me fall in love with you.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i smiled at him.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{watch out for the smile, boys.}
<A>__{robin's body moves slightly to the music as she smiles. george grins. the boys aren't sure what to make of the advice. 'you are the beautiful love (my lover), i am the distant shore (so far away). there is so much to uncover (love's hiding). what is this distance for? what is it for?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{who's up for a dance?}
<A>__{robin glances around for any takers, finally focusing on george.}
<C>__{adam }
<D>__{just don't hug me too tight.}
<A>__{adam walks to his mother and they hold hands as they dance. sam sits down to watch. george wears a smile that wipes the last of the pain from his face.}
<C>__{adam }
<D>__{that's all you get. i'm busy today.}
<A>__{adam backs away and grabs his paintbrush. robin stops dancing as she focuses on george.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{let's see if you've gotten any better.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{oh, i'm worse. much, much worse.}
<A>__{robin waits to see how worse. george finally walks to her and takes her in his arms. he must have been better than this. the waltz smooths out as they dance closer, holding tighter. "we fill the air with silent stares. but still, no one there, we are strangers." alyssa decides it's time to go.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i will see you tomorrow.}
<A>__{sam watches alyssa walk away, but he's quickly drawn back to his mother and father dancing. ryan appears anxious, unsure of the music and george.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{when did you fall in love with my dad?}
<A>__{the dance stops. george lets go of robin as she focuses on ryan.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{when i found out i was pregnant with you.}
