<D>__{what about your mom.}
<C>__{andrew }
<D>__{my mom has spinal meningitis, she's she can't work or anything, and the insurance doesn't cover all of her medicine, so a lot of my money has to go into that. i figure if i get enough on camera, maybe i can, i dunno, get custody of her or something.}
