<L>__{interior hoag's surgical bay day}
<A>__{loomis lies still as a surgeon carefully scrapes away charred flesh around his burned ear. the doctor turns to a stereo lithographic machine laser beams attack an organic soup with incredible precision. the light forces a chemical reaction and out of the soup an ear begins to form. it rises from the liquid, now fully formed. the surgeon takes the ear and fits it in place on loomis's head. he starts suturing. observation booth above archer, hoag, brodie and miller watch the operation video enhanced by the two huge screens on the far walls.}
<C>__{hoag}
<D>__{with our new generation of anti inflammatories, healing is accelerated from weeks to days. by his next paycheck, he won't even remember which ear he lost.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{your situation, however, would be a little less permanent...}
<C>__{brodie}
<D>__{ and a lot more classified.}
<A>__{hoag holds up a face sized organic shell made up of yellow cartilage pieces and tendons, etc. archer pulls it over his face like a gauze mask. a "tendon" falls off.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{this'll fool pollux.}
<C>__{hoag}
<D>__{that is a state of the art morpho genetic template. the inside can be built to match the exact shape of your skull; the outside exactly like castor's. then we fit his face right on top }
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{ and you become him.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{you're talking about removing the guy's face?}
<C>__{brodie}
<D>__{borrowing, jon. the procedure's completely reversible.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{one way or the other the mission ends on the eighteenth.}
<A>__{archer turns the shell over and over and over in his hands.}
<C>__{brodie}
<D>__{you know castor better than anyone. you've lived and breathed him for years hell, you even look a little like him.}
<A>__{archer shoves the template back at hoag.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{find yourself another lab rat.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{if you don't do this castor will beat us again. he'll beat you again...}
<A>__{archer pushes his way past them and marches out.}
<C>__{hoag}
<D>__{i don't think that went very well.}
<C>__{brodie}
<D>__{trust us, doc...}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{... he'll jerk around. then he'll be back.}
