<L>__{exterior rooftop on vicki}
<A>__{five stories overhead, vicki has pulled herself up onto the roof of the adjacent building. she watches transfixed as the thugs bend over to remove batman's cowl. but at this height and this angle she can't see his face. on a sudden impulse she reaches for her camera bag.}
<B>__{angle on goons}
<A>__{peering down open mouthed at the unconscious face of bruce wayne. blood seeps from bruce's left nostril.}
<C>__{goon i}
<D>__{well?... who is this guy?}
<C>__{goon ii}
<D>__{i dunno. you seen him before?}
<C>__{goon iii}
<D>__{maybe he's got some kind of i.d.}
<C>__{goon iv}
<D>__{good idea. let's check his wallet.}
<C>__{goon i}
<D>__{we'll worry about it later. plug him.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{in the head.}
<A>__{goon ii draws his automatic. and at that very instant... a}
<B>__{flash gun explodes overhead.}
<A>__{startled, the thugs look up. another camera flash.}
<C>__{goon iii}
<D>__{goddam, it's the redhead!}
<B>__{on vicki}
<A>__{a chunk of ledge chips off mere inches from her head as the goons open fire. she ducks back behind the overhang, holds the camera out over the ledge, and keeps on flashing.}
<B>__{on bruce his eyes wink open. on vicki}
<A>__{momentarily idle. she's used up her roll. the goons keep shooting as she reaches in her bag for new film. she finds it, loads the camera with astonishing dexterity and then, on instinct, reaches back inside the bag for a telephoto lens. all the better to see you with, batman...}
<B>__{on the thugs}
<A>__{no response from vicki. they begin to relax a little.}
<C>__{goon ii}
<D>__{did you hit her?}
<C>__{goon i}
<D>__{who cares? wax that freak.}
<A>__{they turn their attention to bruce. a gloved hand snakes out with lightning speed grabbing goon i by the coattail and pulling him directly into the line of fire. goon ii bas pulled the trigger twice before he knows what's happened. in one fluid motion bruce heaves goon i's lifeless body through the air, knocking goon ii backward over a garbage can. goon ii falls and cracks his head on the nearest wall. goon iii takes a rabbit punch to the throat. he's on the way down when he catches a steel toed boot in the gut. four seconds after all this began, bruce is alone in the alleyway with goon iv. goon iv has his gun pointed right at bruce, but he's shaking too much to pull the trigger. bruce smiles. goon iv screams and runs for his life. through all this, vicki's telephoto camera has been poised on the ledge, snapping away. bruce looks up at the flash gun and shakes his head. he bends to retrieve his cowl.}
<B>__{on vicki}
<A>__{she finally dares to peek down at the alley. limp goons everywhere. and, in addition, the batman leaping up, grabbing the edge of a fire escape, climbing up to meet her. vicki thinks fast. she may have a clean shot of batman's face. she advances the film in the camera and removes the roll, then drops it down her blouse. but batman is likely to want that roll. so she straightens her skirt and scurries across the roof, away from the alley. she should have a minute or so before be gets there. it's a three foot drop to the next roof over. vicki clambers down and quickens her pace, tossing a nervous glance over her shoulder every couple of steps. then, somehow and she'll be damned if she can figure out how she walks smack into the batman. and gasps.}
<C>__{batman}
<D>__{... not even a 'thank you'?}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{well i think you might consider thanking me. you were good as dead.}
<C>__{batman}
<D>__{that's because you lied about your weight.}
<P>__{(a long pause)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{vicki nods and tries to walk past him. he grabs her arm.}
<C>__{batman }
<D>__{i will have to ask you for that film.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{i just wanted to distract them. i wasn't trying to get a picture of you.}
<A>__{batman looks down at the camera hanging from her neck. the telephoto lens must jut out six inches. vicki gulps.}
<C>__{batman}
<D>__{please.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{i won't let you have it.}
<A>__{the batman is amused. he smiles menacingly.}
<C>__{vicki }
<D>__{i know you can break my neck and take it. but the joker's on that same roll. i }
<C>__{batman}
<D>__{the joker is a murderer. and you were as good as dead. so }
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{look, i appreciate what you did for me. but this is my job. and i'm keeping those pictures.}
<C>__{batman}
<D>__{all right, here's a compromise. i will develop the photos. you keep the jokers and i will keep the rest.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{how do i know you won't keep them all?}
<C>__{batman}
<D>__{because i will take you with me.}
<A>__{he reaches out, holds her gently by the shoulders. his voice is deep and soothing. true, vicki is a little dizzy from all that's happened, but she's undeniably drawn to him. still cautious, though. she reaches into her bag and hands over a roll of film. the original roll not the telephoto shots, which are still stashed in her blouse.}
<C>__{batman }
<D>__{thank you, vicki.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{... where are you going to take me?}
<A>__{no reply. she looks up into his mirrored eyes. he pulls her closer to him. brushes back her hair, runs one hand delicately along the line of her cheek... ... and breaks a tiny capsule under her nose. vicki slumps into batman's arms.}
