<L>__{interior mac's suite late night}
<A>__{a small bottle. an ornate label. chateau d'yquem '67. gin lifts it from the table, studies the label. she wears only a man's oversized t shirt. our rotating angle reveals the empty bed, tangled sheets. gin looks pretty rumpled herself. she lifts the bottle, two glasses, a plateful of chocolates and strawberries, and goes to the sliding glass door overlooking... ...the terrace. mac sits on a futon at the balcony railing, overlooking downtown tokyo. he wears a thin japanese robe called a yukata, and is wrapped in half of a huge down coverlet from the bed. the other half obviously waiting for...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{here. a reward.}
<A>__{she curls down into the billowing coverlet, just against his body. sets her things beside him.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{a reward for what?}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{for not being old. after all.}
<A>__{it is a lovely smile. he studies it for a beat.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you mean. not as old as i look.}
<A>__{she traces her finger along his cheek.}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{yeh.}
<A>__{and kisses him. it takes awhile. she seems to enjoy it. with him, it's harder to tell. when she pulls back... ...he picks up a chocolate. tears it in half. offers her the larger piece.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{do i deserve a reward?}
<A>__{no answer. he puts the chocolate into her mouth. with great tenderness, he traces the line of her lower lip. as she swallows.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{it's so hard to find good casual sex, anymore. i'm probably out of practice.}
<A>__{but he just looks at her.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{what's hard to find. is someone you truly want to be with.}
<A>__{and leans closer. just above a whisper...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{even for awhile.}
<A>__{he kisses her. beautiful and deep, the way he does it. and when he pulls back, she is staring at him. as if at a loss for something to say.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{it's lucky we stopped by my room, for the wine.}
<A>__{she swallows. because his gaze is unrelenting. as if not forgetting that she's changed the subject.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{otherwise, we'd never have found my bag was stolen. until tomorrow.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{would that make it more stolen?}
<A>__{she smiles. his face looks kind now, not formidable at all. maybe she's wondering if she actually likes him.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{they even got my prescriptions.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{something you need? there are all night chemists...}
<A>__{he does look concerned. and therefore sweet. she kisses his nose.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{i take prilosec. for stomach acid. and an inhaler. for asthma.}
<A>__{she gets her old smile. the soft, wicked tease.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{but since i didn't have to work all that hard tonight...}
<A>__{he stares at her. cocks a finger, like a gun, right between her eyes. pantomimes pulling the trigger.}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{ouch. i had that coming.}
<A>__{she pivots, and snuggles her back comfortably into his chest. he wraps strong arms around her. pulling her close.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{why would someone steal my luggage? every guest in this place must have more than a wannabe art dealer.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{ah. maybe the thief thought you had something valuable in there.}
<A>__{something in the tone.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{such as...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{well. wannabe dealers make excellent fences.}
<A>__{a flicker. in her eyes. and she cuddles back. as if enjoying the humor.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{he thought i had a stolen painting. in my bag.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{i'm joking, of course.}
<A>__{kisses the top of her head.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{the vermeer wouldn't fit.}
<A>__{her eyes widen. just a little.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{why, did you do something wrong?}
<A>__{she turns all the way around. their faces are inches apart. each reading the other's eyes.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{you said. vermeer.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{the most famous painting stolen this week.}
<A>__{his turn. to kiss her nose.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{if you don't keep up on your craft. you'll miss all the jokes.}
<A>__{and lowers her gently onto her back. still staring in her eyes, he winds her legs around him. her mouth parts, but... ...he fills it with his own. this conversation. is over.}
