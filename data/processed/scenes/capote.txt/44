<D>__{danny?}
<P>__{(danny stops)}
<D>__{would you mind terribly if i walked with you for a bit?}

<A>__{nelle and laura kinney sit at the table. truman stands at the counter.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i thought you were from the fbi with your long coat.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{is that so?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{that's why i ran off.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{i've been getting a lot of that lately.}
<A>__{truman smiles. laura smiles back, amused, a bit comforted.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{it's fine talking to you all. practically nobody around here wants to talk since what happened.}
<C>__{nelle}
<D>__{folks have been through a rough patch. including you.}
<P>__{(laura nods)}
<D>__{nancy was your best friend.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{she was my best friend.}
<A>__{they're quiet for a few moments.}
<C>__{nelle}
<D>__{how has danny been?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{pretty shattered. nothing terrible ever happened to him before. nancy just started wearing his ring again after this huge fight mr. clutter was trying to get her to end it 'cause danny's catholic.}
<C>__{nelle}
<D>__{what were the clutters?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{methodist. danny was the last person at the house that night. that's why mr. dewey's keeps interviewing him they don't think he had anything to do with it just to see if he remembers anything unusual and all.}
<C>__{nelle}
<D>__{people in town seem to wonder if he was involved.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{that's been real hard for danny.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{oh, it's the hardest when people have a notion about you and it's impossible to convince them otherwise. since i was a child folks have thought they had me pegged because of the way i look and the way i talk. they're always wrong.}
<P>__{(looks at her)}
<D>__{do you know what i mean?}
<A>__{laura stares at him and nods. he's clearly struck a chord.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i want to show you something.}
<A>__{she goes in the door to the ground floor apartment. they see her through the lace curtains getting something from her desk, which is stacked with books. truman whispers to nelle:}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{not one person here understands her.}
<A>__{laura returns. she hugs a small book to her chest. after a moment, she holds it out to them.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{maybe you'll get a better picture of nancy. and the family.}
<C>__{nelle}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{it's her diary.}
