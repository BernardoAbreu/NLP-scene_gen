<A>__{szpilman, keeping to the shadows of the alleyway, watches the front of the building. comings and goings. german soldiers in evidence. the mob is smaller now. szpilman waits and watches, and then a poor woman passes, carrying a can wrapped in newspaper followed by a ragged old man, dragging himself along. he's shivering with cold, his shoes with holes show his purple feet. the ragged old man suddenly lunges forward and tries to grab the can from the poor woman. they struggle desperately.}
<C>__{poor woman}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{a snatcher! help me, a snatcher!}
<A>__{the can falls to the pavement and thick, steaming soup pours into the dirty street. szpilman watches, rooted to the spot. the ragged old man stares at the can, lets out a groan, more like a whimper, and throws himself full length in the slush, licking the soup up from the pavement. the poor woman starts to howl, kicking the old man and tearing at her hair in despair. then:}
<C>__{rubinstein's voice}
<D>__{boys, keep your peckers up! and girls, keep your legs crossed!}
<A>__{rubinstein, a ragged, dishevelled little man, chaplinesque, waving a stick, hopping and jumping, approaches the germans outside the bureau.}
<C>__{rubinstein}
<D>__{don't let 'em get you down }
<A>__{he approaches a couple of shupos.}
<C>__{rubinstein}
<D>__{bandits! crooks! thieves!}
<A>__{he waves his stick at them. they laugh. one of them bows low.}
<D>__{1st shupo good day, herr rubinstein.}
<C>__{rubinstein}
<D>__{if that means good day, i'm your man, you gangsters, robbers, pirates! 2nd shupo}
<P>__{(tapping his head)}
<D>__{mad!}
<C>__{rubinstein}
<D>__{ich bin meshuge, you bandit!}
<A>__{almost in tears with laughter, they give him a cigarette and he goes on his way. szpilman almost smiles, then looks again at the building. he waits.}
