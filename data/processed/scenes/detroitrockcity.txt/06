<L>__{interior jam's bedroom day}
<A>__{the sun's early morning rays beam through the kiss "destroyer" poster taped onto a window shade. the phone rings. jam bolts upright, his profile blocking the poster. he has just awakened under the only other decoration in his room: a crucifix. still dressed in last night's clothes, a plain black tee shirt and blue jeans, jam leaps out of bed unwittingly planting a foot in the handle of a bullworker (a piece of exercise equipment comprised of a powerful spring with two handles on either end) whose other handle is stuck under one of the bed's legs. jam runs to a phone on his dresser, drawing the bullworker's powerful springs out to maximum tension. no sooner does he pick up, when he is yanked to the floor and dragged across it as if tied to the bumper of a speeding car. despite the bullworker pulling him back toward his bed, jam does manage to get the phone to his ear.}

<D>__{hello?}
<A>__{the phone's cord stretches taut causing its cradle to leap from the dresser and whack jam on the head.}
