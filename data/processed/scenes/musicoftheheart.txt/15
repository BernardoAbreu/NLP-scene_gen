<A>__{janet smiles at the boys, but clearly thinks roberta's a little off. roberta holds her hand out to dennis.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{roberta guaspari demetras.}
<A>__{dennis shakes her hand, regarding her warily.}
<C>__{janet}
<D>__{this is dennis rausch, our music teacher and program coordinator.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{mrs. demetras, didn't i make things clear yesterday?}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{if i could just show you something it'll only take a minute.}
<A>__{before janet can answer, roberta and the kids quickly take out their violins and get into position. janet and dennis exchange a look.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{are we having a talent show? i should have brought my tap shoes.}
<A>__{roberta ignores the jab, then nods to the boys. the three of them begin an incredibly impressive violin trio, playing an etude in three part harmony. for the first measures, janet's still annoyed by the intrusion, but she's quickly won over. dennis watches impassively. roberta and the boys finish their piece; janet applauds and dennis joins in to be polite. the three take bows. a beat.}
<C>__{lexi}
<D>__{will you hire her now?}
<A>__{janet laughs, then gestures for them to sit.}

<C>__{janet}
<D>__{your mom must be a good teacher.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{she's o.k.}
<A>__{roberta gives nick a look, but janet smiles.}
<C>__{janet}
<P>__{(to roberta)}
<D>__{if you could teach our students to play like that, i'd be thrilled, but }
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{i can. any child can learn the violin.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{assuming they had the discipline.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{i will teach them to have discipline.}
<C>__{janet}
<D>__{a lot of our parents are struggling to feed their kids and pay the rent they don't have time to help them learn violin.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{they don't have to. if they can help, great but these kids will be committed. they'll practice on their own, they'll help each other in the classroom }
<A>__{dennis laughs. roberta looks at him, a bit miffed.}
<C>__{dennis}
<P>__{(with an edge)}
<D>__{i think i know these students, miss demetras. their attention span doesn't go past do re mi. maybe on a good day, i can get them to "fa."}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{you're underestimating them. they can play as well as any other kids.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{that i'd like to see.}

<D>__{you will.}
<A>__{a beat. janet observes the tension, then turns to roberta.}
<C>__{janet}

<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{that's o.k. i will worry about that later.}
<P>__{(with a grateful look)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{we see relief and fear in roberta's face.}
<C>__{dennis}
<P>__{(to janet)}
<D>__{well, i've already planned out the whole term, and i can tell you right now, there's no room for this! besides, where you gonna find money for violins?}
