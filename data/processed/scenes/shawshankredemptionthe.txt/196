<P>__{(no answer)}
<D>__{don't make me come down there now! i will thump your skull for you!}
<A>__{still no answer. glaring, haig stalks down the tier, clipboard in hand. his men fall in behind.}

<C>__{haig}
<A>__{oh my holy god.}
<B>__{reverse angle}
<A>__{reveals the cell is empty. everything neat and tidy. even the bunk is stowed. they wrench the door open and rush in, tossing the cell in a panic as if andy might be lurking under the kleenex or the toothpaste. camera rockets in on haig as he spins toward us, bellowing at the top of his lungs:}
<C>__{haig}
<D>__{what the fuck!}
