<A>__{as albert comes out the men have gathered. there's a strange sense of optimism, for such a gloomy moment. the geordie comes up to albert and hands him a sheaf of pound notes.}

<D>__{the major put in ten.}
<A>__{the geordie flashes a sly wink.}
<C>__{geordie }
<D>__{mum's the word where the major's concerned. your friend on the crutches over there }
<A>__{he turns to indicate david lyons, who nods at albert solemnly.}
<C>__{geordie }
<D>__{ even asked the major to say that joey was his, an officer's horse, so that he could go back with the others.}
<A>__{albert is amazed. he is about to show his gratitude when the sergeant major shouts:}
<C>__{sergeant fry}
<D>__{come on, narracott! get a move on. we don't want to miss the show.}
<A>__{albert snaps to attention and begins to lead joey out of the parade ground with the other horses. as they walk off, the sergeant silently adds some of his own money to the notes in albert's hand.}
