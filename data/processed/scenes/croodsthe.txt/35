<L>__{exterior grasslands afternoon}
<A>__{guy lays a snare in the low grass. he walks to the base of a rotund, spikey tree, unwinding more rope as he goes. he ties the rope around the base of the tree. then he hands the loose end to eep. belt stretches his arms wide. guy stops jumping and points up to the top of the tree. eep takes the cue. she leaps up and grabs the leaning top of the tree. her weight gently bends the tree top down to the ground.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{guy carefully sets the trigger.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{what do you call this?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{a trap.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{what does it do?}
<A>__{guy makes sound effects to get his point across as he describes the trap.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(explains with sounds)}
<D>__{soft whistle raargh, thump thump thump, thubububububub soft whistle poom! tadaaaaaa!}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{how long have you been alone?}
<A>__{belt opens his arms wide showing guy has been alone a long, long time.}
<C>__{eep }
<D>__{... so what do we do?}
<A>__{guy pulls out a weird miniature turkey fish puppet.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{how's your acting?}
<A>__{on the turkey fish getting ready to eat the trip gerbils. the turkey lifts the creature to his mouth to devour it, but he's interrupted by a whistling sound. he turns to see the silly little puppet dancing about. the turkey fish drops his meal and cautiously approaches the puppet. on guy and eep working the puppet. eep is having the time of her life.}
<C>__{guy }
<D>__{oh, you're good at this.}
<A>__{they are so into what they are doing, they accidentally get tangled up.}
<C>__{guy }
<D>__{oh, sorry, i...}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{just move your arm... no, your other arm. oh, that one's mine.}
<A>__{in their struggle to untangle themselves, eep and guy inadvertently insult the turkey fish. it charges. eep and guy don't notice. the turkey fish misses the snare, leaps the rock and snatches the fake bird off of guy's head, thrashing it.}
<C>__{eep }
<D>__{uh... it didn't step in your trap y, thing.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{yeah, i noticed.}
<A>__{eep boldly stands in front of the bird. the turkey fish grabs guy and tosses him high across the open field. he goes flying through the air, screaming. on grug hearing the commotion. guy lands back in the log.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{where's eep?}
<A>__{eep is in full parkour as she runs from the turkeyfish.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{she's awesome.}
<A>__{grug steps forward. he's going to spring the trap.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{eep!}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{dad, no!}
<A>__{she leaps the snare, pushing grug down. the turkey fish hits the trigger. the snare trips. the bird bites at the cavemen, but comes up short. the turkey fish whooshes backwards into the air. he flies a couple hundred feet up... ... and crashes down in a cloud of feathers.}
