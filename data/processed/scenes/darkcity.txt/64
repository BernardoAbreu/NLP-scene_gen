<D>__{keep him away: he's insane.}
<A>__{the guard just smiles, looks at the doctor knowingly.}

<C>__{white }
<D>__{what do you want?}

<C>__{miss crenshaw}
<D>__{yes. an "h".}
<A>__{the inspector looks up from the speaker. his p.o.v. through the mirror, white seems to have calmed down.}
<B>__{back in the visiting room}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{the men in black they're the killers.}
<A>__{white stands abruptly, pushes himself against the glass.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{you're a liar!}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{no, it's the truth.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{so you're telling me the truth this time? is that it!}
<A>__{the doctor removes a small syringe from his black bag, places it on the table in front of the glass, blocks it from the guard's view.}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{if you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{not that again...}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{everyone get's one very much like this...}
<P>__{(points to syringe)}
<D>__{but this one's special. it will help you understand, everything...}
<C>__{white }
<D>__{i'm not injecting anything into my brain.}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{anton i mean, john, there has been an experiment, a dangerous experiment. i arranged it. it was a lie from the beginning. it almost worked, but things did not go as they should have. you have been left blank.}
<A>__{schreber waves frantically at the air surrounding him.}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{you can change this, all this.}
<P>__{(points at syringe again)}
<D>__{but you must take it.}
<A>__{white stares blankly at him for a moment, then:}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{you've been working too hard.}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{please! don't be foolish! time is short. let me show you something. look at this syringe.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{don't ask stupid questions. look at it.}
<A>__{white reluctantly does this.}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{concentrate. imagine the syringe rising. picture it floating above the table.}
<B>__{tight on white}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{do it!}
<A>__{white's p.o.v. the syringe starts to vibrate, actually rises into the air floats stationary between white and schreber.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{it's a trick.}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{no it isn't. you are doing it! now raise it over the glass and...}
<A>__{suddenly the syringe spins towards the doctor, impales itself in his shoulder. he yelps, grabs it.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{oh, sorry...}
<A>__{the doctor pulls out the syringe, is about to say more when a}
<B>__{buzzer sounds.}
<C>__{mechanical voice}
<D>__{your time is up.}
<A>__{schreber looks to where the voice came from a speaker above their heads.}
<C>__{schreber }
<D>__{i gave you your chance, now it's too late. they'll learn you are here soon. it's all over.}
