<A>__{we follow with finch. we see stifler down the hall, holding open the bathroom door like a pleasant doorman.}

<D>__{this way, sit.}

<A>__{finch leaps into a stall and slams the door behind him.}
<L>__{interior east great falls high bathroom stall day}
<A>__{finch has stopped. he's staring down at the toilet. it looks entirely uninviting. but he's straining, struggling, starting to dance around, moaning as he cramps up. he grabs a length of toilet paper and lines the seat with it. then another, and another. sweat drips off his forehead.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{come on come on come on...}
<A>__{he's got the seat lined with at least three layers of toilet paper. notices a spot where there's still bare toilet seat. he tears off one square of toilet paper, placing it on the spot. he steps back and looks it over, still wriggling to contain his bowels.}
<C>__{finch }
<D>__{okay. you can do this.}
<A>__{he unbuckles his pants. sits down just as we hear someone enter the bathroom. finch, still restraining, listens for a moment...only to hear the click click click of heels.}
