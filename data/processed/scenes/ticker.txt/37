<L>__{interior bowling alley pool room bar later}
<A>__{the music is more redneck rock, the crowd as well. glass and t.j. are in the midst of game of pool, nursing bottles of root beer. they continue to play while eyeing those coming and going. reilly enters from the alley, catches glass' eye and shakes his head. he goes to the bar and orders a coke. he takes the drink and moves over next to glass as t.j. lines up a shot.}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{how long are we going to stay?}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{`til we get a better lead.}
<A>__{reilly's attention is drawn to a crowded booth in the corner where a few bowling alley girls block the view of the entire booth. glass nudges reilly, they look over to see pooch entering the bar. he sees them and moves to the bar. t.j. sinks his shot and lines up another as reilly and glass move to meet pooch. pooch produces a printout from his jacket, opens it up.}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{unsolved bombings in the last year... boston, new york, philadelphia... but no real match}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{insurance?}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{political.}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{exactly my thinking. except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns. they seem to be just unrelated industrial companies. some insured, some not.}
<C>__{pooch }
<D>__{but there's traces of c4 and assorted inflammatory additives found in each case. the only common denominator is the detonators all had circuitry consistent with our micro chip.}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{not bad for bomb squad, eh?}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{what not bad. you've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{i got a friend over at scotland yard who's gonna try and reach out to a undercover guy who would know if any of the rightwingers are circulating over here. bev's following up on the briefcase manufacturers, too.}
<A>__{t.j. comes over.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{pooch, you're up. rack `em.}
<A>__{they look over to the pool table to see only the cue ball left.}
<C>__{t.j. }
<D>__{boss, you're buying the next round.}
<A>__{t.j. sets his empty root beer bottle on the bar.}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{how're you guys doing?}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{still waiting for a miracle. go ahead.}
<A>__{pooch and t.j. head back to the pool table where two comely gals have begun putting the balls back onto the table. t.j. turns on his smile and chats them up.}
<C>__{reilly }
<D>__{quite a team you've got, where'd you find them?}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{it's a small fraternity, everyone knows everyone. i'm always recruiting. pooch is ex d.o.d., military expert... claymores, grenades. he played linebacker at boston college, worked a k 9 unit that led him to the bomb squad... great nose, lousy fingers, we try to keep him away from the tickers. t.j. is a heck of chemist, texas a&m engineering degree. found him in a militia chat room turns out we were both monitoring the same groups. bev is the natural born hacker, we stole her from dispatch. she had the cave reorganized and ultra high tech in two months. captain has no idea how much hardware she's "found" for us.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{you guys seem pretty tight.}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{we've gotta be. in this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{why do you do it?}
<C>__{glass}
<D>__{i don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. see, when you beat one of these things...}
<C>__{glass }
<D>__{there's that one second when you realize you saw something you weren't supposed to see... this beautiful naked woman... death... and then the rush comes, the high, cuz you realize you got away with it.}
<A>__{t.j. returns, shrugs.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{lesbians.}
<A>__{pooch is still with the girls, showing one of them how to line up a shot.}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{looks like pooch's doing okay.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{he's married, he don't even know what a lesbian is.}
<A>__{t.j. waves over the bartender. he and glass orders fresh drinks as reilly eyes pretty blonde across the bar. she picks up two beers and grabs a pack of matches off the bar. she turns and moves to the booth in the corner. the bodies part and reilly catches a glimpse of earring. reilly nearly chokes on his coke as earring takes the matches from the blonde. earring checks his watches, rises. he looks up and catches reilly's eye he smiles then bolts. reilly coughs up his drink and tries to get a word out, pointing as earring slips out the exit door next to the booth. glass pats reilly's back as he gags, eyes blazing. finally...}
<C>__{reilly}
<D>__{there he goes. he was here the whole time.}
<A>__{reilly pushes his way through the crowd with glass on his heels. t.j. rushes over and grabs pooch away from the girls at the pool table. reilly runs into a pair of enormous rednecks, spilling their beer on them. the rednecks grab him by the collar and prepare to fight as pooch arrives and body blocks the rednecks away from reilly. reilly is released and he continues after earring as pooch and the rednecks mix it up. a brawl breaks out with pooch and t.j. in the middle as reilly and glass make it to the exit door. reilly flies out but glass freezes dead in his tracks. he spins back to look at the corner booth. the shopping bag sits on the floor under the table. glass tenses. the fight escalates quickly, but pooch employs his linebacker skills and cuts down his assailant... and t.j. a natural streetfighting rabbit puncher. they quickly dispatch the rednecks, leaving them bruised and bloodied... they rush for glass and the doorway then lock on glass' reaction and stop.}
