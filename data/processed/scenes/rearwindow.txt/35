<A>__{he is now looking at the windows of the apartments nearest to him. a shade has gone up, and a man, obviously a caretaker is raising a window with some effort. having accomplished this, he turns back into the room, and we now see him approach a young man and woman who are standing just inside the doorway. he hands a key to the young man, and then obligingly brings in two suitcases which he places on the floor beside them. he gives them a studied, but agreeable nod, then departs. we now see that the girl has a small hat with a veil, and an ornate corsage pinned to her light blue tailored suit. the boy, who like the girl is perhaps twenty years old, wears a dark blue serge suit and a grey felt hat. he takes off the hat, and scales it over to a nearby chair. quickly they are in each other's arms, kissing passionately, crushing the girl's corsage and pushing her hat back a little. they part, the boy laughs nervously, and takes a furtive glance out toward the corridor. he looks back into the room, and beckons her to come out. she follows him wonderingly. for a moment, both are lost from sight. when they reappear, he is carrying her in his arms, over the threshold. he sets her down, closes the door, and they kiss again. they part, still holding hands and looking into each other's eyes. then slowly, and significantly, she looks toward the open window. he releases her hands, goes to the window and pull down the shade, as she is reaching upward with both hands to unpin her hat.}
