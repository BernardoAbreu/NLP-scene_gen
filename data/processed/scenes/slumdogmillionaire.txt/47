<L>__{exterior mumbai street. night.}
<A>__{jamal is studying a piece of paper and reading out numbers from it. there is something not quite right about jamal perhaps the fact that there are two feet by his ears. salim is standing on his shoulders and spraying the numbers on a wall with an aerosol and a certain lack of confidence.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{four, nine, zero, nine the one with the stick going down, salim six stick going up }
<A>__{latika's head appears from around the corner.}
<C>__{latika}
<P>__{(whispered)}
<D>__{oi!}
<A>__{but they don't hear. then she is running for her life past the pair of them.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{six, one, shit, let's go }
<A>__{salim collapses off jamal's shoulders and all three run off down an alley past a dozen of the gang's sprayed on adverts all reading: "beanbags 989 4909661". a fat security guard with a long stick huffs round the corner. chases them up an alley. nowhere to go except through an imposing gate that clearly leads to a private house.}
<C>__{security guard}
<D>__{got you now, little shits.}
