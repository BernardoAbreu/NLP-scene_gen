<L>__{interior fair oaks high school counsellor's office day}
<A>__{the school counsellor flips through papers in a file.}
<C>__{counsellor}
<D>__{look, tj. i know you've been through a lot and it's gonna take time to readjust, but as you know, the school can't tolerate this kind of behavior.}
<C>__{counsellor }
<D>__{i'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt this time, but you can't be starting fights.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{i didn't start anything. he pushed me.}
<C>__{counsellor}
<D>__{what he did or didn't do isn't important. what's important is what you do, and how you react. do you understand?}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{not really.}
<C>__{counsellor}
<D>__{which part don't you understand?}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{i don't understand the part about how it's not important that he pushed me and he punched me and he kicked me and he told me to suck his cock and now i'm the bad guy sitting in the office.}
<A>__{the counsellor cuts him off.}
<C>__{counsellor}
<D>__{hey, hey, hey. i do not wanna hear that kind of language in my office.}

<C>__{counsellor}
<D>__{listen, i'm gonna cut you some slack, but you're gonna have to meet me halfway here.}
<A>__{tj shakes his head. he gives up on this conversation. he looks out the window. hesher is out there smoking and watching. tj is suddenly unnerved.}
<C>__{counsellor }
<D>__{i should really be suspending you, but i won't if you can promise me you'll put in a real effort...}
<P>__{(noticing tj looking elsewhere)}
