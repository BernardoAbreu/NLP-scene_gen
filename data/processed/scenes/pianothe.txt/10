<D>__{here papa!}
<A>__{ada's face pales in the diminishing light. exasperated by the threatened incarceration she shakes her head with anguish and moving to the piano lifts the lid and plays several bars brutally and strongly. she passes on to the bedroom, where she picks up the small hand mirror and looks at her face puckered with frustration. she touches her face and neck tenderly, then throws herself on the bed, face to the wall, her hands over her ears. flora stands over her mother.}

<A>__{ada rolls over, her eyes closed she pushes her face and body against the mattress. the movement is sensual and removed. flora stops dealing the cards on to the bed and watches her mother puzzled. sc 100int stewart's hut night sc 100 it is night and ada is walking in the dark, ghostly in her white nightgown. she sits at her piano and begins to play loudly and strongly. her hair is loose and she seems half asleep. flora and stewart wake to the loud playing and fumble their way to the kitchen. stewart carries a lit candle. ada continues her playing flora passes a hand in front of ada's face.}
