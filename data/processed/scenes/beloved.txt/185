<L>__{interior the shed }
<A>__{the nephew opens the door. the four men enter.... howard and bulgar are bleeding in the sawdust, unconscious a bloody shovel lays near them. sethe is holding a blood soaked little girl (beloved) to her chest with one hand...and denver by the heels of the other. she is swinging denver toward the wall planks, misses then tries again... when out of nowhere, stamp paid rushes by the horrified white men and grabs denver out of sethe's hand before she can swing her a second time... stillness. schoolteacher looks at the carnage...a bloody saw lies at sethe's feet, the weapon she used on her own child's throat. the nephew is paralyzed...horrified.}
<C>__{nephew}
<D>__{what she go and do that for?...what she go and do that for?}
<A>__{baby suggs walks in. whatever amount of god's grace she could imagine and will into being, vanishes with one look into that shed.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{you all better go on.}
<P>__{(to schoolteacher)}
<D>__{nothing here to claim, i guess. look like your business is over. mine's started.}
<A>__{schoolteacher beats his hat against his thigh and spits in the shed before exiting, followed by the catcher and the nephew. the sheriff speaks to sethe.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{i will have to take you in. no trouble now. you've done enough to last you....}
<A>__{sethe doesn't move.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{you come quiet, here, and i won't have to tie you up.}
<A>__{meanwhile, baby suggs notices who breathes and who does not and moves straight to the boys.... stamp paid extends his arm to sethe.}
<C>__{stamp paid}
<D>__{sethe. you take my arm and gimme yours.}
<A>__{sethe turns to him, the first time she's looked into anyone's eyes and sees denver in his arms...a sound escapes from her throat as though she'd made a mistake.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{i'm going out here and send for a wagon.}
<A>__{he exits. baby suggs rubs the boys' hands, tries to raise their eyelids, spits on her dress and wipes away the blood as they slowly regain a dazed consciousness..she whispers;}
<C>__{baby suggs}
<D>__{i beg you pardon..i beg your pardon..}
