<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Spike!}
<ACTION>__{The house has far too many things in it.  Definitely two- bachelor flat. Spike appears.  An unusual looking fellow.  He has unusual hair, unusual facial hair and an unusual Welsh accent: very white, as though his flesh has never seen the sun.  He wears only shorts.}

<DIAL>__{Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{SPIKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well... wait for it...}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(He pulls on a t-shirt)}
<DIAL>__{First there's this one...}
<ACTION>__{The t-shirt is white with a horrible looking plastic alien coming out of it, jaws open, blood everywhere.  It says 'I Love Blood.'}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.}
<CHAR>__{SPIKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Point taken.}
<ACTION>__{He heads back up the stairs... talks as he changes...}
<CHAR>__{SPIKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{SPIKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Cool, huh?}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.}
<CHAR>__{SPIKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Wouldn't want that...}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(and back up he goes)}
<DIAL>__{Okay -- just one more.}
<ACTION>__{He comes down wearing it.  Lots of hearts, saying, 'You're the most beautiful woman in the world.'}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.}
<CHAR>__{SPIKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{WILLIAM } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{And so it was just another hopeless Wednesday, as I set off through the market to work, little suspecting that this was the day which would change my life forever.  This is work, by the way, my little travel book shop...}
<ACTION>__{A small unpretentious store... named 'The Travel Book Co.'}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{... which, well, sells travel books -- and, to be frank with you, doesn't always sell many of those.}
<ACTION>__{William enters.}
<LOC>__{INT. THE BOOKSHOP - DAY}
<ACTION>__{It is a small shop, slightly chaotic, bookshelves everywhere, with little secret bits round corners with even more books. Martin, William's sole employee, is waiting enthusiastically. He is very keen, an uncrushable optimist.  Perhaps without cause.  A few seconds later, William stands gloomily behind the desk.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Classic.  Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus $B!r(J347.}
<CHAR>__{MARTIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes, better get me a half.  All I can afford.}
<CHAR>__{MARIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I get your logic.  Demi-capu coming up.}
<ACTION>__{He salutes and bolts out the door -- as he does, a woman walks in. We only just glimpse her. Cut to William working.  He looks up casually.  And sees something.  His reaction is hard to read.  After a pause...}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Can I help you?}
<ACTION>__{It is Anna Scott, the biggest movie star in the world -- here -- in his shop.  The most divine, subtle, beautiful woman on earth. When she speaks she is very self-assured and self-contained.}
<CHAR>__{ANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No, thanks.  I'll just look around.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Fine.}
<ACTION>__{She wanders over to a shelf as he watches her -- and picks out a quite smart coffee table book.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying.  You'd be wasting your money.}
<CHAR>__{ANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Really?}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes.  This one though is... very good.}
<ACTION>__{He picks up a book on the counter.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps. There's also a very amusing incident with a kebab.}
<CHAR>__{ANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thanks.  I'll think about it.}
<ACTION>__{William suddenly spies something odd on the small TV monitor beside him.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{If you could just give me a second.}
<ACTION>__{Her eyes follow him as he moves toward the back of the shop and approaches a man in slightly ill-fitting clothes.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Excuse me.}
<CHAR>__{THIEF} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Bad news.}
<CHAR>__{THIEF} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What?}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.}
<CHAR>__{THIEF} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{So?}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.}
<CHAR>__{THIEF} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What book?}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The one down your trousers.}
<CHAR>__{THIEF} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I haven't got a book down my trousers.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,  what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.}
<CHAR>__{THIEF} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, ideally, when I went back to the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan guide to Bali from your trousers, and either wipe it and put it back, or buy it.  See you in a sec.}
<ACTION>__{He returns to his desk.  In the monitor we just glimpse, as does William, the book coming out of the trousers and put back on the shelves.  The thief drifts out towards the door.  Anna, who has observed all this, is looking at a blue book on the counter.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sorry about that...}
<CHAR>__{ANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes, we couldn't stop him.  If you can find an unsigned copy, it's worth an absolute fortune.}
<ACTION>__{She smiles.  Suddenly the thief is there.}
<CHAR>__{THIEF} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Excuse me.}
<CHAR>__{ANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes.}
<CHAR>__{THIEF} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Can I have your autograph?}
<CHAR>__{ANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What's your name?}
<CHAR>__{THIEF} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Rufus.}
<ACTION>__{She signs his scruffy piece of paper.  He tries to read it.}
<CHAR>__{THIEF} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What does it say?}
<CHAR>__{ANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'}
<CHAR>__{THIEF} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Nice one.  Would you like my phone number?}
<CHAR>__{ANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Tempting but... no, thank you.}
<ACTION>__{Thief leaves.}
<CHAR>__{ANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I think I will try this one.}
<ACTION>__{She hands William a $B!r(J20 note and the book he said was rubbish. He talks as he handles the transaction.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh -- right -- on second thoughts maybe it wasn't that bad.  Actually -- it's a sort of masterpiece really. None of those childish kebab stories you get in so many travel books these days.  And I'll throw in one of these for free.}
<ACTION>__{He drops in one of the signed books.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Very useful for lighting fires, wrapping fish, that sort of things.}
<ACTION>__{She looks at him with a slight smile.}
<CHAR>__{ANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thanks.}
<ACTION>__{And leaves.  She's out of his life forever.  William is a little dazed.  Seconds later Martin comes back in.}
<CHAR>__{MARTIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Cappuccino as ordered.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.}
<CHAR>__{MARTIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Who?  Someone famous?}
<ACTION>__{But William's innate natural English discretion takes over.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No. No-one -- no-one.}
<ACTION>__{They set about drinking their coffees.}
<CHAR>__{MARTIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Would be exciting if someone famous did come into the shop though, wouldn't it?  Do you know -- this is pretty incredible actually -- I once saw Ringo Starr.  Or at least I think it was Ringo.  It might have been that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof,' Toppy.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Topol.}
<CHAR>__{MARTIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's right -- Topol.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.}
<CHAR>__{MARTIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No, well... he was quite a long way away.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{So it could have been neither of them?}
<CHAR>__{MARTIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I suppose so.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?}
<CHAR>__{MARTIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Not classic, no.}
<ACTION>__{Martin shakes his head.  William drains his cappuccino.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Right -- want another one?}
<CHAR>__{MARTIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice.}
<LOC>__{EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY}
<ACTION>__{William sets off.}
<LOC>__{INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY}
<ACTION>__{William collects his juice in a coffee shop on Westbourne Park Road.}
<LOC>__{EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY}
<ACTION>__{William swings out of the little shop -- he turns the corner of Portobello Road and bumps straight into Anna.  The orange juice,  in its foam cup, flies.  It soaks Anna.}
<CHAR>__{ANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh Jesus.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Here, let me help.}
<ACTION>__{He grabs some paper napkins and starts to clean it off -- getting far too near her breasts in the panic of it...}
<CHAR>__{ANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What are you doing?!}
<ACTION>__{He jumps back.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up.}
<CHAR>__{ANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No thank you.  I need to get my car back.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I also have a phone.  I'm confident that in five minutes we can have you spick and span and back on the street again... in the non-prostitute sense obviously.}
<ACTION>__{In his diffident way, he is confident, despite her being genuinely annoyed.  She turns and looks at him.}
<CHAR>__{ANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Eighteen yards.  That's my house there.}
<ACTION>__{He doesn't lie -- it is eighteen yards away.  She looks down. She looks up at him.}
<LOC>__{INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - CORRIDOR - DAY}
<ACTION>__{They enter.  She carries a few stylish bags.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Come on in.  I'll just...}
<ACTION>__{William runs in further -- it's a mess.  He kicks some old shoes under the stairs, bins an unfinished pizza and hides a plate of breakfast in a cupboard.  She enters the kitchen.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's not that tidy, I fear.}
<ACTION>__{And he guides her up the stairs, after taking the bag of books from her...}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The bathroom is right at the top of the stairs and there's a phone on the desk up there.}
<ACTION>__{She heads upstairs.}
<LOC>__{INT. KITCHEN - DAY}
<ACTION>__{William is tidying up frantically.  Then he hears Anna's feet on the stairs.  She walks down, wearing a short, sparkling black top beneath her leather jacket.  With her trainers still on.  He is dazzled by the sight of her.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Would you like a cup of tea before you go?}
<CHAR>__{ANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No thanks.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Coffee?}
<CHAR>__{ANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Orange juice -- probably not.}
<ACTION>__{He moves to his very empty fridge -- and offers its only contents.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest?}
<CHAR>__{ANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Really, no.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.}
<CHAR>__{ANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Do you always say 'no' to everything?}
<ACTION>__{Pause.  She looks at him deep.}
<CHAR>__{ANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(pause)}
<DIAL>__{I better be going.  Thanks for your help.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.}
<ACTION>__{It has taken a lot to get this out loud.  He is not a smooth- talking man.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Take my one chance to say it.  After you've read that terrible book, you're certainly not going to be coming back to the shop.}
<ACTION>__{She smiles.  She's cool.}
<CHAR>__{ANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thank you.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.}
<ACTION>__{He guides her towards the door.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Nice to meet you.  Surreal but nice.}
<ACTION>__{In a slightly awkward moment, he shows her out the door.  He closes the door and shakes his head in wonder.  Then...}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{'Surreal but nice.'  What was I thinking?}
<ACTION>__{... He  shakes his head again in horror and wanders back along the corridor in silence.  There's a knock on the door.  He moves back, casually...}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Coming.}
<ACTION>__{He opens the door.  It's her.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh hi.  Forget something?}
<CHAR>__{ANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I forgot my bag.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh right.}
<ACTION>__{He shoots into the kitchen and picks up the forgotten shopping bag.  Then returns and hands it to her.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Here we go.}
<CHAR>__{ANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thanks.  Well...}
<ACTION>__{They stand in that corridor -- in that small space.  Second time saying goodbye.  A strange feeling of intimacy.  She leans forward and she kisses him.  Total silence.  A real sense of the strangeness of those lips, those famous lips on his.  They part.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  Disaster...}
<CHAR>__{ANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.}
<ACTION>__{Suddenly there is a clicking of a key in the lock.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh my God.  My flatmate.  I'm sorry -- there's no excuse for him.}
<ACTION>__{Spike walks in.}

<DIAL>__{Hi.}

<DIAL>__{I'm just going to go into the kitchen to get some food -- and then I'm going to tell you a story that will make your balls shrink to the size of raisins.}
<ACTION>__{And leaves them in the corridor.}
<CHAR>__{ANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Probably best not tell anyone about this.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.}
<CHAR>__{ANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Bye.}
<ACTION>__{And she leaves, with just a touch of William's hand.  Spike comes out of the kitchen, eating something white out of a styrofoam container with a spoon.}

<DIAL>__{There's something wrong with this yogurt.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{Well, there you go.}

Her face registers not jut surprise, certainly not a simple smile.  His being there is a complicated thing. Cut back to him.  He does a small wave.  She pauses as the whole paraphernalia of the upcoming scene passes between them.  The movie divides them.  But then she begins to walk through it, and followed by her cluster, she makes her way towards him.  When she reaches him, the security guard stands back a pace, and her people hold back.

<CHAR>__{JEREMY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No, it's just one question per person.}
<CHAR>__{ANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No, let him... ask away.  You were saying?}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes, I just wondered whether if it turned out that this... person...}
<CHAR>__{OTHER JOURNALIST} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(to William)}
<DIAL>__{His name is Thacker.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thanks.  I just wondered if Mr. Thacker realized he'd been a daft prick and got down on his knees and begged you to reconsider, whether you would... reconsider.}
<ACTION>__{We cut to Max, Bella, Bernie and Honey, all watching.  Then back to Anna.}
<CHAR>__{ANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.}
<CHAR>__{WILLIAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's very good news.  The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.}
<ACTION>__{Anna whispers something to Jeremy.}
<CHAR>__{JEREMY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Dominic -- if you'd like to ask your question again?}
<CHAR>__{QUESTIONER 1} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes -- Anna -- how long are you intending to stay here in Britain?}
<ACTION>__{Pause.  Anna looks up at William.  He nods.}
<CHAR>__{ANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Indefinitely.}
<ACTION>__{They both smile -- suddenly the press gets what's going on -- music -- noise -- they all turn and flash, flash, flash photos of William.  Max and Bella kiss.  Bernie kisses a total stranger. Spike finally makes it -- he's bright red from running.}
<CHAR>__{SPIKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What happened?}
<CHAR>__{HONEY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It was good.}
<ACTION>__{Honey hugs him.  It's a new experience for Spike. Cut to William's face -- flash after flash -- still looking at Anna.  They are both smiling.}
<LOC>__{INT./EXT. THE HEMPEL ZEN GARDEN WITH MARQUEEN - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Anna and William at their wedding -- they kiss and walk into the crowd. Honey, a bridesmaid in peach satin -- she is surrounded by at least four other bridesmaids, all under five. Nearby, Tony standing, glowing, beside his fabulous, pyramidical wedding cake. William's mother is not quite happy with how he's looking.  She tries to brush his hair. Max, dressed in the most devastating Bond-like white tuxedo is dancing with Anna -- thrilled.  He does a rather flashy little move.  Cut to Bella who is watching and laughing. Martin, in an awkward tweed suit, is jiggling to the beat of a song, entirely happy in the corner.}
<LOC>__{EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{A huge premier -- screaming crowds -- Anna and William get out of the car, she holding his hand --  looking ultimately gorgeous -- he in a black tie that doesn't quite fit.  He's startled.}
<LOC>__{EXT. GARDEN - DAY}
<ACTION>__{A pretty green communal garden.  Children are playing, watched by mothers, one of whom holds a new baby in a papoose.  A very old couple wander along slowly. A small tai chi group moves mysteriously.  And as the camera glides, it passes a couple sitting on a single, simple wooden bench overlooking the garden.  He is reading, she is just looking out, totally relaxed, holding his hand, pregnant.  It is William and Anna.}
