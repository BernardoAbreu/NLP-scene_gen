<A>__{we're tracking with a moving bag of peanuts behind a row of boy's heads. on the screen in front of them, a "medi eval era" sword battle between the great kumar kapur and a legion of bad guys. we hear the sound of cracking nuts as we move from manooj to three kids we've seen in the neighborhood (two boys manooj's age and shoba, who's shambu's age) and then to shambu, each kid dipping into the bag in his turn. finally: max's (and on the other side of him, amrita and poomina.) the bag arrives... empty.}
