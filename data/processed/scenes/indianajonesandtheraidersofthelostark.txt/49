<D>__{unbelievable!}
<A>__{at the end of the bar, the mongolian has come back to life. he shakes out his head, then reaches inside his coat and pulls out a mauser pistol. indy smashes a chair over the head of the giant sherpa and the huge creature goes down. the mongolian points his mauser through the smoke and flame at indy. suddenly, the mongolian is shot dead. marion stands beneath her stuffed raven with the baretta. indy moves quickly through the flames, his eyes scanning the floor. he picks up his bullwhip and his crumpled felt hat. he peers through the smoke till he spots marion moving among the burning furniture.}
