<L>__{exterior studio press conference day}
<A>__{the studio soundstages as a backdrop, viktor approaches a podium and a forest of microphones, revelling in his recent fame by association.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(tapping the microphone)}
<D>__{is this on?}
<C>__{reporter 1}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{taransky, viktor. t a r a n s k y, v i k t o r.}
<C>__{reporter 1}
<D>__{yeah, but who are you?}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(patronizing smile)}
<D>__{i am a two time academy award nominated director with over eighteen films to my credit thus far including my latest release, "sunrise, sunset". who are you?}
<A>__{a reporter rolls her eyes at his pomposity.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{i will not be taking any questions. however i do have a statement to read on behalf of my leading lady, simone.}
<P>__{(reading from his statement)}
<D>__{"to whom it may concern. i'm deeply grateful for the extraordinary public response to mr. taransky's film. at this time i will be conducting no interviews or making publicity appearances since i am really nothing without the beautiful worlds and characters mr. taransky creates for me. i politely request that the press respect my privacy and let the work speak for itself. all questions and inquiries should be directed to mr. taransky to whom i entrust all aspects of my career. yours very truly, simone".}
<A>__{the reporters all call out at once.}
<C>__{reporter 2}
<D>__{ viktor, viktor, who's simone dating?}
<C>__{reporter 3}
<D>__{ viktor, where'd you find her?}
<C>__{reporter 4}
<D>__{ is simone her real name?}
<C>__{reporter 5}
<D>__{ what's she got to hide?}
<C>__{reporter 1}
<D>__{ is she the new garbo?}
<C>__{reporter 2}
<D>__{ who's garbo?}
<A>__{viktor silences the reporters by theatrically raising his hands.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{i thought i made it clear no questions regarding simone.}
<P>__{(bringing the press}
<D>__{conference to a hasty}
<P>__{conclusion)}
<D>__{now, i would like to close by announcing that miss simone begins production today on her next film, "eternity forever". this project has been near and dear to my heart since i wrote it nine years ago.}
<P>__{(a tinge of bitterness, then a smile)}
<D>__{i thank you.}
<A>__{viktor exits the podium. a voice stops him in his tracks.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{who do you think you're fooling, taransky?}
<A>__{viktor turns. the voice belongs to over zealous, crusading, truth seeking investigative reporter, max sayer, accompanied by his assistant, milton.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{do i know you?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{max sayer national echo.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(regaining his composure, a smirk)}
<D>__{don't you have a real story to write? why aren't you in latin america?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{this is the story.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{i remember when the echo had class the paper that could bring down governments.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{our leaders aren't presidents anymore they're pop stars and screen idols. if woodward and bernstein were alive today, they'd be right here in hollywood with me.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{they are alive, sayer.}
<A>__{milton confirms that woodward and bernstein are still living.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{so they're probably here.}
<P>__{(hardly missing a beat)}
<D>__{you might be able to sell this 'disappearing act' to the rest of the world, but i'm not buying it. what's really behind this simone woman? the public has a right to know. why is she staying out of sight? and why the hell is she with you? i don't want you to take this the wrong way, viktor, but you're not exactly cecil b. demille more run of the mill.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity, sayer. look it up.}
<A>__{viktor walks away.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(calling after him)}
<D>__{oh, i know all about integrity. i know even more about persistence. look that one up.}
<A>__{max watches viktor depart, with obvious suspicion.}
