<A>__{stanley is standing at the filing cabinet going through files. he takes some files and puts them to one side. then, satisfied that he's got everything he needs, he picks up the files and turns to leave. bb is standing at the door watching him.}

<C>__{bb}
<D>__{it's against the law to steal files. i could call and have you arrested and sent to jail, right now.}

<D>__{i will put everything back, nobody's the wiser.}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{you work for the commission, is that it?}
<A>__{stan nods "yes."}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{doesn't the commission have enough information? they got to send out guys like you to spy?}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{well, we just started out, and if we had some really good hard facts of some infractions, it would give us a lot of credibility in the community.}
<A>__{bb walks closer to stanley, looks at him for a second, grabs him by his tie and pushes him backwards. stanley crashes into the filing cabinet.}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{you know what your big problem is, stanley? you're lazy. if you want to find out stuff, then you dig... you get on the phone... you canvas... 'we're from the home improvement commission...' go find your leads... that's what we do all the time. you're just lazy, stanley. if we're doing something wrong, you should collect all your evidence. instead, you snoop around... steal files. what is this? undercover time? you think you're breaking up some big drug ring? is this the mafia you've infiltrated? all you've got here is a bunch of guys selling tin for christ sake!}

<D>__{you want some files?}
<A>__{he walks over to the filing cabinet, flips through some files and pulls out three files. stanley has gotten up from the floor. bb throws the files down on the desk.}

<A>__{stanley gathers up the files from the desk.}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{go on, get out of here.}
<A>__{stanley starts for the door, and turns back.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{why are you doing this?}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{if it's not gonna be you, it's gonna be somebody else... and if it's not tonight, it's gonna be another time.}
<A>__{stanley exits the office. bb picks up the files that stanley had taken out of the filing cabinet, and starts to put them back. then he slams the filing drawers closed very hard.}
