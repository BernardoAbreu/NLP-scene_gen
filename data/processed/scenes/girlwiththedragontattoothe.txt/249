<L>__{interior martin's basement night}
<A>__{blomkvist hangs from the block and tackle rig, leather strap around his neck now, fed through a ceiling eyelet. with a big sewing scissors, martin cuts through and removes blomkvist's pants and underwear }
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{it might amuse you to know that while you were over here having dinner with me and liv who, by the way, finds me very conventional irina was down here in the cage. who's irina, you ask? a girl i met in belarus. just another girl. another immigrant whore. who misses them?}
<A>__{he returns to his work bench to lay out various tools next to his gun and a desk phone.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{your sister wasn't just another girl.}
<A>__{martin comes back quickly and yanks a strap that cinches the noose tighter around blomkvist's neck as it lifts him onto his tiptoes.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{what happened to her.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{you're choking me }
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{you found her?}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{you killed her.}
<A>__{martin just stares at him confused. then }
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{you useless fuckin detective.}
<A>__{he lets go of the strap and blomkvist's feet come back down to the floor. as martin returns to his workbench, blomkvist is not only scared to death, but confused now. did martin not kill her? then martin is back in front of him with a roll of cellophane, pulls on the strap again until blomkvist is balancing on his tiptoes, and ties it off.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{too tight to talk?}
<A>__{it is. blomkvist can utter no sound but a gag.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{good. i'm tired of talking to you.}
<A>__{he wraps blomkvist's head in cellophane, completely cutting off his ability to breathe, and calmly watches him struggle. ...}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{would you like me to do something about that?}
<A>__{blomkvist desperately nods as he's about to suffocate. martin watches another several moments ... then pokes a finger through the cellophane into blomkvist's gasping mouth.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{see? i'm not a monster.}
<A>__{he frames a wide shot of his naked prey. turns on some music. takes a moment to collect himself from all this strenuous work. brushes back his hair like he wants to look presentable in the shot. then smiles pleasantly }
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{you know, i've never had a man in here. i've never touched a man as a matter of fact. except my father, of course. but that was my duty. harriet's, too.}
<A>__{the circulation to blomkvist's head is being cut off by the strap. his fingers behind his naked back claw at the concrete wall to try to relieve some of the weight on the noose, but can't get a grip. martin watches the struggle calmly, and just as calmly offers:}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{it's time. i don't want to be late for my date with our girlfriend.}
<A>__{he puts on a plastic rain poncho. a painter's mask. plastic goggles. surgeons gloves. picks up a hunting knife. steps up to blomkvist. looks at his eyes. brings his own head close to his victim's }
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{goodbye, mikael.}
<A>__{he pulls the strap, lifting blomkvist's toes off the floor, closing off his air again ... and is about to gut him like a wild boar ... when he hears a sound like some kind of animal behind him ... he turns and sees her coming at him from out of the shadows by the steel door he darts for the gun he left on the workbench salander just as quickly swings a 5 iron his 5 iron like a baseball bat. its metal wedged end arcs through the gloom and slams into the side of his head, sending him tumbling to the floor. he struggles up to his knees, and she swings the club again, splitting flesh and crushing bone as he crumples the floor. she takes the gun from the bench and shoves it in her other back pocket. grabs the hunting knife and shackles key and hurries over to blomkvist who only witnessed part of the spectacle before losing consciousness she saws through the leather strap around his neck. unlocks the chain. as he sinks to his knees on the floor, blood rushes to his head, bringing him back to life just enough to see what she can't behind her martin, blood streaming from the gash in his head, getting to his feet. but he's not coming at them; he's trying to get out blomkvist tries to say her name to get her to look. lifts a hand to try to pointerior she turns and glimpses the monster as he disappears out the steel door. looks back at blomkvist, still handcuffed on the floor, and, like a child asking a parent for permission }
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{may i kill him?}
<A>__{nothing in his life would allow him to agree to such a thing until now. now it's as if her years of violence and degradation have been passed to him. he nods. she puts the hunting knife in his hand. pulls the gun from her back pocket, checks the clip, flicks off the safety, and turns to leave }
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{he has more guns in the den }
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{she comes up the basement stairs, leading with her gun. distant thunder rumbles. she crosses through the kitchen to the living room, and down the hall to the study. she eases around the doorway the room is empty looks to the gun case sees there are only two rifles there now. she hears an engine start outside. hurries back through the house. sees out the picture window the taillights of martin's car receding fast down the road as clouds burst. she bangs out the front door. runs halfway down the hill in the rain to where she left her motorcycle, jumps on and kick starts it.}
