<A>__{karen stands there with her car keys and purse as marshall paints the trim on the boat.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{remember, pay attention to how she talks about foley, her tone. do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell burdon. tell her you think he's a nice guy. no, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it. if she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her? i bet nothing. so she still likes him enough to stick her neck out. you think that's possible? what kind of guy is he?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{he's pretty laid back, confident.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{he remind you of that guy, tillman?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{not at all.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{but you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{maybe. but you're also curious about the man. twice last night you asked your married boyfriend nicolet about him. you were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{my married boyfriend setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity. i couldn't believe it.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{you like the wild ones, don't you? tillman, nicolet and now foley. you know, i've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{foley kid napped me.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{yeah, but you talked all the way from gci to the turnpike. it sounds more like a first date than a kidnapping.}
<A>__{she gives him a look. he goes back to his painting.}
<C>__{marshall }
<D>__{go talk to the ex wife.}
