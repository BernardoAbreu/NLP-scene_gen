<A>__{as the forest explodes around them. the chopper is buffeted. the forward canopy is shattered by shrapnel. rambo is hit in the shoulder and chest. his left arm broken above the elbow. one of the prisoners is moaning, holding his bloody forehead. rambo pulls up on the collective, sending blinding pain through his arm. the huey shoots up out of the jungle, spinning as it pops up. it slips sideways through the air, seemingly going out of control. then it arcs back, roaring right at the camera.}
