<A>__{the exhausted marchers drag themselves back to their feet and start to march again. at the rear of the group, someone taps carter, who is still listening to his music. carter gets up, hoists his backpack, and marches away. behind him, dieter's pack is left, forgotten, on the jungle trail.}

<A>__{dieter stumbles along, exhausted. he reaches the edge of a stream that runs under the foliage, and his feet slip on the stones. he falls, into the rocky stream. behind him, the army of compys pours over the little hill he just crested. they disappear for a moment, down an incline and then swarm over his body. in a frenzy of splashing, dieter shrugs them off and crawls away, through the stream. he gets to his feet but falls again, this time over a log. a geyser of water splashes up in the air behind the log as dieter drops out of sight. the compys leap over the log and disappear from view too, throwing up their own splashes of water. screeching, chirping, and the sound of tearing flesh mixes with dieter's}
