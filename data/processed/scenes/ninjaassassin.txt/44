<L>__{interior mika's apartment living room day}
<A>__{close on the box. it sits on her desk, calling as another box once called to pandora. she opens it. inside are a series of cataloged photographs taken in the style of 1970's archeologists (like those of the dead sea scrolls) of the lost chapter of ibn battuta. the scrolls contain his 14th century islamic writing and several sketches. there is also a very rough map that suggests the location of the orphanage. images of the orphanage, of the children training and their ordeals, bloody combat, ritual bindings, beatings on the nightingale floor. there is a scroll that she unrolls revealing the lineage tree of the nine clans. also in the box is a single vhs tape. she pushes the tape into the player. it's a recording of a surveillance camera staring at the front of the sabatin house. a man walks up to the house and rings's the bell. we cannot see his face. sabatin opens the door. they exchange words. sabatin seems wary but invites the man in. mika doesn't understand why this is significant. she hits fast forward until she sees a flash as the man exits. she stops, rewinds and plays it again. as he steps out of the shadow of the house, she sees his face it is raizo. she is startled when someone pounds on the door. it seems like it might rattle off its hinges as she hurries to open it revealing maslow and he's not happy.}
<C>__{maslow }
<D>__{you lied to me.}
<A>__{he pushes into the room and slams the door behind him.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{what're you }
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{i told you to stop using my confirmation code.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{i did }
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{dammit, mika }
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{...i'm sorry, it was the only way i could get the evidence.}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{shit....}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{what happened? everything's fucking happened.}
<A>__{he tries to dial it down, succeeds, but only a little.}
<C>__{maslow }
<D>__{when you were slapping my code all over town like some phone number in a bathroom, did you happen to notice the classification code on the cases you were digging through?}
<A>__{she knows.}
<C>__{maslow }
<D>__{what did it say?}
<C>__{mika}
<P>__{(quietly) dnp.}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{that's right. dnp. do not fucking pursue!}
<C>__{mika}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{actually that would be dnfp }
<A>__{flash image interior maslow's office afternoon we see men and women in dark suits, their expressions deadly serious, tossing through everything he has in the place.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{right now there are people from internal affairs, cia, homeland security and for all i know the martian fucking military in my office tearing the place apart.}
<C>__{maslow }
<D>__{i don't know what they're looking for but i think you do.}
<A>__{she shifts nervously, no poker face. she turns and leads him into her home office. with the key from the tampax box she opens the drawer. maslow watches as she pulls out the contents of sabatin's box as well as the illegally requisitioned evidence.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{most of this is from sabatin. copies of what i think are the lost chapters of the rihle. i think it describes the original location of the ozunu clan but my 14th century arabic is a little rusty.}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{and this?}
<A>__{meaning the dvd.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{that's how it started. i made a mistake, mixed up the case code and they sent me that.}
<A>__{a moment later the dvd is playing, raizo and the other ninja dancing through the shadows.}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{...christ.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{yeah. i know. i don't understand why they're fighting though. it could be a clan war.}
<A>__{maslow starts to put it together.}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{so you requisitioned this by accident. you used my code which is why you didn't want to show me this. which is also why they're tearing apart my office right now.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{i'm sorry ryan. you have to know i didn't mean for you to get in trouble...}
<C>__{mika }
<D>__{i just thought if this was real, if these clans were killing people, you know, it was our job to try to stop them.}
<A>__{he eyes her.}
<C>__{mika }
<D>__{isn't that what your dad would do?}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{okay, that's low.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{look, i know i broke the rules. i will explain what i did and accept the consequences.}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{very noble of you but i've got the feeling this isn't a slap on the wrist kinda consequence. let me take this and try to make some sense of this shitstorm you started. in the meantime, you will not say anything to anybody. capiche?}
<A>__{she nods.}
