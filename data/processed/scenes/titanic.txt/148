<L>__{interior ruth's suite day}
<A>__{rose is dressed for the day, and is in the middle of helping ruth with her corset. the tight bindings do not inhibit ruth's fury at all.}
<C>__{ruth}
<A>__{you are not to see that boy again, do you understand me rose? i forbid it! rose has her knee at the base of her mother's back and is pulling the corset strings with both hands.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{oh, stop it, mother. you'll give yourself a nosebleed. ruth pulls away from her, and crosses to the door, locking it. clack!}
<C>__{ruth}
<P>__{(wheeling on her)}
<A>__{rose, this is not a game! our situation is precarious. you know the money's gone!}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{of course i know it's gone. you remind me every day!}
<C>__{ruth}
<A>__{your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name. and that name is the only card we have to play. rose turns her around and grabs the corset strings again. ruth sucks in her waist and rose pulls.}
<C>__{ruth}
<A>__{i don't understand you. it is a fine match with hockley, and it will insure our survival.}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(hurt and lost)}
<A>__{how can you put this on my shoulders? rose turns to her, and we see what rose sees the naked fear in her mother's eyes.}
<C>__{ruth}
<A>__{do you want to se me working as a seamstress? is that what you want? do you want to see our fine things sold at an auction, our memories scattered to the winds? my god, rose, how can you be so selfish?}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{it's so unfair.}
<C>__{ruth}
<A>__{of course it's unfair! we're women. our choices are never easy. rose pulls the corset tighter.}
