<A>__{a nervous joyce walks off the plane into the arrivals area. she scans the crowd of friends, family, lovers and limo drivers waiting to meet the disembarking passengers. where is harvey? what will he look like? as joyce surveys the unfamiliar faces, she imagines different versions of an animated, illustrated harvey among the people. she double takes as sees the r. crumb harvey hairy, scary, smelly and picking his nose. joyce rubs her eyes. next she sees the brando harvey (gary dumm), but unfortunately he disappears fast. disappointed, joyce notices the realistic drew friedman harvey walking towards her. she smiles as he dissolves into:}
<C>__{harvey }
<D>__{hey. are you joyce?}
<A>__{joyce turns around. the flesh and blood harvey pekar stands before her not quite as bad as the crumb version, not quite as good as the dumm version, but still acceptable. she sighs with relief.}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{hi, harvey. we finally meet in person.}
<A>__{she politely offers her hand. harvey shakes it, but he looks overwhelmed, worried and pessimistic.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{hiya. look, before we get started with any of this, ya might as well know right off the bat. i had a vasectomy.}
<A>__{joyce lets go of his hand. she stares at him in disbelief.}
