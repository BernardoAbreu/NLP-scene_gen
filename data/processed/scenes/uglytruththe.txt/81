<A>__{on set, mike addresses the camera.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{so there you have it. never assume a girl is easy, or assume she's a prude. there are many layers in between and it's your job, gentlemen, to peel back those layers and figure out exactly what type of woman you are dealing with.}
<A>__{nearby, a confused joy looks at abby.}
<C>__{joy}
<D>__{what happened to him? that sounded almost enlightened.}
<A>__{abby doesn't know weather to be pleased or worried.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{because once you do peel back those layers, my friends, her lady garden awaits. and i'm pretty sure you're gonna want to fertilize that patch of petunias. and that there is the ugly truth.}
<C>__{joy}
<D>__{and he's back.}
<B>__{at the anchor desk}
<A>__{larry turns to the camera.}

<D>__{i hope mine do...}
<A>__{abby rolls her eyes as mike walks up.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{yes, the city gets treated to flower vagina metaphors. georgia o'keefe would be so pleased.}
<A>__{at this, a slick agent in a suit, 30's, walks up and slaps mike on the shoulder.}
