<L>__{ext fire escape, seconds later}
<A>__{they reach the bottom of the ladder and are pinned down by gunfire from above. chev gives her a look that says it all.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i had to see if you were telling the truth... oh, and you have my purse.}
<A>__{chev notices the purse still over his shoulder, takes it off and hands it to her. with a quick upward glance he breaks cover and squeezes off 4 shots, nailing two hoods on the fire escape.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{come on! wait }
<A>__{she freezes one of the dead hoods lands with a thud in the spot she would’ve been }
<P>__{chev (cont’d)}
<D>__{... ok, now come on.}
<A>__{eve is pale as a sheet. she steps over the body like she was avoiding a particularly large pile of cow shit... chev grabs her hand and yanks her along. he spots eve’s car parked backwards across the street and they make a desperate run for it as more shots whiz and ricochet off the pavement. eve is rifling through her purse as they run. naturally chev assumes she’s looking for the car keys.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{darn it, i forgot to take my birth control pill.}
<A>__{chev answers the gunfire with shots of his own, buying them a few seconds, then grabs the purse and shakes the contents out onto the ground. no keys.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{where’s the keys?}
<A>__{eve holds out her hand, where she’s had them all along.}
<P>__{chev (cont’d) (taking them)}
<D>__{cool.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{my stuff...}
<A>__{she looks like she’s about to wander around, gathering up her things, when another volley of shots blows out the passenger window of the car. chev picks eve up like a sack of grain and throws her, head first, through the passenger window, into the car, then runs around the other side, hops in and peels out.}
