<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{be cool. everybody's gonna get in.}
<A>__{patrick alternates between tending the crowd and throwing anxious glances down the block towards cinnabar's home. torn between exhilaration at seeing his dream come true and disappointment that cinnabar's not there to share it. people chomping to get in. across the street shotgun watches with dismay. patrick hears voices down the street. looks up to see cinnabar walking towards the club. his smile freezes when he sees pearl right behind her. trying to stop cinn.}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{...i've seen things. in there. last night. you did too. don't tell me you didn't. you were crying like a baby.}
<C>__{cinnabar}
<D>__{you said the vision, the images. they're just that. just pictures. they can't hurt you. that's what you always said.}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{i lied.}
<C>__{cinnabar}
<D>__{all the more reason i should be here.}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{please. it's for your own good.}
<C>__{cinnabar}
<D>__{you said bad things hurt places. so maybe good things heal them. good things are happening here. maybe for the first time ever. and maybe that's all it takes.}
<A>__{pearl sees she can't stop cinn. any more than her mother could have stopped pearl when she was her age.}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{i hope so, child. i really hope so.}
<A>__{she can only watch as cinnabar gives patrick a big hug and follows him and the rest of the crowd into the club.}
