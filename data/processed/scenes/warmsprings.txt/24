<L>__{exterior roosevelt summer home day}
<A>__{a large but unpretentious house with a sweeping lawn that looks out over the icy waters of the bay of fundy.}
<L>__{exterior porch late afternoon}
<A>__{eleanor sits quietly on the front porch knitting in a world of her own. a few feet away also in a world of his own sits louis, overdressed for summer in a three piece suit. an overflowing ashtray is by his side and piles of newspaper lie at his feet. he holds up a paper to eleanor with the photo of franklin and the boy scouts.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{he's a natural.}
<A>__{eleanor gives it a cursory glance then looks out to where franklin and the children come bounding up the lawn. franklin and elliot break out from the rest and begin racing up the lawn. franklin, no match for his son's speed, loses. he doubles over, trying to catch his breath.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{vae victis! ("woe to the}
<P>__{conquered!")}
<A>__{caught up in his victory, elliot doesn't see franklin sneak up behind him and tackle him to the ground.}
<C>__{franklin}
<P>__{festina lente! ("not so fast!")}
<A>__{one by one the other children all pile on top of franklin and elliot.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{dinner is in one half hour! come in and change, children!}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{up! up, chicks! you heard your mother!}
<A>__{everyone runs up the porch stairs and into the house except franklin.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{go wash up.}
<A>__{utterly spent, franklin lays on the grass, not moving.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{hey, boss! are you all right?}
<A>__{slowly, franklin gets up and walks with great effort up the porch stairs.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{i'm fine.}
<P>__{(re: her knitting)}
<D>__{oh, that's pretty, babs.}
<A>__{he puts his hand on eleanor's shoulder and leans in to buss her cheek but eleanor quickly stands.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{i must check on dinner.}
<A>__{there is a cursory formality to her words and little warmth.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{very well.}
<A>__{she goes into the house. louis then hands franklin letters.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{tired?}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{of you? never.}
<A>__{wearily, he sorts through the envelopes.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{why don't you nap before dinner?}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{yes, dear.}
<A>__{franklin heads into the house leaning heavily against the screen door struggling for control.}
