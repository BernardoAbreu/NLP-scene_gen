<L>__{interior dining room night}
<A>__{linda is busy serving everyone, running in and out of the kitchen bringing more things, and removing used plates, etc. linda's eye is swollen and discolored. the guests look at linda's eye and then cast a naughty boy glance at babe brother. linda stops serving to pay attention to an elderly man, who deliberately bends one of her spoons. she catches another man putting a fork in his pocket and an elderly lady putting a cigarette out in one of her plates. as she is about to confront the man about pocketing her spoon, a peal of laughter forces her to turn around only to witness a lady knocking over a glass filled with a green drink with her elbow. the stain spreads across the table cloth in an even manner like a single wave. she watches it move from one end of the table to the other. harry is seated in the middle. the composition hints at the last supper.}
