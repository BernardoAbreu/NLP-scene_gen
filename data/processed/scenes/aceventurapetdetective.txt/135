<A>__{a large, abandoned industrial facility. einhorn parks, disappears inside… a few beats later, ace kills the engine and exits singing the score to "mission impossible".}
<L>__{interior industrial plant day}
<A>__{immense machines and swimming pool sized cauldrons. ace cautiously makes his way through the desolate site, singing quietly now. he stops when he hears a familiar voice.}
<C>__{john madden }
<D>__{i particularly like the match ups of the defense.}
<A>__{ace sees a weird sight: a huge tv projection screen tuned to the super bowl pre game show. marino is tied to a football tackling sled. the two thugs take turns running into dan with their shoulders, driving him back five feet each time.}
<C>__{john madden }
<D>__{…but the real story of this game is the absence of dan marino. him being kidnapped and all has got to be a strain on this miami team. i really feel sorry for those guys! i mean, it's hard enough enduring the pressure of the super bowl, without your star quarterback gettin' himself kidnapped. this is the whole ball of wax, folks! you wanna' get kidnapped, you do it in the off season!…}
<A>__{marino looks incredulously at the screen. next to him, snowflake "watches" from a ground level cistern serving as an ad hoc tank. ace sneaks closer.}
