<L>__{interior mariachi's hotel room day}
<A>__{mariachi opens his room, tosses his guitar onto the bed and hangs his jacket in the closet. he has only his white t shirt underneath. he glances above the bed to a plaque bearing a mace and two crossed swords. he checks out the shower and washes his face in the sink. he sits down on his bed. a few seconds later he drops back and lays there a minute before kicking the door shut. he tries to sleep.}
