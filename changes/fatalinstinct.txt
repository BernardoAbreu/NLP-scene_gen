<TRANS>__{FADE IN ON:}
<LOC>__{EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The sultry dampness of a blistering summer hangs in the night air. People stroll the boardwalk looking for a cool breeze. The soft rhythms of a jazz concert float from the band shell. CLOSE SHOT - A PAIR OF SEXY HIGH HEELS and a woman's shapely legs, walking along the wooden pier. OPENING TITLES & CREDITS OVER. After several steps, a discarded piece of gum sticks to one of her shoes, stretching out stickily. Two steps later, a piece of paper sticks to the gum, flopping awkwardly with each step. The MOVING CAMERA PANS UP her gorgeous legs and sensuous body. She wears a loose summer dress that floats like gossamer around her soft curves. Her hair is long and blond.}
<CHAR>__{NED } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{To some guys, women are like a cheap puzzle... with pieces that just don't fit. They think the soul of a woman is darker than a back alley... more tangled than a telephone cord... and colder than a Klondike Bar in Canada. But those guys don't even have a clue.}
<ACTION>__{She stops at the railing. We see an incredibly beautiful face and cool, alluring eyes. This is LOLA CAIN. The term "femme fatale" was coined for her. She's on display... and knows it.}
<CHAR>__{NED } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{When you know women the way I do, you understand exactly what what makes them tick... what makes them hum... what makes them jiggle up and down when they walk. And it's not the kind of thing you can learn from a correspondence course.}
<ACTION>__{The CAMERA MOVES with her as she walks on, passing TWO MEN whose eyes are glued to her. We HOLD ON THEM. One is NED RAVINE, in his thirties, stalwart, handsome, hair trimmed neatly, but with a feel of loose ends about him... coat slung over his shoulder, sleeves rolled up, the sweat dampening his shirt. He's a cop. A plain clothes detective who's been around the block a few times and still gets lost. Next to him is ARCH, his partner. Older, if not in years, at least in mileage. Dependable, solid, with no great aspirations except to reach the end of a shift intact. He's eating Nachos from a cardboard container, licking the cheese off his fingers. The CAMERA PUSHES IN to NED. His eyes are fixed on Lola. ANGLE - LOLA - NED'S POV She walks to the other side of the pier... as more paper sticks to the gum on her shoe. She stands at the railing.}
<CHAR>__{NED } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{There are two kinds of women in this world... and I've known 'em both.}
<ACTION>__{ANGLE - ARCH Arch heaves an exasperated sigh and looks toward Ned. The CAMERA PULLS BACK to INCLUDE NED. It isn't "voice-over" narration at all. Ned is actually talking out loud.}
<CHAR>__{NED } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{One will take you for a fast ride on a bumpy road with no seat belt. But the other kind...}
<CHAR>__{ARCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(interrupts)}
<DIAL>__{Jeez... knock off the chatter, will ya.}
<CHAR>__{NED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Just trying to keep you awake, Arch.}
<CHAR>__{ARCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm awake! Where do you come up with all that crap about women?}
<CHAR>__{NED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's true. Women are very complex, but if you know how to read 'em... they're an open book. You can always tell the rotten apples from the peaches.}
<CHAR>__{ARCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Are you kiddin'?}
<CHAR>__{NED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'd stake my career on it. Anybody ever proves me wrong, I'll throw away my badge.}
<CHAR>__{ARCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Aayyhh... women are trouble...}
<CHAR>__{NED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I used to believe that too. Until I married Lana. Now, she... is a peach.}
<CHAR>__{ARCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, well you're a lucky stiff, pal. Ya hold down two jobs. Got a beautiful wife waitin' for ya at home. Everything a guy could ever want, including NO kids.}
<CHAR>__{NED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'd love to have kids.}
<CHAR>__{ARCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What?! Rug-rats? Give me a break!}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(looks around)}
<DIAL>__{Jeez, I hate stakeouts. What makes you think Milo's gonna show up here?}
<CHAR>__{NED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Logic. He knocked off all those banks. He's got cash. He's gonna want to spend it. This is one of the few places that still takes cash. Sooner or later... he's gotta turn up.}
<CHAR>__{ARCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And how we s'posed to recognize this scumbag?}
<CHAR>__{NED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The "Support Hose Bandit"? When you see him... you'll know him.}
<ACTION>__{In the b.g., MILO CRUMLEY, the "Support Hose Bandit", ambles by casually, unnoticed, sucking on a cherry Snow-Cone through the panty-hose pulled down over his head.}
<CHAR>__{ARCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{These are the best damn Nachos in North America. Maybe the world!}
<ACTION>__{He pops the last chip in his mouth, licks his fingers and turns the container over.}
<CHAR>__{ARCH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm empty. I'm gonna get a refill. You want some?}
<ACTION>__{Ned shakes his head. Arch heads off to the Nacho stand. Ned steps over to the railing... gazes out at the ocean. A SAXOPHONE begins to wail a scorching, romantic melody... a recurrent tune that will come to be known as LOLA'S THEME. A beat later... Lola moves to Ned's side at the railing. He tries to ignore her presence, peering into the darkness. Lola digs in her purse for a pack of cigarettes.}
<CHAR>__{LOLA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Got a light?}
<CHAR>__{NED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sure.}
<ACTION>__{Ned pulls out a small flashlight, shines it in her purse. She pulls a cigarette out of the pack, puts it to her lips... her eyes on Ned, sizing him up.}
<CHAR>__{LOLA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{How about a match?}
<CHAR>__{NED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No thanks. I have plenty.}
<ACTION>__{He pulls out a handful of matchbooks, shows her, then stuffs them back in his pocket. He turns and walks along the pier. She falls into step beside him, lighting her own cigarette. A saxophone player named DIZZY follows behind them, continuing to play. He's the actual source of the romantic THEME MUSIC we've been hearing.}
<CHAR>__{LOLA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You really are incredibly stupid, aren't you? I like that in a man.}
<CHAR>__{NED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'd be insulted, but I know you're serious.}
<CHAR>__{LOLA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You sound so sure of yourself.}
<CHAR>__{NED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm not as dumb as I look.}
<CHAR>__{LOLA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Let me buy you a drink, Mr. uh...}
<CHAR>__{NED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Ravine. Ned Ravine. And you are...?}
<CHAR>__{LOLA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thirsty. What about that drink?}
<CHAR>__{NED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm on duty.}

<CHAR>__{LOLA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oooo... and I bet you have a big gun.}
<CHAR>__{NED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You lose.}
<ACTION>__{Lola looks toward a nearby hot dog vendor.}
<CHAR>__{LOLA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{If I can't buy you a drink...}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(nods toward vendor)}
<DIAL>__{...let me buy you one of those.}
<CHAR>__{NED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Who can say no to a weiner?}
<CHAR>__{LOLA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Not me.}
<ACTION>__{Lola turns to the hot dog VENDOR, raising two fingers.}
<CHAR>__{LOLA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Two dogs. Hot.}
<ACTION>__{She takes them... hands one to Ned. He picks up the plastic mustard container to put mustard on her hot dog first.}
<CHAR>__{NED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You come here often?}
<CHAR>__{LOLA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Only when I'm in heat.}
<ACTION>__{Ned REACTS to this, squeezing the container. A stream of mustard squirts out, hitting the front of Lola's dress.}
<CHAR>__{NED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh! Sorry.}
<ACTION>__{Flustered, he stuffs his hot dog into his inside jacket pocket, then tries to wipe the mustard off Lola's dress, smearing it all over her, making it worse. She watches him with a cool, detached gaze as he fumbles ingenuously. Suddenly, Ned stops, looking off. He sees... Milo Crumley going into the PUBLIC RESTROOM. Ned starts to leave. Lola grabs his hand, holding it tightly against her breast.}
<CHAR>__{LOLA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Where ya going?}
<CHAR>__{NED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Get something to wipe it off.}
<CHAR>__{LOLA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's okay. You're doing just fine.}
<CHAR>__{NED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'll get you a wet paper towel.}
<ACTION>__{He heads for the men's room... signaling to Arch, who's waiting in line at the Nacho stand. Arch motions at the long line... all UNIFORMED COPS... shrugging helplessly.}
<LOC>__{INT. MEN'S ROOM ON PIER - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Several MEN are at the urinals. Milo, still wearing the panty hose over his head, washes his face at the sink. He looks up, sees Ned enter. Ned sees Milo... reacts, pulling the frankfurter out of his pocket and pointing it.}
<CHAR>__{NED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hold it right there, Milo!}
<ACTION>__{The Men turn, seeing Ned pointing the frankfurter.}
<CHAR>__{RESTROOM PATRON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Look out! He's got a weenie!}
<ACTION>__{Milo bolts, slamming into Ned, knocking him back through the door of a stall, into the lap of the MAN inside.}
<LOC>__{EXT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Milo bursts out, colliding with Arch. They both go down in a flurry of Nacho chips and cheese. Arch helps Milo to his feet, apologizing profusely... picking up the gun that Milo dropped, handing it back to him. Milo sprints off down the pier. A beat later, Ned bursts out the door... dashing after Milo. ANGLE - ALONG THE PIER Milo runs frantically, knocking people aside! He ducks into...}
<LOC>__{INT. BUMPER CAR PAVILION - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{...and drags a FLUSTERED MAN out of a bumper car, jumps in, and speeds away! A beat later, Ned runs up, followed by Arch. Ned flashes his badge at a FRECKLE-FACED KID in one of the bumper cars.}
<CHAR>__{NED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Police emergency! I need your car!}
<ACTION>__{He pulls the kid out, jumps in, slaps a portable FLASHING RED LIGHT on the dashboard... then speeds off after Milo, a SIREN WAILING! He zig-zags through the crush of other bumper cars in the pavilion. Ned's bumper car catches up with Milo, pulling alongside. Milo turns the wheel, RAMMING Ned! Ned RAMS him back, both bumper cars swerving violently... spraying SPARKS! Ned SLAMS Milo's car again! Milo loses control, spins out and SMASHES into the pavillion railing! Ned swerves to avoid a collision, but RAMS into two other bumper cars, wrenching to a grinding halt. A BEAT. The AIRBAG inflates in his bumper car. Arch runs up as Ned pulls himself from the wreckage. They turn to see Milo leap from his mangled bumper car, leap over the pavillion railing and dash down the pier and into an alley between two buildings. A sign on the building says:}
<ACTION_ALT>__{DEAD END ALLEY.}
<ACTION>__{Ned and Arch eye each other, shake their heads, and follow after Milo.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{OMIT}
<ACTION>__{Sequence  from original script.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{IN THE ALLEY}
<ACTION>__{Milo runs into a tall chain link fence at the end of the alley and scrambles up the wire mesh. Suddenly, Ned's hand shoots out, grabs Milo's ankle, yanking him down hard. Milo jumps to his feet, swinging at Ned, who catches Milo's fist with his hand, stopping it cold... neatly snapping a handcuff on his wrist. He shoves Milo's arm against the fence and snaps the other cuff to the chainlink. A SWITCHBLADE flashes out of Milo's other hand with a sharp CLICK! Milo slashes the blade at Ned, just missing his face. On the backswing, Ned parries with his own switchblade and flips Milo's knife away. Milo pulls a .45 Calibre REVOLVER with his free hand! Ned shoves his finger into the end of the barrel. Milo looks surprised... then sneers, clicking the hammer back.}
<CHAR>__{NED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You take science in high school, Milo?}
<CHAR>__{MILO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I skipped high school, cop!}
<CHAR>__{NED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Then you're probably not familiar with the theory of inverse proportionate explosive dynamics.}
<CHAR>__{MILO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What about it?}
<CHAR>__{NED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{If you fire a weapon with the barrel obstructed, the explosive force multiplies by twenty-three point five nine eight and reverses on itself with diametric polarity?}
<CHAR>__{MILO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah. So?}
<CHAR>__{NED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The gun will blow up in your hand... and it won't even scorch my pinkie.}
<CHAR>__{MILO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Ha! That's just theoretical hypothesis. Inverse proportionate explosive dynamics has never been demonstrated conclusively in a laboratory environment.}
<CHAR>__{NED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh yeah. Then pull the trigger, smart guy. Let's find out.}
<ACTION>__{Milo hesitates, unsure. Finally, he releases the gun. Ned raises it up on the end of his finger. Arch pulls it off with a loud POP! Ned cuffs Milo's hands behind him... spins him around.}
<CHAR>__{NED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You have the right to remain silent... next... if you waive that right, anything you say... next...}

<LOC>__{INT. HOUSE - DAWN}
<ACTION>__{The CAMERA MOVES up the stairs, into the bedroom. Still O.S., we hear more heavy breathing... urgent whispers... lust... passion... squeaky bedsprings! A trail of clothes is scattered before us on the way to the bed... shoes, a dress, slip, bra, nylons, panties... greasy coveralls with a "Frank Kelbo - Mobile Mechanic" namepatch, dirty work boots, a wrench and a gigantic grease gun... The bed shakes violently. A female VOICE calls the shots as various tools drop to the floor.}
<CHAR>__{LANA } <CHAR_PAR>__{(O.S.)}
<DIAL>__{Oh yes, Frank! Adjust the stroke by ten percent! That's it.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(CLUNK! A wrench)}

<ACTION>__{A beat. The LIGHT clicks ON. LANA; a sexy redhead with a cool, manipulative edge, and FRANK; a slick, smarmy Lothario, lay under the sheets, panting, glistening with sweat. Lana reaches for a pack of "Fatal 100's" on the bedside table.}

<ACTION>__{She lights a cigarette... exhales a soft, gloomy cloud.}
<CHAR>__{LANA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{He doesn't. That's why I need you to keep my engine tuned, Frank. Why drive a jalopy when you can have a hot rod?}
<CHAR>__{FRANK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Maybe you should trade him in on a new model.}
<CHAR>__{LANA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<LOC>__{INT. HOUSE - THE KITCHEN - MORNING}
<ACTION>__{Ned enters. Lana wears a diaphanous dressing gown, buttoned unevenly, hair disheveled. She smokes a cigarette.}
<CHAR>__{NED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Morning sweetheart.}
<ACTION>__{Ned kisses her on the back of the neck as he passes through the kitchen on his way to the dining room. She reacts with bored, contemptuous disinterest, picking up the coffee pot.}
<CHAR>__{LANA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Uh huh. Want some coffee?}
<ACTION>__{Ned steps back into the kitchen with his briefcase.}
<CHAR>__{NED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No thanks.}
<ACTION>__{Ned sees Frank sitting at the kitchen table, hair messed up, coveralls hastily pulled on inside-out. Frank is reading a copy of INSURANCE DIGEST magazine. A headline on the cover touts an article: "LIFE INSURANCE FOR YOUR CAT!... Cover All Nine Lives For The Price of One!" Ned's smile fades.}
<CHAR>__{LANA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Frank here was just grabbing a little before going back to work on my car.}

<DIAL>__{I know what he's doing, Lana. I wasn't born yesterday. He's not fixing your car. He's SCREWING you!}
<ACTION>__{Lana tenses up at this. Frank freezes. He figures they've been busted. He sits there, holding the magazine, not moving a muscle... as Ned turns on him.}
<CHAR>__{NED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{YOU are screwing my wife! I can see what your game is, Frank. You open up her hood, poke around in there... squirt some lubrication in... play around with all her parts... then take an old used piston and stick it in... then pull it out... in, out, in, out! Every day! There's no end to it. You just keep coming and COMING!... and the bill just gets bigger and BIGGER!}
<ACTION>__{Lana braces herself against the sink, breathless... turned on by Ned's description. Ned goes to her, sympathetic.}

Frank sweeps the dishes off the table with his arm. Lana leaps into his arms, wrapping her legs around his waist. He lays her down on the kitchen table, standing over her. Suddenly, Ned opens the back door, glaring right at Frank... not even noticing Lana on the table.}
<CHAR>__{NED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Finish your coffee... then GET OUT!}

<ACTION>__{Richly appointed with stately oak, walls lined with law books. As in all "Noir" thrillers, venetian blinds cast dramatic slashes of light and ceiling fans turn lazily in every room. Ned hurries in, rummaging through the files on his desk. LAURA, a strikingly lovely brunette, enters from the outer office, files in hand. She is Ned's astute, dedicated, self- sacrificing "girl-friday" and legal secretary. She keeps his life from spinning crazily apart. She absolutely adores him.}
