<L>__{interior paul's apartment. kitchen same time}
<A>__{finally paul reaches across and picks up the phone.}
<L>__{interior funeral home. upstairs room same time}
<A>__{anna cups her hand around the mouthpiece.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(frenzied whisper)}
<D>__{paul. i'm here.}
<L>__{interior paul's apartment. kitchen same time}
<C>__{anna }
<P>__{(filtered)}
<D>__{help me paul.}
<A>__{anna's hoarse distorted voice sounds almost malevolent. paul's stunned. he stares at the phone as if it was possessed. then slowly puts it down.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{leave me alone.}
<L>__{interior funeral home. upstairs room same time}
<A>__{anna looks at the phone in disbelief. the monotonous tone drones in the ear piece. she doesn't notice eliot appear in the doorway.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{paul.}
<A>__{suddenly the light comes on.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{i'm the only one who can hear you now.}
<A>__{anna drops the phone. backs away towards a window. eliot walks over and calmly replaces the phone.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{i'd be very careful if i were you. the dead have such a hold over the living.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{eliot}
<P>__{(nods to the phone)}
<D>__{he still feels your presence. you're only causing him more pain. if you really loved him, you'd accept your death and let him go.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{then prove to me i'm really dead.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{you people. you always need proof.}
<A>__{eliot places his hands on her shoulders. turns her towards a tall mirror.}
<B>__{on mirror}
<A>__{a pale cadaverous woman. sunken eyes. a blood stained tear in the side of her red slip.}
<B>__{upstairs room}
<A>__{anna's stunned. she moves closer to the mirror. touches her reflection through a thin layer of dust.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{why do i look like a corpse?}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{because you are a corpse.}
<B>__{on mirror}
<A>__{anna stares blankly at her image in the mirror.}
<C>__{eliot }
<D>__{it's time you finally accepted the truth. you are dead. you will never live again.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i am dead.}
<B>__{upstairs room}
<A>__{eliot smiles. like a father proud of his child's first step. just then he notices something outside. we see a brief flicker of unease in eliot's eyes. eliot's pov jack stands in the driveway holding his bicycle. looking up at the funeral home. transfixed.}
