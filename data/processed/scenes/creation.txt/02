<A>__{our pov rotates downwards onto an irregular shape. this shape is grey green and crammed with detail which emerges as we draw close like a continent seen from outer space. a fruit fly lands on it and we now recognise the shape as a patch of lichen. a number of other fruit flies are grazing there. wider. the lichen is on a rock. a black lizard climbs over the horizon stalking flies. a slow advance. a sudden rush. a fly is snapped up and mashed between toothless gums. the lizard is fixing its beady gaze on the next potential victim when... a shadow falls, the lizard tries to flee. a seabird grabs the lizard in its claws. death is sudden and bloody. the bird settles to eat. whizz...thunk. a sharpened stick flies out of nowhere and impales the bird through its wing. the wounded bird falls between boulders, flapping helplessly. the rest of the flock take to their air, calling and wheeling as... a crowd of local savages come racing over the larger horizon of the rocks armed with primitive bows and arrows, spears, rocks and throwing sticks... a child grabs the injured bird and kills it. an adult biffs the child on the head and steals the bird. the rest of the savages leap among the jagged rocks smiting each other, shouting and snarling among the whirling flock of birds.}
