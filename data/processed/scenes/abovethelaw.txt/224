<P>__{(to first agent, advancing)}
<D>__{move!}
<A>__{nico springs from cover, firing, trying to bolt down the garage ramp, toward the lower levels. his path puts the first agent directly in zagon's line of fire. zagon doesn't hesitate; he opens up on nico, cutting down his own man salvano has gotten to his feet, wounded, but still handling his gun. he joins zagon, rushing forward }
