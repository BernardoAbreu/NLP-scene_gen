<L>__{1964. we hear thin, echoey sound as the attorneys question}
<A>__{some of the witnesses. the overall effect is vague and confusing, as is much of the warren report. a mr. ball is questioning lee bowers, the switchman in the railroad yard. bowers, in his early 40's, has a trustworthy, working man face and a crew cut.}
<C>__{bowers}
<D>__{i sealed off the area, and i held off the trains until they could be examined, and there was some transients taken on at least one train.}
<C>__{attorney}
<D>__{mr. bowers... is there anything else you told me i haven't asked you about that you can think of?}
<C>__{bowers}
<D>__{nothing that i can recall.}
<C>__{attorney}
<D>__{witness is excused.}
<A>__{jim, upset, reads on... another witness, sgt. d.v. harkness of the dallas police responds to a second attorney.}
<C>__{sgt. harkness}
<D>__{well we got a long freight that was in there, and we pulled some people off of there and took them to the station.}
<A>__{we see another flashback to the dallas rail yards on the day of the assassination. three hoboes are being pulled off the freight by the dallas policemen.}
<C>__{attorney }
<D>__{you mean some transients?}
<C>__{sgt. harkness }
<D>__{tramps and hoboes.}
<C>__{attorney }
<D>__{were all those questioned?}
<A>__{flashback to dealey plaza an hour or less after the assassination. the three hoboes are marched by shotgun toting policemen to the sheriff's office at dealey plaza. we note that they do not look much like hoboes.}
<C>__{sgt. harkness }
<D>__{yes, sir, they were taken to the station and questioned.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(astounded)}
<D>__{and?}
<P>__{(writes "incomplete")}
<C>__{attorney }
<P>__{(switching subjects)}
<D>__{i want to go back to this amos euins.}
<P>__{(voices dribble off)}
<C>__{bowers }
<D>__{yes sir, traffic had been cut off into the area since about 10, but there were three cars came in during this time from around noon till the time of the shooting... the cars circled the parking lot, and left like they were checking the area, one of the drivers seemed to have something he was holding to his mouth... the last car came in about 7 to 10 minutes before the shooting, a white chevrolet, 4 door impala, muddy up to the windows.}
<A>__{the camera's point of view is now from the railroad tower near dealey plaza. we are fourteen feet off the ground, overlooking the parking lot behind the grassy knoll. the shot includes this last car circling in the lot.}
<C>__{bowers}
<D>__{towards the underpass, i saw two men standing behind a picket fence... they were looking up towards main and houston and following the caravan as it came down. one of them was middle aged, heavyset. the other man was younger, wearing a plaid shirt and jacket.}
<A>__{inside the railroad tower, bowers glances out, busy with the main board, flashing lights, a train coming in.}
<C>__{bowers}
<D>__{there were two other men on the eastern end of the parking lot. each of 'me had uniforms.}
<A>__{we see the parking lot from bower's point of view at a distance, but we have a sense of the cars and see the men at a distance, tow uniformed men. the parking lot is bumper to bumper with a sea of cars. rain that morning has muddied the lot. these brief images are elaborated on later.}
<C>__{bowers}
<D>__{at the time of the shooting there seemed to be some commotion... i just am unable to describe a flash of light or smoke or something which caused me to feel that something out of the ordinary had occurred there on the embankment...}
<A>__{we feel the growing intensity: music, drums but all blurred. we see a puff of smoke but no sound because of the window bowers is glancing through. a motorcycle cop shoots up the grassy knoll incline. people run, blurring into a larger mosaic of confusion. bowers is confused, seeing this.}
