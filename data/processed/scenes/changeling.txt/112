<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{vancouver.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{hop in.}
<A>__{gordon climbs into the truck and goes to shove his bag under the seat...when something metallic bangs underneath. he lifts out a short length of metal pipe.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{don't worry about that, pal. just a little insurance. a couple of guys tried to hijack my truck a few years ago so they could run booze over the border. you can't be too safe, you know?}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{yeah, i surely do.}
<A>__{gordon smiles, moves as if to hand the pipe back...and suddenly slams it down on the driver's head...over and over and over. blood splatters his face. breathing hard, gordon shoves the driver out of the truck into the undergrowth then drives off. changeling a true story}
