<D>__{suffer the little children unto me.}
<A>__{there are three more grave stones, and after clearing away the brush, they too show that the babies died after a few hours, or a day. there's the same symbol on the graves of the children, a cherub of death. we've seen this image before. nell backs out of the cemetery, afraid.}
