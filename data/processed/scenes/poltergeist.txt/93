<A>__{as they come around the corner they run smack into tak, just coming down the last step, rubbing his side.}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<D>__{what happened to you?}
<C>__{tak}
<D>__{i was just about to check out the locked bedroom when... i don’t know... something took a bite out of me.}
<A>__{robbie gets very scared.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{you got bit?}
<C>__{tak}
<D>__{that or the worst muscle spasm in the world.}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<D>__{roll up your shirt. let’s have a look.}
<A>__{tak turns to face the hall light and untucks his shirt, rolling it up. then rolling up his t shirt. everyone crowds in to see. angle tak’s stomach and side teeth marks bear out tak’s story. the unusual thing is, the bite wraps all the way around his side from kidneys to navel. a pink and partially bruised eleven inch crescent impression. close robbie eye level with it, his little mouth hanging open.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{wow!}
<A>__{dr. lesh takes a tentative step up the stairs then turns back demonstratively.}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<D>__{let’s everybody spend the night down here.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{honey, i want you and robbie to come with me. we’ll sleep in town and tomorrow...}
<C>__{diane}
<P>__{(firm and quick)}
<D>__{i’m not leaving carol anne.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{i don’t want to stay here anymore. this place’s got jaws.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{you take robbie into town.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{i’m not leaving you alone in this house.}
