<L>__{interior smoky room day}
<A>__{haeften, olbricht and stauffenberg stand around a table giving their undivided attention to: titles: colonel mertz von quirnheim stauffenberg's}
<B>__{replacement under olbricht.}
<A>__{he empties the contents of two tawny leather briefcases onto the table: along with a crude drawing covered with calculations he produces two brick like lumps wrapped in butcher paper, two small caps and two thin metal cylinders.}
<C>__{mertz}
<D>__{two 975 gram packs of plastic w. enough explosive to cripple a panzer.}
<P>__{(pointing to caps)}
<D>__{your detonators.}
<P>__{(pointing to cylinders)}
<D>__{your fuses. british time pencils. this acid capsule is your trigger.}
<A>__{stauffenberg carefully studies the items before him.}
<C>__{mertz }
<D>__{when you're ready to arm, attach the detonator to the bottom of the time pencil, like so...}
<P>__{(demonstrating)}
<D>__{...insert the entire device into either end of the plastic w, crush the acid capsule and you're live. when the acid eats through the wire holding back the trigger spring... well... you'll want to be very far away.}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{what if they search your bag?}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{i'm one of the inner circle now. they'll make sure i am who i am. beyond that, they won't touch me.}
<P>__{(to mertz)}
<D>__{how much time do i have?}
<C>__{mertz}
<D>__{theoretically there's a 30 minute delay. but with the kind of heat you can expect at the wolf's lair, i'd give you 10, 15 minutes tops.}
<C>__{haeften}
<D>__{that's... hardly precise.}
<C>__{mertz}
<D>__{this is state of the art. you can have small or precise. not both.}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{might this be just a little too small?}
<C>__{mertz}
<D>__{the explosion won't do the killing. the air in the room will.}
<A>__{he points to the drawing an overhead sketch of:}
<C>__{mertz }
<D>__{hitler's bunker is constructed of reenforced concrete. a steel door, no windows. just one of these explosives in a space like that will cause tremendous air pressure.}
<C>__{mertz }
<D>__{enough to instantly kill everyone present. the second charge will be entirely redundant.}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{of course, i'm all for redundancy. however... if, by some miracle, hitler does survive, what then?}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{we have an inside man at the wolf's lair in communications. he'll notify you immediately following the flash and then sever all contact with the outside world.}
<A>__{the others are stunned.}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{just how did you manage that?}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{it's my job, isn't it? while hitler's inner circle is still regrouping, you will initiate valkyrie and seize control in paris and berlin. even if hitler survives, we'll have momentum.}
<C>__{mertz}
<P>__{(to olbricht)}
<D>__{but as you said yourself it would take a miracle. anyone in that bunker when just one of these goes off is not coming out alive.}
<A>__{haeften places the items back in the briefcases.}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{himmler is expected to be at the meeting as well. don't proceed unless you can get them both.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{that could be difficult.}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{why kill a madman just to have a lunatic take his place?}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{this is goerdeler's idea, isn't it?}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{the members are in total agreement on this.}
<A>__{stauffenberg chews on this, pissed. then:}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{fucking politicians. i will hold off if the decision is unanimous. and i want another man on the committee. a soldier.}
<A>__{a soldier himself, olbricht is insulted.}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{and just who this soldier be?}
<A>__{stauffenberg glances at mertz, sizing him, up.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<P>__{(pointing to mertz)}
<D>__{him.}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{him?}
<A>__{mertz's eyes widen. "me?" but stauffenberg and haeften pick up their briefcases and leave without another word. assassins. olbricht reaches for the phone and dials.}
<C>__{olbricht }
<D>__{this is general olbricht. order the guard battalion and all army schools near berlin to take up march readiness. stand by for operation valkyrie.}
<A>__{clack clack clack clack clack...}
