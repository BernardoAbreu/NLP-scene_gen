<L>__{interior gong show set day}
<A>__{barris and some suits watch from the booth as an octogenarian woman on stage sings "born free" in an impossibly high voice. jamie farr gongs the woman. the woman is angry. a vacuous host with great hair appears next to the woman. he seems genuinely agitated.}
<C>__{host}
<D>__{why'd you do that, jamie? this is someone's grandmother. she was really trying.}
<C>__{jamie farr}
<D>__{this is the gong show, not the van cliburn eliminations.}
<C>__{host}
<D>__{this is a human being with aspirations.}
<C>__{barris}
<P>__{(muttering)}
<D>__{oh, fuck me. this guy sucks. he's bringing everyone down.}
<A>__{the executives eye each other.}
<C>__{executive woman}
<D>__{none of the hosts are getting it, chuck. but we have a thought.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{executive woman}
<D>__{you host.}
<A>__{all the executives smile at barris.}
<C>__{executive woman }
<D>__{you get it. and we believe your awkward, non professional, mumbling persona is exactly right for the show.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{i don't want to be on tv.}
<C>__{executive woman}
<D>__{listen, we can't sit through anymore of these test shows. do it, chuck, or we advise the network to pull it.}
