<L>__{exterior laura's rooftop weeks later}
<A>__{alike and laura sit at the edge of the roof sharing a quart of mint chocolate chip ice cream. sunset paints the cityscape pink and orange. the faint cadence of children playing drifts in and out on a fickle breeze. alike's wounds are healing and she seems happy. the friends exchange wordless smiles and soak in the peacefulness around them. laura hears a noise at the door and gets up to investigate. arthur is standing in the doorway. laura calls out to alike. alike looks up and the smile fades from her face. arthur tries to move around laura, but laura stares him down. laura looks back at alike. alike considers, then carefully nods. laura steps out of the way and watches arthur pass. alike rises to face her father. she stands tall, her weight is centered. arthur struggles to find her eyes, and she turns away from him. distant playground voices fill the pause.}
