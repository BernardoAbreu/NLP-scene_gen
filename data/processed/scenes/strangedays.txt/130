<T>__{cut to lenny and mace :}
<A>__{returning to the limo. as they reach the car they are hit by two flashlight beams. it is the two cops, spreg and engelman, out of uniform, but looking very serious with their pistols aimed at lenny and mace. they have been following lenny, knowing sooner or later he would lead them to the tape.}
<C>__{spreg}
<D>__{give me the tape. right now.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{what tape? i'm just trying to get my car back but the place is closed }
<C>__{spreg}
<D>__{shut the fuck up nero.}
<A>__{engelman grabs a fist full of hair at the top of mace's head and jams his 9mm into the back of her skull.}
<C>__{mace}
<P>__{(cool and even)}
<D>__{lenny, give them the tape.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{it's in my case. okay? i'm going to open my case...}
<C>__{engelman}
<D>__{facing us, where we can see it.}
<A>__{lenny slowly opens the haliburton. he takes out the tape and holds it out toward spreg.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{take it and turn her loose. okay?}
<C>__{spreg}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<A>__{and you see in his eyes that it isn't going to go that way. spreg edges forward and takes the tape. then he points his pistol at lenny's head, about to fire which is when the pissed off rottweiller shoots through the open gate like a black torpedo and tears into engelman's leg. engelman screams in pain. mace twists out of his grip. engelman shoots the dog. lenny swings up his haliburton, using it as a shield, and dives for the car. the case takes three rounds from spreg's 9mm before lenny gets behind cover. mace just seems to vanish. she reappears over the trunk of the limo and puts two rounds squarely into spreg's chest, knocking him down. lenny and mace scramble into the car, starting it up. spreg sits up, pulling up his shirt to make sure his body armor stopped the slugs. no blood. he comes up firing. he and engelman empty their magazines at the limo as it pulls away. no damage. they realize the limo is a bullet proof security model and run to their pickup truck, parked nearby, to give chase. spreg's face is a mask of rage. he slams the truck in gear and accelerates after the limo before engelman even has the door closed.}
