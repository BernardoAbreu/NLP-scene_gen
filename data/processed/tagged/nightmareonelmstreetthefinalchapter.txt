<A>__{jacob johnson is sleeping. it doesn't look like a pleasant experience. he is sixteen, dirty blonde, his eyes visibly moving under closed lids as he sits huddle under a blanket in his window seat. the lights are dim the shade on the window closed a bead of sweat dribbles down his forehead. the humming of the jet's engines vibrates through the cabin. the boy's eyes snap open. jacob glances around nervously. he looks like an escaped convict who just accidentally walked into the policemen's ball. a greyhaired man two seats away from him gives the teenager a cursory glance, then goes back to his book. jacob lays his head back and tries to relax. the engines continue to drone. until a new noise starts. a whooshing noise. the sound is very fainterior but distinct from everything else. jacob frowns. the noise gets louder. jacob's sure he's hearing it now. he looks at the greyhaired man. the man catches his eye and the two of them stare at each other for a heartbeat then jacob turns away. the man returns to his book. and jacob immediately turns back to him.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{do you hear that?}

<D>__{that noise.}
<C>__{greyhaired man}
<D>__{i don't hear anything.}
<A>__{the man turns back to the book as the sound gets even louder like it's coming closer. jacob squirms in his seat sneaks a look at the man again. how can he not hear that? a stewardess walks by and jacob catches her attention.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<C>__{stewardess}
<D>__{yes?}
<A>__{the whooshing is completely obvious now. the greyhaired man tries to ignore the two people talking over him.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what is that sound?}
<C>__{stewardess}
<D>__{that's just the engines, sir.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no, it's different. it's not the engines. it's getting louder.}
<A>__{the man sighs the stewardess smiles patronizingly.}
<C>__{stewardess}
<D>__{we're just gaining altitude to get above some rough weather. that's the sound of the engines speeding up a bit. everything's fine.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{um...okay.}
<A>__{the stewardess walks away as jacob sits back and starts to bite his nails. the whooshing is really starting to blare now. he looks between the seats in front of him twists around to look behind. he snaps back to the greyhaired man.}
<C>__{jacob }
<D>__{can't you hear that?}
<C>__{greyhaired man}
<P>__{(losing patience)}
<D>__{look, kid. will you relax? it's just the damn engines, okay?}
<A>__{the man glares at him, and jacob backs off. the sound has grown deafening. jacob grinds his seat like he's going mad. he looks at the closed window. he reaches out his hand, grabs the handle then rips up the shade for all to see: a 747 coming right at us. jacob screams. the planes crash. impact decompression explosion. the hull of the cabin buckles violently moaning like a dying elephant peeling inward revealing red and green striping on the outside. a huge wing section rips through the structure barely missing jacob taking the greyhaired man's head clean off nailing the stewardess in the gut and shoving her body across and out the other side of the cabin. and jacob's seat drops down sending him and us into:}
<L>__{exterior sky night}
<A>__{like an intricate ballet, jacob, his body strapped to his chair, tumbles away from the dc 10 and 747 as they seem to merge and bend into some kind of mutant dc 47 wings and tails wrapping around each other as debris blooms out like a flower and together they explode a fiery ball lighting the nighttime clouds and jacob's shrieking face. and jacob falls and falls and falls, his hair sticking straight up from the blasting wind. that's when corpses start falling past him. the captain of the plane the stewardess, her body bent in half the greyhaired man, his head gone but his book still in his hand. more men, women, crew people and children. but these children aren't dead bodies. two little girls and one little boy, all dressed in white, plummet down next to jacob, head first, like high divers. and they're singing:}
<C>__{the children}
<D>__{one two, freddy's coming for you...}
<A>__{the children turn around in the sky so that they are travelling feet first. the little boy's pants puff up and the girls' skirts poof out and rip upward the wind taking away their clothes and their skin and their bodies and their hair...}
<C>__{the children }
<D>__{three four, better lock your door...}
<A>__{leaving three tiny skeletons taunting and laughing as jacob screams and covers his eyes.}
<C>__{the children }
<D>__{five six, grab your crucifix...}
<A>__{and the skeletons sprout wings leathery and veiny the wind catching them and sending them up and away as their voices echo in the sky.}
<C>__{the children }
<D>__{seven eight, gonna stay up late...}
<A>__{jacob takes his hands away from his face and starts to frantically pull on his seat belt. snap it flies off his back and miraculously turns into a parachute. rope swirls into the air the wind grabs the canvas and jacob's body slows with a violent jerk. but at least he's not falling anymore. jacob catches his breath as he starts gently floating through the sky. he smiles. this isn't so bad. this is actually kind of fun. not for long, though, because his new upward momentum carries him back up to: the winged children's skeletons. jacob's eyes bug out as he rises into them and they start to circle. they move closer and we can see something in their hands:}
<B>__{scissors}
<A>__{jacob twists his body, trying to steer his parachute away from the demons. one of the skeletons swoops up to his face and pokes its scissors inches away from jacob's eyes. it sings alone:}
<C>__{child}
<D>__{nine ten, never sleep again!}
<A>__{the skeleton cranks its arm back ready to plunge the scissor's blades into jacob's sockets. the arms swings toward him then suddenly diverts up past his head, heading for: the chute's strings the skeleton flaps its wings and poises its scissors at one of the ropes. the other two skeletons join it over jacob's head. the three of them look down at jacob, their boney jaws in a perpetual smile.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{the skeletons nod "yes". snip snip snip they cut away at jacob's parachute as he swings underneath them, trying to pull away snip snip. the parachute flutters away the skeletons cackle and jacob plummets.}
<B>__{on jacob}
<A>__{we stay with him as he screams and shrieks and yells and the clouds part and the ground rises quickly up to meet him. the ground becomes a town, the town becomes a block, the block becomes a house, the house becomes a roof, and...}

<A>__{jacob's eyes blast open as he sits up from bed in a cold sweat. a dream. the worst fucking dream from hell anyone would ever want to have but still just a dream. he takes a few deep breaths as a soft knock is heard at the door.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{yeah..}
<A>__{alice johnson opens the door and sticks her head in. she's thirty two, blonde, with a caring smile.}

<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{on my way.}
<A>__{alice closes the door as jacob gets out of bed and stretches. sunlight is leaking through the bedroom window shade and jacob walks over to it. he reaches out and pulls up the shade. and there's nothing buy sky. jacob frowns and pokes his head out the window. jacob's pov the ground is once again racing up towards us at seven thousand miles an hour. the entire house is falling.}
<B>__{back in the bedroom}
<A>__{jacob leaps away from the window. the winged skeletons reappear outside dancing in the air cackling with glee. the bedroom starts to shake violently as jacob stumbles into the center. the roof starts caving in and the walls begins to crumble.}

<B>__{angle straight down on the house}
<A>__{as it falls away towards the ground. we watch as it becomes a small dot and finally impacts on the surface. a mushroom cloud of smoke silently puffs out in the distance below}
<L>__{exterior town night at the crater}
<A>__{smoke and dust whirl around a huge hole in the earth. splintered shreds of lumber stick up in the air like giant toothpicks. some of the toothpicks start to move. jacob rises out of the destruction, charred, scraped, battered and, unfortunately, alive. he climbs up to the edge of the crater. he looks back a the remnants of his home. then something starts to happen. something his growing from the crater spreading out. it's not a cloud, it's not smoke it's a darkness. even though it's night, this darkness is darker. it creeps out from the hole fingers of blackness reaching out. what it covers doesn't disappear. it becomes gloomy. the shroud is getting bigger. and it's getting faster. jacob runs. with jacob running he bolts down the streets of the small town in a blind panic. he looks behind him and sees the darkness getting bigger, its gloominess covering houses. then whole blocks. everything it touches seems to fall deeper into shadow.}
<B>__{at the street corner}
<A>__{jacob comes across a woman walking her dog. he stops and yells at her.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{get the hell out of here! it's coming!}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{what's coming?}
<A>__{jacob points down the street. the shroud is swooping down the road browning out street lights in its wake. and the woman doesn't find anything threatening about this. jacob screams at her.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{don't you see it?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{see what?}
<A>__{and it's obvious now: she doesn't see anything. the woman is totally oblivious to the danger. jacob shakes his head stumbles away. the woman watches him go as the darkness passes over her. she sighs. and begins to mutate. her hair gets scraggly, her skin bursts out in sores, her back grows a hump all of which she doesn't seem to notice. she just shrugs her twisted shoulders.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{kids...watcha gonna do?}
<A>__{she hobbles away with her dog which now has six legs and two heads. back with jacob running like a bat running from hell, he tears through the streets passing buildings that turn creepy and people that become passively accepting monsters. a voice booms out from nowhere.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{jacob! you're too old to run away from home!}
<A>__{jacob covers his ears and races out of town.}
<L>__{exterior highway night}
<A>__{jacob falls onto the deserted road just outside of town. he rolls on the asphalt and looks behind him. most of the town is covered in an opaque gloom. suddenly a cackling sound is heard and jacob turns to its source: his pov: the springwood sign the town can still be seen behind it the darkness over almost all of it now. the sign reads: welcome to springwood.}
<B>__{population...}
<A>__{and the numbers after the word "population" are changing. they're counting backwards, clattering away like an old time gas pump in reverse faster and faster blurring as the "thousands" digit disappears, then the "hundreds", then "tens", then... clink the count stops at "1". springwood is entirely engulfed in the shroud. there is a pause. crash the sign is violently yanked into the ground. it vanishes into the earth and a crack appears at the edge of the road. the crack grows moving out to the center of the highway.}
<B>__{back on the street}
<A>__{jacob watches the crack as it splits wider in the middle of the street and a gurgling sound starts to build. the tar in front of jacob becomes molten. it bubbles and pops. jacob scrambles backwards as something begins to rise from boiling asphalt. it's a hat. the hat, a fedora to be precise, pushes itself up. a left hand burned and scarred pokes out next to it. four sharp blades jut out of the muck on the other side. a head is up now a curtain of tar dripping from the rim of the hat hiding the face. the body beneath the head ascends. the veil of asphalt parts: it's freddy krueger. jacob screams. freddy laughs. he shakes off his layer of tar and looks towards the clouded town of springwood. a look of pure hatred appears on his ragged face.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{payback time...}
<A>__{freddy opens his mouth lets out a large breath and then inhales an even larger one. a windstorm starts, the source being krueger's own lungs. the gale force begins to yank at the shroud surrounding springwood. fingers of darkness pull up from the town and towards freddy's mouth and houses begin to dissolve. freddy continues to inhale like he's never going to stop. krueger is sucking the black gloom into his body and the entire town of springwood is going with it. trees, buildings, cars, picket fences. it's all crumbling and fusing, becoming a part of t cloud that itself is caught in the nightmarish wind tunnel, all piling into freddy's mouth. the vortex swirls into krueger. then it's gone. nothing but a vacant lot the size of a town remains. freddy turns to jacob and burps, it sounds like a thunderclap.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{don't worry, i have a strong stomach.}
<A>__{freddy reaches down and yanks up his red and green sweater. he pulls apart his putrid abdomen to reveal his guts and a transparent stomach. inside the stomach: a black swirling mass. flashes of houses, people, homes, couples, all trapped in horrible anguish. freddy drops down his sweater.}

<D>__{springwood is mine, boy!}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i dreamed you away before i was born! mom said you couldn't come back!}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{is that true? then she told you all about me, huh? let's see what else she has to say.}
<A>__{freddy reaches his left hand into the bubbling tar at his feet, digs around a bit, then pulls out: alice. jacob's mother. tar dripping down her body. krueger has her by the neck, waves his blades in front of her. jacob gets up and runs toward him. freddy pulls a foot up from the asphalt pit and kicks jacob back a good fifteen feet.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{run, jacob!}
<A>__{the boy rolls painful on the hard road. he sits up and screams:}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{leave her alone!}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{you're such a momma's boy!}
<A>__{freddy swings his knives out, pauses for a terrifying beat, then swoops the daggers towards alice.}
<B>__{close on jacob}
<A>__{as off screen we hear a horrible multiple glitch! jacob shrieks in gut wrenching anguish.}
<B>__{wide on scene}
<A>__{we're far enough away so that we don't barf at the sight but close enough to see that freddy has impaled alice's body on his blades. he lifts her up effortlessly and raises her limp figure right over his head. krueger swings his arm out, shaking off alice, sending her flying over jacob's head. the body lands behind him.}
<B>__{on jacob}
<A>__{as he runs to his mother. she vanishes just as he reaches out to touch her bloody body. he turns to krueger and raises his fists. a look of sheer rage is growing in him, blind, insane anger. he bellows:}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you fucker!}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{springwood is only the beginning. all i need from you is a ride!}
<A>__{suddenly, between jacob and freddy, three shafts of light burst up from the road. three figures appear as the light dissipates. they're dressed in metallic black, heavy boots, helmets with dark visors covering their faces. one is large and muscular. the one in the center has an obviously feminine figure under her skin tight outfit. the third is a little smaller than the other two with a slightly different face that allows us to see his mouth. they're the dream police. jacob doesn't know this yet, but freddy seems to. the bastard son of a hundred maniacs frowns at the sight of these new apparitions. then he looks past them and smiles at jacob.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{see ya later!}
<A>__{freddy violently drops down into the bubbling asphalt pit. two of the black figures start after him. the third one turns to jacob as his partners leap into the hole after freddy. the sound from his exposed mouth is deafening!}

<L>__{exterior highway day}
<A>__{jacob's eyes snap open so fast his sockets suffer whiplash. he's lying smack in the middle of the road tucked in a fetal position. jacob slowly uncurls his body and sits up. he shivers and wipes his sweaty forehead and that's when he notices something in his hand. insert: jacob's hand it's a bracelet, a simple band of gold with a larger plate in the middle, like an id band. jacob's fingers turn the plate over. printed on the other side is the name of the bracelet's former owner: alice. jacob has a souvenir.}
<B>__{back to jacob}
<A>__{he raises his face and looks at the road in front of him. it goes off into the distance surrounded on both sides by empty fields. this is where springwood used to be. a look of anguish crosses jacob's face as he stares at the desolation.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{mom...}
<A>__{honk! screech! jacob whips his head around in time to see a huge moving van blasting right at him. he rolls off to the side of the road. the truck barely misses him, kicking up a cloud of dust in its wake. jacob chokes on the dust. he slowly recovers and looks back down at the bracelet in his hand. he clenches his fist around it as a wild eyed angry look starts to grow on him. he takes a few deep breaths, then stands up and walks out of frame.}
<B>__{angle down the highway}
<A>__{we can see a pickup truck in the distance. jacob's hand enters frame, thumb sticking out, his mother's bracelet dangling from his wrist. the pickup truck starts to slow down.}
<L>__{exterior rosedale day}
<A>__{a sprawling little community with pleasant streets and cheerful houses. it looks a lot like springwood, the only real difference being that it actually exists. it also has a sign: welcome to rosedale. population: 8,786 a volkswagon bus drives past the sign and stops a couple of blocks down the road from us. jacob steps out of the passenger side and wearily waves his ride goodbye. he shuffles into town.}
<B>__{close on yet another sign}
<A>__{it reads: drug addicts not welcome to rosedale! the sign pulls away to reveal a middle aged man with an angry expression: mr. hopkins}

<B>__{on jacob}
<A>__{we catch him walking down the sidewalk. he tramps along with his hands stuffed in his pockets and his eyes on the pavement. he looks like he hasn't slept in days. the sound of the crowd ahead of him finally grabs his attention. jacob approaches the disturbance and comes across a young girl standing behind a bush holding a bag of groceries. she is karen miller, dark hair, sixteen, very pretty, but with a faraway look in her eyes. jacob stands next to her and stares at the crowd like a zombie. she doesn't turn to look at him as he speaks:}

<B>__{in front of the house}
<A>__{karen quickly makes her way into the crowd of people, head up, eyes staring forward. the crowd parts ever so slightly as the irked townsfolk start to heat up. they have an actual human to vent their anger on now. mr. hopkins lays in on her as she passes him.}

<D>__{why can't you find somewhere else to shack up?}

<A>__{he shuts his eyes tensely as the sound is magnified, becoming a sudden roar that fills the room. wesley blinks his eyes open, looks around from his blanket cocoon. whatever that last sound was, it did not come from the tv. beads of sweat line his upper lip as he nervously glances about the room. it remains quiet, serene. deciding it was his imagination reacting to the scene on tv, wesley nestles back on the couch, laying down now as the camera moves to}
<B>__{reveal}
<A>__{the carpet at the edge of the room is bunched up as though the walls of the room itself have budged a few inches inward. back on the tv the second orderly lights his cigarette as he hands the pack to the first. they both look down at the madman as they savor their cigarettes.}

<D>__{you heard the man, wesley. just relax. have a smoke with us.}

<A>__{as they hold their smokes out toward us, their arms protrude from the tv set with their lit cigarettes. wesley screams and jerks his head away from tv and he hits the floor with an ugly thump. the wind knocked out of him. he rolls. the couch is gone. as he squirms and struggles to escape his white cocoon, the frightened boy looks around and sees that everything in the room furniture, carpet, tv, even the door are all gone, leaving just the white walls slowly closing in on him. then we see that on the floor all around wesley are long, cylindrical white objects. clearly, they resemble giant cigarettes, and wesley wrapped neck to toe in his white blanket cocoon looks just like one of them. he continues to squirm and scream as the walls close in from all sides closer closer pushing the long white things toward him, around him, bunching them together until they are in a tight cluster, as the room crunches in tightly, blocking whatever light source there is, until all wesley can do is scream one last time, and the screen goes black. after a few beats, we hear a huge, deafening ripping sound, and a new light source appears as wesley looks up, eyes wide with unspeakable horror as the giant, scarred face of freddy looms over him, grinning, and we:}

<A>__{freddy looks around, as if searching for something, then beams as he reaches into the air and...}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{ah! a match made in heaven!}
<A>__{he produces a puny version of wesley's father in one hand. his body is straight and rigid, like a match stick. freddy places his thumb on the stiff man's head, and flicks his thumbnail, causing the man's skull to burst into flame, an evil grin spanning wesley's father's face. he brings the father match to what would be wesley's tiny feet, and lights the end. very close on freddy's hand wesley screams as freddy tosses the father match and brings the teenager's little head up to his fire scarred lips. the boy is enveloped by the massive cracked opening as freddy takes a huge drag off of wesley's head. where his feet should be, the tip of the wesley cig glows red, causing wesley to scream with supernatural pain. smoke billows from freddy's nose and mouth. he savors it.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{ahhhh! now we're smokin'!}
<A>__{he cackles horribly as he continues to suck on the wesley cig. with each puff, wesley's white wrapped body becomes slat black ash.}

<D>__{what's your sign, wesley? it wouldn't be cancer, would it?}
<A>__{in between his demonic cackles, freddy drags on the wesley cig, each puff turning more of wesley into ash until all but his head is black and charred. freddy holds the wesley cig out, poised to tap the ashes loose.}

<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{fire marshall}
<D>__{that's where bodies are supposed to go up in smoke for no reason. it's all psychic bullshit. what really happened is called the candle effect. a tiny fire gets started, usually from a cigarette. it slowly smolders through the blanket and clothes until the skin starts to actually bake. the body fat begins to melt and liquefy, fueling the fire like a slow burning candle. it takes hours, but it's real.}

<A>__{and blade becomes airborne putting a samurai to shame, twirling her legs up and out as a blade juts momentarily from her right heel, chopping off freddy's left hand. krueger stumbles back in astonishment as green goo spurts out of the stump. astonishment turns to rage as the two converge again, swinging away at an incredible rate. an impossible rate. jacob rounds the corner. he stumbles into the action just as the battling pair are becoming an obscure swirling glinting mass. pieces of them start to drop away. blade's foot hits the ground. freddy's arm plops away. a broken sword hits the asphalt under the spinning cloud, then one of blade's arms.}
<B>__{close on jacob}
<A>__{as he watches, his eyes dart to try to follow the action that's moving too fast for him to see. then there's silence. we pull back and pan to follow jacob as he walks into the scene of carnage. he steps up to two pills of remains: one black and flesh colored covered with red blood, the other a heap of red and green cloth, scarred tissues, and pukish green glop. blade and freddy have literally chopped each other to bits, the two mounds of body parts steaming in the cold night air. jacob sees something else and walks over to it. it's scott's body. jacob kneels down next to the dead teenager.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i'm sorry, scott.}
<A>__{a cracking sound makes jacob stand up. over to the now silent bar entrance a black fist punches up through the cement. with a crumbling of granite, power cop rises from the earth. something else moves behind jacob and he turns, then screams. sound cop's headless body walks into the shot, his arms held above frame over his neck. then sound cop's arms lower his dismembered head onto his stump, push it down, twist it til it stays. with great effort, sound cop yanks the brick out of his mouth. jacob now looks off screen at something else, something that really makes his eyes widen. we get to see the shadow of what jacob sees, projected on the wall of the bar behind him. the shadow of the pile of body parts that was blade cop begins to move. the pieces start to reform, leg to torso, arm to shoulder, head to neck. the shadow on the wall rises and we pull back. blade cop stands across from jacob, whole again except for a flash of exposed flesh on her abdomen to remind her of the experience. jacob raises his eyebrows as the resurrected dream police step around him.}
<C>__{jacob }
<D>__{okay, i'm impressed}
<A>__{blade whips her visor up to reveal an upset girl's face.}
<C>__{blade cop}
<D>__{you shouldn't be.}
<A>__{jacob frowns as the four of them walk over to the pile of freddy remains. but they're not remains anymore. all that's left of freddy is a stack of cloth remnants. a wind rises and pieces of cloth blow away into the darkness. the other two dream police raise their visors, looking equally distraught. they all face jacob.}
<C>__{blade cop }
<D>__{this is what we were afraid of.}
<C>__{sound cop}
<D>__{he still exists.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what! how?}
<C>__{power cop}
<D>__{we're already dead, that's why he couldn't destroy us.}
<C>__{blade cop}
<D>__{but he's not dead. he's not alive either. he's something in between.}

<D>__{he's not entirely part of reality or part of dreams. he's unique.}
<C>__{blade cop}
<D>__{we can't kill him.}

<C>__{sound cop}
<D>__{you have to.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{how the hell am i supposed to do that?}
<C>__{blade cop}
<D>__{krueger's power comes from his rage and the souls of children.}
<C>__{power cop}
<D>__{you have to find the original source of that rage and use it against him.}
<C>__{blade cop}
<D>__{this town in its present condition encompasses all evils from all times in its history. the answer is here somewhere...}
<A>__{jacob sighs, then gets an idea.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i think i know where...}
<A>__{and he starts to run down the street.}
<C>__{blade cop}
<D>__{jacob, wait. we have to find him first.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no time. you guys find karen!}
<A>__{he disappears down the road as the dream police snap down their visors}
<L>__{exterior elm street house}
<A>__{karen stands in front of a rotted gate in front of a run down building with shuttered windows and a crumbling foundation. this isn't just an elm street house, it's the elm street house. and for some reason karen is drawn to it. she looks to her let at the bent mailbox. it has a name plate on it. another one underneath it. and another. it's as if people moved in and out and instead of changing the plates on the mailbox, they just whacked a new one over the old. karen steps closer to the mailbox. the little sign on the top reads williams. she touches it with her finger and it drops off, the nails holding it on rusted away to dust. a new plate is revealed. this one says thompson. karen picks lightly at it, and it swings away. the name underneath makes karen gasp. it reads krueger. and there's still another one under that horrible name. karen quickly hits the krueger plate off. the last sign reads underwood. karen frowns. she turns back to the house, a determined expression on her face.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{no more...}
<A>__{she kicks the gate open and walks up to the house.}
<L>__{interior elm street house}
<A>__{we've been here before, haven't we? but for karen it's the first visit as she opens the front door and walks in. she takes in the twisted skeleton of a home for a few seconds and then begins to search it.}

<A>__{karen races through, pulling open desk drawers, rifling through shelves, flipping through books. she doesn't know what she's looking for, but she knows she hasn't found it yet.}

<L>__{interior elm street house master bedroom}
<A>__{karen flings the door open. nothing but a bed and a set of drawers. no hint as to the occupant's lives. she doesn't bother ransacking this one and goes on to:}
<L>__{interior elm street house freddy's bedroom}
<A>__{jackpot. karen stares through the open door at a child's room, a very twisted child's room. she slowly walks in. a bed, a desk, a dresser. there's a jack in a box with its head torn off. a disemboweled teddy bear. white puffy guts hanging out of it. a clown doll with its face caved in. a hanging mobile made of strange bent shapes. and a pile of more than dirty clothes. karen goes over to the pile and picks through it with her toe. a small pair of pants, about the right size for an eight year old. a black pair of shoes. and a little sweater, a red and green striped sweater. karen goes over to the desk. there is stack of drawings on it a child's drawings. on one of them it looks like someone was practicing writing their name. freddy unnerwood, freddy underwud, freddy underwood over and over again. until the final attempt has the last name angrily crossed out, replaced underneath by a hastily scrawled krueger!!! another piece of paper: a set of human stick figures. a small one is labeled freddy. the large one is labeled daddy. the daddy figure is depicted hitting the freddy figure. there are more drawings, all of them violent, the large figure beating away at the small one. suddenly a creaking. karen jumps. hides behind a bookshelf. she's nervously trying to figure out what to do when a framed picture catches her attention on the shelf. it's a picture of a tall, dark man and a little boy. karen reaches out to grab the picture, but accidentally knocks over a glass mug with a crash. footsteps can now be heard tromping up the stairs. someone's coming and karen's on the edge of panic. she looks around and finds an old baseball bat. she grabs it and runs to the side of the doorway as the footsteps approach down the hallway. karen raises the bat. and jacob appears. karen pulls back with the bat as jacob jumps away from her.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{jacob! you scared the shit out of me!}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{the feeling is mutual.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{where are the dream police?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i told them to look for you. what are you doing here? don't you know what this place is?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i do now. look what i found.}
<A>__{she starts to drag him over to the desk of drawings.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you've got to get out of here.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{wait. you have to see this.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you don't understand. the police can't kill freddy. they literally chopped each other to pieces and he's still alive! now i'm supposed to figure out how to get rid of him.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{but i think i found the answer. shut up for a second and look at these.}
<A>__{she starts showing him the scrawlings.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{okay, so he's a bad artist.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{no! you told me krueger's mother committed suicide and no one knows who his father was, right?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{freddy's been pushing all our buttons with our pasts. these are his past. don't you get it? he was a foster child, too!}
<A>__{she walks over to the bookshelf and grabs the picture of little freddy and freddy's foster father.}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{someone had to have taken care of him. this guy...he was freddy's father. those drawings...they were freddy's childhood. this house...it's where it all happened.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{but in reality freddy hasn't lived here for decades.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{like you tried to tell me once before, this is a dream. who knows why this is all here.}

<D>__{all evils from all times in history...}

<D>__{and isn't this where it all started in springwood? on elm street?}
<A>__{jacob thinks for a second. it's all starting to make sense.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{but what does this do for us?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{there's got to be a way to use it against him.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{okay, but we're not going to stand around here to figure out how. it's too dangerous.}
<A>__{he grabs her hand and pulls her towards her door.}
<C>__{jacob }
<D>__{let's get out of this house.}
<A>__{they head out to}
<B>__{upstairs hallway}
<A>__{and blade cop is standing in the middle of the corridor. the two teenagers stop.}
<C>__{jacob }
<D>__{thank god. freddy's going to show up any minute.}
<A>__{kachink! a knife shoots out of blade's right hand, ready for action. (but wait a minute, her uniform isn't ripped anymore...) karen and jacob make their way to the stairs. he turns to blade.}
<C>__{jacob }
<D>__{where are the others?}
<A>__{blade walks up to him and stands there. then jams her knife into jacob's gut. karen screams. jacob chokes. blade cop shoves the knife in further until it juts out of jacob's back. she turns. then becomes freddy.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{time to join your mommy.}
<A>__{krueger yanks his finger blades out and jacob's limp body falls at karen's feet. karen shrieks and cries, dropping to her knees to hold him.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{no no no no no no no...jacob...}

<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{young love...ha!}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{karen...dream...powers....}
<A>__{and jacob is gone. karen sobs, so torn apart that she is ignoring the incredible danger above her. but not for long. krueger grabs karen by the neck.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{it's past your bedtime, young lady.}
<A>__{and he starts to drag her, kicking and screaming, her body scraping across the floor towards the}
<B>__{master bedroom}
<A>__{freddy drags karen in and tosses her across the room. she lands with a thud on the bed. he saunters over to her and climbs up on the bed next to her. gets on top. karen yells and hits him uselessly with her fists and it's horrible because there he is, pressing down on her, right in her face, mounting her as if he's going to rape her.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{aw, sweetheart. this won't hurt a bit.}
<A>__{she screams as he presses even harder.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{come on. be daddy's little girl.}
<A>__{and the last three words of that sentence seem to echo through the room, swirling around karen. daddy's little girl. "daddy's little girl." karen twists her head away. and freddy's become karen's father. he looks down on her with a lecherous grin.}
<C>__{karen's father}
<D>__{that's my baby. that's daddy's little girl.}
<A>__{karen stops struggling. the realization grows on her face with the resurfacing memory.}

<C>__{karen's father}
<D>__{but we're going to have the same fun!}
<A>__{karen stares at him defiantly. and a hand grabs karen's father, and yanks him away. we pull back. karen's mother is next to the bed. furious.}
<C>__{karen's mother}
<D>__{that's enough!}
<A>__{and she slaps karen's father. he stands up, slugs her across the jaw. she tumbles back. karen sits up.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{mommy, no!}
<A>__{karen's mother gets up, a defiant look just like karen's on her face.}
<C>__{karen's mother}
<D>__{you're never going to touch her again!}
<C>__{karen's father}
<D>__{i will touch what i want!}
<A>__{bap! he strikes her again, sending her right out the door. he follows her. karen stands up and runs after them.}
<B>__{in the hallway}
<A>__{crack! the man hits the woman down to the floor. karen's mother stands up, just taking it. she's at the top of the stairs. karen's father swings his arm back, and karen jumps on him. he shrugs her away violently.}
<B>__{with karen}
<A>__{as she hits the ground and the wall next to jacob's body. she looks up.}
<B>__{wider}
<A>__{and karen's father is now freddy again. he swings his fist. smack! karen's mother reels from the hit, falls backwards. karen jumps up to try and help her, reaching past freddy. but it's too late. karen's mother tumbles down the stairs, head hitting, bones cracking, disappearing into darkness. freddy grabs karen by the neck and lifts her. dangles her over the top of the steps.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{be honored, bitch. you're the last soul i need.}
<A>__{and jacob rises up behind krueger. grabs him. freddy drops karen. she hits hard and rolls down the steps as freddy turns, his knives swinging out and slamming jacob's gut one more time, impaling him against the wall. jacob gasps out his final breath.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i will be back...}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{i will be waiting.}
<A>__{freddy pulls his blades out of jacob and the wall. the boy's body hits the floor for the last time. freddy turns back to the stairs and looks down them.}

<B>__{downstairs hallway}
<A>__{freddy walks down and no one's there. karen's mom was just an illusion, but karen herself, dead or alive, is nowhere to be seen.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{play time is over, bitch.}

<C>__{voice}
<D>__{frederick!}
<A>__{freddy cocks his head and frowns.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{frederick! what have you done?}
<A>__{and, amazingly, a look of fear crosses krueger's face. something about that voice has struck terror in the heart of the creature that fears nobody. krueger turns to the kitchen door. a man steps out of the shadows, a big muscular man with a horrifying look in his eyes. a man we've seen somewhere before in a picture. it's freddy's foster father mr. underwood. and he looks pissed beyond belief. freddy shrinks back, eyes widening.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{daddy?}
<C>__{mr. underwood}
<D>__{don't you "daddy" me!}
<A>__{mr. underwood raises his arm and smacks freddy across the skull. krueger tumbles back into the hallway. freddy scrambles to his feet. shakes with dread. looks like a scared little boy. mr. underwood advances on him.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{no, daddy. please...}
<A>__{freddy turns and bolts for the front door. he flings it open. power cop stands in his way and shoves freddy back back in front of his foster father. punch a vicious blow from underwood sends krueger into}

<A>__{where freddy falls over a couch. underwood stomps into the room. krueger scrambles up and heads for the archway leading into the dining room. blade cop blocks the escape. the ripped flap of her uniform proving she's the real one. she kicks freddy back and into underwood's hands. the man picks up krueger and hits him again. and again. and again.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{stop. you're hurting me. stop.}
<A>__{freddy wriggles away and opens a window. sound cop fills the window, cutting him off. pushes him back inside. mr. underwood grabs krueger and slaps him over and over. slugs him. gives the beating he's got coming to him. and freddy moans and yells like a blubbering child. shrinks into a corner but is yanked out for more pummeling. power cop stands at the exit to the hallway. blade cop continues to obstruct the dining room arch. sound cop steps through the window and stands in front of it. the dream police just stare in silence. it's not a street fight, not a punching match. just a ruthless thrashing that would be hard to watch if it weren't for the fact that we are all cheering because no one in history has ever deserved it more. underwood stops the whipping and stands over krueger who is lying on the ground whimpering, pleading for mercy.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{why, daddy? what did i do?}
<C>__{mr. underwood}
<D>__{you took some things that don't belong to you!}
<A>__{and with that, underwood brings his fist down and jams it into freddy's stomach. right through it. shoving it into his very body. freddy screams. underwood violently pulls his fist out and there's something in it. a shimmering flowing thing. crackling with unworldly light. it's a soul. it's wesley's soul. underwood flings his arm out and lets go. wesley's soul flies into thin air and dissipates. krueger's father brings his hand down again and rips out gina's soul. again. jacob's soul. freddy opens his mouth and shrieks. as underwood raises his arms and begins to sparkle. flashes of light bounce around his body. he's changing. and something's happening to freddy's too. steam is rising from the creature. his feet are starting to flatten as he lays on the ground and black goo oozes from his pores. he's melting. and still screaming as he watches his foster father's image turn into: karen. an aura of light vanishes around her body as she lowers her arms with a victorious yet sad look on her face. freddy dies. a look of horrified realization burns in krueger's eyes as he sees karen and continues to scream inhumanly. his body dissolves, all of it liquefying into black slime. gone. just a bubbling black puddle of gunk is left. his shriek echoes through the room and everywhere else. then the gunk grows and changes into a dark cloud that begins to expand. power cop runs up, grabs karen and yells.}
