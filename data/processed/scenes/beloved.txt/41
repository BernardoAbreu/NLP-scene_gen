<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{here?! out in the open?!}
<C>__{halle}
<D>__{look around can you see anybody?}
<A>__{sethe looks and can see nothing through the corn stalks. she shakes her head no.}
<C>__{halle}
<D>__{then nothing can see us neither.}
<A>__{he takes off his shirt. seethe giggles as she gets on the ground, keeping her ankles crossed. halle lays her back and gently separates her legs. she giggles. halle pauses before laying on top of her.}
<C>__{halle}
<D>__{you are a beautiful sight.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{don't talk stupid.}
<C>__{halle}
<D>__{you're my wife now! i can talk as stupid as i like about you!}

<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{we're gonna have us a liiife..}
<A>__{he sings the word "life", so that sethe laughs. then, halle lowers himself slowly to her and they begin to make love. as camera pans up to a hill above the field, we hear sethe ask;}
<C>__{sethe }
<D>__{you sure nobody can see?}
<A>__{we hear halle grunt "uh huh" as we arrive on the hill where a great tree sits.}
