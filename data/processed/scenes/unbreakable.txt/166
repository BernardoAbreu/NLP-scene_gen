<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior pool night}
<A>__{david lands on his stomach with a tremendous slap onto the nylon black tarp. there's a thin layer of rain water on the tarp's surface. david is laying on his cheek. half his face is covered in water. beat. david's exposed eye looks around in a daze. the surface of the tarp gets pounded by the rain. david uses his hands to push his body off the tarp. his hands sink into the water as his pressure pushes the tarp down.}
<B>__{the first sounds of nylon sliding against concrete start.}
<A>__{david stops pushing. his vision catches the corner of the swimming pool as the tarp slides out from under the sand bags that hold it in place. the tarp sags. david becomes utterly still. the sound continues anyway. one by one the tarp starts sliding out from under the sand bags all around the edge of the pool. and then without warning, the tarp caves in. it folds around david as he and the tarp get pulled under the cold dark water.}
