<L>__{interior harry's beachcomber night}
<A>__{on the tv, dr. pretorius (played by ernest thesiger) delivers a toast with inimitably ripe enunciation: "to a new world of gods and monsters!" dwight and harry and betty all laugh.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{these old movies are such a hoot. they thought they were being scary, but they're just funny.}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(defensively)}
<D>__{maybe it's supposed to be funny.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{funny is funny and scary is scary. you don't mix them.}
<A>__{suddenly the tinny tv soundtrack is drowned out by the voice of elvis presley. kid saylor bends over the jukebox, wagging his denim butt and tapping a high top sneaker.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{hey! some of us are watching a movie!}
<C>__{saylor}
<D>__{go ahead. free country.}
<A>__{clay jumps from his stool. saylor sees him coming, steps aside.}
<C>__{saylor}
<D>__{you want me to turn it down?}
<A>__{clay slams the heel of his hand against saylor's chest. the boy staggers backward. clay grabs the corner of the jukebox and jerks it from the wall; the needle scratches across the song. saylor holds up both hands in a nervous surrender.}
<C>__{saylor}
<D>__{hey, i didn't know. it's your favorite movie. sorry, okay?}
<A>__{clay returns to the bar and uprights the stool. saylor escorts his girl to the door.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you're like a dog with a bone over this movie, clay.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i just want to watch it, okay?}
<A>__{on the tv, the blind man thanks god for sending him a friend.}
