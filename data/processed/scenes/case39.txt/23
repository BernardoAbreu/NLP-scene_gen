<L>__{interior detective barron's office, police station night}
<A>__{detective mike barron. veteran of the force. man of quiet faith. a well built silver haired family man who played fullback at brigham young. he's doing paperwork. smiles warmly as emily enters.}
<C>__{barron}
<D>__{was just thinking about you, got a nice letter from sandy hutchinson...}
<A>__{she drops lucy's file on his desk. whatever barron was going to say is no longer relevant. soberly, after a pause:}
<C>__{barron}
<D>__{well, it's sitting in front of me which means our good friend wayne thinks it fails to meet the criteria for child endangerment and has told you in no uncertain terms to leave it alone...?}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{surprise, surprise.}
<A>__{she starts to open the file. barron stops her.}
<C>__{barron}
<D>__{i can't, emily. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{mike, i'm desperate here.}
<A>__{tense beat. the need for privacy now apparent, barron gets up and closes his door. sits down at his desk again.}
<C>__{barron}
<D>__{you know how dear to my heart the work you do is, but the department doesn't pay me to stakeout potential child abusers. last time almost cost me my job.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{this girl heard her parents say they're going to send her to hell.}
<C>__{barron}
<D>__{sickening as that is, you're a part of the system that handles those situations, i'm not.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{the system is broken.}
<C>__{barron}
<D>__{maybe you just need to let it work.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{what? jesus, i feel like i'm talking to wayne. you don't want to get involved, fine, but don't bullshit me, i'm running out of people i respect.}
<C>__{barron}
<D>__{okay. no bullshit. give me evidence of a crime, i will be all over it. till then there's nothing i can do.}
