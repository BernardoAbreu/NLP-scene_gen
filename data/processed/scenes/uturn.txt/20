<D>__{not eat. drink. what the fuck is drink in spanish ... uh, agua?}
<A>__{the old woman's eyes widen. she starts to scream, but quickly clamps her hands over her mouth. for a moment bobby thinks the woman is screaming at what he has said. then, as if he feels a presence behind him, bobby turns slowly to face the two tough looking, unshaven, tattoo covered bikers. one holds a gun.}

<C>__{biker }
<D>__{...he doesn't have to give me the bag.}
<A>__{the biker grabs bobby's bag. bobby flinches in anticipation of a shot but refuses to let go of the bag. the biker swings the gun hard, clipping bobby across the forehead. bobby falls against the counter and to the floor. the woman starts to scream. the biker grabs up the pack, then, looking back at the woman, sees a ring on her finger. he grabs her hand and pulls at the ring. the woman screams wildly.}
<C>__{second biker}
<D>__{let's go, man.}
<C>__{biker}
<D>__{a little extra never hurt, benji, would you just relax.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{no! no! my wedding ring.}
<A>__{he pulls the ring from the woman's finger and pushes her back. with bobby's bag slung over his shoulder he turns to leave.}
<C>__{biker}
<D>__{now we go.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{you go to el diablo!}
<A>__{from beneath the counter the woman pulls a shotgun. the woman fires a shot that rips through the bag and into the back of the biker. he falls to the ground, very dead, amid a shower of blood and shredded money.}
<C>__{second biker}
<D>__{bugger! you bitch!}
<A>__{the second biker now sees the money floating all over the place out of the torn bag. his eyes go big with greed as he fires at the old woman, who ducks behind the counter. the biker grabs for the bag and what's left of the money, not expecting the feisty old lady to pop up and unload her second blast into him and the bag. whatever was left of the money on the first round is now gone to shreds along with the bag and the biker who is very dead. bobby is staggered, crawls towards the shreds.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{hijos de puta. bayan a comer su propia mierda en el infierno. (translation: sons of bitches. go eat your own shit in hell).}
<A>__{she comes around the counter to his side as he grabs his wallet and the $1000 cash roll from the dead biker's pants.}
