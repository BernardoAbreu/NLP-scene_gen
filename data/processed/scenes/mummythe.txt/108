<L>__{exterior plateau day}
<A>__{o'connell, evelyn and jonathan stand in the middle of the plateau, surrounded by stray camels. they stare off at the sandy, dusty, volcano as it continues to rumble ominously.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{well,... i guess we go home empty handed.}
<A>__{o'connell looks at evelyn.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{wouldn't say that.}
<A>__{evelyn returns the look, a beat, and then she wraps her arms around his neck and kisses him. o'connell returns it. jonathan just rolls his eyes, snorts in disgust and climbs up onto a camel. when the kiss is over, o'connell and evelyn share a smile, then o'connell leaps up into the saddle, reaches down, grabs evelyn's hand and pulls her up behind him. evelyn wraps her arms around his waist. o'connell and jonathan slap the reins.}
<D>__{o'connell jonathan tuk tuk tuk!!}
<A>__{the camels start to move out. we pan down: to the saddlebag behind evelyn, hidden under the closed back flap, we can see that it's filled with beni's stolen treasure. o'connell, evelyn and jonathan ride off into the sunset.}
