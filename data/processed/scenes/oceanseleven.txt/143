<A>__{the time is 7:27. yen tucks himself into the cash cart's hidden compartment with a slim oxygen tank for company. meanwhile, rusty drills virgil and turk...}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{okay: when do you make the deposit?}
<C>__{turk}
<D>__{not until we get your signal.}
<C>__{virgil}
<D>__{hey. what do we look like: a couple of peckerwood jackasses or something?}
<A>__{no one responds.}
<C>__{rusty}
<P>__{(turning his attention}
<D>__{to yen, squeezed into}
<P>__{the cart)}
<D>__{amazing: how's it feel? you alright?}
<P>__{(as yen nods)}
<D>__{want something to read? magazine?}
<A>__{from the tangle of limbs, a middle finger protrudes to show rusty what he can do with a magazine.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{okay. i'm counting down. thirty minutes of breathing time starts... now.}
<A>__{on "now" a running clock appears on screen, descending from 29:59. it will remain there for the duration of the pre pinch heist, jumping at times between scenes. rusty seals yen inside the cash cart, then gives the top a tug: it's shut tight. as virgil redresses it with the tablecloth, turk snatches back livingston's penne on the way to the door.}
<C>__{livingston}
<D>__{you get no tip.}
