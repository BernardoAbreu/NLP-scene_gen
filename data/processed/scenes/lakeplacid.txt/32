<A>__{keough and kelly are in one canoe, hector and jack are alongside in another. hector is operating one of his sophisticated sonar devices. the calm. the still. the beauty.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{if he's here, i will find him.}
<P>__{(to jack, re kelly)}
<D>__{did she tell you we had sex together?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i never had sex with you!}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{even so, you're allowed to boast. you look thin by the way, i've mentally undressed you, i can see your ribcage.}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{i really don't mean to be discourteous.}
<P>__{(patronizing)}
<D>__{but how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in new england?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{they have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{and what would he do come winter?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{they can survive winter. as long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive,}
<P>__{(to kelly)}
<D>__{am i foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name?}
<C>__{kelly}
<P>__{(scolding)}
<D>__{hector.}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{hector}
<P>__{(to keough)}
<D>__{is this where it happened?}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{around here. yeah.}
<C>__{hector}
<P>__{(knows his crocodiles)}
<D>__{if he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away. crocs hang around the food source.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{but they're nighttime hunters, hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{'cept he wasn't before, was he?}
<P>__{(then to keough)}
<D>__{you know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. you're fat.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{hector.}
<A>__{suddenly there are ripples, fish breaking surface about thirty feet away.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{white perch.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{are they feeding?}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{doesn't look like it.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{they look like they're jumping.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{they look scared.}
<A>__{upon which something grabs the front of kelly's canoe and with one crisp yank, flips it over like a spoon on a dinner table, sending them all flying. in an instant, keough and kelly are swimming for their lives. screaming yelling, they scramble for the canoe, climb onto it's flipped over back. breathless, they all exchange confused looks. "what the hell happened"?}
<C>__{kelly }
<D>__{my hair.}
