<L>__{interior jenny hill's kitchen present day}
<A>__{will and jenny are still sitting at her table, a pitcher of iced tea between them.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{logically, you couldn't be the witch, because she was old back when he was young.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{no, it's logical if you think like your father. see, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you didn't become crazy.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{well, therapy. and one day i realized i was in love with a man who could never love me back. i was living in a fairy tale.}
<A>__{will smiles to hear it called that.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{people aren't like they are in stories. they hurt each other without meaning to. they are kind and unbelievably cruel at the same moment. like me, now. i'm not sure i should have told you any of this.}
<A>__{her composure is starting to break.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{no, i wanted to know. i'm glad i know.}
<A>__{a long beat, both staring at their iced tea. jenny is working herself into more of a state by not talking.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i wanted to meet you for the longest time. i did.}
<P>__{(a smile)}
<D>__{i envied you so much. the way eddie would talk about you when you were at missouri, that award you won. congratulations, incidentally. and when you got the job at the a.p., everything, he was so proud of you. i mean, that's the thing. every moment he loved you.}
<A>__{she's fighting tears, not the first ones she's shed over this.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{and as brightly as the sun would shine when he was with me, every time he left it disappeared. i wanted to be as important to him as you were, and i was never going to be. i was make believe and his other life, you, were real.}
<A>__{angle on will, sorting through his swirling thoughts.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you knew that, didn't you?}
