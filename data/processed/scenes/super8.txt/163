<L>__{interior tunnel #1 (w furniure) night}
<A>__{we're so far away, that the screen is mostly black, with a small speck of sparkly light. they come to an area littered with the stuff of a living room. they look up: another hole leading down, dug straight through a house. they continue, coming to an intersection where a new tunnel branches off.}
<L>__{interior tunnel #2 night}
<A>__{there's dim light from up ahead, where the tunnel bends. the rumbling mechanical sound louder now. joe and cary slowly move forward seeing something off camera that scares and amazes them all at once. it's a hundred foot diameter, forty foot tall underground space, filled with a mechanical marvel a massive, bizarre contraption combining thousands of mechanical pieces, from the missing microwaves, car engines, antennas, and countless other devices wires and cables hang and connect everywhere, all leading to the dirt ceiling, heading up, to somewhere above ground. the thick with fumes space chugs and hums with a slowly increasing pitch, as it it's warming up, getting ready to finally, actually work. they cross to the other side. cary bumps into a hanging sheriff pruitt. cary is about to scream, but joe puts a hand on his mouth and leads him away from pruitt.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{it's sheriff pruitt.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i know. cary look.}
<A>__{makeshift hanging bulbs provide some light; a number of other tunnels are visible from here, too. joe and cary look at the space in disbelief.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{we're under the water tower.}
<A>__{then joe sees something that makes him grab at cary's shirt. cary looks: through the mass of metal and machinery and dangling cables, at the other end of this underground experiment, is the creature. hunched over. back to the boys. and it's savagely eating something. it moves a bit: we see it's a human leg. joe and cary would scream if they didn't need to stay quiet. in a panicked whisper:}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{it's eating a person.}
<A>__{joe moves away from cary to get a better view of the other side of the machinery and there he sees, in an inset section of the rock wall, three human bodies, hanging lifeless from their feet, wrapped in some kind of thin shellac. tight on joe as he sees, among them, alice. his heart pounds, his resolve quadruples. cary sees her too }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{she's here. we're going to use your firecrackers.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{i don't think it's going to hurt it, joe.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{there are other tunnels.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i need you to make noise. lots of it, right here, in two minutes. make it loud and make it last gimme some sparklers.}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(goes through his bag)}
<D>__{ why what are you gonna do ?}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(takes sparklers and a lighter from cary)}
<D>__{make sure you're gone by the time it blows: you can't be here, you gotta run.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<A>__{but joe's already gone. stay with cary, who opens his backpack, starts pulling out his amazing array of explosives, glancing up to make sure he's out of the creature's view }
