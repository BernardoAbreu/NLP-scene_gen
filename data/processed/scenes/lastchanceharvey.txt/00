<A>__{sound of a piano being played. sparse but beautiful.}

<L>__{interior recording room day}
<A>__{harvey shine, mid 60's, sits at a piano in a scruffy recording room, tinkering. we hold on his slightly sad, intense gaze. just then a shaft of crude light illuminates him, accompanied by a knocking sound. from behind a studio window, johnnie, a young rocker type in his 20's beckons. harvey closes the piano lid.}
<L>__{interior studio day}
<A>__{johnnie, unpacking his lunch and turning on various buttons, sits at a mixing desk. in front of him are 2 large tv monitors. harvey joins him.}

<D>__{put my score up first.}

<C>__{johnnie}
<D>__{i'm backed up already, harvey.}
<C>__{harvey}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{johnnie, you were the one that was late. just put it up.}
<A>__{johnnie reluctantly presses various buttons. a `cheesy' commercial for a washing detergent plays. it is accompanied by a jolly classical score. harvey looks on forlornly at his work. as it comes to an end with a flourish, harvey lowers his head. beat. johnnie glances at him.}
<C>__{johnnie}
<D>__{listen, harvey. marvin wants me to present my ideas while your away.}
<A>__{harvey looks up, confused.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{johnnie}
<D>__{look, i'm not doing myself any favours here, harvey. but, i'd watch your back.}
<A>__{we hold on harvey's tired, pensive face.}
