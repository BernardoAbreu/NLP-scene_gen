<A>__{bourne and desh spill out of the elevator and onto the roof. bourne kicking the gun spinning across the floor he and desh facing each other. desh with bourne straight over the edge. desh still on top just. a brutal exchange. matching each other's moves like shadows. relentless. rolling falling onto another roof level. and another. the two men tiring now. desh grabbing for the bag. the pills. bourne kicking them away. bourne has the upper hand now. desh's reaction's slowing. no longer the match he was. bourne drags him to the ground. he's finished. bourne's won. desh shivering convulsing. in the struggle, bourne strangles desh. bourne and nicky hide desh's body.}
