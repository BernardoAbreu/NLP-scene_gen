<L>__{interior grant bathroom moments later}
<A>__{starla is wearing a white towel and brushing her wet hair in the foggy bathroom mirror when she hears air supply's every woman in the world coming from the bedroom. she's struck by it. she moves toward the door. opens it.}
<L>__{interior grant bedroom morning}
<A>__{the shades are drawn, darkening the room. a few candles have been lit. grant is standing there, mostly in silhouette. he's silent, and he doesn't move.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{hey there, sugarplum.}
<A>__{starla looks at him, stirred.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{haven't heard this for a while.}
<A>__{grant walks toward her. he takes her hand in his own, lifting it beside him. he wraps his other arm around her waist. and he slow dances with her. starla dances too, a bit hesitantly, a bit shy.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{i never danced in a towel before.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. i remember it.}
<A>__{starla nods.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{i'm sorry about last night. i get a little insecure sometimes, want to hold on too tight. it's just 'cause you're precious to me, starla.}
<C>__{grant }
<D>__{but i swear to god, baby, i'm turning over a new goddamn leaf. okay?}
<A>__{starla nods, touched. grant's eyes are teary.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{i love you, sugarplum.}
<A>__{starla and grant kiss, tenderly. grant falls to his knees in front of her. he runs his hand over the curve of her hip, her thigh, her buttock, with as much fascination as lust. he pushes starla back onto the bed. he lifts her leg, and kisses it, nibbles on it a little, scrapes his teeth on it. starla is surprised by this, but enjoys it too: it's probably the most foreplay she's had in years. grant crawls on top of her, runs his hands over her breasts, her face. starla's hand moves over grant's back, and to his stomach. when she stops, startled.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{grant, what's that?}
<A>__{she gazes down at the wound between them, on grant's bare abdomen, where the spore entered him. the wound is yellowish, and surrounded by veins. grant, embarrassed, pulls his shirt down.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{just a little bug bite is all.}
<A>__{grant kisses and munches on starla as she lies back on the bed, enjoying it.}
<B>__{o.s. humming.}
