<L>__{exterior theatre night}
<A>__{we track along the side of the theatre. an exit door is thrown open, and frances storms out. as she does, she trips over an old indian beggar. she stops and looks at him. he peers up at her with large forlorn eyes... then holds out his hand. a connection is made. all the anger drains out of her. she gives him money, several bills. he breaks into a wonderful crooked grin. she starts away, hesitates, then hands him the key to the city. he stares at it, bewildered. she strides away toward her limousine, which is now parked with several others at the end of the alley. the chauffeurs are talking and smoking a cigarette. her chauffeur sees her and hurries to his limo. as it pulls into the street, we see harry drift back to the curb and stare after it.}
