<L>__{interior slate's office day}
<A>__{dust is still settling. the staff rises from the mess, coughing. lava rummages in the debris, finds a stiff body.}
<C>__{lava}
<D>__{uncle, uncle, speak to me }
<A>__{but it's only a statue of a golfer from one of slate's trophies.}
<C>__{slate}
<P>__{(sitting up)}
<D>__{i'm over here, you moron and don't call me 'uncle'!}
<A>__{slate's eyes fall on fred's car hood, swinging from a bookshelf. he reaches for it pulls it it stays put, and only releases a new deluge of rubble and plaster which reburies him. at the same time, the door slams open and fred, barney and the other workers tumble inside. their pov office as they take in the destruction. barney notices the wrecking ball amidst the model buildings. as we watch, the last remaining little high rise falls.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{hey, nice going, fred. you even got the spare }
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{barney, shut up }
<P>__{(turning)}
<D>__{mr. slate mr. slate are you all right?}
<A>__{slate staggers to his feet, seething with fury. he finally yanks the car hood free. it bounces and vibrates in his hands like a hand saw.}
<C>__{slate}
<P>__{(eying the men)}
<D>__{for five years slate construction has had the finest safety record in bedrock.}
<P>__{(pacing, angry)}
<D>__{our workers are trained in first aid, our equipment is first rate and our dinos are worm free. and then something like this happens ... i want to know how!}
<A>__{a cacophony of voices starts to answer.}
<C>__{slate}
<D>__{shut up!}
<P>__{(in the sudden silence)}
<D>__{i want one person to answer me:}
<P>__{(waving the car hood)}
<D>__{who's responsible for this?}
<B>__{piltdown}
<A>__{nudges the wrecking ball off the edge of the table. it falls on fred's foot. fred starts to scream and piltdown shoves a pencil holder into his mouth.}
<C>__{piltdown}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{it was flintstone, mr. slate!}
<C>__{pyrite}
<D>__{that's right, mr. slate, it was flintstone!}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{that's a lie, mr. slate!}
<C>__{slate}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{barney}
<P>__{(pointing to his forms)}
<D>__{b. rubble. white male personal reference }
<C>__{slate}
<P>__{(pushing barney aside)}
<D>__{flintstone, i have just one thing to say to you }
<A>__{fred cringes. piltdown and pyrite smirk.}
<C>__{slate}
<P>__{(pumping his hand)}
<D>__{congratulations!}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{piltdown}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{slate}
<D>__{this stuff you had on your car is the most incredible building material i've seen in thirty years in the construction business!}
<P>__{(testing it)}
<D>__{it's strong }
<P>__{(twirling it)}
<D>__{ light }
<P>__{(bending it)}
<D>__{ resilient }
<A>__{it rebounds, "sproinging" him on the chin. he recovers, shakes it off.}
<C>__{slate}
<D>__{where on earth did you get it?}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{oh, it's ah, just something i whipped up in the old garage workshop }
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{ with a little help from my buddy barney, right, barn?}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{well, actually, fred, it was the other way ar }
<A>__{fred hisses between his teeth, repeats the "slate and me are just like this" gesture he made earlier, points at slate.}
<C>__{barney}
<P>__{(reluctant)}
<D>__{sure, fred, right, right.}
<A>__{slate nods, distracted, his eyes and hands running over the smooth lines of the car hood.}
<C>__{slate}
<D>__{the rest of you men go back to work. i want to talk to flintstone and the personal reference alone. come on, move, move...}
<A>__{they go out, piltdown looking furious.}
<C>__{slate}
<P>__{(a man in love)}
<D>__{light as a pterodactyl feather... why, a child could handle this... lava, we could cut construction costs in half... in quarters... in uh... whatchacallit }
<C>__{lava}
<P>__{(patiently)}
<D>__{eighths }
<C>__{slate}
<D>__{eighths, right. flintstone, what do you call this stuff?}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{well, mr. slate, i call it }
<P>__{(hesitating, sotto)}
<D>__{ barney, what do i call it?}
<C>__{barney}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{fibrerock, fred...}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{ i call it fibrerock fred !}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{i mean, ah, 'fibrerock'!}
<C>__{slate}
<P>__{(rolling it over his tongue)}
<D>__{'fibrerock'? 'fibrerock'?}
<P>__{(playing with it)}
<D>__{'fib bre rock' }
<A>__{slate's staff make disparaging noises.}
<C>__{slate}
<D>__{i love it!}
<C>__{slate's staff}
<P>__{(instantly reversing themselves)}
<D>__{love it... great... has a nice ring... says it all, you know?}
<P>__{(etc...)}
<A>__{slate takes the piece of material, leans it on the table so it catches the light. despite himself, lava comes over, examines the car hood... can't help but marvel at it as well. meanwhile, slate puts his arms around fred and barney.}
<C>__{slate}
<P>__{(to lava)}
<D>__{you see this, lava? all those courses of yours at harvrock university, and who saves my bacon? two simple minded run of the mill nobodies.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{gee, thanks, mr. slate.}
<A>__{lava glowers. slate pulls fred and barney close with genuine excitement.}
<C>__{slate}
<D>__{boys, this is a small step for slate construction... a giant step for all mankind.}
<A>__{he points to the translucent material. camera tightens on it. we see fred, barney and slate's reflections in it.}
<C>__{slate}
<P>__{(dramatically)}
