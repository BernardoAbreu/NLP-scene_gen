<D>__{he'll be wearing a helmet. plus they've got, like, superhuman strength anyway.}
<C>__{donnie}
<D>__{i did hear you're not supposed to make direct eye contact. if you look at them too long in their eyes they get freaked out their wires cross.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{i think there's a limit to how far we can go... i mean we can throw shit at him and }
<C>__{donnie}

<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{you don't turn your back on him. it's a sign of disrespect.}

<A>__{jordan takes the bill, starts flipping through it.}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{in stratton parlance, there were three kinds of hookers. there were blue chips, the top of the line. model material. they were priced between $300 and $500 and made you wear a condom unless you gave them a hefty tip, which i always did.}
