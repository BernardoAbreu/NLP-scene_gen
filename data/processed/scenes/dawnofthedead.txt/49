<A>__{the troopers break into an apartment on the floor. an old couple kneels in prayer at a small alter, while their children and their children's children huddle in a corner. the young husband surrenders his gun to a trooper, and roger watches as the group is led into the hallway. suddenly, a young black man charges out of one of the apartments. a woman appears at the door, screaming for him to stop. he breaks through a cloud of gas and wooley fires his automatic. the black man crashes to the floor. wooley is crazed. he kicks in the door of another apartment and fires randomly into the room. the flurry of action causes panic among the civilians in the hall. the younger ones try to escape while the older people kneel or fall against the walls praying.}
<C>__{s.w.a.t. 2}
<D>__{wooley's gone ape shit, man...}
<C>__{roger}
<P>__{wooley! (shouting)}
<A>__{wooley kicks in the door of another apartment. roger charges at him and grabs him around the shoulders. the big man resists. his gun fires and bullets fly wildly. he struggles against roger, but roger manages to hold on.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{gimme a hand... somebody...}
<A>__{another s.w.a.t. trooper steps up out of the cloud of gas. he is very tall and he looks mysterious in the fog as he speaks in a deep voice.}
<C>__{trooper}
<D>__{step away from him.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{gimme a hand.}
<A>__{wooley throws his body around and slams roger against the wall, but roger grabs him again just as the crazed man is levelling off his gun at the open apartment door.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{goddammit... help me... he's crazy!}
<C>__{trooper}
<D>__{step away from him!}
<A>__{just then, wooley wrenches free and pushes roger across the hallway. the trooper carefully aims his weapon and fires one shot through wooley's head. the big man falls back violently. the mysterious trooper turns and hurries away down the hall. other s.w.a.t. officers face him threateningly. he stares at them through his mask. they let him pass. he disappears through the smoke as other officers begin to restore order among the civilians. women scream and cry over their dead loved ones. roger is helped to his feet by another officer. roger's eyes are wide and staring through the insect like lenses of his mask. they are locked on the sight he sees through the door of the apartment which wooley kicked open. the other trooper looks and his eyes widen as well.}
