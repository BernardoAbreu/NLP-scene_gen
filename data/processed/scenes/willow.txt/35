<L>__{exterior crossroads day later}
<A>__{a ghostly wind hants the barren crossroads. the road is pocked with hoofprints and wagon tracks. willow shakes his head at the ashes of his dead fire.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{whatcha thinkin' about, willow?}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{i hate this.}
<A>__{madmartigan squeezes his face between the bars of his cage.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{nobody's gonna take your baby. know why? nobody cares...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{except me.}
<P>__{(wistfully)}

<C>__{willow}
<D>__{you don't know anything about ba bies.}
<A>__{madmartigan kneels and straightens up and points up his finger astutely.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{ahhh! but i know a lot of women who do. why, if i had somebody in my life a little daughter for instance i'd have a reason to live...}
<A>__{he clsps his hands together outside the bars, plead ing:}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{willow. you can't let me die here. not when i wanna help you.}
<A>__{willow looks at the baby in the porta crib. then looks up the empty road. then looks hard at madmartigan.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{you gotta promise to feed her.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{i will.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{fresh goat's milk.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{absolutely!}
<A>__{willow draws his dagger and begins to hack at the chain.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{and give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold. and keep her diaper changed.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{of course! i promise!}
<A>__{willow hacks and pries at the chain until it breaks open. the bottom of the cage falls out, dumping mad martigan into a heap of rags and dust.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{come to daddy, little darlin'.}
<P>__{(picks her up)}
<D>__{i think she likes me!}
<A>__{kneeling on the ground, he plays with the baby. willow quickly hitches the papoose to madmartigan's back and hands him supplies.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{here are her diaper rags. and this is her milk bladder. and when she cries she's either hungry or she's tired rock her on your left shoulder. she likes that.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{don't worry, willow. she's in good hands. you haven't made a mistake.}
<A>__{willow takes the baby and kisses her.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{bye.}
<A>__{he puts her in the papoose.}
<C>__{willow}
<P>__{(to madmartigan)}
<D>__{please take good care of her.}
<A>__{madmartigan stands up. he towers above willow. he pats willow on the head.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{you've done a great job. now you go back to your family and get your crop in.}
<A>__{madmartigan smiles, turns, and marches off down the road. willow sighs with relief, his task accomplished. he watches madmartigan and the baby disappear over a hill.}
