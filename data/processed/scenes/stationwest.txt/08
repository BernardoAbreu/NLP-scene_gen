<L>__{interior charlie's saloon evening}
<A>__{it is a huge elaborate room, lit by overhead chandeliers. a long mahogany bar runs the length of it. to one side there is a big stove and the gambling tables. beyond can be seen pool tables in an alcove. to another side, a man grinds away at a piano. a stairway near the end of the bar leads to an upper floor. the place is crowded and noisy with people. haven saunters towards the dice table, pauses, watches; he is looking the crowd over carefully missing no detail of the place or the people in it. when his turn comes, he picks up the dice, bets all over the place on the line, on the odds, on the seven, then on the come, the hard way, etc. his point is eight.}
<C>__{stickman}
<D>__{eight the hard way! pay the line!}
<A>__{haven bets again, doubling all over the table.}
<C>__{stickman}
<D>__{seven a winner.}
<A>__{players glance at the newcomer. prince appears from nowhere, standing behind the stickman, watching. prince is slender, black haired, handsome and impassive. haven throws again. stellman, an army officer, watches curiously. there is a little rising murmur as haven tosses another natural. he does it without enthusiasm or any lost movement. the bettors get down on him. prince touches the stickman's arm; the man stands aside and prince takes his place with the stick. prince tosses the dice back to haven. haven's eyes are fixed on him. with a little smile, haven throws the dice to the next man, picks up his winnings.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{no, thanks...}
<A>__{his eyes meet prince's again and then he turns away, prince's gaze following him curiously, stellman looks at prince.}
<C>__{stellman}
<D>__{know him?}
<C>__{prince}
<D>__{no. why?}
<C>__{stellman}
<D>__{he just seems kind of free with that money.}
<A>__{camera follows haven, as still smiling slightly, he heads towards the bar, searching the faces of the crowd as he goes. two miners are squared off for a fight and haven, going his way, walks between them, very indifferent, not even glancing back at the sound of scuffle behind him. at the bar haven alone is not watching the fight. all the others have turned to see it; even the barman is busy watching. but haven's eyes are resting on the figure of a woman now at the piano, singing. softly, as if to herself and for her own enjoyment. he is near the end of the bar and near the piano, and since no one else listens to her at this moment, she sings, half smiling, directly for him, and then, self consciously, she stops and turns to sit at a table, as haven watches her. behind them the fight is being stopped and charlie's eyes follow the huge bouncer, mick marion, as he drags the offenders out to the door and the street. all is as usual. the bartender is back at work. as haven turns, he finds that the place beside him is now occupied by the young lieutenant (phil stellman). haven glances at the uniform, then at the pleasant face of the officer, as the barman comes up.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(to barman)}
<D>__{whiskey like you'd pour it for yourself.}
<A>__{a girl sidles up to him, blonde, brash and pretty.}
<C>__{blonde}
<D>__{don't you know it's no fun to drink alone?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{not till after the first one.}
<A>__{he turns his back to her; she gives him a look and saunters off. the barman produces the drinks a beer for stellman, the young officer. the barman folds his arms. stellman looks at haven.}
<C>__{stellman}
<D>__{you a stranger here?}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(to barman, after}
<D>__{gulping it in one}
<P>__{gulp)}
<D>__{what kind of whiskey was that?}
<C>__{barman}
<D>__{on the bottle it says rye but the way you take it, i don't see what difference it makes.}
<A>__{haven smiles at him.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{another rye.}
<A>__{the barman turns to get it. stellman is still looking at haven.}
<C>__{stellman}
<P>__{(easily)}
<D>__{you didn't answer my question.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i'm a stranger everywhere.}
<C>__{stellman}
<D>__{got a job?}
<A>__{the barman gives haven another rye.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{listen, soldier. i know that one, too. got a job, stranger? no? why don't you join the army? three meals a day, a place to sleep, a nice warm uniform }
<C>__{stellman}
<D>__{it has a little more than that.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(deliberately)}
<D>__{yeah, it has one thing more, and that's what i could never take }
<P>__{(looking at stellman's stripes)}
<D>__{it's got second lieutenants.}
<A>__{the barman, listening, senses trouble and signals with his eyes to a big bouncer down the bar. the bouncer moves up quietly.}
<C>__{stellman}
<D>__{if you want to make it a personal matter }
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{i don't make it anything, soldier. you tried to sell something and i didn't buy it so why don't you just beat it?}
<A>__{they stare at each other for a long second, then stellman speaks icily:}
<C>__{stellman}
<D>__{if i weren't in uniform, i might teach you some manners.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{if you could teach me anything, you wouldn't be in a uniform.}
<A>__{stellman's jaw tightens; then he turns and exits abruptly. the barman sighs with relief; the bouncer turns away.}
<C>__{barman}
<D>__{you couldn't be looking for trouble, could you?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i could, but i'm not.}
<C>__{barman}
<D>__{that's fine, because this is one of the best places west of the atlantic ocean to find it.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{that was my first impression.}
<C>__{barman}
<P>__{(as haven looks at him)}
<D>__{that lieutenant's a nice young boy.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i don't doubt it, but his mouth is too big like your ears.}
<A>__{he turns away from the bar, after flipping a coin on to it, while the barman stands there not knowing whether to be angry or philosophical. camera follows haven, as he threads his way through the tables towards the door. his eyes catch sight of the girl who sang at the piano, charlie. she is sitting at a table with prince. prince murmurs to her and she glances at haven, then looks away again. haven notes it. as he comes near the table, the blonde who spoke to him at the bar, accosts him again.}
<C>__{blonde}
<D>__{how is it now?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{blonde}
<D>__{drinking alone?}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(flipping her a coin)}
<D>__{it's all right try it.}
<A>__{haven is looking at charlie. she is checking a stack of coins the blonde has turned in to her. she glances up with a fleeting smile at haven.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it's not a good habit if it makes you pick fights.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{only with second lieutenants.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{we like second lieutenants here.}
<A>__{their gazes meet and prince notes it with narrowing eyes. the gaze holds like a spell, and then charlie's smile comes back, from nowhere.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you see here everybody fights, except the army.}
<A>__{haven looks at her, fascinated. she can feel a fascination herself. now haven smiles a little.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i wouldn't know }
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(still smiling)}
<D>__{so anyone who doesn't like the army }
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i know what you mean, but i'm afraid i will have to come back. i like the way you sing.}
<A>__{she looks at him in a second's silence. haven turns and leaves. she watches him go. prince studies her face, his own grim. a croupier comes up and places a paper before her. she hardly notices it.}
<C>__{croupier}
<D>__{okay, charlie?}
<A>__{charlie snaps out of it long enough to initial the paper.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{that's his limit.}
<C>__{croupier}
<D>__{there's a sucker getting hot with the dice at ed's table.}
<A>__{he turns away. prince sits still, his eyes on charlie, his slim fingers at an habitual trick, that of idly stacking dice in a little pillar and then picking the pillar aloft by holding the lowest dice pinched between the thumb and forefinger, not by the edges, but by the sides. now he does it as he watches charlie's face. her eyes glance again at the disappearing back of haven. the sense of fascination seems to have gotten her, too. then she realizes the presence of prince and his shrewd gaze. she looks at him coolly.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{well cool him off.}
<A>__{prince flips the dice into his palm and rises...}
