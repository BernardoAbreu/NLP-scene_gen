<L>__{interior trevor's cubicle day}
<A>__{trevor relentlessly crunches numbers at his computer. he pauses a moment to stretch and rubs his eyes. a ping from his computer announces he has an interoffice memo file attached. trevor goes to the mailbox on his screen, clicks. up comes a jpeg slideshow. each picture is of gwen dressed in a piece of sexy lingerie. the caption underneath reads work harder. looking around his cubicle, he then takes another look at the jpeg. trevor stands up in the cubicle and we see him peer the outer office looking for gwen. he sits back down. embarrassed trevor closes the memo at least for now. trevor's phone rings. startleing him(and us). he picks it up.}
