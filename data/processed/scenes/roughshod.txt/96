<L>__{interior kitchen morning}
<A>__{med. long shot angled through window past mary. the early morning sun fills the yard. steve is in the corral harnessing the mules. clay and wyatt are taking mary's and helen's trunks out of the wagon.}
<C>__{helen's voice}
<D>__{those trunks look like ours.}
<A>__{mary, who was in profile, turns.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{they are.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{helen is seated at the table. mary stands with her back to the window near the sink.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{how long do you think we'll have to stay here?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{until pa gets around to driving us to minden.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{we don't want to go there.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{no we don't. but that's where we're going. from minden we take a stage to reno, then another one over to auburn and another one to placerville. then it's a day's trip to sonora.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{clay could save us an awful lot of time.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{he certainly could. about a month.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{what are you waiting for? do something.}
<A>__{mary comes over to stand by the table. her expression is thoughtful.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(sharp)}
<D>__{you're not giving up?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{how many ways can a man say no.}
<A>__{helen rises. her manner is determined.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(crosses to door)}
<D>__{maybe i better start working on him.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you'd think he'd do it for elaine's sake, at least...}
<B>__{close shot}
<A>__{as she stops, apparently inspired by mary's last remark. she looks out into the yard where clay is working on the wagon.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{shooting toward elaine's bedroom door. helen crosses to mary.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(sweetly)}
<D>__{if you can't bring him around, nobody can.}
<A>__{she puts her arm around mary's shoulder.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{go on. have another try at him.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{what's the use.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(cajoling)}
<D>__{please. maybe he'll take a good look at you and stop thinking so much about his horses.}
<A>__{as she speaks she edges mary to the door leading outside.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{a man has only so many no's in him.}
<A>__{mary smiles at her, shrugs and exits. helen looks after her. mary's footsteps are heard going down the steps. then helen swings around and going to elaine's door, opens it.}
