<A>__{we're now on harvey's back as he continues his forlorn journey. we move forward, past him, to peer over the hill at the factories below.}
<C>__{real harvey }
<D>__{okay. we're throwing a lot at ya here, so lemme step in an' help ya catch up. this is the story about comic books, an' a guy who made a whole life outta them. you could even say comics saved his life. this guy here, he's our man, harvey pekar all grown up and goin' nowhere. although he's a pretty scholarly cat, he never got much of a formal education. for the most part, he's lived in shit neighborhoods, held shit jobs, and is now knee deep into a second disastrous marriage. so if yer lookin' for romance or escapism or some fantasy figure to save the day, guess what? ya got the wrong movie.}
