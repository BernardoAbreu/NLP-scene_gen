<L>__{exterior basketball field day}
<A>__{a vast field of asphalt segmented by a dozen basketball courts outlined in cracked painterior1 brendan trudges across it, his steps heavy. he stops and stands very still, staring at the ground for a beat then raising his eyes to}
<B>__{the horizon}
<A>__{flat, gray, pin straight. brendan's voice starts speaking rapidly, confident and clear.}
<L>__{1}
<A>__{this describes the location at my school that the "showdown" scenes were originally written for. between when i wrote the script and when we shot it, however, the school expanded and built portable classrooms on the basketball field, and so we reluctantly moved these scenes to the football field.}
<C>__{brendan }
<D>__{yeah it was personal. jerr spooked some decent gees and ran around some what was straight with him, but i'm nobody's bull runner. this wasn't a business sit. but yeah. i bulled him. got in tight, partnered up and sent him over.}
<A>__{pan around to reveal brendan. he looks different, edgier, more alive, wearing different clothes and a thin goatee1. he keeps talking directly at us.}
<C>__{brendan }
<D>__{i'd bull the lot of them, em, i'd burn down the whole party if they tried to play you again. jerr and whoever's nexterior i want to keep you safe.}
<A>__{an arm swings into frame, wearing cheap plastic bracelets and pale blue fingernail polish. it slaps brendan hard in the face. he catches it. emily wrenches her arm away and stumbles backwards onto the pavement. brendan grabs her sleeve. she twists away. he grabs her shoulder, grabs her waist, she resists, and suddenly they are struggling with violent pent up intensity until with a shout she breaks away and falls to the ground. a beat. gulls cry in the distance.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{you can't keep me safe, brendan. i'm in a bigger world now, and you can't hide me from it, and you can't beat it. not if i don't want you to.}
<A>__{brendan's face looks lumpish, while emily's is strong. she stands and walks off into the distance across the barren field. brendan's face watching her go. it is back to present day, pale, clean shaven, sullen. his eyes are cold with resolve.}
