<L>__{exterior santa monica hotel next moment}
<A>__{out of my car. quietly hustling up to wilhite's door: reach it and hear a distinct pop see the flash snap from behind the curtains: gunshot. i know what it is. hit the door.}
<L>__{interior wilhite's room next moment}
<A>__{wilhite's service revolver a foot away from one hand, a sheet of paper still gripped in the other. body half onto the bed, half off. blood drains from a round wound in his temple. check behind me, nobody coming close the hotel door. pick up the sheet of paper contents of the envelope. the first word i see: subpoena.}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{my first thought, pure panic: noonan figured the narco magalena connection.}
<A>__{flip the subpoena over to see his signature: not noonan's. this subpoena has been issued and signed by la district attorney bob gallaudet. flip it back over, wide eyed:}
<D>__{me (v.o.) (cont'd) but it wasn't a federal subpoena. wilhite was being called to testify by bob gallaudet, a man who doesn't piss without bradley's say so.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{bradley trying to beat noonan to the punch and burn the lapd himself...why?}
