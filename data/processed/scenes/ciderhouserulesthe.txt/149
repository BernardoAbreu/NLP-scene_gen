<L>__{exterior cider house picnic area lunchtime}
<A>__{rose rose is sitting at the picnic table when the pickers arrive for lunch, almost simultaneously with homer. he looks at, then looks away from, rose rose. mr. rose is the last to sit down at the table as a very tense, wordless lunch begins.}
<L>__{exterior orchard day}
<A>__{homer is on a ladder picking apples. muddy climbs a ladder on the other side of the same tree.}
<C>__{muddy}
<D>__{don't mess in this, homer, if you know what's good for you.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{how long's this been going on, muddy?}
<C>__{muddy}
<D>__{long enough. you ain't gonna stop it.}
<A>__{muddy looks all around for mr. rose; then he gives homer his knife.}
<C>__{muddy}
<D>__{there's my knife, homer. it ain't gonna do me no good. you give that knife to rose rose, you hear?}
<A>__{homer nods, pocketing the knife. as muddy climbs down and moves his ladder to an adjacent tree, he keeps talking to homer until he disappears in the leaves.}
<C>__{muddy}
<D>__{you best just watch you ass, homer! you don't wanna end up like jack!}
<A>__{homer thoughtfully continues his work.}
