<A>__{larch has twisted himself on the narrow bed so that his face is unusually close to the windowsill, and when the ether cone starts to fall off his face and his slack hand trails down, off the side of the bed the cone becomes caught against the windowsill. he tries to turn his face away from the cone, but he presses his face into the sill thus holding the ether soaked cone over his mouth and nose. his hands twitch, he's trying to wake up; the hand that holds the ether bottle lets the bottle fall. the bottle shatters against the sill; the ether spreads, running red with blood from a cut on dr. larch's hand or finger. music continues over. it's a funeral.}
