<A>__{the fire continues to spread. colette kisses danny on the lips. quincey pulls her away. collette looks back one last time just as the flames reach the door, cutting off any escape. danny breathing hard. he gets up. staggers over to the mirror where his trumpet is. he opens the case and takes the trumpet out. he plops down on the bed and blows a few notes. he stops for a second, a smile on his lips. he starts to play saeta.}

<A>__{stairs rush by underneath. then another hallway. danny's p.o.v. a bright white light at the end of the hall.}
<C>__{danny }
<D>__{oh no. what a fucking cliche.}
<A>__{on danny's face, floating through the hall. his eyes fluttering. moving towards the light. closer. closer. danny's eyes close, his head droops.}
<T>__{fade to white:}
<A>__{close on danny as his eyes flutter and open. danny's p.o.v. an image slowly coming into focus ... ... jimmy staring down at him with concern. danny blinks his eyes again. looks up at ... ... a paramedic working on him. danny smiles a weak smile at jimmy. jimmy just sits there, nodding his head, a big shit eating grin on his face. the paramedic continues to work on danny. his eyes slowly close.}
