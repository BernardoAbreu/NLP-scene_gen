<L>__{interior d'artagnan's room night}
<A>__{d'artagnan returns from his ride to athos' place. he looks down at the queen's door. he checks the clock on the wall; it is a few minutes past nine. he enters his room, moves to the window, and waits there, to catch a glimpse of her.}
<L>__{interior country manor house front room night}
<A>__{aramis is digging into a hearty meal, while porthos only stares at his plate.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{see? there is plenty of food in the country. but the king keeps it going to the army instead of }
<A>__{athos marches in, all business.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{he is sleeping. now see here, aramis, it's time you told us }
<A>__{he breaks off as a voluptuous serving girl leans over to spoon food onto porthos' plate; her breasts jiggle below his nose, and she gives him a smile.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{i have no appetite for food, i am wasting away. say goodbye to porthos, for he is gone. even women don't interest me now.}
<A>__{the girl moves to whisper with two other serving girls, who seem fascinated with the roguish porthos; their giggles and winks make porthos even more morose; he tells his friends...}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{i tell you a secret. i sleep with three women at once, not because my appetite is so great, but because now it take three to excite me.}
<A>__{porthos heaves himself to his feet and shuffles off; aramis sighs, having heard all this before. athos sits down.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{who is he, aramis?}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{tomorrow.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{tonight! right now! we steal a man from a royal prison, we hide in a country chateau among an assortment of saints and sluts such as only you could provide, and still you wish to tell me nothing?!}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{you seek facts, when it would be better to seek truth.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{you are not my priest, aramis! you would not be, even if i had one.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{you are bitter, athos. you are torn by grief, not only for raoul, but for d'artagnan, whom you love, and now treat as an enemy.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{he who is not with us is against us.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{those are the words of a broken spirit. my spirit is whole. i have trusted d'artagnan with my deepest secrets, and i will never believe he is my enemy.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{then you are a fool a fool who has never lost a son. what gives you the right to judge me, to play god with the lives of others? is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{there is that, of course but mainly it is because i am so much smarter than everyone else.}
<A>__{they are interrupted by porthos' bloodcurdling scream.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{porthos?!}
<A>__{he draws his sword and runs for the outside.}
