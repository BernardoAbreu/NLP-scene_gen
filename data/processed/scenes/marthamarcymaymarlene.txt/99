<D>__{you okay?}

<D>__{uh huh.}

<D>__{you know that death is the most beautiful part of life, right? death is beautiful because everyone fears death. and fear is the greatest human emotion of all because it creates complete awareness. when you're scared it forces you to be completely aware of your surroundings and the moment you're in. it brings you to now and that makes you truly present. and when you are truly present, that's nirvana, that's pure love. so, death is pure love.}
