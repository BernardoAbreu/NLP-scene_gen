From his belt, Shane takes a steel wand with an adhesive disc attached, aims it at the fleeing boat and FIRES. A cable shoots up -- THUD... The disc sticks to the boat's hull. Shane pushes a button on the wand retracting the cable and drawing himself closer. Dangling from the cruiser, Shane fixes a BOMB to the hull.

<DIAL>__{Sir yes sir.}

<TRANS>__{CUT TO:}
<ACTION>__{Shane's military-march version of the musical. Nuns sing "How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria?" The Von Trapp kids perform "So Long, Farewell." In the audience, Julie watches in astonishment. She is surrounded by her children. Scott: in a suit, his hair combed, Claire: dressed to the nines, the little Brownie Troop, even Murney. Lulu has a basket in her lap -- inside: GARY THE DUCK and his new family, the most adorable ducklings you ever saw. They all watch, rapt. You Are Sixteen begins. Shane watches with bated breath. Todd spins. In SLOW MOTION, he leaps into the SPIN KICK. It's fantastic -- a Michael Jordan dunk. The AUDIENCE goes nuts, Shane stands, and shouts:}
<CHAR>__{SHANE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{YESSS! (And an Armed forces:) Huu-ah!}
<ACTION>__{The Audience stares at him, until he sits back down, beaming with pride. Finally: "CLIMB EVERY MOUNTAIN." Hearts swell, as the family crosses the papier-mache alps. A STANDING OVATION. The performers take their curtain calls, then giddily gesture Shane to come out. He humbly steps into view -- and the house goes crazy. Thundering applause. A cellophane bouquet of flowers gets thrust on him. Shane smiles, touched. Mission accomplished.}
