<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{eric!}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{quiet!}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(loud whisper to amanda)}
<D>__{stop that. dr. grant says this is dangerous territory.}
<C>__{amanda}

<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no, dr. grant says...}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{dr. grant says this, dr. grant says that...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{because "dr. grant" isn't looking for eric. dr. grant is looking for the coast.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{fine...and when the tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me.}
<C>__{amanda}
