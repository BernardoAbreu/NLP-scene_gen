<A>__{railly has just arrived for work. she's slipping on her white doctor's coat when... dr. casey, one of the other residents, sticks his head in the door waving a crayoned message on a page torn from a magazine.}
<C>__{dr. casey}
<D>__{this was in my box, but i have a slight suspicion it wasn't meant for me.}
<A>__{casey enters the room, reading the scrawled words dramatically.}
<C>__{dr. casey}
<D>__{"you are the most beautiful woman i have ever seen. you live in a beautiful world. but you don't know it. you have freedom, sunshine, air you can breathe."}
