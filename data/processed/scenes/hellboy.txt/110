<T>__{flash back to:}
<L>__{exterior tenement building courtyard day}
<A>__{somewhere in a smokestack city, grown ups and kids hang banners and prepare a ragged birthday party in a cement courtyard. angle liz continuous sitting on some tenement steps, liz, age 11. sullen, alone, a gold crucifix hanging on her chest. a woman liz's mother comes down the courtyard steps, carrying a basket of apples.}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(to liz)}
<D>__{liz!! liz!! come on, darling, give mummy a hand.}
<A>__{nearby, under a balloon archway, munching candy coated apples... three kids giggle and point at her.}
<C>__{blonde kid}
<D>__{freak!}
<A>__{liz turns to see them.}
<C>__{blonde kid}
<P>__{(to his friend)}
<D>__{see? she knows her name.}
<A>__{liz shies away from them.}
<C>__{blonde kid}
<D>__{go home, you freak. we don't want you here.}
<A>__{they start throwing stones. one hits the steps. another misses her by inches. a third hits her in the shoulder. scared, liz turns but a rock catches her full on the face. she falls down, blood trickling from her forehead, splattering the pavement. she starts sobbing. another rock sails across, but this time, in mid air, it catches fire and turns to ash. a ripple of heat starts crawling up liz's hands. soon a pale blue flame rings her entire arm.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(sobbing)}
<D>__{not again, please, not again...}
<A>__{firelight glints off the crucifix.}
