<L>__{exterior road day}
<A>__{sorsha and her men now ride with a caravan of fifty nockmaar troops. chained by their necks. willow and madmartigan walk behind a wagon. raziel sits trapped in a cage on the back of the wagon.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{i can't go on...}
<A>__{willow loses strength, falls and is dragged. madmarti gan picks him up and carries him on his shoulders. sorsha sees this.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{willow, why don't you use your mag ic to get us out of here?}
<C>__{raziel}
<D>__{he's no magician.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{he turned that monster into stone!}
<A>__{raziel peers sternly at willow, who is eye level with her cage.}
<C>__{raziel}
<D>__{did you give that acorn its power?}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{raziel}
<D>__{a magician makes magic. any fool can use it.}
<A>__{madmartigan shakes his head at her.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{then you get us out of here.}
<C>__{raziel}
<D>__{i will! but i need help!}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{i will help you...!}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{i won't.}
<C>__{raziel}
<D>__{you must learn magic.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{that's all i ever wanted!}
<C>__{raziel}
<D>__{then i will teach you.}
<A>__{sorsha rides up from the rear of the caravan, carrying the baby, who is crying. madmartigan, with willow still on his shoulders, straightens up and flirts with her.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{nice horse...nice hair...real nice hair...i'd say you've got the most beautiful hair i've ever }
<A>__{she flashes her eyes at him.}
<C>__{sorsha}
<D>__{wolff wants to boil you in oil.}
<A>__{she nods toward her lieutenant, who snarls viciously.}
<C>__{sorsha}
<D>__{don't tempt me.}
<A>__{she turns away. the baby squirms and cries.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{if you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.}
<C>__{sorsha}
<D>__{shut up.}
<A>__{sorsha rides along. she shifts the baby to her other shoulder, and she instantly stops crying. sorsha throws a look at willow. madmartigan takes a long deep breath.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{mmmm, i love the smell of a woman.}
<C>__{sorsha}
<P>__{(angry threat)}
<D>__{my step father's going to tear you apart.}
<A>__{madmartigan pounds his chest and taunts her:}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{i'm torn apart already. i mean it! under all that armor is a beautiful }
<A>__{crack! sorsha whips her horse and gallops ahead.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{who is that girl, anyway?}
<C>__{raziel}
<D>__{sorsha, queen bavmorda's daughter.}
<A>__{madmartigan snaps his finger and discourages himself.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{forget that one, madmartigan.}
<A>__{raziel leaps against the bars of her cage, chatters her teeth and whispers to willow.}
<C>__{raziel}
<D>__{willow. to learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{what do i need for that?}
<C>__{raziel}
<D>__{we must start with feathers, dung, and a lock of your hair.}
<A>__{willow pulls a strand of his hair out in front of his eyes and frowns at it. madmartigan, meanwhile, can't take his eyes off sorsha.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{now that's a woman...!}
