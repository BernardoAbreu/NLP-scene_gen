<L>__{interior betty's house dining room night}
<A>__{del is facing her, tiny rivulets of blood running into his terrified eyes. wesley stands at his shoulder, still holding a handful of his hair, still poised with the knife.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{i got it from a truck driver named duane cooley, out of amarillo. he brings my cars down from detroit. but i haven't touched it, i swear to you... please! please! please!}
<A>__{annoyed, charlie stuffs the socks back in del's mouth. betty stares. her gaze shifts from del to wesley, drawn by wesley's demonic expression.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{consider yourself lucky. luckier than those 'injuns' you have such contempt for.}
<A>__{wesley stares at the top of del's head. betty stares at wesley. charlie walks into the kitchen for another drink.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{i will tell you, if anyone got a raw deal it's the american indian. this country has a black mark on its soul for what was done to them.}
<A>__{wesley's nostrils flare. betty leans forward.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{i'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. it's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, wesley?}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{it sure is!!}
<A>__{and with a long scream, wesley rips del's scalp from his head. it makes a sickening sound like fabric tearing. for a long moment, there is only silence. an eerie silence. suddenly, del screams into his socks and thrashes in his seat, blood pouring down his head on all sides. somehow, he manages to get to his feet, the chair still taped to him, and begins smashing into whatever is near. blood flies and curios shatter as del thunders through the room. a dying bull, only messier. it's quite a show.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{jesus christ!!!}
<A>__{wesley steps back, staring at the dripping scalp in his hand, as if wondering how it got there. betty is transfixed, horrified. charlie re enters. the two men look at each other over del's muffled screams as he plows headlong into wooden paneling, a china cabinet, and finally, back toward them near the breakfast counter. del bashes blindly into it.}
<C>__{charlie }
<P>__{(to wesley)}
<D>__{what the fuck is the matter with you?!}
<A>__{wesley is practically foaming at the mouth, still rushing on what he did. charlie draws a silenced pistol and mercifully shoots del through the head. the big man stops suddenly, blinks once or twice, topples over.}
