<L>__{exterior rear gaskell house night}
<A>__{grady comes out the back: door and ferrets a joint from his pocket, lights it. he takes a long draw, walks around the side of the house. as he passes a window, a voice accosts him.}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{there you are.}
<A>__{grady starts, but when he looks through the window, he sees that the voice belongs to walter gaskell and the person to whom he's talking is sara. they are standing in the kitchen, near an elaborate wine rack.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i could swear i had a '63 chateau latour in here. you haven't seen it, have you?}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i doubt i'd recognize a '63 chateau latour if i was sitting on it.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{you'd recognize it if you tasted it.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i doubt it, darling.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(angling & bottle to the light)}
<D>__{well, q certainly will. and, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{you want to keep him happy.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{if he' s happy. . .}
<P>__{(kissing her as he exits)}
<D>__{i'm happy.}
<A>__{as walter goes, grady studies sara as she stands alone in the quiet little room, looking small and tired. finally, she takes a breath, steeling herself, and moves off, returning to the clamor inside her house. grady sighs, guilt stricken, then detects a flicker of light coming from the darkness beyond. a figure is watching him from the retaining wail that leads to the gaskell's garage. grady blinks, chagrined that he's been caught eavesdropping, then his eyes narrow and he steps off the porch.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{james?}
<A>__{james leer wears the same nasty overcoat from class, a green knapsack hanging off one shoulder. grady looks at what appears to be a sliver of moonlight in james' palm.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{it's fake.}
<A>__{james' face betrays his own fragile chagrin and grady peers more closely at what lies in his extended hand. the sliver of moonlight is, in fact, a shiny pearl handled}
<B>__{pistol.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{it was my mother's. she won it in a penny arcade in baltimore when she was in catholic school.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{it's very convincing.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{it used to shoot these little paper caps, but they don't make them anymore. the caps.}
<A>__{grady reaches for the gun, but james closes his fingers and slips the tiny thing back into his overcoat.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{it's just. ..for good luck. some people carry rabbits' feet...}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{...you carry firearms.}
<A>__{as grady exhales a plume of smoke, james' eyes pass briefly over the jay. grady notices, offers.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{no, thank you. i don't like to lose control of my emotions.}
<A>__{grady nods, accustomed to james' weirdness.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{i'm not supposed to be here, in case you were wondering. i crashed. i mean, not intentionally...}
<A>__{james nods toward the house, where hannah green can be seen in a window, still fending off the determined q.}
<C>__{james leer }
<D>__{...but the other night, hannah and i were together, at the movies, and she asked me. since she was coming. so i ended up coming. too.}
<A>__{grady nods, ponders this over elaborate explanation.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{are you and hannah seeing each other, james ?}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{no! what gave you that idea?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{relax, james. i'm not her father. i just rent her a room.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{she likes old movies like i do, that's ail.}
<P>__{(glancing back at the window)}
<D>__{besides, she doesn't really know me. she thinks she does, but she doesn't. maybe it's because she's mormon and i'm catholic.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{maybe it's because she's beautiful and she knows it and try as she might to not let that screw her up, it's inevitable that it will in some way.}
<A>__{james looks away from the window, at grady.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{you're not like my other teachers, professor tripp.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{you're not like my other students, james. so what was the movie you two saw?}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{huh? oh. son or fury. with tyrone power and frances farmer.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{she went crazy, frances farmer.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{so did gene tierney. she's in it too.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{sounds like a good one.}
<C>__{james leer}
<P>__{(a crooked smile)}
<D>__{it's not bad.}
<A>__{grady considers james' fragile face.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{listen, james, about this afternoon. in workshop. i'm sorry. i think i let things get a bit out of control.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{they really hated it. i think they hated it more than any of the other ones.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{well...}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{it doesn't matter. it only took me an hour to write.}
<C>__{grady}
<P>__{(truly impressed)}
<D>__{really? that's remarkable.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{i have trouble sleeping. while i'm lying in bed i figure them out. the stories.}
<A>__{as james gazes off at the gloaming greenhouse, grady looks down at the left front pocket of james' overcoat. like a nervous tic, james' hand hidden twitches against the modest bulk of the cap gun.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{you cold, james?}
<C>__{james leer}
<P>__{(distant)}
<D>__{a little.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{so what are you doing out here?}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{it's colder in there. }
<C>__{grady}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{you're right.}
<A>__{james blinks, startled by grady's laughter, startled that he's said something funny. he looks back to the greenhouse}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{actually, i saw the greenhouse. so i thought ...i thought i'd come out here and take a look at it. you don't see one of those every day. it looks like heaven...}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{heaven?}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{i saw a movie once. part of it took place in heaven. everyone wore white and lived in crystal houses. like that. at least that's the way i remember it...}
<A>__{abruptly, james glances at his watch.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{i should be going.}
<A>__{james turns away, then stops. he stands like this a moment, then turns back. holds out his right hand.}
<C>__{james leer }
<D>__{goodbye, professor tripp.}
<A>__{grady hesitates, then shakes james' hand. james moves off then, leaving the light of the house behind.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{james.}
<P>__{(as he stops)}
<D>__{don't leave just yet. there's something i think you ought to see.}
<C>__{james leer}
<D>__{i will miss my bus.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{this is worth it.}
<A>__{james looks conflicted.}
<C>__{grady }
<D>__{trust me.}
