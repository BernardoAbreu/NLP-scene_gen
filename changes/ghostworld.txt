<DIAL>__{Hey, look what I got...}
<ACTION>__{She takes a crumpled envelope from her pocket and pulls out her DIPLOMA.}
<CHAR>__{REBECCA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Wow... finally.}
<CHAR>__{ENID} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It just came yesterday...}
<ACTION>__{Pause. Josh enters. Enid turns around.}
<CHAR>__{JOSH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hi Enid.}
<CHAR>__{ENID} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hey Josh.}
<CHAR>__{JOSH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Are you ready to go?}
<ACTION>__{For a moment it's not clear who he's talking to, and then:}
<CHAR>__{REBECCA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(still counting receipts)}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, just one second...}
<ACTION>__{She finishes, takes off her apron and emerges from behind the counter. She kisses Josh perfunctorily.}
<CHAR>__{REBECCA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(to Josh)}
<DIAL>__{Did you remember to pay the phone bill?}
<CHAR>__{JOSH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah.}
<CHAR>__{REBECCA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(to Enid)}
<DIAL>__{Call me sometime.}
<CHAR>__{ENID} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Definitely. We still have to go to that shoe store sometime.}
<ACTION>__{Rebecca & Josh leave. Enid is totally alone in the now-alien world of the Quality Cafe. A momentary pause as she calmly stares into her orange juice. We see a small, round TRAVEL BAG at her feet.}
<LOC>__{EXT. CITY STREETS/ACME SHOES - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{We see Enid walking down the familiar streets of her world. It's early evening, quiet except for distant street noises. She walks toward the old ACME SHOES AND REPAIR STORE. It looks the same, miraculously preserved, until she stands right in front of it. She looks through the partially papered over window and sees WORKMEN inside installing new fixtures: a modern counter and several small tables, all made from a FAMILIAR GREEN PLASTIC. A sign in the window reads: "Coming Soon: Another COFFEE EXPERIENCE.}
<LOC>__{EXT. CITY STREET - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{She continues walking as the sun has set and there is a calm stillness to the city. She turns a corner and is startled by her reflection in a large window made of one-way glass. She stops and looks at herself. Everything about her looks perfect for once; no need to change a thing. She moves closer to the glass and, shading her eyes, tries to look inside. She continues walking. Darkness is just setting in and she has the street all to herself.}
<LOC>__{EXT. COMMERCIAL AREA/BUS STOP - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{We see Enid at NORMAN'S BUS STOP, sitting on the bench. She looks at the apartment building across the street. A woman who has just arrived home from work turns on the TV, bathing her living room with that EERIE BLUE LIGHT. The same thing happens in another window down the street... then another... Enid looks down the street. In the distance A BUS rounds the corner and heads toward her. From a third-story window across the street, we see the bus as it arrives and stops, blocking Enid from view. A moment later it pulls away, leaving an empty bench. The CAMERA moves upward, farther and farther away as the music swells and the credits roll.}
<LOC>__{EXT. BRIDGE - EVENING}
<ACTION>__{The bus disappears over the crest of the bridge.}
