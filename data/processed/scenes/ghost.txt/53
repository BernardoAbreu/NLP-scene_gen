<A>__{to a pair of loudspeakers in a storefront window. the music blares out once more and sounds of gospel fill the street. sam looks up. he is back in front of the storefront church with the sign for sister oda mae brown, medium, spirit reader, advisor, hanging overhead. below it is another sign.
