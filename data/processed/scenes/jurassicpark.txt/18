<L>__{int incubation room, laboratory}
<A>__{a vast room bathed in infrared light, filled with long tables. the first tables have rows and rows of centrifuges, each bearing dozens of test tubes. wu leads the group.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{okay, you have your "complete" dna strand. how do you grow it?}
<C>__{wu}
<D>__{we use unfertilized crocodile ova as our breeding medium.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{our primordial soup.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{and how do you know what it is you're growing?}
<A>__{wu shrugs.}
<C>__{wu}
<D>__{well, we have computer techniques to try and map out finds on an evolutionary basis. but mostly, we just grow it and find out what it is. if it's something we're interested in, and it}
<A>__{survives, we}
<D>__{keep it.}
<A>__{grant and ellie share a concerned look.}
<C>__{gennaro}
<D>__{and if you're not interested?}
<A>__{wu indicates a cabinet of chemicals with skull and crossbone warnings. timmy regards the poison with excitement. lex calls from deeper in the room.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{come look!}
<A>__{here, plastic eggs lay on the long tables, their pale outlines obscured by a grey mist that covers the tables. the eggs are all gently rocking as technicians roam up and down the aisles. hammond walks ahead of the group. as wu speaks, hammond listens and enjoys it as though he's hearing it for the first time.}
<C>__{wu}
<D>__{this is the incubation room. we keep the temperature at ninetynine degrees and a relative humidity of one hundred percent.}
<C>__{grant and timmy}
<D>__{jurassic atmosphere.}
<A>__{timmy smiles at grant. hammond winks at timmy.}
<C>__{wu}
<D>__{we}
<A>__{also run a high oxygen concentration,}
<D>__{up to thirty three percent, so if you feel faint, please tell me right away.}
<A>__{lex feigns a faint, timmy cracks a small smile. they move forward, waist deep in the mist. a strange green light emanates from the incubators. lex is half consumed by the mist. she mimics the witch.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{i'm ... melting!}
<A>__{ellie laughs and pulls lex close.}
<C>__{wu}
<D>__{reptile eggs contain large amounts of yolk but no water at all. the embryos must extract water from the surrounding environment.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{that's why you create the mist.}
<A>__{wu nods. hammond just enjoys the scene as grant and ellie watch a thermal sensor moving from one egg to the next, touching each with a flexible wand, beeping. lex and timmy let their hands glide over the sides of the green glowing incubators fully awed by the strange, big eggs they hold.}
<C>__{wu}
<D>__{children, please do not touch! the eggs are permeable to skin oils.}
<A>__{grant that very close to an egg. he sniffs it.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{what kind of eggs are these? are these shells plastic?}
<C>__{wu}
<D>__{yes, they are, the embryos are mechanically inserted and then hatched in this room. but we've managed to sufficiently mimic the actual biological process these creatures rupture the plastic membrane that they're contained in when they're born. like real births.}
<A>__{they reach an endless row of incubators, lined up along the wall, beneath a viewing area like those found in an ob gyn ward.}
<C>__{wu}
<D>__{eggs that are determined viable spend their last couple days in our specially designed incubators, which help accelerate the pre natal developmental stages. which is interesting becaus}
<A>__{e}
<D>__{we're having a problem with the adult animals }
<A>__{hammond claps a hand over wu's mouth and laughs.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{there's no problem dr. wu can't handle. now who wants to see the real thing?}
<A>__{as they exit the camera pans the misty aisles, studying the eggs.}
