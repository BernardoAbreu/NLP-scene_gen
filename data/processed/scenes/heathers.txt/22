<L>__{interior the chandler kitchen day}
<A>__{the sound of a lock being jimmied is heard moments before veronica and j.d. burst through the door.}
<C>__{veronica}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{trust me. she skips the saturday morning trip to grandma's even when she's not hungover.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that'll induce her to spew red, white, and blue.}
<A>__{veronica opens the refrigerator. j.d. opens the cupboard beneath the sink.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{what about orange juice and milk? what's the upchuck factor on that?}
<A>__{j.d. holds up a bottle of pine sol.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{i'm a pine sol man, myself.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{don't be a dick. that stuff'll kill her.}
<A>__{veronica and j.d. make queasy eye contact. veronica descends back into the refrigerator with some worked up enthusiasm as j.d. suavely pours bits of various toxic containers (detergent, scouring powder) into a glass beer mug.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{o kay. we'll cook up some soup and put it in a coke. sick, eh? now should it be chicken noodle or bean with bacon?}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{man veronica, pull the plug on that shit. i say we go with big blue.}
<A>__{j.d. raises the glass filled with what is now a strange blue liquid. veronica stares at the glass, scared by her own thoughts.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{what are you doing ? you just can't go.....besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{okay we'll use this. she won't be able to tell what she's drinking.}
<A>__{j.d. pulls down a ceramic cup and triumphantly pours the poisonously blue beer glass contents into it. an eerie pause ensues. veronica takes out a milk carton and a container of orange juice. she struts back to the counter in anger, icily muttering.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{just give me a cup, jerk.}
<A>__{j.d. sheepishly pulls down an identical ceramic cup. veronica tears it from him and pours some milk and then some orange juice into the cup.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{milk and orange juice. hmmmm. maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{yeah, great.}
<A>__{they both start coughing harshly.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{no luck? well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. quite nicely.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{chick en.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{you're not funny.}
<A>__{j.d. turns on his heel and slinks away. veronica glares down at the mess of toxic containers. with both arms, veronica clumps the toxic containers together and drops beneath the sink to put them away. j.d. swaggers back into the kitchen as veronica bobs back into view.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{j.d. kisses the back of her neck. veronica closes her eyes with a grudging smile.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{bonehead.}
<A>__{veronica dreamily reaches out to one of the two ceramic cups. not the one with milk and orange juice in it. heather chandler's bedroom heather chandler angelically sleeps as veronica and j.d. enter.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{morning, heather.}
<A>__{like a lion, heather chandler rouses herself up.}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{veronica. and jesse james. quelle surprise. hear about veronica's affection for regurgitation?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{we both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{did we? how the hell'd you get in here?}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{veronica knew you'd have a hangover. so i whipped this up. family recipe.}
<A>__{j.d. holds out the ceramic cup. heather chandler snorts.}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{did you put a phlegm globber in it or something? i'm not drinking that piss.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{i knew this stuff would be too intense.}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{intense? grow up. you think i will drink it just because you call me chicken .}
<A>__{they do. they're right.}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{just give me the cup, jerk.}
<A>__{heather chandler rises from the bed and struts to j.d. in anger. she takes the cup, slams her head back and downs it all. she then launches her head forward, her face contorted in agony.}
<C>__{heather chandler}
<D>__{corn nuts!}
<A>__{heather chandler's eyes slam shut and her limp body crashes through the glass coffee table. veronica and j.d. freeze.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{something tells me you picked up the wrong cup.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{no shit, sherlock. i can't believe it. i just killed my best friend.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{and your worst enemy.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{same difference. oh jesus, i'm gonna...}
<A>__{veronica staggers to a desk. j.d. laughs out of shock.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{what are we going to tell the cops? "fuck it if she can't take a joke, sarge."}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{stop kidding around. i'm going to have to send my s.a.t. scores to san quentin instead of stanford.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{i'm just a little freaked, all right?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{you got what you wanted, you know.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{it's one thing to want somebody out of your life. it's another thing to serve them a wake up cup of drano.}
<A>__{veronica stares off as j.d. paces like a caged animal. he scopes onto the rubble of the shattered coffee table and sees cliff notes for the bell jar plus a magazine proclaiming "the fall of the american teen" sticking out from beneath heather chandler's body.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{we did a murder. in ohio, that's a crime. but if this was like a suicide thing.....}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{like a suicide thing?}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.}
<C>__{veronica}
<P>__{(calming down)}
<D>__{i can do heather's handwriting as well as my own.}
<A>__{veronica takes some stationery from the desk and begins writing, calling out her words.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{"you might think what i've done is shocking..."}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{"to me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{that's good, but heather would never use the word "myriad."}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{this is the last thing she'll ever write. she'll want to cash in on as many fifty cent words as poss.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{she missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{that only proves my point more. the word is a badge for her failures at school.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{you're probably right..."people think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. nobody understood i had feelings too."}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{"i die knowing no one knew the real me."}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{that's good. have you done this before?}
<A>__{veronica's smile dies as she looks to heather chandler's corpse.}
