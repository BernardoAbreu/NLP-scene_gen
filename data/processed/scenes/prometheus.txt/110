<L>__{interior med pod later}
<A>__{watts wakes as the oxygen line withdraws from her mouth. she looks down, bleary and hurting. her star shaped wound is stitched closed with mechanically precise sutures. the pod releases the restraints securing her arms and legs. she takes a deep breath. looks out and freezes.}
<C>__{watts's pov}
<A>__{the lights in the suite outside have been damaged somehow. they flicker and strobe. through the glass canopy spattered with blood watts sees a full grown alien crouching over vigoda's body on the floor.}
<C>__{on watts}
<A>__{staring in horror. the pod sprays a liquid bandage over her scar. the intravenous lines drop out of her arms. watts realizes the pod is about to release her.}
<C>__{watts}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{not yet...not yet...}
<A>__{slowly she reaches out. with trembling fingers she grips the canopy to hold it closed. the med pod pulls the epidural needle out of her spine. sprays liquid bandage over the puncture. watts closes her eyes. grits her teeth as her nerves wake up. jangling pain. she opens her eyes. the alien hunches over vigoda's body, tearing at his flesh. the ventilation hum inside the pod goes quiet. the canopy pulls free of watts's weakened grip. swings quietly open. watts huddles in the open pod. naked but for her bandages. the alien she gave birth to is ten feet away. its spiny back to her. vigoda's gun lies on the floor outside the pod. vickers's suite continuous watts reaches out of the pod with exquisite slowness. lays her hand on the gun. drags it a few inches closer. the alien turns its pale eyeless head. watts freezes. for a moment time stops. the alien lunges. watts snatches up the gun and fires. holds the trigger down. the alien jerks and staggers an eye twisting sight in the strobing muzzle flashes and falls. watts empties the clip into the thing. acid gouts from its wounds and eats into the deck until a section of decking gives way and falls to the deck below, leaving a dark hole. watts collapses on the rug, cradling her stomach in pain. she crawls to vigoda's desecrated body. with her eyes half averted from the sight, she searches the body. finds a spare ammo clip and jacks it into the gun.}
<C>__{corridor}
<A>__{watts walks down the hallway in trousers and jacket. leaning on the wall, her face drawn with pain. one hand laid over the fantastic scar on her abdomen. the gun slung on her shoulder. dark events have transformed the magellan. the metal of the walls is torn in some places; in others, blackened by fire. watts rounds a corner. finds a workstation left in shambles: lockers and chairs overturned. a pool of drying blood. wide smears of blood show where something man sized was dragged out of the puddle across the floor up the wall. into the darkness of an open vent.}
<C>__{command deck}
<A>__{watts emerges from a lift, jacket pulled tight around her. the emergency lights are on: dim blue bulbs throbbing. she rounds the corner toward the bridge. janek looks at watts like she's a ghost.}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{vickers said you were dead.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{i was.}
<A>__{she lets the jacket fall open to reveal her bandaged midriff. janek takes that in grimly.}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{so there's two of these things on my ship now.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{no. i brought it in.}
<P>__{(hefts her gun)}
<D>__{i took it out.}
<C>__{bridge}
<A>__{the surviving complement of the magellan are holed up on the bridge: janek, glasse, stillwell, vickers. the soldiers shepherd and ray. watts stops cold when she sees vickers. she crosses the bridge in three long strides cocks a fist and snaps the older woman's head around with a hard right cross. vickers staggers backward, gasping. stillwell drags watts away.}
<C>__{stillwell}
<D>__{what'd you do that for?}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{protocol two.}
<A>__{vickers stiffens in shock. stares fearfully at watts. watts frees herself from stillwell's grip. her jacket falls open, revealing her bandages. stillwell gasps in horror.}
<C>__{stillwell}
<D>__{christ!}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{what happened to you?}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{david exposed me to a parasite. he just watched it take me.}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{i threatened to make him leave.}
<C>__{vickers}
<D>__{what's he doing out there?}
<A>__{watts locks eyes with vickers. their hatred is thoroughly mutual. a wordless truce. there's work to do.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{there's a ship under the pyramid. david calls it the juggernaut. he's inside it. re activating it.}
<P>__{(lays a hand on her scar)}
<D>__{the things that infected martin and me.}
<C>__{watts }
<D>__{the engineers made them to kill humans. there are thousands of them on the ship. they were taking them to earth. that's what the juggernaut is for. to exterminate us.}
<A>__{a stunned silence as the others take that in.}
<C>__{glasse}
<D>__{we've got to get off this rock.}
<A>__{janek gestures to}
<C>__{janek}
<D>__{david crippled the nav computer. i'm trying to lay a course in by hand. never done it. i'm not sure anyone ever has on a ship like this. we can't lift until david lets us.}
<C>__{watts}
<D>__{even if we could, we can't leave david on that ship. we have to stop him.}
<A>__{the magellan shudders. a rumble.}
