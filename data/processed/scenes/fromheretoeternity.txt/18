<B>__{medium shot the platoon}
<A>__{kneeling over their rifles, laid out on shelter halves. prew is featured in shot. his shirt is wet and he is sweating heavily, as if he has just come from the run around the track. henderson stands in front of the group, instructing.}

<D>__{ rifle's your beat friend. in case them weapons jams in combat could mean life or death. you got to know 'em inside out. now i want you to strip them weapons and put it together again.}

<B>__{medium shot prew and maggio}

<B>__{close shot prew}
<A>__{as he strips the rifle. (this mechanical operation should be interesting to audiences; a good man can field strip the weapon in thirty or forty seconds.) prew finishes the job and camera moves to close on shelter half where all the parts are laid out.}

<D>__{'at's fair time. now lemma see you put it together.}
<A>__{prew's hands start to work over rifle parts, putting them together.}
