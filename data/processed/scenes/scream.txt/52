<L>__{interior girl's bathroom}
<A>__{large and spacious. closed bathroom stalls line one wall facing a row of sinks and a huge mirror. sidney enters as two girls tinkle and talk each from their respective stalls.}
<D>__{girl #1 she was never attacked. i think she made it all up. girl #2 why would she lie about it? girl #1 for attention. the girl has some serious issues.}
<A>__{sidney listens intently. a toilet flushes. sidney quickly jumps in a stall, hiding, just as girl #1 appears from a stall. she looks like that voice a snotty little twit.}
<D>__{girl #1 what if she did it? what if sidney killed casey and steve? girl #2 and why would she do that? girl #1 maybe she was hot for steve and killed them both in a jealous rage.}
<A>__{another toilet flushes.}
<D>__{girl #2 why would sidney want to be with steve? she has her own bubble butt boyfriend billy. girl #1 maybe she's a slut just like her mom.}
<A>__{inside the stall sidney listens. her face weakening.}
<D>__{girl #2 you're evil. girl #1 please, it's common knowledge. her mother was a trollop.}
<A>__{girl #2 appears from her stall another twit. they both stand in front of the mirror adjusting two snotty faces.}
<D>__{girl #2 cut some slack. she watched her mom get butchered. girl #1 and it fucked her up royally. think about it. it makes perfect sense. her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's god, etc. completely suicidal. and one day she snaps. she wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. and homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression.}
<A>__{from the stall, sidney listens, her heart pounding, jaw quivering.}
<D>__{girl #2 where do you get this shit? girl #1 ricki lake.}
<A>__{the two girls exit. sidney moves out of the stall, catching her reflection in the mirror.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{pathetic.}
<A>__{water drips somewhere from a leaky pipe as wind whistles in from the cracked transom above the bathroom door. it sound almost like a whisper, "siddneey..." sidney spins around. what the... she checks out the bathroom. the doors to the stalls are all closed. she bends down and scans beneath them, looking for feet. no one. nothing. sidney turns back to the mirror. suddenly...}
<C>__{man}
<P>__{(o.c. whisper)}
<D>__{siddneey...}
<A>__{unmistakable this time. the voice strikes sidney like a nail through the eye. it comes from one of the stalls. she stands thunderstruck, eyeing the stalls thru the mirror.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{is someone there?}
<A>__{a long, morose silence. and then:}
<C>__{man}
<P>__{(softly, simply)}
<D>__{it's me, sidney.}
<A>__{sidney spins around. fuck no! he's here. terror floods her face. she eyes the exit door, then the row of stalls she must pass to get to it. she checks under the stalls again. nothing...where the fuck is he? she takes a step forward when... two feet step down from a toilet onto the floor in the last stall. sidney's face draws tight as the stall door begins to creak open. she bolts forward, making a break for it...but slips on the wet floor...her feet flying out from under... sidney reaches out...grabs hold of a sink...saves herself from falling...she glimpses a ghost mask in the mirror coming for her. a hand grabs her shoulder as she slams her body through the exit door...narrowly escaping.}
