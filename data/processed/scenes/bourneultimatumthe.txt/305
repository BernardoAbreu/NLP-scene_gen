<L>__{interior bourne's car day}
<A>__{bourne is home free. he looks around and spots a sign that indicates a right turn and says "to holland tunnel us}
<L>__{95." bourne turns right }
<A>__{suddenly the window next to his head explodes as two more shots rip through his door to tear a jagged wound into the top of bourne's leg. reveal paz, his suv racing along the curb lane. as bourne's car crosses in front of a small car stopped at the intersection paz swerves his car into that car and punches it into the side of bourne's car. bourne's car is knocked spinning, paz keeps charging forward and slams into the back of bourne's car. with his front tires spinning wildly bourne fights to straighten his car as another cri sedan appears and tries to box bourne's car by sliding into his path.}
