<L>__{interior com room}
<A>__{coffey is working rapidly and efficiently, moving from one rack of electronics gear to the next, setting thermite grenades at vital points. as the thermite ignites, it generates an intense arc bright light and tremendous heat. the circuit chasses melt. coffey works calmly in the infernal glare.}
<L>__{interior missle compartment}
<A>__{bed negotiates his way through the tangle of wreckage near the far end of the missile compartment. he goes down a stairwell to the lower level. a hundred feet away, jammer loses sight of bud's dive lights. he starts to get nervous. suddenly his own lights begin to dim, flickering lower and lower. they become little orange candles, the filament barely glowing. the darkness closes in.}
<C>__{jammer}
<D>__{bud? bud?! you readin' me? bud?!!}
<A>__{bud, at the same moment, is fiddling with the connector cables on his helmet lights, which are dimming and flickering. he hears nothing from his helmet transceiver. jammer, smacks the side of his helmet. shakes the transceiver on his belt. nothing... just static. then even the static dies. panic time. he grabs the safety line and pulls twice. hard. it is snagged on a sharp metal edge ten feet from him. he pulls twice more, harder, hauling the thing. the line severs. jammer stared at the frayed and floating toward him. his eyes bug. he looks all around in the darkness. can't see bud. can't decide what to do. we can see hysteria revving up inside him like a flywheel. then he becomes aware of a faint radiance flickering over the walls. it is a cold and ethereal light, unlike the warm white of their dive lights. it grows brighter. he turns slowly toward it. the glow is moving beneath the steel grill of the deck, sending shafts of cold light flickering upward hypnotically, coming toward him.}
<C>__{jammer}
<D>__{bud? is that you?}
<A>__{c.u. jammer, shielding his eyes, staring into the radiant source. guess what, jammer? it's not bud. in the brightest center of the glow, something is moving, a figure casting strange inhuman shadow across the walls. jammer blinks against the glare, his face registering total, outright astonishment melting into terror. the glare pulses subtly, hypnotically. the shifting shadow falls across jammer. he finally snaps out of his fixity... screaming and gulping air he spins away and starts clawing hand over hand through the treacherous wreckage. his harness catches on a twisted pipe. he struggles, totally out of control... the big man reduced to a blind panic. jammer heaves forward with all his adrenalized strength. he tears free of the entangling debris. launches like a torpedo... slamming his backpack full force into the top sill of the hatchway. his tri mix regulator takes the full brunt of the impact. on bud, swimming furiously back toward jammer's position. the strange radiance is gone. his dive light flare back to full brightness.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{jammer? answer me, buddy, jammer?!}
<A>__{he reaches jammer only to find him thrashing violently in place. a seizure. bud grapples with him.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{hang on, big guy. hand on!}
<A>__{catfish, sonny, and finler arrive from the corridor a moment later. they leap into the fray.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{he's convulsing!}
<C>__{catfish}
<D>__{it's his mixture! too much oxygen!}
<A>__{then they're all yelling at once, grappling with the big man, struggling with the valves on his breathing gear.}
<C>__{finler}
<D>__{crank it down, man! we're gonna losing him...}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{shit, it's stuck... goddamnit!}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{you got it?! you got it?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{yeah, yeah... yeah. it's turning.}
<A>__{jammer's convulsion ends. he goes limp.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{we gotta get him out of here. come on!}
<P>__{(to jammer)}
<D>__{hang on, buddy.}
<A>__{they drag jammer's slack form into the corridor, hauling their way rapidly back along the lifeline.}
