<A>__{the sky is grey with the first light of dawn. the wagon rolls off down the dark street as a dustcart rumbles into view and its crew begin emptying bins and picking up rubbish.}
<L>__{ext a holiday fair night}
<A>__{shooting galleries. music. loud aggressive rides. people milling around. the wagon is parked at the edge of the fair. the stage is set. anton dressed as mercury is trying to attract an audience, without much success.}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{step up! step up! for one night only! the imaginarium of dr. parnassus! not to be missed!}
<A>__{on stage is doctor parnassus, `levitating' and in a trance, as before. incense smoke swirls around him.}
<C>__{anton }
<D>__{test your imagination! envisage the sublime. let doctor parnassus be your guide. discover the heights of wisdom...}
<A>__{valentina dances forward, looking fabulous as `wisdom'.}
<C>__{anton }
<D>__{... or, if you will, visit the doldrums with all that's vile and stinks.}
<A>__{percy steps forward, once again in his mediaeval demon costume.}
<C>__{percy}

<D>__{take a ticket and wait your turn. twenty quid a go, reduced to five for one night only!}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{the world is full of wonders, beauty, enchantment, for those with eyes to see...}
<A>__{he magically produces a bouquet of flowers. throws it into the air.. it transforms into beautiful doves. this impressive trick is totally ignored by a group loudly arguing just in front of the stage the family from hell.}

<A>__{uncle bob laughs uproariously. linda pushes him into aunty}

<D>__{linda! beehave yourself! i'm warning you!}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{leave her alone!}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{please! this is the imaginarium! it requires respect, concentration... kindly go elsewhere and take your detritus with you?}
<C>__{mum}
<D>__{is he insulting us?}
<C>__{dad}
<P>__{(to the dr. parnassus, threateningly)}
<D>__{oy!}
<A>__{parnassus ignores him and resumes his trance. unnoticed by all, diego has somehow managed to climb onto the stage and is peering at the mirror.}

<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{diego!? where's diego?}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{diego!?}
<A>__{valentina turns her head just in time to see diego vanish through the mirror. she starts to go after him, then hesitates.}
<C>__{valentina}
<P>__{(trying to get anton's attention)}
<D>__{pssst!}
<A>__{anton looks across the stage to her. she mimes that a certain someone has gone into the mirror. anton considers waking doctor parnassus but thinks better of it. instead he heads off upstage and through the mirror in pursuit of diego. valentina takes over the pitch.}

<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, let dr. parnassus be your guide...}
