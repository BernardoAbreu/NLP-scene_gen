<L>__{interior midnite's office}
<A>__{john paces as midnite works on that universal orrery, adjusting components but balance continues to elude him.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{a few months, maybe a year. that's it. end of story. game over.}
<C>__{john }
<P>__{(as midnite doesn't react)}
<D>__{well, don't break down on my account.}
<C>__{midnite}
<D>__{what do you want from me? a shoulder to cry on?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{this bastard attacked me right out in the open on sepulveda no less.}
<C>__{midnite}
<D>__{they don't like you, john. you've deported how many back to hell?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{that's just it this wasn't some possession or wayward half breed, it was a full fledged demon. here. on our plane.}
<C>__{midnite}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i know what i saw.}
<C>__{midnite}
<D>__{you must have just crossed over and didn't even realize it }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i didn't cross over it was on this side. here.}
<C>__{midnite}
<D>__{ it's wet out, you're wandering around aimlessly, not to mention completely emotional }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{emotional?!}
<A>__{john slams a fist against the counter. the orrery almost topples but midnite saves it. decades of work almost lost. midnite glares at a desperate john.}
<C>__{midnite}
<D>__{okay, so you saw something. we've seen a few small ones slip through now and then.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{it's more than that... first the girl, then this.}
<C>__{midnite}
<D>__{john, you know my connections. any shifts or tremors in the planes and i'd hear about it.}
<A>__{john just shakes his head, looks up convinced.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{something's coming.}
<A>__{midnite sighs, gives up with him.}
