<LOC>__{INT LARGE, DARK ROOM NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{In the ebony shadows of a large room we can make out corners and edges, moldings and cornices; the phantoms of decaying Victorian wealth floating like disembodied ghosts in the darkness. It is May 6, 1924 The harsh flare of a match being struck A shadowy male figure lights a series of nine candles on a birthday cake. Beyond the cake we can see a bed. On the bed lies a woman in her early forties. She is ashen and sickly. Dying. The shadowy male figure finishes lighting the candles, blows out the match and disappears as the woman peers into the darkness.}

<ACTION>__{The boy immediately spins to the cake and blows out the candles. A moment of darkness. He turns back to the bed. The woman and the bed are gone, faded into darkness. The solemn young lad stares and stares into the darkness And then, magically, the faint glimmer of twinkling stars fill his huge dark eyes. NEWSREEL The flickering images of an old newsreel, circa 1940 Under the MGM logo we see the title: BOY WONDER WOWS HOLLYWOOD! The first image after the title is the imposing figure of ORSON WELLES, climbing down from an airplane and surveying the world at his feet. Welles is 24 years old and somewhat handsome. Welles seems rather uncomfortable in his own body, as if it could not possibly contain his vast passions and appetites. Orson Welles is man who tears his way through life with incendiary energy. He is at once inspiring and ferocious; visionary and coldly ambitious. He is part artist, part fraud and all showman. A sonorous voice accompanies the newsreel. The voice is always grand, occasionally sardonic.}

A compulsive gambler and drinker, Mank still glimmers with wry humor that is equally wicked and corrosive. He is incomplete without the stub of a cigar clenched in his teeth.

<ACTION>__{An explosion of color and an immediate swirl of sound We are in the Grand Refectory -- the mammoth dining room -- at San Simeon. Five long tables are placed end to end. There are about fifty sumptuously dressed guests. WILLIAM RANDOLPH HEARST and MARION DAVIES preside, side by side, at the center table. Hearst is 76 years old. He is a fully commanding figure, towering in both height (six foot two) and personality. He is shaped rather like a pear and moves with a delicacy surprising for such a famously merciless man. Although the word ruthless does not begin to do justice to the press baron's animus, Hearst is endlessly polite and almost painfully soft-spoken. Marion is 43 years old, a shimmering and lively presence. In a word that might have been coined for her, she has moxie. While the ravages of alcoholism have left their subtle marks on the edges and attitudes of her face, she can still charm and captivate with almost effortless grace. Around Hearst's feet sit a collection of his beloved dachshunds. On the other side of the main table, and down a bit, sit Welles and Mank. We sweep around the table, hearing bits of overlapping dialogue and finally settle on Marion and Hearst. Marion is charming CAROLE LOMBARD and CLARK GABLE, who sit beside her. She tenderly rests one hand on Hearst's arm as she speaks. Marion speaks with an occasionally pronounced stutter.}
