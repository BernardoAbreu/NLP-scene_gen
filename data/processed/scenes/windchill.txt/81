<T>__{back to:}
<L>__{interior stranded oldsmobile as before}
<A>__{and our girl finally surfaces from the dream as if coming up for air, with a huge gasp and eyes wild with fear. only to find herself in a waking nightmare. the car interior flooded with red. our guy terrified.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{what's happening!?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{it's him! hurry! help me!}
<A>__{she climbs up front to help our guy frantically taping over the vents. a shadow moves by the windshield and she gasps as another shadow goes by in a blur past the back window and he gasps the assault coming from everywhere at once now, the cop an elemental force, like the storm itself. skittering along the undercarriage one moment, across the metal roof the nexterior even appearing fleetingly, impossibly in the snow on the blocked driver's side window. all the electronics in the car start going crazy, power locks opening and closing, the interior light flickering, the dashboard clock hands spinning wildly, the windshield wipers sweeping back and forth, etc. then stop all at once. even the radio snaps off. dead silence for a beat. then an odd scuttling sound underfoot, something crawling along the undercarriage of the car. our guy sits there frozen with fear, too scared to move, to even breathe. likewise, the girl sits nervously, watching her breath in the cold. her eyes happen to wander to the rear view mirror a blue faced dead baby stares back at her from the rear window ledge. she swings around, looks back at the window. but nothing's there. she turns back, he looks at her with concern. unsure of her own senses, she shakes him off. exhales slowly. beat. suddenly the scuttling noises outside explode into to a full blown assault. there's the shriek of rending metal, the thing outside begins hammering at the car's hood, doors, etc. the car gives a violent shudder side to side tosses our kids around like plastic flakes in a snow globe. the radio snaps back on: the saxophone solo in the brenda lee song, accompanying the violent clangs and groans of metal being torn asunder as the thing under the car rips away muffler, brake lines, wrenches the handles from the doors, etc.}
<C>__{brenda lee}
<D>__{rockin' around, the christmas tree, have a happy hol i day...}
<A>__{our guy claps hands over his ears so he can't hear the sound of the cop's rage as he attacks the car, fury growing and growing until it's indistinguishable from the howling wind outside. the attack ends. the red police light in the rear window fades. leaving them sitting there in the dark in stunned silence.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i think... he's gone. i guess when he couldn't get in he gave up.}
<P>__{(suddenly grinning)}
<D>__{i told you these `88 olds were built like tanks!}
<A>__{he turns around in the front seat to shake a bandaged fist at the rear window.}
<C>__{guy }
<P>__{(nervous relief)}
<D>__{hah! next time pick on someone driving a hyundai }
<A>__{she claps a hand over his mouth.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{shhh! how do you know it's not a trick! he could still be out there waiting }
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{he's not! listen!}
<A>__{they sit in silence, listening, but hear only the wind.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{but what if he comes back..?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{we just have to stay in the car until morning. then we'll be safe. that can't be more than, like, a few more hours... someone's bound to come along once the sun comes up... someone human i mean. think you can hold on until then?}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(shy)}
<D>__{what if, you know. we have to pee?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{we can use the empty water bottles. from this point on, the back seat is a co ed bathroom. sound like a plan?}
<A>__{sounds like a plan.}
<C>__{guy }
<D>__{why don't you try to get some sleep? i will take the next watch.}
<A>__{she shakes her head, eyes full of fear.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{i don't want to sleep.}
<A>__{he nods, understanding. so they just hunker down in the front seat, staring at the snow covered windshield, and start the long wait to morning.}
