<A>__{a 1 los angeles a downtown intersection it is night, about two o'clock, very light traffic. at the left and in the immediate foreground a semaphore traffic signal stands at go. approaching it at about thirty miles per hour is a dodge 1938 coupe. it is driven erratically and weaving a little, but not out of control. when the car is about forty feet away, the signal changes to stop. car makes no attempt to stop but comes on through. a 2 a light newspaper truck is crossing the intersection at right angles. it swerves and skids to avoid the dodge, which goes on as though nothing had happened. the truck stops with a panicky screech of tires. there is a large sign on the truck: "read the los angeles times". the truck driver's infuriated face stares after the coupe. a 3 the coupe continues along the street, still weaving, then slows down and pulls over towards the curb in front of a tall office building. a 4 the coupe stops. the headlights are turned off. for a second nothing happens, then the car door opens slowly. a man eases himself out onto the sidewalk and stands a moment leaning on the open door to support himself. he's a tall man, about thirty five years old. from the way he moves there seems to be something wrong with his left shoulder. he straightens up and painfully lowers his left hand into his jacket pocket. he leans into the car. he brings out a light weight overcoat and drapes it across his shoulders. he shuts the car door and walks toward the building. a 5 entrance of the building above the closed, double plate glass doors is lettered: "pacific building". to the left of entrance there is a drugstore, closed, dark except for a faint light in the back. the man comes stiffly up to the doors. (camera has moved up with him). he tries the doors. they are locked. he knocks on the glass. inside, over his shoulder, the lobby of the building is visible: a side entrance to the drugstore on the left, in the rear a barber shop and cigar and magazine stand closed up for the night, and to the right two elevators. one elevator is open and its dome light falls across the dark lobby. the man knocks again. the night watchman sticks his head out of the elevator and looks toward entrance. he comes out with a newspaper in one hand and a half eaten sandwich in the other. he finishes the sandwich on the way to the doors, looks out and recognizes the man outside, unlocks the door and pulls it open.}
<C>__{night watchman}
<D>__{hello there, mr. neff.}
<A>__{neff walks in past him without answering. a 6 interior lobby neff is walking towards elevator. night watchman looks after him, relocks door, follows to elevator. neff enters elevator. a 7 elevator neff stands leaning against wall. he is pale and haggard with pain, but deadpans as night watchman joins him.}

<C>__{night watchman}
<D>__{how's the insurance business, mr. neff?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{night watchman}
<D>__{they wouldn't ever sell me any. they say i've got something loose in my heart. i say it's rheumatism.}

<P>__{(scarcely listening)}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<A>__{night watchman looks around at him, turns away again and the elevator stops.}

<P>__{(surly)}
<D>__{twelve.}
<A>__{the door opens. across a small dark reception room a pair of frosted glass doors are lettered: pacific all risk insurance company founded 1906 main office. there is a little light beyond the glass doors. neff straightens up and walks heavily out of the elevator, across reception room to doors. he pushes them open. the night watchman stares after him morosely, works lever, elevator doors start to close. a 8 twelfth floor insurance office (note for set designer: our insurance company occupies the entire eleventh and twelfth floors of the building. on the twelfth floor are the executive offices and claims and sales departments. these all open off a balcony which runs all the way around. from the balcony you see the eleventh floor below: one enormous room filled with desks, typewriters, filing cabinets, business machines, etc.) neff comes through the double entrance doors from the reception room. the twelfth floor is dark. some light shines up from the eleventh floor. neff takes a few steps then holds on to the balcony railing and looks down. a 9 the eleventh floor from above neff's point of view two colored women are cleaning the offices. one is dry mopping the floor, the other is moving chairs back into position, etc. a colored man is emptying waste baskets into a big square box. he shuffles a little dance step as he moves, and hums a little tune. a 10 neff moves away from the railing with a faint smile on his face, and walks past two or three offices (camera with him) towards a glass door with number twenty seven on it and three names: henry b. anderson, walter neff, louis l. schwartz. neff opens the door. a 11 interior neff's office dark three desks, filing cabinets, one typewriter on stand, one dictaphone on fixed stand against wall with rack of records underneath, telephones on all three desks. water cooler with inverted bottle and paper cup holder beside it. two windows facing toward front of building. venetian blinds. no curtains. waste basket full, ash trays not emptied. the office has not been cleaned. neff enters, switches on desk lamp. he looks across at dicta phone, goes heavily to it and lifts off the fabric cover. he leans down hard on the dictaphone stand as if feeling fainterior he turns away from dictaphone, takes a few uncertain steps and falls heavily into a swivel chair. his head goes far back, his eyes close, cold sweat shows on his face. for a moment he stays like this, exhausted, then his eyes open slowly and look down at his left shoulder. his good hand flips the overcoat back, he unbuttons his jacket, loosens his tie and shirt. this was quite an effort. he rests for a second, breathing hard. with the help of his good hand he edges his left elbow up on the arm rest of the chair, supports it there and then pulls his jacket wide. a heavy patch of dark blood shows on his shirt. he pushes his chair along the floor towards the water cooler, using his feet and his right hand against the desk, takes out a handkerchief, presses with his hand against the spring faucet of the cooler, soaks the handkerchief in water and tucks it, dripping wet, against the wound inside his shirt. next, he gets a handful of water and splashes it on his face. the water runs down his chin and drips. he breathes heavily, with closed eyes. he fingers a pack of cigarettes in his shirt pocket, pulls it out, looks at it. there is blood on it. he wheels himself back to the desk and dumps the loose cigarettes out of the packet. some are blood stained, a few are clean. he takes one, puts it between his lips, gropes around for a match, lights cigarette. he takes a deep drag and lets smoke out through his nose. he pulls himself toward dictaphone again, still in the swivel chair, reaches it, lifts the horn off the bracket and the dictaphone makes a low buzzing sound. he presses the button switch on the horn. the sound stops, the record revolves on the cylinder. he begins to speak:}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{office memorandum, walter neff to barton keyes, claims manager. los angeles, july 16th, 1938. dear keyes: i suppose you'll call this a confession when you hear it. i don't like the word confession. i just want to set you right about one thing you couldn't see, because it was smack up against your nose. you think you're such a hot potato as a claims manager, such a wolf on a phoney claim. well, maybe you are, keyes, but let's take a look at this dietrichson claim, accident and double indemnity. you were pretty good in there for a while, all right. you said it wasn't an accident. check. you said it wasn't suicide. check. you said it was murder. check and double check. you thought you had it cold, all wrapped up in tissue paper, with pink ribbons around it. it was perfect, except that it wasn't, because you made a mistake, just one tiny little mistake. when it came to picking the killer, you picked the wrong guy, if you know what i mean. want to know who killed dietrichson? hold tight to that cheap cigar of yours, keyes. i killed dietrichson. me, walter neff, insurance agent, 35 years old, unmarried, no visible scars }
<P>__{(he glances down at his wounded shoulder)}
<D>__{until a little while ago, that is. yes, i killed him. i killed him for money and a woman and i didn't get the money and i didn't get the woman. pretty, isn't it?}
<A>__{he interrupts the dictation, lays down the horn on the desk. he takes his lighted cigarette from the ash tray, puffs it two or three times, and kills it. he picks up the horn again.}
<C>__{neff}
<P>__{(his voice is now quiet and contained)}
<D>__{it began last may. about the end of may, it was. i had to run out to glendale to deliver a policy on some dairy trucks. on the way back i remembered this auto renewal on los feliz. so i decided to run over there. it was one of those calif. spanish houses everyone was nuts about 10 or 15 years ago. this one must have cost somebody about 30,000 bucks that is, if he ever finished paying for it.}
<A>__{as he goes on speaking, slow dissolve to: a 12 dietrichson home los feliz district palm trees line the street, middle class houses, mostly in spanish style. some kids throwing a baseball back and forth across a couple of front lawns. an ice cream wagon dawdles along the block. neff's coupe meets and passes the ice cream wagon and stops before one of the spanish houses. neff gets out. he carries a briefcase, his hat is a little on the back of his head. his movements are easy and full of ginger. he inspects the house, checks the number, goes up on the front porch and rings the bell.}
<C>__{neff's voice}
<D>__{it was mid afternoon, and it's funny, i can still remember the smell of honeysuckle all along that block. i felt like a million. there was no way in all this world i could have known that murder sometimes can smell like honeysuckle...}
<A>__{a 13 exterior dietrichson home entrance door neff rings the bell again and waits. the door opens. a maid, about forty five, rather slatternly, opens the door.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{mr. dietrichson in?}
<C>__{maid}
<D>__{who wants to see him?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{the name is neff. walter neff.}
<C>__{maid}
<D>__{if you're selling something }
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{look, it's mr. dietrichson i'd like to talk to, and it's not magazine subscriptions.}
<A>__{he pushes past her into the house. a 14 hallway dietrichson home spanish craperoo in style, as is the house throughout. a wrought iron staircase curves down from the second floor. a fringed mexican shawl hangs down over the landing. a large tapestry hangs on the wall. downstairs, the dining room to one side, living room on the other side visible through a wide archway. all of this, architecture, furniture, decorations, etc., is genuine early leo carrillo period. neff has edged his way in past maid who still holds the door open.}
<C>__{maid}
<D>__{listen, mr. dietrichson's not in.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{how soon do you expect him?}
<C>__{maid}
<D>__{he'll be home when he gets here, if that's any help to you.}
<A>__{at this point a voice comes from the top of the stairs.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{what is it, nettie? who is it?}
<A>__{neff looks up. a 15 upper landing of staircase (from below) phyllis dietrichson stands looking down. she is in her early thirties. she holds a large bath towel around her very appetizing torso, down to about two inches above her knees. she wears no stockings, no nothing. on her feet a pair of high heeled bedroom slippers with pom poms. on her left ankle a gold anklet.}
<C>__{maid's voice}
<D>__{it's for mr. dietrichson.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<P>__{(looking down at neff)}
<D>__{i'm mrs. dietrichson. what is it?}
<A>__{a 16 shooting down from upper landing neff looks up, takes his hat off.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{how do you do, mrs. dietrichson. i'm walter neff, pacific all risk.}
<A>__{a 17 phyllis}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{pacific all what?}
<A>__{a 18 neff}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{pacific all risk insurance company. it's about some renewals on the automobiles, mrs. dietrichson. i've been trying to contact your husband for the past two weeks. he's never at his office.}
<A>__{a 19 phyllis}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{is there anything i can do?}
<A>__{a 20 neff}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{the insurance ran out on the fifteenth. i'd hate to think of your getting a smashed fender or something while you're not fully covered.}
<A>__{a 21 phyllis she glances over her towel costume.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<P>__{(with a little smile)}
<D>__{perhaps i know what you mean, mr. neff. i've just been taking a sun bath.}
<A>__{a 22 neff}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{no pigeons around, i hope... about those policies, mrs. dietrichson i hate to take up your time }
<A>__{a 23 phyllis}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{that's all right. if you can wait till i put something on, i will be right down. nettie, show mr. neff into the living room.}
<A>__{she turns away as gracefully as one can with a towel for a wrapper.] a 24 entrance hall neff watches phyllis out of sight. he speaks to the maid while still looking up.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{where would the living room be?}
<C>__{maid}
<D>__{in there, but they keep the liquor locked up.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{that's okay. i always carry my own keys.}
<A>__{he goes through the archway. maid goes off the other way. a 25 living room neff comes into the room and throws his briefcase on the plush davenport and tosses his hat on top of it. he looks around the room, then moves over to a baby grand piano with a sleazy spanish shawl dangling down one side and two cabinet photographs standing in a staggered position on top. neff glances them over: mr. dietrichson, age about fifty one, a big, blocky man with glasses and a rotarian look about him; lola dietrichson, age nineteen, wearing a filmy party dress and a yearning look in her pretty eyes. neff walks away from the piano and takes a few steps back and forth across the rug. his eyes fall on a wrinkled corner. he carefully straightens it out with his foot. his back is to the archway as he hears high heels clicking on the staircase. he turns and looks through the arch.}
<C>__{neff's voice}
<D>__{the living room was still stuffy from last night's cigars. the windows were closed and the sunshine coming in through the venetian blinds showed up the dust in the air. the furniture was kind of corny and old fashioned, but it had a comfortable look, as if people really sat in it. on the piano, in couple of fancy frames, were mr. dietrichson and lola, his daughter by his first wife they had a bowl of those little red goldfish on the table behind the davenport, but, to tell you the truth, keyes, i wasn't a whole lot interested in goldfish right then, nor in auto renewals, nor in mr. dietrichson and his daughter lola. i was thinking about that dame upstairs, and the way she had looked at me, and i wanted to see her again, close, without that silly staircase between us.}
<A>__{a 26 staircase (from neff's point of view) phyllis dietrichson is coming downstairs. first we see her feet, with pom pom slippers and the gold anklet on her left ankle. camera pulls back slowly as she descends, until we see all of her. she is wearing a pale blue summer dress.}
<C>__{phyllis' voice}
<D>__{i wasn't long, was i?}
<C>__{neff's voice}
<D>__{not at all, mrs. dietrichson.}

<C>__{neff}
<D>__{with two f's, like in philadelphia. if you know the story.}

<C>__{neff}
<D>__{the philadelphia story. what are we talking about?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<P>__{(she works with her lipstick)}
<D>__{about the insurance. my husband never tells me anything.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{it's on your two cars, the la salle and the plymouth.}

<D>__{we've been handling this insurance for three years for mr. dietrichson...}
<P>__{(his eyes have caught the anklet)}
<D>__{that's a honey of an anklet you're wearing, mrs. dietrichson.}
<A>__{phyllis smiles faintly and covers the anklet with her dress.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{we'd hate to see the policies lapse. of course, we give him thirty days. that's all we're allowed to give.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i guess he's been too busy down at long beach in the oil fields.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{could i catch him home some evening for a few minutes?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i suppose so. but he's never home much before eight.}

<D>__{that would be fine with me.}

<D>__{you're not connected with the automobile club, are you?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{no, the all risk, mrs. dietrichson. why?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{somebody from the automobile club has been trying to get him. do they have a better rate?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{if your husband's a member.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{no, he isn't.}
<A>__{phyllis rises and walks up and down, paying less and less attention.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{well, he'd have to join the club and pay a membership fee to start with. the automobile club is fine. i never knock the other fellow's merchandise, mrs. dietrichson, but i can do just as well for you. i have a very attractive policy here. it wouldn't take me two minutes to put it in front of your husband.}
<A>__{he consults the policies he is holding.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{for instance, we're writing a new kind of fifty percent retention feature in the collision coverage.}

<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{that's enough from you, walter. get out of here before i throw my desk at you.}

<C>__{neff}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{what kind of insurance could he have?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{enough to cover doctors' and hospital bills. say a hundred and twenty five a week cash benefit. and he'd rate around fifty thousand capital sum.}

<D>__{mr. dietrichson would understand. i'm sure i could sell him on the idea of some accident protection. why don't i talk to him about it.}

<D>__{they're all tough at first.}

<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i want to ask you something, mr. neff. could i get an accident policy for him without bothering him at all?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{how's that again.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{that would make it easier for you, too. you wouldn't even have to talk to him. i have a little allowance of my own. i could pay for it and he needn't know anything about it.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{wait a minute. why shouldn't he know?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{because i know he doesn't want accident insurance. he's superstitious about it.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{a lot of people are. funny, isn't it?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{if there was a way to get it like that, all the worry would be over. you see what i mean, walter?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{sure. i've got good eyesight. you want him to have the policy without him knowing it. and that means without the insurance company knowing that he doesn't know. that's the set up, isn't it?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{is there anything wrong with it?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i think it's lovely. and then, some dark wet night, if that crown block fell on him }
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{what crown block?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{only sometimes they have to have a little help. they can't quite make it on their own.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i don't know what you're talking about.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{of course, it doesn't have to be a crown block. it can be a car backing over him, or he can fall out of an upstairs window. any little thing like that, as long as it's a morgue job.}

<D>__{i was raised in the insurance business, mr. keyes.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{yeah. in the front office. come on, you never read an actuarial table in your life. i've got ten volumes on suicide alone. suicide by race, by color, by occupation, by sex, by seasons of the year, by time of day. suicide, how committed: by poisons, by fire arms, by drowning, by leaps. suicide by poison, subdivided by types of poison, such as corrosive, irritant, systemic, gaseous, narcotic, alkaloid, protein, and so forth. suicide by leaps, subdivided by leaps from high places, under wheels of trains, under wheels of trucks, under the feet of horses, from steamboats. but mr. norton, of all the cases on record there's not one single case of suicide by leap from the rear end of a moving train. and do you know how fast that train was going at the point where the body was found? fifteen miles an hour. now how could anybody jump off a slow moving train like that with any kind of expectation that he would kill himself? no soap, mr. norton. we're sunk, and we're going to pay through the nose, and you know it. may i have this?}

<A>__{out of the shot the gun explodes once, twice. phyllis quivers in his arms. her eyes fill with tears. her head falls limp against his shoulder. slowly he lifts her and carries her to the davenport. he lays her down on it carefully, almost tenderly. the moonlight coming in at the french doors shines on the anklet. he looks at it for the last time and slowly turns away. as he does so, he puts his hand inside his coat and it comes out with blood on it. only then is it apparent that phyllis' shot actually did hit him. he looks at the blood on his fingers with a dazed expression and quickly goes out of the room, the way he came. d 21 exterior dietrichson home (night) neff comes out of the house. he closes the front door with his right hand. his left arm hangs limp. he takes a few steps down the walk, then suddenly hears somebody approaching. he moves behind the palm tree near the walk. a man comes up the steps towards the front door zachetti. just as he reaches the door, neff calls to him.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{hey you. come here a minute. i said come here, zachetti.}
<A>__{zachetti turns and approaches him slowly.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{the name is neff.}
<C>__{zachetti}
<D>__{yeah? and i still don't like it. what do you want?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{look, kid, i want to give you a present.}
<A>__{he takes some loose change out of his pocket and holds out a coin.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{here's a nice new nickel.}
<C>__{zachetti}
<D>__{what's the gag?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{suppose you go back down the hill to a drug store and make a phone call.}
<A>__{neff starts to drop the nickel into zachetti's handkerchief pocket. zachetti knocks his hand away.}
<C>__{zachetti}
<D>__{keep your nickel and buy yourself an ice cream cone.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{the number is granite 0386. ask for miss dietrichson. the first name is lola.}
<C>__{zachetti}
<D>__{lola? she isn't worth a nickel. and if i ever talk to her, it's not going to be over any telephone.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{tough, aren't you? take the nickel. take it and call her. she wants you to.}
<C>__{zachetti}
<D>__{yeah? she doesn't want any part of me.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i know who told you that, and it's not true. she's in love with you. always has been. don't ask me why. i couldn't even guess.}
<A>__{zachetti just stares at him. neff moves again to put the nickel into zachetti's pocket. this time zachetti allows him to do it.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{now beat it. granite 0386, i told you.}
<A>__{he motions toward the street below.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{that way.}
<A>__{zachetti goes slowly past him. neff grabs him and pushes him almost violently down the walk. zachetti goes out of shot. the sound of his steps dies away as neff looks after him. then, far off in the distance, the siren of a police car is heard. neff moves off through the shrubbery toward the side of the house where he parked his car.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{d 22 neff's office (night) the desk lamp is still lighted. outside the windows, the dawn is slowly breaking. neff is still clutching the horn of the dictaphone. there are eight or nine used cylinders on the desk beside him. a widening stain of blood shows on the left shoulder of his gray jacket. he is very weak by now, and his voice holds a note of utter exhaustion.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{it's almost four thirty now, keyes. it's cold. i wonder if she's still lying there alone in that house, or whether they've found her by now. i wonder a lot of things, but they don't matter any more, except i want to ask you to do me a favor. i want you to be the one to tell lola, kind of gently, before it breaks wide open... yes, and i'd like you to look after her and that guy zachetti, so he doesn't get pushed around too much. because...}
<A>__{suddenly he stops his dictation with an instinctive feeling that he is not alone in the room. as he turns in his chair the camera pulls back slowly. the office door is wide open. keyes is standing a few steps inside it. behind him, on the balcony outside, stands the night watchman and the colored janitor, peering curiously into the room over keyes' shoulder. slowly, and without taking his eyes off neff's face, keyes reaches back and pushes the door shut. neff hangs up the dictaphone horn. he looks at keyes with a faint, tired grin and speaks very slowly.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{hello, keyes.}
<A>__{keyes moves towards him a few steps and stands without answering.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{up pretty early, aren't you? i always wondered what time you got down to work.}
<A>__{keyes, staring at him, still does not answer.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{or did your little man pull you out of bed?}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{the janitor did. seems you leaked a little blood on the way in here.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{wouldn't be surprised.}
<A>__{neff makes a motion indicating the used cylinders standing on the desk.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i wanted to straighten out that dietrichson story for you.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{so i gather.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{how long have you been standing there?}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{long enough.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{kind of a crazy story with a crazy twist to it. one you didn't quite figure out.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{you can't figure them all, walter.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{that's right. you can't, can you? and now i suppose i get the big speech, the one with all the two dollar words in it. let's have it, keyes.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{you're all washed up, walter.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{thanks, keyes. that was short anyway.}
<A>__{they stare at each other for a long moment, then, with intense effort neff gets up on his feet and stands there swaying a little. his face is covered with sweat. his shoulder is bleeding. he is on the verge of collapse.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{walter, i'm going to call a doctor.}
<C>__{neff}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{what for? so they can patch me up? so they can nurse me along till i'm back on my feet? so i can walk under my own power into that gas chamber up in san quentin? is that it, keyes?}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{something like that, walter.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{well, i've got a different idea. look here. suppose you went back to bed and didn't find these cylinders till tomorrow morning, when the office opens. from then on you can play it any way you like. would you do that much for me, keyes?}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{give me one good reason.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i need four hours to get where i'm going.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{you're not going anywhere, walter.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{you bet i am. i'm going across the border.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{you haven't got a chance.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{good enough to try for.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{you'll never make the border.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{that's what you think. watch me.}
<A>__{neff starts to move towards the door, staggering a little, holding himself upright with great effort.}
<C>__{keyes}
<P>__{(in a voice of stony calm)}
<D>__{you'll never even make the elevator.}
<A>__{neff has reached the door. he twists the knob and drags the door open. he turns in it to look back at keyes' implacable face.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{so long, keyes.}
<A>__{neff goes out, leaving the door wide open. the camera follows his staggering walk along the balcony towards the elevator lobby. the sound of his breathing is so harsh and loud that for a moment it dominates the scene. finally he reaches the swing doors leading into the lobby and starts to push them open. at this moment he collapses. he clutches the edge of the door and as it swings around with him he falls to the floor. he tries to struggle up but cannot rise. in background comes the sound of a telephone being dialed.}
<C>__{keyes' voice}
<D>__{hello... send an ambulance to the pacific building on olive street... yeah... it's a police job.}
<A>__{there is the sound of the phone being replaced in its cradle. then there are footsteps growing louder along the balcony and keyes walks slowly into the shot. he kneels down beside neff.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{how you doing, walter?}
<A>__{neff manages a faint smile.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i'm fine. only somebody moved the elevator a couple of miles away.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{they're on the way.}
<C>__{neff}
<P>__{(slowly and with great difficulty)}
<D>__{you know why you didn't figure this one, keyes? let me tell you. the guy you were looking for was too close. he was right across the desk from you.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{closer than that, walter.}
<A>__{the eyes of the two men meet in a moment of silence.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i love you too.}
<A>__{neff fumbles for the handkerchief in keyes' pocket, pulls it out and clumsily wipes his face with it. the handkerchief drops from his hand. he gets a loose cigarette out of his pocket and puts it between his lips. then with great difficulty he gets out a match, tries to strike it, but is too weak. keyes takes the match out of his hand, strikes it for him and lights his cigarette.}
