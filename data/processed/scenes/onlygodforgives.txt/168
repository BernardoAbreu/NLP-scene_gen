<A>__{we track in on dimitri as he stares at chang, a rabbit in the headlights. chang slowly sits down next to him. talks to him in english.}
<C>__{chang }
<D>__{i need information.}
<A>__{phaiban spins a spotlight onto dimitri.}
<C>__{chang }
<D>__{and you're going to help me.}
<A>__{suddenly the atmosphere in the emptied club shifts. it's as if dimitri and chang are locked into some kind of surreal performance...}
<C>__{chang }
<D>__{whether you like it or not.}
<A>__{dimitri's body starts to shake in fear.}
<C>__{dimitri}
<D>__{it was an english woman she wanted you dead...}
<A>__{a beat. not what chang expected...}
<C>__{chang}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{dimitri}
<D>__{said you... murdered her son....}
<C>__{chang}
<D>__{who was she?}
<C>__{dimitri}
<D>__{i don't know...}
<C>__{chang}
<D>__{how did she know me?}
<A>__{dimitri shakes his head. he really doesn't know.}
<C>__{dimitri}
<D>__{she asked for you by name...}
<C>__{chang}
<D>__{and what's my name?}
<C>__{dimitri}
<D>__{chang }
<A>__{chang starts to circle him. dimitri's terrified. doesn't know what the fuck he's on about. suddenly he's grabbed from behind by phaiban. chang smashes a beer bottle and walks up behind dimitri...}
<C>__{chang}
<P>__{(in thai)}
<D>__{i see the way you look at my people. the way you abuse them with your eyes. for this, i take your sight.}
<A>__{he pushes the broken bottle into dimitri's eyes. gauges them out. dimitri screams hysterically calling out for his mother in russian...}
<C>__{chang }
<P>__{(in thai)}
<D>__{you live in my country, but you fail to learn our language. you don't even try. for this i take your tongue...}
<A>__{phaibun grabs dimitri's head from behind. chang presses down on his stomach with his knee and opens his mouth grabs hold of his tongue and with a blade slowly cuts it off. ...dimitri's screams become more like the howls of a dying animal... chang looks at him and his men release dimitri who stumbles around the room like a chicken without a head...}
<C>__{chang }
<P>__{(in thai)}
<D>__{you had opportunities. you could have chosen other paths... but you wouldn't listen... for this i give you silence...}
<A>__{chang grabs dimitri and pushes the knife into his ear. first one side, then the other. sound out. we can't hear dimitri's screaming. we can't hear anything at all. beat. music starts. painful and beautiful, but also tacky... the opening bars to one of dolly parton's classics. karaoke style.}
<C>__{nadee }
<D>__{if i should stay, i would only be in your way. so i will go, but i know i will think of you every step of the way.}
<A>__{and chang with his crew just stare at the tortured russian as he screams until his lungs are ready to burst.}
