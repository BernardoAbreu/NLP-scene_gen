<A>__{two gangsters stand on each side of vinny. they are joey "two tons" 40's, could have a second career as a sumo wrestler. nicky "the rake", 30's, thin a rail. they make a strange pair but they both have one thing in common: they are stone cold killers. standing in front of the them is frankie zammito, 30's, a wise guy, tough as they come. he wears a well tailored suit, black leather gloves and polished shoes.}
