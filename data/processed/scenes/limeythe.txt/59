<L>__{interior valentine's house. upstairs hallway. afternoon.}
<A>__{wilson has come up here. peeks into one room. moves along to another: the master bedroom. opens the door gently.}
<L>__{interior master bathroom.}
<A>__{adhara is still enjoying her bath.}
<L>__{interior master bedroom.}
<A>__{wilson enters. careful. aware that someone's in the adjoining bathroom. the soft ripple of water from in there. perhaps he even glimpses her through the door as he boldly looks around. he notices a video camera on a tripod, a cord running to the television. suddenly we hear the chirp of a cellular phone.}
<B>__{bathroom}
<A>__{adhara reacts.}
<C>__{adhara}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{she gets out of the tub and goes for the nearest towel. quickly wrapping herself, she exits.}
<B>__{bedroom}
<A>__{adhara enters and goes for her purse. she pulls the ringing phone out and answers it.}
<C>__{adhara}
<D>__{hello? hey! great. you got my message? yeah. no, crestview terrace, not crestview place. yeah, there's like three different ways up the hill; the quick way is to bear to the right. sure. okay. okay. 'bye!}
<A>__{she hangs up and begins toweling her hair. after a moment she stops. something isn't right. she looks around the room, and her eyes stop on the tv. her brow furrows, trying to place the familiar image on the screen: a girl towel drying her hair by the bed.}
<C>__{adhara}
<D>__{that's me.}
<A>__{she looks over to see the video camera, which has been turned on and pointed toward the bed. she's not sure if it's funny or creepy.}
