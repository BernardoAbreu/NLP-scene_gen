<L>__{exterior the hotel pool and outdoor bar day (dusk)}
<A>__{alex sits with a beautiful nicaraguan woman, 35, at a table as press corps members mingle. a man we will come to know as hub kittle, 40, dressed new york casual, table hops in the b.g. price sees alex and sneaks over to drop the time magazine over his shoulder onto the table in front of him. without looking up, alex knows price has arrived. he smiles.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{welcome to managua.}
<A>__{they shake hands warmly, and price sits down. price points to the cover as a beer is served.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{you have something to do with this?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{well... i thought of calling your photographs "pictures from a lost war"... i'm great at captions the new york editors loved it since none of them knew where the hell chad was anyway it legitimized their ignorance, got you a cover, me a feature, and packaged a class struggle in two words. nifty, eh?}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{nifty.}
<A>__{russell acknowledges isela cruz sitting with alex.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{i'm russell price.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i'm sorry... this is isela cruz. she works for the hotel and helps out as a translator.}
<C>__{isela}
<D>__{my pleasure.}
<A>__{in the background claire walks into the pool bar area she carries her handbag and some papers she stops short seeing price sitting with alex. she hesitates, starts toward them, stops, and sits down at the bar at the opposite end of the pool. price sees her, and she sees price. they pretend they don't. price turns to isela and launches into a stream of broken, chauvinistic spanish with his usual elegance.}
<C>__{price}
<P>__{(in spanish)}
<D>__{looks like you guys have a lot of bang bang down here, eh? little misunderstanding between the poets and the government?}
<C>__{isela}
<D>__{"misunderstanding?!" "down here" it's called a war. it started in nineteen thirty. before you were born.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{my spanish is a little out of shape what'd he say?}
<C>__{isela}
<D>__{he said he considers it an honor to be able to photograph our war.}
<A>__{price looks at each of them and decides not to push.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{russell's got a way with words.}
<C>__{isela}
<D>__{i can tell.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{you're a helluva translator.}
<C>__{isela}
<D>__{i know. i'm much in demand around here. will you excuse me? if you have any questions, just ask.}
<A>__{alex stands to help isela from her chair. price presses on, instinctively and effortlessly.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{who is rafael?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{it depends who you ask.}
<A>__{alex turns to isela, who stops as she rises.}
<C>__{isela}
<D>__{rafael? comandante rafael. he is either a marxist dupe of russia and cuba...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{...or the most popular leader of a most popular democratic revolution.}
<P>__{(to price cynically)}
<D>__{take your pick.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{i don't really give a damn... but the guy's got a great face.}
<A>__{a beat, then price asks his question almost sexually, as if he thinks he could seduce isela, rafael, the whole war.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{how would he like to be photographed?}
<C>__{isela}
<D>__{you'd never find him.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{wanta lay odds?}
<C>__{isela}
<D>__{you would lose.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you must excuse me.}
<A>__{she starts to leave again, and again he stops her.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{just one more thing is rafael owned by the c.i.a. or the k.g.b.? i will figure out the rest.}
<A>__{isela seems to welcome the question. her tone is less flip, and she focuses hard on price.}
<C>__{isela}
<D>__{mr. price... the world is not divided into east and west anymore. it is divided into north and south. by the time you people figure that out it will be too late.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{congratulations on your cover.}
<A>__{she touches his time magazine, kisses alex on the cheek, and floats magically through the pool area. price frames her with his fingers as if composing a shot. p.o.v. of isela through price's fingers isela kisses another journalist, grabs someone's hand, and lands gracefully at another table.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{so far this war's got it all over africa.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you're gonna have a ball.}
<A>__{alex places his hand over price's "frame" blocking out his view of the sexy isela. though alex's tone is gentle, the threat is obvious.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{hands off. i need an interpreter more than you do right now.}
<A>__{price takes the hinterior}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{you still hanging in there with claire?}
<A>__{alex chooses his words carefully and speaks slowly.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i'm hanging in there like an interim post war government waiting for the palace to be overrun... by younger men.}
<A>__{silence and an uneasiness that alex intended. price manages a smile.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{younger men.}
<A>__{alex smiles disarmingly. claire rises at the opposite bar, picks up her papers, and heads straight for the two men with a bounce in her step. both men are a bit surprised at her entrance and she hands a stack of mail to alex.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{hi, alex... russell! when did you get in?}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{just now.}
<A>__{she shakes price's hand in a friendly manner that comes out awkwardly, then races past the moment to address and entertain both men.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{you're not going to believe this i just beat you guys and everybody else here to a story...}
<P>__{(she teases them)}
<D>__{...exclusive... eat your heart out.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{what'd ya get?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i've just been promised a private interview with tacho.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{congratulations. the bastard won't talk to me.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{who's tacho?}
<A>__{they turn to price as if everyone knows who tacho is.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{that's president somoza's nickname.}
<C>__{price}
<D>__{i don't know who the players are yet.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{want me to order you a hot dog and a program?}
<A>__{a bit of tension and awkwardness claire quickly takes control and changes the tone.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{fellas! no fighting after six at night, all right? curfew.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{c'mon, we've all got something to celebrate.}
