<A>__{push in on a sleeping couple in the dark. the alarm clock reads 5:59 am. the woman's eyes open a second before the alarm beeps and turns it off. she grabs a glass of water on her bedside table and drinks it. climbs out of bed past typical bedside photographs (wedding, vacation, etc.). this is miranda grey: 30, sharp and prettier than she knows.}
