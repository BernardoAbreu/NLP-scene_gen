<A>__{he pulls the gun. brendan shouts and throws himself on tug's arm, wrenching it sideways. the gun clunks onto the carpet. the pin flips tug over and for a moment brendan is caught between them, hit and torn, rolling over the gun. tug grabs it, brendan grabs his wrist and the gun goes off, firing into the ceiling. plaster sprays. brendan screams, thrashing wildly, and manages to slip out of his bloodied jacket and out from between the two. the pin is on top, pinning tug's gun hand to the carpet, straining to keep it there. brendan leaps to his feet, staggers, then winds up and kicks tug in the wrist with all his strength. a terrible crunching popping sound. tug roars. brendan takes the gun from his limp hand.}
<C>__{pin}
<D>__{do him!}
<A>__{brendan backs off a few steps. the pin strains to keep tug down.}
