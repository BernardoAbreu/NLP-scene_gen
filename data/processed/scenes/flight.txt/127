<L>__{interior the st. jerome hotel whip's room night}
<A>__{hugh walks in to the center of the room and turns to whip.}
<C>__{hugh}
<D>__{well, whip we just wanted to make this as easy for you as possible.}
<A>__{whip puts his wardrobe bag down on the bed.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{just get a good night's rest. relax, order up a steak, get a movie.}
<A>__{whip is checking his phone. hugh gestures to charlie for him to leave so they can be alone.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{okay, cowboy, i'm out. the hearing starts at 10, so we should plan on 9 for breakfast here in the room.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{wait, charlie, thanks for letting me stay with you. i needed it.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you did great cowboy.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{you've got a beautiful family.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i'm very blessed.}
<A>__{charlie leaves and hugh joins whip at the window. hugh hands whip a thick folder.}
<C>__{hugh lang}
<D>__{i made you a copy of my entire file on you and the investigation. i also tried to anticipate what you might be asked under oath and i wrote out some non damaging responses. it's all in there; photos, testimony, interviews...i called ellen block let her know that you're here and all tucked in.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{so does she have the knife out for me?}
<C>__{hugh lang}
<D>__{remember she's limited in what she can ask you. you're not on trial but you are under oath. she's probably not happy that i killed the tox report, but you'll be fine.}
<A>__{whip laughs a little.}
<C>__{hugh lang }
<D>__{i will see you in the morning.}
<A>__{the two respectfully nod. hugh leaves and the door shuts behind him. whip puts the folder on the table and steps to the mini bar. he bends down and opens the fridge... whip sees the fridge is overly stocked with soda and juices. every soft drink you can imagine. no booze, anywhere. whip chuckles about the alcohol removal as he grabs a coke. whip unbuttons his shirt and pulls it out of his waist line.}
