<L>__{interior bar day}
<A>__{by contrast, a quiet bar. discreet music; a well dressed clientele. several couples occupy booths. other solitary drinkers are at the bar. amongst them: julia. now we see her more closely, we realize she's gone to some considerable effort to make herself ravishing. there's nothing crude about the change; it's a subtle transformation which shows off her considerable beauty. she drinks soda water. she has an admirer. sitting alone at one of the tables is a middle aged man by the name of prudhoe, a nervous, slightly paunchy individual. she glances over at him. his eyes don't leave her for a moment. he's trying his best to get the courage to approach her. she looks away, and concentrates on her drink. now she takes out a cigarette, fumbling for it. her hands are trembling slightly. she lights the cigarette, draws on it, and as she does so she seems to make up her mind that she's not the equal of it. she stubs the cigarette out, puts cash on the bar for her drinks, and gets up to leave. suddenly, prudhoe's at her side.}
<C>__{prudhoe}
<D>__{not much fun, is it?}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{prudhoe}
<D>__{drinking alone.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{not much.}
<C>__{prudhoe}
<D>__{i wonder, maybe ...}
<A>__{he's so nervous he can barely speak.}
<D>__{... as we're both on our own ... we could have one drink together?}
<A>__{julia looks at him. he seems to almost be offering himself to her. there's a long pause, while she tries to make up her mind. then:}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{why not?}
<A>__{she smiles. the smile works wonders. prudhoe's nerves diminish somewhat. julia's simply increase, now that she's committed herself. again, she opens the pack of cigarettes, as prudhoe calls the barman over.}
<C>__{prudhoe}
<P>__{(to julia)}
<D>__{what are you drinking?}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{just soda.}
<C>__{prudhoe}
<D>__{plain soda?}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{please.}
<C>__{prudhoe}
<D>__{i try not to drink at lunch time. makes me sleepy in the afternoon. you like to keep a clear head, eh?}
<P>__{(to barman)}
<D>__{one soda, one whisky.}
<P>__{(to julia)}
<D>__{i do it anyway. no will power. got a busy afternoon?}
<C>__{julia}
<P>__{(looking straight at him)}
<D>__{that depends.}
<C>__{prudhoe}
<D>__{oh?}
<A>__{he stares at her, not certain he interprets her correctly. she stares back. then: the tiniest of smiles, which he scarcely believing his luck returns.}
