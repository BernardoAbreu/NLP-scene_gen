<L>__{interior living room night}
<A>__{the cameras are all set up. the zenith console is now the centerpiece of this room. the rest of the furniture has been piled against the walls although we’re not sure if this is diane’s work or early poltergeist disturbances. tangina sees herself on the video monitor and smiles into the camera. she waves and watches herself waving on the monitor. she makes a funny face and gets a huge thrill at seeing it in black and white. diane and steve stand divorced from this. they have become bit players as tangina takes center stage.}
<C>__{tangina}
<D>__{can you make my face look bigger?}
<A>__{thinking this is a scientific request, ryan zooms in filling the monitors with tangina.}
<C>__{tangina}
<D>__{look at me for cryin’ out loud! you’d never suspect i was just a teeny little thing, would ya?}
<C>__{dr. lesh}
<D>__{tangina, could we get on with this, please?}
<A>__{tangina pulls out a lipstick and freshens her makeup, all the while watching herself in the monitor.}
<C>__{tangina}
<D>__{i’ve never been on tv before.}
<A>__{she steps back and looks into the camera. she adds to her already thick texas accent. the melodrama gushes out of her.}
<C>__{tangina}
<D>__{yes, it was me all the time, not that fussy harlot from the office. i shot j.r. ewing! i blew his little pecker right into the gulf of mexico. i...}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{oh, i swore on television.}
<A>__{no one is laughing. especially diane and steve. they are rather appalled. tangina immediately pulls back. she becomes an adult again and walks into the center of the room.}
<C>__{tangina}
<P>__{(to diane)}
<D>__{honey, c’mere and give me your hand.}
<A>__{diane hesitates and looks over at dr. lesh.}
<C>__{tangina}
<D>__{i’m not gonna bite’cha.}
<A>__{diane slowly walks to tangina and reaches down with her hand.}
<C>__{tangina}
<D>__{c’mon down here. you’re gonna give me whiplash lookin’ up at you.}
<A>__{diane smiles and kneels. she is eye level with tangina.}
<C>__{tangina}
<P>__{(softly, just for diane to hear)}
<D>__{your daughter is alive and in this house.}
<A>__{the tears come immediately. diane breaks down, sobbing, the first confirmation of her own belief from the outside. tangina hugs her, patting the back of diane’s head reassuringly. steve starts to come over to comfort but tangina waves him off and mouths...}
<C>__{tangina}
<D>__{... a glass of water.}
<A>__{angle dr. lesh she sits down and smiles. relieved, looks to ryan. ryan is filming it.}
<C>__{tangina}
<P>__{(to dr. lesh)}
<D>__{where was the last incident of “biolocation”?}
<A>__{dr. lesh points to the air just above tangina’s head.}
<C>__{tangina}
<D>__{i have my strongest feeling, the point of origin is inside the child’s closet. upstairs.}
<C>__{diane}
<P>__{(through tears)}
<D>__{yes. i feel that too.}
<C>__{tangina}
<P>__{(to diane)}
<D>__{now, honey. are you gonna be real strong for me? for your daughter? i can do absolutely nothing without your faith in this world and your love for the children.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{i will. believe me, i will.}
<C>__{tangina}
<D>__{will you do anything i say? even if it comes contrary to your beliefs as a human bein’ and as a christian?}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{oh yes. please.}
<C>__{tangina}
<P>__{(cupping diane’s face and}
<D>__{bringing their eyes}
<P>__{together)}
<C>__{tangina}
<D>__{then let’s get on our feet and go get your daughter.}
<A>__{diane laugh cries and rises. tangina starts to rise but then realizes...}
