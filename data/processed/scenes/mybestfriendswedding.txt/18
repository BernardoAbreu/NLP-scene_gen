<L>__{interior toilet stall day}
<A>__{julianne, fully dressed, sits on the closed lid of a toilet seat. the stall is tiny enough to arouse claustrophobia in an astronaut. her cellular phone pressed to her ear, she is listening angrily, smoking ferociously, every call in her body running at red line.}

<D>__{okay, okay, okay, okay, i hear you, all right?}
<A>__{she closes her eyes.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{it is stupid, dishonest, desperate beyond belief, and can't possibly ever work. it can only end in humiliation and disgrace. now can i say two words?}
<A>__{deep drag on the cigarette. for strength.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{do it! do it! do it! do it! do it! do it!}
<A>__{she's striped her gears. coughs horribly.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{all right, twelve words.}
