<C>__{mercury}
<D>__{deacon?}
<B>__{frost}
<A>__{stands with his back to us, his body trailing wisps of occult fumes. as he slowly turns, we catch a glimpse of his eyes burning with an awesome, inner fire.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{no longer.}
<C>__{blade }
<D>__{frost!!!}
<A>__{all heads turn }
<B>__{blade}
<A>__{stands at the balcony overhead, karen at his side. he leaps from it, somersaulting down to the floor below, landing on his feet like a predatory cat.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{who dies first?}
<C>__{frost}
<P>__{(growling, to the others)}
<D>__{take him.}
<A>__{quinn growls, stepping forward, armed with blade's punching dagger. he offers his second "new hand" up for view.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{grew another hand for you sweetmeat }
<P>__{(tossing the dagger to his new hand)}
<D>__{ and now i'm gonna kill you with it.}
<A>__{quinn charges. blade meets the vampire head on, dropping into a low kick and sweeping the vampire's legs out from under him. he spins behind quinn }
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{let's see if you can grow a new one of these!}
<A>__{blade hooks a finger through the metal ring at the end of his jacket sleeve, pulling out a retractable strangle wire which he twists around quinn's throat. blade tightens the wire, decapitating quinn. the headless body staggers about, then drops to the cavern floor. blade scoops up his punching dagger }
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{next?}
<A>__{mercury and the other faithful vampires charge en masse. blade launches a spinning wheel kick into the first vamp's face, snapping its neck mercury has blade's .454 casulls. she aims them at him }
<C>__{mercury}
<D>__{have a taste of your own medicine!}
<A>__{as she fires, blade tucks and rolls, knocking one of the guns from her hand. the guns spins across the floor, where it's scooped up by karen, who takes aim at an approaching vamp, blowing it away. meanwhile, blade traps mercury's other hand, disarming her, flipping her over his shoulder. he hefts his casull, blasting her into eternity a bloodbath ensues. blade moves like speed personified, firing off one, two, three headshots with brain numbing accuracy, cutting down the vampires where they stand. it's an orgy of gunpowder smoke and showering bodily fluids and click ca ching click! blade and karen have spent their bullets and }
<C>__{frost }
<D>__{enough!!!}
<A>__{blade turns to face frost, who's advancing, clutching blade's own sword in his hand. he thrusts the sword forward blade presses the grip trigger on his punching dagger ching! the two side blades spread out. we hear the rasp and clang of metal on metal as blade manages to trap the sword point between two of the dagger blades for a moment, both men are eye to eye, their weapons locked together, then, frost forces blade backwards what happens next is the most blindingly fast sword fight ever exposed to celluloid. both men, fueled by super human speed, lunge and spin across the cavern floor in a blurred ballet of lethal moves. frost lands a powerful blow on blade's shoulder, the sword edge biting deep into the flesh. blade screams. frost withdraws the sword for another strike until blade sees an opening and takes it, slicing frost's left arm off at the shoulder the severed arm releases blade's sword, but the arm doesn't fall! to frost and blade's mutual surprise the arm floats in mid air, bleeding red, quivering like zero g liquid, then slurping back to frost's arm stump to re attach itself! undaunted, blade slices the punching dagger into frost's mid section, meeting only liquid like resistance. the moment blade withdraws his dagger, frost's flesh seals itself up again. blade hesitates now, uncertain and frost laughs, understanding what has happened.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{you're too late, blade. i'm already changing. don't you see? the sleeper has awakened. i'm not just frost anymore. i'm becoming a god now, blood incarnate.}
<A>__{even as frost utters the words, his body begins to ripple and morph, bleeding red, taking on the characteristics of liquid. he doesn't walk so much now as flow. he's become a three dimensional creature of animated blood! a blood demon. on karen, as she watches frost's transformation, wide eyed. she sees blade's discarded sword, reaches for it suddenly, a shadow moves on the periphery of her vision }
<B>__{vanessa}
<A>__{rushes at karen in a near blur. the snarling hellion is upon karen in an eye blink, slamming her down against the temple floor, pinning her.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{did you think i'd forgotten you, you little whore?}
<A>__{back to frost, who towers above blade, swaying back and forth in his new, liquid like form.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{you can't hurt me anymore.}
<A>__{whoosh! frost rises upwards on a spiraling column of blood, howling with laughter, then just as suddenly splashes back to earth, spreading out in a widening pool. in the blink of an eye, he streams through blade's feet, re solidifying behind blade. blade spins, swings his dagger once again, frost morphs into blood form. he races around blade in a series of spouting arcs, turning from blood form to solid and back again in a series of split second transformations. blade whirls, striking with his dagger and missing every time whoosh! frost suddenly dissipates, splashing away into a million zero g blood bubbles, vanishing. blade spins, unnerved, trying to pin point his foe's next manifestation.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{where are you?!}
<A>__{frost's voice answers from all directions.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{everywhere.}
<B>__{a droplet of blood}
<A>__{spatters the floor at blade's feet. blade looks up }
<B>__{a shower of blood}
<A>__{rains from above, coalescing into frost as he sweeps down on blade like a giant bird of prey, crushing him against the temple floor.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{you want my blood so much?! take it!}
<A>__{frost's arms elongate and liquefy, flowing into two snake like spouts of blood the rest of frost remains solid. the blood spouts twist around blade's neck, melding together, completely encasing blade's head in a bubble of blood. blade claws at the blood bubble as if it were a solid object that he could dislodge, but his fingers just pass through it!}
<B>__{back to vanessa}
<A>__{as she wraps a hand around karen's throat, choking her. as karen struggles, she frees a hand, sliding it down to her hip pocket, digging something out whistler's vampire mace canister! she forces it up between them, triggering a jet of toxic mist into vanessa's face vanessa recoils, howling, her head smoking as if it were doused with formic acid, skin sloughing off from her skull. karen lunges for blade's sword }
<B>__{back to frost and blade}
<A>__{blade is drowning in frost's blood. his eyes bulge. oxygen bubbles stream from his mouth. frost leans in close, his face a twisted mask of insanity.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{i was wrong about you, blade. you were never one of us. you're a traitor to your race.}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{get away from him!}
<A>__{frost looks up karen is wielding blade's sword. she brings it down on frost, severing the blood tendrils which envelope blade. the blood bubble dissolves instantly, flowing away from blade's face. he gasps, chokes in air frost backs away, horrified. his blood tendrils don't reform. instead, the lay where they fell, solidifying into crystalline powder.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{blade!}
<A>__{karen flings the sword at blade.}
<B>__{the sword}
<A>__{spins end over end, its mirrored surface reflecting coruscating pinwheels of candlelight as blade catches the weapon by its hilt. blade rises, advancing on frost, sword outstretched and frost retreats, uncertain now.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{guess you're not quite as invulnerable as you thought.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{you're wrong a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. even your sword won't be able to affect me then.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{you don't have a few minutes, frost.}
<A>__{frost eyes blade warily, then lunges towards vanessa, sweeping behind her. blade follows, but even as he raises his sword to strike, frost spins vanessa around, using her body as a shield! blade hesitates, stopping the sword in mid strike, catching his mother's gaze her face is monstrous now, scarred by karen's poisonous mace. piteous, really. frost smiles, for he's found a final weakness of blade's to exploit.}
<C>__{frost}
<P>__{(laughing cruelly)}
<D>__{just as i thought. still chained to your mother's breast after all these years.}
<A>__{in the same instant, vanessa's features morph, taking on the angelic, youthful vibrancy she possessed in the locket photo.}

<P>__{(gloating)}
<D>__{you're too human, blade.}
<C>__{blade}
<P>__{(steeling himself)}
<D>__{it's because i'm human that i can do this.}
<A>__{frost's eyes widen in shock, but he has no time to react, for blade is already lunging forward, driving the sword point through vanessa's chest, on into frost's heart! it strikes the stone behind them, shattering and frost and vanessa howl as one, their screams rising to an unendurable intensity as the two vampires go nova, exploding into an expanding ball of light and atomizing blood. blade is thrown back off his feet, having to shield his eyes from the backlash of occult energy as a near tidal wave of blood surges over him }
