<A>__{ray begins to cry. jerry is incapable of dealing with it.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i will see you this weekend, okay? promise.}

<A>__{jerry blinks.}
<C>__{jerry}

<D>__{look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{don't make a joke of your life. go back and read what you wrote. you're better than the rest of them, better than the bob sugars, and don't forget it.}
<A>__{he shudders a little with the intimacy of her words. she kisses him, and moves quickly toward the car, leaving him alone in frame. he grows increasingly uncomfortable. he watches her leave.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{wait a second.}
<B>__{on dorothy}
<A>__{moving to her car. she hears him. it's not loud enough for her.}

<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i know a way to s... to save on medical and rent and... look...}
<A>__{he grips one hand with the other. dorothy looks at his strange behavior. he looks over to the cab, where ray is making a sad face at him through the window.}

<D>__{no no. don't do that. don't say that if you don't...}
