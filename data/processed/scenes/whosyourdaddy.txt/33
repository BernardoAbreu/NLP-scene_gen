<D>__{beauty? no. we're talking goddess.}
<A>__{ted's pov through binoculars a devastatingly perfect woman, ginger, "miss april," emerges from the pool, wearing nothing but a g string. her skin shimmers from the reflection of the pool lights. rivulets of water stream down her body. she reaches for a towel and pats her body dry. an incredible aura seems to surround her. separating her from the other spectacular beauties we've seen already. ted lowers the binoculars. entranced.}
