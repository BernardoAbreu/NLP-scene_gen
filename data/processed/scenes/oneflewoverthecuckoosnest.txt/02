<A>__{strange humming sounds, clanking pipes and hissing radiators as we see beds, with patients lying asleep, line two walls. the third wall is a heavy gauge steel grill, with a door that opens on to the day room. the door is open. on the far side of the day room, a long hallway with other doors opening into rooms: the latrine, washroom, tub room, mess hall, seclusion room, psychiatrist's office, visitors' room, etc. across the day room, a glass enclosed nurses' station where turkle, a negro night attendant, is seen preparing to go off duty. the camera pans the beds in the men's dorm. one man turns, another twists, a third lies as if dead. camera pan ends on bromden, who lies still, eyes wide open, very alert. he reaches down, plucks a stale piece of gum from under the bed frame, puts it in his mouth and starts chewing. a beat, then bromden carefully undoes the leather strap which binds him to the bed. he slips out of bed and quietly makes his way down the aisle, paying no attention to the other patients, some of who are beginning to stir awake. ahead, at the end of the hallway, the door opens and three negro day attendants, washington, warren and miller, dressed in white uniforms, enter and move down the hallway and disappear into a side room. bromden continues his silent journey towards the day room as turkle emerges from the side door to the nurses' lounge, goes up the hallway as miss pilbow, the day nurse, comes in, passing turkle on the way out. she crosses to the nurses' station and enters as bromden reaches the day room.}
