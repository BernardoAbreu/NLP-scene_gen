<D>__{he goes to church regularly he is very religious, and after hearing mass comes home to breakfast. then he takes an airing in his chariot till dinner, which is served at noon. after dinner, he writes his letters, if he has any letters to write; but he has very little to do in this way. his letters are to the austrian envoy, with whom he corresponds, but who does not acknowledge him; and being written in english, or course, i look over his shoulder. he generally writes for money. he makes his party with calsabigi, the lottery contractor, the russian attaches, two from the english embassy, my lords deuceace and punter, who play a jeu d'enfer, and a few more. he wins often, but not always. lord deuceace is a very fine player. the chevalier elliott, the english minister, sometimes comes, on which occasion the secretaries do not play.}
