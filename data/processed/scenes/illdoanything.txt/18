<T>__{long dissolve to:}
<A>__{same shot two hours later her hairdo wilted, her blouse soiled, her smile gone, the tendons of her neck prominent.}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(fiercely)}
<D>__{matt hobbs? matt hobbs!}
<B>__{on matt}
<A>__{going over his lines. hearing his name, he rises. claire gestures him in.}
<L>__{interior burke's office day}
<A>__{the walls are pockmarked with movie posters. three men sit in an area some distance from the desk. the casting director, martin, makes the introduction:}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{this is matt hobbs... this is john earl mcalpine, the director.}
<C>__{mcalpine}
<D>__{good to see you.}
<A>__{he speaks with an australian accent, gets half up and extends his hand.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{...and burke adler, the producer.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{so, what have you been doing with yourself...}
<P>__{(checking resume)}
<D>__{...the last few years?}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(to burke)}
<D>__{i'm real bad at interviews, so, if you don't mind, i'd really prefer to just read first.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{that's the way you want to do it?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{maybe we shouldn't even read. i will just take your word that you're good.}
<A>__{matt smiles.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{no. i'm serious. there's all different ways. did you know woody allen never reads actors? he just looks at them, feels around a little and then decides who he wants. that's his way. doesn't hear them do a line. i also have a way. what i do is interview first then read maybe do it all over again the next day. i call up people the actor has worked with check him out. if he's famous, i do an opinion survey to test how much people like him. if he's not famous, i put him on tape and show it to everyone i can grab. i believe in screen tests; i believe in replacing if the dailies are bad, in cutting people out if the previews aren't there. because i'm not doing movies for theaters where they serve cappucino in the lobby. i'm doing popcorn movies. you want to know what i like? come to my house, look at my lamps... you won't find it in my movies. in my movies, you'll find out what i know. i know how to do detail. what i don't know, i discover. yesterday we finished mixing a movie the last scene is in a field of windmills which blows up and all the blades of these windmills slice through the air, one of which hits a four story tank of propane gas. a humongous explosion scene. i kept on saying 'louder', and they finally said to me they couldn't go louder without distortion. we went louder. we had to discover a thing, a filter, but we went louder. i don't question doing these things. i do them. so if you want to know if it's okay to do it differently not to talk to just read first... i say...}
<P>__{(pointing to john earl)}
<D>__{ask him he's the director.}
<C>__{john earl}
<D>__{whatever.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{okay, let's do it. do you have any questions?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{they only gave me these two pages. i'd like to give this my best shot. so if i could read the script and come back...}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{this part works tomorrow.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{oh. who will i be reading with?}
<A>__{burke indicates martin.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(from his chair)}
<D>__{can i read from here?}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{i want you to do it wherever you're comfortable, but i'd prefer it if you were comfortable standing up.}
<A>__{matt rises uncomfortably. a secretary enters and hands a note to the director.}
<C>__{john earl}
<D>__{time for my buns to have visitors.}
<A>__{matt looks astonished as the director leaves the room.}
<C>__{burke}
<P>__{(to matt)}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{go ahead? the director left.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{that's okay, he trusts me, uh... and we're just doing the first page.}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(cueing him badly)}
<D>__{'okay, darling harry, here it is... if someone were breaking up with me, i'd like it short and sweet. what about you?'}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(reading showing pain)}
<D>__{'incredibly drawn out...'}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{'i can't take care of you right now. what am i, your mother?'}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(intense)}
<D>__{'well, what am i? your duck?'}
<A>__{as he gets into the scene he begins to experience some release of the desperate feelings he's been harboring.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(again)}
<D>__{'we've been together two years and you act like all you're doing is blowing away some feathers. so what i'm asking...'}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{you didn't do the quack.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{the stage direction says for him to quack.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i know, but why would he quack when someone's breaking up with him?}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{hopefully because it's funny.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{this isn't a comedy.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{then we're in trouble, because they're already fall down laughing at the teaser trailer in fifty two hundred and thirty theaters.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{a comedy?}
<P>__{(rubbing his face)}
<D>__{i think i have to make an adjustment here.}
