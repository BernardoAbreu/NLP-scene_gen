<A>__{the investigator immediately pulls a specimen bag from his jacket pocket and closely inspects the stainless steel toilet and sink. they are both spotless. the shower stall is also scrupulously clean. he flushes the toilet and exits. lost in thought, the investigator approaches the closet again and wheels out jerome's upright vacuum cleaner. he is disappointed a second time to find no vacuum bag inside. the investigator returns the vacuum cleaner to the closet and produces a mini vac from detective hugo's crime bag.}

<D>__{actually, the kitchen needs doing.}
<A>__{the investigator switches on the mini vac to take a specimen from the floor, then promptly kills the machine. looking down, the investigator notices the trail of eugene's perspiration on the highly polished floor leading to the spiral staircase. eugene, reading the investigator's mind, goes to call out but the words remain frozen on his tongue. hugo follows his superior as they start to descend the stairs. irene and eugene are left staring at one another.}
