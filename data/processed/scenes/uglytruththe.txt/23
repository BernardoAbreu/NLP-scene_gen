<L>__{interior kphx conference room day}
<A>__{abby and joy make their way into the conference room. dori and josh are already there.}
<C>__{joy}
<D>__{how did the date go?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i ended up pantsless in a parking lot.}
<C>__{joy}
<D>__{that's awesome!}
<A>__{stuart walks into the conference room.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{morning, everybody.}
<A>__{he puts a dvd in the player.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{now before i play this, i have to warn you...}
<P>__{(hits play)}
<D>__{...he's a little rough around the edges.}
<A>__{on tv: mike's face appears.}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{face it, you're ugly!}
<C>__{abby's voice }
<D>__{i am not ugly!}
<A>__{joy looks at abby.}
<C>__{joy}
<D>__{is that you?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{what?! no!}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{ugly people never know they're ugly. it's like people who have b.o. }
<A>__{abby grabs the remote and turns off the t.v.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{why are we watching this?!}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{one word. ratings. say hello to our new guest commentator. i'm starting him with two segments a week. three minutes a pop.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{are you kidding me?}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{who the hell is this guy?}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{his name is mike alexander.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{and he's a quintessential misogynist uber moron who represents everything wrong with television and society at large...}
<C>__{dori}
<D>__{i get crap every time i suggest we do something even remotely fluffy and now you're gonna put this douchebag on the air?}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{he's got a point of view. we don't have to like him, we're news people. we're objective. stone phillips interviews terrorists, doesn't mean he likes them. it's good for ratings.}
<A>__{abby holds up a piece of paper.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i've got a whole list of ideas on how to improve ratings. we don't need him.}
<A>__{stuart takes the memo, reading it.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{a live debate on immigration policy? never work.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{what are you talking about? albuquerque is 45% latino.}
<A>__{at this moment, mike walks in. abby stares at him, appalled.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{yeah, and as you can tell by all the screaming rugrats in this town, latino guys like to have a lot of sex. which means they'd rather listen to me tell them how to bang hot chicks than hear about why they can't bring grandma across the border.}
<P>__{(as they all stare at him)}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{sorry, i was eavesdropping out in the hall.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{see, what did i tell you? he's great.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{thanks, boss.}
<A>__{abby spins to face stuart.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{you already hired him?!}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(re abby)}
<D>__{who's this delightful creature?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{your superior.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{mmm...i like a woman on top.}
