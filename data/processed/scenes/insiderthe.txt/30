<L>__{interior a hotel room, louisville early evening}
<C>__{lowell }
<D>__{have you always lived in louisville?}
<A>__{brilliant late afternoon sunlight. we pull back to see jeffrey, standing by a window, silently looking outside to the left... lowell, cool, waiting, hands in his pockets, in the middle of the large room...}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{mr. bergman? what did you want me to consult about?}
<A>__{a sudden knock on the door...}
<C>__{wigand }
<P>__{(turns, suspicious)}
<D>__{who's that?}
<C>__{lowell}
<P>__{(wry)}
<D>__{that's room service. they usually knock first.}
<P>__{(calls)}
<D>__{come on in... over here, please.}
<A>__{room service brings in a tray with coffee. as lowell signs the bill, the room service waiter waiting, looks at wigand... their eyes meet... the waiter looks away.}
<C>__{lowell }
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{and the waiter leaves...}
<C>__{lowell }
<P>__{(pouring)}
<D>__{how do you like your coffee? black?}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{black, black...}
<A>__{lowell gives him his cup of coffee.}
<C>__{wigand }
<D>__{look, i really don't have that much time...}
<C>__{lowell}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{is there anything you want to know about me, mr. wigand...?}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{like what? your sign?}
<A>__{lowell smiles.}
<C>__{wigand }
<D>__{i know what i have to know.}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{just so i know you know, when i talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.}
<C>__{wigand}
<P>__{(abruptly)}
<D>__{how did a radical journalist from ramparts magazine end up at cbs?}
<A>__{lowell looks at him, he does his homework...}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{i still do the tough stories. "60 minutes" reaches a lot of people.}
<A>__{wigand's quiet, measuring him.}
<C>__{wigand}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{let me see the documents...}
<A>__{lowell gives him the box of papers... wigand sits down, the box on his lap, quietly looking through them...flips to a different heading, consults a chart...}
<C>__{wigand }
<D>__{...this is a fire safety product study for philip morris. burn rates...ignition propensity...things of this nature.}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{i could very easily explain this to you in layman's terms, because it's from another company...}
<A>__{he puts the papers down...}
<C>__{wigand }
<D>__{...but that's as far as i go...}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{far as you go where?}
<C>__{wigand}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{this issue is a drop in the bucket. i can talk to you about what's in here. but i can't talk to you about anything else.}
<A>__{and lowell knows something else is going on here...}
<C>__{wigand }
<P>__{(meaning philip morris documents)}
<D>__{i signed a confidentiality agreement. i honor agreements...}
<A>__{a lot more is going on here... lowell nods, a good reporter...}
<C>__{wigand }
<D>__{doesn't cbs have confidentiality agreements, mr. bergman?}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{between journalists and management, yes, i believe they do...but i don't take that seriously.}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{where do you work?}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{did work.}
<C>__{lowell}
<P>__{(fast)}
<D>__{did work.}
<C>__{wigand}
<P>__{(the bottom line)}
<D>__{how much would i get paid?}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{that, you have to discuss with cbs business affairs. but, for something like this, i would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.}
<A>__{wigand nods "okay."}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{should i just take the documents now?}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{if you want to do it.}
<A>__{he turns to leave... lowell gets the door for him... wigand momentarily slows...}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{i worked as the head of research and development for brown & williamson tobacco company. i was a corporate vice president. mr. bergman...}
<A>__{and he goes out the door... lowell's still. wigand's job title resonates. lowell turns to the window, casually looking into the early evening...and he comes face to face with what wigand was staring at, the brown & williamson tobacco company headquarters building, lit up right across the street...}
