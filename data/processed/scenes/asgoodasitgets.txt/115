<L>__{interior melvin's apartment living room night}
<A>__{melvin walks in anxious circles in the living room. he is impatient.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{you going to come talk to me or not?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i'm coming.}
<A>__{we enters the room carrying verdell who strains to be allowed closer to melvin. simon releases him.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{what did she say?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{i'm a great guy "extraordinary"...}
<P>__{(before simon can celebrate)}
<D>__{... and she doesn't want contact with me.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{i'm dying here.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{because...}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{... you love her?}
<C>__{melvin}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{no... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{okay... you tell me why }
<P>__{(mimics him)}
<D>__{"you're dying here."}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{i don't know... let me sleep on it and figure it out.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{because i'm stuck! can't go back to what i had... she's evicted me from my life.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{did you like it that much?}
<C>__{melvin}
<P>__{(furiously)}
<D>__{it was better than this... look, you, i'm very intelligent. if you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. if you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. i'm drowning and you're describing water.}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(getting pissed)}
<D>__{picking on me won't help.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{well, if that's true then i'm really in trouble.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{but you know where you're lucky?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{absolutely not.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{you know who you want. i will take your seat any day. so do something... don't sleep on it... go over there. i don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything it's not always good to let things calm down.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{hey... i'm charged here. but she might kill me for showing up this late.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{then get in your jammies and i will read you a story... i think you've got a chance. the only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever so go catch her off guard.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{okay. thanks a lot. here i go.}
<A>__{he moves for the door... stops suddenly, jolted.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{i forgot to lock the door.}
