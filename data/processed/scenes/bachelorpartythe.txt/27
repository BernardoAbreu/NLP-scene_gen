<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior. the bachelor's apartment}
<A>__{eddie is scowling over a home style movie projector, muttering over the intricacies of fitting a reel into the ratchets. arnold has suddenly become voluble and is gabbing away at him. camera dollies around them during the scene so that we can see into the living room of the apartment, appointed in simple but neat masculine taste, where the other three men move in and out of view. right now, we are concerned only with arnold and eddie.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{... we're moving in with her mother and father. i don't know if that's such a good idea. what do you think? we haven't got an apartment yet, and we figure we'll live a year with her folks, save on the rent, see?}
<A>__{kenneth comes back from the kitchen with three open bottles of beer.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{anybody want a bottle of beer?}
<C>__{arnold}
<P>__{(to eddie)}
<D>__{she's a widow, and that bothers me a little. i don't know why. she's two years older than me. i don't know if you know that. her husband got killed in korea. she's a cousin of mine, you know.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<P>__{(moving into the living room)}
<D>__{who wants a bottle of beer?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i will take a bottle.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{yeah, give me one.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{a third cousin, something like that. it's not good for cousins to marry, is it? what do you think of her? i know she's not terribly pretty, but i mean ...}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(muttering imprecations at the projector)}
<D>__{arnold, leave me alone a minute, will you?}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{sure.}
<P>__{(turns to the others in}
<D>__{living room, plants a}
<P>__{huge smile on his face)}
<D>__{well, i'm getting married sunday.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{having fun, walter?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{fun. a bunch of grown men sitting around waiting to look at college boy pictures.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{i swear, i never thought two months ago i was ever going to get married. i still don't know how it happened....}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{hey, somebody turn off the lights.}
<A>__{walter is promptly up to turn off the lights.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{hey, you know, you've got a nice place here.}
<A>__{the room is abruptly flooded in darkness. a beam of light shoots out from the projector. it seems pointed at the window. arnold stands up directly in the shaft of light.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{i was just taking her out. i didn't know it was so serious.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{arnold, get out of the way, will you?}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{oh, sure.}
<A>__{arnold moves a step, still in the shaft of light, his shadow huge on the wall. eddie, muttering, jockeys the projector around trying to focus it on the screen. the square of light and some flickering images wander up and down a wall.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{... we're sitting in the car, so she says: "well, arnold, we've been going together six months now. i think it's time we decided whether we were being serious."}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{hey, eddie, you got it on the window.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{i didn't know it was so serious. i didn't even know we were going together. i just took her out every now and then.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{arnold, you're funny.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{turn on the lights again, will you, walter.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i forgot to loop it over this loop thing.}
<A>__{walter crosses to light switch. the room is flooded in light again.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{oh, for crying out loud.}
<C>__{arnold}
<P>__{(small panic)}
<D>__{i can't even remember what she looks like! i just saw her this afternoon!}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{arnold, have a bottle of beer. it's not so terrible.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{boy, i tell you. it's for the rest of your life when you get married. this is a big decision to make.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{does anybody seriously want to see these movies?}
<A>__{eddie is furiously winding and unwinding spools. camera has dollied around so that we are looking back up the living room toward the projector and the men.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{i could be making a serious mistake.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{arnold, you're in the way again. come on now. all right, put off the lights.}
<A>__{the room is flooded in darkness again. walter hurries to a chair. the square of light is reasonably focused, just an edge trailing off onto the drapes of the window. numbers flicker quickly on on the screen. the rest of the scene we see looking into the whitened faces of the five men at their various posts. arnold crosses, stands back of walter.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{here we go.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{hey, arnold, if this is the one i think it is, there's one part here i want you to see.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(a picture of determined}
<D>__{boredom, but putting on}
<P>__{his glasses)}
<D>__{this is for kids.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{says he putting on his glasses.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{"the baseball game." that's a nice title, don't you think?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{this is the one, arnold. there's a guy in here who looks just like arnold.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{hey, she's not bad. usually, the girls in these things look like dinosaurs.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(his eyes glued to the screen)}
<D>__{a bunch of grown men ...}
<A>__{he breaks off as apparently some interesting action has started on screen. an involuntary grunt of acknowledgment escapes him.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i got these pictures off my dentist. i don't know where be got them. there you are, arnold, that's you.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yeah, it does look like arnold.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{doesn't that look like arnold?}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{who's looking at the guy?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{arnold, you've got a great career ahead of you.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{that girl looks like the girl charlie picked up just before.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{probably is.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{that fellow there is not a bad actor.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{actor. you could play that part pretty easy yourself.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{i think the daily news gave this one four stars.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i'd like to see this in three d.}
<A>__{the side comments drift off for a moment, and a sort of frozen attention settles on the white faces. each face is sort of set in a mold of determined disinterest, but the eyes are all watching.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{well, i will just watch one of them. then, i think i will just go home.}
<A>__{he wets his lips, lifts the bottle of beer to his mouth and takes a swallow. his eyes never leave the screen.}
