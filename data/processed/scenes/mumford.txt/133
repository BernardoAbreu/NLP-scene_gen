<L>__{interior courtroom, mumford county courthouse day}
<A>__{mumford is at the defense table. lionel is his lawyer. sofie, mr. cook and ben sit right behind the rail.}
<C>__{judge otto }
<D>__{the defendant will rise.}
<A>__{mumford and lionel stand up.}
<C>__{judge otto }
<D>__{sit down, lionel.}
<A>__{lionel sits down, squelched again. we see judge otto for the first time, a tough guy in his sixties.}
<C>__{judge otto}
<D>__{clarence norman white, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{judge otto}
<D>__{do you realize how insidious it is to invade the most private thoughts and secret lives of unsuspecting people?...}
<A>__{we see there's a pretty big turnout for this hearing. prominent among the onlookers: lily and skip, sitting together; nessa and martin, holding hands; dr. delbanco and mrs. delbanco. gilroy, from the state certification board, sits with the prosecutor.}
<C>__{judge otto}
<D>__{...people who have come to you with the faith that you know what you're doing... and that you are who you say you are?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{yes, your honor.}
<C>__{judge otto}
<D>__{it means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. you understand that?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{follett is sitting in one of the back rows, apparently alone. but now he looks down the row. althea is sitting down at the end in a stylish suit, completely appropriate, but a size too small. she gives follett a sidelong glance, then crosses her legs provocatively. whatever fantasy they're currently enacting is working really well for both of them.}
<C>__{judge otto}
<D>__{mr. white, i am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{i'm sorry, your honor.}
<C>__{judge otto}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{i'm sorry you're frustrated.}
<C>__{judge otto}
<D>__{are you disrespecting this court, mr. white?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{no, sir. i was empathizing. sorry.}
<C>__{judge otto}
<D>__{maybe you can empathize with this maximum fine. three months in jail, three months house arrest. sentence to begin immediately at the orchard valley correctional facility. case closed. this court is adjourned.}
<A>__{the judge slams down his gavel, stands up and stalks out. a deputy moves in to take custody of mumford. lionel stands up and leans in }
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{it's a country club. don't worry about it.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{thanks for your help, lionel.}
<A>__{mumford turns to face the cooks. mr. cook and ben shake his hand like he's just won something. lionel addresses them all with his usual self satisfaction }
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{i will have him out in half the time.}
<A>__{we push in on mumford and sofie, who embrace.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{you got off easy.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{will you wait for me?}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{we're only talking about six weeks.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{will you be here?}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{of course... i haven't got the energy to get out of town that fast.}
