<L>__{interior kaffee's apartment night}
<A>__{jo and sam are sitting in silence. it's dark outside.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{where do you think he is?}
<A>__{sam doesn't know. jo is beside herself, and trying to keep it together.}
<C>__{jo}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{as far as downey was concerned, it was an order from kendrick. it didn't matter that he didn't hear it first hand. he doesn't distinguish between the two.}
<A>__{sam understands, but he doesn't say anything. the door opens and kaffee walks in.}
<C>__{jo}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{danny. i'm sorry.}
<A>__{kaffee seems to be in an incredibly normal mood.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{don't worry about it.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{sam and i were just talking about how all we really have to do is call some witnesses who'll talk about implied orders... or maybe we put downey back on the stand before we get to dawson.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{maybe if we work at it we can get dawson charged with the kennedy assassination.}
<A>__{jo studies kaffee for a moment.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{are you drunk?}
<C>__{kaffee}
<P>__{(a simple answer)}
<D>__{pretty much. yeah.}
<C>__{jo}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i will make a pot of coffee. we have a long night's work ahead.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{she's gonna make coffee. that's nice.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he wasn't in his room.}
<P>__{(kaffee's amazed)}
<D>__{he wasn't even there.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that was an important piece of information, don't you think?}
<C>__{jo}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{danny, it was just a setback. i'm sorry. but we'll fix it and then move on to markinson.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{markinson's dead.}
<A>__{jo and sam are frozen. kaffee says this with no particular feeling one way or the other.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you really gotta hand it to those federal marshals, boy.}
<P>__{(he almost has to laugh)}
<D>__{it's not like he hanged himself by his shoelaces or slashed his wrists with a concealed butter knife. this guy got, into full dress uniform, stood in the middle of that room, drew a nickle plated pistol from his holster, and fired a bullet into his mouth.}
<A>__{jo and sam don't say anything.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{anyway, since we seem to be out of witnesses, i thought i'd drink a little.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{i still think we can win.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{then maybe you should drink a little.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{look, we'll go to randolph in the morning and make a motion for a continuance. 24 hours.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{why would we want to do that?}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{to subpoena colonel jessep.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{listen for a second }
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{just hear me out }
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{no. i won't listen to you and i won't hear you out. your passion is comforting, jo. it's also useless. private downey needed a trial lawyer today.}
<C>__{jo}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you chicken shit. you're gonna use what happened today as an excuse to give up.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{it's over!}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{why did you ask jessep for the transfer order?}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{what are you }
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{in cuba. why did you ask jessep for the transfer order?}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{what does it matter }
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{why?!}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{i wanted the damn transfer order!}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{bullshit! you could've gotten it by picking up the phone and calling any one of a dozen departments at the pentagon. you didn't want the transfer order. you wanted to see jessep's reaction when you asked for the transfer order. you had an instinct. and it was confirmed by markinson. now damnit, let's put jessep on the stand and end this thing!}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{what possible good could come from putting jessep on the stand?}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{he told kendrick to order the code red.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{he did?! why didn't you say so!? that's qreat! and of course you have proof of that.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{i }
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{ah, i keep forgetting: you were sick the day they taught law at law school.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{you put him on the stand and you get it from him!}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{yes. no problem. we get it from him.}
<P>__{(to sam)}
<D>__{colonel, isn't it true that you ordered the code red on santiago?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{look, we're all a little }
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{i'm sorry, your time's run out. what do we have for the losers, judge? well, for our defendants it's a lifetime at exotic fort levenworth. and for defense counsel kaffee? that's right it's a court martial. yes, johnny, after falsely accusing a marine officer of conspiracy, lt. kaffee will have a long and prosperous career teaching typewriter maintenance at the rocco columbo school for women. thank you for playing "should we or should we not follow the advice of the galacticly stupid".}
<A>__{and with one motion, he knocks everything from his desk. a ton of papers, books, files, etc., falls to the floor. there's dead silence. maybe just the sound of kaffee breathing after this exhausting outburst. finally...}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{i'm sorry i lost you your set of steak knives.}
<A>__{jo picks up her purse and coat and walks out. the door slams behind her. kaffee walks into the kitchen without a word. sam gets down on the floor and begins picking up all the stuff that kaffee knocked off the desk. kaffee comes back in with a bottle of jack daniels.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{stop cleaning up.}
<A>__{but sam continues.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{sam. stop cleaning up.}
<A>__{sam stops and sits in a chair. kaffee sits on the couch.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you want a drink?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{sam takes a swig from the bottle.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{is your father proud of you?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{don't do this to yourself.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{i will bet he is. i will bet he bores the shit outta the neighbors and the relatives. "sam, made law review. he's got a big case he's making he's arguing making an argument."}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i think my father would've enjoyed seeing me graduate from law school.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i think he would've liked that... an awful lot.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{did i ever tell you that i wrote a paper on your father in college?}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{he was one of the best trial lawyers ever.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{yes he was.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{and if i were dawson and downey and i had a choice between you or your father to represent me in this case, i'd take you any day of the week and twice on sunday. you should have seen yourself thunder away at kendrick.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{would you put jessep on the stand?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{you think my father would've?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{with the evidence we've got? not in a million years. but here's the thing and there's really no way of getting around this neither lionel kaffee nor sam weinberg are lead counsel for the defense in the matter of u.s. versus dawson and downey. so there's only one question. what would you do?}
<A>__{we hold on the two of them for a moment, then}
