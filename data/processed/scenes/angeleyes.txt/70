<L>__{exterior larry's house evening}
<A>__{it is early evening of the same day, and sharon is just off shift, out of uniform in her own car, parking on larry's street and walking to the door. she knocks and takes a step back. larry opens the door, already angry, his nose bandaged, eyes blackened a bit from the blow.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i don't want you around here.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{let's go talk in the yard.}
<A>__{they stare. she starts walking back into his darkening front yard, looking over her shoulder. she walks to a tree where the tire swing hangs, waits there. he goes back inside, but leaves the door open. in a moment he reappears, coming outside, closing the door behind him.}
<B>__{on sharon and larry}
<A>__{as they meet by the tire swing. his eyes burn her, hate and pain.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{you took a swing at me.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{you asked for it calling me a coward. you knew i'd swing. you think i look bad now? look at this.}
<A>__{he has a polaroid photo in his hand, holds it in front of her, dried blood and bad bruising on his face.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{nice, huh? beautiful. the cops'll love this, right? evidence. don't you guys love evidence?}
<A>__{he puts it in his pocket, and they stare a moment more.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{you wanted me to swing.}
<A>__{she looks away. she nods, speaks softly.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i'm sorry i hit you so hard.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{but you're not sorry you hit me.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{jesus, larry, what about kathy's face?!}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{that's not your business! nobody called you, right? she didn't ask for you to come here. this is my family. you don't get it, 'cause you've got no family. nobody. so you try to run everybody else's life. jesus christ get your own life. that's the goddam problem. get your own goddamn life.}
<A>__{their stare holds, but she is giving way.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{okay. i'm sorry i came here. i'm sorry i hit you. okay?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{okay what?}
<A>__{this is very hard for her.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{don't go to my department, all right?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{why the hell not?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{larry...}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{why not?!}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{because the job's all i got.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{that's what i said, right? no life.}
<A>__{she nods, her voice smaller, almost a whisper.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{that's what you said.}
<A>__{he makes her wait, thinking it over.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{and you won't come around here. you won't call. ever.}
<A>__{in a moment sharon nods.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{and i don't want you to come to mom and dad's celebration...}
<A>__{her eyes snap to his, surprised.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{not the church. not the party. stay away. i don't want you around. i don't want to see you, shar.}
<A>__{after another moment, she nods again and he snatches the photo out of his shirt pocket and pushes it against her chest and walks away. the photo falls to the ground. larry says without turning...}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{go get a life.}
<A>__{... and she snaps.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i got a life!}
<A>__{the words burst out of her, thick with tears, but she's not crying. larry stops and turns.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{how the hell would you know about my life?!}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{you know nothing about me, because you don't want to know. the family doesn't want to know me. well, too bad. sharon's got a life. sharon's got a boyfriend. sharon's going hiking in the morning with her boyfriend. she's not sitting alone miserable like you want. too bad!}
<A>__{she reaches down, snatches the polaroid photo off the ground, walks to her car, enters and slams the door as hard as it is possible to slam it.}
