<L>__{exterior merlin's camp continuous}
<A>__{merlin is sitting cross legged, deep in meditation. artie approaches him.}
<C>__{merlin}
<P>__{(chanting)}
<D>__{i'm a buzzing bee, buzz, buzz, buzz...}
<C>__{artie}
<D>__{mr. merlin, they need a spell to get them...i mean, us, back to far far away.}
<A>__{merlin stops meditating and looks out of the corner of his eye at artie.}
<C>__{merlin}
<P>__{(getting up)}
<D>__{forget it. i don't have that kind of magic in me anymore, kid. how about a hug instead? hmm? that's the best kind of magic.}
<A>__{artie tries a new approach.}
<C>__{artie}
<D>__{mr. merlin please. i know you can do it }
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{i said, forget it!}
<C>__{artie}
<D>__{but }
<A>__{merlin turns and starts to walk away muttering under his breath.}
<C>__{merlin }
<D>__{mumble, grumble, interrupt my healing. mumble, mumble.}
<A>__{artie thinks for a moment, staring at merlin. artie starts to sob. merlin stops and turns around.}
<D>__{shrek the third final screening script 77.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{oh. what, what's with you?}
<A>__{artie continues to cry.}
<C>__{artie}
<D>__{it's just so hard. you know? they really need to get back `cause their kingdom's in trouble `cause there's a really bad man and it's just so hard...}
<A>__{merlin is visibly uncomfortable.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{c'mon, take it easy.}
<A>__{artie's blubbering becomes frustrated and unpredictable.}
<C>__{artie}
<D>__{no! i don't think you understand! there's a mean person doing mean things to good people }
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{oh, have a heart old man!}
<A>__{artie grabs him, now desperate.}
<C>__{artie}
<D>__{and they really need your help to get them back! so why won't you help them?}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{artie speaks one last, indecipherable line. merlin is stunned. he doesn't know what to do.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{uh, okay... i will go and get my things.}
<A>__{merlin goes into his cave. artie immediately recovers. shrek is impressed.}
<C>__{artie}
<D>__{piece of cake. shrek the third final screening script 78.}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{well, well, well. you want some eggs with that ham?}
<A>__{shrek smiles. merlin returns holding a spell book.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{now, i am a little rusty, so there could be some side effects.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{side effects!?}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{don't worry, whatever it is, no matter how excruciatingly painful it may be, it'll wear off eventually... i think.}
<A>__{merlin cracks his knuckles. a bolt of lighting shoots out his hands and blows up a rock next to donkey.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{ah!}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{oops.}
<A>__{donkey and puss shoot shrek a pleading look.}
<C>__{donkey}
<D>__{are you sure this is a good idea?}
<C>__{shrek}
<D>__{look, if artie trusts him, that's good enough for me. even if his robe doesn't quite cover his }
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{alacraticious expeditious, a zoomy zoom zoom. let's help our friends get back, um... soon!}
<A>__{magic rays shoot out of merlin's fingers. shrek, puss, donkey and artie disappear in a puff of smoke.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{woah! it worked!}
