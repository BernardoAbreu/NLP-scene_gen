<L>__{interior foster home tv room}
<A>__{the room is back to normal, but not the occupant. freddy krueger now stands here alone. he has just peeled the wrapper off a pack of cigarettes of which wesley has become one.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{didn't daddy ever tell you what the surgeon general says...?}
<A>__{krueger reaches in and pulls the tiny wesley out of the pack. as before, wesley is immobile, helpless. freddy holds him between two fingers.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{smoking's bad for your health!}
<A>__{freddy looks around, as if searching for something, then beams as he reaches into the air and...}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{ah! a match made in heaven!}
<A>__{he produces a puny version of wesley's father in one hand. his body is straight and rigid, like a match stick. freddy places his thumb on the stiff man's head, and flicks his thumbnail, causing the man's skull to burst into flame, an evil grin spanning wesley's father's face. he brings the father match to what would be wesley's tiny feet, and lights the end. very close on freddy's hand wesley screams as freddy tosses the father match and brings the teenager's little head up to his fire scarred lips. the boy is enveloped by the massive cracked opening as freddy takes a huge drag off of wesley's head. where his feet should be, the tip of the wesley cig glows red, causing wesley to scream with supernatural pain. smoke billows from freddy's nose and mouth. he savors it.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{ahhhh! now we're smokin'!}
<A>__{he cackles horribly as he continues to suck on the wesley cig. with each puff, wesley's white wrapped body becomes slat black ash.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{what's your sign, wesley? it wouldn't be cancer, would it?}
<A>__{in between his demonic cackles, freddy drags on the wesley cig, each puff turning more of wesley into ash until all but his head is black and charred. freddy holds the wesley cig out, poised to tap the ashes loose.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{now say the secret word and you know what you'll win...}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{go to hell!}
<A>__{freddy grins.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{right...}
<A>__{and he taps the wesley cig with his finger. the ashes immediately fall, sifting in the air as wesley's head charred and black at the neck where it's been separated falls loose. wesley screams.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{noooooooo!}
<A>__{and his severed head falls and falls and falls.}
