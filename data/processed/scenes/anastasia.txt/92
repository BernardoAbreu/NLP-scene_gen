<A>__{anya spins to see an enormous bear emerge from the trees. (all the animals in the dream sequence have a slight resemblance to rasputin.) anya is frozen with fear as more bears emerge and head straight for her. she tries to back away as the beautiful flowers grow long and horrible thorns and wrap around her ankles, impeding her escape. it gets darker as the bear's eyes, glowing yellow, multiply and move closer. anya pulls free of the flowers and rushes to the safety of a large tree she climbs the tree and escapesthe bears. looking down, from her perch on a sturdy branch, the ground seems miles away. suddenly, the branch jolts her and almost falling, she hold on to it tightly. but the branch turns in toward her no longer a tree branch, but a huge ugly snake with red eyes and huge fangs that come right for her! anya leaps to another branch, which also turns into a snake. she jolts backward and begins to fall ... toward a hundred yellow eyes, fifty blood red mouths and thousands of sharp teeth. as anya falls, she lets out a silent scream.}
<B>__{a burst of sunlight}
