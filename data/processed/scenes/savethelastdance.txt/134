<L>__{exterior interior street bmw driving night}
<A>__{rap music blasts on the radio. no one in the car is saying anything. malakai has a "40" between his legs. he sips from it, passes it to patrick. patrick takes a short swig, passes it back to lip. as he does this, a set of keys fall out of his jacket into his lap. patrick picks them up. looks at the key chain, his present from sara. he looks at malakai.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{pull over.}
<P>__{(as malakai glances at him, not understanding)}
<D>__{this ain't helpin' nobody, 'kai. i'm out. i mean it. stop the car.}
<C>__{lip}
<D>__{awww, shit. here we go.}
<C>__{malakai}
<P>__{(furious)}
<D>__{what you mean you out? you think i'ma let your punk ass bail on me again?}
<A>__{patrick starts to open the door. malakai speeds up. the car careens down the street, squeals around corners. finally comes to a red light. stops. patrick starts to open the door. malakai grabs him by the jacket. pulls his gun. patrick looks at malakai and now he sees him. sees that he's lost and desperate... and dangerous.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{what you gonna do, 'kai? you gonna shoot me? go ahead! you'll have to!}
<C>__{lip}
<D>__{let him out! we don't need him.}
<C>__{malakai}
<D>__{shut the fuck up.}
<A>__{patrick jerks himself loose. opens the door. malakai cocks the gun. patrick's face flinches at the sound of it. he can feel it trained on his back as he gets out the car. but malakai can't do it. wouldn't do it. he takes off like a bat out of hell.}
