<D>__{francois wanted to torch the trailer where it sits, but i've convinced him a parking lot will reduce the risk of collateral damage.}
<A>__{the trailer clips the corner of the house. chunks of stucco fall and the galvanized downspout shudders and writhes, collapsing the long rain gutter running across the front of the home. nick guns it, and with a lurch the trailer splinters free. he dodges the birch tree, but plows over the smaller asian pear. the lincoln bounces the curb and catapults into the street, the trailer weaving back and forth, smashing parked cars.}
