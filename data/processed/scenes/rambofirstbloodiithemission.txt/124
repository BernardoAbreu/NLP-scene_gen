<L>__{exterior rain forest hill nearby}
<A>__{over the shoulder of co, watching from behind a screen of foliage as the ring of nva troops converge on the tiny figures of rambo, brewer and de fravio.}
<B>__{reverse}
<A>__{tight on co, her expression enigmatic. she turns and darts away, vanishing into the forest.}

<L>__{interior kirkhill's trailer}
<A>__{kirkhill is pouring scotch over ice in two glasses as the door behind him bangs open. trautman's expression could slice a steak.}
<C>__{kirkhill}
<D>__{have a drink.}
<A>__{kirkhill offers a glass to trautman who ignores it.}
<C>__{trautman}
<D>__{why?}
<A>__{kirkhill sets the glass down and sits at the dinette, motioning trautman to sit as well.}
<C>__{kirkhill}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{you got five hours? i will tell you about secretaries of state, and funding committees and diplomatic relations...}
<A>__{trautman slowly sits opposite him, his demeanor becoming more reasonable.}
<C>__{trautman}
<D>__{take your time.}
<C>__{kirkhill}
<D>__{look, colonel... we're all adults here. this is a war. a very quiet, very intense war. people get sacrificed.}
<C>__{trautman}
<D>__{not my people.}
<A>__{kirkhill freezes, glancing down. the muzzle of trautman's service .45 is jammed into his groin.}
<C>__{trautman}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{but you're right... some people do get sacrificed. now tell me why you pulled the plug.}
<C>__{kirkhill}
<D>__{you think i'm some whacko? i like to hurt people? i'm doing a job here. if i knew what's right or wrong i'd be a goddamned priest, right? so i follow directives... i do what i'm told. it's simple. if your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.}
<C>__{trautman}
<D>__{don't dance me, kirkhill. you'll be walking funny.}
<A>__{trautman leans on the .45 a bit and kirkhill backs into the seat cushion.}
<C>__{kirkhill}
<D>__{look, it was a screw up, alright? they weren't supposed to find anything. we thought that camp was empty.}
<C>__{trautman}
<D>__{this mission was a scam from the word go?}
<C>__{kirkhill}
<D>__{word came down... they wanted an answer. and they knew the answer they wanted: no pows. but it had to look good. best effort. the whole dog and pony show.}
<A>__{kirkhill takes a healthy pull from his scotch.}
<C>__{trautman}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{rambo and brewer were selected as write offs.}
<C>__{kirkhill}
<D>__{it was clean. very clean... rambo was a decorated vietnam vet, a former pow himself... if he came out and said "no pows" the sub committee would buy it. he gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own. if he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and d.c. airtight. but no... rambo's gotta be a hero. thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something. he put me in a corner. no choice.}
<C>__{trautman}
<D>__{"terminate with extreme prejudice."}
<C>__{kirkhill}
<D>__{that's a crock. we don't say that. do you have any idea the shitstorm if he'd gotten back with that guy? if it went public? the white house would have to act through channels. we're talking ransom. four billion bucks in war reparations to vietnam to get the others back. that's billion, colonel. with a "b". for a few guys that've had their brains in a blender for ten years? a pain in the ass to everybody? no way. there's no way.}
<A>__{the colonel has let the pistol drop, until it is dangling, forgotten.}
<C>__{trautman}
<D>__{so there never was a phase two rescue team?}
<C>__{kirkhill}
<D>__{of course not. you can't get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after tehran.}
<A>__{after a long silence, trautman nods.}
<C>__{trautman}
<D>__{i understand.}
<A>__{kirkhill relaxes. it's going to be okay. the colonel is one of the boys.}
<C>__{kirkhill}
<D>__{here. drink.}
<A>__{trautman doesn't take the glass.}
<C>__{trautman}
<P>__{(reasonably)}
<D>__{i understand your position.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i understand how a maggot like you can just slide out of a jam on a trail of slime. and call it expedience.}
<P>__{(viciously)}
<D>__{expedience!}
<A>__{kirkhill slams his empty glass down. his tone becomes self righteous.}
<C>__{kirkhill}
<D>__{you're out of your depth, trautman. way out. i'm acting correctly here. not you. not your gung ho jungle ace.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{it's over. walk away.}
<C>__{trautman}
<D>__{it's not over. you made one mistake.}
<C>__{kirkhill}
<D>__{what that?}
<A>__{trautman clicks the safety and reholsters the .45.}
<C>__{trautman}
<D>__{rambo.}
