<D>__{okay look, you and i are obviously at what they call a crossroads, so here's what's gonna happen }
<A>__{jack appears outside jamie's window and moves closer to get a better look.}
<C>__{jamie }
<D>__{if it wasn't a dream and if you are real, then you have to prove it. like right now. guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 108.}
<A>__{jamie waits. he looks around expectantly. jack looks on from outside the window, wondering if anything will happen.}
<C>__{jamie}
<P>__{(desperation creeping in)}
<D>__{i've believed in you for a long time, okay? like my whole life in fact. so you kinda owe me now.}
<A>__{jamie picks up his stuffed rabbit and holds it close.}

<D>__{anything at all.}
<A>__{he waits. it's excruciating.}
<C>__{jamie}
<P>__{(a whisper)}
<D>__{i knew it.}
<A>__{jamie lets the stuffed animal fall to the floor. jack comes into the room and watches as the light slowly fades from jamie's eyes, disbelief setting in. jack doesn't know what to do. he takes a moment to concentrate, then enters the room. then, jamie notices the window as the panes of glass freeze over. the image of an easter egg suddenly appears...}
<C>__{jamie}
<P>__{(seeing the window)}
<D>__{huh?}
<A>__{jamie looks down at the stuffed rabbit on the floor. he can barely comprehend what he's seeing. jamie looks back to the window as more of the window panes frost over. jamie's eyes get huge with amazement.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{he's real.}
<A>__{jack, excited, continues to exert himself trying to bring life to his drawing. and when he does, the frost rabbit comes leaping off of the window.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{whoa...}
<A>__{the rabbit hops around jamie's room, bursting like a snowball over jamie's head, the snowflakes sprinkling down on him.}

<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{whoa!}
<A>__{jack is as amazed as jamie. but jamie's amazement turns to confusion.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{snow?}
<A>__{a snowflake lands on the tip of jamie's nose. the snowflake glows a magic blue. and in that moment a light comes into jamie's eyes an idea starts to take hold.}

<P>__{(whisper)}
<D>__{jack frost?}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(a stunned beat)}
