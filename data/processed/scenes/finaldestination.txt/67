<L>__{int exterior garage clear rivers' house day}
<A>__{entering the garage, alex gets a closer look at her artwork. it's abstract sculpture and canvas work and pretty bad, at that.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{know what this is?}
<A>__{she gestures to him to approach her. he tenses, awkward, but moves closer. clear lifts a plastic cover off a canvas. beneath is a mess of green and brown and orange; teen angst poorly communicated. glued to the center is a twisted piece of metal.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{like, um... you're mad about something?}
<A>__{she sighs, "thanks a lot," then proud, but not enough to make her appear foolish over her bad artwork, indicates the metal.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{a piece of debris... from the plane. i went to the shore off the crash site and it washed up on the beach.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you went there? i've wanted to go there, but i thought it was off limits.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{it is. but that didn't stop me. shouldn't stop you.}
<A>__{alex gently touches the piece of the plane, almost expecting to feel something more than cold metal. he looks to clear...}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{why were you there last night?}
<A>__{while she cleans brushes with a can of turpentine...}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{look, i've seen enough t.v. to know the f.b.i. doesn't investigate teen suicides. but they were there last night, that means: one, they still don't have a clue what caused the crash. two, they haven't ruled out anything. and the fact that seven people got off the plane is probably weird enough, not to mention, that one of those people had a vision, or whatever, of it exploding minutes before it did explode, is highly suspicious. and it doesn't help that the visionaries' friend just committed suicide.}
<A>__{alex eyes her for a long beat. she turns away from him, returning the can of turpentine to a shelf.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{why were you there last night?}
<A>__{clear turns to alex. the two couldn't appear more different. she moves to a sculpture, an ugly black and green globular sculpture with a white dot in the center.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{know what this is?}
<A>__{alex, cocks his eyebrow probably thinking, "a mess?" but tactfully shakes his head "no."}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{it's you.}
<A>__{remaining dry and stoned faced, alex tenses, uncomfortable.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{not a likeness. it's how you make me feel, alex.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i'm... really sorry.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{like you, the sculpture doesn't even know what, or why, it is. reluctant to take form. and, yet, creating an absolute but incomprehansible attraction.}
<A>__{uncertain, and yet moved, alex listens.}
<C>__{clear }
<D>__{before that day, you were just another suburban nothing that would never have anything to do with my life. and i'm sure you thought i was some marilyn manson body pierced freak, or whatever.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but at that moment... on the plane... i felt what you felt. i didn't know where all those emotions were coming from until you started freaking out.}
<A>__{alex sighs, embarrassed.}
<C>__{clear }
<D>__{i didn't see what you saw, but i felt it. okay, i'm not into all that x files bullshit... but it was a psychic connection. why to me? why to you?}
<A>__{jarred, he eyes her, frightened.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{and you can still feel it, can't you? something from that day is still with you. i know, because i can still feel you.}
<A>__{alex is increasingly uncomfortable with the subject, but eased by clear's apparent, somewhat, understanding. lowering his tone...}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{that's why i was there last night.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i've never dealt with death before. i wasn't alive when my grandparents died. i wish i could know. i mean, all this... could just be in our heads. now it feels like it's everywhere.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{"it?"}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{what if tod... is just the first... of us?}
<A>__{the idea sends a shot of apprehension through clear.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{is that something you're "feeling?"}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i don't know. i wish i could just see him... one more time, then, maybe... i would know.}
<C>__{clear}
<D>__{then, let's go see him!}
<A>__{alex reacts, shocked and yet her impulsiveness is exciting...}
