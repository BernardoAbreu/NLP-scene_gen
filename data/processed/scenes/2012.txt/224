<A>__{jackson rips her out of harm's way, just in time. in a frenzy, he pushes her up the support arm where the others are already huddled on a small platform. as the towering wall of steel passes by them, inches from their faces, mr. pang loses his balance. jackson and lin both see this, but jackson is closer he grabs the old man by his arm, saving him from falling to his death. for the first time, lin acknowledges jackson with a nod.}
