<A>__{cortez prods at the corpse with his night stick, attempting to turn it over. a stream of maggots pours from the mouth and the cavity that used to be its throat. cortez jumps back in disgust and knocks against one of the several wardrobes in the cluttered room. another corpse flies out at him, as decayed and flvblown as the first. cortez draws his gun and empties it blowing the corpses head off, scattering flesh, mucus, and bone but no blood everywhere before realizing it is already dead. he realises what he has done and lowers his weapon sheepishly.}
