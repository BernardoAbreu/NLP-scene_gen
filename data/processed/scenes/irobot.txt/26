<L>__{interior metal corridor day}
<A>__{the steel arms of the robotic guard retract with a clang. the laboratory doors slide open.}
<L>__{interior hogenmiller's lab day}
<A>__{spooner and calvin step inside. it's dark. quiet. police and technicians long gone. silhouettes of hanging limbs. eyeless heads. clumps of wire and metal. the lights, flicker on. calvin sees spooner reaching into his coat with his left hand. pulling out a gun. reacts.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{a robot cannot harm a human being, detective. the first law of robotics forbids it. and we hard wire the three laws into every model. without exception.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{yeah, i saw the commercial.}
<A>__{spooner steps deeper into the lab. eyes scanning. twisting. to avoid touching any robot parts. passes a maze holding a metal insect. suddenly. the bug whirs to life. spooner startles. as the metal bug scurries through the corridors. clamps his hand down on it.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{and if a robot was given a direct order to kill?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{the second law of robotics would prevent it. a robot must obey an order only if it does not conflict with the first law.}
<A>__{spooner approaches a mound of robot parts. arms and legs. half torsos. all tossed haphazardly onto the pile.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{but a robot can defend itself.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{only when that action doesn't conflict with the first or second laws. this is the third law of robotics.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{yeah, well, you know what they say laws are made to be broken.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{not these laws.}
<A>__{spooner. starts nudging the pile with his shoe. calvin, growing impatient...}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{you're not hearing me, detective. there's nothing here...}
<B>__{when suddenly}
<A>__{the pile erupts in front of spooner...parts flying...as a robot leaps up from beneath it!... spooner...knocked back...his gun...skittering across the floor...right to... calvin's feet.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{dr. calvin!}
<A>__{calvin. stunned. speechless. the robot. fixing his illuminated eyes. right on her. she steps forward...}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{goddammit! stay back!}
<A>__{spooner. scrambling towards his gun. calvin. reaching out towards the robot...}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{calm down, detective. there is no danger here...}
<A>__{spooner. grabbing up his gun and wheeling round just as...}
<C>__{calvin}
<P>__{(to robot)}
<D>__{de activate.}
<A>__{and the robot. suddenly freezes. spooner. heart pounding. gets to his feet. training the gun on the robot. calvin turns to him.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{how did you know it was under there?}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{if i was metal and didn't want anyone to find me, i'd hide under a pile of junk.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{this robot wasn't hiding. what you're looking at is the result of clever programming. the illusion of self interest and free will. nothing more.}
<A>__{spooner. steeping closer to the robot. cautiously. holstering his gun. as calvin turns for the door.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i'm going to go get dr. lanning...}
<A>__{...the robot's hand suddenly shoots out...grabbing spooner's gun...from his holster...lightening fast...pointing it... right back at him... close on calvin. cannot believe this is happening...}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i said de activate!}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{move away from the door, doctor.}
<A>__{calvin's voice. cracking from desperation. confusion.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{commence emergency shut down!}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{now!}
<A>__{spooner. staring into the robot's eyes. a thin bead of sweat. trickling down his temple. calvin. moving away from the door...}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i...i gave you an order...}
<A>__{the robot. starts backing towards the door. the gun. shaking in its hand. as if he's desperate. conflicted. he touches the wall panel. the doors slide open. the robot steps out into the metal corridor. turning to run as the doors begin to shut... spooner. reaching down to whip out a back up gun. from an ankle holster. slapping in a large cartridge.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{this is impossible. a robot...}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{...can't do that. yeah, yeah, i know.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{my god did you see how it moved? i've never seen an ns 2 move that way...}
<A>__{starts running for the door.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{wait! please, you can't destroy it. we have to study it...}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{that thing took my gun. you'll be lucky if you get a handful of bolts back!}
<A>__{slams the wall panel and...}
