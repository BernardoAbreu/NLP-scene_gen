<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{okay london .... and five four three two one ...that's correct tom. today's gruesome ambush of a ten man belgian patrol has left the un peacekeeping force in a state of disarray. its commander has called for re enforcements. however, the general council is deeply divided. the united states, still smarting from the un's disastrous somalia mission, has indicated that it will veto any moves to reinforce. meanwhile, the slaughter goes on. gloria brooks in kigali, rwanda.}

<C>__{jock }
<D>__{holy shit! holy shit.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{jock focuses on the monitor: blurry focus of a shanty town on a hill. now focus: of a crowd hovering close to a group of rwandan tutsis seated on the ground. two militia emerge from the crowd, waving machetes. they slash their way along the line, savage, powerful blows, butchering people like cattle. (author note: we will use real news footage of this)}

<D>__{you fucking see that!}
<C>__{gloria}

<A>__{she storms out. paul fills the embarrassed silence.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i'm glad you filmed this. now the west will have to stop it. excuse me, gentlemen.}
