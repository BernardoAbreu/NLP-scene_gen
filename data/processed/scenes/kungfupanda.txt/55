<L>__{interior kitchen night}
<A>__{reveal po is cooking for the five. he chops some veggies mid air.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{...but you're a lousy tipper.}
<C>__{crane}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{really? so... how'd you get out of there alive?}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{i mean, i didn't actually say that, but i thought it... in my mind.}
<A>__{po flips some bowls and expertly lines them up on his arm. he ladles soup into them.}
<C>__{po }
<P>__{(covering)}
<D>__{if he... could read my mind, he'd have been like, "what?"}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{order up!}
<A>__{po looks around expectantly and the five (minus tigress) dig in.}
<C>__{po }
<D>__{hope you like it.}
<C>__{mantis}
<D>__{this is really good.}
<C>__{po}
<P>__{(bashful)}
<D>__{no, c'mon.}
<C>__{po }
<D>__{you should try my dad's secret ingredient soup. he actually knows the secret ingredient.}
<C>__{viper}
<D>__{what are you talking about? this is amazing.}
<C>__{crane}
<D>__{wow, you're a really good cook.}
<C>__{mantis}
<D>__{i wish my mouth was bigger.}
<A>__{the others laugh. but not tigress.}
<C>__{monkey}
<D>__{tigress, you gotta try this.}
<A>__{tigress looks up from her meal.}
<C>__{tigress}
<D>__{it is said that the dragon warrior can survive for months at a time on nothing but the dew of a single gingko leaf and the energy of the universe.}
<A>__{on the others for a beat. then po shrugs.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{i guess my body doesn't know it's the dragon warrior yet. i'm gonna need a lot more than dew. and, uh, universe juice.}
<A>__{po laughs. he picks up his bowl and takes a giant gulp. when he lowers the bowl, we see a noodle hanging from his face it looks like a moustache. mantis snickers.}
<C>__{po }
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mantis}
<D>__{oh, nothing... master shifu!}
<A>__{the rest start laughing. po realizes he's wearing a noodle moustache. he plays it up.}
<C>__{po}
<P>__{(imitating shifu)}
<D>__{you will never be the dragon warrior, unless you lose five hundred pounds and brush your teeth!}
<A>__{the five laugh.}
<C>__{po }
<P>__{(imitating shifu)}
<D>__{what is that noise you're making? laughter? i never heard of it!}
<A>__{the five keep laughing. po reaches over and grabs two empty bowls and holds them up like ears.}
<C>__{po }
<P>__{(imitating shifu)}
<D>__{work hard, panda. and maybe, someday... you will have ears like mine.}
<A>__{as the rest of the five laugh, tigress sneaks a moment to smell po's soup. leaning towards the bowl, she suddenly looks up and stops. the five also look up and stop laughing. reveal shifu has entered behind po. he is holding oogway's staff.}
<C>__{po }
<P>__{(normal)}
<D>__{ears. it's not working for you? i thought they were pretty good.}
<A>__{po looks at the stone faced five. tigress jumps to her feet.}
<C>__{monkey}
<D>__{it's shifu.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{of course it's shifu. what do you think i'm doing?}
<A>__{he finally notices shifu standing there, doing a slow burn. embarrassed, he places the soup bowls on his chest like a bra.}
<C>__{po }
<D>__{ooh! master shifu!}
<A>__{po slurps up the noodle moustache. monkey can't help but snicker.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{you think this is funny? tai lung has escaped from prison and you're acting like children!}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{he is coming for the dragon scroll, and you are the only one who can stop him.}
<A>__{the bowls fall off. a beat as this sinks in... then po starts to laugh.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{and here i am saying you got no sense of humor. i'm gonna stop tai...}
<A>__{shifu just stares at him, deadly serious.}
<C>__{po }
<D>__{what? you're serious? and i have to uh, master oogway will stop him! he did it before, he'll do it again.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{oogway cannot, not anymore.}
<A>__{they notice shifu holding oogway's staff. they know what this means. they are saddened by the news.}
<C>__{shifu }
<D>__{our only hope is the dragon warrior.}
<C>__{tigress}
<D>__{the panda?}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{yes, the panda!}
<C>__{tigress}
<D>__{master, please. let us stop tai lung. this is what you've trained us for.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{no! it is not your destiny to defeat tai lung. it is his.}
<A>__{he dramatically points at po... but po is gone.}
<C>__{shifu }
<D>__{where'd he go?}
<A>__{shifu throws up his hands in frustration and heads after po.}
