<A>__{andy is in a booth, arguing with a heavyset technician. zmuda watches and eats a banana.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{it's my show! now make it roll!}
<C>__{technician}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{maynard strolls up, buttoning his suit jacket, irritated as he walks around little wendy meditating in front of a ring of candles.}
<C>__{maynard}
<D>__{andy, i hear fabulous things about the special...}
<P>__{(a delicate pause)}
<D>__{eh, i understand we've hit a teeny speedbump?}
<C>__{technician}
<P>__{(harried)}
<D>__{yeah, kid genius told me to mess with the horizontal hold! he wants the picture to roll!}
<A>__{maynard doesn't exactly understand.}
<C>__{maynard}
<D>__{show me.}
<A>__{the technician pushes a button. on the monitor andy's image briefly appears.}
<P>__{andy (on screen)}
<D>__{and now... in her television debut, the incredible chubby rosalie!!}
<A>__{at that moment, andy's image starts rolling across the screen, until it disappears into a blur of static...}
<C>__{andy}
<P>__{(happy)}
<D>__{it'll be great. the viewer will think their tv is broken. they'll get out of their chair, they'll twist the knobs, they'll hit the tv, but they won't be able to fix it!}
<A>__{maynard stares at the monitor. the totally indecipherable picture still rolls. a glum pause.}
<C>__{maynard}
<D>__{andy... we don't want the viewer to get out of their chair. they might change the channel.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{but it's funny! it's a practical joke. they'll get frustrated!}
<A>__{andy beams giddily. maynard gazes dully, struggling to reason.}
<C>__{maynard}
<D>__{andy... uhh... this network has a long standing policy: the viewer must be able to see the program.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{but it's only for thirty seconds!}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{maynard}
<D>__{five.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{twenty!}
<C>__{maynard}
<D>__{ten.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{deal.}
<A>__{both men quickly extend their hands and shake. maynard nods and leaves. beat. then, andy pulls out a handi wipe and cleans his palm. a studio page walks over. he has a huge mail bag.}
<C>__{studio page}
<D>__{mr. kaufman, do you want your mail?}
<A>__{andy looks up and his face lights up like christmas.}
