<C>__{vince}
<D>__{hey, guys...}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{shhh! albert's gonna hump the coup de ville.}
<A>__{albert looks around at his friends. he surveys the back end of the cadillac with simian pride. then he expands his chest, thumps on it with both fists and yodels out a magnificent, mile carrying tarzan call. as the echo of it comes back the church bell begins ringing down the street and a group of excited bridesmaids come, hurrying up.}
<C>__{bridesmaid 1}
<D>__{albert, what are you doing!}
<C>__{bridesmaid 2}
<D>__{hurry up, you guys!}
<C>__{bridesmaid 3}

<C>__{bridesmaid 1}
<D>__{look at you! you're all a mess!}
<C>__{bridesmaid 3}
<D>__{put on their carnations!}
<C>__{bridesmaid 1}
<D>__{who's got a pin?}
<A>__{as the bridesmaids begin straightening ties and putting on carnations, nick hears someone call his name. he turns to find linda standing beside the trailer where she can't be seen. she looks pale and very frightened and she holds a small suitcase in her hand.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(crosses)}
<D>__{linda...}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{hi.}
<P>__{(forces a smile)}
<D>__{nick, your shoes are soaking.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{linda, what's the matter?}
<C>__{linda}
<P>__{(tries to toss it off)}
<D>__{oh... you know...}
<A>__{she fights against it but the tears begin to come. nick looks around, pulls her inside the trailer.}
