<L>__{interior the blandings' bedroom}
<A>__{muriel is still asleep as jim enters, walks over, nudges her.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{muriel.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{mm?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{coffee.}
<A>__{muriel awakens, sniffs the fresh coffee, smiles, sits up, takes the cup.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{thank you, dear.}
<A>__{they kiss briefly. muriel starts to sip the coffee as jim goes to his chest of drawers. it consists of several rows of small drawers above and large drawers below. jim ruffles through a couple of small drawers, pulls out a suit of underwear, continues noisily and with some annoyance to look through the other drawers.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{looking for something, dear?}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(briefly)}
<D>__{my socks.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{why don't you look in your sock drawer?}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(with restraint)}
<D>__{that's where i found my underwear.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{oh.}
<P>__{(brightly)}
<D>__{well, try your underwear drawer.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i'm in my underwear drawer.}
<A>__{he reaches in and holds up one of muriel's silk slips.}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(sipping coffee)}
<D>__{well, they must be somewhere.}
<P>__{(attempt at morning cheeriness)}
<D>__{socks just don't get up and walk away by themselves.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(strained patience)}
<D>__{muriel, i thought the top two and a half drawers were to be mine! i wish you'd tell gussie }
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{the closet! that's where they are. we put them in the closet.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{socks? in the closet?}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{well, there didn't seem to be any room in the drawers...}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{and there's so much of it in the closet!}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{...so gussie and i decided that from now on we'll keep them in a basket on the shelf.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{well, thanks a lot!}
<A>__{he strides angrily to the closet, opens the door, reaches up for the basket and pulls it off the shelf. as he does so, all the hat boxes come tumbling down knocking the basket from his hand, the socks spilling on the floor. about to explode, he looks at muriel.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{jim, i do wish you'd make an effort to be a little less clumsy.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(barely containing himself)}
<D>__{i will try, dear.}
<A>__{jim looks at her barely containing himself, and then puts the hats back in the boxes, jams them back on the shelf where they toter precariously. with bated breath he gingerly closes the closet door. pause. silence. he picks up a pair of socks and walks cautiously toward the hall door. suddenly there is a rumble and crash from inside the closet. jim exchanges a look with muriel, is about to say something, changes his mind, exits into the hall. muriel looks at the closet, sighs, takes another sip of coffee.}
