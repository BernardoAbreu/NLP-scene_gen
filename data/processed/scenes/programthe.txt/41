<L>__{interior athletic department conference room day}
<A>__{a meeting of the football brain trust; coach winters, athletic director, galen howard, a publicist, sharon braver, and the sports information director (s.i.d.) larry nichols. also present is joe kane, somewhat discomfited at being the center of all this attention.}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{i think both joe and the university are best served by a straightforward heisman campaign. nothing too gimmicky.}
<C>__{braver}
<D>__{we've compiled a mailing list of around 1300 opinion makers; newspapers, football writers, and sports anchors. first we send them a packet on joe and his achievements. bio, stats, plus human interest stuff; commitment to academics, charity work, etc. then we update it each week with a postcard. heisman voters hate opening envelopes.}
<A>__{joe is increasingly uneasy with all this.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i haven't really done any charity work...}
<C>__{braver}
<D>__{you're gonna start. we've got some things lined up.}
<C>__{nichols}
<D>__{unfortunately, because we weren't in the top 20 last year, we only have one network t.v. game to give joe national exposure. although it's a good one; michigan. but we'll also be taping all our other games and buying satellite time. that way we can produce our own highlight package and interview pieces and send them out to t.v. stations all over the country for their sportscasts.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{any questions, joe?}
<A>__{if joe was uneasy before, he's overwhelmed now. he tries not to show it. after all, who could turn down a heisman campaign? still it's a megaton of pressure.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{ah, no... i just... you really think i got a shot to win this?}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{hell, yes. plus it's a good thing for the program. publicizes the school, gives a boost to recruiting, and it's a great thing for you. jumps up your draft position, the size of your first contract, everything. it's a hell of an opportunity.}
<C>__{nichols}
<D>__{all you gotta do is back it up on the field, and we have no doubts about that, cause we know "kane is able."}
<A>__{nichols holds up a black campaign button with the phrase "kane is able" enblazoned on it in gold letters. this gets a rise out of everyone except joe, who's still not sure about all this.}
