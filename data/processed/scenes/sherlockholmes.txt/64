<A>__{holmes emerges as the beggar we saw previously. again he stops the coach and again the gun comes out, but this time we can see that holmes gets a view of the man on the other end of the weapon before the carriage pulls away.}

<A>__{holmes strums one more chord on his violin, thinking. irene's bag of money still sits on the table.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{this man intrigues me, watson. he's got adler on edge.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{which is no mean feat.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{she's intimidated, scared...}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{and yet she works for him. that's bad money. it's nothing to do with me, but leave this case.}
<A>__{holmes motions to the bills.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{well, i may not have a choice. a man has to make a living. after all, i will be paying the rent entirely on my own.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{you know what, i've had just about enough }
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{clarky!}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{mister holmes, sir...?}
<A>__{he turns to see... constable clark standing at the door. breathless, pale, scared.}
<C>__{constable clark}
<D>__{inspector lestrade asks that you come with me, at once.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(mumbles)}
<D>__{what's he done now, lost his way to scotland yard? watson, grab a compass. you means us.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{us means you.}
<C>__{constable clark}
<D>__{it's lord blackwood, sir. it appears he's come back from the dead.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{well that's clever seeing as how i pronounced him dead myself.}
<C>__{constable clark}
<D>__{a groundsman saw him walking through the graves, just this morning.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{i will leave this one in your capable hands. i have tea with mary and her parents this evening.}
<A>__{watson walks into his office.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{it is not my reputation at stake here.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{are you taking this seriously?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{like it or not, it's a matter of professional integrity. no girl wants to marry a doctor who can't tell if a man's dead or not.}
<A>__{they all move to the exit.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{watson, you'd do well to hide your medical certificates in case they're revoked.}
<A>__{clarky laughs.}
