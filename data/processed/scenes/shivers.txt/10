<L>__{interior annabelle's apartment morning}
<A>__{as soon as he is inside the apartment, tudor knows that something is seriously wrong. smoke hangs in the air and the smell of burned flesh attacks tudor's nostrils. he is on his way to the bedroom when he sees hobbes's foot around the corner of the dining room. tudor approaches the dining room with his hand over his nose and mouth. annabelle's corpse is still smoking where it lies on the dining room table. hobbes's body is twisted into the fetal position at the foot of the table, one hand still clutching the scalpel stuck in its neck, the floor beneath it bright with blood. tudor winces as though stuck with a pin. blinking rapidly, he edges around the room until his angle of vision is such that he can see the head of the corpse on the table. it is definitely annabelle, eyes still staring, surgical clip still attached to her lips, purple bruises on her neck. tudor turns, his body contracting around the pit of his stomach. after a moment he manages to straighten up and stagger from the apartment, having at least enough presence of mind to take his attache case, which he left by the door, and to close the door behind him.}
