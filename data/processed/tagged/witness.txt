<B>__{title sequence}
<A>__{the faces of several young children are presented in closeup, as they walk toward us across a ploughed field. on the sound track, the haunting sounds of a gregorian funeral chant. the camera pans up to the faces of older brothers and sisters, then to parents and grandparents. these are not familiar faces, but faces from another age, strong and open. all are dressed in the distinctive clothing of the amish.}
<L>__{exterior country lane day}
<A>__{through the last traces of early morning mist another group of black clad figures make their way down a lane.}
<L>__{exterior country lane day}
<A>__{an amish buggy, black and highwheeled, stark against the landscape, appears, a spirited chestnut in the traces. framed in the glass window of the narrow buggy is the stern figure of an amish man in black topcoat and flatbrimmed hat, his bonneted wife in muted colors, the face of a boy, attired like his father, peering out. the horse's breath smokes on the frosty air, the buggy creaks on its springs, and there's the rhythmic clip clop of hooves on the pavement.}
<B>__{another lane}
<A>__{two amish buggies reach a crossroads, join a procession of three others. they disappear as the lane wends through a leafless thicket of hickory.}
<B>__{valley}
<A>__{a big shot... now the procession numbers almost a dozen buggies... it is headed toward a distant farmhouse.}

<L>__{interior lapp farmhouse}
<A>__{partitions have been removed, making the central rooms of the farmhouse a spacious hall. the place is packed, a hundred fifty or more amish, all sitting in absolute silence on rows of wooden benches. a wooden coffin rests on a bench in the f.g., and near it the close relatives of the deceased occupy a special place.}
<B>__{rachel lapp}
<A>__{a young woman of perhaps twenty seven. her face is pale and drawn. in happier circumstances, although there haven't been too many of late in rachel's life, we would see a robust, sensual woman of full figure, spirit and intelligence. eight year old samuel lapp flits next to his mother; he would appear stunned, possibly not entirely comprehending events. and the patriarch, eli lapp; his stubborn, weathered yet not unkind features grief stricken.}

<D>__{his chair is empty, his bed is empty, his voice will be heard no more. he was needed in our presence, but god needs such men, too. that one should be taken so suddenly. treat sorrow. still, we would not wish him back. rather we should prepare ourselves to follow him.}

<A>__{the mourners have gathered about the grave, standing in silence as four pallbearers are lowering the coffin into the pit. the many buggies are aligned in the b.g. as the pallbearers begin to shovel soil and gravel into the grave, the preacher begins to read a hymn in german... a slow atonal litany which seems to hang forever on the frosty air.}

<B>__{daniel hochstetler}
<A>__{a brawny armed, ruggedly handsome, raffish looking amishman. there is something atypical about his face a slightly sardonic set of mouth, a bold eye, a prominent set of jaw. not exactly what old jacob ammann had in mind, maybe, but a well set up man nonetheless, and at ease among men. he's among a group of men including old stoltzfus, the local healer, fisher, bieiler and bieiler's stout young son, tom.}

<B>__{rachel}
<A>__{as hochstetler looms on the horizon, plants himself like a tree in front of her. at ease as he was with the men, he's a bit awkward at this. all the women, very much aware of hochstetler's availability, tune in as rachel looks up.}

<B>__{back to fight}
<A>__{as the struggle builds to a climax... ends with the young man stiffening with a grunt, his face draining of color. the two attackers step away, the blade in the black man's hand bloodstained. his partner stares at what they've accomplished with a stunned expression:}

<D>__{jesus...}
<A>__{the young man's hand comes away from his belly covered with blood. he stares at it, staggers toward the sinks. finally his bloodied hand reaches to smear at his face in the mirror. then he collapses to the floor. the black man motions for his partner to watch the door, then quickly reaches up and removes the notebook from behind the dispenser. angle in samuel's stall as he edges open the stall door a crack. over his shoulder we can see the black man, his back to us, rifling the backpack. but beyond him, in the mirror on the far wall, we catch sight of the black man's face.}
