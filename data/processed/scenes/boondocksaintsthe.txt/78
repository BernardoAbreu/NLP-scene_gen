<L>__{interior ritzy restaurant bathroom night}
<A>__{an old man appears to look at himself in the mirror of an empty but very upper class bathroom. his eyes are very glazed over. he puts a large leather case on the counter near the sinks. a red and white blind stick hangs off his right forearm. yakavetta enters, crosses behind him and stands next to him. augustus (72 years) sniffs the air. a look of angry realization overtakes his face.}
<C>__{augustus}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<C>__{yakavetta}
<D>__{hey, augustus, i need your help, i got a serious problem here. i'm not screwing around.}
<C>__{augustus}
<D>__{i bounced you on my knee at family reunions, for christ sakes. your dad and me ran the whole east coast syndicate you snot nosed little prick. and when you took the wheel, who was beside you?}
<A>__{augustus begins to remove items from his suitcase. first a plate. he sets it down next to the sink. then assorted colognes, cigarettes and chewing gum. he begins arranging them in neat rows, always feeling with his guiding hands.}
<C>__{yakavetta}
<D>__{hey, i just...}
<C>__{augustus}
<D>__{don't start with your shit. don't you talk to me. oh, hey uncle gussy, thanks for years of service. here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. what am i, a retired bus driver?}

<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what did you do?}
<C>__{yakavetta}
<D>__{this kid, this package boy could bring down the whole east coast. if he decides to turn states he could dismantle us... totally. but it looks like for now, he's content with just killing us one by one. and even worse the kid is good at it. i mean i had a prodigy on my hands the whole time and didn't even know it.}
<A>__{yakavetta puts an envelope of money in the plate.}
<C>__{augustus}
<D>__{listen kid, i think you better understand who you're dealing with here.}
<C>__{yakavetta}
<D>__{yeah. i was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.}
<C>__{augustus}
<D>__{your dad and i used him three times over twenty years, only when everything went totally fucked. believe me kid, you don't want this guy unless you are 100% sure you need him. he is... a fuckin' monster.}
