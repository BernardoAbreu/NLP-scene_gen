<L>__{interior precrime headquarters}
<A>__{anderson sits in a too large office in a too large chair. he abruptly rises and begins to pace. the room is large, but he paces like a lion confined in a cage. he punches an intercom. a female voice responds.}
<C>__{intercom voice}
<D>__{yes, director anderson?}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{where's ennis page? why hasn't he delivered this morning's precog discs?}
<A>__{ed witwer opens the door to the office., and casually walks in.}
<C>__{intercom voice}
<D>__{i will find him, sir.}
<A>__{ed shakes his head, smiles.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{bullying the staff again, director anderson?}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{screw you.}
<A>__{anderson turns away and stares out a large window. witwer joins him.}
<C>__{anderson }
<D>__{was that fun for you, yesterday?}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{the johnny palmer bust?}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{it was okay. we got our man.}
<A>__{anderson takes a long breath.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{when do we not get our man?}
<A>__{they turn as ennis page, 44, a thin, tight little man with burr cut hair, knocks and enters the room. he carries a black briefcase marked: "zone 218 washington alexandria, va." the case is cuffed to his wrist.}
<C>__{page}
<D>__{sorry i'm late, sir. precogs put out a heavy national volume this morning four for our zone.}
<C>__{anderson}
<P>__{(distracted)}
<D>__{put the case on my desk, ennis.}
<A>__{page hesitates, doesn't do it. anderson moves quickly to page.}
<C>__{anderson }
<D>__{what was i thinking.}
<A>__{anderson leans over the briefcase. a small panel recedes, a red laser scanner clicks on, scans anderson's eyes, beeps affirmatively, then clicks off. the cuff on page's wrist falls open. now page puts the case on anderson's desk. page hesitates. anderson and witwer know just what he's going to do. page reaches down, unable to resist straightening a pile of papers strewn on anderson's desk. anderson and witwer exchange knowing smiles. when page looks up they try to cover, but are not quick enough. he frowns tightly, and heads for the door. anderson calls after him.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{thanks, ennis.}
<A>__{witwer turns to leave, too.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{now that's a guy who really cares.}
<A>__{witwer grins to himself as he walks out of the office. anderson takes a deep breath and goes to his desk, and opens the briefcase. four small bright discs sit in rows. he removes one, places it in a video monitor that lifts into view from the center of his desk. he sits back, weary, and watches.}
<B>__{video screen}
<A>__{a young black woman stands in a hallway. she stares at a door, gun in hand. she opens the door, enters a bedroom. she glides toward a bed, where a man lies sleeping. she lifts the gun and fires it into his sleeping form. anderson pops the disc, jots down some notes, pops in a new disc.}
<B>__{video screen}
<A>__{a white woman stands at a stove, cooking. a man comes up behind her slowly, silently, a necktie taut between his hands. he raises the necktie toward her neck}
<B>__{anderson}
<A>__{he's not watching the screen. he is out of his chair now, looking out the window.}
