<L>__{interior insert stage early evening}
<A>__{guido walks forward and sits by the camera, as suddenly there's a commotion at the studio door, and lilli and some of her assistants come through, silhouettes only, followed by a tall figure, who demands the space around her. as the others walk towards a holding area with costumes, and wigs and all manner of items, the woman, who is claudia, of course, simply walks into the light, her home, and stands there waiting for guido. she looks stunning and glamorous. the epitome of a sixties movie star. guido gets up and approaches claudia. pierpaolo acts as first assistant director.}
<C>__{pierpaolo}
<D>__{silence please. se gira. and we are rolling.}
<A>__{guido gets behind the camera and films claudia's test.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{could you turn to the right please, claudia.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{yes, i can turn to my right.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{and can you turn to the left.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{yes, i can turn to my left.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{now just one slow turn for us.}
<C>__{claudia}
<P>__{(she turns around)}
<D>__{okay, one slow turn.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{bellissima. brava. cut.}
<C>__{pierpaolo}
<D>__{we've got it. next costume please.}
<A>__{makeup artists and costume assistants immediately surround her, loosening her hair. dante is thrilled. fausto is also mesmerised. she's a star, that's the long and short of it. and she's warming up for a fight with her director. another litany of jibes, half joking, but dangerous.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{has anybody got a script? script missing, handsome reward.... lost, one script, title italia. can't make a film without it...}
<A>__{lilli comes forward, puts a chinchilla fur coat on claudia, adjusts her hair.}
<C>__{claudia }
<D>__{so interesting to do hair and makeup for a part when you don't know what the part is.}
<A>__{guido adores her, her spirit, her feistiness.}
<C>__{claudia }
<P>__{(shrugs off the coat)}
<D>__{no! i'm going back to my hotel now.}
<C>__{pierpaolo}
<P>__{(anxious)}
<D>__{but please, just a couple more costumes, claudia.}
<C>__{claudia}
<P>__{(to guido)}
<D>__{i'm going back to my hotel now, my darling, and when i there is a script, i will read it and then we'll take it from there.}
<P>__{(calls over to lilli)}
<D>__{i love the costumes, lilli. they are beautiful.}
<P>__{(back to the guys, sweetly)}
<D>__{ciao bello.}
<C>__{guido}

<P>__{(to dante)}
<D>__{that's fair.}
<C>__{dante}

<A>__{guido races after claudia, taking the chinchilla coat from lilli with him. opportunity for escape.}
<C>__{dante}
