<A>__{montage series of shots lenny in his bmw, driving through the la streets. streetlights and neon flare across the windshield in a calligraphy of light. lenny works the cellular, gets messages on his digital pager, weaves in and out of traffic punches the buttons on his radio, changing stations all the time. raw, nervous energy: like a kid who can't stay still. it's a hard hustle in the big food chain.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{look, jerr. i'm nothing if not a man of my word. i will drop the money by tomorrow, next day latest. it's a little crazed right now. yeah, on my mother's eyes, i swear. thanks, buddy.}
<P>__{(hangs up)}
<D>__{prick.}
<P>__{(to the car ahead honking)}
<D>__{what kinda move you call that?! lemmings.}
<A>__{lenny turns up the radio. selected drive by images, as the talk radio provides commentary. lenny's car passing under glowing santa clauses on the light poles. banners proclaiming the coming "millennium la" festivities.}
<D>__{talk radio host ... it's a little after 2 am on december 30th, 1999... the second to last day of the whole darn century, and the phone lines are open. dan from silverlake, you're on the air.}
<A>__{transition to a rougher section of town. buildings roll by endlessly, tagged by gangs in graphic tribal patterns. some are burnt out ruins.}
<C>__{dan from silverlake}
<D>__{uh, hi.}
<C>__{host}
<D>__{so dan, are you looking forward to the new year?}
<A>__{a building is burning out of control. in the foreground, silhouetted, a drunk sleeps soundly on a bus bench.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{not really. i mean what's the point? nothing changes new years day. the economy sucks, gas is over three bucks a gallon, fifth grade kids are shooting each other at recess... the whole thing sucks, right? so what the hell are we celebrating?}
<A>__{a shanty camp of homeless people under a freeway overpass. homes made of cardboard and carpet remnants. their lives in shopping carts.}
<C>__{host}
<D>__{you're a glass is half empty kind of guy, aren't you dan? well i for one happen to think that us making it 2000 years is worth celebrating }
<A>__{lenny cuts him off, punching to another station, and music blasts. something fast... a rap metal hybrid. anger and energy.}
