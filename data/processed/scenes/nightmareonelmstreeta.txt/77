<L>__{exterior police station. night.}
<A>__{music mounts as we move with nancy across the lawns to the police station, creeping to the first lighted window she sees. it's a low, barred basement window, and nancy reacts as soon as she looks through it.}
<L>__{interior rod's cell. night.}
<A>__{nancy's pov down into rod lane's cell. the boy is on his rough cot, twitching in disturbed sleep. and a long shadow is sliding across the wall. a big shape appears in the shadowed corridor outside the boy's cell, and as it walks closer nancy can barely see it's the shambling, grimly scarred man with the filthy red and yellow sweater and strange slouch hat pulled across his brow. the killer from all of their nightmares. and this giant shadow of a man passes through the bars of the cell, like so much evil jello. halfway through he pauses, turning to check over his shoulder. we see the bars clearly penetrating his body, going in his head, passing out his ankles. then he turns back to rod and moves forward, and within another heartbeat is beside the boy.}
