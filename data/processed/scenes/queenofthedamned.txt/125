<A>__{... golden dark hands pull clothes away from lestat's white skin... breasts strain through white linen as they press themselves closer to him... the surface of water, scented with red rose petals. lestat's white skin breaks the surface. lestat is lowered into the bath, his skin alive with the dancing candles reflected in the water... the water laps gently strange sighs of pleasure as girls' hands caress lestat's torso... their hands reach down lower and lower through the water... lestat's eyes remain closed but his mouth opens... now it's akasha kissing him. lestat responds, but his eyes sneak a peek. akasha smiles takes his head in her hands she kisses him, pushes him back he tries to resist he can't, startled by her strength... akasha kisses his neck, his chest, bites... lestat arches in ecstasy... akasha rises up from his breast, blood on her lips, smiles, goes back down and drinks.}
