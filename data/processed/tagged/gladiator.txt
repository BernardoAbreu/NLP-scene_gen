<L>__{exterior forest day}
<A>__{germania. the far reaches of the roman empire. winter 180 a.d. incongruously enough, the first sound we hear is a beautiful tenor voice. singing. a boy's voice. credits as we hear the haunting song float through dense forests. we finally come to a rough, muddy road slashing through the forest. on the road a german peasant father is herding along three sickly looking cows. his two sons are with him. his youngest son sits on one of the cows and sings a soft, plaintive song. they become aware of another sound behind them on the road the creak of wood, the slap of metal on leather. the father immediately leads his cattle and his sons off the road. they stand still, eyes down: the familiar posture of subjugated peoples throughout history. a wagon train rumbles past them. three ornate wagons followed by a mounted cohort of fifty heavily armed}
<B>__{praetorian guards.}
<A>__{the young boy dares to glance up at the passing romans. his eyes burn with hatred.}
<L>__{interior wagon day}
<A>__{mist momentarily obscures a man's face. frozen breath. the man is in his 20's, imperious and handsome. he is swathed in fur, only his face exposed. he is commodus. he glances up.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{do you think he's really dying?}
<A>__{the woman across from him returns his gaze evenly. she is slightly older, beautiful and patrician. a formidable woman. she is lucilla.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{he's been dying for ten years.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{i think he's really dying this time.}
<A>__{a beat. their breath turns instantly to mist.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{he has to be bled every night now.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{how do you know that?}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{i've been so informed.}
<A>__{she arches an eyebrow.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{if he weren't really dying he wouldn't have sent for us.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<P>__{(a smile)}
<D>__{maybe he just misses us.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{and the senators. he wouldn't have summoned them if }
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{peace, commodus. after two weeks on the road your incessant scheming is hurting my head.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{the first thing i shall do is honor him with games worthy of his majesty.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{the first thing i shall do is have a hot bath.}
<A>__{the wagon rumbles to a halt. voices are heard outside. commodus leaps out...}
<L>__{exterior wagon outpost day}
<A>__{three roman soldiers guard an outpost, a watchtower, on the roadside.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{why have we stopped?}
<C>__{praetorian guard member}
<D>__{we're here, sir.}
<C>__{commodus}
<P>__{(to soldier #1)}
<D>__{where is my father? soldier #1 he's at the front, sir.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{is the battle won? soldier #1 don't know, sir. they've been gone for eight days.}
<A>__{commodus tosses off his furs beneath them he wears a beautiful set of lorica segmentata the traditional formed armor of rome. he moves to a horse as:}
<C>__{commodus}
<P>__{(to soldier #1)}
<D>__{my sister wants a bath, take her to the camp.}
<P>__{(to soldier #2)}
<D>__{take me to my father.}
<A>__{he leaps onto the horse and canters back to the praetorian guard unit. soldier #2 climbs on his horse and leads them. commodus rides off with most of the praetorian guard unit. lucilla peeks her head from the wagon. she glances at the remaining soldiers. distinctly unpromising.}

<L>__{exterior hill twilight}
<A>__{the mighty catapults dwarf the humans. soldiers from the elite felix regiment a legion of the roman army haul the monstrous machines up a hill. the commanding general of the felix regiment, maximus, walks between two of the catapults. he is a striking and intense man in his 30's. like all the soldiers who surround him, he is caked with mud and exhausted. he trudges up the hill with his two lieutenants, titus and}
<B>__{quintus.}
<C>__{titus}
<D>__{you would do as well to read the mind of a rhinoceros.}
<C>__{quintus}
<D>__{these barbarians would rather drown in blood than yield an inch. if i didn't hate them so much i would admire them.}
<A>__{they have reached the top of the hill. stunning martial preparations are underway. the catapults join ten others. archers are taking up position. brutal "scorpions" devices for firing multiple crossbow bolts are being loaded. soldiers are also loading the catapults with enormous "greek fire pots" large, round terra cotta pots. maximus and his lieutenants gaze down from the hilltop. below them they can see a german encampment.}
<C>__{titus}
<D>__{they simply will not surrender.}
<A>__{a beat as maximus gazes down at the german position.}
<C>__{maximus}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{a people should know when they are conquered.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{at the first signal release the catapults. we'll use the cavalry to cut off the retreat.}
<C>__{quintus}
<D>__{general, i don't recommend that. our cavalry might be caught in the flames.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{i hope not, because i'm going to be leading them.}
<A>__{a beat as he gazes down at the enemy.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{why don't they know they're already dead?}
<L>__{exterior trees twilight}
<A>__{maximus and titus are on their horses, the cavalry of two hundred felix regiment warriors surrounds them. steam flares from their horses' nostrils. they wait in a thick stand of trees the german position can be seen across a muddy plain. a large wolf "the wolf of rome" waits at maximus' side. maximus nods to an archer. the archer lights the tip of an arrow and sends it flaming into the night sky.}
<L>__{exterior hilltop twilight}
<A>__{quintus waits. the catapults are loaded and waiting. so too the scorpions. so too the 200 archers of the felix regiment. he sees the flaming arrow flying up from below.}
<C>__{quintus}
<D>__{now!}
<A>__{the mighty catapults are released. the greek fire pots arc dramatically through the air. a moment later soldiers release the scorpions and hundreds of bolts streak through the sky. the archers fire a murderous barrage of flaming arrows.}
<L>__{exterior trees twilight}
<A>__{the screaming is almost immediate. maximus and his cavalry watch as the fire pots crash down into the german encampment.}
<L>__{exterior german camp twilight}
<A>__{the fire pots shatter pitch splashes everywhere seconds later the bolts and flaming arrows slice down and ignite the pitch flame explodes it is a hellish, napalm like vision the conflagration illuminating the twilight. the deadly rain of flaming arrows spreads terror through the german camp }
<L>__{exterior trees twilight}
<A>__{maximus watches the german camp.}
<C>__{maximus}
<P>__{(to his men)}
<D>__{hold steady... steady...}
<A>__{he can see the nightmare destruction of the encampment continuing fire pots and scorpion bolts and flaming arrows panic in the german encampment.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{steady...}
<A>__{he sees the germans begin fleeing across the plain. he quickly raises his sword and whispers a prayer, then turns to his men:}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{brothers i salute you! for rome!}
<A>__{he spurs his horse and races out of the trees to the plain...}
<L>__{exterior plain battleground twilight}
<A>__{maximus leads the terrifying and relentless cavalry charge titus at his side the felix regiment screams out fearsome war cries as they gallop across the muddy plain toward the germans fire pots and flaming arrows are crashing down everywhere around them the cavalry slams into the germans at full gallop it is carnage. the felix regiment warriors slash ruthlessly with short swords slicing a path of sheer destruction through the germans but the germans fight with equal brutality and the germans also fight with the desperation of a hopeless last chance they pull and spear roman soldiers off horses whenever they can maximus spins his horse and swings his sword with expert efficiency a spear stabs through the neck of his horse and it immediately collapses forward maximus sails over the horse's head and crashes to the muddy ground he jumps up and is in the midst of the battle the flaming arrows and exploding fire pots create a ferocious inferno everywhere around the battle the flames silhouetting the fighting on the ground, maximus proves his absolute worth as a warrior he hacks and dodges ghastly images of true ancient warfare maximus' eyes burn with a zealous fire as he fights for his life he finds he is momentarily at a terrible disadvantage germans are surrounding him from all sides as he fights he looks for an advantage for his soldiers for anything he is doomed then an almost mystical image maximus' wolf leaps through a wall of flame "the wolf of rome" savages several germans around maximus giving him the help he needed. the wolf and his master fight, side by side.}
<L>__{exterior hilltop twilight}
<A>__{we see an old man's face, staring down at the battle. the face is weather beaten, ailing. the roaring flames from the battlefield below flicker in his sad eyes. marcus aurelius, the emperor of rome, is on a horse. a metal brace extends from the back of his saddle. he is strapped to the brace with thick, leather straps. he watches as the felix regiment below concludes the battle. the cheering of the regiment can be heard as the final, isolated pockets of germans are cut down. behind marcus the sun is setting, painting the world blood red.}
<L>__{exterior battlefield sunset}
<A>__{maximus, bloody and spent, walks through the aftermath of the carnage. the wolf of rome is at his side. dead and dying by the hundreds are scattered everywhere. roman surgeons are attending to the wounded. marcus walks to him, embraces him warmly.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{caesar.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{maximus, you prove your valor again. let us hope for the final time here.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{i don't think there's anyone left to fight.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{there are always people left to fight...}
<A>__{marcus takes maximus' arm and they walk through the masses of bodies. maximus holds marcus' arm firmly, quietly supporting him as they walk.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{but this night, at least, germania is at last defeated... what will you do now, my friend?}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{should caesar permit, i will go home. i've been away too long. i've forgotten my wife's face and i barely know my son.}
<A>__{suddenly, a tethered german prisoner they are passing calls out to them:}
<C>__{german prisoner}
<D>__{this blood means nothing, conqueror!}
<A>__{maximus and marcus stop. a soldier moves quickly to silence the german prisoner.}
<C>__{marcus}
<P>__{(to soldier)}
<D>__{stop...}
<P>__{(to prisoner)}
<D>__{... you speak our language?}
<C>__{german prisoner}
<D>__{you have been in my homeland for twelve years. of course i speak your language. so did my son, who you murdered. so did my daughter, who you raped.}
<C>__{maximus}
<P>__{(to marcus)}
<D>__{come, caesar...}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{no. let him speak...}
<P>__{(to prisoner)}
<D>__{... i am rome, what would you say to me?}
<C>__{german prisoner}
<P>__{(points to sunset)}
<D>__{you are that sun, rome, and your time is over... you can slit a thousand throats here, and you can put a thousand babies to the sword, but it will always be our home.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{now it is rome.}
<C>__{german prisoner}
<D>__{it will never be rome. not as long as one german breathes.}
<A>__{the soldier moves to kill the insolent prisoner.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{no... release him. give him safe passage. let him go to his family.}
<A>__{the soldier leads the german prisoner away. maximus and marcus continue walking in silence for a beat. then:}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{tell me again, maximus, why are we here?}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{for the glory of the empire, sire.}
<C>__{marcus}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{yes. i remember.}
<A>__{they continue walking through the mountains of bodies...}
<L>__{exterior road sunset}
<A>__{maximus and marcus are now walking along a road through the dense forest. slaves follow behind them, leading their horses. both sides of the road are filled with the men of the felix regiment. as maximus and marcus pass, the battered and bloody soldiers drag themselves to their feet, raising their swords, paying silent homage.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{they honor you, caesar.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{i don't think they're standing for me, maximus. they honor you.}
<A>__{just then commodus canters into view with his praetorian guard escort. he watches the army honor maximus with rank envy as he nears. he rides up to maximus and marcus.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{have i missed it?}
<A>__{he leaps from his horse.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{have i missed the battle?}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{you've missed the war. we're done here.}
<A>__{commodus embraces him, awkward.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{father. congratulations. i shall sacrifice a thousand doves to honor your triumph.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{spare the doves and honor maximus, he won the battle.}
<A>__{commodus embraces maximus, even more awkward.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{general, rome salutes you and i embrace you as a brother.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{highness.}
<A>__{they walk, maximus still supporting marcus, as:}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{your spaniards seem invincible. may the gods favor the felix regiment now and always...}
<P>__{(to his father)}
<D>__{here, father, take my arm.}
<C>__{marcus}
<P>__{(ignores this)}
<D>__{where's your sister?}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{she's at the camp. she had no desire to see the gore of the battlefield.}
<C>__{marcus}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{lucilla would eat every corpse here if it brought her one step closer to the throne.}
<A>__{maximus laughs.}
<C>__{maximus}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{caesar, you do the lady injustice.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{it's a foolish old cobra who doesn't recognize his own off spring...}
<P>__{(he suddenly stops, not feeling well)}
<D>__{i think... i should ride now.}
<A>__{maximus waves for marcus' horse. it is brought up. several soldiers carefully help the old man into the saddle. he is then tethered to the brace on his saddle. it is a slow, graceful and embarrassing ordeal for the emperor of rome. when at last he is strapped in, he looks to maximus.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{so much for the glory of rome.}
<A>__{without a word to his son, marcus nods and the horse is slowly lead away. commodus and maximus watch him go.}
<C>__{commodus}
<P>__{(neutral)}
<D>__{he's dying.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{poor old man.}
<C>__{maximus}
<P>__{(terse)}
<D>__{if you'll excuse me, highness.}
<A>__{he turns and stalks away.}
<L>__{exterior tent city night}
<A>__{we see the roman encampment, a sea of tents. hundreds of campfires burn before the tents.}
<L>__{interior hospital tent night}
<A>__{maximus enters a large tent and is met by a spectacle of the dead and dying. roman surgeons are working feverishly to save lives. limbs are amputated, the bloody stumps quickly cauterized with hot irons. leeches and bronze cups are employed for blood letting to balance "humours." anesthesia as we know it is nonexistent. wine amphoras are passed around and orderlies fan narcotic smoke toward the patients. mostly, though, they just hold down the writhing patients. maximus moves through the tent, offering a word of comfort here and there. all the wounded are delighted to see him. he goes to an older soldier, gallus, who has one wooden hand. his other hand is bandaged.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{what, gallus, losing your other hand?}
<C>__{gallus}
<D>__{aye, general, they're going to make a bronze one for it. long fingers this time.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{and the women of your village will crave your touch even more.}
<C>__{gallus}
<D>__{ah, then you know the women of my village.}
<A>__{maximus smiles and moves on. he stops at a young soldier, valerius, whose head has been shaved. a hole has been bored into his skull to relieve the pressure on his brain. the young soldier is dying.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{what's your name, son?}
<C>__{valerius}
<D>__{valerius, general.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{the name suits you.}
<C>__{valerius}
<D>__{why am i dying?}
<A>__{a beat. maximus sits by his cot. he takes valerius' hand.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{you're dying because you love rome, as i do.}
<C>__{valerius}
<D>__{i've never been to rome.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{neither have i. rome for us lives here...}
<P>__{(he touches his heart)}
<D>__{... it's a thing inside us that came from our ancestors and that we give to our children.}
<C>__{valerius}
<D>__{it must be glorious, rome. i've only seen pictures. is it a glorious place?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{yes, it's a glorious place.}
<C>__{valerius}
<D>__{it must be.}
<A>__{he smiles. and he is dead. maximus sits for a moment. he gently closes valerius' eyes. and maximus finds that he is weeping. he is not ashamed of the tears.}
<L>__{interior mess tent night}
<A>__{an immediate swirl of noise. the grand mess tent is crowded with soldiers. they are still filthy with caked on mud and blood. wounds are bandaged and tankards are raised in celebration of the victory. marcus sits in a central position and receives visitors. currently two senators, falco and gaius, are bowing before him.}
<C>__{falco}
<D>__{hail, marcus aurelius.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{stand up, senators. that unfamiliar posture doesn't suit you.}
<C>__{gaius}
<D>__{we live in supplication to your glory.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{all the while conspiring with that fat man in rome. how is the old monster?}
<C>__{gaius}
<D>__{senator gracchus is hale, sire.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{still damning me to the four winds?}
<C>__{gaius}
<D>__{still eager for your triumphant return to rome, caesar.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{i would have silenced him decades ago but i just like him too much.}
<A>__{meanwhile, maximus stands with his lieutenants, titus and quintus. a wound on maximus' arm has been bound.}
<C>__{maximus}
<P>__{(to titus)}
<D>__{if you want to stay on, i support you. so do the men. i will ask the emperor to appoint you in my place.}
<C>__{titus}
<D>__{it won't be the felix regiment without you.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{i will return after a season at home. maybe two.}
<C>__{quintus}
<D>__{that means after three or four more babies.}
<C>__{titus}
<D>__{and you'll be too fat from vibia's cooking to get on your horse by then.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{should the gods so bless me. i would be thankful.}
<A>__{commodus perambulates up to them.}

<P>__{(to maximus)}
<D>__{my old friend, my father tells me you're returning to spain?}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{a pity. i will need men like you in my army...}
<A>__{an awkward glance between the soldiers. this sort of talk is offensively premature.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{there are larger division that might appeal to you. even the praetorian guard. you've never been to rome. imagine arriving as head of the praetorians! they have really splendid uniforms.}
<C>__{maximus}
<P>__{(cold)}
<D>__{i'm going home.}
<A>__{senators gaius and falco join them.}
<C>__{gaius}
<P>__{(to maximus)}
<D>__{... and why not apply for entry to the senate?}
<C>__{falco}
<D>__{a war hero with a handsome face and a strong heart could go far.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{general maximus, may i present senators gaius and falco. beware of this gaius, he'll pour a honeyed potion in your ear and you'll wake up one day and all you'll say is "republic, republic, republic..."}
<A>__{laughter.}
<C>__{falco}
<D>__{have you never considered rome?}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{you've had my ear since we were children. you could be a valuable ally in the senate.}
<C>__{gaius}
<D>__{are you a believer in republicanism?}
<C>__{commodus}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{there i warned you.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{i'm a soldier, not a politician.}
<A>__{meanwhile, a dark eye is studying the men through a hidden slit in the tent wall. the eye is particularly drawn to maximus.}
<C>__{gaius}
<D>__{if your heart lies with the people, i would back you for the senate. i'm sure gracchus would as well.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{not a word about that sodomite bastard.}
<C>__{gaius}
<P>__{(smiles to maximus)}
<D>__{the august senator gracchus has been rather a gadfly on the flesh of the imperial family.}
<C>__{falco}
<D>__{he's a damned provocateur.}
<C>__{gaius}
<D>__{he lives under the antiquated assumption that the senate should represent the people with vigor.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{i won't tolerate it. his incessant criticism exhausts me. the man can speak for five hours without taking a breath.}
<C>__{gaius}
<D>__{he serves rome best when he serves it with honesty.}
<C>__{commodus}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{enough... maximus, i would like to inspect the felix regiment at dawn. please arrange it.}

<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{my men have been fighting for five solid days. they're too busy dying to go on dress parade.}
<A>__{a beat. commodus' eyes flash fire at this public rebuke. he very quickly gets control.}
<C>__{commodus}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{of course, how foolish of me. some other time...}
<A>__{he notes his father being helped out of the tent by several body slaves.}

<D>__{caesar retires early tonight.}
<L>__{interior tent corridor night}
<A>__{marcus is helped out of the mess tent into a tent corridor attached. he sees his daughter lucilla in the corridor, spying in through the slit in the tent wall. he watches her, smiles.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{if only you had been born a man...}
<A>__{she turns to him. he leaves his body slaves and goes to her.}

<D>__{father.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{what a caesar you would have made.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{you're right.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{i think you would have been strong. i wonder if you would have been just?}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{i would have been what you taught me to be.}
<A>__{a beat. they stare at each other. he finally smiles.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{well, pretend to be my loving daughter tonight and walk with me to my chamber.}
<A>__{she smiles and takes his arm. they slowly walk down the tent corridor as:}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{this is a pleasant fiction, isn't it?}
<A>__{they disappear into darkness.}
<L>__{exterior tent city dawn}
<A>__{maximus is slogging through the mud and snow that blankets the rome camp. he stops to observe an unusual sight. commodus is stripped almost naked, his chiseled body covered in a fine sheen of sweat. he and his six centurion body guards are going through their daily ritual. they defy the sub zero temperatures and hack at small trees with swords. it is an eerie, zen like workout. commodus' intense concentration is unnerving. maximus watches for a moment then moves on. he approaches a large network of tents. he enters.}
<L>__{interior marcus' tent day}
<A>__{maximus enters marcus' darkened tent. flickering braziers provide the only light in the enormous imperial tent. heavy beams support the canopy and they creak like the timbers of a ship as the tent sways slightly in the wind. marcus stands before a map of the roman empire.}

<P>__{(bows)}
<D>__{caesar.}
<A>__{marcus holds out a scroll.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{read this.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{i never acquired the art, sir.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{of course. no matter. in this letter i denote my intention to nominate you to stand for the emperorship after my death.}
<A>__{a stunned pause. maximus stares at him.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{my son is not a moral man. you have known this since you were young. he cannot rule.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{caesar, i am honored but }
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{for twenty years i have been spilling blood. for twenty years i have written philosophy and ruminated and conquered. since i became caesar i have only had four years without war. four years of peace in twenty. so perhaps i can be... forgiven.}
<A>__{a long beat.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{while i have been fighting, rome has grown mad and corpulent and diseased. i did this. and now i shall make it right.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{sire, you brought the light of the gods to barbarian darkness. you brought civilization and justice to the farthest }
<C>__{marcus}
<P>__{(fierce)}
<D>__{i have brought the sword nothing more! rome is far away and we shouldn't be here. what matter is it to the gods if we subdue one more tribe of parthians or gauls? what matter is it to rome if a thousand more barbarians bend to our lash?}
<A>__{a beat. marcus sits. he doesn't look at maximus. a pause.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{winter, maximus. it's winter now...}

<A>__{the crowd cheers and maximus immediately turns and starts slashing tiger easily blocks and strikes back the sword play is very fast they block and parry and hack like lightning constantly attacking they are perfectly matched as he fights maximus becomes aware of a strange sound over the roar of the crowd a low rumbling then he feels something a vibration in the ground suddenly traps doors swing open and four enormous platforms rise into view. on each platform is a snarling bengal tiger restrained by a chain. tiger's teams of "cornermen" hold the chains through a pulley system. the cornermen are safely inside cages. the platforms stop at ground level. the four ferocious tigers now mark the four corners of the battleground. tiger takes advantage of maximus' momentary confusion and assaults brutally forcing him back toward one of the tigers the tiger claws for maximus maximus just evades it claws rolls for a new position another tiger snaps at him tiger attacks maximus is on the defensive fighting off tiger and evading the four snarling beasts and then all four tigers are suddenly closer. the teams of cornermen are letting the chains play out, bit by bit, gradually reducing the size of the battle ground. the crowd roars. but the fight is hardly fair. whenever tiger is near one of the tigers the cornermen pull back the tiger slightly when maximus is near a tiger they let it out a bit. maximus and tiger fight swirling action finally, maximus has the edge he circles so that the sun stabs into tiger's eyes then maximus lunges forward under tiger's swinging sword and slams into him they fall a tiger swats at maximus' face he jerks his head back he shoots out a leg and kicks tiger's sword toward one of the tigers it is out of reach maximus leaps up and stands over the winded tiger, sword to his throat. tiger is gasping for breath, crushed. then one of tiger's corners suddenly cheats they completely release a tiger it leaps for maximus maximus barely has time to turn the tiger crashes into him its claws slashing into his back, cutting through his leather armor maximus shoves an armored forearm into the tiger's jaws and stabs with his sword tiger takes this chance to pull himself up one of his corners throws him another sword the crowd boos maximus wrestles with the tiger spinning it around with superhuman effort so it is always between himself and tiger so that tiger can't get at him maximus finally kills the tiger and leaps for tiger he quickly disarms him and tosses him to the ground maximus stands over him ready to administer the coup de grace. all eyes turn to the emperor. commodus slowly stands and steps to the edge of the imperial box. he raises his arm and gives the fatal thumbs down. maximus looks up at him. and then defiantly tosses the sword to the ground, refusing to kill tiger. commodus is stunned. the crowd gasps a collective intake of breath and then an enormous roar building. it cascades around the colosseum. it is a roaring celebration of the unexpected act of mercy. and the delicious act of defiance of the emperor. commodus slowly sits. maximus walks across the arena the people stand and cheer for him. cries of "maximus the merciful" can be heard. it is the birth of a hero.}
