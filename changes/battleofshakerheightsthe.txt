<ACTION_ALT>__{A RABBIT}
<ACTION>__{Darts out of a log, lifts itself on its hind legs and sniffs the air.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{LOBBED GRENADE EXPLODES}
<ACTION>__{VOICES and SHOUTS, closer now, mix with the rumbling WAR SOUNDS in a veritable symphony of violence and confusion. A DEAD AMERICAN GI lays splayed out, careless in death. A pair of SOLDIERS flash among the trees, running hunched over and low, and disappear into the gray blooms of SMOKE. For a moment the forest takes a breath. Nothing but trembling leaves. Then - The RATTLE of a Jeep Coming closer in fits and starts, GRINDING through low gears. A Willys MB appears, CRASHING through the undergrowth. It's driven by Private First Class KELLY ERNSWILER. Eighteen, if that. Not much meat on him. His insignias indicate he's in the 29th Infantry. His face might be attractive, under other conditions. He pauses and pulls a map from the pocket of his M41 standard- issue field jacket.}

<DIAL>__{Where the hell are those Krauts?}
<ACTION>__{To give himself courage, he SINGS Tommy Dorsey's "I'll Be Seeing You [in all the old familiar places]" while maneuvering the Jeep through the bushes and rocks. He drives straight for a fallen LOG, GUNS the engine and tries to go over it. The Jeep's FRONT WHEELS catch on the log. The BACK TIRES spin. Kelly gets out. Takes off his M1 combat helmet and wipes his face. Assesses the situation. He grabs a BRANCH. Jams it under the wheel, trying to lever the Jeep free. When -- The STUTTER of a nearby MACHINE GUN startles him. The branch SNAPS against Kelly's weight. He slips and falls in the mud.}
<CHAR>__{KELLY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Shit.}
<ACTION>__{Determined, he grabs his pack and carbine and sets off on foot through the forest.}
<LOC>__{EXT. CLEARING}
<ACTION>__{Kelly strides purposefully out of the woods. Pauses against a split-rail fence beneath the innocent sun. Across the clearing stands a seemingly abandoned BARN. But not for long, as TWO GERMAN INFANTRYMEN appear around the corner of it. Kelly moves behind a tree to assess the situation. Unaware, the Germans smoke and talk. Kelly's too far away to hear them but he watches their every move. They're relaxed, not as on guard as they should be. Their Karabiners rest slung across their backs.}
<CHAR>__{KELLY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Bingo.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{AGAINST THE TREE}
<ACTION>__{Kelly focuses himself. Then he shoulders his carbine. Pulls out his dog tags and kisses them grimly.}
<CHAR>__{KELLY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{"And so they buried Hector, breaker of horses."}
<ACTION>__{He takes his Smith & Wesson 1917 PISTOL from his pistol belt and steps out into the SUNLIGHT FIELD in plain sight of the guards. Surely he knows they can see him. He must want them to see him. But they don't. Too busy passing nudie wallet photos. Halfway across the open grass, Kelly raises the pistol but does not aim it. Just strides steadily closer, arms spread out, making himself an easy target. Crazy as it seems, Private Kelly Ernswiler is trying to get himself killed.}
<LOC>__{EXT. BARN}
<ACTION>__{Kelly pauses not twenty feet from the Germans, FIRES into the air and waves -- -- when from behind him comes a voice.}

<DIAL>__{Eine maus findet den kase.}
<ACTION>__{Kelly whips around to face a third German, the OFFICER. His pistol points right into the Officer's shocked pink young face. Point blank range. Only - Kelly doesn't fire. He just lowers the pistol. The German smiles.}

<DIAL>__{Kill me Adolf.}
<CHAR>__{GERMAN OFFICER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Mien Prisoner!}

<CHAR>__{GERMAN OFFICER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(sneers)}
<DIAL>__{There are no rules in war.}
<ACTION>__{Suddenly another AMERICAN GI appears behind the German in the shadows. Only Kelly can see him. The GI motions to Kelly "keep talking" while he gets into a better position with his M-1 rifle.}

<CHAR>__{GERMAN OFFICER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I shower in the blood of my victims --}
<ACTION>__{The GI shoots the two infantrymen who fall in exaggerated pain and commence death throes. Quick as a flash, the GI's Colt 1911 PISTOL is at the German Officer's neck, his M-1 in his other hand.}

<DIAL>__{No wonder you smell so bad.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(to Kelly)}
<DIAL>__{You all right?}
<CHAR>__{KELLY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah. My elaborate death scene wasn't going anywhere anyway.}

<DIAL>__{You want me to give you a minute?}

<DIAL>__{Yup. Just got her. Three summers packing out at Shop Rite.}
<ACTION>__{Bart unfolds an entrenching tool from his belt and digs under the back wheels, building up dirt. Then he goes around to the front and puts his shoulder against the hood. Bart rocks the Jeep while Kelly pumps the gas. The Jeep finally pulls free and SPRAYS Bart with mud.}

<DIAL>__{My bad. Thanks though.}
<ACTION>__{Kelly looks over his shoulder and starts backing away.}
<CHAR>__{KELLY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<ACTION>__{The customers are all REENACTORS. Some Yanks, some Germans, a few Scottish and North African irregulars. "Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy" plays on the jukebox. Bart and Kelly sit in a booth together. Bart has an easy, confident manner and expansive gestures. Kelly eats hunched over, like someone might try and steal his food.}
<CHAR>__{BART} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Character building? Those crazy guys from Ann Arbor tied them to a dock.}

<CHAR>__{BART} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{KELLY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{Let me guess. Happy Meals for the wavy gravy wellness center?}
<ACTION>__{Abe grabs two pieces of bread from a loaf. He looks kind. A bit ill-used by life. The phrase "rode hard and put away wet" comes to mind.}
<CHAR>__{ABE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{As usual, your cynicism is refreshing.}
<ACTION>__{He finishes that sandwich and adds it to the pile. Kelly pauses while opening the refrigerator. His back tightens. He slams the door with his foot.}

Some have on hats or clothes. Kelly's mom EVE shows grandmother XIOU-XIOU a few strokes with a paintbrush. Eve wears jeans.

<CHAR>__{KELLY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Plus that, you'd have to have protesters and stuff.}
<CHAR>__{ABE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Folks dressed up like your mom and me. People reenacting fleeing to Canada, burning draft cards. I guess that would ruin the spirit of the thing, now wouldn't it?}

<DIAL>__{He looks just like you.}
<ACTION>__{Kelly nods slowly, taking this in. And it is finally too much. He breaks down and cries. For the fear and the misplaced rage, the fights and the stubbornness. But finally, relief. They walk back down the hall together. Eve reaches out and puts her hand on Kelly's neck.}
