<A>__{frock rolls back down the hall the way margo just came. margo is beside him, downcast. she's not used to defeat.}

<D>__{this isn't a death sentence. greg has promised to teach me fly fishing. i will garden. i will write.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{you are this museum. it won't be the same without you.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{everyone needs a change of scenery. i've been rolling down these halls for forty odd years. that's quite enough.}
<A>__{margo gets in the elevator reluctantly. he smiles and meets her eye.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{i will see you at lunch.}
<A>__{he waves her off merrily. but once the doors close and margo's out of sight, frock's smile fades and his shoulders sag. he ducks his wheelchair quickly into the hall of african mammals.}
