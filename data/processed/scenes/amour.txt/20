<L>__{interior hallway living room day}
<A>__{the front door is unlocked from the outside, and georges enters. he's back from the funeral, dressed for the occasion. he turns on the light. he's wet. clearly, it's been raining. as he closes the door again, his eyes fall on anne. with her back to him, she is sitting on the floor in front of the opened window of the light well, half propped against her wheelchair.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{what ... ?!}
<A>__{shaken, he heads toward her, picks her up and seats her in the wheelchair. outside, in the light well, it is raining.}
<B>__{pause.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(once she's seated in the wheelchair)}
<D>__{why are you back already? what time is it?}
<B>__{pause.}
<A>__{georges has understood immediately. he closes the window noiselessly. then just stands there, at a loss. silence. then}
<C>__{anne }
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{forgive me, i was too slow.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{anne...}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{can you wheel me into the living room?}
<B>__{pause.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{he turns toward her, pushes the wheelchair into the living room between the two armchairs. turns on the light. stops beside the switch. they both look exhausted.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{you're always good at surprises.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{yes. why are you home earlier?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{i didn't come home earlier. i took a taxi. in august, there isn't a lot of traffic.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{that's true. how was the funeral?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{anne...!}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{how was it, go on, tell me!}
<A>__{he thinks an instant, then goes and sits down facing her in an armchair. looks at her. she raises her head and returns his look. he understands that he can't insist right now. long pause. then he begins:}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{it was rather bizarre. the priest was an idiot. then one of pierre's co workers made a speech that was embarrassingly emotional. his old secretary came with a radio cassette player and after the speech she put on "yesterday" by the beatles. you can't imagine. everybody turned round to look at her. apparently, it wasn't planned. his grandchildren were there. of course they giggled as soon as the music began. then the urn was put on a huge stretcher that was obviously designed for a coffin, and out we went into the rain. they placed the urn on a small electric cart that crawled along for what seemed like an eternity to the tiny hole they had dug. a lot of people had to stifle their laughter. it must have been terrible for jeanne. i have...}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(interrupting him)}
<D>__{there's just no point in going on living. i know it can only get worse. why should i inflict it on us? on you and me.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{you're not inflicting anything on me.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{you don't have to lie, georges.}
<B>__{pause.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{imagine you were me. didn't you ever think something like this could happen to one of us?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{of course i did. but imagination and reality have little in common.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{but things are getting better every day. we'll...}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(interrupting him)}
<D>__{georges, i don't want to carry on. you're making such efforts to make everything easier for me. but i don't want to go on. for my own sake. not yours.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{i don't believe you. i know you. you think you're a burden on me. but what if things were the other way around? what would you do then?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{i don't know. i can't be bothered to think about being you. i'm tired. you tire me. everything tires me. i can't talk. i want to go to bed.}
<A>__{he looks at her. finally he gets up and pushes her wheelchair out of frame.}
