<A>__{a chilling sound echoes through the forest the ululating war cries of untold na'vi. the troopers, look around, spooked. they can't tell where the sound is coming from. then they feel it the ground itself shaking. they grip their weapons, bracing themselves as three hundred na'vi horsemen charge through the forest at a full gallop, their hooves pounding the earth. it is an awesome sight. norm spellman rides with the na'vi hunters, carrying an assault rifle. the na'vi charge thunders toward the human line. the hunters raise their bows as the ampsuits raise their gau 90's. on the thermal imagers target cursors track the ghost riders.}

<A>__{the entire line of troopers opens fire. tracers riddle the jungle, blasting foliage into confetti. charging direhorses crash down, flipping over. riders are flung off. the withering fire continues, and the ranks are decimated as riders launch their arrows at a full gallop. a few hit their marks among the troopers. norm fires his ar on full auto. two charging direhorses have a heavy log slung between them like a battering ram. at a full gallop they hit an ampsuit, flipping it onto its back with a blown out canopy. victory is short lived as the two riders are cut down. norm's horse is hit by tracer fire. he is flung off as the creature cartwheels. he hits hard, scrambling for cover as a warrior hurls his spear a moment before his horse is cut down. it slams through an ampsuit's canopy but the merciless fire continues. horses rear and collapse. riders pivot their mounts to flee and the thermal screens show the remaining ghost riders scattering. lyle signals and the line advances, firing sporadically at moving targets. overhead, na'vi hunters stream through the trees, running along the branches. as the troopers advance into bow range, the na'vi open fire and troopers sprout arrows in throat, legs, masks the targets jake taught them, but the firing line aims upward, tracking the thermal targets. tracers rip through the foliage and na'vi fall while others retreat as bark and wood is blasted off the limbs beneath their feet. norm sprints frantically through the woods, shouting into his handset }
