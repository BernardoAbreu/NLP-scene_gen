<D>__{my great great grandmother was princess margaret ke'alohilani, one of the last direct descendants of king kamehameha. she was originally supposed to marry her hanai brother, but she fell in love with her haole banker and estate manager, edward king, whose parents were missionaries. between his land deals and her huge inheritance, all of their descendants for generations have watched the past unfurl millions into our laps through leases and sales. now the rule against perpetuities is forcing us to dissolve the trust, and we're selling the last parcel of undeveloped land.}
