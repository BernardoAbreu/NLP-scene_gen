<L>__{interior laforche home bedroom morning}
<A>__{curtis sits on the edge of his bed staring at the window in their room. he's already dressed for work. he watches as the thick, dark rain hits the window and streaks. he has a curious look on his face. moving, down the hall. moving, past the den. moving, into the kitchen. curtis stops at the entry to the kitchen. samantha, wearing a robe, stands with her back to him. she's cooking something at the stove. curtis notices the back door standing open. hard rain slants down outside. he looks down at the tile floor. wet footprints track inside. they lead to where samantha is standing. she turns to him. she's pale with a vacant look on her face. her hair is soaking wet. curtis looks at her, concerned. she stares back, emotionless. she slowly looks down at the counter next to her. a kitchen knife rests there. curtis looks at the knife. they look at one another again.}
