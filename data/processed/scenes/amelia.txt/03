<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior reception area day}
<A>__{she is younger, dressed conservatively. the calm at the center of a storm. agents, authors, couriers, peddlers come and go. but she has her legs drawn up beneath her, pouring through a small stack of volumes. as if preparing for an exam. superimpose: g.p. putnam's sons publishing co. 1928.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{the waiting made her furious. she undoubtedly felt i was establishing my dominance and importance.}
<A>__{she doesn't look furious at all. thumbing through we by col. charles lindbergh. photos of lindy beside the spirit of st. louis in paris.}
<D>__{george (v.o.) (cont’d) actually, i hadn't given her a thought. oblivious as usual. which, perhaps, was even worse.}
<A>__{now, skyward by adm. richard byrd. photos of the explorer preparing for his flight over the north pole. one of byrd with george himself, displaying considerable gravitas.}
<C>__{amelia }
<D>__{i figured he'd be pompous.}
<A>__{her eye travels over the stack of books. adventurers, explorers, celebrities. on an end table, a framed photo of george with the great lindbergh. a pretty secretary comes to summon her. amelia rises, smooths the wrinkles from her brown suit. they head down the corridor.}
<D>__{amelia (v.o.) (cont’d) i knew, of course, that he wasn't going to choose me. i had no discernible qualifications whatsoever.}
<A>__{they reach the door, already ajar. it says george palmer putnam on a small bronze plate. the secretary gingerly pushes it open... ...revealing george on the phone in crisp shirtsleeves and suspenders. he paces, prowls, trailing the cord behind him, negotiating non stop even as he flips through a pile of messages. off again, stalking the room. dashing, electric, masterful.}
<C>__{amelia }
<D>__{but to be rejected by this... parasite. a man who had given up any life of his own to flutter near the famous.}
<A>__{he glances up, realizing for the first time that she is there. sit, please. but she doesn't.}
<D>__{amelia (v.o.) (cont’d) i didn’t know whether to laugh or throw something at the jerk.}
<A>__{he gestures again, more commandingly. sit. she doesn't move, she doesn't smile. she doesn't take her steady gaze from him. he hangs up the phone. they stare at each other for a frozen beat. he breaks the moment with a charming smile...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{miss earhart?}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{mr. putnam?}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{i asked you to sit.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{was that the thing you did with your hand? sadly, i don't speak dog.}
<A>__{his smile now only a trace. but more genuine.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{ah. well, stand if you like.}
<A>__{amelia sits.}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{i'm told you want to fly the atlantic ocean.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{in the 12 months since lindbergh, 55 people in 18 planes have tried. three planes made it. fourteen people have died.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{i will make it.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{three women died trying. two others escaped with their lives. if you do make it, you'd be the first. which...is the real attraction for both of us, i suspect.}
<A>__{she nods. no smile.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{always nice to know what the real attraction is.}
<A>__{his smile. beginning to enjoy this conversation.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{the plane was bought from adm. byrd by amy guest, a socialite who wanted the record for herself. her family wouldn't tolerate the danger. she has asked for a replacement...}
<A>__{he gestures. perhaps you.}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{...who is american, educated, well spoken, a flyer, preferably physically attractive...}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{why would that matter?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{because she wants the world to pay attention. and pretty girls command more attention.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{was that your advice?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{sure. my role is selling this event to the public. there will be a contract for the girl's story with the new york times. also a book to be published over her name.}
<A>__{understood...?}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{but all the money from these will go to mrs. guest.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{except for the part that goes to you.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{which will be as great as i can manage, i assure you.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{you said she wants a flyer.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{don't get your hopes up. the celebrated wilmer stultz will be the pilot. there'll be a male co pilot and navigator. the woman will be purely a passenger.}
<A>__{he waits for reaction. she keeps her mouth shut.}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{that's good for your chances. because your level of flying experience wouldn't place you anywhere near the group that would be considered for this. if the woman were to do any flying at all.}
<A>__{no punches pulled. not his style.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{why would anyone want a book from a passenger?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{because the hook is that we're making the woman the commander. the pilot will sign a contract saying he is under her direction and control. it's her ship, her flight.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{good for my chances, you said. what are my chan...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{the job's yours.}
<A>__{she blinks. stunned speechless.}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{i chose you the moment you walked through the door.}
<A>__{he smiles his charming smile. several phones are ringing.}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{now assuming my awful manners haven't soured you on the enterprise. may i give you a lift to the station?}
<A>__{amelia rises. is she pissed at being toyed with?}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{you're a busy man, mr. putnam. i can find my way.}
<A>__{the look holds. he shrugs. you probably can.}
