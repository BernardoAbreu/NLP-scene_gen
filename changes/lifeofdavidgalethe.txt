<ACTION>__{A dishevelled WOMAN in a business suit (27) runs down a lonely highway in Texas hill country, moving desperately through the thick morning fog. She's carrying a VHS cassette. The sounds of her breathing and SHOES HITTING the PAVEMENT ECHO into the mist. She runs, and runs. She slows, out-of-strength, looks up and down the highway. Both in front and behind, it leads straight into the mist, a tunnel of fog. She stumbles on, a final effort. She runs. Sees something. Stops cold.}

<ACTION>__{The office is small, cheaply furnished. One wall is filled with neat rows of 8x10's of death row inmates. About 30 percent have red crosses over their faces. Five people wait in tense silence. A SKINNY COLLEGE GUY with a mullet and pinch of Skoal in his mouth looks at a computer screen. A co-ed cuddles a Styrofoam cup of coffee, sobs quietly. A matronly woman sits quietly at a desk holding a phone to one ear. The clock's minute hand changes from :11 to :12. CONSTANCE HARRAWAY (36), bookish, sits beside DAVID GALE (31). He wears a blue Yale sweatshirt. They both stare at nothing. She bites her lip.}

A paunchy Hispanic (20's) with a shaved head sits back against the building, making clicking sounds. A skinny white guy with his shirt off tosses a tennis ball against the building.
