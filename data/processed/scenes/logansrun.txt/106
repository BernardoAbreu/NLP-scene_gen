<P>__{(grimacing)}
<D>__{is that what it is to grow old?}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(still stunned)}
<D>__{it could be...}
<A>__{there are a couple of cats on the man's lap as he turns and faces logan and jessica...when he hears them move closer. the man is stroking the cats calmly...unperturbed by the appearance of logan and jessica.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{how old are you?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{as old as i am i suppose...who knows ?}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{your hair is white.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{it wasn't always. i remember when it wasn't. but it wasn't your color either.}
<P>__{(looking at jessica)}

<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{i've forgotten. it's been so long since i've used it.}
<A>__{logan and jessica exchange a quick glance...feeling they have come upon a nutsy, fruitsy cupcake.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{but all of my cats have names.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{is that what they're called cats?}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{yes, cats, of course. what else could they be? cats. of course each one has his own name too.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{but there are so many of them. do you know each one separately.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{yes indeed, everyone. actually, they all have three.}
<P>__{(reciting)}

<A>__{logan and jessica are silent.}
<C>__{old man}
<P>__{(reciting again)}
<D>__{"but above and beyond there's still one name left over, and that is the name that you never will guess; the name that no human research can discover but the cat himself knows, and will never confess."}

<D>__{for as long as i can remember.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{what kind of place is this?}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{just a place, i suppose...who knows?}

<C>__{logan}
<D>__{how did you get here?}

<P>__{(not knowing what it is)}
<D>__{buried???}
<A>__{logan wheels...as he hears the noise of a door squeaking slightly...as it opens a bit wider:}
<B>__{close on a cat}
<A>__{coming through the opening did he push it?}
<B>__{close on the man}
<C>__{old man}
<P>__{(pleased; reciting)}
<D>__{"gus is the cat at the theatre door. his name, as i ought to have told you before, is really asparagus. that's such a fuss to pronounce, that we usually call him just gus."}
<A>__{wider angle including logan and jessica}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{may i see your hand again?}
<A>__{logan and jessica extend their left hands. the old man takes them, looks from one to another with delight.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{they're beautiful. may i have one too please?}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{no i'm sorry. it's not possible.}
<C>__{old man}
<P>__{(offended)}
<D>__{it isn't fair. i will give you one of my favorite cats...a jellicle cat.}

<A>__{as the man continues to look petulant:}
<C>__{jessica}
<P>__{(simply; sincerely)}
<D>__{that's the truth.}
<A>__{jessica takes off a ring and hands it to the man.}
<C>__{jessica}

<A>__{the man seems pleased.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{what kind of jewel is this?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{you're both full of secrets like macavity.}
<P>__{(looking at the ring)}
<D>__{did you steal this?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{old man}
<P>__{(reciting)}
<D>__{"macavity, macavity, there's no one like macavity, there never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity."}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{what's beyond this place do you know?}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{no, no, no}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{did your mother or father ever mention another place?}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{never, never, ever. nothing.}
<A>__{after a pause:}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{may we stay here for a while? we'd like to rest.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{of course you can stay. this belongs to the people.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{what belongs to the people?}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{all this. all of it.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{what people?}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{i don't know...but it does.}
<A>__{the man stands...and starts walking toward a door to an adjoining room.}

<A>__{the man smiles and leaves.}
<B>__{logan and jessica}
<A>__{logan clears two chairs of cats and they sit down. jessica picks up a book and starts leafing through it. logan is deep in thought. jessica looks up from the book.}

<A>__{silence...until:}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{that sweet madman how could he come to exist?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{he had a mother and father and he knew them.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{one in a million, i suppose}
<C>__{logan and jessica}
<P>__{(together; smiling)}
<D>__{...who knows?}

<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{we're going on, aren't we?}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{there's nothing to go on to, jessica.}
<A>__{logan continues to shake his head through jessica's following line:}

<C>__{logan}
<D>__{you want there to be one...that doesn't...}
<C>__{jessica}
<P>__{(interrupting; urgent tone)}
<D>__{there has to be! i know it exists! it has to!!}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{no, there doesn't. not really just so many want it to exist...so many who don't want to die...want it so much that a place called sanctuary becomes "real". but it doesn't exist. it never existed. just the hope.}
<C>__{jessica}
<P>__{(becoming hysterical)}
<D>__{you're wrong!! it has to be!! it just has to be!!}
<A>__{as logan takes her in his arms...comforting her: full angle including the man the man returns with a portrait in hand.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{oh, my don't cry.}
<A>__{the man proudly shows them the portrait....which is a portrait of himself in his twenties. he sort of brushes the hair...which is rich auburn.}
<C>__{old man}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{there are larger pictures of other people over there. i don't know who they are. perhaps they're family.}
<A>__{she man leads logan across the chamber to a far corner. close on jessica remaining near the podium. she is dejected. logan's argument that there is no sanctuary has sunk in and taken hold.}
