Nikolai is de-frosting Soyka's left hand with the hair dryer, concentrating on his ring finger which has a gold ring on it. The parts of Soyka's shirt and jacket which are visible are crusted with frozen blood. Nikolai is wearing rubber gloves. As he dries, Nikolai takes a sip of coffee. Ozim is watching this scene with horror. Kirill has his arms folded, mightily impressed. Finally the hand is thawed enough for Nikolai to remove the gold ring. He studies an inscription and then offers it to Ozim. Ozim shakes his head as if the thing were a contagion. Nikolai shrugs and pockets it. He then turns the hair dryer back on and blows some hot air onto the crisply bloody chest of Soyka. He tugs at the frozen lapel of the jacket and blows air into the inside pocket. Within a few moments he is able to remove Soyka's glistening, thawing wallet which is caked in frozen blood. He opens it (we glimpse a photo of a wife and children) and blows hot air onto the money inside. He tugs a wad of frozen bank notes from the wallet, all stuck together by drops of frozen blood. He offers this money to Ozim as well but Ozim shakes his head vigorously. Kirill hoots with laughter. Ozim is now staring at Nikolai as if he were a devil from hell.

<DIAL>__{A summer's day. Anna, Helen and Uncle Stepan are preparing to eat Sunday lunch. Stepan is carving. The conversation is jovial as Anna and Helen bring dishes of food to the table. Then we hear a baby crying. Anna goes to a small crib and lifts a six-month-old Christine out. She hands her to Helen who hugs her. Over this happy scene we hear Tatiana in V.O., a repeat of the first words we heard her say.}
<CHAR>__{TATIANA } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{My name is Tatiana. My father died in the mines in my village, so he was already buried when he died... Anna takes Christine back and takes her to the window to peer outside, staring across the park.}

<DIAL>__{Nikolai is sitting at a window table, alone, sipping vodka, staring back across the park. He peers out at ordinary life going on in the streets outside. Tatiana's V.O. continues...}
<CHAR>__{TATIANA } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{We were all buried there. Beneath the soil of Russia. That is why I left to find a better life. Nikolai finishes his drink.}
