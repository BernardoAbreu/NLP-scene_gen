<A>__{ali la pointe's glance is sullen, heavy, motionless. he moves his head slowly in such a way so that his glance also moves in a semicircle. white beach, fine sand, transparent sea, bodies stretched out in the sun, golden skin of girls; girls in bikinis, sensual, smiling, young men with narrow hips, with muscles well cared for, cheerful youth, naturally happy, enviable. the children are building sand castles near the water's edge; the beach is shaped like a half moon with rocky reefs at both ends ... a september sunday, warm and calm. ali is leaning on the wall. he is wearing a white wool cloak. only his eyes are visible ... the eyes of a hungry tiger perched above a path, on the lookout for innocent prey. eyes that now gleam, cruel eyes, tension dilating the pupils ... then again the calm, a gloomy calm, a gratifying tension. the place is right, and the victims couldn't be better ones. ali moves, leaves the wall, crosses the street to a large city sanitation truck, one of those metallic trucks with no visible openings. a young algerian is at the steering wheel, a street cleaner. he is leaning his thin face on the wheel. his hands are dirty, by now unwashable from years of work. ali has climbed into the cab. the truck is in motion and leaves.}
