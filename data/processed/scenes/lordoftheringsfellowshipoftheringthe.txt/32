<L>__{interior bag end living room day}
<A>__{bilbo leads gandalf into bag end...cozy and cluttered with souvenirs of bilbo's travels. gandalf has to stoop to avoid hitting his head on the low ceiling. bilbo hangs up gandalf's hat on a peg and trots off down the hall.}
<C>__{bilbo}
<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{tea? or maybe something stronger... i've a few bottles of the old winyard left,}
<A>__{..a very good year, almost as old as}
<D>__{i am. it was laid down by my father. what say we open one, eh?}
<A>__{bilbo disappears into the kitchen as gandalf looks around..enjoying the familiarity of bag end...he turns, knocking his head on the light and then walking into the wooden beam. he groans.}
<D>__{bilbo (o.s.) (cont'd) i was expecting you some time last week. not that it matters, you come and go as you please, always have done, always will. bilbo (o.s.) (cont'd) you've caught me a bit unprepared, i'm afraid...we've only got cold chicken, bit of pickle, some cheese here...ooh, no, that might be a little risky...}
<A>__{gandalf stops in front of a framed map, charred in one corner...it is thorin's map of the lonely mountain, gandalf smiles to himself.}
<C>__{bilbo }
<D>__{er, we've got raspberry jam and apple tart...got some custard somewhere. not much for afters, i'm afraid. oh no...we're alright...i've just found some sponge cake. nice little snack. hope it's enough.}
<P>__{(comes into view)}
<D>__{i could do you some eggs if you like?}
<A>__{bilbo jumps, a half eaten pork pie in his hand, as gandalf mysteriously appears behind him.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{just tea, thank you.}
<C>__{bilbo}
<D>__{oh..right. you don't mind if...?}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{no, not at all. go ahead. a sudden loud knock on the front door.}
<A>__{mrs. sackville baggins (o.s.) bilbo baggins, you open this door..i know you're in there.}
<C>__{bilbo}
<D>__{i'm not home.}
<A>__{gandalf watches, amused as bilbo tries to hide.}
<C>__{bilbo }
<D>__{i've got to get away from these confounded relatives, hanging on the bell all day, never giving me a moment's peace. i want to see mountains again...mountains, gandalf... and then find somewhere quiet where i can finish my book...oh, tea!}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{so, you mean to go through with your plan, then?}
<C>__{bilbo}
<D>__{yes, yes...it's all inhand. all the arrangements are made.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{frodo suspects something.}
<C>__{bilbo}
<D>__{'course he does, he's a baggins...not some block headed bracegirdle from hardbottle!}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{you will tell him, won't you?}
<C>__{bilbo}
<D>__{yes, yes.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{he's very fond of you.}
<C>__{bilbo}
<D>__{i know. he'd probably come with me if i asked him. i think, in his heart, frodo's still in love with the shire, the woods and the fields... little rivers. bilbo stands gazing out of the kitchen window.}
<C>__{bilbo }
<D>__{i am old, gandalf... bilbo looks at gandalf sadly...}
<C>__{bilbo }
<D>__{i know i don't look it, but i'm beginning to feel it in my heart.}
