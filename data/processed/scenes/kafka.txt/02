<T>__{cut:}
<A>__{a row of typewriters day clacketing incessantly under slightly more agile and refined fingers. beyond these, another row of desks. and beyond that another, the office workers in their neat suits tapping away. and beyond that another, at which one worker scribbles furiously at his figures, the next rolls a new sheet into his typewriter, the next answers his clanging telephone, the next rifles through the pages of a massive record book, the next sits erect in his chair playing his machine like a piano, and the last, by the window, dusty light streaming across him, contemplatively taps the end of a pencil onto his desk. this is kafka. a rather tall young man with a kind, sensitive face. sensitive perhaps because his eyes, ears, and nose seem slightly bigger and more inquiring than most, and his gaze one of almost unrelenting intensity. he's looking off at something now. a desk, not very far from his own. but empty. the chair pushed squarely under it. the typewriter covered. kafka is wondering why when his concentration is interrupted.}

<A>__{kafka turns to see burgel, a creep.}
<C>__{burgel}
<D>__{the keeper of the files is still waiting for your final summation of the erlanger claim.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{i gave it to him yesterday.}
<C>__{burgel}
<P>__{(doesn't understand)}
<D>__{you didn't give it to me .}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{no, i left it in his office.}
<C>__{burgel}
<D>__{did you see him?}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{i've never seen him. i don't believe there is a keeper of the files.}
<C>__{burgel}
<D>__{he's usually in the storage room sorting things out. he can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{he has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?}
<C>__{burgel}
<D>__{who's to say he ever will? he's a timid old man and quite careful not to tread on anyone's toes in fact, i'm the only one he trusts and he wouldn't even look at a document if it didn't first come through me.}
<A>__{burgel just won't go away. kafka tries to get on with his work.}
<C>__{burgel}
<D>__{in an organization as efficient as ours, if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all.}
<C>__{kafka}
<P>__{(tiring of this)}
<D>__{burgel, i thought it would be easier, as long as i was passing }
<C>__{burgel}
<D>__{but i'm the messenger. an error like this damages my credibility.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{your credibility yes, it's well known.}

<P>__{(flushed)}
<D>__{when i deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{i will commit that to memory.}
<A>__{they stare at each other with mutual antagonism.}
<C>__{burgel}
<D>__{your position in this firm is not unassailable.}

<A>__{has one more look over at the empty desk before returning to his work.}
