<A>__{schindler wanders around a large empty apartment. there's lots of light, glass bricks, modern lines, windows looking out on a park.}
<L>__{interior the apartment night}
<A>__{the same place full of furniture and people. lots of ss in uniform. wine. girls. schindler, drinking with oberfuhrer scherner, keeps glancing across the room to a particularly good looking polish girl with another guy in uniform.}
<C>__{scherner}
<D>__{i'd never ask you for money, you know that. i don't even like talking about it money, favors i find it very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable }
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{no, look. it's the others. they're the ones causing these delays.}
<C>__{scherner}
<D>__{what others?}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{whoever. they're the ones. they'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me.}
<A>__{scherner thinks he understands what schindler's saying. just in case he doesn't }
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{i should send it to you, though, don't you think? you can forward it on? i'd be grateful.}
<A>__{scherner nods. yes, they understand each other.}
<C>__{scherner}
<D>__{that'd be fine.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{done. let's not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time.}
