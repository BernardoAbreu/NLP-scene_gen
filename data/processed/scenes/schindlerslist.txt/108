<A>__{the others have gone. it's just goeth and schindler now. goeth pours glasses of cognac.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{something wonderful's happened, do you know what it is? without planning it, we've reached that happy point in our careers where duty and financial opportunity meet.}
<A>__{schindler nods pensively, perhaps in agreement, perhaps at some other thought. there's a silence, broken finally by }
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{i go to work the other day, there's nobody there. nobody tells me about this, i have to find out, i have to go in, everybody's gone }
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{they're not gone, they're here.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{they're mine!}
<A>__{his voice echoes into silence. an acquiescent shrug from goeth finally. and a nod; schindler's right.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{every day that goes by, i'm losing money. every worker that is shot, costs me money i have to get somebody else, i have to train them }

<D>__{we're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter }

<P>__{(cutting him off)}
<D>__{it's bad business.}
<C>__{goeth}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do? you're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example. but that's good business.}
<A>__{schindler pours himself another shot from the bottle, nurses it. he's in a foul mood. they study each other, trying to determine perhaps who's more powerful. eventually }
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{scherner told me something else about you.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{yeah, what's that?}

<A>__{goeth tries to put the situation in perspective:}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{you want to stay where you are. you got things going on the side, things are good, you don't want anybody telling you what to do i can understand all that.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{what you want is your own sub camp.}
<A>__{schindler admits it by not disagreeing. goeth thinks about it, nods to himself again, then frowns.}
<C>__{goeth}
<D>__{do you have any idea what's involved? the paperwork alone? forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy. then the engineers show up. they stand around and they argue about drainage i'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, i've been through it, i know.}
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{well, you've been through it. you know. you could make things easier for me.}
<A>__{goeth mulls it over, his shrug saying "maybe, maybe not." a silence before }
<C>__{schindler}
<D>__{i'd be grateful.}
