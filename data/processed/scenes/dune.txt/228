<L>__{181. through 181a. (deleted) 182. interior training room sietch tabr day}
<A>__{large room with a low ceiling. a drummer playing makes a low echoing musical hit. a big block of stone is moved across coarse sand back and forth fast. a rhythm is started powerful. paul enters, pauses and looks to jessica he stands in front of over 100 fremen men. jessica sits behind him alongside stilgar. a large rock obelisk has been placed near paul for this demonstration.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{the weirding way has long been a bene gesserit secret. with my mother's help, my father isolated an element of the weirding way and externalised it.}
<A>__{ }
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{because of the harkonnen treachery, my father's armies were never able to fully develop this new form. this is what i will teach you. you will be the fiercest and most feared fighters in the universe. our way of battle is built on rhythm. you understand rhythm like this but you do not yet understand the rhythm of the higher sounds, sounds that heal and build... sounds that destroy. motion is the base. you understand the motion... but you do not yet understand the motion that heals and builds... motions that destroy... orato!}
<P>__{(he moves forward)}
<D>__{this obelisk is of your hardest stone. kick it...}
<P>__{(he does the rock doesn't move)}
<D>__{hit it...}
<P>__{(he does the rock doesn't move)}
<D>__{yell at it...}
<C>__{orato}
<D>__{break!}
<A>__{the fremen laugh the rock doesn't move. a fremen with a lasgun tries to cut it. paul motions him back, slightly.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{move back!}
<A>__{paul also moves back. he switches on his weirding module. he opens his mouth and makes a small sound, which the module amplifies.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{chuksa!}
<A>__{the sound shatters the obelisk to pieces. the one hundred fremen yell with surprise and awe.}
<D>__{100 fremen achiii!}
<A>__{ }
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{this is part of the weirding way that we will teach you. some thoughts have a certain sound... that being the equivalent to a form. through sound and motion you will be able to paralyze nerves, shatter bones, set fires, suffocate an enemy or burst his organs.... we will kill until no harkonnen breathes arrakeen air. 100 fremen muad'dib!}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(inner voice)}
<D>__{to avenge my father, i will turn you into killing machines.}
<A>__{stilgar turns to jessica.}
<C>__{stilgar}
<D>__{sayyadina. our reverend mother tells me she is too old... she has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest. she asks that you pass within.}
<C>__{jessica}
<P>__{(inner voice)}
<D>__{they want me to take the water of life... the truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these fremen.}
<P>__{(out loud)}
<D>__{i will try to pass within.}
<C>__{stilgar}
<D>__{death may be the result.... are you sure?}
<C>__{jessica}
<P>__{(inner voice)}
<D>__{i must do this for paul, but what of my unborn child?}
