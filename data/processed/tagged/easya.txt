<C>__{olive}
<D>__{let the record show that i, olive penderghast, being of sound mind, ample breast size and the occasional corny knock knock joke, do enter this video blog into evidence in the case against me. because i'm being judged by a jury of my peers, i will attempt to insert `like' and `totally' into my confession as much as possible. so here it goes... i confess i'm, in no small part, to blame for the vociferous gossip that has turned my varsity letter scarlet, but for anyone hoping that the sizzling details of my sordid past will provide you with a reason to lock the door and make love to a dollop of your sister's moisturizing lotion you'll be gravely disappointed.}
<P>__{(beat.)}
<D>__{look, i just need to set the record straight and what better way to do that, than to broadcast it on the internet. so, here it is part one: the shudder inducing and cliched, however totally false account of how i lost my virginity to a guy at a community college in a neighboring town.}

<D>__{fuck off! george is not a `sexy' name. george is like what you name your teddy bear, not the name you wanna scream out during an orgasm.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{that's bullshit. there are lots of sexy georges.}
<C>__{rhiannon}
<D>__{name three.}
<A>__{olive starts to say something, but rhiannon interrupts her.}
<C>__{rhiannon }
<D>__{besides clooney. too easy.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{shouldn't that alone be enough?}
<C>__{rhiannon}
<D>__{fine. that's one. number two?}

<D>__{okay. george... ummmm... reeves!}
<C>__{rhiannon}
<D>__{who's that?}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{superman. from way back. he was hot.}
<C>__{rhiannon}
<D>__{no way. teddy bear.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{bullshit. ben affleck played him in that movie!}
<C>__{rhiannon}
<D>__{so what? charlize theron played that butt fucking ugly lesbo serial killer. besides he's from another century.}
<C>__{rhiannon }
<D>__{we're speaking present day. i mean, jesus, mortimer was probably a sexy name in some era.}

<D>__{george stephanopolous.}

<P>__{(thinking hard)}

<C>__{rhiannon}
<D>__{bush? yeah. he's one hot mutherfucker. just face it. there's no such thing as a sexy george.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{well, mine is. so, i think we should just put this conversation to bed.}

<A>__{mr. and mrs. abernathy (50's) sit on their couch, smiling at the television, in their horrifically rustic home. mr. abernathy bares a striking resemblance to ukelele player, tiny tim. (although the man we're looking at has an even more frightening smile.) mrs. abernathy has hair to her ankles and dresses like a mormon.}
<C>__{olive }
<D>__{i've always felt sort of sorry for rhiannon, but not enough to do what she was asking me to do.}

<A>__{olive is on the other end of the phone conversation. we intercut : between the two sides.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{rhi, i can't. i told you i have plans.}
<C>__{rhiannon}
<D>__{you're lying. you're a lying bitch and i hate you so much right now.}
<C>__{olive}
<P>__{(lying)}
<D>__{i'm not lying. i promise i'm not. i really would love to go camping with your family this weekend. i had fun with your family last year.}
<L>__{exterior woods last year night}
<A>__{olive, uncomfortable, and rhiannon, bored, sit around a campfire with the abernathys. the couple stare at the fire with the same creepy smile plastered on their faces. there is an excruciatingly long and painful silence.}
<C>__{mr. abernathy}
<D>__{would you like a marshmallow, olive oil?}
<A>__{mrs. abernathy squeaks out a meek titter that is annoyingly high pitched.}
<C>__{mrs. abernathy}
<D>__{olive oil. that's funny. very, very funny.}
<C>__{olive}
<P>__{(politely)}
<D>__{no thank you, mr. abernathy.}
<C>__{mr. abernathy}
<D>__{you can call me mortimer, olive branch.}
<A>__{mrs. abernathy titters again. rhiannon rolls her eyes. there is another awkwardly long silence, while the abernathys grin away at their fire.}

<A>__{rhiannon is getting increasingly angrier at her friend.}
<C>__{rhiannon}
<P>__{(into the phone)}
<D>__{why don't you just say it? you don't like my parents. you think they're hopelessly pathetic and devoid of souls and wish that you could live with normal people who didn't meet at a star trek convention!!}
<A>__{she quickly catches her faux pas and stops talking.}
<C>__{olive}
<P>__{(sympathetic to her friend)}
<D>__{rhi, i like your parents. they're sweet. but i can't go camping this weekend.}
<C>__{rhiannon}
<D>__{quick. hurry and make up a lie.}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{i have a date.}

<D>__{with who?}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{you don't know him.}
<C>__{rhiannon}
<D>__{and neither do you, you selfish bitch!}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{i'm serious. he goes to the community college with my brother in denton.}
<C>__{rhiannon}
<D>__{what's his name then?}
<C>__{olive}
<P>__{(waxing cute)}
<D>__{who? my brother?}

<A>__{into the webcam }
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{i'm not proud of this. less about the lie and more about the unoriginality of it. okay, have you guys ever watched `the brady bunch'? of course you haven't. you're busy watching fake people pretend to be real on mtv. that's why i knew i could get away with it. see, there was this episode where jan the awkward middle child made up a boyfriend to assuage the ridicule of her snatchy sister who had just stolen the heart of the boy that jan loved. the name of her imaginary boyfriend was }

<C>__{rhiannon}
<D>__{george? what kind of a fucking name is george?}
<C>__{olive}
<D>__{he's pretty hot and he asked me out this weekend, so i said yes.}
<A>__{although still skeptical, she seems a tad more mollified.}
<C>__{rhiannon}
<D>__{if you're choosing him over helping me cope with two days in the wilderness with these people who even i'm not convinced aren't serial killers, he had better be the one. you had better fucking marry him, have fucking babies with him and then take him for fucking everything he's worth.}

<D>__{olive, life is full of choices. i made a bad one. but then, so did you. we both acted unwisely, but i don't see any other alternative than to live with the guilt. my guilt stems from my indiscretion, yours for lying. we've made our choices. now, we have to ride them out.}

<D>__{with all due respect, mrs. griffin, you're a fucking cunt.}

<C>__{olive}
<D>__{looking back, that's the thing i regret the most. that's the thing that sent me to the church, er, churches. and that's the thing that made me realize how profoundly i'd fucked up.}
<C>__{olive }
<D>__{and that's something i will have to live with for the rest of my life. with my words, even though they were true, i ended a marriage. no kid should have to be burdened with that.}
<A>__{she contemplates this.}

<D>__{it's not your fault.}

<P>__{(in disbelief)}

<C>__{olive}
<A>__{why are you telling me this?}
<C>__{rosemary}
<A>__{because i endured a similar lynching because of a certain dalliance.}
<C>__{olive}
<A>__{i promise that it was no worse than marianne bryant's attack on me.}

<C>__{olive}
<A>__{that's disgusting! he's disgusting!}
<C>__{rosemary}
<A>__{he wasn't back then. he was actually pretty handsome. all i'm saying is that maybe the reason that bryant girl is going after you is because her mother told her about me.}
<C>__{olive}
<A>__{so, the sins of the mother are revisited on the daughter.}
<C>__{rosemary}
<A>__{there's something else you should know. this is hard to say but don bryant is your father. marianne is your sister. olive turns white.}
<C>__{rosemary }
