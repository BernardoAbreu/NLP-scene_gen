<A>__{a company built miner's camp. cement huts with steel doors and corrugated roofs. no shrubbery, only dust, cement, and the roughest looking bunch of men assembled on earth.}

<D>__{dear morrie. to answer your question: yes sports are played here, but only in the loosest sense of the words "sport" and "play". the rules are different for everything, in games as well as in the rest of our lives. the managers, the foremen, the company people. they live apart from the miners. they have families. proper gardens. sunday dinners. the miners the crud, as we are called don't. this is a society of men, many of whom have pasts better left behind. future does not apply. it is a society only in the loosest sense of the word. the laws of survival are simple you either do or you don't.}
<A>__{pk comes down a side street. a half a dozen men at cards, hard faced desperadoes, see him pass, eyeing him closely. pk averts his eyes. from behind his back comes the sound of lips puckering loudly, indecently. pk swallows hard. the sound of a charge turns him to the six men bolting from their card game after him, whooping with lascivious intent. pk takes off. the chase takes pk and his pursuers flying through the streets of the camp, past one identical cement hut after another. people watch, disinterested. no one raises a hand to help. pk comes racing around the corner to three of the men blocking the street in front of him. he whirls. the others catch up behind, yelling and hooting. the two lines advance. pk gets ready. when the first man is close enough he hits him hard, breaking his jaw. he swings at another, catching him flush in the face. but then the rest are upon him. even though pk fights like hell, he is overwhelmed. the blows come from everywhere, beating him to the ground. his arms and legs are firmly grabbed by four men. he is banged hard face down onto a concrete table. the fifth man pulls down his pants and the sixth begins to undo his own fly. all the men scream obsceni ties, anticipating the rape. pk struggles like hell to no avail. as he is about to be violated, a roaring giant of a man tears into the pack like a bear shredding dogs. he scatters the men, knocking some unconscious, sending the rest to flight. he stands over pk, a looming block of granite with a wild black beard and coal black eyes. his intent only becomes clear as to whether he is claiming a prize or helping a friend when he offers pk his hand, lifting pk effortlessly. he examines pk's bruised face with some concern and then smiles.}

<D>__{you know, rasputin, i had them right where i wanted them. another minute they were done for.}
<A>__{rasputin claps pk on the back and addresses him in russian, to which pk responds with a smile. the two men walk off together.}
