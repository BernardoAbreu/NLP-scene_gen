<A>__{the presidents hold on desperately as reagan white knuckles it through civilian traffic. they're looking all around, trying to see where utah went.}

<D>__{where are they, man? i don't see 'em. we lose 'em?}
<A>__{not exactly... through the windshield we see an airborne utah hurtling from a ralph's entrance. the sedan lands on the street, tearing chunks out of the asphalt with the undercarriage. an instant later it hammers into the side of the t bird. the two cars spin out of control. utah cuts the wheel, slamming into them again. side by side demolition derby. wham!! utah hits them again. the presidents lose control, jumping a curb, losing the right front tire in the process. utah's car starts to swap ends. hit the center island broadside. the sedan flips onto its back in an explosion of glass. screech of steel on concrete as it comes to rest. hanging upside down, pappas is mightily pissed off.}

<A>__{they can see the t bird still moving. it slews drunkenly as the driver maintains speed on flapping rubber. johnny shimmies out of the wreckage, sliding on his back in broken glass. pappas is packed in, upside down, wriggling to get out through the side window. a tight fit.}
