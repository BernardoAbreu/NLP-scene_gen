<L>__{ext hotel rooftop night}
<A>__{welles emerges from a stairway on the roof of his hotel. he marches to the edge of the roof and leans against a railing, gasping for air. everywhere below him the shimmering lights of manhattan twinkle and flash; cabs and neon and noise. the night sky above him is filled with stars. he looks away from the city and up to the stars they captivate him fully. he stares and stares at the impossible chaos of beautiful lights. a long moment as welles gazes at the stars. the city below and the noise seem to disappear and welles stands, safe and at peace under the silent dome of stars. the stars are reflected in his huge, dark eyes magically, the stars in his eyes give way to the vague shapes of men sitting around a table. welles looks at the men.}
