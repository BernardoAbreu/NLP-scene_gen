<L>__{interior laboratory conference room day}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{... on myself.}
<A>__{the team sits around the conference table. their jaws drop and they stare at him with wide eyes.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{are you nuts?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{was jonas salk nuts?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yeah. pretty sure he was.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{and remember, for every jonas salk, there are a bunch of guys who aren't famous cuz they died.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{if we're that unsure, how can we morally justify testing it on someone else?}
<C>__{janice}
<D>__{isn't it a little soon to be moving into phase three anyway?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{she's right. we haven't even finished collating the phase two research.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{we'll have plenty of time to collate and cross reference later. monkey data doesn't matter anyway. the only real data is human data.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{you don't even know if any of the protocols will work on humans.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{how are we gonna find out? besides, we've succeeded with a gorilla and their dna is 98% the same as humans. and the 2% is not that significant.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{sebastian ... humans can talk, build houses and cook in microwave ovens. gorilla's live in trees. that's a helluva 2% if you ask me.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{we're all concerned. i know that. but if we're gonna move forward ever, this is something we have to do.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{why you? why not one of us?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{the risks. i couldn't ask...}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{what if we volunteer?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{what if you're too valuable to lose?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i'm project leader. it's my formula and my call. the best way to express your concern is to make damn sure you do your best work. i will want about four weeks to...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{to put your affairs in order?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{to run some more reversions and tissue tests and then we'll attempt the phase shift. i will stay shifted for three days of testing and then we'll perform a quantum regression.}
