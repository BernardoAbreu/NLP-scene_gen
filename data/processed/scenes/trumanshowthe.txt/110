<L>__{interior control room. night.}
<A>__{christof and the others watch the monitors spellbound as truman looks directly into one camera lens after another. roman is the first to crack.}
<C>__{roman}
<P>__{(entreating christof)}
<D>__{get somebody in there!}
<C>__{christof}
<P>__{(quiet but firm)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{simeon}
<P>__{(siding with the executive, showing his true colors)}
<D>__{she's in trouble! we've got to help her!}
<A>__{christof, never taking his eyes from the monitor, leans into the microphone.}
<L>__{interior truman's house kitchen. night.}
<A>__{we see an extreme close up of meryl's ear. unheard by truman, from her inner car, we hear a familiar voice.}
<C>__{christof }
<D>__{he's bluffing. call his bluff.}
<C>__{meryl}
<P>__{(in reply to the voice in her}
<D>__{head, half strangled due to the}
<P>__{pressure of the knife)}
<D>__{do something...}
<A>__{upon hearing her remark, truman's eyes widen. sensing that she too is addressing a third person, he jerks her head around to read her face.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(wild eyed)}
<D>__{who are you talking to?!}
<C>__{meryl}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{you're the one talking to the walls!}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{no. you said, "do something." who were you talking to? i swear i will kill you, if you don't tell me.}
<A>__{meryl takes the chance to spin out of his grasp and dashes to the bedroom but before she can barricade the door, truman forces his way inside. they both tumble onto the waterbed causing it to rock back and forth. gripping meryl's hair, truman throws aside the bed covers.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(distraught, referring to the bed)}
<D>__{how could you buy this damn thing when you know he drowned in front of me?!}
<A>__{truman raises the kitchen knife but instead of stabbing meryl begins to slash viciously at the waterbed, opening a large gash.}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{you have any idea what it's like to drown?}
<A>__{truman drops the knife and forces meryl's head into the gaping hole in the bed, submerging her head in the tepid water. she thrashes her arms wildly trying to free herself. truman reluctantly jerks her head back out of the water.}
<C>__{meryl}
<P>__{(gasping for air)}
<D>__{truman, stop it!}
<P>__{(to the ceiling)}
<D>__{don't let him do it!}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(to a light fixture, threatening)}
<D>__{i will kill her!}
<A>__{he dunks her head into the water a second time, holding her head down longer this time. she continues to struggle. suddenly, the front door chimes. startled, truman lets meryl up for air.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(sneering at meryl)}
<D>__{right on time. cops must be telepathic.}
<A>__{meryl spots the kitchen knife within her reach but truman beats her to it. grabbing the knife by the blade, he slices his hand.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(wincing in pain)}
<D>__{damn!}
<A>__{at knifepoint, truman marches meryl down the hallway to the front door. the doorbell chimes a second and third time, more insistently.}
<C>__{truman}
<P>__{(shouting through the closed door)}
<D>__{stay where you are or i will kill her!}
<C>__{marlon }
<D>__{truman? it's me, marlon.}
<A>__{truman flinches. he was so convinced it would be the police. he takes a step back against the hallway wall. before he can decide what to do, marlon has opened the unlocked front door to be confronted with the sight of truman holding the knife to meryl's throat, blood streaming from his own wound. marlon locks eyes on truman. sizing up the situation, he slowly but decisively removes the knife from truman's hand. meryl wrenches herself free from truman's now limp grasp, and collapses into marlon's arms, sobbing.}
<C>__{meryl}
<P>__{(distraught, dropping character, forgetting herself)}
<D>__{they were going to let him kill me!}
