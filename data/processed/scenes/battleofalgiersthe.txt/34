<L>__{34 avenue du 8 novembre. outside. day. 1:10 p.m.}
<A>__{a large garage with workshop and filling station. in front are some automobiles and a military truck. a scooter with two algerian boys passes by, rumbling noisily along the road. then at full speed, it makes a sharp turn, retraces its steps and turns again. the boys seem to be showing off for fun. meanwhile, the employees of the garage are leaving their work since it is lunchtime. the attendant at the gasoline pumps is left alone. the scooter stops in front of the high test gasoline pump. the attendant is a european, an elderly man, who approaches them holding in one hand some bread he has just unwrapped. he detaches the pump handle of high test, and asks how many gallons. one of the algerians points a revolver at the attendant, and tells him to pour out the gasoline on the ground all around. the other, meanwhile, goes to the other two gasoline pumps, detaches the handles, and fastens them in an open position in order to empty them of gasoline. he uses two pieces of iron that he has brought with him to clamp the handles open. he stretches the pump hoses as far as they can go toward the garage and the parked cars. the gasoline flows all over the large square. the two youths are again on the scooter; they tell the european to move away. they have soaked a rag in gasoline and they light it. the gasoline continues to flow from the two open pumps. the european is by now far away, the scooter is already moving away, and at the same time, the boys hurl the lit rag into the square. it immediately bursts into flames.}
