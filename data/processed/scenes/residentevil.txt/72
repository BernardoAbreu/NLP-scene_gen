<A>__{chris' group spills out of the dangling metal, with cables from the torn ceiling...tzzzzzt...sparking around them. the troopers drop out of hell, into...paradise. an enormous hot house, a lush, indoor jungle of plants, ivies, grasses. it's like a rain forest, complete with a thick, damp mist that makes it difficult to see. we might be on another planet. none of the foliage seems indigenous to earth. there are leaves the size of bed sheets, flowers , the size of armchairs. and at the center of it all, is the mother of the deadly vines... ...plant 42, a monstrous schefflera, twenty times normal size. most of its limbs reach upward, where they have opened cracks in the ceiling and walls, to stretch on into the facility above. there are also dozens of shorter, beefier "arms", each of which act independently, like tentacles on an octopus... and each has a large, drooling pod at its tip.}
