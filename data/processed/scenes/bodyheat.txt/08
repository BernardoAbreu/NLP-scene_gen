<L>__{exterior the band shell night}
<A>__{the miranda beach high school orchestra is playing to a full, sweating house; the audience is a sea of orange programs fluttering away as fans. people come and go frequently. the atmosphere is as innocent and informal as the music the band is playing now. racine leans against the back rail, smoking, his eyes playing over the scene with no expectations. then, down near the center aisle, a woman rises. as the band plays on, this extraordinary, beautiful woman, in a simple white dress, moves down the aisle. she moves wonderfully. the dress clings to her body in the heat. racine watches, mesmerized, as she walks directly toward him. she passes within a few inches of him, her eyes lowered. racine's body sways a moment as she goes by, as though buffeted by some force. but they do not touch. she goes out onto the beachfront walkway.}
