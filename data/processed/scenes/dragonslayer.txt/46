<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{mountain top}
<A>__{galen and valerian peer out from behind a boulder and watch ulrich hobble perilously close to the edge of the cliff. the old man spreads wide his arms and tilts his head back.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{nimbus! tempestas! fulmen!}
<A>__{from over the horizon roiling inky black clouds churn down upon them. thunder booms and echoes. a bitter wind whips their clothing. as the storm gathers fury, the dragon reappears, circling in the distance. finally it homes in on the mountain crag and dives at ulrich. the conjurer makes a gesture and strokes of lightning explode against the beast's scaly flanks. it emits a high thin scream and rockets past. galen & valerian valerian crawls away and comes back with a hefty chunk of granite.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{here. do as he said. smash it.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{not if it means killing him.}
<B>__{ulrich}
<A>__{he resolutely waits as the dragon banks against the clouds and starts another pass. again, the sorcerer summons lightning bolts. but the dragon keeps coming; this time a talon splits the old man's cape. galen & valerian valerian wrestles the amulet away from galen. it falls to the ground.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{you heard what he said.}
<A>__{she lifts the chunk of stone. galen grabs for it.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{no! you can't!}
<B>__{the last attack}
<A>__{vermithrax spirals up into the storm, then drops earthward. ulrich watches as the beast comes straight at him. he folds his arms and bows his head. leathery wings humming, the creature levels out, swoops up past the crag and lifts the master magician away in its huge hind claw.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{galen!}
<A>__{galen and valerian are horrified to see the dragon circling upward with the sorcerer writhing in agony in its grip. as the monstrous thing flies high over them, they can hear ulrich's faint screams.}
<B>__{death}
<A>__{now galen understands. he seizes the granite block from valerian and raises it with both hands over his head. he takes a final look at the amulet, glowing at his feet, then brings the rock down with all his might. there is a blinding flash as it shatters into a million fragments. far above there is another blinding flash as ulrich's earthly body explodes against the belly of the beast. the darkened sky lights up as huge gouts of flame spew forth from the dragon's gut. wings fluttering uselessly, this reptilian torch plummets to the ground.}
<B>__{lake}
<A>__{below, a stock pond nestled in the foothill pastures. trailing a wake of flame, vermithrax plunges like a comet into the water. there is a stupendous splash and eruption of steam. galen & valerian they stare down from their lofty perch, watching as further explosions boil the water from the pond.}
<B>__{eclipse}
<A>__{behind a tattered wrack of cloud, the moon slowly uncovers a pale sun.}
