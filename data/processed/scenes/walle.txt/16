<L>__{exterior avenue of trash day}
<A>__{eve wanders through the pillars of cubed trash. scans random areas. wall e spies from the shadows. too frightened to approach. she moves on. he follows.}
<L>__{exterior tire dump day}
<A>__{eve probes a mound of tires. wall e hiding nearby. he flinches at the sight of}
<B>__{his cockroach}
<A>__{innocently approaching eve from behind. she spins around. blasts the insect. wall e is gut punched. the cockroach climbs out of the smoking crater. unscathed. still curious. eve finds the insect intriguing. lowers her arm. the end separates into individual hovering sections...}
<B>__{...a hand.}
<A>__{she lets the insect crawl up her arm. wiggles into her workings. it tickles.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{[giggles]}
<A>__{wall e relaxes. chuckles privately. eve sonically picks up wall e's location. locks onto him. arm converts to laser cannon. fires rapidly. quick glimpses of wall e dodging the blasts. trash piles are systematically obliterated around him. wall e now exposed. nowhere to hide. boxes himself up. shakes uncontrollably. eve holds her fire.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(electronic hums)}
<D>__{[identify yourself.]}
<A>__{she slowly approaches wall e's box. keeps her gun trained on him.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(electronic hums)}
<D>__{[repeat. identify yourself.]}
<A>__{wall e peeks out from his box. doesn't understand a thing she says. doesn't care. can't believe she's real. the cockroach climbs down her gun arm. jumps onto his master. eve scans wall e. a red light appears on her chest. buzzes "negative". he's not what she's looking for. she retracts her gun arm. hovers off. wall e watches her go. lovestruck.}
<D>__{wall e [sigh.]}
