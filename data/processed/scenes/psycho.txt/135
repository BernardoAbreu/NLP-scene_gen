<A>__{the silhouette of norman. he is still. over shot, very dimly, comes the sound of sam's voice, calling again for arbogast. norman turns slowly until, in silhouette, we see his profile, his chin lowered furtively as he looks over his shoulder in the direction of the house. there is silence for a moment, and then again the sound of sam pounding at the door.}

<L>__{interior hardware store (night)}
<A>__{the store is in darkness, only the glow from the back room spilling in.}
<B>__{l.s.}
<A>__{with camera placed with its back to the street door, we can see the distant tiny figure of lila seated and waiting in the back room beyond. there is a sound of a car pulling up. the tiny figure jumps up and runs all the way from the back room down the aisle of hardware and comes into a big head. we see lila's desperate anxious look.}
<B>__{medium shot}
<A>__{from her viewpoint we see sam alighting from his truck and coming toward the door of the store. he enters. he and lila exchange quiet glances.}

<D>__{without calling me?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{in a hurry.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. don't you think he'd have called if he had anything...}

<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{yes. i think he would have.}
<A>__{lila goes quiet. sam starts toward the back room, pauses at the doorway, turns. lila has remained by the door, looking out at the street. she feels his pause, turns, and for a moment they share at each other across the darkened room.}
