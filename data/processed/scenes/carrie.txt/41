<L>__{38a insertinteriorwaiting room day carrie and miss finch interior principal's office day}
<A>__{henry morton, the principal, a decent but somewhat plodding man in his mid forties, is tapping out his pipe as he talks to collins.}
<C>__{morton}
<D>__{isn't she a bit old for her...}
<A>__{well, he can't quite say it.}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{her first period?}
<C>__{morton}
<D>__{ah, yes.}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{morty, until a half hour ago, i don't think she knew there was such a thing.}
<A>__{he hesitates a moment noticing carrie's bloody handprint on collins' gym shorts.}
<C>__{morton}
<D>__{it's hard to believe in this day and age a girl in high school wouldn't know... something... the facts.}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{well, knowing that mother of hers...}
<C>__{morton}
<P>__{(cutting her off)}
<D>__{miss collins, if you'd been with us longer, you'd understand we cannot interfere with people's beliefs. as for the girls}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{carrie's always been their scapegoat. so they...}
<C>__{morton}
<D>__{you'll have to do something.}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{i will. but i understood how those girls felt. the whole thing just made me want to take the girl and shake her.}
<C>__{morton}
<D>__{ummm.}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{it's just her period, for god's sake.}
<C>__{morton}
<P>__{(cutting in; uncomfortable)}
<D>__{we'll send her home.}
<P>__{(to intercom)}
<D>__{miss finch, send in cassie wright.}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{it's carrie white.}
<C>__{morton}
<P>__{(fiddling with paper clips on his desk)}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{the door is opened. carrie stands in the doorway.}
<C>__{morton}
<D>__{come in, cassie.}
<A>__{collins starts to correct him, but:}
<C>__{morton}
<D>__{close the door. no, wait.}
<P>__{(up)}
<D>__{miss finch, bring in a dismissal slip.}
<P>__{(to carrie)}
<D>__{i think you might take the rest of the day and go home and, uh, well... take care of yourself, cassie.}
<C>__{carrie}
<P>__{(hardly a murmur)}
<D>__{carrie.}
<C>__{morton}
<D>__{we're all sorry about this incident.}
<A>__{miss finch, elderly, spinsterish, goggles in with the yellow dismissal slip, brings it to morton who initials it.}
<C>__{morton}
<P>__{(to finch, as she goes)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<P>__{(to carrie)}
<D>__{would you like to go to the infirmary?...}
<A>__{carrie is shaking her head.}
<C>__{morton}
<D>__{...lie down for a while...}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{i think carrie can go home.}
<C>__{morton}
<D>__{would you like a ride?}
<A>__{again, carrie is shaking her head.}
<C>__{morton}
<D>__{we could call you a cab.}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{i'm sure she can walk home. and carrie, you're excused from gym for a week. take study hall instead.}
<A>__{morton picks up the dismissal slip, hands it to carrie.}
<C>__{morton}
<D>__{we are sorry about this, cassie.}
<C>__{carrie}
<P>__{(sudden fury)}
<D>__{that's not my name!}
<A>__{two things happen simultaneously; morton recoils slightly and the ashtray quakes a little and then tumbles from the desk. then carrie goes out. morton comes around the desk, stoops to pick up the ashtray, stares at it curiously for a moment, then looks at collins.}
<C>__{collins}
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{that reminds me. a light blew out while i was trying to calm her down.}
<C>__{morton}
<D>__{i will send a janitor to fix it.}
<A>__{okay, that's reality. he puts the ashtray back on the desk decisively, dismissing any "peculiar" thought he may have had.}
