<L>__{interior stephanie's living room continuous}
<A>__{jack and stephanie are gone. from a distant bedroom comes more laughter.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{looks like our friends are hitting it off.}
<A>__{while maya goes to turn down the stereo, miles sits on the couch. maya's shirt rides up as she crouches, giving miles a glimpse of the small of her back. she takes a seat opposite miles on the couch. they look at each other without speaking. just what is the vibe here?}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{it's kind of weird sitting here with you in stephanie's house. all those times you came into the restaurant. it's like you're a real person now. almost.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{yeah, i know. it's kind of weird. out of contexterior}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{yeah, weird. but great.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{yeah. definitely.}
<A>__{an awkward silence, broken by maya.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{so what's your novel about?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{well, it's a little difficult to summarize. it begins as a first person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{what's the title?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{"the day after yesterday."}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{oh. you mean... today?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{um... yeah but it's more...}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{so is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{mrnmm, yeah... but not really. it shifts around a lot. like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. and some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves or devolves into a kind of a robbe grillet mystery you know, with no real resolution.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{wow. anyway, i think it's amazing you're getting it published. really. i know how hard it is. just to write it even.}
<C>__{miles}
<P>__{(squeezing it out)}
<D>__{yeah. thanks.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{like me, i have this stupid paper due on friday, and as usual i'm freaked out about it. just like in high school. it never changes.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{a paper?}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{yeah. i'm working on a masters in horticulture. chipping away at it.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{horticulture? wow. i didn't know there was a college here.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{i commute to san luis obispo twice a week.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{so... you want to work for a winery or something someday?}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{well...}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. it's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{oh yeah. who cares? i'm the queen of typos.}
<P>__{(sipping the wine)}
<D>__{wow, this is really starting to open up. what do you think?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{my palate's kind of shot, but from what i can tell, i'd dub it pretty damn good.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{can i ask you a personal question?}
<C>__{miles}
<P>__{(bracing himself)}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{why are you so into pinot? it's like a thing with you.}
<A>__{miles laughs at first, then smiles wistfully at the question. he searches for the answer in his glass and begins slowly.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i don't know. it's a hard grape to grow. as you know. it's thin skinned, temperamental, ripens early. it's not a survivor like cabernet that can grow anywhere and thrive even when neglected. pinot needs constant care and attention and in fact can only grow in specific little tucked away corners of the world. and only the most patient and nurturing growers can do it really, can tap into pinot's most fragile, delicate qualities. only when someone has taken the time to truly understand its potential can pinot be coaxed into its fullest expression. and when that happens, its flavors are the most haunting and brilliant and subtle and thrilling and ancient on the planet.}
<A>__{maya has found this answer revealing and moving.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i mean, cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. by comparison. how about you?}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{what about me?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i don't know. why are you into wine?}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{i suppose i got really into wine originally through my ex husband. he had a big, kind of show off cellar. but then i found out that i have a really sharp palate, and the more i drank, the more i liked what it made me think about.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{yeah? like what?}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{like what a fraud he was.}
<A>__{miles laughs.}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{no, but i do like to think about the life of wine, how it's a living thing. i like to think about what was going on the year the grapes were growing, how the sun was shining that summer or if it rained... what the weather was like. i think about all those people who tended and picked the grapes, and if it's an old wine, how many of them must be dead by now. i love how wine continues to evolve, how every time i open a bottle it's going to taste different than if i had opened it on any other day. because a bottle of wine is actually alive it's constantly evolving and gaining complexity. that is, until it peaks like your '61 and begins its steady, inevitable decline. and it tastes so fucking good.}
<A>__{now it is miles's turn to be swept away. maya's face tells us the moment is right, but miles remains frozen. he needs another sign, and maya is bold enough to offer it: reaches out and places one hand atop his.}
<C>__{miles}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{bathroom over there?}
<C>__{maya}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{miles gets up and walks out. maya sighs and gets and american spirit out of her purse.}
