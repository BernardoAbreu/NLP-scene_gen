<L>__{exterior shutter's on the beach morning}
<A>__{the sun shines over the ocean and the hotel.}
<L>__{interior charlie's hotel room}
<A>__{the crew is gathered. lyle, monitoring digital surveillance on his laptop, takes off his headphones.}
<C>__{lyle}
<D>__{well we scared him alright. he's flying the coop. his security guard called brink's armored car service to confirm a 5 p.m. pick up at his house, then jetclub to confirm a md11 cargo plane departing from the imperial terminal at lax at 8 p.m.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{confirmed? how'd we miss the first calls?}
<C>__{lyle}
<D>__{they must have been cellular. the cargo plane is being chartered to mexico city.}
<C>__{handsome rob}
<D>__{only place with worse smog and traffic than l.a.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{once the charter's in the air, he could change the flight path to anywhere. and good bye gold.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{not so fast. this is good news for us.}
<C>__{handsome rob}
<D>__{good news?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{sometimes when you're up to your ass in alligators you forget that you started off trying to drain the swamp.}
<C>__{handsome rob}
<D>__{meaning what the fuck?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{we've been trying to get to the gold in the safe. now the safe is coming to us. we'll boost it in transit.}
<A>__{he might as well have said they'll steal the holy grail before sunrise.}
<C>__{handsome rob}
<D>__{charlie. he could take a dozen different routes to the airport and we have no idea which one. we can't take out an armored truck during rush hour.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{we're already set to do it. napster: how would you like to create the biggest traffic jam in the history of los angeles?}
<C>__{lyle}
<D>__{keep talking.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you gridlock every route except the one we choose. force the truck to go exactly where we want it to go.}
<C>__{handsome rob}
<D>__{but where do we want it? we can't shoot it out with armed guards in a brink's. we'd lose. and even if we pulled it off, the cops would be all over us, chasing us all the way to union station. we're outmanned and outgunned.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{but not outsmarted.}
<A>__{charlie hums with focused energy. there's a term for it in horse racing. when a thoroughbred is at peak condition, and twitching with eagerness to run, he is "on the muscle." that describes charlie right now.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{we'll do it like the italian job. we'll make thirty million in gold drop out of sight.}
<A>__{they're interrupted by charlie's cell phone ringing. this throws them all off.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{who else has this number? half ear no one but us.}
<A>__{it's still ringing. charlie decides to answer it.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{hello?}
