<L>__{exterior sierra bonita apartment back alley day}
<A>__{betty gets rita out of the cab and pays the driver, who then drives away. the girls go through a rear gate and enter the complex walking along a curving concrete walk. this leads them to an intersection where a registry is printed on a rough hewn wooden plaque. they scan the list.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{selwyn ... number 12.}
<A>__{they both look around the various doors near them. betty spots a sign which says, behind an arrow, bungalows #10 through #20.}
<C>__{betty }
<D>__{it's this way.}
<A>__{they set off down another sidewalk toward bungalow #12. as they near it and actually can see it just ahead they pass a chainlink service gate to the alley. standing in the alley is a man in a dark suit wearing sunglasses. both girls dive for the bushes. the man in the black suit turns reacting to the noise and motion. both girls are trying to catch their breath and stay as still and quiet as possible.}
<C>__{betty }
<P>__{(panting whisper)}
<D>__{now, you've got me scared.}
<A>__{peering through the bushes they see the man still looking in their direction. suddenly he turns and smiles at something to his left. he hurries off, but soon returns carrying two heavy suitcases, followed by an older woman in a yellow dress. both betty and rita crawl further forward. they see the limo and realize that the man they were afraid of is an ordinary limousine driver just going about his work. the girls stand up, relieved and a little embarrassed.}
<C>__{betty }
<D>__{see, i told you there was nothing to be afraid of!}
<A>__{they go up to bungalow #12 and stand for a moment facing the front door.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{oh no ... don't.}
<A>__{betty doesn't listen to rita. she knocks strongly on the door. they stand waiting. there's no answer so betty knocks again harder. they wait.}
<C>__{rita }
<D>__{no one's ...}
<A>__{suddenly the door opens. an attractive middle aged woman stands before them.}
<D>__{middle aged woman yes?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{diane? middle aged woman number 17.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{but it said #12. middle aged woman i switched apartments with her. she's in #17. just walk down that way. it's just to the right.}
<A>__{the woman seems to be looking now at rita.}
<P>__{middle aged woman (cont'd)}
<D>__{it's kind of hidden by the foliage.}
<A>__{betty and rita start to leave.}
<P>__{middle aged woman (cont'd)}
<D>__{she hasn't been around for a few days ...}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{well ... we'll leave her a note. middle aged woman}
<P>__{(starting toward them)}
<D>__{i will go with you. she's still got some of my stuff.}
<A>__{the phone rings from inside her bungalow.}
<P>__{middle aged woman (cont'd) (turning back)}
<D>__{oh ... go ahead. i've got to get that.}
<A>__{the woman hurries back inside and closes the door. betty and rita quickly move up the walkway toward bungalow #17.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i guess you're not diane.}
<A>__{rita, still fighting her fear doesn't answer. they reach bungalow #17. it's set back beneath tall bushes and an old eucalyptus tree. the front door is in deep shadow. without even looking at rita betty knocks quickly. there's no answer. she knocks again.}
<C>__{betty }
<D>__{still not home i guess.}
<A>__{the girls drift off to the side of the bungalow. betty tries to see in the windows. she tries a window and to her surprise it opens.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{i don't think...}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(looking around for anyone watching)}
<D>__{c'mon help me in. i will open the front door.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{betty jumps up and catches her knees on the siding, her head through the open window.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{push!!!}
<A>__{rita reluctantly pushes and betty is in. as she closes the window ...}
<C>__{betty }
<D>__{meet you at the door.}
<A>__{rita walks around to the front door and gets there just as betty opens it. betty has her hand over her mouth and nose.}
<C>__{betty }
<D>__{i don't know if you want to come in here or not. there's some kind of horrible smell like... something...}
<A>__{rita is compelled to go in and as the door clicks shut she reacts to the smell.}
