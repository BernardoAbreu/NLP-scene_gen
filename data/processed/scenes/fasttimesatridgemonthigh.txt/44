<L>__{interior wherehouse records mall day}
<A>__{we see a group of buzz cut young toughs, walking in formation, hunched over, sneering and wearing sleeveless u.s. army fatigue jackets. none of these damaged looking kids is over the age of fourteen. they pass to reveal this legend on their backs:}
<B>__{lincoln surf nazis.}
<A>__{angle on mike damone and mark ratner, who are standing by the upcoming concert list posted on the door to wherehouse records. damone sees the surf nazis pass, turns to mark ratner, who is still wearing his cinema four jacket.}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{the business is changing, rat. i will tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to aerosmith.}
<C>__{the rat}
<D>__{i hear they all dress like that at lincoln now.}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{there used to be three or four of those guys. now we see 'em every time we come to the mall.}
<A>__{damone is approached by a couple of young ticket customers.}
<D>__{customer #1 got any blue oyster cult tickets?}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{no cult. i ate twenty four pairs of blue oyster cult tickets last time around. i was this close to working at 7 11. no cult.}
<A>__{suddenly we see all ticket business stop. damone and his customers see someone menacingly coming directly for them. the small crowd parts as charles jefferson, football duffel bag in hand, walks up. with him is a thick, tough, miniature version of himself. this is little charles. they both stop in front of damone.}
<C>__{jefferson}
<P>__{(after long look)}
<D>__{when is earth, wind and fire coming?}
<C>__{damone}
<P>__{(respectfully)}
<D>__{i'm really not sure. i haven't heard anything yet, but i will let you know the second there is the slightest news, sir.}
<C>__{jefferson}
<D>__{i'm taking my little brother.}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{excellent. so that will be two tickets... all right. fine, sir.}
<A>__{jefferson and l.c. push past the customers.}
<D>__{customer #2 wow. he really lives here. i thought he just flew in for the football games.}
<C>__{damone}
<P>__{(gaining composure)}
<D>__{shit, he's my man. he knows where to come for tickets.}
<A>__{damone turns to the rat.}
<C>__{damone }
<D>__{well, rat. are you ready for the moment of truth?}
<A>__{the rat adjusts his jacket, and nods.}
<C>__{the rat}
<D>__{she is immune to my charms.}
<A>__{they walk together towards swenson's, as the rat drapes his aqua blue cinema four jacket around his shoulders, like a french film director. damone walks a few steps, then stops rat.}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{hey, rat.}
<C>__{the rat}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{ace the jacket.}
<A>__{the rat considers the suggestion, gets rid of the jacket. they continue towards swenson's.}
