<L>__{interior hotel rosa's bathroom day}
<A>__{catherine cleans the bathroom of excessive blood. paul sits on the other side of the privacy screen reflecting, in a glum fog, listening. she wrings out a washcloth frequently as she speaks. the excessive blood and water falling into a bucket.}

<D>__{i'd have finished by now, but the police wouldn't let me touch anything. they didn't believe it was suicide.}

<A>__{she rinses the blood from her hands and arms.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{they were all spies! asking if she was sad, if she was happy, if you fought, how long you'd been married, why you didn't have any children. pigs!}
<A>__{disgusted and exhausted, she sits on the edge of the tub. we switch to paul's side of the privacy screen. we see he is deeply disturbed by this situation.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{they got familiar right away! they said, "your boss is a bit unstable." "do you know that he was a boxer?" so?}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{"it didn't work out, so he became an actor." "bongo player, revolutionary in south america, journalist in japan."}
<A>__{she begins to clean blood from the straight razor paul's wife used to kill herself with.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{one day, he lands in tahiti, hangs around, learns french." "then he comes to paris. there... he meets a woman with money, marries her and... "since then what has your boss done?" "nothing."}
<A>__{paul pulls the curtains aside from the window. he looks out. he spies a black couple, one a sax player, in an adjacent building. she is attempting oral sex on him.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{i say, "can i clean up now?" "no! don't touch anything!" "do you really think she killed herself?" he pushed me into a corner and tried to paw me...}

<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{yes, she had cuts there...}
<A>__{he tilts her head back forcefully.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{... and on the neck, too...}
<A>__{he pulls her out of the way and turns off the water. he pulls the shower curtain closed. he storms out of the bathroom, leaving catherine there. when he is gone, she opens the curtain and turns the water back on out of spite.}
