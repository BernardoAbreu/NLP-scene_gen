<L>__{int prison corridor night (1965)}
<A>__{andy trudges down the corridor with norton's laundry, the pie box under his arm.}
<L>__{int library day (1965)}
<A>__{tilt up from pie to find red munching away as he helps andy sort books on the shelves.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{got his fingers in a lot of pies, from what i hear.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{what you hear isn't half of it. he's got scams you haven't dreamed of. kickbacks on his kickbacks. there's a river of dirty money flowing through this place.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{money like that can be a problem. sooner or later you gotta explain where it came from.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{that's where i come in. i channel it, funnel it, filter it...stocks, securities, tax free municipals... i send that money out into the big world. and when it comes back...}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{it's clean as a virgin's whistle?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{cleaner. by the time norton retires, i will have made him a millionaire.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{jesus. they ever catch on, he's gonna wind up wearing a number himself.}
<C>__{andy}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i thought you had more faith in me than that.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{i'm sure you're good, but all that paper leaves a trail. anybody gets too curious fbi, irs, whatever that trail's gonna lead to somebody.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{sure it will. but not to me, and certainly not to the warden.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{who then?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{peter stevens.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{the silent, silent partner. he's the guilty one, your honor. the man with the bank accounts. that's where the filtering process starts. they trace it back, all they're gonna find is him.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{yeah, okay, but who the hell is he?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{a phantom. an apparition. second cousin to harvey the rabbit.}
<P>__{(off red's look)}
<D>__{i conjured him out of thin air. he doesn't exist...except on paper.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{you can't just make a person up.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{sure you can, if you know how the system works, and where the cracks are. it's amazing what you can accomplish by mail. mr. stevens has a birth certificate, social security card, driver's license. they ever track those accounts, they'll wind up chasing a figment of my imagination.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{jesus. did i say you were good? you're rembrandt.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{it's funny. on the outside, i was an honest man. straight as an arrow. i had to come to prison to be a crook.}
