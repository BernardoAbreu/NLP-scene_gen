<L>__{exterior shed day}
<A>__{we hear a, tap, tap, tap. the door is half open. the padlock is hanging on its chain. max opens the door.}
<L>__{interior storage room}
<A>__{startled, frightened, hasari presses himself against the wall, as does manooj. hasari is wearing a wet dhoti, caught in the middle of straightening the wheel rim of the old rickshaw.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{close the door!}
<A>__{max is very surprised but, needless to say, pleased. he looks at the rickshaw, looks at hasari.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{close the door. the godfather has more eyes than a pineapple.}
<A>__{max quickly closes the door. the half light is broken by thin beams of light that dance with dust. hasari studies max a moment, then moves to put the first wheel on. instinctively, manooj moves to his side, takes hold of the rickshaw so hasari can slip the wheel on. hasari nods and goes for the other wheel. manooj moves around to the other side, hefts the carcass. hasari slips on the second wheel. hasari looks at max. max brings his hands together and starts to go.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{i was saying to manooj that if a man bows down too many times, there will come a day when he will no longer be able to stand upright.}
<A>__{the two men look at each other... and then hasari gets on with his work.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i promised manooj and shambu i'd take them to the movies. is it all right?}
<C>__{hasari}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{if a man makes a promise...}
<A>__{max brins his hands together and starts for the door. hasari picks up one of the worn seat boards.}
