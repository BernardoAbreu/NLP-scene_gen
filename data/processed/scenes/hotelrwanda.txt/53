<A>__{paul's at the wheel, driving. a thick mist. barely a car on the road. shadows dart past faint house lights. the windscreen clouds. paul switches on his wipers. a toyota truck, loaded with militia, appears from the mist, speeds past. paul switches the preset buttons on the radio as he drives. he can only find fevered drum based music.}
