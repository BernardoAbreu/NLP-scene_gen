<L>__{exterior oak forest day}
<A>__{war tents have been pitched beneath the majestic trees. near the banner of the dragon a doe grazes. arthur is older, in battle scarred plate armor, pacing and angry. he is watched by his wounded and bruised knights kay, uryens, lot, leondegrance, caradoc, and some new young faces among the ranks. no one talks. the harsh clank of its battle trappings announces the arrival of a horse. all eyes watch it walk into the camp. a knight is slouched in the saddle. arthur runs to meet the horse, followed by squires and some of the knights. he eases the rider to the ground, unlaces his helmet. it is sir ector, and his hauberk is badly dented. tears burn in arthur's eyes.}

<D>__{we fought and won battles, and now one man defeats all my knights? i will go.}
<A>__{he pushes past the knights and goes to his horse. kay steps in front of him.}
<C>__{sir kay}
<D>__{a king must not engage in single contest. i will go again.}
<A>__{arthur rises into the saddle and takes a jousting spear from the rack.}
