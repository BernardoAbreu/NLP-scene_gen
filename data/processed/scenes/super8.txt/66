<A>__{in the cherry picker bucket, rooney works the controls. he begins lifting; a wide shot shows him rising to the bare utility pole stepdown transformer. when rooney finally gets to the top, with gloves hands, he inspects the transformer. after a moment, though, he stops. hears something else, past the sound of electricity. he looks over toward the salvage yard. except it's mostly hidden by the trees. from here, rooney can only see the tops of the junk piles. a small metallic crash. then another. rooney cranes his neck to get a view. another metallic crash, this time glass breaking, too. then, in the distance, at the middle of the salvage yard, something flies into the air, falling and landing with a clang thunk. rooney strains his eyes to see what the hell was that? a tin can? a piece of a fender? hard to tell from here. then, thrown into the air: a car tire. it lands with a thud. rooney then uses the bucket controls moves backward and up a touch higher toward the transformer not exactly watching how close he is getting. he stops. watches. an entire junked motorcycle flies into the air, discarded, twirling, and crash lands, out of sight. rooney is stunned. as the metallic rummaging sounds continue, rooney moves the bucket even higher when suddenly his bucket beep beeps loudly a warning he's too high and he suddenly stops it and the beeping stops but so do the rummaging sounds. silence, save for the eerie hum of power. he waits. nothing. wants a better view, so he begins to lower the bucket. we're in a wide shot, seeing his descend, painfully slowly. then we're in a long lens close up of rooney as he slowly drops tight on him as he's looking over toward the salvage yard and it takes us a minute to realize there's fucking something behind him so big we didn't see it coming out of the shadows it's got muscle and flesh and it makes an ungodly sound and it instantly grabs him the truck rocks}
