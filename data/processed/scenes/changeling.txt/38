<L>__{interior switchboard room later}
<A>__{christine moves from station to station, the noise level still noticeably low. every time she approaches an operator, they lower their voices, as if not to bother her. one operator holds up a pink request sheet. christine starts toward her, but then the operator glances to another supervisor and hands it off. knowing she has to do something about this, she turns to the room and, in a firm, clear voice, says:}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{excuse me, can i have your attention?}
<A>__{the room grows quiet. everyone is looking at her.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{listen, everyone, i appreciate your consideration, but i'm not made of porcelain. i won't break down and cry if the station to station call to kankakee doesn't go through.}
<P>__{(a thin smile)}
<D>__{actually, i...promised myself that i wouldn't cry...wouldn't let myself cry...until i knew, one way or another, what....}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{point is...i like the noise here. so don't be afraid to talk and...push buttons, and drop things. if it wasn't noisy, how would i know i was in the right place?}
<A>__{she manages a thin smile as the place returns to normal.}
