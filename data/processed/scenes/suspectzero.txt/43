<L>__{interior hope house basement moments later}
<A>__{we are staring at a basement wall that has been covered, floor to ceiling, with 1,000 identical renderings of that same symbol: the circle with a slash through it.}
<L>__{1,000 of them, in bright red paint, against pitch black}
<A>__{enamel. only a machine could have achieved this kind of repetition. or a maniac. this basement is leaky, drafty, poorly lit. but it's also quiet: the sound of that awful singing upstairs has been muted by the basement door and the rain itself.}
<C>__{dyson}
<D>__{benjamin spent hours down here.}
<A>__{mackelway takes it all in, every corner of this basement. he notes a row of standing gym lockers.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<P>__{(re: lockers)}
<D>__{did he have access to those?}
<C>__{dyson}
<D>__{no. they're staff only.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{would you mind opening them for me?}
<A>__{dyson shrugs; he thinks it's a waste of time but he'll do it. mackelway follows him across the dank room.}
<C>__{mackelway }
<D>__{he was here... seven years you said?}
<C>__{dyson}
<D>__{off and on. it's not uncommon for our guests to vanish for months at a time.}
<A>__{dyson works a combination lock on the first locker.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{i ran the name through our database, just to be sure. there's never been an agent benjamin o'ryan in the bureau.}
<C>__{dyson}
<D>__{no... but as elaborate fantasies go, it was one of my favorites.}
<P>__{(fondly)}
<D>__{and he always seemed so sincere about it.}
<A>__{dyson half chuckles; he always liked the guy... he throws open the locker. inside, nothing. mackelway indicates the next locker. dyson works the combination.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{is that what you called him? benjamin?}
<C>__{dyson}
<D>__{it's what he wished to be called.}
<A>__{locker #2 is opened also empty. only one locker left.}
<C>__{dyson }
<P>__{(re: locker #3)}
<D>__{that one's mine.}
<A>__{mackelway shrugs: "sorry, it has to be opened." dyson sighs, then works the combination. mackelway waits. locker #3 is opened. inside, nothing incriminating: a sweater, some old junk, two trophies. dyson eyes him: "see?" mackelway nods. dyson shuts the locker. mackelway looks to that wall: 1,000 copies of the circle with a slash through it. no idea what they signify...}
<C>__{dyson }
<D>__{he painted one of the walls in his room, too.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{can i see it?}
<C>__{dyson}
<D>__{we've painted it over.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{still, might be helpful.}
<A>__{dyson heads for the stairs. they're wooden slats with more basement junk stored below: old sporting equipment, an old vaccuum cleaner, broken chairs, rusted patio furniture. mackelway follows. they climb...}
<C>__{mackelway }
<D>__{wait.}
<A>__{they stop. something just caught mackelway's eye, visible beneath these stairs: a box, with a bucket of paint sticking out of it...}
