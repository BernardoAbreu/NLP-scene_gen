<A>__{camera pulls back from charles wheeler on the stand...}
<C>__{belinda}
<D>__{why did you recruit andrew beckett to your firm?}
<A>__{andrew uses all his strength to concentrate. charles wheeler speaks with great sincerity.}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{if you're the owner of a major league ball club, you recruit the hot rookie. and andy was tremendously promising as a young attorney. that's why we went after him, that's why we hired him, and that's why we stuck with him, year after year... waiting for the promise to be fulfilled. but it never was.}
<C>__{belinda}
<D>__{you kept giving him another chance?}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{of course we did. when you've groomed someone they way we groomed andy, nurturing him, lavishing all kinds of special treatment on him... you've made quite an investment. we were waiting for his promise to kick in, and deliver. but, ultimately, we could no longer ignore the gap between the promise and the reality... this is one of the saddest times in my life. to sit in this court, testifying to andy's ultimate failure to make the grade. to discover that he is one of those people who wants to benefit by the system, but doesn't want to play by the system's rules. to think you know someone, only to find out... you don't know them at all. it's heartbreaking.}
<C>__{belinda}
<D>__{thank you. that's all for now, your honor.}
<C>__{judge garnett}
<D>__{mr. miller?}
<A>__{joe rises. adjusts his jacket. wheeler waits.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(very gentle)}
<D>__{explain to me, if you can, mr. wheeler, explain this to me like i'm a ten year old. this trial is not about a disease, is that what you're saying?}
<A>__{not about your}
<D>__{understandable, if unfounded, fear of catching aids through casual contact with someone who has it? you're saying, this trial is about andrew beckett's character. am i getting this right?}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{yes, character. to the extent that it affects a person's ability to do a great job.}
<A>__{andrew looks away face shiny with sweat, breathing difficult. he takes in the rest of the court, while wheeler's words throb through the air...}
<C>__{wheeler }
<D>__{andy worked when he wanted to work, telling us what he thought we needed to know about his lifestyle...}
<A>__{andrew's pov on rachel, sitting among the spectators. rachel begins speaking, her words overlapping wheeler's (we should get the feeling she's giving her testimony).}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i didn't mind covering for andy, but i did wonder... when was he planning to deal with his problem?}
<A>__{andrew blinks... what's going on? looking back to the court: joe presses in on wheeler. everything seems normal.}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{sometimes it seems like society is run by these kinds of people.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what kind of people?}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{people who want to bend the rules...}
<A>__{andrew's pov kenneth killcoyne at the defense table:}
<C>__{killcoyne}
<D>__{if you want to be a leader in this society, you have to make certain sacrifices.}
<A>__{wheeler keeps speaking:}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{... to suit their personal desires, and the rest of us have to live with it.}
<A>__{andrew's pov walter kenton:}
<C>__{kenton}
<D>__{you have to make a decision: is this guy partner material?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{who makes the rules, mr. wheeler?}
<A>__{you? andrew's pov bob seidman:}
<C>__{seidman}
<D>__{yes, i did see the lesions. i suspected he was sick...}
<A>__{close on andrew: closing his eyes. the voices get louder, fighting with each other:}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{the everyday, common person with decent values...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{it seems like he wasn't willing to face the reality of his situation...}
<A>__{andrew slowly rises, the voices getting louder:}
<C>__{seidman}
<D>__{i didn't tell the others, i was afraid to...}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{... but now, we're standing up for ourselves...}
<C>__{seidman}
<D>__{... but we shouldn't have fired him...}
<C>__{wheeler}
<D>__{... it's time to get this society back on track!}
<A>__{andrew opens his eyes... we switch to his pov: the judge, the jury everyone silent, looking concerned. andrew's pov of the courtroom floor. andrew falls into his own pov shot. in slow motion. he lies on the floor, looking up. andrew's pov joe steps over him.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{could you call an ambulance, please?}
