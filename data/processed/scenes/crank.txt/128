<A>__{chev’s dialog continues over the flashback. chev is retrieving a hidden gun from the kitchen, checking the clip, the barrel, the action, and slipping out a side door into a red corridor past two chinese men in black suits.}
<C>__{chev }
<D>__{i kill people. i’m a professional hitman. i freelance for a major west coast crime syndicate.}

<L>__{int thousand cranes, private room night (flashback)}
<A>__{don kim sits at the head of the table, drinking alone.}
<C>__{chev }
<D>__{last night was a job like a hundred others. a high dollar hit. nothing special.}
<A>__{chev walks up behind him, gun drawn to the back of kim’s head... cocks the hammer back. don kim spins around in shock, the same reaction we saw in the scene 1 flashback frozen, saucer eyed. chev’s eyes steel... his finger tightens...}
<D>__{chev (v.o.) (cont’d) and then out of nowhere this insane idea comes in through the back of my head like a .45 slug at close range...}
<A>__{silence hangs heavy in the room... chev holds the gun to don kim’s head, paralyzed with indecision.}
<C>__{don kim}
<D>__{well? what are you waiting for?}
<A>__{with a last grimace like even he can’t believe what he’s doing, chev lets his gun hand drop slowly to his side.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{congratulations.}
<C>__{don kim}
<D>__{did i win something?}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{your life, jackass.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{a hundred grand wants you dead, so sooner or later it’s going to happen. but i’m not doing it.}
<C>__{don kim}
<D>__{i see.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{instead, you’re going to do something for me. you’re going to get out of town. disappear. i don’t care where you go, i don’t care what you do, so long as you’re invisible for 48 hours. that’s all i ask.}
<C>__{don kim}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{48 hours.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{or if you prefer, we can do it the other way, the way where i go to work and you go meet buddah.}
