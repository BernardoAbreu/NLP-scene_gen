A surgical dressing covers half her face. As we pull back a little we see that two YOUNG MEN sit either side of her. They are STEPHAN GOLD (thirties) thick- set, capable, and DAVID PERETZ (late twenties), dark-haired and pale-faced. The three faces in the darkness, each looking straight ahead - something from a Caravaggio painting. The roaring, which we realise is the sound of ENGINES, gradually runs down into silence. The light from the bay door which is opening off-screen begins to flood the scene with HARSH DAYLIGHT, revealing the inside of a CARGO PLANE. Stephan turns to look at the growing light.

As she positions the last pot we REVOLVE around her to get our first view of the far wall. And there, tied to a radiator, is DIETER VOGEL, now 50. He's bound, his mouth taped, apparently asleep. Rachel doesn't, of course, react to this sight. Instead she begins to clear away some pieces of BROKEN GLASS BOWL from the floor. We TRACK with her as she walks back down the short hallway into the kitchen, drops the pieces of bowl into the bin. From the living room comes the three distinct PINGS of rainwater dripping in the pots. She stops suddenly, puzzled. It's a moment before she works out what she's noticed - something has changed in the sound of the rainwater next door. There are only two drips instead of three. She walks back towards the living room... RACHEL'S P.O.V - through the living room door we can see that one of the pots has been overturned. Rachel slows to a stop. A sudden wave of adrenalin causes her to turn but...it's too late. Vogel steps out of the alcove he's been standing in so that he is directly in front of her. Before she can even cry out he has slashed her face open with a SHARD OF GLASS. Instinctively she cups her hands to her ripped face. Vogel grabs her by the hair and stepping behind her, tries to worm his other hand underneath her raised arms to reach her throat with the glass. Her training kicking in, Rachel uses a krav magah move to grab and twist Vogel's forearm, breaking his hold on her and turning the arm until, with a yell of pain, Vogel drops the shard. He swings wildly at her, but Rachel ducks the fist and drives the palm of her hand up into his face. Vogel stumbles back, surprised by her speed and the sudden pain of the blow. Rachel is about to press home the attack but is blinded by blood from her wound washing into her eyes. As she wipes her eyes clear, Vogel grabs a LAMP from a small chest of drawers in the hall and smashes it into her face. She falls. Vogel begins to run, but, driven by adrenaline and desperation, Rachel scrambles onto all fours and lunges at him, catching hold of his trouser leg as he moves towards the front door. Vogel stumbles, manages to pull a leg free and stamps down on Rachel who lets go with a moan. He stamps again, steps free and kicks her hard in the head. Rachel rolls with the force of the kick and comes to a rest, losing consciousness.

She glances up at Vogel, checking him. He is still slumped, eyes closed. We TRACK with her as she walks back into the kitchen. From the living room comes the three distinct PINGS of rainwater dripping in the pots. She drops the pieces of bowl into the bin and stops, puzzled. It's a moment before she works out what she's noticed - something has changed in the sound of the rainwater next door. There only two drips instead of three. She walks back towards the living room... RACHEL'S P.O.V - through the living room door we can see that one of the pots has been overturned. Rachel slows to a stop. A sudden wave of adrenalin causes her to turn but...it's too late. Vogel steps out of the alcove he's been standing in so that he is directly in front of her. Before she can even cry out he has slashed her face open with a SHARD OF GLASS. Instinctively she cups her hands to her ripped face. Vogel grabs her by the hair and stepping behind her, tries to worm his other hand underneath her raised arms to reach her throat with the glass. Her training kicking in, Rachel uses a krav magah move to grab and twist Vogel's forearm, breaking his hold on her and turning the arm until, with a yell of pain, Vogel drops the shard. He swings wildly at her, but Rachel ducks the fist and drives the palm of her hand up into his face. Vogel stumbles back, surprised by her speed and the sudden pain of the blow. Rachel is about to press home the attack but is blinded by blood from her wound washing into her eyes. As she wipes her eyes clear, Vogel grabs a LAMP from a small chest of drawers in the hall and smashes it into her face. She falls. Vogel begins to run, but, driven by adrenaline and desperation, Rachel scrambles onto all fours and lunges at him, catching hold of his trouser leg as he moves towards the front door. Vogel stumbles, manages to pull a leg free and stamps down on Rachel who lets go with a moan. He stamps again, steps free and kicks her hard in the head. Rachel rolls with the force of the kick and comes to a rest, losing consciousness.
