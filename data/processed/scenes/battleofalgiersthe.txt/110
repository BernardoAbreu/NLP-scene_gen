<A>__{all of them have machine guns. ramel is very tall and robust, about thirty years old. si mourad is slightly older than ramel. his movements are slow and precise; his glance expresses patience and authority. djamila is waiting for them.}
<C>__{djamila}
<D>__{you can come out. thank god. there were so many this time, about ten.}
<A>__{ali recloses the hiding place.}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{paratroopers?}
<C>__{djamila}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{what do you think? did they come here on purpose or by accident?}
<C>__{djamila}
<D>__{no. by accident. they asked some questions, but they didn't touch anyone.}
<A>__{ali has come out of the wash house. the sun is high, and helicopters are seen passing one another in the sky. on some faraway terraces, bivouacs of paras are visible. they are guarding the casbah from above. the rumble of motors and the voice of the loudspeaker are heard more clearly as they near the house.}
<C>__{loudspeaker}
<D>__{"attention! attention! inhabitants of the casbah! the terrorist ben amin has been executed this morning. qrara normendine has been arrested. boussalem ali has been arrested. bel kasel maussa has been arrested. inhabitants of the casbah! the nfl has been defeated. rebel against the remaining terrorists who want to force you to continue a bloody and futile struggle. people of the casbah, the terrorist ben amin has been executed. help us to build a free and peaceful algeria. inhabitants of the casbah, the nlf has been defeated. rebel against the remaining terrorists who want to force you to continue a bloody and futile struggle. attention! attention! inhabitants of the casbah! the terrorist ben amin has been executed this morning. qrara normendine has been arrested. boussalem ali has been arrested. bel kasem moussa has been arrested. inhabitants of the casbah the nlf has been defeated ..."}
<A>__{the voice fades away and is no longer heard. at the same time, a woman has come up from the floor below, carrying a tray of cups and a teapot. ali looks at her quickly, but then watching her more closely, he sees that she is crying. when she passes near him, he stops her, places his hand kindly on her shoulder, and asks her in arabic why she is crying.}
<B>__{dialogue in arabic between ali and woman.}
<A>__{the woman shakes her head, tries to smile, but says nothing. then she enters the wash house silently and begins to serve the tea.}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{it's better to split up, to increase our chances. we must change hiding places, and change them continually ... in the meantime, we must make new contacts, replace our arrested brothers, reorganize our sections }
<C>__{ali}
<P>__{(interrupting him)}
<D>__{yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{of course. as soon as possible.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{no, immediately. the people are demoralized. leave this to me ...}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{no. not you, or any one of us. as long as we are free, the nlf continues to exist in the casbah. if they manage to take us too, there won't be anything left ... and from nothing comes nothing ...}
<C>__{ramel}
<P>__{(intervening)}
<D>__{but it's also necessary to do something ...}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{and we will do something, don't worry. as soon as we have reestablished contacts ...}
<C>__{mourad}
<D>__{and our movements?}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{for this too we've got to change methods.}
