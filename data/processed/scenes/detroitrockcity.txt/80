<L>__{interior smiley mart night}
<A>__{the store is crawling with kiss fans, some reading the comic books, others playing pinball against a far wall, still others looking at the poster section. trip enters on a mission. he looks around catching the eye of a pretty cashier. she's a rocker, wearing a who tee shirt, a mood ring, and just a little too much make up. she smiles at him. trip returns the smile with a feeble wave. her mood ring turns from blue to pink. concentrating on the layout of the store, trip peers all the way to the back to a darkened corner... where he spies a little kid wearing a kiss tee shirt playing a kiss pinball machine. trip smiles. the eagle has spotted a fuzzy, little bunny. he moves in for the kill, walking past a crowd of kids at the magazine rack, past the hostess aisle, past the dairy cooler and into the darkened corner. he stands behind the little kid, relishing this moment. the kid is actually pretty good. we also see now the little kid has his face painted like ace frehley.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{hey, little kid.}
<A>__{suddenly distracted, the kid loses the ball.}
<C>__{little kid}
<D>__{shit! you just skunked my last ball, you...}
<A>__{trip clamps a hand over the little kid's mouth.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{okay, booger, your kiss ticket or your life.}
<A>__{the little kid says something but trip's hand muffles his words.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{hunh?}
<A>__{the kid says what he said before, but it is utterly incomprehensible, once again thanks to trip's hand.}
<C>__{trip}
<P>__{(looking at his hand)}
<D>__{oh. okay... but scream and you'll never live to see puberty. i will pop your fuckin' face in.}
<A>__{trip pulls his hand away.}
<C>__{little kid}
<D>__{please sir, don't beat me up. i do have a kiss ticket, but not on me.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{a likely story. hand it over, kid.}
<C>__{little kid}
<P>__{(bottom lip quivering)}
<D>__{no really. my brother's hanging onto it for safe keeping. please, let me get him for you.}
<A>__{the kid turns and yells into the store before trip can stop him.}
<C>__{little kid}
<D>__{hey, chongo!}
<A>__{a titanic guy at the comic book rack looks up from his issue of "thing" when he hears his name. chongo has a very low forehead and the expression of an angry bull plastered onto his face.}
<C>__{trip}
<P>__{(getting scared)}
<D>__{hey, kid, that's okay. i don't wanna see kiss that ba...}
<C>__{little kid}
<D>__{don't try to run, maggot. chongo's an all state track star in every event.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{little kid}
<P>__{(gleefully)}
<D>__{a tag on your toe. nobody threatens me and lives.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{look, you can have my wallet...}
<C>__{little kid}
<D>__{it's not nearly enough, punk.}
<A>__{chongo is getting ever closer with his tree trunk legs, his barrel chest and hydraulic biceps. he is joined by two buds.}
<C>__{little kid}
<D>__{besides, i was gonna take your wallet anyway. after chongo and his friends crush your ribcage like a pack of luckys.}
<A>__{chongo arrives eyeing trip with distaste. trip goes white.}
<C>__{chongo}
<D>__{this fairy givin' you shit, bro?}
<C>__{little kid}
<D>__{he was gonna mug me for my kiss ticket.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{me? mug? that's nuts. i said, do you know where i can take a piss.}
<A>__{chongo and his two buds laugh. then, without a second of warning, chongo belts trip in the gut. trip doubles over and falls breathlessly to his knees.}
<C>__{chongo}
<D>__{okay, pimple dick, you've got the option of walking outside with us or gettin' dragged out. either way you're comin' with us.}
<A>__{trip catches his breath.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{please, sir, don't kick my ass! i will do anything to get out of a beating!}
<C>__{little kid}
<D>__{say, chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the kiss concert our weasly friend won't be attending.}
<A>__{chongo scratches his head.}
<C>__{chongo}
<D>__{how much cash do you figure?}
<C>__{little kid}
<D>__{take five for a minute, chongo. let me do the math.}
<A>__{the little kid taps his finger on his chin and the theme from "jeopardy" begins. while the kid thinks, trip looks nervously up at chongo and his buds. chongo reaches into his denim vest pocket and we hear a crinkling noise. he comes back up with two walnuts, putting them between his bicep and forearm. trip watches in horror as chongo makes a muscle and the walnuts are shelled between two walls of iron hard flesh. creeeaaaack! chongo eats the walnuts, shells and all.}
