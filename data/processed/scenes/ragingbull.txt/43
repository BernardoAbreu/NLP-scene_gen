<L>__{interior copacabana lounge night (1947)}
<A>__{a comedian is in the middle of his act. jake, vickie, joey, and janet sit at a nearby table. janet, an attractive blonde, is are of joey's girlfriends; the moment you set eyes on her, you know this is not his wife. the lounge is very crowded. the comedian interrupts his routine to point out that jake lamotta is in the audience, and even tries a little harmless joking at jake's expense.}
<C>__{comedian}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, i'd like to point out a special guest we have with us tonight the raging bull, the bronx bull, mr. jake lamotta.}
<A>__{there is applause. jake smiles, and gives a hesitant wave.}
<C>__{comedian }
<D>__{stand up, jake, c'mon. oh, you are standing. sorry.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{just kiddin', jake.}
<A>__{jake waves a fist at the comedian, good naturedly playing along with the joke even though he hates it.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(to joey)}
<D>__{look at this abuse i gotta take.}
<A>__{joey, vickie, and janet are amused.}
<C>__{jake }
<P>__{(joking)}

<P>__{(to janet)}
<D>__{what's your name again, darling?}
<C>__{janet}
<D>__{janet.}
<A>__{jake smiles. they all drink. salvy, a little older, but still young looking, and dressed even better than when we last saw him (flashy rings, etc.), comes over to their table. he walks around like he owns the fucking place. jake hates it.}
<C>__{salvy}
<D>__{hi, joey. jake, how you doin'? vickie...}
<A>__{they respond. jake is cold towards salvy. salvy goes on his way to como's table. as salvy walks away, jake turns to vickie.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{what're you lookin' at? you lookin' at him?}
<C>__{vickie}

<D>__{don't tell me "no." i saw you lookin' at him. why, you like him?}
<C>__{vickie}
<D>__{i'm not interested in him.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{you're not interested in him?}
<C>__{vickie}
<D>__{no, i'm not.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{in other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?}
<C>__{vickie}
<D>__{jake, c'mon now. don't start.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(turns to joey, referring to salvy)}
<D>__{look at this, all of a sudden everybody's a fuckin' romeo around here. did you see the way she was lookin' at him?}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{nah, she would never...}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{didn't you just see her lookin' at him? she told me no, but i don't believe her.}
<C>__{joey}
<P>__{(uncomfortable)}
<D>__{c'mon, jake. you know she's crazy about you.}
<A>__{jake gives him a suspicious look. joey feels uneasy.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i'd just love to catch her. oooooh, i'd just love to catch her once.}
<A>__{drinks arrive at their table.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{these are from tommy como.}
<A>__{jake looks up but can't see where como is. joey gets up.}
<C>__{joey}
<P>__{(to jake)}
<D>__{excuse me for a minute. be right back.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{don't be long. i'm afraid with all these tough guys here.}
<A>__{joey goes to como's table in the rear of the lounge. jake slides over and watches. joey shakes hands with como. salvy is there at como's table. joey comes right back.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{jake, come over for a few minutes. tommy wants to say hello to you. c'mon, just come and say hello.}
<A>__{jake doesn't like the idea, but goes along with it anyway. another angle: como's table. jake comes over.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{hi, tommy. how are you?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{jake, sit down for a minute.}
<A>__{jake sits. salvy smiles and nods to jake. jake barely nods back.}
<C>__{tommy }
<P>__{(his arm around jake)}
<D>__{fuckin' kid! you're the best fuckin' fighter around. loved what you did to satterfield. them "moulan yans" forget about it. they're all afraid to fight you.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(a little embarrassed)}
<D>__{c'mon, tommy }
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{how you feelin'? ok? you feelin' good?}
<C>__{jake}

<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{how's the weight? ok?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{yeah, the weight's ok.}
<A>__{another pause. tommy smiles and moves closer to jake.}
