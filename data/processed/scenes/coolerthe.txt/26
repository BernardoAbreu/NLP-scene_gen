<L>__{exterior shangri la parking lot night}
<A>__{bernie weaves his way through the lot to his car. arriving at his buick, he's startled to find natalie leaning against it. she holds up the $100 chip the drunk tipped her.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{buy you a drink?}
<A>__{off of bernie's surprised expression...}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior the makawao bar and grill night}
<A>__{cheesy polynesian decor. mood lighting = an excuse to keep the electric down. basically, a joint where people come to lose themselves. natalie and bernie are seated in a booth near the back. she sips on an umbrella drink; he's nursing his usual gin. natalie has an astrological chart in front of her. in between sips, she makes annotations to the chart.}
<C>__{natalie}
<P>__{(almost to herself)}
<D>__{your progressed venus is gemini, 12.5 degrees, and is in direct motion. which tells me that you're a slow starter when it comes to romance.}
<P>__{(off bernie's taken aback expression)}
<D>__{you know what? this is real unprofessional of me. i shouldn't discuss your chart with you until i'm all done. i can tell by that look, you think this is all a lot of b.s.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{no... i just know what the outcome's going to be.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{the outcome? there's not, like, one particular outcome. a lot of things enter into it. the planets, moon phases...}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{the outcome won't change with me. it'll be all bad.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{god, i have never met anyone who was so down on themselves. i used to be down on myself, ok? i don't go there anymore. i've got just three more correspondence classes with this stuff, then i will have my certificate and everything. and you know how i got ok?}
<C>__{bernie}
<P>__{(deadpan)}
<D>__{you had your chart done.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{yes, as a matter of fact that is perfectly correct.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{do you know what i do at the shangri la?}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{i asked around. you're a "cooler." you turn winners into losers.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{and do you know how i do that?}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{i know there's stuff that goes on in casinos all the time }
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{i do it by being myself. people get next to me and their luck turns. it's always been that way.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{that sounds to me like a self fulfilling prophecy. there's a whole chapter on that in my course. anyways, i can see a big factor in your life is that you're lacking companionship. there's nobody to deflect off. if you've got, as you put it, bad karma, then you need someone with good karma to neutralize it. well, that's my take on it anyway.}
<A>__{bernie maintains eye contact with natalie for an extended beat. then drops his head, gazes at his glass.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{i don't know about you, but i'm real tired.}
<A>__{natalie nods. bernie motions to stand. natalie just remains seated. keeps talking.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{i have this recurring dream where i'm on some beautiful island in the bahamas. i'm sitting on the beach, taking in this amazing sunset with one of these in my hand}
<P>__{(gestures to her drink)}
<D>__{...and then it starts to rain. and i wake up and it's my roof leaking on me. yeah, i'm also real tired, bernie.}
<C>__{bernie}
<P>__{(not even sure why}
<D>__{he's telling her}
<P>__{this)}
<D>__{i only got six more days. well, almost five really. then i will be leaving town.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{only five more days?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{then we shouldn't waste any more time.}
<A>__{natalie covers bernie's hand with hers.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{why don't we go back to your place?}
<C>__{bernie}
<P>__{(completely caught off guard)}
<D>__{i, uh... if this is... i don't know... i don't know if i can afford...}
<A>__{natalie flinches slightly. then swiftly regains her composure. it's vegas. an honest mistake.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{oh god... i'm so sorry... i didn't mean... you see that's exactly what i'm talking about. i've gone and "cooled" the damn table.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{ah, just shut up, bernie. you haven't gone and cooled anything. not by a long shot.}
