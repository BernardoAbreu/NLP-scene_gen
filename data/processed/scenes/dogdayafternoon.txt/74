<L>__{exterior bank night}
<A>__{as sonny walks to his mother. baker tactfully moves away, leaving the two of them in the center of the floodlighted street. again the crowd can be heard but not seen; armed police fringe the lights and shadows, in b.g.}

<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{she doesn't have anything to do with it! you understand that? mother? this is me!}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{i know you wouldn't need leon if heidi was treating you right. the thing i don't understand is why you come out and sleep with heidi anyway? you got two kids on welfare now. what're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?}

<A>__{she stares at him. he talks slowly and carefully to her.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{i'm a fuckup and an outcast. there isn't one single person in my life i haven't hurt through my love. you understand that? i'm the most dangerous person in the world, because if i love you, watch out, you're gonna get fucked, fucked over and fucked out!}

<P>__{(embraces her)}
<D>__{don't talk to the fbi anymore.}
<A>__{he walks away and moves toward the bank door.}
<B>__{on vi}
<A>__{her desperate smile, apologetic and false at the same time, glistens with a mother's tears. after a long beat:}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{i remember how beautiful you were. as a baby you were so beautiful. we had such hopes.}
