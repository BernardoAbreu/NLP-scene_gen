<L>__{exterior house}
<A>__{the window explodes outward in a spray of sunlit glass. utah and warchild crash to the ground. the razorhead, with 50 pounds on johnny, rises like a bull. bleeding from superficial lacerations, warchild plows through the hedge. johnny dives after him. the polyester neighbor stands paralyzed as the two crazed figures careen toward him. he is knocked flying, and the roaring lawnmower is flipped onto its side. utah and warchild are locked together. the shotgun lies nearby, out of play. warchild jerks a 6 inch knife free from its sheath, hanging from a thong around his neck. he trusts straight at johnny's throat. johnny deflects the thrust into the whirling lawnmower. ka whanggg!!! the knife is hammered out of warchild's hand. whistles away, spinning. warchild grabs johnny as they scramble, and heaves him bodily toward the spinning blade. utah catches the rim of the mower with both hands, stopping himself inches from the rotor. warchild puts all his weight on johnny. pushing him face first toward the blades. johnny feels the wind on his face. the engine is roaring, full throttle.}
<B>__{pappas appears behind them.}
<A>__{he aims the .38. fires twice. the little briggs & stratton dies young, its casing shattered. the rotor spins to a stop. warchild looks up into the black eye of pappas' gun. two inched from his face.}
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{speak into the microphone.}
<A>__{the razorhead sags, the fight going out of him. babbit kicks him off johnny, face down onto the lawn. cuffs him.}
