<L>__{exterior lake in forest day}
<A>__{at sunset, the four run towards a lake in their underwear. they jump and dive in, and begin splashing each other. john duck dives under the water and swims through the sunlit streaked green water. we see him under the water, swimming towards us, caught by the sun's rays. john surfaces, and wipes the water from his eyes. he spots alexei and nadia playing in the water. alexei grabs her and throws her in the air and she comes down with a splash. john treads water nearby. he watches them both hold their noses and disappear under the surface. they've both vanished. john ducks under the water. john's underwater p.o.v.: it's too murky to see anything. the two surface, breathing hard, laughing. john watches them. alexei holds nadia tight and looks like he might even kiss her. but instead he ducks her and holds her under the water. john treads water nearby. she's been under a long time.}

<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{john begins to swim toward alexei. just as he gets near, alexei lets nadia surface, coughing and spluttering she shouts at alexei in russian, angry. alexei makes for her again but she pushes him away, twice, almost slapping him. she is very uncomfortable. she swims away. yuri admonishes his friend in russian. alexei stares at john, then swims off powerfully back towards the shore.}
