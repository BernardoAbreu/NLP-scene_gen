<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{the lincoln memorial}
<A>__{glorious, alabaster stone floodlit at night. a symbol of all that is good and free and just. hub drives a rental car, staring out at the monuments.}
<B>__{in georgetown}
<A>__{hub pulls up to a lovely townhouse. parked on the street, an unmarked car from the secret service.}
<B>__{the chief of staff}
<A>__{opens the door, wearing a dartmouth lacrosse team t shirt.}
<C>__{chief of staff}
<D>__{c'mon in, we're still trying to get the last one down.}
<A>__{in the background, we hear a three year old crying. in the living room later tasteful antiques, rag rugs and kids' toys.}
<C>__{chief of staff}
<D>__{...the president wants this shit over with. there's only one way to do that.}
<P>__{(looks at hub)}
<D>__{let the sheik go.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{so we do have the sheik?}
<C>__{chief of staff}
<D>__{you think our government operates as a single coherent entity? devereaux just... pushed the agenda.}
<P>__{(carefully)}
<D>__{of course the president was completely unaware of it.}
<C>__{hub}
<P>__{(return of serve)}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{chief of staff}
<D>__{now we can't just let him go. america has to stand tall in the world yadda yadda yadda. so what we do is...}
<P>__{(the punch line)}
<D>__{we let the american justice system do its work.}
<A>__{his wife appears, holding a squalling baby, looking defeated.}
<C>__{wife}
<D>__{ honey...?}
<C>__{chief of staff}
<D>__{i will be right up, darling.}
<A>__{she grits her teeth and goes upstairs.}
<C>__{chief of staff}
<D>__{you have kids? they're great. sometimes you just want to... drug them.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{what do you mean, let the justice system do its work.}
<C>__{chief of staff}
<D>__{we don't release him. a judge releases him. you're an fbi man. that's what judges are good at, right?}
<P>__{(off hub's look)}
<D>__{it's not like we've gone after him in proper prosectorial fashion. kidnaping him. holding him in isolation. "fruit of the poisoned tree" remember that one from law school? oh, we'll have a big trial. everybody'll get their rocks off... but the fact is }
<P>__{(the punch line)}
<D>__{ the sheik will walk.}
<A>__{he looks at hub, shakes his head.}
<C>__{chief of staff}
<D>__{...and this whole episode becomes nothing more than the news cycle before the next news cycle.}
<A>__{he hands hub an accordion file.}
<C>__{chief of staff}
<D>__{documentary evidence of devereaux's whole operation.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{why me?}
<C>__{chief of staff}
<D>__{because you'll know what to do with it.}
<A>__{hub looks at the file in his hands. considering.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{and what about her?}
<C>__{chief of staff}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{you know who. how much is she complicit in all this?}
<C>__{chief of staff}
<D>__{ask her.}
<A>__{hub looks up. sharon emerges from the hallway. sequence from original script. on the streets of georgetown later that night hub and sharon sit in silence in hub's rental car:}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{i ran an iraqi network for two years. samir recruited them from among the sheik's followers. i trained them in the north. then we played them back into baghdad, two, three at a time, hiding them in the mosques...}
<A>__{her voice softens just a bit as memory takes over.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{it was gonna be beautiful.}
<P>__{(looks away)}
<D>__{ and then there was a policy shift }
<A>__{she thought telling the story would be easy, but there's an enormous well of untapped feeling. she fights it back:}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{ the new doctrine was: iran will be too powerful if iraq falls apart.}
<P>__{(her voice trembles)}
<D>__{and it's not like... we sold them out. exactly. we just... stopped... helping them. and i wasn't allowed to tell them what was coming down. i was ordered not to tell them.}
<P>__{(fighting back tears)}
<D>__{ and they got slaughtered.}
<A>__{she turns away.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{you've got to understand these people... believe. paradise. bliss. to us they're just words. but to them... it's very beautiful, actually. and when you look at their lives, the heartbreak... and what do we do? we think, aha, we can take advantage of that.}
<P>__{(losing it)}
<D>__{so i quit. i came home. i just can't... do it... anymore.}
<A>__{she doesn't want to reveal herself this way. doesn't want to be vulnerable. doesn't want to cling to him. for a moment he puts his arms around her, but it's like holding a beautiful, dangerous predator.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{ but first, you helped them.}
<A>__{she senses the hardness in his tone. looks up at him, and through tears, puts her game face back on.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{what do you mean ?}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{they were being slaughtered. they needed to get out. but they were on the watch list. so you got them visas. you and samir.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{i promised we would take care of them. they were working... for us.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{doing what, exactly?}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{i don't know what you mean.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{you said you trained them. tradecraft. subversion. that's what you said, right?}
<P>__{(she nods)}
<D>__{only you left something out, didn't you... didn't you, sharon?}
<P>__{(she can't bring}
<D>__{herself to look at}
<P>__{him)}
<D>__{you taught them how to make bombs.}
<A>__{the tears are streaming down her face now. finally, she nods.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{ and now they're here, doing what you taught 'em.}
<A>__{the streetlight catches sharon's face. her eyes are haunted.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{and i'm going to have to live with the hell of that for the rest of my life.}
