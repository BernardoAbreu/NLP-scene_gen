<A>__{in her mirrors, catherine spots the lincoln charging toward her along the emergency lane. her demeanor is just as predatory as james's, and she does not hesitate to react. catherine cranks the steering wheel to the right and dives across two lanes of startled vehicles to fishtail down a little used utility access road. behind her, and closing rapidly, the lumbering lincoln follows suit.}

<A>__{around the decreasing radius curve of the utility road, the more nimble sports car stretches out the distance between it and the lincoln, but once the road uncurls, the booming v 8 allows the american car to gobble up the ground until it is nose to tail with catherine's car. james begins to bump the tail of the sports car, breaking off the accelerator for a beat to let the white car which looks especially fragile and delicate by comparison get away a bit, then charging back until it makes contact. now the road ahead curves again, and just as catherine enters the curve, james gives her a seriously violent jolt. the rear of her car slews off on to the grass verge, almost comes back, then loses traction completely. catherine's car spins backwards off the road, then rolls unceremoniously, almost gently, down a small grade, shedding bits and pieces, until it finally flops to a halt on its side in front of a cement culvert.}
