<D>__{september 7th, 1988 was the first time i saw you. you were reading `the great gatsby' and wearing a guns n roses t shirt. i'd never seen anything so perfect. i remember thinking i had to have you or i'd die... not in a psycho kinda way but in that beautiful, innocent, unaffected way that way only a 17 year old kid can have. you whispered you loved me at the homecoming dance and i felt so peaceful and safe because i knew no matter what happened from that night on nothing could ever be that bad because i had you. and then i grew up, lost my way and blamed you for my failures. but i was never lost. i'd just forgotten the way life makes you forget as you grow older. and i never failed at anything because on that september day you said `yes' to me. and at that dance you said you loved me. and as i stand here... as i write this, i want you to know if i don't have you i will die... not in a psycho way but in that beautiful, innocent, unaffected way only a 17 year old kid can have... .oh and... p.s... i'm `hungry like the wolf'.}
