<P>__{(languidly, in pain)}
<D>__{who are you putting into that bed?}
<C>__{lischen}
<D>__{we have the corporal, wounded, to you bringing.}

<D>__{a corporal? turn him out. schicken sie herrn koporal weg!}

<A>__{lischen brings roderick a refreshing drink; and, as he takes it, he presses the kind hand that gave it to him; nor does this token of his gratitude seem unwelcome.}
<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{i found lischen the tenderest of nurses. whenever any delicacy was to be provided for the wounded lieutenant, a share was always sent to the bed opposite his, and to the avaricious man's no small annoyance.}
<A>__{lischen serving food. various cuts, representing different days. lakenham behaving as rottenly as roderick describes:}
<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{nor was i the only person in the house to whom the worthy gentleman was uncivil. he ordered the fair lischen hither and thither, made impertinent love to her, abused her soups, quarreled with her omelettes, and grudged the money which was laid out for his maintenance, so that our hostess detested him as much as, i think, without vanity, as she regarded me.}
<A>__{roderick making lover to lischen while lieutenant lakenham sulks in the next bed.}
<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{for if truth must be told, i had made very deep love to her during my stay under her roof, as is always my way with women, of whatever age or degree of beauty. do not think me very cruel and heartless, ladies; this heart of lischen's was like many a town, which had been stormed and occupied several times before i came to invest it,}
<A>__{roderick sitting up in bed. lischen has just served him his supper. enter a british officer, an aide who carries a notebook, and a surgeon. in a brief scene to be written, we learn that a sudden movement on the part of the french requires the british army to follow them. the town is to be evacuated, except for some prussian line of communication troops, whose surgeons are to visit the wounded in the place; and, when they are well, they are to be drafted to their regiments.}
<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{i began to reflect how pleasant my quarters were to me, and that i was much better here than crawling under an odious tent with a parcel of tipsy soldiers, or going the night rounds, or rising long before daybreak for drill. i determined that i never would join mine again.}
