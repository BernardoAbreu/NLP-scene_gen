<A>__{conners approaches...}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{i think this lorenz was trying to tell us something.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{you don't say.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{the way he spoke... he paused before certain words. have you ever heard of the chaos theory?}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{what?}
<L>__{interior diner near the bank day}
<A>__{a grade "b" rating, tops. customers dine, choke down coffee. at a booth empty plates and crumpled napkins litter the table. conners finishes a cup of coffee, enjoys a slice of pie. dekker, all about work, goes over his notes.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{edward lorenz invented the chaos theory in the 1960's. it's the study of phenomena that appear random, but in fact have an element of regularity which can be described mathematically.}
<C>__{conners}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{try that again?}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{pretty much... initial state of events may seem unrelated and random, but eventually patterns emerge and in the end all the pieces fit together.}
<A>__{the waitress refills conners' coffee, lays down the check.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{anything else, officers?}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{that'll be all.}
<P>__{(to dekker)}
<D>__{you're a college boy. which one? someplace i've heard of or one of those inbred state schools no one's heard of?}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{u dub.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{not exactly princeton, but not bad. how did you end up on the force?}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{it's kind of the family business.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{family business? what, your dad, dad's dad and so on and so back?}
<A>__{dekker squirms when it comes to revealing personal info.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{do we really need all this "get to know you" crap? couple hours ago you didn't give a shit.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{you've grown on me. besides, i am entrusting my life to you. i should know something about you. i would}
<C>__{conners }
<D>__{think you'd like to know a little something about me.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{i know about you, detective. everyone does.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{you don't say that with much enthusiasm.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{not much to be enthusiastic about.}
<A>__{conners reaches his limit. time to put him in place.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{listen, my reputation often proceeds me. you, however, have no reputation; a fact i need to deal with. after you've been through the shit i have, then you can judge me. now... we can try to work together, make the best of a bad situation or we can compare dick sizes all day... up to you. but since this is your first day here... today... mine's bigger.}
<C>__{vincent }
<P>__{(over radio)}
<D>__{conners, come in?}
<A>__{both men hold steely stares on one another. until...}
<C>__{conners}
<P>__{(into radio)}
<D>__{go.}
<C>__{vincent }
<D>__{got something you'll want to see.}
<A>__{conners drops a ten dollar bill on the table.}
<C>__{conners}
<D>__{lastly... i don't like the pac 10. it's overrated. i'm an ivy league guy.}
<A>__{conners gets up, heads for the door. dekker, humbled, scoops up conners's ten, puts it in his wallet and drops a twenty down on the table, slides out of the booth.}
