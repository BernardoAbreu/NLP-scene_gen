<L>__{exterior mons veritatis day}
<A>__{tiny figures cross a causeway of vines connecting a small island of unobtanium to the main mass of mons veritatis. wide shot looking down a rock face bigger than half dome the sheer side of mons veritatis. banshees circle next to the cliffs, flashing in shafts of sunlight. waterfalls dissolve into nothingness below.}
<L>__{exterior grotto banshee rookery day}
<A>__{a waterfall thunders down into the void like a faucet of the gods. jake looks down the sheer cliff at the world far below a view from olympus. a shriek and the thwap thwap of leathery wings neytiri's banshee swoops in to perch at the edge of the grotto. she dismounts and, like a falconer, covers its eyes with a woven hood. it waits, docile, as she joins jake and the hunter party. tsu'tey leads them through the cave until they emerge onto a cliff face. and jake sees the banshee rookery. hundreds of banshees huddle on rock out croppings as far as the eye can see. they cling to the walls with the fore claws on their wings, or perch on ledges.}
<C>__{tsu'tey}
<D>__{jakesully will go first.}
<A>__{tsu'tey smirks at jake, a challenge in his eyes. the two teenage hunters are scared but trying to act tough. tsu'tey scowls when neytiri leads jake out onto the ledge.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{now you choose your ikran. this you must feel inside. if he also chooses you, move quick, like i showed. you will have one chance.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{how will i know if he chooses me?}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{he will try to kill you.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{outstanding.}
<A>__{out of sight of tsu'tey, neytiri takes his hand and squeezes it. jake feels a rush of emotion, but she breaks away like it didn't happen. he is on his own, on the ledge with the banshees. they eye him as he approaches. several shriek and take flight. others flap their wings and yawn, showing rows of fangs, in a threat display. jake unrolls a weighted leather strap, like a one ended bolo. a large male spreads enormous wings, shrieks, and glares straight at him. jake looks directly into its eyes and strides toward it.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{let's dance.}
<A>__{the challenged banshee hisses and leaps at him, jaws wide as jake times the lunge, swinging the bolo, feinting and then slipping aside as the banshee's jaws miss him, snapping shut. jake whaps the bolo across its snout. the weighted thong whips twice around its long jaws, tying them shut. a muffled scream and it slashes at his stomach with razor talons but jake is already leaping, over the talons and tackling the banshee around the neck. it topples on its side, and he swarms it arms around its thrashing head. jake grabs its whip like antenna and brings it toward his queue but the bony head slams sideways, and bam! clocks him right in the face, almost knocking him out and it writhes, flinging him to the ground. he slides on the rock and almost goes over the edge as neytiri gasps. tsu'tey laughs and yells mockingly. the bolo is coming loose as the creature shakes its head, way pissed off now, but jake scrambles up and leaps straight at it. claws rake his leg but he gets his arms around its head and clamps down hard. they flop to the ground and he scrambles on top, pinning it and grabs its whipping antenna, locks it under his arm, and jams the end of his queue into it. they fuse together and the banshee stops struggling. it lies there panting. they are locked together, literally eye to eye.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{that's right! you're mine.}
<A>__{ecu banshee the pupil like a deep black well. jake relaxes his grip and slowly, warily, slides his leg over the creature's back. neytiri runs to him.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{first flight seals the bond. you cannot wait.}
<A>__{jake sits astride the creature, feeling its power. he grips a hank of the beast's main, and }
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{heeeyyyaaaah!}
<A>__{thwap! thwap! the banshee is off like a shot. jake screams as they plummet off the cliff the banshee wails and they fall together, spiralling out of control, and he is almost tossed lose. the thing is squawking and shrieking so much he can't think.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{shut the hell up!!}
<A>__{it does.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{level out! fly straight!}
<A>__{it levels out. jake cocks his head, only thinking "bank left" and the animal complies. he settles the banshee into an easy loping beat of its huge wings, while he catches his breath. neytiri's banshee falls into formation with him. she signals "follow me" and dives. jake guides his banshee clumsily after her. neytiri's banshee moves with precise movements of its wingtips, while jake's wobbles and dips, almost falling out of the sky. the camera swoops after them as neytiri leads an arcing dive around the flank of mons veritatis. the scenery is stunning. they pass waterfalls and swoop between hanging vines. neytiri leads jake in a sharp bank, skimming close to the cliffs. they punch through streamers of cloud and emerge into sunlight. jake is getting the hang of it. he jinks left, then right, then dives, tucking himself tight against the animal's back. he's reckless, fearless. half in control and loving it. neytiri dives next to him as he lets out a long whoop of joy.}
