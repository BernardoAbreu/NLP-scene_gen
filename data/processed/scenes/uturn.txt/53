<L>__{interior mckenna living room late day}
<A>__{jake sits in an easy chair reading a paper. puffs of smoke from his pipe rise from behind the paper and hang like a cloud over his head. grace stands in the doorway, body stiff and arms crossed, staring at him.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{who was that on the phone?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{wrong number.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{you spent a long time talking for a wrong number. but then you make friends so easily. don't you, grace?}
<A>__{grace has no answer for that, so she says nothing. a long moment passes, then:}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i put up new drapes, jake.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i know. i was here when your apprentice was helping you. remember?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you never said anything. about the drapes.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{they look nice.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you haven't even looked at them once.}
<A>__{jake lowers the paper, looks at the drapes.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{they look nice.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i picked them out for you, jake. i thought you would like the colors.}
<P>__{jake (softly, admiring)}
<D>__{you look just like your mama when you move like that against the light.}
<A>__{grace stares at the chain now visible around jake's neck that disappears under his shirt. she knows that hidden there is a key, and she fixes on it intently.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{what the hell you looking at, girl?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{nothing, jake. absolutely nothing.}
