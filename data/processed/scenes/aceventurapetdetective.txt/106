<L>__{interior tea room night}
<A>__{ace emerges from the basement. the band is between songs. ace strolls by the burnout whose head has now stopped.}
<C>__{ace}
<P>__{(to burnout)}
<D>__{did you get all the spiders outta there?}
<A>__{ace heads out, then freezes. the two thugs that took marino are standing at the exit. then they see ace and start towards him, reaching inside their coats. suddenly the music starts. the burnout's head wails again. his manic gyrations interfere with the thugs long enough for ace to bolt. one of the thugs pushes the burnout violently against the wall as they pursue ace.}
<B>__{burnout}
<P>__{(calling, as he gets up)}
<D>__{thanks, man! you're a great dancer!}
<A>__{ace pushes his way through the crowd. the thugs follow. ace nears the stage. it's wild. people are diving off and getting moshed. before the thugs grab him, ace runs up and throws himself from the stage. the insane crowd begins to pass him around over their heads. the thugs exchange a look, then dive after ace, and a "mosh" chase ensues. ace is passed back onto the stage as the song comes to an end. the singer is lying there exhausted. ace sees the crowd starting to put the thugs down, so he quickly grabs the microphone off the floor.}
<C>__{ace}
<P>__{(screams)}
<D>__{one, two, three, four, spank me mommy!!!}
<A>__{the audience looks at ace for a second. then the band members exchange a look and go for it!! it's a nightmarish little ditty. ace sings like one of satan's minions.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{urghhuurraaaw! arghuurrrreeew!}
<A>__{the crowd seems to understand. they throw the thugs high in the air again and mosh them away from the stage. the thugs are shooting stray bullets the whole time. ace incites the crowd, even more now, with a punching gesture. the crowd follows their new leader, punching with one hand, moshing with the other. the thugs get the living crap "moshed" out of them. when the song ends, ace raises fists in the air. the cheering crowd violently drops the thugs. they're out cold.}
