<L>__{interior apartment living room day}
<A>__{peter and michael have laid mary down on the couch, taking care to place several towels between her bottom and the immaculate velvet. mary is squirming, laughing, feeling great. they have already gone through half a box of cotton in their attempts to clean up the crap. but it's still all over, on their hands, on the baby's feet and legs, on the towels, etc.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{hold her. hold her, goddamn it!}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i can't hold her. this kid's out of control here!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{just gimme the cotton.}
<A>__{michael lets go of mary's feet and she sticks them back in the crap.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{oh for chrissake, don't just let go of her!}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{then get the cotton yourself if you don't want me to let go of her!}
<A>__{peter grabs a huge wad of cotton.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{take the towels off they're full of shit.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{but the couch'll get dirty!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yeah, but she keeps getting it all over herself. man, this shit is sticky!... we need cleaning fluid or something to get it off...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{how 'bout after shave?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{are you kidding?! waste our saint laurent on babyshit?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{okay, let's just put the diaper on and the hell with it.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{michael hands him a diaper. peter tries to figure out how it goes on.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{these tape things do they go on the front or the back?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{how am i supposed to know...?}
<A>__{peter tries to slide the diaper under mary's backside but she squirms and kicks it off with her feet.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{hold her under her arms i'm gonna try it this way.}
<A>__{michael holds mary under her armpits. peter tries to put the diaper on her. it's hard. what's more, it would seem that michael didn't buy the right size the diaper comes all the way up to mary's chin.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{what the hell kind of lousy stinking diapers did you get? they're way too big!}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i don't think they're too big they're ultra absorbent. that's all. the more absorbent the better.}
<A>__{peter has more or less managed to adjust the diaper.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{how the hell do these tape things work? hold her for chrissakes!}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{my arms are getting tired.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{there. i got it.}
<A>__{he tapes the diaper closed.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{damn it. i didn't make it tight enough.}
<A>__{he tapes the other side: the diaper gapes and sags.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{it's not working... what about laying her down?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{go ahead... no, not on the towels, they're all covered with crap...}
<A>__{michael lays mary down right on the couch. peter vigor ously undoes the tape, and the whole plastic lining rips apart.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{... what the hell is this friggin' mess? oh, man, this is unbelievable! to think, they bombard us day and night with their goddamn tv commercials! and will you look at this junk? this stuff is pure shit you tape it closed, it sags, you undo the tape: bingo the whole goddamn thing falls apart!}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(taking another diaper)}
<D>__{well, whaddya expect, if you pull on it like an ape, it's gonna rip!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{michael, will you give me a break, will you please?}
<A>__{peter takes the torn diaper off. mary utters a tiny cry and pees copiously all over the velvet couch.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(exploding)}
<D>__{oh shit! now she's pissing. look at the couch. the sneaky little bitch was just waiting for me to get the diaper off, then whammo...}
<A>__{mary gives them a big smile.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i happen to like my furniture. i'm going out to get some real diapers. you can clean the couch up in the meantime.}
<A>__{he exits, slamming the door.}
