<A>__{silence complete silence for the urbanite, though the oncoming darkness is punctuated by the sounds of farm country a few birds, a distant rumble of thunder from some heavy clouds on the horizon, a dog's barking. camera pans the green, squared off flatland, lit only by a fine sunset in its final throes. then, gradually, starting from nothing, a rumble is heard, quickly growing louder and louder until the sound of a train can be recognized. camera pans quickly, discovering the railroad line atop a man made rise of land, and the speeding passenger train is upon us, flashing by with a roar. then, as if from nowhere, the figure of a man hits the embankment and rolls crazily down to the bottom into the thick underbrush alongside the tracks. close shot body it lies in the bushes, still, unmoving dead. camera pans away to the quiet peaceful countryside as the sound of the train fades off until there is silence once more. title music begins with a crash.}
