<C>__{allison}
<D>__{sorry i thought you were going to stay under longer.}
<A>__{his face is clean shaven, a little shaving cream remains around his chin. he now has several electrodes attached to his cranium. they're connected to an eeg which beeps loudly. the noise bothers trevor. his eyes dart this way and that. he focuses on the bic razor.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{what's happening to me? what are you doing?}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{you came in for your eeg. you fell asleep and well, i took the liberty of...i'm sorry. you looked like a wreck trevor.}

<D>__{i just had the most vivid dream. i was sure i was dying.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{well you can relax now you are quite alive. and as long as you're awake, chin up.}
<A>__{trevor puts his chin up and allison continues shaving his neck. trevor studies her face.}
<C>__{allison }
<D>__{well? what do you say trevor? que pasa?}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(groggily)}
<D>__{let me see. oh yeah. my head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. i'm not sure if i'm dreaming or...}
<C>__{allison}
<P>__{(interupting) that `poor me' attitude doesn't suit}
<D>__{you trevor. listen, i don't mean to sound like pollyanna but things could be worse. there's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time.}
<A>__{you might see things a litlle differently from now}
<D>__{on.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{your insight is enlightening.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{no wisdom, no insight, no plan.}
<A>__{allison gives him a wink, disarming trevor.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{my wife said that exact same sentence to me the day we got married. she even winked too.}
<A>__{allison smiles and puts her hand on his.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{do you use this wife thing to hit on all the interns?}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{no... just you.}
<A>__{allison wipes his face clean with a towel.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{there. just like a baby's butt.}
<A>__{allison gets up, grabs a clipboard starts filling out a report. trevor stares at her.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{allison? why can't remember what happened to my wife? is it something i'm on that's... that's making me forget?}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{easy there trevor. you need to relax.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{no i need to remember. look whatever it is take me off it. i can handle pain. i can't handle not knowing...}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{you need to get better first trevor. way better.}

<D>__{it's okay to miss somebody. it's okay to still love someone after they're gone. but you've got to quit blaming yourself okay...? okay?}
<A>__{allison looks up and notices trevor's body has slackened, his eyes empty. she drops the clipboard and starts snapping her fingers over his eyes.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{trevor?}
<A>__{he is unconscious. a loud steady buzz sounds from one of the machines behind her as blood begins to leak out of trevor's ear. allison jumps up and hits call button above trevor's bed.}
<C>__{allison }
<D>__{code blue!}
<A>__{she yanks trevor's johnnie down, wheels a defribulator over to his dying body and grabs the paddles.}
<C>__{allison }
<D>__{it's okay trevor i'm coming for you.}
