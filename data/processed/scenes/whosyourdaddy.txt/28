<L>__{exterior "heaven" mansion swimming pool day}
<A>__{...coming out by another spectacular waterfall. which separates the indoor and outdoor pools. numerous beautiful women swim, chat, play water polo. some topless, some might as well be. the boys watch in awe as one woman rubs lotion on another woman's back.}

<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{good advice, ted. you have your father's instincts.}
<A>__{"his father." the words sound so strange. he never even met the guy.}
<C>__{uncle billy }
<D>__{just remember, you're not the man you were a day ago. and these girls, let's just say they'd be eager to please you.}
<A>__{ted gulps. it's hard to believe this is real.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?}
