<A>__{standing nearby but apart from them is renton. renton notes spud and tommy with their partners, and across the other side sick boy and begbie are engaged in flirtatious conversation with two women.}
<C>__{renton}
<P>__{(v.o)}
<D>__{the situation was becoming serious. young renton noticed the haste with which the successful, in the sexual sphere as in all others, egregated themselves from the failures.}
<A>__{begbie and sick boy with the two women. renton standing among a group of lone nerds. renton wades on to the dance floor, looking at countless women, all whom either turn away or are spoken for.}
<C>__{renton}
<P>__{(v.o)}
<D>__{heroin had robbed renton of his sex drive, but now it returned with a vengeance. and as the impotence of those days faded into memory, grim desperation took hold in his sex crazed mind. his post junk libido, fuelled by alcohol and amphetamine, taunted him remorselessly with his own unsatisfied desire dot.}
<A>__{renton notices one girl (diane) walking on her own towards the door. a man carrying two drinks catches up with her and walks backwards, talking to her. she says nothing. he blocks her way. she takes one drink and downs it, then the other, handing him back the empty glasses. she steps past him and walks on towards the door.}
<P>__{(v.o)}
<D>__{and with that, mark renton had fallen in love.}
