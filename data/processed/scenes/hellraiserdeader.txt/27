<L>__{interior amy's hotel room night}
<A>__{amy hangs up. she waits a moment, hesitates then takes the puzzle box from the table. she begins to explore it's edges with her fingers, rolling it over and over in her hands. it starts to unlock. she jumps as it begins to change shape, and sets it back on the table. light seems to emanate from within as it clicks into another form. the table beneath it seems tremble, the ice in her drink taps against the edge of the glass. figure appears in the darkness behind her. pinhead. here we go folks the phone rings. she nearly leaps out of the chair, striking the puzzle box with her hand. the puzzle box closes. pinhead vanishes back into the shadows.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{charles, i get the message. ok? your my editor, not my mommy!}
<P>__{(long beat)}
<D>__{charles?}
<A>__{amy waits. but there's no sound.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{hello? hello?}
<A>__{a sound comes over the line a hoarse gurgling sound a ghastly wet sound the same sound amy heard coming from the throat of the hanged marla.}
<C>__{marla}
<P>__{(through phone, wet choking voice)}
<D>__{don't open...}
<A>__{the line goes dead. she shoves the whole phone away from her. she sits, breathing fast for a second, staring at the box. quiet. only the sound of the snow on the tv. she stands and pulls her pants on.}
