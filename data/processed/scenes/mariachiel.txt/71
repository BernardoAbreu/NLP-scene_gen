<L>__{exterior street day}
<A>__{mariachi jumps onto another car and then down into the street. mean dudes exit the hotel and chase him on foot while a few get in the truck and chase him. the truck takes a short cut. mariachi is running through the sidewalks and streets in front os curioso shops, jumping small carts and children and cars to escape the two men behind him. he enters a small cutoff where the truck tries to stop him by heading off. the bad guys stick their heads and guns out of their windows and laugh as they ready to shoot him. mariachi, though, already having built momentum, runs right up the front of the trucks as the guys try to shoot him but not succeed in only shooting each other as he runs up and over the cab, into the bed, and onto the street. he swings his guitar case into another guy's groin and grabs is gun, reaiming it to shoot mean dude #5. mariachi shoots him in the arm, and mean dude #5 drops his gun and cowers away in pain. mariachi then turns the guy's gun on him and shoots him in the chest. mariachi grabs his case and as mean dude #5 turns to get s look at him, all he sees is the case coming into his face. mariachi heads back for domino's.}
