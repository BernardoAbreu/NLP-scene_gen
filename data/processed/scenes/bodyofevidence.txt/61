<L>__{interior courtroom later}
<A>__{the gallery is empty. only dulaney, rebecca, cardenas, troxell, roston, judge burnham, the jury and court officials remain.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{what did she do next, mr. roston?}
<C>__{roston}
<D>__{she started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. she reached down and put me inside her. my doctor had warned me about exerting myself but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that. you just think about how beautiful this woman is how much you want her. how deeply you want to please her.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{at first it started off slowly but the rhythm built and built. every time i got close to an orgasm she would stop. eventually i started to have trouble breathing. rebecca just kept going faster and faster. no matter what i said she wouldn't stop. i really thought for a moment i was going to die.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{if you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?}
<C>__{roston}
<D>__{i couldn't help myself. you get lost inside a women like her. it was like a drug. it was the best sex i ever had.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{what happened after that?}
<C>__{roston}
<D>__{i woke up the next morning and she was gone.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{did you change your will while you were with miss lawson?}
<C>__{roston}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{who was your primary beneficiary?}
<C>__{roston}
<D>__{she was.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{thank you. the state rests.}
<C>__{judge burnham}
<D>__{mister dulaney?}
<A>__{dulaney is stunned deep in thought. he doesn't appear to hear the question.}
<C>__{judge burnham}
<D>__{mister dulaney?}
<A>__{dulaney looks at the jury. what he sees isn't good. he thinks for a moment. he leans over and quickly speaks with rebecca. we cannot hear them but their conversation is heated. rebecca says something. dulaney looks at roston. a beat. dulaney stands.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{mr. roston, you said it was the best sex you ever had. is that the best sex with a woman, or a man?}
<A>__{cardenas bolts from his seat.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{objection!}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{i will rephrase the question. mr. roston isn't it true you are bisexual?}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{objection! mr. roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{your honor, i'm trying to establish the sense of betrayal miss lawson felt when she discovered the man she lived with was a different person than she thought he was.}
<A>__{judge burnham thinks for a moment.}
<C>__{judge burnham}
<D>__{the witness will answer the question.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{mr. roston?}
<C>__{roston}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{and your sexual tastes were something that you hid from miss lawson?}
<C>__{roston}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{and didn't miss lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover?}
<C>__{roston}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{and she left shortly after that?}
<A>__{a pause. roston thinks, struggling to make a decision.}
<C>__{roston}
<D>__{no. we worked things out. it was three weeks later when i told her about the heart surgery that she left.}
<A>__{roston looks around the court room. he is embarrassed, filled with emotion.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her?}
<C>__{roston}
<P>__{(very upset)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{no further questions.}
<A>__{roston looks at the jury their disapproving stares. he is on the verge of tears.}
