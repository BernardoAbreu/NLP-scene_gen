<L>__{interior wills' apartment continuous}
<A>__{charlotte steps into a dim hallway lined with oil paintings, carpeted with a persian runner, and lighted by three antique sconces. she walks slowly, terribly self conscious.}
<L>__{interior wills' living room continuous}
<A>__{the room is vast, furnished with antiques, decorated with the same masculine good taste. charlotte enters timidly, then hears }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{what happened?}
<A>__{she looks and sees wills standing, back turned, before a broad set of high windows. city lights glimmer in the distance; beneath them lies the vast gloom of central park.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{i couldn't get a cab, so i took the subway... only it was an express and it didn't stop at }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{you realize, don't you, that you're a full eighteen minutes late?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{i know... i'm so sorry... i }
<A>__{wills turns around. a magnificent figure expertly tailored tux, every hair in place, freshly manicured. and then he offers her an amused, reassuring smile }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{charlotte, relax. what's the point of being a beautiful young woman if it isn't to keep your admirers waiting? in fact, you disappoint me: i was looking forward to at least another half hour of suspense.}
<A>__{flattered, her face brightens }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{i could leave and come back.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{nope, too late. anyway, i want to see the hat.}
<A>__{he walks over to her. smiling, she sets down the box, unties the ribbon, and gingerly removes the hat. it's sublimely simple and elegant. she looks at him with hope. his face betrays nothing }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{try it on.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{i can't. i'm soaked.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{it's all right.}
<A>__{charlotte, a little confused, carefully sets the hat on her head. she steps to a wall mirror, pulls the veil down, and sets it at the correct angle. wills appears behind her and shares the reflection. she feels his presence, hears his breathing. they speak in hushed tones }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{it's perfect. it's like a tiny sculpture.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{i wanted it to be a tiny poem.}
<A>__{she smiles. their eyes meet in the glass.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{if only i had some use for it.}
<P>__{(off her look)}
<D>__{my date canceled a few hours ago.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i don't know. she was vague. would you... like to come in her place?}
<A>__{charlotte can't believe it. she smiles at his reflection.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{like this?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{the outfit i bought her is hanging in the guest room closet.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<P>__{(anxiously)}
<D>__{it's okay? are you sure?}
<C>__{wills}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{he gestures toward the half open door on other side of the room. charlotte turns and, biting her lip, looks at the door, then back at wills, then back at the door.}
