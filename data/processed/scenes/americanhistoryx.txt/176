<A>__{the two walk in and look at a curious and confused derek.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{what’s goin’ on?}
<C>__{rasmussen}
<D>__{we need to talk, derek.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{rasmussen}
<D>__{seth ryan and cammeron alexander are dead. they were shot to death outside ben’s burgers early this morning.}
<A>__{derek takes both hands and pulls back his hair. he sits down and thinks to himself for a few more seconds, frightened. familiar cops #3 and #4, now on call, walk in and sit down.}
<B>__{sweeney follows in last and derek stares at him.}
<C>__{derek}
<P>__{(to rasmussen)}
<D>__{any suspects?}
<C>__{rasmussen}
<D>__{possibly. big cam’s jaw was shattered and nine of his teeth were knocked out on the curb.}
<C>__{sweeney}
<D>__{sound familiar?}
<A>__{facing a vicious circle, derek takes his frustration out on a nearby chair. the owner barks at derek in korean. a confused derek eyes sweeney, who walks over to him. tight on sweeney and dered. derek sparks up a cigarette and stares over at rusmussen, danny, and the other officers.}
<C>__{sweeney}
<D>__{are they coming after you?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{fuckin’ a.}
<A>__{sweeney sighs to a concerned derek.}
<C>__{sweeney}
<D>__{i don’t think so. i think they feel justice has been served.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{maybe it has.}
<C>__{sweeney}
<D>__{but we can’t let this thing escalate.}
<P>__{(after a long beat)}
<D>__{will you talk to them?}
<A>__{derek looks over and analyzes the innocence of his brother. he then takes a long drag off his cigarette and nods.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{i’ll do whatever it takes.}
<C>__{sweeney}
<D>__{okay. good.}
<A>__{sweeney walks away and then turns back to derek.}
<C>__{sweeney}
<D>__{watch your back.}
<A>__{derek says nothing. sweeney exits with rasmussen.}
<C>__{sweeney}
<P>__{(back to danny)}
<D>__{you’re showing up today, right?}
<A>__{danny looks at sweeney and nods his head yes.}
