<DIAL>__{I like my privacy.}
<CHAR>__{DONKEY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You've trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence.}

He looks up and spots that the chandelier is right above the dragons head.

Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto her head, but it's too big and it goes over her head and forms a sort of collar for her. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey take off running. Very 'Matrix' style. Shrek grabs Donkey and then grabs Princess Fiona as he runs past her.}
