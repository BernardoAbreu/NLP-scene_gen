<A>__{close on the iron security grating as it fits over a glass skylight. above, masked workers weld it on. sparks fly. grant stares up at it, thinking. footsteps echo behind him as regis, ellie, gennaro, and nedry look around the unfinished building. the visitor's center is two stories high, a lot of glass with exposed girders and supports. it's incomplete: vines swing in the breeze where the back wall will go and undressed cables litter the floor. even so, exhibit areas are in varying stages of completion. behind, several spanish workers unpack masonry supplies.}

<D>__{where's hammond?}
<C>__{regis}

<C>__{gennaro}
<D>__{hot, hot, hot. ten billion bucks and the air conditioning sucks.}
<A>__{regis smiles apologetically and pushes open a large window on one of the finished walls. giant leaves and vines burst inside. grant studies an exhibit in progress entitled when dinosaurs rules the world. this is a large clock that presents millions of years as hours in a single day. many brightly colored hours are allocated to the dinosaurs. man receives the last second of the day. ellie joins grant.}

<A>__{grant smiles at her inexhaustible enthusiasm. he looks at a painted mural of a raptor on one of the walls in the half completed gift shop. nedry is at a coke machine, feeding in change . it doesn't work. he slams his hand against it, and finally, a cup drops down the chute. upside down. it pours. coke splashes nedry. he curses and exits. the rotunda ellie pulls grant over to a raised, round display with a catwalk. in this unfinished display, a skeletal t rex and a raptor are locked in combat. scaffolding is up around it, and painting supplies are scattered all around. regis glances at his watch, looks up, and smiles. at that moment, doors adjacent to the rotunda swing open automatically. a soothing female voice comes out of the public address system.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{please come to the theater. in a moment, our film will begin.}
<A>__{the voice goes on to give this information in a number of languages. regis waves everyone into the theater. nedry doesn't join them. he climbs the stairs to the second floor.}
