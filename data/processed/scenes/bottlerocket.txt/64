<L>__{interior motel room. night}
<A>__{dignan's sitting in bed, watching tv. he's got a fat lip and a big bruise over his eye. anthony's sitting in a chair beside him. inez brings over a glass of water and some ice in a washcloth. she gives the ice to dignan for his eye. she puts the glass of water on the nightstand where there's some fast food layed out for dignan: burger, fries, an apple pie. inez goes into the bathroom, closes the door, and turns on the water. anthony's sitting there with his hands clasped, not looking at the tv.}
