<C>__{mike}
<D>__{what if they don't know. if she's adrift, if they're asleep, she could run aground. she could break up on the reef.}
<C>__{phil}
<P>__{(to robin)}
<D>__{maybe you didn't check it good enough.}
<C>__{robin}

<D>__{relax everybody. everything is under control. the jug head's going to think of something.}
<A>__{without warning. john lunges at phil. phil screams, trying to defend himself. the guys all dive in. suddenly it's an all out brawl. john out of control pounding phil's head against the seat of the boat. suddenly, from behind, comes a blistering "thwack!!" as chuck breaks an oar over the back of john's head. stunned, john lets go of phil and turns, blood dripping from the back of his head.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{nobody calls me an idiot.}
<A>__{he weaves, then passes out, falling face down in the sand. the guys stagger to their feet, trying to recover.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{god damn it man. i think he broke my nose!}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{shut up, phil.}
<A>__{chuck tosses the broken oar handle, kneels over and vomits.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{well that's just great. now what are we supposed to do?}
<A>__{chuck and robin hoist john up and drag him under a palm tree, propping him up. the others huddle to stay warm.}
