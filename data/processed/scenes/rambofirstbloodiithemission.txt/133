<D>__{it's those russian interrogators again.}
<A>__{everyone looks grim.}
<L>__{interior interrogation room}
<A>__{vinh sends the gawking guards scurrying with strident yells as he follows the two russians into the room. the soviets stand in front of rambo. the shorter of the two, lieutenant commander yati podovsk, has the slight build and unremarkable features of a bank clerk, though for a man in his forties he is in superb condition. the other, lieutenant palyushin, is another story. he is a tall broad slab of combat muscle, his black hair cut short as a scrub brush. thick and functional as state sculpture, his features cannot fill his broad, flat face. both wear the khaki field dress and black beret of the naval spetznatz brigada, the "special operations brigada". at palyushin's feet, rambo finds himself looking up at his soviet opposite number, the black beret.}

<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{put him in the chair.}
<A>__{palyushin hauls rambo onto a wooden stool against the wall. podovsk sits next to him on a small metal desk. it is almost dark and the only light is from a single bare bulb.}

<P>__{(viet to vinh)}
<D>__{thank you, captain vinh. leave one guard, please.}
<A>__{vinh exits with tay and the other three viets. podovsk adjusts his wire rim glasses and considers rambo. he turns rambo's bloodied face gently, examining the injuries.}
<C>__{podovsk}
<D>__{these people are so... vulgar in their approach. i am lieutenant commander podovsk. i do not know who you are. will you tell me?}
<A>__{podovsk's english is lightly accented but clear and articulate. he has a nasal condition, however. rambo doesn't answer.}
<C>__{podovsk}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{no? not even your name?}
<P>__{(silence)}
<D>__{this is a poor beginning for an intimate relationship. by tomorrow or the next day you will tell me things you would not tell a lover.}
<A>__{podovsk notices the long criss crossed scars on rambo's chest and back.}
<C>__{podovsk}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i see you are no stranger to pain. then of course you must know how senseless it is to resist in the long run. is it possible you have been among my vietnamese comrades before?}
<A>__{podovsk catches something as rambo breaks his gaze, looking away.}
<C>__{podovsk}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{yes. i think that must be it. where were you held? hanoi? son tay? i apologize. i'm getting ahead. sometimes i get too eager. my comrade and i, in our capacity as advisors, have been sent from our center at cam ranh bay to discover from you certain things... for example: whether you are working directly for the american government... who your contacts were... and on and on. quite a list. will you tell me these things now?}
<A>__{rambo gazes at a point in space.}
<C>__{podovsk}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{of course you won't. but, as a moral man, i felt compelled to ask.}
<A>__{he stands with a shrug of finality and gestures to his massive assistant.}
<C>__{podovsk}
<D>__{this is lieutenant palyushin. to him you are a piece of meat.}
<P>__{(in russian to palyushin)}
<D>__{proceed.}
