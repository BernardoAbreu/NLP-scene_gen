<L>__{exterior stockholm day}
<A>__{an unexciting social welfare building.}
<L>__{interior bjurman's office day}
<A>__{as a man behind a desk reviews a thick file, salander reviews him: about 50; spends money on suits, thinking that might disguise his public servant status; no wedding ring; typical creep, as far as she's concerned.}
<C>__{bjurman}
<D>__{how's mr. palmgren doing? i was told he had a stroke of some kind.}
<P>__{(nothing from salander)}
<D>__{terrible.}
<A>__{it is, but she can tell he couldn't care less. he leafs through her file }
<C>__{bjurman}
<D>__{what exactly do you do at this security company?}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{make coffee and sort mail.}
<C>__{bjurman}
<D>__{but not full time. not even part time consistently. they somehow got along without coffee or mail in july and august?}
<A>__{nothing from her.}
<C>__{bjurman}
<D>__{how much do you earn there?}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{enough.}
<C>__{bjurman}
<D>__{how much is your rent?}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{i pay my rent.}
<C>__{bjurman}
<D>__{when's the last time you were late?}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{never.}
<C>__{bjurman}
<D>__{do you think that ring in your eyelid makes you attractive?}
<A>__{salander, who's had to suffer insufferable officials all her life, doesn't dignify the question with an answer.}
<C>__{bjurman}
<D>__{here's the problem. there a discrepancy between the obligation of mr. palmgren's guardianship and the management of your finances.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{it isn't a discrepancy or a problem. it was clear to him i could manage my own finances.}
<C>__{bjurman}
<D>__{but that's not clear to me.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{i'm not a child.}
<C>__{bjurman}
<D>__{no. you're not.}
<P>__{(looks at her too long)}
<D>__{but you were. and between then and now }
<P>__{(indicating the files)}
<D>__{ two years in the locked ward at st. stephens, for violent aggression failure to adapt to four foster homes and seven schools arrested twice for intoxication, twice for narcotics use, and most recently for assault: a bottle smashed into a man's face. you may have conned mr. palmgren into thinking you've improved, but looking at this }
<P>__{(the file)}
<D>__{ not to mention how you're looking at me now i can see you haven't. so the good old mr palmgren days are over. starting now, you'll be given a monthly allowance. you'll provide me with receipts for your expenses.}
<C>__{bjurman }
<D>__{if the numbers don't balance, i will have to assume the difference is going to drugs.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{i've been on my own since i was twelve.}
<C>__{bjurman}
<D>__{no. you've been a persistent burden to the state since you were twelve.}
<A>__{she won't look at him any more not that there's anything even remotely interesting to see if she did.}
<C>__{bjurman }
<D>__{ms. salander? please look at me. because this is important.}
<A>__{she does ... in a way that says, i'd like to kill you.}
<C>__{bjurman}
<D>__{this behavior you're displaying right now is elaborately documented here }
<P>__{(in the file)}
<D>__{ so it would come as a shock to no one if i chose an alternative to the lenient arrangement i just outlined. is that what you're saying with your silence? you'd prefer institutionalization?}
