<L>__{interior morgue examining room day}
<A>__{retired detective hank flannigan runs the high tech morgue where the bodies are stacked on trays like bakery buns. flannigan, a trim, bespectacled mr. clean, clicks his false teeth between thoughts. the body on the exotic lab table is the gunman eddie shot during the raid. eddie is here to confirm the identification. his new partner, kosalas, is with him, very uncomfortable in this setting.}
