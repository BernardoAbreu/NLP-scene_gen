<A>__{it's a bleak, windy morning, the kind that clears the streets of all but the winos (who carry their own heaters), and the point men for juvenile gangs. we pick up a solitary figure, joe mottola, coming down the street and entering what appears to be an abandoned tenement. he pauses a second to dust his white winged alligator shoes on the back of his pants leg. sharply dressed and surrounded by the aura of one who is making money for the first time and broadcasting it on all bands, he seems an incongruity in this part of town. we follow him up a flight of rickety stairs to a second floor flat. he knocks on the door, is admitted by a cautious doorman.}
<L>__{interior numbers spot day}
<A>__{suddenly we are plunged into a room of chattering, clamoring people. this is a spot for the numbers racket, a place immune from legal interference, where any sucker can bet on a number between 1 and 1000 in the hope of getting the 600 to 1 payoff that goes to those few who guess right. the bettors are queued up in several lines before a long table, where they place their bets and are given receipts in return. others wait at a cashier's window to pick up previous earnings or to ask for credit. mottola moves through the crowd to a back room where betting slips are being sorted and money counted under the watchful and somewhat impatient gaze of a supervisor, an older man named mr. granger. the yankee white sox game is heard on the radio in the background. mottola, noticing that his entrance has aroused little interest, saunters over to the phone girl and gives her a little pinch on the cheek. the girl slaps his hand away, obviously having been through this before.}

<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{spin it anyway, jimmy.}
<A>__{jimmy is beside himself. if he doesn't spin again, hooker may expose him. if he does spin, and loses, his management will fire him. he pleads to hooker with his eyes, but it's no use. jimmy spins the wheel and reluctantly drops in the ball. this time there is no foot on the lever, and it settles into black 15. hooker stares at the ball a second and then looks up at his terrified friend.}
