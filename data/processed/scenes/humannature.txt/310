<A>__{lila runs to nathan. she kneels beside him.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{he's dead.}
<C>__{puff}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{we bury the body. we disappear into the woods. nobody knows.}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(beat, then quietly)}
<D>__{no. this is the end of the road. there's a dead human being here. for all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.}
<C>__{puff}
<D>__{forget him, lila. we'll disappear. we'll never talk about it again. we'll never talk again period. i love you.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as nathan's. maybe more so, because i knew it was wrong and i went along with it anyway. i'm taking responsibility for the murder. i want you to go back to your old life.}
<C>__{puff}
<D>__{i won't let you do that. i shot the bastard. and i'm glad.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{no. go back to the woods. this is a sacrifice i need to make. in my world we have something called penance. it's another abstraction, but i had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. it doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. see, i could never be free again anyway, so i might as well be in jail.}
<C>__{puff}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{then i will live for both of us, lila. i will be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. for both of us.}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(tearing up)}
<D>__{that's what i'm counting on.}
<C>__{puff}
<P>__{(an idea)}
<D>__{but first i will live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{okay. if you think it will help.}
