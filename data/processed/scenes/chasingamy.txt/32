<L>__{ext street day}
<A>__{banky sits on a curb, staring into the distance, holden saunters up and sits beside him. he follows banky's gaze.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{catholic school girls.}
<A>__{across the street, the catholic high school is letting out. teenage girls clad in uniforms and tight sweaters smoke, frolic, wait for their bus.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{the uniform is what does it for me. i wish i'd have went with more catholic school girls when i was a kid. as it stands. i have no "...and then she unzipped her jumper..." stories.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{you looked weirded out back there.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{that's my couch you were fucking on.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{i wanted to watch some tv. hard to do when your best friend's wrapped around a naked rug muncher on your couch.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{she had boxers on.}
<A>__{banky shoots him a glare. he goes back to staring at the oc girls.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{this is all going to end badly.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{you don't know that.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{i know you. you're way too conservative for that girl. she's been around and seen things we've only read about in books.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{but we have read about them. so we're prepared.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{there's no 'we' here. you're going to have to go through this alone. and it's one thing to read about shit, and something different when you're forced to deal with it on a regular basis. when you guys are walking in the mall and both your heads turn at a really nice looking chick, it's going to eat you up inside. you'll spend most of your time wondering when the other shoe's going to drop. because for you, this isn't about cool weird sex stuff, it's about love.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{maybe it is for her as well.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{somehow i doubt it.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{everyone's not out to get someone in life. bank.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{everybody has an agenda. everyone.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{yourself?}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{my agenda is to watch your back.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{to what end?}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{to insure that all this time we've spent together, building something, wasn't wasted.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{she's not going to ruin the comic.}
<C>__{banky}
<D>__{i wasn't talking about the comic.}
<P>__{(gets up)}
<D>__{i'm going to gel a bagel. clean off my fucking couch so i can watch tv.}
<A>__{banky walks away. holden shakes his head.}
