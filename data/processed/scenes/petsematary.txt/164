<C>__{louis }
<D>__{that was a mistake. but rachel... she doesn't like to talk about death, or even think of it. her younger sister died of spinal meningitis when rachel was eight. rachel was there when it happened. alone. i guess you could say it made a complex.}

<D>__{cat's just as dead, louis.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{well that's a big help! (pause) i'm sorry, jud.}
<C>__{jud}
<D>__{no need to apologize.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{maybe when they call i will just tell ellie i haven't seen the damn cat around. you know?}
<C>__{jud }
<D>__{maybe there's a better way.}
