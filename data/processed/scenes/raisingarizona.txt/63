<B>__{the headboard}
<A>__{of the unpainted crib with the burned in names: harry, barry, larry, garry, and nathan jr. as we pull back from the headboard ed's arms are gently depositing the sleeping nathan jr. into the crib. hi puts the singed copy of dr. spock's baby and child care next to the baby.}
<B>__{reverse}
<A>__{hi and ed looking sadly down at the baby. the silence is broken by the bleat of a squeeze me toy as the lights are snapped on. hi and ed turn, startled.}

<A>__{nathan stands in his jammies, hair disheveled, holding a gun and squinting against the light. keeping the gun trained on hi and ed, he slowly raises a pair of eyeglasses to his nose.}

<D>__{the hell is goin' on?}
<A>__{he advances cautiously into the nursery, gesturing with his gun.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{...get away from there.}
<A>__{hi and ed back away from the crib. nathan peers in and studies the baby for a moment. he lays the gun down, tenderly picks up the baby and holds him to his chest. a tear forms at the corner of his eye. hi and ed are quietly moving back towards the ladder.}

<D>__{well, sir, in a re ward situation, they usually say no questions asked.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{do they.}
<A>__{hi shrugs. nathan turns to put the baby back in the crib.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{...all right, boy, i guess you got a re ward coming. twenty thousand dollars...}
<A>__{he turns around with a thought:}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{...or, if you need home furnishings, i can give you a fine of credit at any of my stores. fact, that's the way i'd rather handle it, for tax reasons...}
<C>__{hi}

<C>__{ed}
<D>__{we don't want no reward.}
<A>__{hi does a small take, surprised at this much integrity.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{...we didn't bring him back for money.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{well, we could work it that way too.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{could i just look at him a little bit more?}
<A>__{she stands looking into the crib. hi steps up next to her and puts an arm around her shoulder.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{be my guest, young lady... but would you mind tellin' me exactly how you }
<A>__{ed starts crying softly as she gazes into the crib. hi murmurs something to comfort her. nathan is studying the two of them.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{...you took him, didn't you? wasn't that biker a'tal.}
<A>__{hi turns to face him. he speaks in a rush.}

<C>__{ed}
<P>__{(still crying)}
<D>__{we both did it. we didn't wanna hurt him any; i just wanted to be a mama.}
<C>__{hi}
<D>__{it wasn't for money or nothin'. we just figured you had more'n you could handle, babywise. but i'm the one committed the actual crime sir, if you need to call the authorities }
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{shutup boy, no one's callin' the authorities if there's no harm done.}
<C>__{hi}
<D>__{thank you sir.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{thank you sir.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{aw bullshit. just tell me just tell me why you did it.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{we can't have our own.}
<A>__{nathan looks at her. finally he nods and sighs.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{...well lookit. if you can't have kids you gotta just keep tryin' and hope medical science catches up with you. like florence'n me it caught up with a vengeance. and hell, even if it never does, you still got each other.}
<C>__{hi}
<D>__{sir, those're kind words. but i think the wife and me are splittin' up...}
<A>__{he indicates ed with a nod of the head.}
<C>__{hi}
<D>__{...her point of view is we're both kinda selfish and unrealistic, so we ain't too good for each other.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{well ma'am, i don't know much but i do know human bein's. you brought back my boy so you must have your good points too. i'd sure hate to think of florence leavin' me i do love her so...}
<A>__{he clears his throat and turns to the door. his tone is harder again:}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{...you can go out the way you came in...}
<A>__{he snaps off the lights.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{...and before you go off and do another foolish thing, like busting up, i suggest you sleep on it...}
<A>__{he has disappeared into the hall. we hear his voice receding:}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{...at least one night.}
<B>__{high shot}
<A>__{looking straight down at hi, asleep in the trailer bedroom. we start to crane down.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{that night i had a dream...}
