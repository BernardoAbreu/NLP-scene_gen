<L>__{interior cloak room capitol bldg. day}
<A>__{towering doors swing open. dehaven appears, face pleasant but harried.}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{jordan. i always hoped we'd get together though just now i'm gearing up for a child care vote that }
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{lieutenant thomas wickwire.}
<A>__{about to hug jordan, dehaven stops awkwardly.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{you know him.}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{sounds familiar.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{it should. you nominated him for spec recon just three days after you nominated me.}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{jordan. might we do this over lunch tomorrow? i do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely }
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{did you set me up? did you set me up just to see me fail?}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{absolutely not.}
<A>__{dehaven glances back at the doors to the senate chamber the open doors. walking jordan a few steps away:}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{wickwire was there to help. to be my eyes on the inside, to make sure you were getting a fair shot. at least that was the intent.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{what changed?}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{should probably ask him that.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{if i have to ask again, senator, i will be asking in front of cameras.}
<A>__{it's a threat dehaven doesn't appreciate. the senate doorkeeper appears.}
<C>__{doorkeeper}
<D>__{madam senator? your esteemed colleagues are requesting }
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{two seconds, walter.}
<P>__{(answering jordan)}
<D>__{in 1981, the supreme court was asked to rule on the issue of women in combat positions. the court cited the 1948 combat exclusion laws as a legal foundation for keeping women ineligible. that decision held for all these years until the white house, 10 days ago, moved to have the exclusion laws voided. to demolish that legal foundation.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{so? isn't the president jumping on your bandwagon?}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{what he did was light the bandwagon on fire. because he knows what i know that american families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{you don't know that.}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{in face, i do: roper, harris, gallop they all come back the same.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{what are you saying? that a women's life is more valuable than a man's? that a women's death hurts a family more?}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{i'm saying it's not going to happen. not when the president is set to turn this into a third rail issue should i choose to ever campaign against him. he will fry me six ways to sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.}
<A>__{jordan shakes her head in disbelief. she has met the enemy and she is us.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{you were never going to let women serve in combat. you always had a safety net. or thought you did.}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{jordan. i don't expect you to fully understand this but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{so the rhetoric gets you headlines. but the reality gets you in trouble.}
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{the reality is this: we send far too many men off to war. i don't need to compound the problem with women.}
<P>__{(off jordan's look)}
<D>__{can you honestly tell me you wanted that life? squat pissing in some third world jungle with }
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{i wanted the choice. the chance to prove myself, my skills, my work, me. that's how it should've been.}
<C>__{doorkeeper}
<D>__{madam senator, once again i must }
<C>__{dehaven}
<D>__{just hold the goddamn clock, walter.}
<A>__{not happy about it, the doorkeeper reaches into an alcove, grabs a broom he keeps around for just these occasions. he enters the chamber...}
