<L>__{interior casino night}
<A>__{the roulette table. the ball is bouncing in and out of numbers.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no more bets.}
<A>__{the middle aged man closes his eyes. the woman puts her hand on the young man's arm.}
<C>__{jack's voice}
<D>__{next stage. he had to be secure at 8 to 1 against having to give the money back, so he wouldn't spend it. if after one month no one had approached him, he calculated the odds of keeping it at 20 to 1. after three months he figured 100 to 1 no one would turn up.}
<A>__{the ball bounces into 21. the woman gives a cry of joy. she grips the young man's hand. he leans over to her, eyeing her diamond necklace, and whispers something seductive in her ear. she stiffens with apprehensive pleasure. the middle aged man opens his eyes, there is a look of misery on his face. jack sweeps away the lost chips, pays out five minor winners. he calmly counts a small pile of chips and slides them to the middle aged man by sleight of hand. then he prepares to pay out the woman. no one has noticed the pay out to the middle aged man. the man looks at jack incredulously. jack smiles mechanically. the man mouths the words 'thank you' to jack. the woman looks up at the young man. she gives him a pile of chips. he gives them back. he kisses her neck.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{how about a drink to celebrate?}
<A>__{the middle aged man stands up, his face creased in emotion, relief.}
<C>__{man}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<D>__{cash me in.}
<A>__{jack converts the green coloured chips to 35 in house chips. the man nods at jack, who smiles formally. the man leaves the table. punters place their bets for the next spin. jack sees the man stop by the next roulette table.}
<C>__{jack's voice}
<D>__{jake's experiment with the man would prove the pointerior}
<A>__{the man hesitates. he can't resist. in close up: the man puts two of the chips down.}
<C>__{jack's voice}
<D>__{people don't change.}
