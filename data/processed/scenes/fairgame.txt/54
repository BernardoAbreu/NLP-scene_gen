<L>__{interior cia mess hall, 2nd floor, langley. day}
<A>__{valerie and mike queue up in the mess with jim pavitt, 52 the deputy director of the cia.}
<C>__{pavitt}
<D>__{relax mike. the veep's just dotting the i's.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{bullshit jim. the only time a vice president comes to langley is to cut a fucking ribbon.}
<C>__{pavitt}
<D>__{look. cheney doesn't trust us. this shit with dick goes back thirty years. it'll blow over.}
<P>__{(he turns to valerie)}
<D>__{where are we on iraq?}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{behind the curve sir. most of the intel is outdated. we don't have a single operative or asset in the country.}
<C>__{pavitt}
<D>__{what about geo satellite imaging?}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{with respect sir, you can't look at this problem from space and make a call.}
<C>__{pavitt}
<D>__{so talk to the defectors.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{the defectors are unreliable. most are supplied through a former asset the agency's had on a burn notice since `95. it's a racket. they walk in and get paid to say whatever the pentagon wants to hear.}
<C>__{pavitt}
<D>__{so we're blind.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{we need sources we can rely on. we need to get in close.}
<C>__{pavitt}
<D>__{how close?}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{inside.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{jim. val thinks she can get us inside the weapons program.}
<A>__{pavitt looks at her.}
<C>__{pavitt}
<D>__{how?}
