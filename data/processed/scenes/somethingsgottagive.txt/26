<C>__{julian}
<D>__{you know what freud said there are no accidents.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{trust me. this was an accident. although, why would she be walking around naked when she knows i'm 20 feet away.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{why would you think her bedroom was the kitchen?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{it was dark, it was two in the morning.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{that could explain why she was walking around naked. deep breath...}
