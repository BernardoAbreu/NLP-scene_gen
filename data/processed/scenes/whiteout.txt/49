<A>__{carrie jumps into the whiteout, catching the red storm line and clipping in as she staggers forward. glancing back, she sees the killer in the doorway, then loses sight of him as she's swallowed in the whiteout. she struggles down the line, buffeted by the storm, but her hand on the line moves erratically he's on. she swivels a nervous whirl to see the killer materializing out of the whiteout right behind her. he's clipped into carrie's line. he raises the axe. he swings. she jumps back, losing her footing. hits the ice hard face first. the killer towers over her, raising the axe again. carrie drives her heel into his knee, knocking him off balance. he drops next to her. he reaches for carrie, grabbing her mask, pulling it off. she cries out as the freezing wind catches her face. the killer gets to his feet and delivers a rib cracking kick, flipping carrie onto her back. sound fades from carrie's world. there is nothing but her strained breathing. the killer draws back the axe, shiny with frozen blood. he swings. carrie unclips her harness from the tether. the wind grabs her, and carrie slides away the killer disappearing from view behind the swirling wall of white. sliding across the ice, carrie slams into a pole. grabs on.}
