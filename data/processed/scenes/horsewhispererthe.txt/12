<L>__{exterior dyer horse farm morning}
<A>__{the snow has stopped falling. grace walks along a hill, hands in pocket. spread out on the landscape are horses, on a horse farm, standing like statues in the white covered fields. as grace comes along the hill, we see another girl (judith) coming from the opposite direction. she doesn't have grace's lean elegance but her warm, friendly smile brightens her face. upon reaching her, grace returns the smile with a hug.}
<C>__{judith}
<D>__{it's warmer than i thought.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you want to go to a movie tonight?}
<C>__{judith}
<D>__{i thought your mom's coming up?}
<C>__{grace}
<P>__{(prickly)}
<D>__{so?}
<A>__{judith immediately senses a problem so she continues casually, as they begin walking away from camera...}
<C>__{judith}
<D>__{my parents are having friends from college over. they're really nice... they have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{can i come? i will start a fire...}
<A>__{judith laughs as they continue talking, their voices trailing off, as the girls head for the stables.}
