<C>__{baltus}
<D>__{hurry along. the meeting has most certainly already begun. we do not want steenwyck as our enemy.}
<A>__{lady van tassel trails. wood is heard splintering... just off the road, a tree falls... the trunk catches lady van tassel's horse on its rear flank. the horse falls. lady van tassel hits the dirt. baltus looks back, halting. lady van tassel looks up to baltus in fear, then turns. behind her, the headless horseman trots from, the forest on daredevil, stops. calm. he takes his axe in hand.}
