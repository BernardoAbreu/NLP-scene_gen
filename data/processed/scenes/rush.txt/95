<A>__{a jumbo jet roars down the runway and takes off...}
<L>__{exterior manhattan day}
<A>__{the unmistakable skyline. among the ten thousand craggy rooftops and skyscrapers... a grand, five star hotel overlooking central park in manhattan's mid town district...}
<L>__{exterior hotel manhattan day}
<A>__{a huge collection of paparazzi snappers and journalist hacks is camped outside the hotel. immediately a surge of activity, "here he is"... a burst of flashlights and a volley of questions from the journalists as james gets out of the taxi and runs the gauntlet of humiliation... ...into the hotel..}
<L>__{interior hotel suite day}
<A>__{a large hotel suite. there are flowers everywhere. newspapers are all over the table. james sits opposite suzy. he sees an expensive gift; recently opened. a diamond necklace..}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{that from him?}
<A>__{suzy nods. even the uninitiated eye can tell: it's worth a fortune.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{why have you come here, james?}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{to get you back.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{you don't want me back...you never wanted to be married in the first place. you did it because you hoped it might change you...settle you down... help with the racing. not because you loved me. and who knows, if it had been just the drinking, or the dope, or the infidelity, or the moods...it might even have worked...but when it's all of them?}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{i know. i'm terrible.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{no, you're not terrible. you're just...who you are...at this point in your life. and god help anyone that wants more.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{will he be able to give you more? he has quite the bad boy reputation himself.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{what's important is how it feels to me. and it feels like he adores me.}
<A>__{a flicker behind james's eyes. failure.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{he's aware of the delicacy of the situation, and how it looks. having raided your larder. plundered your safe. smash and grab, and so forth. so he's assured me he'll take care of the financial side. and will be very generous.}
<A>__{james manages a brave smile.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{fine. i will give him a call.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{no. his lawyers will contact you.}
<A>__{james notices the vast unmade bed. where, until recently, two people had slept.}
