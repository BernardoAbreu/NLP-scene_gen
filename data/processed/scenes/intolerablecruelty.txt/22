<A>__{marylin sits in the den. she's had some coffee and, although teary and disheveled, is no longer psychotic.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{i just cried when i got home. somehow, your disdain for me i'm pretty tough miles, but i'm human. all my life people have been ascribing these terrible motives to me. i used to think they were jealous, or they didn't understand, but... i dunno. maybe others see something in me. something i'm not even aware of. anyway, thank you for letting me come here. i guess i was a little drunk.}
<A>__{she takes the coffee cup and has a sip. she looks like a lost waif.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{you have a very nice home, miles. very inviting.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{you have wonderful art. i love that lithograph. hockney?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{yes. i just got that, actually. it was a gift.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{from a girlfriend.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{no. no. i don't have a... no. it was from a client.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{no kidding. i will bet you have some very grateful clients. what'd rex buy you?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{rex sent me two humidors full of pre castro cubans.}
<A>__{marylin looks at a photograph miles has on a side table.}
<B>__{a woman and two small boys.}
<A>__{the woman has her arm around one of them. the other stands close to her. smiling, but awkward and tentative.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{is that you?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{me. yes.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{oh. and that is mom?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{yeah. mom. mom and brother.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{you look like you were a very sensitive child. you have expressive eyes.}
<A>__{miles walks over to look at the picture.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{hmmm...}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{and your mother was very beautiful. she must be proud of you.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{she never particularly cared for me.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{she didn't love you?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{no. she loved me. she would never not love her son. she just didn't... i wasn't her "type." she said i was a very, colicky baby. you know? difficult. not a good sleeper? didn't eat well? we got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup }
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{she held that against you?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{apparently she was very disappointed.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{boy. boy, oh boy.}
<A>__{marylin looks at the picture again. and yes you can see how hesitant miles was. marylin is moved. a flash of something genuine crosses her face.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{and here i thought my mother was...}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{your mother was.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{oh right. you met patricia.}
<A>__{she takes a sip of coffee. regards miles.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{we're damaged goods.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{no, we're not!}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{we are, miles. you know i'm right. there's something "off" about you and me miles. and maybe it isn't because of these women maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. maybe...}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{that is bullshit! mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. i can't believe you're saying this, marylin! there's nothing wrong with us. we're attractive and charismatic and successful and... i like us.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{i'm sorry miles. you shouldn't listen to me. i'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. i'd better go. i'm depressing.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{thank you for the coffee. it's very robust.}
<A>__{she stands. picks up her purse. walks over to him with an outstretched hand.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{friends?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{don't go. stay with me for a while.}
<A>__{he doesn't release her hand. instead he draws her to him, and kisses her. she kisses him. he kisses her back. she...}
