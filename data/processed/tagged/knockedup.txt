<C>__{dr. kuni}
<D>__{alison, i apologize for being a little brash, but if you're okay with it, it's rather important we break the bag and give you some medicine to speed things up. because once the bag is broken, i don't want there to be an infection.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{whatever. do what you have to do.}
<A>__{dr. kuni exits.}
