<L>__{interior the shuttle}
<A>__{everyone is in a jumbled tangle ultra magnus beneath blurr, perceptor upside down and hanging from torn end of stairway, arcee crouched over daniel and springer with half his body sticking through the hull}
<C>__{springer}
<P>__{(pulling himself free of hull wall)}
<D>__{remind me to give the auto pilot a raise... daniel creeps out from under arcee and shakes bits of broken metal and dust off his shoulders}
<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{wow! that was better'n the roller coaster at future world!}
<C>__{perceptor}
<P>__{(working scanner, computer device, thoughtfully)}
<D>__{the composition of this planet seems to be a chaotic amalgam of discarded ferrous and non ferrous articulations.}
<C>__{ultra magnus}
<P>__{(baffled)}
<D>__{how's that?}
<C>__{springer}
<P>__{(opening hull door with a ripping of metal)}
<D>__{he says the planet's made of junk.}
<B>__{springer and perceptor at open door}
<A>__{as they look out on landscape of "living" junk}
<C>__{springer}
<D>__{yep, this dump is a dump......}
<C>__{ultra magnus}
<D>__{as he straps on tool belt}
<C>__{ultra magnus}
<D>__{we might be able to salvage this thing.}
<P>__{(checks laser drill, turns it on, off)}
<D>__{ultra magnus starts for door followed by blurr who takes up a saw and tool belt and perceptor who rolls up shuttle plans as daniel moves out to join them}
<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{can i help, too?}
<C>__{springer}
<D>__{it's rough out there, kid. stay inside and play with crayons or something.}
<C>__{arcee}
<D>__{as she steps forward with a smile, a strange grid like "suit" in her hand}
<C>__{arcee}
<D>__{i think daniel can make himself useful with....this! it used to be spike's.}
<P>__{(holds grid like metal frame "suit")}
<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{wow! dad's exo suit. he told me about it but i never saw it.}
<C>__{arcee}
<D>__{here, try it on.}
<A>__{she starts helping him into the exo suit.}
<B>__{on daniel}
<A>__{as he gets inside the "suit" which fits over his body like a grid work metal "cage." daniel clips "cage" of exo suit shut and stands up inside the gridwork which makes him taller and broader. he moves awkwardly, barely able to advance a step}
<C>__{springer}
<D>__{just think about what you want to do before you do it!}
<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{brows knitted, thinking.}
<C>__{springer}
<D>__{don't fight it dan o.}
<A>__{he suddenly starts moving rapidly backwards, then sideways, then forward, then he starts dancing rapidly, then bounces off walls... ..spinning upside down, then flips over several times and lands in a splatter, legs spread, arms this way and that amused, startled and unhurt.}
<C>__{daniel}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{it's kind of tricky....}
<A>__{he suddenly flips around twice in mid air then regains his feet and leans way over against arcee for support. she laughs and pats his shoulder}
<C>__{arcee}
<D>__{for the first time out, you were great!}
<B>__{on springer at door}
<A>__{as he sends down ramp and motions to the others curtly}
<C>__{springer}
<D>__{show time's over! we've got work to do!}
<P>__{(he starts out)}
