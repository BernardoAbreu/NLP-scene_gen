<L>__{exterior downtown los angeles morning}
<A>__{george is sweating as he walks with his box of personal items under one arm and the model under the other. dizzy, he stops for a moment and tires to orient himself, glancing one way, then the other before staggering back and pressing himself against the building for support. sweat beads and drops from his nose and chin as the song, 'across the universe' begins by the beatles. george sets the box down but clings tightly to the model as he closes his eyes. 'pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind, possessing them, caressing me...' george drops face first to the cement, crushing the model beneath him.}
<B>__{montage as the song continues}
<A>__{george is probed and poked by doctor after doctor. an ultrasound test followed by a ct scan, followed by a mri results in more tests. a flexible tube is slid down george's throat as dye is shot into his body. 'sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my open view, inciting them, inviting me...' a long blunt needle is shoved into george's side for a biopsy of his pancreas. x rays are lit and highlighted as doctors ponder the specks, the disease. finally, george is opened up; nearly bloodless slice through skin, muscle and fat reveals death. 'limitless undying love, which shines around me like a million suns, which calls me on and on across the universe...' george is wheeled down a long hall to the critical care unit. 'nothing's going to change my world, nothing's gonna change my world...'}
