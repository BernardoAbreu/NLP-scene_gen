<L>__{into an unseen pit dug just beneath the surface!}
<A>__{the machine ends up half buried at a steep angle. the semi trailer is right on the edge of the pit. everyone is shaken, bruised, bloodied. val, earl and rhonda look frantically for burt, who was riding out front in the scoop. they're relieved to see him clawing his way out of pit. val hauls him up and all four of them now leap into the semi trailer. as they come to rest, val slowly realizes what's happened.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{they...they dug a trap! i can't believe this!}
<A>__{the idling bulldozer engine coughs and dies. there is a moment's crushing silence. then the dreaded digging begins. dust boils up around the semi trailer creatures digging from below! the semi trailer shakes and shudders, slowly sinking. the people huddle together in sheer panic. val and earl grab the nearest of burt and heather's guns and fire wildly, hope lessly, down at the dirt. ricochets whine into the distance. burt grimly digs an overloaded knapsack for one of his pipe bombs. he leaps up between val and earl and lights the fuse, looking for a target.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{hungry?! eat this!!}
<A>__{he tosses the bomb at some churning earth and dives back into the semi trailer.}
<C>__{burt }
<D>__{keep your heads down!}
<A>__{kaboom! the explosion throws up a big plume of dust and rocks. we hear a new, very strange sound of pain from the creatures. the semi trailer instantly stops shaking. the creatures have stopped digging. all is quiet. the people peer up over the edge of the semi trailer, looking all around. then:}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{there they are!}
<A>__{p.o.v. the group distant creatures numerous spurts of dust mark their paths as they race madly away, fanning out from the semi trailer.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{hey, burt...did you get one...!}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{no, there's still four of them. see...there's like four different dust trails.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{sure got their attention, though. nice going, burt.}
<P>__{(to earl)}
<D>__{earl, what about the cat?}
<A>__{earl's already staring down at the bulldozer.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{no way. it's down for the count.}
<A>__{val looks around. p.o.v. val rock outcrop toward the cliffs he sees a big rock outcrop.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{rhonda points in the opposite direction from where val is looking.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{here they come! they're coming back!}
<A>__{heather unexpectedly fire two deafening blasts from her elephant gun at the approaching creatures, then shakes her head, frustrated. they're still coming.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{come on, everybody! we gotta run for those rocks over there!}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{jesus, val, it's pretty far.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{yeah, man! they'll get us!}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{there sure as hell get us if we stay here!}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{wait, wait, listen. burt do you have any more of those things?}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{the bombs? damn right i do.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{well, what is you throw one that way, the way we want to go...}
<P>__{(points toward rocks)}
<D>__{then, when the explosion happens... if it drives them away again...we all run like goddamn bastards!}
<P>__{(to earl)}
<D>__{pardon my french.}
<A>__{wham! with a jolt the semi trailer begins shaking and shuddering again sinking, smiling.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{what if it doesn't scare them? what if they don't run?}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{i don't think it does scare them! it hurts them! they're so sensitive to sound, they have to run! it hurts too much!}
<A>__{glances all around.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{she's got my vote.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{right. we're gonna run. get ready.}
<A>__{val squats in front of tear streaked mindy.}
<C>__{val }
<D>__{mindy, you understand what we're going to do?}
<P>__{(off her nod)}
<D>__{and don't worry, they can't get us once we're on those rocks.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{i don't know, man. they're too fast! you can't outrun them, no way!}
<A>__{as burt readies another bomb, he pauses to hand bug eyed melvin a huge ruger super redhawk 44 magnum handgun.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{here, kid. this'll make'em think twice.}
<A>__{melvin's eyes bug out further. burt lights his bomb.}
<C>__{burt }
<D>__{heads down!!}
<A>__{he hurls the bomb. wait. wait. whooom! again we hear the creatures' unearthly shriek of pain. rhonda's on her feet before the rocks stop falling. she spots the creatures.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{it worked! there they go!}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{let's do it!}
<A>__{earl lets out a war wild whoop. it's infectious. crane up with them as everyone piles out of the semi trailer like soldiers out of a trench they charge across no man's land. melvin runs like a demon. he tries to shoot at the first thing he sees but the gun just clicks over and over empty.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{burt, you bastard!}
<A>__{enraged, he doubles his speed, trying to overtake burt. mindy can't keep up. nancy tries to pull her along. val and earl swoop in, grab mindy under either arm, and carry her between them. angle the creatures the ground heaves violently as the retreating monsters angrily wheel about and charge back after the humans.}
