<A>__{sometime in the future space silent and endless. the stars shine like the love of god...cold and remote. against them drifts a tiny chip of technology. closer shot it is the narcissus, lifeboat of the ill fated star freighter nostromo. without interior or running lights it seems devoid of life. the ping of a ranging radar grows louder, closer. a shadow engulfs the narcissus. searchlights flash on, playing over the tiny ship, as a massive dark hull descends toward it.}
