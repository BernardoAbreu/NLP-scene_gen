<A>__{it's just woolridge and the two women in the room.}
<C>__{woolridge}
<D>__{well, it surprised the dickens out of me. he said he'll talk to you.}
<A>__{marsha smiles and looks at theresa.}
<C>__{woolridge }
<D>__{but, here's the thing. he'll only talk to you. he doesn't want you to ask him anything. and you shouldn't stare at him.}
<C>__{marsha}
<D>__{how am i going to conduct an interview if i can't ask him any questions?}
<C>__{woolridge}
<D>__{it's the best you're gonna get. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{marsha}
<D>__{can i ask you a question? if he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? what if he does it again? it happens all the time.}
<C>__{woolridge}
<D>__{he's free. his time's up. that's the rules. he's been treated and reevaluated. he doesn't show any signs any more.}
<C>__{marsha}
<D>__{signs?}
<C>__{woolridge}
<D>__{homicidal signs. oh, we're gonna change the light in here for karl. i hope you can see to write.}
<A>__{woolridge turns on a lamp on a desk and turns off the overhead lights. he opens the door and melvin brings karl in. in the semidarkness woolridge pushes a chair up and motions for marsha to sit. karl stands beside melvin motionless. woolridge whispers to theresa.}
<C>__{woolridge }
<D>__{you'll have to step outside.}
<A>__{theresa starts to protest.}
<C>__{woolridge }
<D>__{please.}
<A>__{karl sits down in a folding chair near a lamp as melvin ushers theresa outside into the hallway. karl sits staring at the floor. rubbing his palms together and breathing strangely, as usual. he sits silent for what seems like forever.}
