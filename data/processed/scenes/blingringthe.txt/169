<L>__{interior bilson's bedroom night}
<A>__{they look through her closet. rebecca stands in the doorway of the bathroom that opens on to a dressing area. she looks through drawers, takes a make up bag, and looks through the medicine cabinet. she finds a necklace on the counter a gold chain, with an `r'. she puts it around her neck and clasps it as she looks at herself in the mirror. nicki and sam grab designer purses and clothes. a cat comes up to them.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{she has so many chanel bags.}
<C>__{nicki}
<D>__{i love this one!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{that's so cute.}
<A>__{they load up bags, try on shoes. rebecca closes the bathroom door.}
<C>__{marc}
<D>__{what are you doing in there?}
<C>__{rebecca }
<D>__{when you have to go, you have to go.}
<C>__{marc}
<D>__{are you fucking crazy? how are you so relaxed?}
<A>__{we hear the toilet flush, and rebecca comes out casually with some stuff with her. she looks around the closet. some headlights flash, as a car pulls up outside.}
<C>__{marc }
<D>__{oh fuck, someone's here.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{don't freak out, let's go you guys.}
<A>__{they quickly head out a window onto the roof, as we hear someone entering the house. over the empty room, with stuff all over the floor, we hear someone calling from entrance.}
<C>__{woman's voice }
<D>__{hello? hello?}
