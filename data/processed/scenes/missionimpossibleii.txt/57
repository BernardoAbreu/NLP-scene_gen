<L>__{int incubation zone}
<A>__{in front of each of three large television monitors is a vial shaped roughly like a sealed beaker somewhere between one and two liters in size. each one is contained behind plexiglas and each one pale yellow, one sunset red. behind them are monitors marked, respectively: working seed stock, master seed stock, in vitro virus. behind these is a monitor screen with a blow up of the contents of the vials & the magnitude of the blow up 950,000x. these are x ray microscope blow ups, i.e., allowing the viewer to see the motility of the virus and its metabolism, not dissimilar to an mri this of chimera in its three different cultures.. ethan's on the computer controls, racing thru to working seed stock, which calls for optimal levels of 6.9 ph and 11 degrees celsius. he drops the ph to zero and punches up the temperature to a hundred. the effect on the greenish hue in the bottle is subtle but immediate not so subtle is the effect on the virus seeds viewed microscopically they immediately appear agitated, their microscopic dna innards contracting and expanding. ethan moves on to the master seed stock and the in vitro virus panels on the computer. the changes he makes are reflected on the digital monitoring panels before each viral container.}
<B>__{the working seed}
<A>__{vial has begun to change colors from sea green to a paler pea green. the liquid itself begins to thicken:}
<C>__{computer voice}
<P>__{(female)}
<D>__{alert. chimera working seed stock ph and temperature level outside optimal range.}
<A>__{as the liquid grows more viscous the x ray have a progressively more difficult time penetrating the individual cells, resulting in a low humming sound which grows as the liquid gels.}
<B>__{ethan}
<A>__{at the control panels for maintaining the virus.}
<C>__{another computer voice}
<D>__{alert. chimera master seed stock ph and temperature level outside optimal range.}
<C>__{first computer voice}
<D>__{alert. chimera working seed stock ph at unacceptable level..}
<C>__{third computer voice}
<D>__{alert. chimera in vitro ph and temperature level outside optimal range..}
<C>__{first computer voice}
<D>__{alert. chimera working seed stock ph at critical level. alert. stock life threatened. alert.}
<A>__{the x ray microscope shows the individual seed cells sticking together, some exploding, then all movement ceasing. the liquid itself is suddenly shod thru fluorescent sparks before it congeals to an opaque mush.}
<C>__{first computer voice }
<D>__{alert. chimera stock life..terminated..}
<A>__{simultaneously with the seed stock, ethan's damaging both the working seed in vitro virus. wide angle hot zone ethan places a little plastique on a timer and runs up a ramp to the decontaminant air lock at the back entrance to the hot zone.}
<C>__{billy's voice}
<D>__{how're we doin', then?}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{he should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.}
<C>__{billy's voice}
<D>__{what can we do' mate?}
<C>__{luther}
<P>__{(staring at them)}
<D>__{hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one.}
<A>__{close luther's screen the read and yellow blips are now on the same plane. the yellow dot moves toward the red one as if drawn by a slow motion magnet. down angle ethan looking up as his entire body is hit with air like he's a wind tunnel. when the air flow ceases, a green light goes on.}
<C>__{computer voice}
<D>__{subject is contaminate free. zero contaminate factor. subject contaminate free.}
<A>__{ethan glass observation room heads up a ramp to the three injection guns. hands in gloves he reaches into the chamber for one of the injection guns.}
<C>__{luther's voice}
<D>__{he's still got three injection guns in the test lab..they're loaded with doses of chimera which he'll destroy by firing into a hyper thermal chamber.}
<A>__{he places the barrel of the gun, seals the chamber, and fires. there's a tiny flash of light. ethan withdraws the gun.}
