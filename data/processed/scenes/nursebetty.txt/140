<A>__{betty is sitting on the bed. charlie leans against the wall, facing her. he has trouble starting this.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{... i never meet people like you. i'm a garbageman of the human conditon. i deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. but you... you're different.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i am?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{sure. you could probably have any thing you wanted... somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself, and you don't even realize it.}
<A>__{betty looks curiously over at charlie.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{i'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. i take care of myself, and i got some money socked away. you'd never have to work agin, that's for sure. i'd treat you like a queen.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{umm, i don't think that...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{wait. let me get this out.}
<P>__{(clears his throat)}
<D>__{i like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. i read passionately, and i like to discuss things. i'm basically conservative, but flexible. i've been involved in the death of thirty two people, but i can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty two pieces of shit, excuse my language.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{"thirty two?"}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{well, thirty three, but i'm not counting del, on account of you... so, what do you think?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you probably feel i'm flattering myself to see us together.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i don't feel that, no. i just....i'm not really who you think i am.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{no one is, honey. here, listen to this... "if who i am and who i hope to be should meet one day, i know they will be friends." now that's beautiful.}
<A>__{betty is stunned.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i wrote that when i was twelve... where'd you get that?!}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(he pulls out the diary)}
<D>__{i know. i borrowed it from your grandparents because i... i... it doesn't matter. don't worry, they're fine...}
<P>__{(he gives the diary back)}
<D>__{look, i used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in korea...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i've chased you across the country, betty, and i come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yes, but i'd sort of like to put that behind me now...}
