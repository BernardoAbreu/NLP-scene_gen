<A>__{amelia curled up on the sofa of a cozy, pleasant little home. the doors are open to the patio and yard. winter is different here. tropical flowers, fruit trees in bloom. the phone rings and she picks it up quickly, knowing it's george.}
<C>__{amelia }
<D>__{hi.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{yeh. what's today been like? you still okay?}
<L>__{intercut g:}
<A>__{eorge at his office. he's standing at the window, phone in one hand, single sheet of paper in the other. like the other objects in the box, it is partially singed.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i found something you'd written.}
<A>__{draws a breath. reads...}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{â€˜to touch your hand or see your face today is joy. your casual presence in a room recalls the stars that watched us as we lay.}
<A>__{back to amelia. tears fill her eyes.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{i mark you in the moving crowd and see again those stars a warm night lent us long ago. we loved so then. we love so now.}
