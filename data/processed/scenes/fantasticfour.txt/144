<L>__{interior manhattan night club night}
<A>__{loud music and pulsating lights. a young crowd dances and grinds to the beat. among the colorful lights, streaks of flame swirl around the ceiling. we follow them to: a balcony, where we see johnny sitting in a cozy vip section. he's surrounded by "groupies" climbing over each other to get a look at his various parlour tricks. he leans closer to a young woman. closer. candles around them start to melt. beads of sweat drip down her face.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{what do you say we get out of here?}
<A>__{she pauses. and...a very large man steps up.}
<C>__{johnny }
<D>__{this your boyfriend?}
<A>__{the boyfriend doesn't look too happy.}
<C>__{boyfriend}
<D>__{is that all you do? bar tricks and stealing chicks...}
<A>__{johnny does one more trick...taps the guy's drink...igniting it into a burst of flame. the boyfriend drops the glass, which smashes on the ground...catches the floor on fire. the boyfriend quickly moves in and stamps it out.}
<C>__{girlfriend}
<D>__{what are you doing?! you could have burned somebody!}
<A>__{the boyfriend takes his girlfriend's hand, they start to walk off. she turns back for one last comment...}
<C>__{girlfriend }
<D>__{you know, if i had your power i'd be doing something with it, not wasting my time doing cheap bar tricks, hitting on some other guy's girl.}
<A>__{johnny looks a little embarrassed. the couple leaves. johnny glances around. his fans look down, away. he sees how quickly they can turn. the crowd parts slightly. he looks very alone.}
