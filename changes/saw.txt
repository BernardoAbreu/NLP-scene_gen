<DIAL>__{Written by James Wan & Leigh Whannell}
<ACTION>__{Darkness. The soft sound of moving water can be heard in the background. From the top of the screen a tiny, floating light moves its way downwards across the screen. As it passes, we see just under the water part of a young mans face. His eyes are closed. The light disappears, and across the darkness appears the title S A W. The title fades away. The tiny light appears again, this time floating down at the end of a tub of water, just near someones bare foot. The camera cuts again to the face of the young man underwater. This is ADAM. Suddenly, his eyes fly open and he comes to life, opening his mouth and gasping for air. As he wakes up and struggles within the bathtub, we see his foot catch on a drain plug, unplugging it. The water starts to drain, and we see go with the water the tiny light, which we can also see has some kind of key attached to it. The room itself is pitch black, but we can still just barely make him out in the dark. Adam lifts himself out of the tub and falls onto the floor, coughing and gasping from the shock. He manages to get to his feet, but as he moves forward he realizes that his ankle is chained to something. He feels his way over to a pipe in the corner, reaching down and pulling at his chain that is attached to it. He cries out, his voice frantic, frightened, and a bit hysterical.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Help! Someone help me! (He stops when he hears a loud dragging sound somewhere in the room. He looks out into the darkness and calls out.) Is someone there? Hey!}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(He turns back to the corner to which}
<DIAL>__{he is chained, says in a slightly softer but still panicked voice) Shit, Im probably dead.}
<ACTION>__{Suddenly, from out within the darkness comes a mans low, raspy voice. It startles Adam. The voice, we will soon learn, belongs to LAWRENCE.}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Youre not dead.}
<ACTION>__{Adam quickly turns in the direction of the voice. Holding his arms out for balance, he tries to look across the room to whoever is speaking, but still cannot see a thing.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Whos that? Whos that?!}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(his voice strangely a bit on the calm}
<DIAL>__{side, and almost irritated with Adams reaction to the situation. This shall}
<DIAL_PAR>__{be his tone for many scenes to come.)}
<DIAL>__{Theres no point in yelling, I already tried it.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Turn on the lights!}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Would if I could.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What the fuck is going on? Where am I? (He turns into his corner, touching}
<DIAL_PAR>__{the wall.)}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I dont know yet.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(smelling something; in disgust) What}
<DIAL>__{is that smell?}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Shh! Hang on a second, I think I found something.}
<ACTION>__{With a loud click and an even louder buzzing sound, the very bright fluorescent lights come to life, lighting up in rows, starting from Lawrences end and moving towards Adam. As they come on, Adam is nearly blinded by the sudden change from pitch black to bright white and squints in pain, holding up his arms to cover his face. In the light we now see that he is in his mid-twenties, with short brown hair, wearing a dark blue striped shirt over a white tee shirt and jeans, looking like a drowned rat from the tub. It takes him a moment but his eyes finally start to adjust, and he looks around the room. He and we see Lawrence, who also winces from the glare of the lights, standing by the light switch and the door. He is on the opposite end of the room, also chained to a pipe in the corner by his foot. He wears a blue button-down dress shirt, now soaked with sweat stains. He is middle aged, mid to late forties, with pale blonde hair and even paler skin. Dark circles are under his eyes. Both men are barefoot. Lawrences eyes adjust to the light and he sees across the room. Then, his gaze starts towards the center of the room, as does Adams, who steps forward as much as he can, a look of horror on his face. We see lying face down the body of a man who has blown his brains out, lying in a pool of blood, clad in only boxer shorts and a tee shirt. In his left hand is a gun, in his right hand is a micro cassette recorder. A gunshot and a scream are heard as the camera moves up and in a fast 360 angle above and circling the man, ending in a full overhead view of him. The shot cuts to Adam, who reels in shock and disgust.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Holy shit!}
<ACTION>__{He turns towards the tub and leans over, gagging and coughing. Lawrence in the meantime hops forward the best he can, studying the body with a look of fear and concern. Adam stops coughing and turns back around, takes another look at the body and around the room. He looks down at his chain then starts to completely freak out, grabbing and pulling at his chain.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(screaming) HELP!!! (He falls back onto}
<DIAL>__{his bottom on the floor as he yanks at the chain as hard as he can.) HELP!!! Help!}
<ACTION>__{Lawrence just stands and watches him with an almost embarrassed, appalled look at his behaviour. It seems that Lawrence, despite being in the situation hes in, is above that kind of uncontrolled reaction. He speaks a bit coldly.}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No one can hear you.}
<ACTION>__{Adam stops pulling at the chain, stands up and looks to Lawrence, his breathing fast and heavy. His voice is not yelling anymore but still just as hysterical.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What the fuck is this?}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Calm down, just calm down. (He knows that to remain calm is to remain in control, something he must be no matter what the situation.) Are you hurt?}
<ACTION>__{Adam looks down at himself, shrugging slightly.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I dont know...yeah!}
<ACTION>__{Lawrence moves over to the pipe in the corner, leaning against it for support.}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(calmly) Whats your name?}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(sarcastic) My name is Very Fucking}
<DIAL>__{Confused! (demanding) Whats your name? Whats going on here?}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(internal eye roll; hes getting more and more aggravated with Adams behaviour)}
<DIAL>__{My name is Lawrence Gordon, Im a doctor. I just woke up here, just like you.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(He reaches up, wipes his face with his sleeve)}
<ACTION>__{Adam kneels back down facing the pipe, pulling at his chains once more, but not with his prior panic. He winces at the metal biting into his skin.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(in pain) Ah!}
<ACTION>__{Lawrence looks at Adam with a look that seems to say Im stuck in here with THIS guy? He then glances down at the body.}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Recognize him?}
<ACTION>__{Adam continues to pull at his chains, does not and will not look at the body, just shakes his head.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(sharply) No.}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(trying to get SOMETHING out of this}
<DIAL>__{kid) Well, do you have any idea how you got here?}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No.}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Whats the last thing you remember?}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Nothing. (he sits back onto the floor,}
<DIAL_PAR>__{stops pulling at his chains for a moment.)}
<DIAL>__{I went to bed in my shithole apartment, and woke up in an actual shithole. (He raises his left leg slightly, starts trying to pull his foot out of the iron cuff. He glances to Lawrence, who has moved over to the wall to his left, bent over slightly and resting a hand against a pipe.) So what about you, huh?}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(He shrugs slightly, shaking his head.)}
<DIAL>__{Well theres...theres not much to tell, really. (Across the room, Adam gives up with the chain for the time being but remains sitting on the floor.) I was on my way home from work and uh, I dont remember anything else.}
<ACTION>__{Adam just sits there, glancing over to the body and then focusing on it much more. The initial panic has worn off for now, replaced simply with fear and shock. His voice is a bit softer.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{First dead body Ive ever seen. Look different in real life. They dont move.}
<ACTION>__{Lawrence slowly lowers himself into a sitting position against the wall. He pokes slightly at the iron cuff around his foot.}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{From the looks of these chains, someone didnt want us to go very far either.}
<ACTION>__{Suddenly, Adam leaps up, lifting up his shirt and exposing his abdomen. His panic is back, but not at full force like before. He studies himself then glances to Lawrence.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Can you see any scars?}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(looking at him strangely) What?}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Huh? This is what they do man, (he gestures to his stomach, where there are in fact no scars.) They kidnap you and drug you and before you know it, youre in a bathtub and your kidneys are on eBay.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(A ridiculous theory to us and to Lawrence, but Adam states it with conviction.)}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(a scoffing tone in his voice) No one}
<DIAL>__{has taken your kidneys.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(disbelief) How can you tell from way}
<DIAL>__{over there?}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(matter of fact) Because youd either}
<DIAL>__{be in terrible agony, or youd be dead by now. Trust me.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What are you, a surgeon? (He lowers his shirt and turns and bends down to}
<DIAL_PAR>__{prod at the chain around the pipe again.)}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah. (He sighs. Hes getting tired}
<DIAL_PAR>__{of Adam already. He speaks sharply.)}
<DIAL>__{So, you gonna tell me your name, or what?}
<ACTION>__{Adam stands back up, turns to Lawrence, his voice once again calm.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Adam.}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(getting to his feet, his voice a bit}
<DIAL>__{calmer) Well Adam, what we need to do}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(he leans with one hand outstretched}
<DIAL>__{against the pipe to his right. Adam watches him, scared but calm) is start thinking about why were here. Whoever brought us there couldve killed us by now. But they didnt. They must want something from us. (He looks up and around the room) Question is what. (He sees something up on the wall, moves forwards a bit towards it. We see that it is a brand new clock on the wall, ticking away. It reads currently at 10:22.) That clock.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What about it?}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{Its brand new. (squints, studying it)}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(not getting what hes implying) So?}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(sighs; its quite simple, why cant}
<DIAL>__{Adam see it?) So, someone obviously wanted us to know the time. (Adam looks a bit confused still, mulls over that}
<DIAL_PAR>__{information. Lawrence thinks for a moment.)}
<DIAL>__{Wait, I think I may be able to reach that door.}
<ACTION>__{Lawrence moves over as far as the chain will allow him to the giant, wooden sliding door, pushing against it as hard as he can. In the meantime, we see Adam thinking. He pauses, then reaches down and starts going through his pockets. There is nothing in the front two, but in his back left pocket he pulls out a plastic baggie with a white envelope in it. He unfolds the baggie; the envelope says ADAM. He stares at it in his hands, wondering what it is. Lawrence continues struggling with the door, quickly glances over his shoulder to see what Adam is doing. He sees Adam holding the baggie. Adam reaches into the envelope, pulls out a micro cassette tape. A close up shows the words Play Me written on the tape label. Adam holds it in his hand, studying it. Lawrence turns away from the door, looking over and trying to see what Adam has in his hand.}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What is that? (Adam doesnt answer, continues looking at the tape. Lawrences voice grows impatient.) Excuse me.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(glances up briefly at Lawrence, then}
<DIAL>__{back down at the tape. His voice sounds slightly surprised.) Its a tape.}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Where did you find it?}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It was in my pocket.}
<ACTION>__{Lawrence thinks about that briefly then starts digging through his own pockets, finds within them a white envelope with LAWRENCE written across it in the same black lettering as Adams.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(regarding his tape) It says Play me.}
<ACTION>__{Lawrence tears into his envelope, empties the contents into the palm of his hand. First, he holds up a similar tape to Adams. It also says Play Me. Then he holds up a single bullet, studying it, not sure what its there for yet. Then, he holds up a tiny key. He bends over, gets down on the floor and starts to try to unlock his chains with the key. It doesnt seem to be working.}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(frustrated, mumbling to himself and}
<DIAL>__{to the key) Come on, come on, come on....}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(seeing that it doesnt seem to be working}
<DIAL>__{on Lawrences lock) Throw it over here.}
<ACTION>__{Lawrence gives him a slightly mistrustful look, but then holds up the key and throws it. Adam misses the key at first as it hits the floor in front of the dirty toilet near his corner.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Fuck. (He leans over and picks up the key, then bends down and tries the key on the lock on his ankle, which doesnt work. He tries the lock on the chains around the pipe. It isnt working there}
<DIAL_PAR>__{either.)}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(watching him) No?}
<ACTION>__{Adam gives up, drops the key onto the floor frustratedly, shaking his head. Thats when he looks over to the body again, and the shot closes up on the hand holding the tape recorder. A small loop handle juts out of the hands grip. Adam stands up, then bends down and picks up the tape on the floor, looking at it. He puts it back down then stretches himself flat out on the floor, trying to reach. Unfortunately, there is still a good three to four feet between him and the body.}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Use your shirt.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(gets back up to his knees) What?}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Your shirt.}
<ACTION>__{Adam looks down at himself, then takes off the long sleeved blue shirt. He lays back down, holding the shirt by the ends of each sleeve, and throws it, trying to catch it on the tape recorder. It misses. He tries a second time; same result.}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Come on...}
<ACTION>__{Adam tries again; it misses. It is just barely reaching. He pulls the shirt back, gets back up on his knees, aggravated.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It wont work.}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(trying to get him to not give up yet)}
<DIAL>__{Well, look around, there must be something else you can use.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(stands, ready to give up, skeptical)}
<DIAL>__{Theres nothing.}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(insistent) Well there must be something!}
<ACTION>__{Adam looks around his area, then into the bathtub. He sees something, bends over, takes out the tub plug, which is attached to a long cord. He ties the cord around the sleeve of his shirt. He kneels down, holding out the shirt, aiming.}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Come on, you can do it.}
<ACTION>__{Adam throws it, attempting to get the plug through the loop at the end of the tape recorder. He misses.}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Come on, come on, again.}
<ACTION>__{He tries again and misses. On the third try, however, he gets the plug right through the loop. Lawrence smiles in relief. Adam very slowly pulls it back, dragging the tape recorder along the floor towards him. He picks it up, getting rid of the plug and dropping it and the shirt on the floor. He picks up the tape, pops it in and presses play, holding the tape recorder out a bit so that they can both hear, but keeping his head tilted so he can hear better. A chilling deep, raspy, sinister male voice The Jigsaw Killer comes from the tape. As it speaks, Adams expression is fearful, but the thought How does he know? can be detected.}
<CHAR>__{JIGSAW} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(on tape) Rise and shine, Adam. Youre}
<DIAL>__{probably wondering where you are. Ill tell you where you might be. You might be in the room that you die in. Up until now, you simply sat in the shadows, watching others live out their lives. But what do voyeurs see when they look into the mirror? Now, I see you as a strange mix of someone angry and yet apathetic. But mostly just pathetic. So are you going to watch yourself die today, Adam? Or do something about it?}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(end)}
<ACTION>__{Adam looks frightened but not sure of the entire meaning of the message.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I dont get it. (He presses the stop}
<DIAL_PAR>__{button on the tape.)}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(eagerly, gestures.) Throw me the player.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(pauses, thinks) No, you throw me your}
<DIAL>__{tape.}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(a heavy sigh. He looks at Adam as a}
<DIAL>__{slow-minded fool who simply doesnt understand the full capacity of the situation that theyre in, and speaks to him as such.) Look, were going to have to work together if we want to get out of here. Now just throw it to me.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(picks up on the tone, speaks defensively)}
<DIAL>__{Im not going to risk breaking it! You throw me your tape!}
<ACTION>__{Lawrence pauses, looking at Adam as though hed like to smack him, then holds up and tosses the tape. It hits the floor behind Adam, who kneels down and picks it up, pops it in, presses play. Its the same chilling voice as on Adams tape. As the tape plays, Adam stares at Lawrence, and Lawrence at the tape recorder.}
<CHAR>__{JIGSAW} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(on tape) Dr. Gordon, this is your wake}
<DIAL>__{up call. Every day of your working life, you have given people the news that they are going to die soon. Now you will be the cause of death. Your aim in this game is to kill Adam. (Adam glances down at the tape recorder wide-eyed, then back up at Lawrence) You have until six on the clock to do it. There sa man in the room with you. When theres that much poison in your blood (another view of the body from Lawrences POV), the only thing left to do is shoot yourself.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(Jigsaw coughs) There are ways to win}
<DIAL>__{this hidden all around you. Just remember: X marks the spot for the treasure. If you do not kill Adam by 6:00, then Alison and Diana will die, Dr. Gordon. And Ill leave you in this room to rot.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{Let the game begin. (end)}
<ACTION>__{The looks on each mans face clearly say Oh Shit. The tape ends. Lawrence stands up.}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(firmly) Give me that. Now. (Adam tosses}
<DIAL>__{him the tape. He catches it, rewinds, plays back. Adam stands up from his}
<DIAL_PAR>__{spot on the floor.)}
<CHAR>__{JIGSAW} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(on tape)...then Alison and Diana will}
<DIAL>__{die, Dr. Gordon. And Ill leave you in this room to rot.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(thinking, trying to figure this out)}
<DIAL>__{Any idea who that is?}
<CHAR>__{JIGSAW} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(on tape) Let the game begin.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{He knows us.}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{Wait a minute. (rewinds more)}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(false hope) What do you think? Probably}
<DIAL>__{a joke, right?}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{Shh, shh! (presses play)}
<CHAR>__{JIGSAW} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(on tape) Let the game begin.}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(softly) Listen...}
<CHAR>__{JIGSAW} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(on tape, in a VERY hushed tone after}
<DIAL>__{a brief silence)...Follow your heart.}
<ACTION>__{Lawrence stops the tape.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What the hell does Follow your heart mean?}
<ACTION>__{Lawrence is looking around, on the walls and everywhere else in the bathroom for a heart. He spots a small one drawn in brown on the toilet next to Adam and points.}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{There! Right next to you, on the toilet.}
<ACTION>__{Adam looks, sees the toilet. Slowly, he bends down, resting his hands on the seat, looking down into the bowl of liquid shit, not really sure what hes looking for.}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(impatient, gesturing) Come on, come}
<DIAL>__{on.}
<ACTION>__{Adam glances up at Lawrence with a look of Youve got to be kidding me, but Lawrence watches him expectantly. Adam sighs, then reaches in with his right hand, fishing around in the mess.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh man...(he gasps, making gagging sounds, his face turned away from the bowl. He coughs, fishes around for another brief moment, then quickly pulls back, trying to shake some of the shit off of his hand, spitting.}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(expectantly) Anything?}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(disgusted) No solids.}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Take off the lid. (He points to the lid. Adam looks to it, slowly stands up, reaches for it. Lawrence has no patience.) Come on!}
<ACTION>__{Adam takes off the lid, places it down on the toilet seat. The water is clearer inside, and he reaches in and pulls out something wrapped up in a black garbage bag. He holds it up for Lawrence to see, turns to him.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I really wish I had checked in there first.}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Huh. (he smiles slightly) What is it?}
<ACTION>__{Adam tears into the bag, reaches in and pulls out two hacksaws. He drops the bag on the floor, bends down and takes up his chain, holding one of the hacksaws and beginning to saw at the chain with it. Lawrence watches him for a moment.}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hey! (Adam turns and looks. Lawrence speaks in an irritated voice) Mind passing me the other one?}
<ACTION>__{Adam reaches over and picks up the other hacksaw, then carefully throws it across the room. It hits the pipe to Lawrences left. Lawrence reaches down and picks it up, then sits down on the floor. Quick shot back to Adam, who, while Lawrence is preoccupied with picking up the hacksaw, quickly picks up the garbage bag and tosses it into the bathtub. Both men start to saw away at their chains furiously, but neither are making any progress. Suddenly, Adams saw snaps in the middle, and his temper flares.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(enraged) Fuck! Fuck! (He reacts violently,}
<DIAL>__{hitting the broken saw twice against the iron pipe then turns and hums it across the room, right into a mirror. A small piece of the mirror breaks off}
<DIAL_PAR>__{and flies to the floor.)}
<ACTION>__{Lawrence glances over at what Adam has done, then goes back to sawing for another moment. Adam sits back down, breathing heavily, leaning against the pipe in his corner. Finally, Lawrence gives up, turning and sitting with his back against the pipe, also breathing heavily for a moment. He sits there, when a look of realization comes across his face. He holds up the saw, looking at it, understanding. He lowers it to the floor, shaking his head slightly.}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(everything is becoming more clear now)}
<DIAL>__{He doesnt want us to cut through our chains. He wants us to cut through our feet. (Adam looks up at him, eyebrows raised.) I think I may know whos done this to us.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What did you say? (he stands up; is}
<DIAL_PAR>__{Lawrence hiding something from him?)}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Its not someone I know personally. Its...just someone I know of.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(getting slightly frantic again) Jesus}
<DIAL>__{Christ! Tell me, who is it?!}
<ACTION>__{The camera closes up on Lawrences face. To the right of it, the screen is fading into a flashback of a crime scene. As Lawrence speaks, his face fades and the flashback scene grows clearer, until it is only the crime scene, with three detectives walking down a flight of stairs.}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The last I heard...the police still hadnt caught him.}
<ACTION>__{We now see the three figures descending through a trap door down a flight of stairs. The lighting is a bright lime green that is strangely dark at the same time. The trio enters a small, cell like room with a low ceiling. They are TAPP, SING, and KERRY. Tapp is a tall black man in his late forties-early fifties. Sing is an Asian man in his mid to late thirties, and Kerry is a Caucasian woman in her mid to late thirties with long, curly brown hair that is tied back in a ponytail. All are well dressed, Sing and Tapp in suits, the woman in a jacket and dress slacks. They are the detectives working on this case. As they move into the room, Sing sees something that brings a look of shock to his face, shining a flashlight on it. We cannot see it yet.}
<CHAR>__{LAWRENCE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

Died of massive blood loss. Mostly through the femoral artery. (The camera pans around to Detective Tapp, who moves around the side fo the cage to get a better look inside, shining his flashlight in.) He started at the back of the cage and tunneled his way through the razor wire so fast its amazing he got as far as he did. Cut himself so deep, we found traces of stomach acid on the floor.

Tonight, youll show me. The irony is that if you want to die, you just have to stay where you are. But if you want to live, youll have to cut yourself again. (Flashback shot of Paul waking up in the cage, looking around, scared and confused. The shots go back and forth between the detectives and the Paul flashback, with him grabbing and shaking the razor wire, screaming. His screams sound distant under Jigsaws voice.)

But watch your step (Marks bare foot steps on the broken glass scattered all across the floor).

He moves in a circle, clockwise to us. When he gets to facing right in front of us, the flame from the candle flares up and engulfs the shot, flaring into a close-up crime scene photo of Marks charred face.

Lawrence opens the door and enters, and the two detectives turn to look at him. He removes his white coat and hangs it on a rack by the door. Tapp speaks first, his tone is friendly, but searching.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(quietly, giving in.) Okay.}
<ACTION>__{Camera moves into the Interrogation room with Amanda, Tapp, and the unidentified man. As Tapp speaks, the camera slowly moves closer over his shoulder and towards Amanda. As we get closer to her, we see long, strange, scar-like markings along each side of her mouth. She is shaken, her eyes distant, never looking anyone, including Tapp, in the eye. It is clear that her mind is still lost somewhere within her nightmare.}
<CHAR>__{TAPP} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(speaking slowly, gently) Amanda...in}
<DIAL>__{your own time, tell me the first thing you remember.}
<ACTION>__{We move closer and closer to Amanda, then suddenly the camera spins round quickly and snaps into an alternate view of her, her flashback. The room she is in has the same lime-green lighting as Pauls cell. Amanda sits in a chair wearing a strange iron contraption around her head, a bear-trap like device covering her mouth. We can see her eyes, surrounded with black eyeliner, as they slowly open, groggy, just waking up.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(VO) I woke up. All I could taste was}

<ACTION>__{She continues to struggle against her bonds some more. The camera circles around her, and we get a better view of the strange device on her head, and the padlock and timer on the back of it. A long wire hangs down from the timer and below the screen. The view switches to the side of her and we see next to her an old television set, which suddenly switches on, startling her. After a brief moment of static, the frightening image of a demented clown-like doll its face white with red spirals on its cheeks, its red eyes leering at Amanda from the screen. She stares at it, her moans a bit softer to match her fear and utter confusion. The doll speaks, the jaw moving; it is the voice of Jigsaw.}

Here, Ill show you.}
<ACTION>__{The video pans back to a view of the doll and the device. The dolls head moves and looks down at the device, and the camera zooms in on it. A timer ticks away. A few seconds later, SNAP! The device springs and the fake head is crushed and explodes. Amanda shrieks, her eyes widening. The video switches back to a close up of the doll.}
<CHAR>__{JIGSAW} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(from the TV) There is only one key}
<DIAL>__{to open the device. Its in the stomach of your dead cellmate. Look around, Amanda. Know that Im not lying. You better hurry up. Live or die. Make your choice.}
<ACTION>__{The video goes to white and gray static, then switches off. Amanda begins to struggle like a madwoman against her bonds and the chair. The camera swings around her, circling, making her movements fast and jerky. Amanda manages to pull one arm free, then the other and stands up quickly. Thats when the cord in the back of the device is pulled out, and the timer starts. She freezes, her eyes widening. We see a close-up of the timer, and it begins its sixty second countdown. She reaches behind her head, pulling at the lock and the timer, trying to pull it off, but it is stuck there. She starts freaking out, pulling at it as much as she can, the camera movements once again fast and jerky around her. The camera spins back to Amanda sitting still in her chair in the interrogation room, sniffling. We see a brief shot of Lawrence, who watches and listens to her with grim amazement. Back to Amanda.}
<CHAR>__{AMANDA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And then I saw the body.}
<ACTION>__{We switch back into Amandas cell. Over her shoulder, we see near the corner the body of a man lying on the floor on his back. Amanda cautiously approaches it, the timer still ticking away, her hands still at the device. She kneels down cautiously next to him. She reaches down and with a shaking hand lifts up his shirt, revealing a large, black question mark drawn on his abdomen. She sobs harder, hunched over him. Quick cut to the interrogation room, Amanda in the center of the shot.}
<CHAR>__{AMANDA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{There was a knife.}
<ACTION>__{Back to the cell. Amanda, still leaning over, picks up a small knife next to the body. She slowly brings it up in both of her shaking hands, clutching it. She looks closer at it. A quick shot of the timer shows it to be at 25 seconds now, almost halfway. The camera moves to a shot of the mans face, when... HE OPENS HIS EYES AND STARTS TO WAKE UP. He moans, unable to speak or move. His eyes slowly, groggily look around a bit. He cannot even open his mouth; someone has very heavily drugged him. He sees Amanda over him with a knife and his eyes widen; he tries to moan at her to stop, to not do what shes about to do, but she turns the knife upside down in both hands and quickly stabs down. He moans in agony in the background as she stabs down again, and again, and again. Blood splashes on her hands. A quick shot back of Lawrence as he listens, his mouth open slightly, eyes wide, staring at her. Cut back to Amanda in the cell as she stabs down a few more times.

Back to interrogation room Amanda, the horror on her face growing, then back to the cell. Amanda s hand pulls a small key from inside the organ shes holding. She reaches around the back of her head, quickly trying to unlock the padlock. The timer ticks away, faster and faster. She gets it, pulls off the padlock and opens the device in the back, ripping it away from her head and throwing it down as it snaps open. She lets out the most terrible, agonized, heart-wrenching scream, sobbing loudly, her hands held out in front of her, rocking back and forth. Suddenly from another corner of the room, a light comes on, revealing the puppet from the video in the corner. Amanda sees it, staring at it wide eyed, her sobs softening for a moment as she stares at it. Slowly, it wheels towards her on a tricycle. She can only stare and cry, not sure what to do or expect. It stops, leering at her, then speaks.}

The camera then cuts back to Amanda, who starts sobbing more heavily again. Slowly, the camera moves down into and under the table, fading back into an overhead view of the bathroom where Lawrence and Adam are. Adam sits in his corner, staring down at the floor as he has been listening to Lawrences story. He looks up across to Lawrence.}

He lifts it up and throws it as hard as he can against the mirror, shattering most of the glass. Lawrence briefly startles at the sound and force of the glass shattering. Adam reaches back down, finds another piece of debris and throws that at the mirror with just as much force. The rest of the glass breaks away, and a camera with a red light can bee seen behind a clear glass. Lawrence stands up to get a better look at it. We movie in closer to the camera, getting a better look at it as well. Suddenly there is a flash of static and we find ourselves looking at a fuzzy, black and white surveillance video of Lawrence and Adam in the bathroom, staring right at us into the camera. The shot pulls back a bit and we see that the video is on a silver surveillance monitor. A partial view of other recording-type equipment can be seen on either side of the monitor. A mans voice speaks, though it doesnt sound quite the same as on the Jigsaw tapes. As he speaks, a hand wearing a black leather glove raises up slightly and waves its fingers at the screen.}

<DIAL>__{Ive been the last thing I said to my daughter.}
<ACTION>__{Lawrence turns away from Adam, placing his hand on the pipe behind him, and the shot moves up into blackness, then up at the foot of a little girls bed in a darkened bedroom. The little girl is Diana. Shes about 5 or 6 years old, with long, wavy light brown hair. She lays tucked in with her eyes closed, her favourite teddy bear wrapped in her left arm. The camera moves up and over her a bit, moving in closer to her. Chimes can be heard tinkling very faintly against a soft breeze. As the shot pauses just above her, her eyes suddenly open, blinking away sleepiness. She sits up, pulling away the covers, still holding her teddy bear. She remains sitting in her bed, staring over into the dark corner to her right. The chimes jingle away. We move in closer to her face; something has her spooked. A clock ticking is suddenly heard as the image fades from Diana getting out of bed into a strange, mechanical-looking clock on the living room wall of the Gordon Household. The shot lowers and we see the nicely furnished living room of the Gordon home. The walls are a dark, crimson red, the furniture in tones of red and brown. It definitely is the living room of a well-off family. Not too cold, but not as warm and homey as it could be. Diana slowly makes her way across the living room towards her parents bedroom, moving almost dream-like, her teddy bear hanging limply from her right hand. She moves to the frosted glass double doors of her parents room, opening them both into the bedroom, where we see her mother, Alison, laying on her side, fast asleep. Alison is in her early to mid thirties with long blond hair going just past her shoulders and very pretty despite her sleepiness and messy hair in this scene. Diana moves into the room, standing next to the bed, saying nothing, just watching her mother sleeping. Alisons eyes slowly open; the feeling of being watched plus the instincts of a mother have awoken her. She reaches over and turns on the light, looking upon her daughter with concern.}

Alison, her eyes streaming tears, struggles and pulls against her bonds to try to get at him but fails. Diana keeps crying Mommy! over and over again and sobbing.

Cut up to a staircase, lit by eerie green light, the same as from Pauls razor wire room, as the detectives make their way up cautiously, Tapp in front, Sing covering behind them.

A contraption on the chair holds two power drills about six inches from either side of his head, pointed directly at his temples. His eyes wide, he moans through his tape at the detectives.

Sing and Tapp go and hide behind a tarp covering the entryway to another room while a figure in a black robe lined in red comes up on the elevator. The elevator stops, and the figure moves forward, slowly and carefully. He goes up the steps to the man in the chair. The figures hood is up; we do not see his face. As he walks, he seems like he might be having a somewhat difficult time with it. He reaches and uncovers the man, who begs in muffled tones through the gag.

He moves down a long, misty corridor, gun up, moving quickly but still cautiously. He takes a right, goes down another flight of stairs then takes another right, stopping and looking down a short flight of stairs. Quick cut to Tapp starting to try to get up, holding his throat. He drags himself along the floor. Back to Sing, who cocks his shotgun, then moves down the stairs very cautiously. He takes a left around the corner, finds himself facing down another corridor, where he sees Jigsaw trying to get away. He takes aim.}

<ACTION>__{Jigsaw continues moving, so Sing fires. He hits, and Jigsaw goes down. Sing pauses, waiting to see if he gets back up. Jigsaw doesnt move, so Sing cocks the gun again and starts to slowly move forward towards him. Cut to a shot of Tapp as he struggles to his feet and starts towards the stairs to follow Sing. Back to Sing, moving further down the hall. He gets about halfway down it when we see a shot of his feet just at a trip-wire. Over it are some cobwebs hanging down. He reaches to part them, and steps forward into the wire. As he steps we see a shot of a shotgun with wire slowly pulling down on the trigger. Sing looks up, and the trigger of that gun and six other shotguns pointing down directly at him fire. Sing is hit, blood splattering against him and the wall. We see only from his shoulders down. He spasms for a moment, then falls forward to his knees. Cut to Tapp, who is making strange vowel sounds, moving down the flight of stairs just before the hallway where Sing now is. On his knees, Sing remains upright for a moment, spasming more. We go to a shot of Jigsaw on the floor. Jigsaw starts moving and gets himself up to his feet, and starts hobbling further down the hall. Sings body finally falls forward onto the floor, spasming still. Tapp continues down the stairs, falling against the wall a couple of times. We see Jigsaw as he gets to the end of the hall and starts sliding a large door open. At that moment, Tapp reaches the bottom of the stairs and turns into the hallway, collapsing back into a sitting position on the stairs. Jigsaw hobbles through the door and starts to go left. Tapp sits up a bit and looks down the hall, where he sees Sing, who has stopped spasming. His eyes widening, Tapp removes the hand from his throat and reaches forward towards Sing, his mouth opening and moving but no sound other than some gasping coming out. The shot fades to a slow-paced black and white, and then snaps into a few crime scene photos of Sings body, including a nice gory one of the top of his head, part of which is now missing. At the last photoflash, we cut back to a shot of Tapp presently, sitting on his couch. The shot shows a good view of the scar across his neck.}

As it beeps, we cut to another shot of his car in the mirror. The back door on the passenger side starts to slowly open. Back to Lawrence, who hangs up the phone, aggravated, and reaches into his pocket for his cell phone. He opens it and dials. Back in the mirror, we see something get out of the car on its hands and knees. It is in a red robe and has a strangely shaped head with long, tangly dark hair. Lawrence finishes dialing, holds the phone to his ear but receives the same beeping tone as the phone in the bathroom, indicating that he cannot make outgoing calls. Perplexed, he holds up the phone, trying to get a better signal. Alongside the car, the thing moves even closer now. It gets up slowly. We see that it is wearing the strange boar mask previously seen in the flashback of Jigsaws workshop. It suddenly rushes upon him as hes distracted with his phone and grabs him.

He throws it to Adam, who reaches down and picks it up from where it lands. Lawrence throws the lighter as well. Adam puts the cigarette between his lips and reaches down, picking up the lighter. He glances over at Lawrence, who watches him intently. Adam just shrugs then lights up. He takes a long drag, then exhales in a sigh of relief and with a smile. He takes another drag then suddenly freezes, his head jerking and a strange gurgling sound coming from his throat. His head jerks more then the rest of his body, his eyes widening. His hand drops the cigarette and goes to his throat as he turns, still jerky and making a strange, almost squeaky choking sound in his throat. The sound grows louder as he falls to his knees, then back a bit, his left arm held out in front of him dramatically. He falls backwards onto the floor, twitching some more, still choking. He lets out a long cough, suddenly stops jerking, and closes his eyes. The death in its entirety is very, very fake.}

<DIAL>__{how I got here.}
<ACTION>__{Flashback to Adam walking up the stairs in his apartment building, a camera around his neck, smoking a cigarette and listening to music on his headphones. He walks with an uncaring, slow swagger. He gets to the top of the stairs and walks down a red-lit hallway to his apartment. He goes inside, closing the door behind him then moving into the kitchen area, throwing his keys onto the table and opening the fridge. The entire apartment is very rundown, decrepit, dingy and old; truly a shithole apartment as Adam described it earlier. There is graffiti on the door and walls, the wallpaper is fading and peeling, the refrigerator is dirty. Adam opens the fridge and looks inside for a moment. He sighs, then closes the door. He heads over to his darkroom, closing the door behind him. The lighting is dark red. He puts the camera down on the table, taking the strap off from around his neck, takes off his headphones and cd player, presses stop and puts them down off to the side. He sighs tiredly and goes over to a tray where a photo is developing and picks it up with his fingers, ganging it with a closepin on a hanging line with other photos. It is a picture of a man wearing sunglasses. The man is in fact Lawrence. To the left of that one is a shot of Lawrence in the parking garage with his hand over his eyes. The camera cuts to a shot of the newest photo through a peephole in the darkroom door as the camera fades out and back, viewing the grafittied door of the darkroom before the shot fades to black, industrial music playing over the shot. Cut to Adam sleeping in the now pitch-black darkroom, his head down on the table. He wakes up abruptly, as though he hadnt meant to fall asleep. He looks around, confused, wondering why all the lights out. He gives a Great, another problem type of sigh. He stands and yawns, reaching over for the lightswitch. He moves it up and down a few times, but nothing happens. Another aggravated sigh. He reaches down and finds a flashlight on the counter, presses the on button but it doesnt work. Pissed, he shakes it hard, trying to get it to come on, but that doesnt work. He looks at it, scoffs.}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Great.}
<ACTION>__{Suddenly, he hears something move outside the door, somewhere in his apartment. On alert, he listens. He looks down and picks up his camera, slinging it around his neck and holding it out in front of him. He opens the creaky door into his also pitch-black apartment. He takes a few steps forward, speaks nervously, but trying to be brave.}

<DIAL>__{Is someone there? (he takes a picture, the flash lighting up the area in front of him.) I can hear you. (He takes another picture, the flash lighting up a living room area. Nothing yet. He moves forward more, into the kitchen entryway, snapping}

<DIAL_PAR>__{move forward and grab Adam.)}
<ACTION>__{Suddenly, the cell phone rings. Lawrence looks down at it in slight surprise. Adam snaps out of his daze to look at it as well.

He sees the flash from the window on the television. He picks up his handgun and loads it quickly, gets up and heads out. Back in the apartment, we see Diana cowering, still tied, holding her teddy bear. Zep gets behind Diana, tries to grab her but she keeps her arms and the gun upwards. Another shot is fired off.}

Zep gets the gun in his right hand and wraps his left arm around Alison, who quickly pulls open and takes out of the top drawer a pair of scissors. She spins around and with a scream stabs Zep in his left leg. He screams in pain and goes down, falling onto his side, clutching his leg by a wooden column, moaning in pain. Alison quickly goes over and finishes untying Diana. Cut to the Main Hall of the residence, where we see Tapp enter and move down the hall with his gun ready. He moves cautiously but quickly.

Back to the bedroom, Tapp stands next to another wooden column and fires at Zep again, missing. Alison finishes untying Diana and the book from the room. Zep fires at Tapp again and misses.

Zep pushes his way up but Tapp grabs him from behind, pulling him towards him. Cut back to Lawrence, still on the floor, sobbing with the phone clutched in his hand. Back to Tapp and Zep, who get up to their feet. Zep grabs a vase on the floor and turns, smashing it over Tapps head. The blow stuns Tapp and sends him down. Zep kneels down and picks up his gun, then gets back up and starts hobbling after Alison and Diana. He reaches the living room, but they are no where to be seen.}

He empties his gun cartridge and replaces it, then runs towards the door, screaming.}
<ACTION>__{Back to Lawrence crying on the floor of the bathroom. Hes just a complete wreck, making low moaning sounds. Suddenly, there is a loud buzzing sound his body is jerked up and he is flung onto his back as he is electrocuted. Adams eyes widen and he starts to panic.}

He lays flat on the floor, just a foot away from it, trying desperately to grab it. In the hallway, Tapp enters, keeping his gun aimed out in front of him. He looks down the hallway, sees nothing. Cut to Zep climbing down a ladder into another level, grunting in pain. Tapp hears him and follows the sound down the hall. In the bathroom, the phone keeps ringing. Lawrence grabs the hinged box, turns it upside down and tries to catch the phone with it. He cannot reach, and starts to cry loudly again. He tosses the box away, crying/screaming as he tries to reach the box with his arms. Adam watches with a terrified look, not knowing what to do. Zep reaches the bottom of the ladder, leaning against it, moaning from the pain of his leg. He hears Tapp above him, hobbles off further down the hallway. Tapp climbs down the ladder, moving in the same direction as Zep. As Tapp can move faster than Zep, he rounds the corner and catches Zep hobbling down the hallway. Zep turns and sees him, firing a few shots but missing. Tapp ducks behind a large stone column jutting out of the wall. He leans out and fires at Zep. Zep falls back slightly but remains standing. If he got hit, it isnt clear where. Zep then turns and quickly hobbles further down the hall. Cut back to Lawrence still crying and trying to get the phone as it keeps ringing.}

Lawrence screams through the cloth between his teeth. The blood squirts up onto Lawrences shirt and neck. Adam collapses to the floor in his corner, screaming and wincing. Back to Zep rounding another corner in the hallway. He moves into an old break room and Tapp runs in after him, finally catching up. Tapp tackles him, tripping him backwards and causing Zep to hit his head against and old mini-refrigerator. Tapp grabs him and brings him up, throwing him hard against the stone wall. Zep falls down to his side. Tapp grabs him up and throws him forward against a cage wall. Back to Lawrence, still sawing away, blood on his face, neck and shirt. Back to Tapp pummeling Zep from behind in the back. A look of twisted glee is upon Tapps face as he hits Zep. Zep falls to the floor, gun beside him. He looks like he just wants to curl up and die. Tapp goes down for the gun but Zep reacts, grabbing it. Tapp grabs his hand, and Zep pushes himself up into a standing position, the wall in front of him, Tapp pushing up behind him, trying to take the gun. Back in the bathroom, Adam is on his hands and knees, screaming and crying as he begs Lawrence to stop. Lawrence does stop, sits up and tosses the saw of to the side. Adam collapses forward a bit. Back to Zep and Tapp, who continue struggling from the gun. Zep squeezes his way down, groaning as he suddenly drops down between Tapp and the wall, his gun aimed up at Tapp. He pulls the trigger and the shot hits Tapp in the chest, a loud surprise to the former detective. Back in the bathroom, Lawrence crawls along the floor, moaning. He finds and picks up the single bullet from his envelope, looks at it. Adam watches him in terror.}
