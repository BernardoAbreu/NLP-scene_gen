<A>__{the "opera on ice" continues. the soprano continues singing as smoochy reenacts the incidents of his recent life. the fairy princess brings smoochy to a room with a gleaming white desk. smoochy takes a seat behind the desk. the fairy princess places a crown on his head, bids him good bye, and floats away. smoochy sits proudly in his new world. suddenly, rhinettes dressed as devils glide in and skate in a circle around the desk. they throw money at smoochy. he jumps up and skates away, but the rhinette devils pursue him with daggers. the music from the orchestra intensifies as the drama plays out.}
