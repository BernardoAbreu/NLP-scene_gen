<L>__{exterior rain forest morning}
<A>__{a line of viet soldiers moves through the shimmering jungle.}
<B>__{camera booms up}
<A>__{as they move past, revealing others beyond, and the tops of parked trucks. the move ends on rambo, watching from the branches of a tree as they move by only a few meters below. the choppers search methodically nearby.}
<L>__{interior interrogation room}
<A>__{brewer is trussed tightly, his elbows tied together and drawn up painfully by a cord attached to a ceiling fixture. palyushin looms in front of him, holding the truck tire bludgeon. podovsk, looking the worse for wear with a bandage covering half his face, sits on the stool. the gaze of his exposed eye is malevolent.}
<C>__{podovsk}
<P>__{(wearily)}
<D>__{i think you know where he is going. is there a rendezvous point? some guerrilla contract? a transmitter perhaps.}
<C>__{brewer}
<P>__{(earnestly)}
<D>__{no way. if i say anything... that's three.}
<A>__{the interrogator scowls, briefly perplexed.}
<C>__{podovsk}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{i cannot be responsible for the safety of the prisoners if he is not captured. this government now considers the existence of pows an embarrassment. an unmarked grave in the jungle may be their solution. i am only an advisor.}
<C>__{brewer}
<D>__{advise my dick, you siberian scumbag.}
<A>__{palyushin explodes with a brutal blow to brewer's ribs, which doubles him over in agony. he struggles to regain his breath, dragging at the air like a terminal emphysema patient. brewer slowly raises his head.}
<C>__{brewer}
<P>__{(sneering)}
<D>__{ke rist. whattaya trying to do, man, tickle me?}
<A>__{palyushin snarls and smashes the truncheon down even harder.}
