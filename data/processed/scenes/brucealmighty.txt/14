<D>__{is something killing your kids? find out tonight at eleven.}
<A>__{bruce looks at the sign quizzically for a beat, then continues on.}
<B>__{in the room}
<A>__{the morning meeting is well in progress. leading the group is the station manager and bruce's boss, jack keller, 50's, a constant furrow in his brow. also in the room: bruce's fellow field reporter and rival evan baxter, 30' s , a walking statement. impeccable posture, perfect speech, perfect everything and he knows it. fred donohue, the ever jovial sports reporter; always tanned, vain weatherman, dallas coleman and segment producer ally loman.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{okay, promos are approved, let's }
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{ah, isn't that last one a little misleading? i mean, the story's about flu shots. do we have to scare people to death?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{no, just into watching. or i could change it to: "slow news day, come yawn with us. at eleven."}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{sniffles at eleven is nice.}
<C>__{dallas}
<D>__{attack of the killer sniffles?}
<C>__{ally}
<P>__{(to dallas)}
<D>__{the tanning booth is starting to zap your brain, you know that?}
<C>__{dallas}
<D>__{i don't use a tanning booth.}
<A>__{a beat and they all crack up.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{come on. you're turning orange.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{he looks florida ripe to me. .}
<A>__{more laughs.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i would have swore i already said this, but promos are approved. now can we move on?}
<C>__{ally}
<D>__{jack, shouldn't the promos be focusing on pete's retirement. this is his last week.}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(leading)}
<D>__{yeah, yeah. any word on the open anchor position, jack?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{evan, you'11 know something when i know something.}
<A>__{bruce bursts into the room. the meeting stops. jack doesn't need to say anything, he just looks at his watch.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{sorry, jack. it wasn't my fault. the traffic was you guys already played the spots?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{nice story, bruce, but we're going with evan's piece on the sex scandal at the mayor's office for sweeps.}
<A>__{this hits bruce hard. a beat of silence.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{and that's the way the cookie crumbles.}
<A>__{the others chuckle. only ally remains sympathetic.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i'm just messin' with you, bruce. see you've got to remember that the news room is like a cookie...}
<A>__{more laughs.}
<C>__{bruce}
<P>__{(re: evan's perfect posture)}
<D>__{that's great evan.}
<C>__{bruce }
<D>__{is you're posture naturally that good, or do you have to shove a stick up there?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{okay, knock it off... bruce we're holding your story in reserve. now, can we get back to the board so we have something to air today?}
<A>__{jack continues with assignments. evan sits smugly, as bruce slides down into his chair, deflated.}
