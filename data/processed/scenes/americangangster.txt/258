<A>__{richie removes the cover plate of an elevator, cuts the wires, disengaging it, then leads the amigos, followed by more detectives to a stairwell. the place is like beirut. debris strewn, graffiti covered. frank walks past graves to bumpy's. replaces some dried flowers with fresh ones. looks around for something to sit on. sees some wooden folding chairs around a fresher grave nearby. doc waits by the car in the distance.}
