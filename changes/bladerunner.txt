<ACTION_ALT>__{THE EYE}
<ACTION>__{It's magnified and deeply revealed. Flecks of green and yellow in a field of milky blue. Icy filaments surround the undulating center. The eye is brown in a tiny screen. On the metallic surface below, the words VOIGHT-KAMPFF are finely etched. There's a touch-light panel across the top and on the side of the screen, a dial that registers fluctuations of the iris. The instrument is no bigger than a music box and sits on a table between two men. The man talking is big, looks like an over-stuffed kid. "LEON" it says on his breast pocket. He's dressed in a warehouseman's uniform and his pudgy hands are folded expectantly in his lap. Despite the obvious heat, he looks very cool. The man facing him is lean, hollow cheeked and dressed in gray. Detached and efficient, he looks like a cop or an accountant. His name is HOLDEN and he's all business, except for the sweat on his face. The room is large and humid. Rows of salvaged junk are stacked neatly against the walls. Two large fans whir above their heads.}

<DIAL>__{Okay if I talk?}

<CHAR>__{LEON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{HOLDEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What?}
<CHAR>__{LEON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What desert?}
<CHAR>__{HOLDEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.}
<CHAR>__{LEON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But how come I'd be there?}
<CHAR>__{HOLDEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows. So you look down and see a tortoise. It's crawling towards you...}
<CHAR>__{LEON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{A tortoise. What's that?}
<CHAR>__{HOLDEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{LEON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Of course.}

<CHAR>__{LEON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But I understand what you mean.}
<CHAR>__{HOLDEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon.}
<ACTION>__{Keeping an eye on his subject, Holden notes the dials in the Voight-Kampff. One of the needles quivers slightly.}
<CHAR>__{LEON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You make these questions, Mr. Holden, or they write 'em down for you?}
<ACTION>__{Disregarding the question, Holden continues, picking up the pace.}
<CHAR>__{HOLDEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun, beating its legs trying to turn itself over. But it can't. Not without your help. But you're not helping.}
<ACTION>__{Leon's upper lip is quivering.}
<CHAR>__{LEON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?}
<CHAR>__{HOLDEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?}
<ACTION>__{Leon looks shocked, surprised. But the needles in the computer barely move. Holden goes for the inside of his coat. But big Leon is faster. His LASER BURNS a hole the size of a nickel through Holden's stomach. Unlike a bullet, a laser causes no impact. It goes through Holden's spine and comes out his back, clean as a whistle. Like a rag doll he falls back off the bench from the waist up. By the time he hits the floor, big slow Leon is already walking away. But he stops, turns and with a little smile of satisfaction, FIRES at the machine on the table. There's a flash and a puff of smoke. The Voight-Kampff is hit dead center, crippled but not destroyed; as Leon walks out of the room, one of its lights begins to blink, faint but steady.}

<LOC>__{INT. TRAIN - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{No clickitty-clack of track-bound noise, it's a long, insulated Pullman of contoured seats and low-keyed lighting, coloured to soothe,and empty, except for the passenger half way down. His eyes closed, head rested against the glass. Ten years ago, DECKARD might have been an athlete, a track man or a welter-weight. The body looks it, but the face has seen some time -- not all of it good.}

<LOC>__{INT. TRAIN - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Tired of the program, he takes off the headset and drops it next to three empty beer bottles and a sandwich wrapper, adjusts his position and winds up staring at his reflection in the window. Runs a hand over his face, it could use a shave. He leans closer and peers through the glass. Out there in the black a sign flashes past: SAN ANGELES, THREE MINUTES.}
<LOC>__{EXT. PLATFORM - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The train slides in, smooth as an eel, and stops with- out a sound. Carrying a bag and umbrella, Deckard disembarks ahead of the other passengers and into the sweltering night.}
<LOC>__{INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Deckard has got his coat swung over his shoulder, his shirt already damp, as he walks down the long, hollow passage under orbs of yellow light.}
<LOC>__{EXT. TERMINAL - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Deckard unlocks his car and gets in. Turns the ig- nition and hits a sensor. The dash console glows and Deckard sits back waiting for the air unit to cool things off.}

<DIAL>__{It was 97 degrees in the city and no hope of improvement. Not bad if you're a lizard. But two hours earlier I was drinking Acquavit with an Eskimo lady in North East Alaska. That's a tough change to make. It was so good, I didn't want to leave, so I left a day early.}
<ACTION>__{A little detached, Deckard taps another sensor on the panel, lights up a cigarette and watches as his mes- sages flash across the viewer stating date, time and caller. The last one is repeated five times. Deckard sighs, switches off the viewer and gets on the radio.}

<DIAL>__{I-X-4-P-D referred to as a Nexus-6, The Tyrell Corporation's new pride and joy. Holden was administering the Voight-Kampff test when one nailed him.}

<CHAR>__{DECKARD } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}

<LOC>__{INT. INSPECTOR BRYANT'S OFFICE - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The INSPECTOR is in his fifties. The deep creases in his face, the broken capillaries in his nose say brawler, spoiler, drinker, but the diplomas on the wall say something else. Bryant's kneeled at his safe trying to open it. Deckard it sitting on the edge of the desk reading the print-out.}
<CHAR>__{DECKARD } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{They escaped from the colonies two weeks ago. Killed twenty- three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol found the ship in the desert. No crew.}

<DIAL>__{Bryant's got a liver problem. A couple years back he handed me a bottle and said have a drink for another man. I been drinking for him ever since.}

<DIAL>__{Six, huh?}
<CHAR>__{BRYANT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Five. Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation. Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.}

<DIAL>__{What was he after?}
<CHAR>__{BRYANT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure. But bio- chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing. Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees. Guess he found himself one.}
<ACTION>__{A grim pause.}
<CHAR>__{DECKARD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You got a machine on it yet?}
<CHAR>__{BRYANT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm. Its guess is that all five are in the city.}

<CHAR>__{BRYANT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{DECKARD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thanks.}
<ACTION>__{Like a sick boy looking out of the window, Bryant watches Deckard down the whiskey. Deckard puts down the glass and turns to leave.}
<CHAR>__{DECKARD } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{The big incentive to emigrate was still free labor. If the public found out that their door-prizes might kill them, they might not be so hot to go up there. This was one of the worst one's we had and Bryant was worried. He wanted to tell me to be discrete or something. But I didn't give him a chance.}
<LOC>__{EXT. LEON'S HOTEL ENTRANCE - NIGHT}

<LOC>__{INT. LEON'S HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{A heavy metal maze of cubicles and perilous iron balconies, peopled with rejects from the surface world; Mato Grosso Indians in white man's clothes and other lower echelon welfare recipients. Drop city is crowded, cramped and darkly alive. Deckard steps out of an elevator and moves through the crowd. A cloud of steam drifts up through a grating as two old men, clad in towels descend a flight of stairs under a neon sign that says bath house. A musty subterranean wind ripples Deckard's clothes as he turns into an alcove. He stops in front of a door that says, MANAGER and pushes the buzzer. It's opened by an emphysema victim with an oxygen tank lashed to his hip. Deckard flashes his ID and speaks some words which are inaudible due to the TUBA MUSIC down the hall. The man grabs a key from his wall, hands it over and shuts the door.}
<LOC>__{INT. LEON'S HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The companion ways below deck of a big ship are no more bewildering than the ups and downs and ins and outs of this establishment. But Deckard finds the door he's looking for. He pauses a moment, listens, then knocks. He inserts the key and with a hand on his gun opens it.}
<LOC>__{INT. LEON'S ROOM - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{An empty room. A cot and not much else. He steps in and stands quiet as a hunter sensing the signs. For a place surrounded by greasy hovels it is surprisingly clean. Spartan in fact. The towel by the spotless basin is perfectly folded. Deckard runs two fingers over a shelf. No dust. He looks in the waste basket. Wadded up candy wrappers. The bed by the window is neatly made. Deckard looks under it, then runs his hands along both sides of the mattress. The closet. There's one suit in it. He pats it down. Nothing. A show box on the floor. He stoops, takes out what looks like a pen from his pocket and care- fully traces it over the box. Assured of its harm- lessness, he lifts off the lid. It contains a little stack of photos bound with a rubber band. Deckard removes them, goes to the lamp by the balcony window and turns it on. A touching collection of family snapshots. The kind of anonymous stuff sold by the bunch in dusty junk shops. The family dog. Junior on the pony squinting in the sun. Uncle Ben clowning with the kids. The faded polaroid of Christmas morning. Simple pictures of simple folks celebrating the family bond. A curious collection for the likes of Leon and Deckard studies them with interest.}
<LOC>__{EXT. STREET BELOW - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Oblivious to the cloudburst, a blue-eyed albino stands in the doorway, peddling candy and artificial flowers looking like he'd never been touched by the light of day. Leon is standing behind him, staring up at his room, watching Deckard at the window. He's still wearing his coveralls, but he looks different. His face is more intent, smarter and angry.}
<LOC>__{EXT. STREET BELOW - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{For one seething moment it looks like Leon might mash something, but suddenly he swings away and disappears into the crowd.}
<LOC>__{INT. LEON'S ROOM - NIGHT}

<LOC>__{EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Leon's got a neck like a fire hydrant and legs to match, but he's a graceful runner. Looks like he could do it for days. And he could. He's put a lot of alley behind him and he's not out of breath.}

<ACTION>__{Slowing down he cuts into an opening and comes out onto a narrow street. The Asian Quarter.}
<LOC>__{INT. CHOP SUEY HOUSE - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{A seamy as well as steamy little place. Counter and small tables. Old slant-eyed enders humped over their fuming bowls jabbering and slurping. The only voice coming out clear is from the big three- D TV on the back wall. As the mellow-mouthed TV announcer delivers the message, a Latin-looking beauty in a well-fitted maids uniform does a twirl, flashes a beguiling smile and glides OUT OF FRAME.}

<DIAL>__{To use as personal body servant to tireless field hand -- the custom tailored humanoid robot, designed especially for your needs.}
<ACTION>__{The Chinese are paying no attention, but the man and the woman seated at the table by the window are. The woman is pretty, a touch of gray in her hair, kind and blue-eyed. MARY looks like an American dream mom, right out of "Father Knows Best." The man also resembles a tradition: the gym instructor, short cropped hair with the body of a drill sergeant, but the eyes are grey and chilling. ROY BATTY is a presence of force with a lazy, but acute sense of what goes on around him. Leon has just come through the door behind them. Try- ing not to be the bull in a china shop, he approaches their table and kneels . Batty doesn't bother to look at him, which amplifies the note of sarcasm in his quiet voice.}

<DIAL>__{Enjoy the view.}
<ACTION>__{From the pot on the table, Mary pours tea and they sit so quiet and still in this noisy place that they seem almost invisible. The view they're "enjoying" is through the window. Outside the neon side in the win- dow directly across the street says: HANNIBAL CHEW,}
<ACTION_ALT>__{MEMBERS.}
<LOC>__{INT. HANNIBAL CHEW'S SHOP - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Chew is a spindly old man of precision, his veiled eyes are shrewd and Chinese, but the rest of him looks like a Charles Dickens invention. He's got a jewelers' glass stuck in his eye, lurched over a lamp, squinting at something in his hand. After a moment his lips peal back into a sour, belligerent smile.}
<CHAR>__{CHEW} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, you're right. This little honey has a couple of defective cones.}
<ACTION>__{He snaps off the lamp and swings round to face his client. SEBASTIAN'S face is almost young, but something has gone too far, too fast. Premature old age has made his bones brittle and his co-ordination slow. The house may be dark but there's a light on in it. Se- bastian is a closet genius.}

<CHAR>__{CHEW} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<ACTION>__{Chew snickers and beckons. Sebastian follows his down a high narrow hall to a heavy insulated door. There's a moth-eaten full length fur coat hanging by it. Chew tugs it on and they go through. The big door slams shut behind them.}
<LOC>__{INT. COLD STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Except for the work table with its sharp gleaming in- struments, the room is as barren and sterile as a morgue. The glass-doored compartments in the walls look like crypts. Some of them small as post office boxes. From one of the Chew removes a vacuum, packed box. Carefully separating the seal, he reaches into the purple jell and with a pair of tweezers extracts an eye. Through the jeweler's glass, which he has not bothered to remove, Chew holds the eye up to the light and studies it a moment. His other hand searches through his pockets.}
<CHAR>__{CHEW} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You got a pocket-charger, boy?}
<ACTION>__{Quick to accommodate, Sebastian removes a pencil-like device from a row of such things in his breast pocket and steps closer. The back of the eye is touched with the pencil and the pupil moves. Suddenly its staring back at them.}
<CHAR>__{CHEW} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Is that good enough for your customer?}
<ACTION>__{Anxious to leave, Sebastian nods. Chew reseals the eye taking his time. He can afford to, he's wearing his coat.}

A bizarre place on a Friday night, hawkers and whores, the rabble, the poor and the cur- ious mill around the randy-built platforms and brightly lit stands. Zhora, in just a raincoat, is not out of place in this flea market atmosphere. Trying not to run, she slices through the mob as quickly as she can. Deckard is not far behind, dodging and side-stepping, trying to move against the tide of people scurrying for shelter. She comes to an intersection and turns out of the mall onto a less crowded street. She glances over her shoulder as she breaks into a run and runs right into a couple of pedestrians. All three go down. Deckard comes out of the crowd in time to spot her get- ting to her feet. She sees him and runs. The two ped- estrians are in his line of fire. He runs past them and drops to one knee, leveling his laser.}

With his bottom lip between his teeth, it hurts to move so fast, Deckard jack-legs it into the street and jumps in front of the first car coming. It screeches to a stop. Deckard scrambles for the door, but the guy be- hind the wheel has other ideas. He peels out fast. The next car slows down and swerves trying not to hit him. Deckard goes for the door and before the old ma- tron inside can lock it, Deckard's yanked it open and jumps in. She screams as he pushes her into the pas- senger seat and jams the car into a wrenching about face. The lady squeals like a pig as the momentum plasters her against the door. Deckard slams it around the corner and guns it down the street. It's long and it's empty and it's going by fast. Nothing the old lady cares to see -- she's got her hands over her eyes, whimpering, hoping she'll faint before she dies. Deckard takes the next left so hard he almost lays it over. As the car bounces off the curb he floors it. Zhora's a hundred yards ahead, halfway down the street, trying to make it back into the crowded mall. She's running fast, but the car is faster. As he passes her, Deckard hits the brakes and skids broadside seventy feet. The door flies open and he rolls out FIRING. Zhora's ducking it with no where to go, except... The showcase window on her left EXPLODES as she crashes through. It's a corner shop joined to a series of stores, front- ing the mall. Deckard runs to the opening she's made and pours FIRE through the tunnel of her jagged wake as Zhora breaks through one window after another, getting sliced, getting shot, trying to get away from Deckard's laser. But she doesn't. His last shot burns a hole through the base of her skull. It kills her but doesn't stop her. Her speed takes what's left of her through the last two windows and into the street where she runs into a parked car with such force that she embeds herself in the side of it. Hunched over, breathing hard, Deckard comes slowly for- ward. The crowd starting to gather. There's something for everybody and they're coming from all directions. Deckard moves through them, edging to have a look. It's not a good thing to see. It looks like Salome and the car tries to eat each other. A bloody feast of metal and flesh.

It's Mr. Deetchum, the old watchman. That RUSTLING SOUND are rats who were feeding on him, scampering for safer places, Deckard gets to his feet. The stairway rectangles ten stories up.

She dangles a few feet off the floor, hung by the shoulders through rings suspended from the ceiling. Her head is slung forward, her body limp and slightly swaying. Deckard pushes open one of the doors until it touches the wall. Slowly, he advances toward the hanging figure, keeping an eye on the mirror to cover surprises from the door. He's not breathing hard. His heart isn't pound- ing. Deckard's in his element. Close enough to look up into her face, he stops. It isn't grisly death that causes the reaction in his eyes. It's the innocence of her angel face. It's not something he has time to consider. In the mirror behind him, he sees the door starting to open. Deckard spins. He shouldn't have. Pris' legs snap up, crack the laser out of his hand and clamp around his neck. Slowly, the door swings closed, but Deckard doesn't notice. His carotid artery is no longer sending blood to the brain.

He goes back to the floor, gagging for air. Oh-so-precisely she reaches out with a long index finger and flips the switch on the machine. It's a flab eliminator with a vibrator belt. Normally an innocuous piece of equipment, but the motor housing on this one is missing. Lots of GRINDING METAL. A bad place for flesh and bone. But that's where Deckard's hand is going. An eight- year-old against a full-down man. In two more seconds his hand will be ground round. Deckard tries to pull his hand loose. It won't come. He yanks hard, but it's welded in hers. His face is twisted and strained as he raises a leg, wedges his foot against her chest and pushes with all his might. The hold breaks. They topple back. Deckard hits the floor gulping to catch his breath. Pris is up and coming for him again. She hovers over him. Deckard rolls out of the way as she comes down like a pile driver. Reflexively Deckard raises his arm to protect himself. Pris just smiles, takes hold of his foot and drags him across the floor. She doesn't like to leave a piece of work unfinished. They're going back to the machine. He goes by a weight-stand of dumbbells and grabs hold. It doesn't stop him. He's sliding over the floor like it was ice, weight stand in tow. Pris gets to the machine, yanks his foot up and forces it toward the opening. Deckard sits up, a five-pound dumbbell in his hand, and clobbers her in the back. It knocks her off balance, but she doesn't let go of his foot. She hooks out with a fist but misses. He gets her with a roundhouse in the face. She goes to the floor and Deckard's up, the dumbbell over his head, coming down with it. Fighting for her life now, Pris drives a foot into his chest. It lifts him off the floor. He flies back across the gym and lands in a heap. No more games. Pris is furious and moving fast. She rips a steel bar out of the wall and, holding it over- head, charges him like a samurai. As she comes down for the kill, she freezes. Deckard landed near the laser. He crawls towards it. As in a nightmare, it takes forever. But he gets there. He reaches out and grabs the laser, rolls over and takes careful aim. She charges towards him, screaming her rage. He FIRES as she comes. The shot amputates her left arm at the shoulder, but her hand doesn't let go of the bar. It dangles crazily in front of her as she charges forward. He PUTS THE NEXT ONE through her neck. Pris hiccups a rope of blood as she flies through the air and crashes next to Deckard. Dead. He lies next to her, chest heaving. Slowly he rolls over and gets to his hands and knees. Panting, he stag- gers to his feet and stands over her, swaying slightly. The sound that escapes his throat is raspy and dry. It might not sound like a war cry, but it is.}

He kicks the door open and dives through head first and hits the floor in a roll, POURING FIRE into the far corners of the room but the room is empty. There's a kitchen bar, a closet and a bedroom door, both closed. Deckard's breathing is the only sound. No response from either door. Maybe it was a sound, maybe intuition, but suddenly Deckard twists around and FIRES several shots into the closet. The smouldering door slowly creaks open. Mary is huddled in the rear of the closet. Her hand out like somebody about to catch a ball but afraid of it. In her other hand she clutches a button-eyed monkey. Her face is bewildered, frozen in fear, her body riddled with holes. No recognition gap here. Deckard SHOOTS her through the neck to make sure. Mary falls to the floor, like a puppet with her strings cut. Deckard backs away from the pathetic figure in the closet and sits on the sofa, unable to take his eyes off her. Deckard lays the laser down next to him, holds out his hand and looks at it. It's steady. He drops it in his lap, closes his eyes and leans back. A TAPPING from the ceiling. Deckard looks up. A KNOCK -- with the proverbial DOUBLE RAP at the end. A pause. Deckard jumps out of the way as the ceiling gives in. Chucks on concrete and plaster hit the couch where he was sitting.

<ACTION>__{Deckard comes out onto the landing. Taking his time, he climbs the steps to the next floor, the last floor. He SHOOTS the hinges out of the big stairwell door, pushes it with his foot and it comes down with a BANG. The REVERBERATIONS turn into silence. The corridor is empty.}

<DIAL>__{This is how we do it up there, lad! Come on!}
<ACTION>__{In a blue of lightning-like action, Batty whips down the hall, zigzagging off the walls towards Deckard so fast that Deckard gets only three SHOTS off before the blur crashes through the wall on his left with a laugh. Deckard stands there a moment -- digesting the impact of it, then edges up to the gaping wall. Batty is be- hind him. He knees Deckard in the back and slaps him in the head. Deckard goes to his knees, then over on his face. Batty kneels next to him.}

<DIAL>__{That's the spirit.}
<ACTION>__{Like a matador, Batty walks away. By the time Deckard's on his feet, Batty's disappeared through one of the doors. Deckard wipes the blood from his mouth, bends down and picks up his laser, reloads and looks down the hall, towards the jeering voice.}

<ACTION>__{Deckard stares back at him, but doesn't respond. Sud- denly fury storms through Batty. He throws Deckard out the door, knocking him down, grabs him by the collar and rams his head into the wall.}

<ACTION>__{Betty walks off and disappears through one of the doors. Deckard gets to his knees, leans against the wall a mo- ment, then punches it with his fist. On his feet he's a little wobbly. Holding his breath so he can hear above his own breathing, he listens. No sound. No sign of Batty. The laser is laying nearby. He doesn't bother. Deckard is backing down the hall, quiet as he can. He had a job to do. He would like to have done it, but he's not insane. He gets to the landing and turns. On the first step down, he stops. Batty's on the land- ing below, looking up at him.}

He gets one SHOT off be- fore Batty's got his hand. There's a hole over Batty's right eye. Blood running down his face, dripping on Deckard. The right side of his face isn't working too good. The corner of his mouth doesn't quite shut -- his voice comes out slurred, a little hollow.}
<CHAR>__{BATTY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{Ah!}
<ACTION>__{He reaches out and pinches something. His lips compress as he yanks it out of the wall. It's a ten-penny nail. He holds it out to Deckard and drops it. Deckard catches it.}

<ACTION>__{Deckard springs to his feet and bolts. But instead of going for the stairwell he turns in the first available door.}
<LOC>__{INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT #2 - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Provocation accomplished. Batty smiles and walks lei- surely towards the door. Deckard's terrified scream and the SOUND of GLASS CRASHING stop him. Batty speeds up and moves into the room. The window pane is splattered, curtains sucked out, bellowing in the wind.}
<CHAR>__{BATTY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Crap.}
<ACTION>__{He walks up to the window. Deckard comes away from the wall, inching up behind him, laser in both hands, aimed at the base of Batty's skull. Batty starts to lean over, but even before his eyes see the pavement, he knows. He spins... Deckard FIRES again. This one goes home. Batty falls like he was poleaxed, hits the floor dead weight. Deckard starts to tremble. His arms go limp as his head tilts back and he closes his eyes. He can breathe again. On the floor, Batty's hand is crawling toward Deckard's ankle. With the unsuspected abruptness of a man slipping on a banana peel, Deckard comes down. Face knotted in hor- ror, he EMPTIES THE LASER in Batty's body -- but the hand holds on. With a screech of frustration he drops the laser and like an animal claws at Batty's dead fingers -- but the fingers are welded shut. Deckard starts to crawl, pulling Batty behind him. He struggled through the door and stumbles to his feet.}
<LOC>__{INT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Deckard plunges down the corridor dragging Batty along. He falls, gets to one foot, falls again and crawls the last couple feet to the stairwell.}
<LOC>__{INT. TENTH FLOOR STAIRWELL - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Groaning, he tugs and pulls, hauls and heaves Batty's body to the edge of the landing. He pauses for breath, then lays back, wedging his feet against Batty's shoul- ders and pushes. Inch by inch the body goes over the edge. Then all at once it drops. But the hand holds and the weight of the body takes Deckard with it. As Deckard slides over the edge, he grabs hold of the railing. Deckard's hanging three hundred feet over the basement floor, supporting himself and Batty's corpse -- almost four hundred pounds of stress on his fingers. With his free foot he chops away at Batty's hand, try- ing to break it loose. But it's not working. Deckard's fingers are starting to slip. His face is a mask of agony as he wedges his heel over Batty's thumb. With the help of gravity and everything he's got in his right leg to push with, he pushes. The thumb breaks loose. Batty falls. The SOUND OF HIS BODY HITTING BELOW sounds good, but Deckard doesn't notice. He's in an awkward position. He must reverse the way he's facing to pull himself up. He lets go with his right hand and crosses it over the left. Then turns the left around so he's got an over- hand grip. Like a man doing his last pull-up... the one that can't be done, Deckard pulls himself up, throws a foot over the edge and grapples and heaves and wiggled himself onto the cold solid steel of the stairwell landing. And lies there, body jerking spasmodically, slowly clenching and unclenching his cramped hand, but it's his burning cheek against the cool metal he's most aware of. Dizzy, hot, lungs on fire, he stands -- and putting one foot in front of the other, Deckard descends the stairs.}
<LOC>__{EXT. SEBASTIAN'S BUILDING - DAWN}
<ACTION>__{Slowly the door pushes open and Deckard comes out into the morning. The sun isn't yet risen, but the sky has begun to pale. It's a brooding gray stew of a dawn not very pretty, but even though he can't show it, Deckard is glad to see it. For a moment he tilts his head back and takes some breath, then walks across the courtyard towards the street, so dead on his feet he hasn't the energy to fall. Deckard slumps into the shelter of his car. The col- lapses on the front seat.}
<LOC>__{INT. DECKARD'S BEDROOM - DAWN}
<ACTION>__{In a corner of the dimness Deckard sits slumped on a chair, facing the pearly gray light of the window. The only SOUND in the room is the soft steady BREATHING that comes from the bed. Quietly he gets up and walks over to her. Rachael lies sleeping, one delicate arm exposed from under the sheet. Deckard stands there, bettered and grim, staring down at her. Moments go by and finally he sits gently on the edge of the bed. Rachael opens her eyes, and looks up at him, she smiles.}

The crisp, blue-white snow underfoot melted through in spots exposing soggy patches of rich brown earth. Rachael stops and faces him. Her lips are parted, her warm breath turning the cold air to vapor. Looking lithe and fragile by these barren-rooted trees, she stands in the crisp white snow looking at Deckard. Nothing in her retreats, even now her eyes insist on knowing.}
<LOC>__{EXT. WOODS - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Deckard walking over the snow. Alone. He walks slowly, mechanically through the cold, unaffected by it. His gaunt face, empty of expression except for the tears running down his pale cheeks. But for the SQUEAK of his wet shoes over the crusted snow, there is no sound. And Deckard recedes into the silence of the freezing white landscape.}

She said the great advantage of being alive was to have a choice. And she chose. And a part of me was almost glad. Not because she was gone but because this way they could never touch her. As for Tyrell -- he was murdered, but he wasn't dead. For a long time I wanted to kill him. But what was the point? There were too many Tyrells. But only one Rachael. Maybe real and unreal could never be separated. The secret never found. But I got as close with her as I'd ever come to it. She'd stay with me a long time. I guess we made each other real.}
