<L>__{interior mornay's castle night}
<A>__{mornay, in an opulent bedchamber hung with tapestries and carpeted with eastern rugs, lies in bed, tossing in the restless sleep of a tortured soul. he thinks he hears galloping. in subliminal flashes he dreams of wallace riding toward him. he wakes, and listens to a strange noise. it is hoofbeats! coming closer. he hears shouts too, screams from below and those strange, approaching hoofbeats... wallace, on horseback rides up the circular stairs inside mornay's castle! his horse bounds up the stone mornay's guards are behind him, on foot, pursuing. at a landing, wallace cuts down a guard, and gallops higher. in his bed, mornay sits up gawking as the door explodes inward and wallace rides through! mornay is frozen. wallace slashes him down. out in the corridor, the guards gather; they have wallace trapped. he covers the horse's eyes with a cloth and spurs his flanks. the blind animal runs through the window!}
