<L>__{exterior stauffenberg home bamberg dusk}
<A>__{est. the sound of children at play takes us to:}
<L>__{exterior stauffenberg home back lawn continuous}
<A>__{once again, the scene idyllic. the stauffenberg children play football in the distance. stauffenberg himself is out of uniform for the first time since the hospital, but he does not seem relaxed. nina sits across from him, half reading a book, half talking to her husband. stauffenberg cannot hear a word she is saying he is miles away. he looks over at his children. one would never suspect that germany has waged a calamitous war and that the country is facing total devastation.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{...after that i thought i'd take the children to the country for a few days to see my claus?}
<A>__{he snaps out of his thoughts. "hmmm?"}
<C>__{nina }
<D>__{have you heard a word i said?}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{the country...}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{nina. listen. i want you to delay your trip. just for a while.}
<A>__{she wants to ask, he wants to tell her. finally:}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{does this have something to do with... your work?}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{i would just be more comfortable knowing where you are until i'm back from berlin. things will be different then. i promise.}
<A>__{long pause. once again, a couple who know each other well enough to not have to say things plainly. nina is worried but strong.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{how long until... until we see you?}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{a few days. if all goes well. then we can travel as a family.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{and if things... don't go well?}
<A>__{he hesitates.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{i love you, nina.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{and i love you... what }
<C>__{children}
<P>__{papa, come and play with us. (etc.)}
<A>__{the children kick the ball toward stauffenberg the one sport he can play. he is about to say something to nina, but she cuts him off.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{go be with your children.}
<A>__{stauffenberg stands, touching nina's cheek and kissing her forehead. we stay on her as he joins the children. she watches them play together, seeing her husband laughing for the first time in a long while. her eyes well with tears a mixture of happiness and anguish. too good to last, too much to bear.}
