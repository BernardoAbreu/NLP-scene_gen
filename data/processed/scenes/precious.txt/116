<A>__{the bug lady casually points to the exit. the large ferocious woman heads for the exit with abdul in one arm and precious' bag in the other. she looks down at abdul making "baby" faces and sounds. precious dashes after her but winces in pain grabbing her pelvic area along the way. the bug lady follows precious as a speed walker might. precious snatches abdul and promptly knees the ferocious woman hard in the gut. the ferocious woman moans as she falls to the ground. precious continues kicking and stomping her without abandon. the bug girl observes stoically. abdul wails. as she trounces the woman, precious' eyes fill with a rage we haven't yet seen. finally, two other women pull precious away while she still kicks at the woman. the ferocious woman, now bloodied, falls over on her back with her eyes closed and her mouth hanging open.}
