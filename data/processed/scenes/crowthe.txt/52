<A>__{new angle eric at vanity later. he's wearing white pancake makeup on his cheeks. shaky. flash: eric sucks up funboy's gunshots in the chest. 1 2 3 4.}

<B>__{resuming eric at vanity}
<A>__{his face a crazy warpaint maze of white streaks, not blended yet. he looks at his own reflection. in one cracked, triangular facet of the mirror is not a multiple of his face, but the skull cowboy. just one.}
<C>__{skull cowboy}
<D>__{glad to see you're finally with the program.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{bugger off to the graveyard, skull face, i'm busy.}
<C>__{skull cowboy}
<D>__{you work for the dead. forget that, and you can forget it all.}
<A>__{the cowboy tips his hat and isn't there. eric sees the crow perched on the edge of the mirror now.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{forget this.}
<A>__{he smears the streaks until his face is uniformly grave wave white. angle gabriel the cat coming in to sniff around the clutter at the foot of the vanity. eric looks down towards him... and toward the lipstick he dropped. close up eric's hand as it glides down to pick up the lipstick. contact, and flash: eric, smashed on the street, t bird's car b.g., upside down in eric's pov as he rolls over and blood courses from both corners of his mouth, a definite foreshadow of the "crow" face.}
