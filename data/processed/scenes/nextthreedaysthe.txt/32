<L>__{interior courtroom a short time later}
<A>__{john sits on a bench, pale and shaken, flipping through the ruling. the courtroom is empty, save a bailiff eating at his desk. during this he gets up and walks out past them.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{but what if we find the woman who was leaving the parking lot?}
<C>__{meyer}
<D>__{the pcra was rejected. no new evidence can be submitted. not anymore.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{it was a robbery! someone stole her purse!}
<C>__{meyer}
<D>__{and if they'd used her credit cards we would have had something to argue. i'm sorry; this really...sucks.}
<A>__{john offers a smile at meyer's unlawyer like choice of words.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{so, that's it. now we just have the supreme court.}
<C>__{meyer}
<D>__{john, in the last thirty years, the supreme court hasn't heard one murder case. no decent lawyer would even file the pleadings.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{so, i need to find an indecent one?}
<C>__{meyer}
<D>__{no, i'm going to file it. but i need you to do something for me.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{anything.}
<C>__{meyer}
<D>__{i need you to look at the evidence and just forget lara is your wife.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(stopped by that)}
<D>__{i've seen the evidence, meyer.}
<C>__{meyer}
<D>__{i'm not saying judge her innocent or guilty, i'm just saying look at it. he co worker sees her leaving the scene, she has the victim's blood on her clothes, her fingerprints on the murder weapon }
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(is this a bad joke?)}
<D>__{we went out for dinner! how do you do that after you kill somebody? she would have to be a psychopath!}
<C>__{meyer}
<D>__{ and the fight in the office.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{everyone fights with their boss!}
<C>__{meyer}
<D>__{but this one ended up dead.}
<A>__{john looks at meyer anew, feeling profoundly betrayed.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{so, you never believed she was innocent?}
<C>__{meyer}
<D>__{how can you say that?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{so, what are you saying, meyer?!}
<C>__{meyer}
<D>__{that it no longer matters what we believe; lara's not getting out. and you have no idea how much i hate saying that.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(exiting)}
<D>__{i will find someone to file the pleadings.}
<C>__{meyer}
<D>__{john! come on! for christ's sake. john!!}
<A>__{john is long gone. meyer hurls his sandwich into the trash.}
