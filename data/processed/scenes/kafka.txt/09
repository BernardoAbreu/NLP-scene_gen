<T>__{cut:}
<A>__{near the front door later smoke heavier in the air, the coffee house more crowded with strange groups of characters. kafka and his friends preparing to leave.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{the cabaret will be packed this time of night we'll never get in.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{well, it has to be the cabaret because there's nowhere else to go.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{home, i think.}
<C>__{julius}
<A>__{home ?}
<C>__{margaret}
<P>__{(head on ernst's shoulder)}
<D>__{you know i can't stay up late.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{home is the last resort }
<B>__{bizzlebek}
<A>__{the owner of the voice. a man sitting at the bar nearby, turning on his stool to face them. a dissipated dandy of a man.}
<C>__{ernst}
<P>__{(introducing him)}
<D>__{ do you know bizzlebek the gravedigger?}
<C>__{bizzlebek}
<A>__{stonecutter , if you please.}
<C>__{margarete}
<A>__{sculptor , if only he'd admit it.}
<C>__{bizzlebek}
<D>__{no one should admit being an artist unless they're paid for it. if you go to the cabaret mention my name they'll find a table for you.}
<A>__{turning round again.}
<C>__{ernst}
<D>__{bizzlebek has ways and means denied lesser mortals. it comes from working in the cemetery all day he's able to transcent the physical world.}
<A>__{bizz1ebek turns round again, with a bored sign.}
<C>__{bizzlebek}
<D>__{no it only makes me view people dispassionately as so many ... slabs.}
<A>__{he looks about, characterizing various coffee house types:}
<C>__{bizzlebek}
<D>__{quartz ... slate ... gravel ... granite ... flint ...}
<P>__{(and then)}
<D>__{marble.}
<A>__{it's gabriela from the office. kafka is surprised to see her, instinctively walking over to where she's sitting at a far table.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{my god, look, he's marching forward willingly to make human contact.}
<A>__{anna smiles. she's interested in kafka. (which means we must see this warm attractive girl as a threat, a curse, a trap!)}
<B>__{gabriela}
<A>__{ on the other hand, is an enticement. kafka can't help walking towards her. sitting with her own friends, though there is something less than friendly about them. two men, two women.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<P>__{(as kafka comes over)}
<D>__{hello again.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{i've never seen you here before.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<D>__{have you looked?}
<A>__{kafka feels as awkward as she knows he feels. he looks to her friends, expecting an introduction, but no one makes a move.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{well nice to know life exists outside the office.}
<C>__{gabriela}
<P>__{(ironic)}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{kafka nods goodbye and walks away, berating himself for banality.}
