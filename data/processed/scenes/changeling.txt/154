<A>__{gordon races up one rooftop, over the top, then leaps to the next one as, below, mounties race to keep up with him, whistles blowing furiously. he looks behind him to see the other two mounties running rooftop to rooftop, coming fast. gordon runs faster, going at angles to put more distance between himself and the police on the ground...and making increasingly more difficult and dangerous leaps from rooftop to rooftop. he leaps across one chasm, barely makes it, keeps running. the rooftop mounties follow. one of them makes the jump successfully, but the other falls short, plummeting to the ground three stories below. a leg snaps on impact. the first mountie hesitates, looks down. the second one waves him on.}
<C>__{second mountie}
<D>__{go on! get the bastard!}
<A>__{he nods and continues the chase. gordon runs for all he's worth. the mountie keeps after him. gordon makes another leap. the mountie jumps...but he's short. he grabs onto a rain gutter. gordon sees his situation, runs back, and stomps on the mountie's hands, trying to get him to shake loose. the gutter starts to tear free when a mountie down below fires at gordon, making him back off. the mountie clinging to the gutter starts to fall, then grabs a nearby pipe and crawls up to the roof. keeps coming. gordon keeps running...but comes to a chasm too wide to be jumped. he hesitates, starts to cut back in another direction when the mountie tackles him hard. the two go down in a tangle of limbs, fighting, punching, kicking. changeling a true story they slide down the steeply angled roof and barely avoid going over the edge. with nowhere else to run, gordon fights for all he's got, the punches from both coming fast and furious. finally, the mountie backs off just a bit }
<C>__{mountie}
<D>__{screw this...i'm too old for this fightin' shit....}
<A>__{ and dives at gordon, taking them both off the edge of the two story roof and down into a garden below, crashing through carefully manicured flowers and trees to land with a thud, the mountie's impact cushioned by gordon. as the other mounties come on the run, the first one staggers to his feet and yanks up a bruised, bleeding but otherwise intact gordon. looks at him nose to nose.}
<C>__{mountie}
<D>__{you...are under...arrest!}
<A>__{and he yanks gordon toward the other waiting officers.}
