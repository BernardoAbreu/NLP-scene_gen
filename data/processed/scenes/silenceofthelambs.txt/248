<A>__{moving angle towards the front door, as frustrated hrt cops file out of the empty house, rifles slung across their shoulders.}
<B>__{we pick out crawford}
<A>__{walking across the grass towards the van, when all at once he stops in his tracks, shaken by a sudden flash of intuition.}

<A>__{clarice, pulling her notebook from her shoulder bag, glances around the musty looking room.}
<C>__{mr. gumb }
<D>__{that horrible business, i shiver every time i think about it...}
<A>__{overstuffed furniture, porcelain figurines. one archway onto the front hall, another onto a dining alcove, and through there, the kitchen. mr. gumb is crossing to a rolling desk, raising the top. he bends over, begins poking through cubby holes. his tone is casual, neutral.}
<C>__{mr. gumb}
<D>__{are they close to catching somebody, do you think?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{i think we may be, yes.}
<A>__{mr. gumb stiffens, almost imperceptibly. his back is to her, as he continues opening drawers, rustling papers.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{mr. gordon, did you take over this place after mrs. lippman died?}
<C>__{mr. gumb}
<D>__{yes. i bought the house from her, two years ago.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{did she leave any records here? tax or business records? maybe a list of employees?}
<A>__{close on mr. gumb's back as he continues his rummaging.}
<C>__{mr. gumb}
<D>__{no, nothing at all. has the fbi learned something? because the police here don't seem to have the first clue...}
<A>__{out of the folds of his kimono crawls a death's head moth. it creeps slowly to the center of his back, raising its wings.}
<C>__{mr. gumb}
<D>__{do you have his description yet, or some fingerprints...?}
<B>__{clarice}
<A>__{unaware, is still glancing around the room. for several agonizing moments, we think she won't see the moth but then she turns, does see it, and her eyes freeze. a beat of pure fear. a tremendous struggle to keep her voice calm.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{no... no, we don't.}
<A>__{very carefully, she drops her notebook back into her bag, lowers the bag to the floor. with her fingertips she brushes back the edge of her blazer, loosening its drape.}
<B>__{mr. gumb}
<A>__{turns back towards her cheerfully, holding out a business card.}
<C>__{mr. gumb}
<D>__{ahhh. here's that number.}
<B>__{clarice}
<A>__{keeps her distance. they are about ten feet apart.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{good, thank you. mr. gordon, do you have a phone i can use?}
<B>__{mr. gumb}
<A>__{is about to reply when the moth suddenly flies up from behind him, flutters past his face. he turns, looking at it. he looks back at clarice, his mouth still open.}
<B>__{her eyes}
<A>__{are unmoving, locked on his.}
<B>__{his eyes}
<A>__{stare back at her, widen. and they know each other.}
<C>__{mr. gumb}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{in the kitchen. i will show you.}
<B>__{clarice}
<A>__{whips her gun out, gripping it in both shaking hands.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{freeze!}
<B>__{mr. gumb}
<A>__{slowly tilts his head to one side, smiles at her.}
<B>__{clarice}
<A>__{tries to force more authority into her voice.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{okay... okay, mr. gumb, you're under arrest. down on the floor, hands and legs spread, move it.}
<B>__{mr. gumb}
<A>__{turns, then all at once, in two quick steps, he is gone, disappearing into his dining alcove, then kitchen.}
<B>__{clarice}
<A>__{hesitates, just a split second, to shoot him in the back and then it's too late.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{shit!}
