<A>__{comanches are running from the tepees, trying to reach their horse herd as the file of rangers knifes in. the bark of hand guns is a steady sound now and the comanches have never been up against such marksmen. one charging ranger rides down a tepee. another, with two guns drawn, scores a running double on two indians racing toward him from opposite sides of his fast running horse. a dodging comanche screams as a barrel chested roan hits him broadside and sends him sprawling into the embers of the campfire.}
