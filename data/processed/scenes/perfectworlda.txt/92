<L>__{interior friendly's day}
<A>__{a small, well organized country dry goods store with a dozen or so aisles carrying everything from ddt to used boots. a long counter at the front of the store is backed by a small office with a large glass window that gives the manager, mr. willits, 45, bespectacled, anal retentive, a clear view of the store. a nuclear family with two kids exits the store just as butch and phillip enter. butch holds the door open and smiles at them. they say "thanks" but can't help but notice phillip, cowering behind butch, still clad in his underwear. he hides behind a nearby display which reads: cast your vote for friendly's friendliest clerk! a clerk, lucy, 30, holding a handful of shoeboxes notices their entrance. she's schoolmarmish with a smile that looks like it's painted on.}
