<A>__{cole and lynn ride home with a back seat full of groceries. cole finishes off a cherry popsicle as he watches out the window. lynn looks over.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{let's rent a movie.}
<A>__{cole bites off the last of the popsicle and glances at his mom.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{your pick.}
<A>__{cole stares at his mom quietly.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{it can even have jean claude van damme in it if you want.}
<A>__{cole smiles at that. he nods, "yes" joyfully. his smile fades away as he notices his mother fiddling with the heater controls. cole gazes out the front windshield as the car moves towards home. suddenly a piece of paper sticks to the windshield. it's a page from a playbill. a 1941 playbill. it flies away revealing a woman in a flowing flowery dress from the 40's suddenly walks into the middle of the street as the pages of her playbill swirl in the air.}

<D>__{momma, look out!}
<A>__{the woman in the flowery dress turns. her hand rests on her stomach. we see she is pregnant. playbills stick to the windshield obstructing the view. lynn slams the brakes... too late. the woman smashes into the front grill of the car... her terror }
<B>__{stricken face comes over the hood and crashes right through the windshield in a shower of blood and glass... cole screams. lynn screams... the car screeches to a stop in the middle of a congested intersection.}
<A>__{the line of cars behind them suddenly hit their brakes and swerve to one side avoiding a mass collision. after a few seconds, the entire intersection has come to a halt. cole who has shut his eyes... slowly opens them. he looks around fearfully. his eyes move to the windshield. no broken glass. no blood. and no woman. cole looks out through the pristine windshield onto the street where cars are stopped and staring all around them. cole slowly looks over to his mother. he finds her staring at him in complete and utter disbelief. her hands clutch the wheel. the whites of her knuckles showing her fear. she has no idea why he screamed.}
