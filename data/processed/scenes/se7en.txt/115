<L>__{interior apartment 604 night}
<A>__{mills is in a dark mood. he and dr. o'neill stand by a woman who hangs by a noose from the ceiling. the woman's head has been bandaged sloppily with white gauze and tape. her eyes have been left uncovered. the gauze is stained red in small spots. the woman hangs low, so her feet are inches from the floor where piles of dried flowers and a cordless telephone lay. there's a chair knocked over behind her. o'neill's going through his black bag. a violet, velvet curtain has been draped on the wall in the corner, behind a full length mirror. the mirror reflects the corpse. a seven pointed star is smeared in lipstick on the mirror's surface, with the words i did not kill her, she was given a choice below. somerset enters from the bathroom, looks at the murder display.}

<A>__{somerset nods. he walks to a dresser. the woman's purse sits open and somerset extracts her driver's license. he looks at the photo. the woman in the picture is beautiful.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{you can see what he did.}
<A>__{o'neill steps up to the woman. he brandishes dull scissors. the captain enters with two uniform cops. he looks around, grim, clenching his jaw.}

<D>__{cut her up... dressed the wounds. he put the noose around her neck and stood her on the chair.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{she had the telephone.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{call for help, and you'll live. but, you'll be mutilated.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{or, kick out the chair, and spare yourself a lifetime of hideousness.}
<A>__{o'neill's cutting the bandages on the woman's face. he pulls them away in front. mills looks, disgusted by the sight. somerset sits in a chair, runs his fingers through his hair.}
<C>__{o'neill}
<D>__{he cut off her nose to spite her face. and he did it very recently.}
<C>__{captain}
