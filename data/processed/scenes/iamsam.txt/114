<A>__{hyped on coffee, sam is zooming around and he's a mess. shirt hangs out, coffee stains on it, his hair wild. frazzled, he forgets to put the lid on the blender and turns it on. a mint mocha frappuccino splatters him in the face. at that moment, george comes out of his office.}

<D>__{no, no, i can't wait. i can't wait. i've got to go right now.}
