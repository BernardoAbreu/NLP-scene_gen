<L>__{interior cabin. day.}
<A>__{they walk into the cabin. camera goes with them. bedroom is dark, shades pulled down. there is an aura of boys' clubhouse secret camaraderie in the following scene:}
<C>__{buck}
<P>__{(as soon as the door is shut; conspiratorially)}
<D>__{it was you or him, wasn't it?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{that guy you killed. you had to, didn't ya?}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(they are protecting each other)}
<D>__{yeah, he put me in a spot, so i had to. he didn't have a chinaman's chance.}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{but you had to }
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{yeah. i had to.}
<C>__{buck}
<P>__{(like two kids keeping a secret from mom)}
<D>__{don't say nothin' to blanche about it.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{hey, that time you broke out of jail, she talk you into goin' back?}
<C>__{buck}
<P>__{(it is obvious he had}
<D>__{hoped clyde hadn't}
<P>__{known about it)}
<D>__{yeah, you hear about that?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{i won't say nothin' to bonnie about it.}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{i appreciate it.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{yeah...say, what d'ya think of bonnie?}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{she's a real peach.}
<A>__{there is now a long pause a lull in the conversation, as if they asked each other all the questions and are now out of things to say. it is too much for buck, the natural enemy of silence, who suddenly claps his hands together and bursts out animatedly:}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{boy, are we gonna have us a good time!}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(matching his merriment)}
<D>__{we surely are!}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{yessir!}
<P>__{(a pause, then:)}
<D>__{what are we gonna do?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{well, how's this i thought we'd all go to missouri. they ain't lookin' for me there. we'll hole up someplace and have us a regular vacation. all right?}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{no trouble, now?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{no trouble. i ain't lookin' to go back to prison.}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{hey, what's this i hear about you cuttin' up your toes, boy?}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(ironically)}
<D>__{that ain't but half of it. i did it so i could get off work detail breakin' those damned rocks with a hammer day and night. sure enough, next week i got paroled. i walked out of that god forsaken jail on crutches.}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{shoot }
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{ain't life grand?}
