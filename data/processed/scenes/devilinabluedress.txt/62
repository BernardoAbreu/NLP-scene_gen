<L>__{interior carter's office}
<A>__{baxter ushers easy into a huge elegantly furnished room more closely resembling a hall than an office with large arched doors and windows leading out onto a stone veranda overlooking a canyon. alone looking out at the greenery on the opposite hillside is todd carter. baxter walks out and speaks with carter, while easy watches them from inside the office. the rich man perks up with interest and hurries inside with baxter who throws easy a dirty look on his way out. he pauses uncertainly wearing a simple sears roebuck looking tan suit with a plain open collared white shirt. the dark circles under his eyes show nights without sleep.}

<C>__{easy}
<D>__{you didn't hire somebody to find your girlfriend?}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{no... until just now i was sure that she was hundreds of miles away from here... you say someone is looking for her?}
<A>__{easy nods, his brow furrowed in thought. carter gets up and walks to the door, looking out into the canyon.}
<C>__{carter}
<P>__{(half to himself)}
<D>__{someone is looking for her.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{what's goin' on between you two?}
<A>__{carter shrugs and stammers nervously.}

<P>__{(then recovering)}
<D>__{uh... that's none of your concern, mr. rawlins.}

<C>__{carter}
<D>__{uh... i can't say i don't know...}
<A>__{he's lying and easy knows it.}
<C>__{carter}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{do you think you could find her again?}

<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{it's important, mr. rawlins, for her sake... i'm willing to pay you.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{mr. carter, why did she leave?}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{i can't tell you any more mr. rawlins i will pay you to find her...}
<A>__{easy thinks about it, and then nods.}

<D>__{good. then they can help us }
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{ no. they can't!}
<A>__{carter is too emphatic and easy waits for him to give more, but instead he turns and gazes out again at the canyon.}
