<L>__{interior german inn late afternoon}
<A>__{a dish of fried eggs and bacon is ordered from a hideous old wench that comes to serve them, in place of the lovely creature which had been expected; and the captain, laughing, says:}
<C>__{captain galgenstein}
<D>__{well, our meal is a frugal one, but a soldier has many a time a worse.}
<A>__{taking off his hat, sword belt, and gloves, with great ceremony, galgenstein sits down to eat. roderick puts his weapons securely on the old chest of drawers where the captain's is laid. the hideous old woman brings in a pot of very sour wine, at which, and at her ugliness, roderick feels a considerable ill humor.}
<C>__{roderick}
<P>__{(when she leaves)}
<D>__{where's the beauty you promised me?}
<C>__{captain galgenstein}
<P>__{(laughing and looking hard at roderick)}
<D>__{it was my joke. i was tired, and did not care to go farther. there's not prettier woman here than that. if she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.}
<A>__{this increases roderick's ill humor.}
<C>__{roderick}
<P>__{(sternly)}
<D>__{upon my word, sir, i think you have acted very coolly.}
<C>__{captain galgenstein}
<D>__{i have acted as i think fit.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{sir, i'm a british officer.}
<C>__{captain galgenstein}
<D>__{it's a lie! you're a deserter! you're an impostor, sir; your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. you pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know. will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{neither!}
<A>__{springing at him like a tiger. but, agile as he is, galgenstein is equally on his guard. he takes two pistols out of his pockets, fires one off, and says, from the other end of the table where he stands dodging roderick, as it were.}
<C>__{captain galgenstein}
<D>__{advance a step, and i send this bullet into your brains!}
<A>__{the door is flung open, and the two sergeants enter, armed with musket and bayonet to aid their captain. the game is up. roderick flings down a knife with which he had armed himself, for the old hag, on bringing in the wine, had removed his sword.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{i volunteer.}
