<A>__{wonderment at the tumult through the open doorway. nina leaves the phone, crosses to the door and kicks it shut in the people's faces with all her strength.}
<C>__{nina}
<P>__{(furious)}
<D>__{you stupid, ignorant bastard! how dare you storm in here like you won me in a raffle?!}
<A>__{cameron, realizing for the first time that instead of being ashamed or frightened, she is livid with rage?}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{my girl gave me her key!}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{i am not your girl! i am that man's girl! that man and i have been lovers for six months! i've known you two days!}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(ironically)}
<D>__{then gee, ma'am, i sure hope you didn't tell him about all that ballin' last night.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{don't you dare be clever with me! he came scratching at the door tonight like a beaten dog, begging me to say that you were some twenty four hour nonsense.}
<P>__{(against her will she starts to cry)}
<D>__{...and i had to tell him i thought i was falling in love with...}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(not giving an inch)}
<D>__{you couldn'a said that with your clothes on?!}
<A>__{nina lets out an incoherent roar of rage.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{goddamn you! the wounded stud! he is entitled to some dignity! to lose his "pure and faithful lover" without the new boy barging in! where do you suppose he is now?}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{did ya look in the laundry hamper?}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{get out! get the hell out!!}
<A>__{cameron crosses to the door. searching through this madness for some kind of logic, turning on her.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{i don't have any rights? i don't have the right to be pissed off...?}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{you don't have the right to breathe! i knew him before i met you! do you understand that?! before i met you!! if we were frightened, we woke each other in the dark...we slept in each other's arms...}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{the word is "fuck!"}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{all right, the word is fuck! you narrow, insensitive, stupid...!}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{don't. don't push me. i don't know this freaky world you live in, but i know that there still must be a couple of places where people somehow believe in...}
<A>__{he is at a loss for words.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{believe in what? you're blushing. a place where what? don't get embarrassed at this late date!}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{...a place where a guy has a right to blow his top if he finds his lover screwing...}
<C>__{nina}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{raymond's lover! raymond's lover! say it! raymond's lover!}
<A>__{cameron, exhausted, slides down the wall and sits on the floor.}
<C>__{nina }
<D>__{i will have it typed up and notarized...! raymond's lover! and you will sign where it says, agreed!}
<A>__{he says nothing. she on the bed and he on the floor, are drained of all strength and emotion.}
<C>__{nina }
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{you won't turn me into some rotten whore because your papa once told that a woman is a certain way "and that's how it's gonna be 'til gabriel blows his horn..."}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(wearily)}
<D>__{okay...okay. i just want to sit a couple of seconds without having to say a word. because if i start trying to say, "i'm sorry i caught you and raymond fucking," i will start laughing and when i laugh too hard, i get the hiccups and they can last for days.}
<C>__{nina}
<P>__{(after a long beat; softly)}
<D>__{don't get hiccups.}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{isn't anything what it seems to be?...}
<C>__{nina}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{don't you think that's kind of lousy?}
<C>__{nina}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{yes...}
<A>__{they sit there unable to leave each other, unable to move to each other. they just sit there.}
