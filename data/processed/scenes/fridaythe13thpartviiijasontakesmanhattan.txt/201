<A>__{ looking through his unblinking eyes, whipping into tunnel #1...where we catch a fleeting glimpse of rennie flinging the contents of the oil drum. a half second later a wave of gray green liquid flies at us... tight on jason (slow motion) and his hockey mask is splashed with toxic waste, seeping into his mask's eye slits. he careens back as if her were a rabid dog receiving a load of point blank buckshot.}

<A>__{drops the can, fumbling for the flashlight again. close up jason (efx) as the radiant flashlight beam finds his mask, the plastic beginning to bubble and melt. rush into a tight close up as jason tears off his mask, exposing his hideous face: rotted flesh, some of it sizzling from the chemical. worms slithering out his nostrils. and his eyes...or lack thereof. they're like two raw quail eggs frying in liquid green pollutant...and the yolks just broke, running down his face.}

<A>__{as rennie skirts past the blinded creature: whip pan with her as she turns down tunnel #2, heading back toward sean. continue to quickly pan around until we've come around 360 degrees and are back on jason, in no way ready to give up. he staggers after rennie.}
