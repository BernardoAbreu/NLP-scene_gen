<A>__{music over: as chris and ron ride the tram to the peak, we watch chris watching ron, his kind, moist old eyes, slowly blinking at the wonder of the nature around him. other passengers on the tram seem nervous, but ron is meditative, almost hypnotized. and with each roll through of the tram through the cable towers, the tram car rocks and sways, but ron's peace goes unbroken. and chris continues to admire the gentle blinking of his eyes.}
