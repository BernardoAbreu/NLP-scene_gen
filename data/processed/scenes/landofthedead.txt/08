<D>__{dunno. it's my first trip. never had to use `em before.}

<D>__{great. i'm out here with a guy who can't shoot. let's go.}
<A>__{mike stands, turns, and... ...is grabbed from behind by a zombie! it's not one of the three they've been watching. this one wears the remains of a clown suit. half its bulbous red nose has been eaten away. painted eyelashes make its stare alarming. its orange hair is crawling with spiders. it wrestles mike to the ground. opens its lipsticked mouth. is about to bite mike's neck when... ...riley fires his .45. blam! a bullet shatters the clown's shoulder cap. the dead thing is pitched backward, but seems to feel no pain. it hunkers over mike again. iley fires four more times. three bullets rip into the clown's chest, neck, cheek. finally, the fourth punches a hole above the thing's left eyebrow. the clown drops. ike looks at riley.}
