<L>__{exterior space between two apartments night}
<A>__{mulder appears at the end of the narrow walkway, finding kurtzweil tucked a few yards in.}
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<D>__{see this bullshit...? somebody knows i'm talking to you.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{not according to the men in blue.}
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<D>__{what is it? kiddie porn again? sexual battery of a patient? i've had my license taken away in three states.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{they want to discredit you for what?}
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<D>__{for what? because i'm a dangerous man. because i know too much about the truth.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{you mean that apocalyptic trash you write? i knew your name was familiar. i just didn't know why.}
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<D>__{you know my work?}
<C>__{mulder}
<P>__{(pointedly)}
<D>__{dr. kurtzweil, i'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. i don't believe in the elders of zion, the knights templar, the bilderburg group or in a oneworld jew run government }
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<D>__{i don't either, but it sure sells books.}
<A>__{he says it with an ironic smile. causing mulder to turn and start off. but kurtzweil hurries to grab him, to prevent this.}
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<D>__{i was right about dallas. wasn't i, agent mulder?}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<D>__{i picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the american government. the daily newspaper.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{you said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the federal emergency management agency. why?}
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<D>__{according to the newspaper, fema had been called out to manage an outbreak of the hanta virus. are you familiar with the hanta virus, agent mulder?}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{it was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the southwest u.s. several years ago.}
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<D>__{and are you familiar with fema? what the federal emergency management agency's real power is? fema allows the white house to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. to create a non elected government. think about that.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban texas?}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?}
<A>__{kurtzweil is getting intense now.}
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<D>__{i'm saying it wasn't the hanta virus.}
<A>__{they are both given a start when a police cruiser rolls by on the street, giving a burp of its siren. it rolls past as the two men tuck in tighter.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{what was it?}
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<D>__{when we were young men in the military, your father and i were recruited for a project. they told us it was biological warfare. a virus. there were rumors about its origins.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{what killed those men?}
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<D>__{what killed them i won't even write about. i tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. they have the future to protect.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{i will know soon enough.}
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<P>__{(worked up)}
<D>__{what killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. my god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as hiv. we have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{a plague?}
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<D>__{the plague to end all plagues, agent mulder. a silent weapon for a quiet war. the systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. they've been working on this for fifty years. while the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned armageddon.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{negotiating with whom?}
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<D>__{i think you know. the timetable has been set. it will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. when our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. the president will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the federal emergency management agency. fema, agent mulder. the secret government.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{and they tell me i'm paranoid.}
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<D>__{something's gone wrong something unanticipated. go back to dallas and dig. or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, agent mulder. when it's too late.}
<A>__{kurtzweil turns, starts off. mulder stares after him. then:}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{how can i reach you?}
<C>__{kurtzweil}
<D>__{you can't.}
<A>__{mulder moves to catch up to kurtzweil, pulling out his cell phone. kurtzweil stops, turns. truly and intensely paranoid. mulder makes him take the cell phone.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{no calling hawaii.}
<A>__{mulder turns and moves back out onto the street.}
