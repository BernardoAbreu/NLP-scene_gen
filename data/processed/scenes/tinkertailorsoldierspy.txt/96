<A>__{roach is hiding, spying down on the caravan below, where prideaux sits in the doorway, massaging his raised shoulder, and drinking something from a green beaker.}
<C>__{prideaux}
<P>__{(after a moment)}
<D>__{come down here.}
<A>__{frightened, roach obeys, sliding down the dip to him. prideaux examines him fiercely. finally his face relaxes a little.}
<C>__{prideaux }
<P>__{(identifying him)}
<D>__{boy with the marble.}

<D>__{sir, roach, sir. bill. i'm a new boy.}
<C>__{prideaux}
<D>__{new arrival, eh? middle of year? what's the story?}
<A>__{roach hesitates.}
<C>__{bill roach}
<P>__{(blushing)}
<D>__{my mother and father... my father's left, so...}
<A>__{he doesn't know how to explain his misery any further. prideaux pretends not to notice.}
<C>__{prideaux}
<D>__{bill? the unpaid bill. anyone ever call you that?}

<D>__{no sir.}
<C>__{prideaux}
<D>__{known a lot of bills. they've all been good `uns. what you good at?}
<A>__{roach tries desperately to think of something.}
<C>__{bill roach}
<D>__{nothing sir.}
<A>__{the boy's eyes start to mist up. prideaux looks down, busies himself with brushing at something on his shirt.}
<C>__{prideaux}
<D>__{you're a good watcher though eh? us loners always are. no one else spotted me when i turned up here. best watcher in the unit, bill roach is, i will bet. long as he's got his specs on. right?}

<A>__{prideaux finishes his drink, nods to roach.}
<C>__{prideaux}
<D>__{free period, isn't it? don't waste it down here.}
<A>__{roach sets off up the dip. he looks back and sees prideaux has walked into the caravan and stands with his back to him, rubbing his aching shoulder.}
