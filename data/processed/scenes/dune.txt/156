<D>__{yueh's sign. he's left a satchell.}
<A>__{jessica and paul, bound by cabin straps, lie in the back, the two guards at the controls. outside, `thopters and ships fly past them toward the city. the distant fires play over jessica's face as she sees yueh's triangular tattoo scratched in the cabin roof.}
<D>__{harkonnen guard #1 i'd like to have some fun before we kill her. harkonnen guard #2}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{of course... what did you think?}
<A>__{jessica looks to paul.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(struggling to use the voice)}
<D>__{don't touch my mother...}
<C>__{jessica}
<P>__{(inner voice)}
<D>__{oh great mother! he's trying the voice. the reverend mother said it could save him. harkonnen guard #1 did you hear a noise from the little one?}
<A>__{ }
<D>__{harkonnen guard #2 i didn't hear anything. harkonnen guard #1 no? harkonnen guard #2 no.}
<A>__{he turns and hits paul in the shoulder with a stungun. paul recovers and starts taking long, calming breaths.}
<C>__{jessica}
<P>__{(inner voice)}
<D>__{the calming exercise. harkonnen guard #1 the little one!}
<P>__{(they laugh)}
<A>__{suddenly, guard #1 reaches around and puts his hand up jessica's skirt. he starts breathing hard. paul clears his throat.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(using the voice)}
<D>__{remove her gag!}
<C>__{jessica}
<P>__{(inner voice)}
<D>__{excellent!}
<A>__{guard #1 finds himself removing jessica's gag. guard #2 turns away from his controls but seems powerless to stop him. once, it's off jessica smiles seductively and writhes on the `thopter floor.}
<C>__{jessica }
<P>__{(the voice)}
<D>__{there's no need to fight over me.}
<A>__{the two men stare at one another a moment. then guard #1's hand, glinting silver, flashes into guard #2's chest, killing him. guard #1 pulls the knife out, smiling. the ornithopter begins to veer off into a dangerous nose dive.}
<D>__{harkonnen guard #1 now?}
<C>__{jessica}
<P>__{(the voice)}
<D>__{first cut my son's bonds.}
<A>__{ guard #1 slowly cuts paul's big straps, never taking his eyes off jessica. the ornithopter gets closer and closer to the top jagged surface of the shield wall.}
<C>__{jessica }
<P>__{(the voice)}
<D>__{that's it.}
<A>__{the blade cuts through the strap holding paul's legs. paul kicks upwards extremely powerfully and his foot breaks through the man's chest cavity and drives his heart up into his head, spewing blood out the man's mouth. paul grabs the controls but it's too late. the ship falls into the rock.}
