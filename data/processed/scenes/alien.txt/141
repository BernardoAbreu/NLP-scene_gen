<A>__{hunter is still crawling on hands and knees. up ahead, he can see that the shaft takes an abrupt downward turn. he crawls toward the down angle, then fires another blast from his flamethrower. then he starts crawling down, head first. when he is nearly upside down, the shaft takes yet another turning which puts him into a nearly impossible position, almost immobilized. then the tracker starts beeping like crazy. frantically, he fumbles the flamethrower around, but the space is narrow it is difficult maneuvering. he hears a hissing cry up ahead, and claws scrambling on metal. then he has the weapon into position, and sprays another lethal flaming burst toward the sound.}
