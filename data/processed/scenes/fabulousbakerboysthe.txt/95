<D>__{she's four feet tall. ed?}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{ed? how many people live here?}
<A>__{eddie walks around the couch and looks curiously at susie. jack moves to the kitchen.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i have to make him some chili. okay?}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(a look)}
<D>__{sure.}
<L>__{interior jack's apartment later}
<A>__{light from a weak lamp, lots of shadows, as romantic as jack's apartment will ever get. outside the window, the city looks like a thousand jewels, gleaming. susie cradles a drink in her hand as she moves slowly about the room, slipping, in and out of the shadows as if they were veils.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(at window)}
<D>__{like diamonds, huh? i never get over it. when i was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.like i could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into a necklace for myself. she'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, i don't know, it was like she really believed it.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how come you didn't close your eyes?}
<A>__{she looks surprised by the question.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{i don't know. i guess i didn't trust the night like she did.}
<A>__{susie finishes her drink and sets it down.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{let me have a cigarette, will you? all of mine are down there on the sidewalk.}
<A>__{jack looks at her curiously.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{long story.}
<A>__{jack gives her an american cigarette and lights it.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you know, i saw you guys once. you and frank. at the roosevelt.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{must've been a cheap date.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{soap convention.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{soap?}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{yeah, they got a convention for everything. at least he was clean. boy, the guys i met when i was with the service, you wouldn't believe. the older ones, they were okay. nice. polite. pulled the chair out for you. but the younger ones ...}
<P>__{(shaking her head)}
<D>__{mama used to say, dance with a man once, but if you can feel calluses on his fingers, don't dance with him again. she thought she had it all figured out. but she wasn't so smart. there are killers with palms like a baby.}
<A>__{susie takes a long draw and blows the smoke out slowly.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{it wasn't so bad, though. i'd get a nice piece of steak, flowers, sometimes even a gift. usually whatever the guy was into. got a socket set once. believe it? the guy looked like held just given me four dozen roses.}
<P>__{(almost wistful)}
<D>__{but i stayed at the hartford once. you should see the rooms. all satin and velvet. and the bed. royal blue, trimmed in lace clean as snow. hard to believe sleeping in a room like that don't change your life. but it don't. the bed may be magic, but the mirror isn't. you wake up the same old susie.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i didn't always, you know. if i liked the guy ...}
<A>__{susie looks at jack, but he just takes a drink. she looks out the window again.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{sometimes i wish the sun would never come up.}
<A>__{she stares at the lights another moment, then turns and nods to the phone booth.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{so what's this?}
<A>__{jack frowns, takes another drink.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{history.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{my father proposed to my mother in there.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{no kidding?}
<A>__{it's a small phone booth.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{the both of them? in there?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{he called her.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{oh. so what's it doing here?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{long story.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{you sending me home?}
<A>__{jack locks eyes with susie, then glances away.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{they'd been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station she lived over in brookhaven. usually held ride with her, but this time he didn't. anyway, he starts walking home, only as he's walking he starts getting nervous.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{nervous?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{by the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{you're kidding.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{he had a mind that escalated things.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{so, what happened?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{he calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks he's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks he's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing you know he's got his brothers down there and they're tearing the thing right off the curb.}
<A>__{susie blinks.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i don't know. maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{wow. but i still don't see how ...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{ma didn't want it around. after.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{jack glances out the window.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing, carefully)}
<D>__{frank said you saw him die.}
<A>__{jack glances up quickly, surprised. he nods.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{frank said }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{frank wasn't 'there.}
<A>__{susie stops, looks down. jack studies her for a moment, then decides.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{he took me out to the docks one day. we did that a lot. there were other places, but he loved the ocean. he'd worked boats as a kid. never got rid of it. it was always in him. he'd drink a little when we'd go. if he drank enough, he'd do this funny irish jig. to make me laugh.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{he drank a lot that day.}
<A>__{susie studies jack as he stares into his glass.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{there was a lot of wind. he was up on this cargo shelf, right over the ocean. and he started to do the jig. one minute he was there ...}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{i thought it was a joke at first. he did things like that. games.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i was laughing when it happened.}
<A>__{jack stares at the glass in his hands, then glances up and catches susie looking at him.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you got pretty eyes, you know that.}
