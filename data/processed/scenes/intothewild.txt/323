<L>__{exterior chris' camp beside the stone wall same}
<A>__{ron and chris drive up in the truck. ron shuts off the ignition and gets out of the truck to stretch his legs. chris follows, puts his full water jug under the tarp at his campsite, hooking it onto a branch. he throws his shoulder bag with the rice in it into his backpack.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{well, this is somethin' out here. don't you worry about those dope smokers and nudists down below there?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{no, they keep to themselves pretty much and so do i.}
<C>__{ron}
<P>__{(skeptical)}
<D>__{hmmm. you strike me as a bright young man. am i wrong about that?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i think i got my head on my shoulders pretty good.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{that's what i mean. how long have you been out here?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{couple of weeks.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{and before that?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{a lot of places. i've been moving around.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{how old are you?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{twenty three.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{twenty three years old! son, don't you think you should be getting an education? and a job? and making something of this life?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{look mr. franz. i think careers are a twentieth century invention and i don't want one. you don't need to worry about me. i have a college education. i'm not destitute. i'm living like this by choice.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{in the dirt?}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{yeah, in the dirt.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{i just don't know. where's your family?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{don't have one anymore.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{that's a shame.}
<A>__{chris can see some deep sadness in this man.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{hey, mr. franz. i want to show you something.}
<A>__{ron follows chris to the rockface we'd seen chris running earlier. they begin to walk up it. it's tough on the old timer, walking this steep hill. but he's a tough old timer, at least for the moment... angle: the two men nearly half way to the summit. it's getting steeper and higher. ron stops.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{this is getting a little steep. and a little high for me kid.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{alright. but look out there. even from half way out, it's quite a sight isn't it?}
<A>__{their pov: enormous beautiful vista all the way across the bajada.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{from the top you can see all the way to the salton sea too.}
<A>__{ron looks up the precarious rock wall. he ain't gonna be seeing the salton sea today.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{you can see the salton sea from up there?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{ron}
<P>__{(starting his way down the hill)}
<D>__{my goodness.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{you don't want to go up?}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{nope. i don't do these kind of things.}
<A>__{chris smiles and follows ron. as they approach the bottom of the hill }
<C>__{ron }
<D>__{how about you and me take a drive? about fifty miles or so up highway, i know a place that's got a view, great food, and requires no climbing. how's that sound?}
<A>__{chris thinks about it. then }
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{yeah, sure. it'll take me a couple of minutes to clean up.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{fair enough.}
