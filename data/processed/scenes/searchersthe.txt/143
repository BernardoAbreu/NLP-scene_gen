<A>__{at a crouch or crawling, the three worm their way among some rocks until they reach a slight rise looking down into the camp. martin is asleep and next to him is ethan's dummy, hat over its face, and the fire still burning. the two henchmen snake their rifles up to a firing position. a shot cracks... and one man is knocked flat on his face. the other whirls in the direction of the shot, his rifle swinging in search of a target. a second shot splits the night and the breed falls as though hit by a giant fist... martin is sitting up now, staring wildly around. futterman starts to run down slope, away from the hidden marksman, dodging between the rocks. a third shot catches him in the back and he spins and falls and rolls down the slope into the firepit camp area. martin is on his feet now.}
