<A>__{whip's eyes open to see the halogen overhead lights of a hospital room. he turns his head slightly to see the flicker of a tv with no sound. television news no sound grainy cell phone footage a news show runs a loop of eye witness cell phone footage of the plane turning over and crashing belly down. a man who has been watching the tv turns to see that whip is awake. the man turns off the tv, gets up and approaches whip's bedside. whip knows him.}

<D>__{charlie anderson.}
<A>__{charlie anderson is a late 50's former military pilot who carries that familiar air of texas comfort and entitlement.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{how you feelin' whip? initial reports look like you pulled some move up there, kid. you saved a lot of lives.}
<A>__{whip is moved by the first realization of survival.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{how many?}
<A>__{charlie moves close to deliver the news.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{102 souls on board including the flight crew, and 96 of them survived the crash. six people died. 2 crew, 4 passengers.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{4 passengers. are the rest badly hurt? who'd we lose on the crew?}
<A>__{a nurse enters the room. charlie nods to her.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{listen, protocol is the ntsb has to make the first contact with you and the agent is here. let me go get him.}
<A>__{charlie ducks out of the room. whip is alone and still getting his bearings. he goes to scratch his head and catches sight of his left hand. it's swollen and sore his wrist is bandaged with a splint brace. he now looks at both of his hands in wonder. whip hears a muffled conversation that gets clearer as do the images of many people entering the room. a police officer accompanies a doctor and two ntsb agents. an ntsb agent holds a small voice recorder towards whip.}
<D>__{ntsb officer #1 captain william whitaker? nod if you can hear me and understand me.}
<P>__{(whip nods)}
<D>__{i'm craig matson from the ntsb and i'm required as the lead on the go team to make an initial contact with you after a major incident like the one you had today.}
<A>__{whip nods as his senses are getting sharper.}
<P>__{ntsb officer #1 (cont'd)}
<D>__{you are in a hospital in south atlanta. are you aware that you were piloting a plane that went down?}
<P>__{(whip nods)}
<D>__{i have a doctor here who can explain your medical situation.}
<A>__{whip offers a "thumbs up" gesture. the doctor steps in.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{i'm doctor kenan and the good news is that you are in good condition. you did suffer a concussion which is the reason you have a bit of blurred vision and a headache. you have numerous lacerations around your left eye. we're going to leave the patch on for a few days as a precaution. but it seems your eye is ok. mri's show strained tendons in your left knee and ankle but you didn't break any bones. you have some deep bruising in your left thigh and you have a few torn ligaments in your left wrist. nothing serious. so as soon as we clear you from the concussion, and you feel well enough you can go home. that could be a day, could be 3 days. okay?}
<A>__{whip quietly nods. the doctor leaves and whip begins to study his body. his left leg is wrapped, his left wrist has a splint brace }
<D>__{ntsb officer #1 i won't ask too much of you tonight, but as i said, the ntsb is required to make initial contact. how much do you remember about the flight?}
<A>__{whip looks at the ntsb officer and slowly speaks.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{i remember everything until the crash.}
<A>__{whip's voice is failing him as his throat is sore and dry.}
<D>__{ntsb officer #1 okay mr. whitaker, that's fine. i am required to inform you that this incident did result in the loss of life.}
<P>__{(checks an index card)}
<D>__{the most current information states that of the 102 souls on board we lost 6. 2 crew members and 4 passengers. 59 people were treated and released. 37 people remain in the hospital and 3 of those cases are listed as critical.}

<D>__{ntsb offcier #1 the rep from your pilot's union, mr. anderson, will act as our contact for you. it's important to follow your union's guidance on press and media. the pilot's union works closely with the ntsb. so, i'm gonna head out. good luck mr. whitaker.}
<A>__{whip nods as the ntsb officer leaves with the police and other officials in tow. charlie returns to whip's side.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{i knew trina marquez. we spent some time together.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{apparently she wasn't strapped in. a survivor reported that she was assisting a kid.}

<C>__{whip}
<D>__{how's margaret thomason?}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(checks his notes)}
<D>__{broken collar bone, cuts, banged up, but she's okay. she's here too. ken evans your copilot took a bad shot to the head. they're keepin' him in a coma to let the brain swelling go down. he's listed as critical, but we feel good about him. he's gonna be okay.}
<A>__{whip lets that information land as his head is swirling.}

<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it's good to see you too, cowboy. you're gonna be okay. we're gonna take care of you. that's my job.}
<A>__{whip nods as he wipes his eyes on his heavily bandaged hand.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{the union will put out a statement on your behalf. condolences to the families who lost loved ones and gratitude to the brave men and women on the flight crew.}

<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{speaking of which, i have your phone and some of your personal effects from the plane.}
<A>__{charlie has a zip locked bag with his phone, keys, sunglasses and wallet. whip looks at them, odd to see them encased in plastic.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{your clothes are toast. do you need me to get you some stuff?}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{no, i'm okay. i will take care of it.}

<C>__{whip}
<D>__{charlie, that plane was fucked.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i know. the way you landed that plane was nothing short of a miracle.}
<A>__{whip nods trying to pull it together. charlie pats whip's shoulder before he leaves. whip sits up and pulls his phone from the plastic bag. dials, waits...}

<A>__{whip closes his eyes and exhales. he now stares at the foot of the bed for a long, long moment. whip squeezes his eyes shut tight holding back tears. then quietly, as if whispering a prayer...}
