<L>__{interior courthouse corridor day}
<A>__{close on hatsue miyamoto, speaking earnestly, her eyes down, her purse in her lap, her slender hands expressing the intensity of her feelings as she makes her point, and we... pull back to reveal that she is on a corridor bench, surrounded by a half dozen reporters, who are crouching, standing, scribbling away. two photographers pop flashes that she does not seem to notice, as she continues with refined determination, and we... pull back, down the hallway to the pov of a man who sits alone, unnoticed. there is an unopened pack of cigarettes in his only hand, turning absently in long, strong fingers that crinkle the pristine cellophane. his eyes are fixed to hatsue, holding court at a distance. fixed, as if no other sight could ever command this level of attention.}
<C>__{nels }
<D>__{all things considered...}
<A>__{hearing the voice, ishmael looks down. uneasy to have been caught staring so intently.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{...you were adequate.}
<A>__{no smile accompanies the irony. for that would be condescending.}
<C>__{nels}
<D>__{i could make a few quibbles, but i am loathe to hurt your feelings.}

<C>__{nels}
<D>__{naw, i've seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes.}
<A>__{comfortable together. in this hour of discomfort. ishmael brings the corner of the pack to his teeth, and tears the cellophane away.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{better take three...}
<A>__{fingers nimbly shred the seal, open the pack.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{maybe they'll keep us waiting.}

<C>__{nels }
<D>__{her mother. may have said something.}
<A>__{there it is. kindness in this old man's face. he brings the other cigarette to his lips. and ishmael takes out the match box. never breaking eye contact.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{we don't let go, you s...}

<D>__{hooks called her deceitful. and i knew she wasn't.}
<A>__{he's watching her. across the way. so intently.}
<C>__{ishmael}
