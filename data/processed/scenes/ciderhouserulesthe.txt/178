<L>__{exterior worthington house, driveway morning}
<A>__{as the pickers' truck drives past, homer is on the side of the truck nearest the worthington house and driveway; he sees olive and candy and ray helping wally out of the car and into a wheelchair. a nurse stands by. wally is wearing what appears to be an oversized officer's coat or flight jacket, his face looking small in the overlarge clothes. he can't move his legs at all, and his mouth is drawn into a tight lipped smile.}

<D>__{let me tell you somethin' about florida, homer.}
<C>__{hero }
<D>__{the sunshine state!}
<C>__{peaches }
<D>__{it's so nice 'n' warm down there, you can pick them grapefruits and oranges naked, if you want to.}
<A>__{olive is dissolved in tears. candy is sobbing; she kisses wally, without ceasing, while he haltingly touches her face, her hair. in the truck the smile is gone from homer's face. he shakes his head.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{thanks, guys... i'd like to go with you. but i've got to move on.}
<C>__{muddy}
<D>__{yeah, well... you could move on with us, man! you could move on somewhere warm!}
<C>__{peaches}
<D>__{homer, stayin' in maine ain't movin' on!}
<A>__{this makes all the pickers laugh, but homer just smiles and shakes his head. he watches the worthington house disappear from view.}
