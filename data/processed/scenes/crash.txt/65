<L>__{interior vaughan's car night}
<A>__{catherine has half hidden herself behind the passenger seat. her steady eyes follow the skid marks and loops of bloodstained oil that cross the familiar macadam like a battle diagram. vaughan, by contrast, leans out the window, both arms ready as if about to seize one of the bodies. in some recess in the back seat he has found a camera, which now swings from his neck. siren whining, a third ambulance drives down the oncoming lane. a police motorcyclist cuts in front of james and slows to a halt, signalling him to wait and allow the ambulance to pass. james stops the car. ten yards from them is the crushed limousine, the body of the young chauffeur still lying on the ground beside it. three engineers work with surreal hand tools and hydraulic cutting and prying equipment at the rear doors of the limousine. they sever the jammed door mechanism and pull back the door to expose the passengers trapped inside the compartment. the two passengers, a pink faced man in his fifties wearing a black overcoat, and a younger woman with a pale, anemic skin, still sit upright, staring blankly, in the rear seat. a policeman pulls away the traveling rug that covers their legs and waists. the woman's legs are bare, the older man's feet splayed, apparently broken at the ankles. the woman's skirt has ridden up around her waist, and her left hand holds the window strap. as the older man turns to the woman, one hand searching for her, he slips sideways off the seat, his ankles kicking at the clutter of leather valises and broken glass. the traffic stream moves on. james eases the car forwards. vaughan raises the camera to his eye, lowering it from sight when an ambulance attendant tries to knock it from his hands. the pedestrian bridge passes overhead. half out of the car, vaughan peers at the scores of legs pressed against the metal railings, then opens the door and dives out.}
