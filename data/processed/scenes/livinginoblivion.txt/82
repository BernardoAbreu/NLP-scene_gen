<L>__{interior a corner. day}
<A>__{as soon as wolf and nick reach the darkened corner, wolf whirls to face nick.}
<C>__{wolf}
<D>__{i really don't like being spoken to like that, nick!}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{yeah, well i don't like your attitude!}
<C>__{wolf}
<D>__{i don't have an attitude!}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{the hell you don't! every time i ask you to do something all i get is no, no, no and i'm sick of it! i hired you to do a job; if you're not going to do it you better let me know right now!}
<A>__{wolf is about to yell back at nick when suddenly he stops and lets out a deep, painful sigh.}
<C>__{wolf}
<D>__{i'm sorry, nick. i'm going through some heavy shit.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{wolf}
<D>__{i can't really go into it. it's pretty heavy.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{personal?}
<A>__{wolf makes a slight motion with his head toward wanda who is standing some distance away watching them. seeing the two men looking at her wanda shoots them a hard glare which prompts wolf and nick to turn away quickly.}
<C>__{wolf}
<D>__{personal, professional, emotional. it's doing a number on me. and now you're telling me you're going to fire me.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i didn't say that, wolf. come on, i'm not going to fire you. you're doing a great job here.}
<C>__{wolf}
<D>__{am i?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{yeah, i don't know what i'd do without you, man. you've got a great eye. i just hope it's not the one under that eyepatch.}
<A>__{nick lets out a tense, strained laugh but wolf's only response is to stare back at him sadly.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{listen, wolf. let me tell you one thing i've learned; sometimes you just have to roll with things. you know?}
<C>__{wolf}
<D>__{you're right.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{roll with it, man. you'll be ok.}
<A>__{wolf lets out another deep sigh.}
<C>__{wolf}
<D>__{thanks, bro.}
