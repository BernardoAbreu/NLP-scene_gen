<L>__{exterior hedeby island late afternoon}
<A>__{having climbed the cliff above the cabin, he finds himself at the highest point on the island. stops to rest at the ruins of a fort. a piece of the stone wall next to his head suddenly erupts. as fragments tear into his scalp, he hears the delayed crack and echo of the rifle shot he throws himself to the ground. crawls desperately around and behind the ruins. sees his shirt is bloody but can't feel a wound under it. touches his face and finds the blood is coming from his forehead. he can see no one, and is almost relieved since if he could it would mean they were walking toward him, which would mean he would soon be shot dead, point blank. he has to get out of here before that happens. behind him the rocky cliff he just climbed. ahead of him a clearing leading to woods. really only one choice he runs for the trees. dives through a curtain of thicket and stinging nettles that tear at his arms and hands. crawls the rest of the way to the woods on his elbows and toes like an infantryman. safe for the moment, he figures, hidden in the woods, he looks at the sun low in the sky, and decides to wait.}
