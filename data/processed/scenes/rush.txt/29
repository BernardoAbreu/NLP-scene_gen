<A>__{the paul ricard circuit near marseilles in the south of france. where all winter training and testing is done. niki arrives. an attractive woman (agnes) greets him...}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{niki lauda. here for pre season testing. brm?}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{take a seat, please. i will get someone to come and collect you...}
<A>__{niki watches as she telephones the brm workshops...}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{hi. there's someone here for you?}
<C>__{niki}
<P>__{(prompting)}
<D>__{lauda.}
<C>__{agnes}
<P>__{(misunderstanding, speaking louder)}
<D>__{someone here to see you.}
<A>__{she hangs up. niki decides against pointing out her mistake.}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{they'll be right here.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{a silence. the receptionist continues with her work. niki watches her, unsure what to say, (small talk not his forte)...}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{worked here long?}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{just wondered if you've worked here long?}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{almost eight years.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{that long? and they didn't promote you yet?}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{yes, several times. i am the agnes. agnes bonnet. if you're looking for the receptionist, she's on her lunch.}
<A>__{niki is thrown. feels humiliated. a total jerk. he is about to say something when the door opens, and... two other f1 drivers walk in.. glamorous, long haired, tanned, fashionable like rock stars, they talk effortlessly and flirt confidently with agnes. what are you doing answering the phones? new haircut! like it. what have you done to the weather? they make her laugh. and smile. niki feels invisible. embarrassed. awkward. inadequate. he gets to his feet. and goes to the car that has come to collect him. as he goes, (unseen by niki), agnes watches him. ignoring the other drivers. intrigued. he's different. interesting. intense. intelligent eyes.}
