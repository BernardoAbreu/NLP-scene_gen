<C>__{anne}
<D>__{who was that man? i've seen him before.}
<A>__{oxford holds up a finger to prevent her from speaking while he finishes writing a thought. it's a long thought. anne is obviously annoyed, and interrupts him.}
<C>__{anne }
<D>__{edward we must discuss our bridget's dowry.}
<C>__{oxford}
<P>__{(looking up confused)}
<D>__{dowry?}

<A>__{she stares at him.}
<C>__{anne }
<D>__{my god, you're writing again, aren't you? after you agreed after my father expressly forbade it!}
<A>__{oxford turns to her, full of emotion}
<C>__{oxford}
<D>__{anne if you could have seen them the mob... they, they didn't just sit there like the reptilia of court, faces motionless, fangs momentarily retracted. no! they, they jumped on stage, they fought the french! a butcher he actually broke his arm! he was so }
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{stop! stop it at once!!}
<A>__{anne storms over and grabs the parchment from under him, and begins ripping it up.}
<C>__{anne }
<D>__{why!? why must you write?! why must you continue to humiliate this family?}
<A>__{he stares at her, almost uncomprehendingly. then }
<C>__{oxford}
<D>__{the voices, anne... the voices. i, i can't stop them... they, they come when i sleep, when i wake, when i sup, when i, i, i walk down a hall! the sweet longings of a maiden, the, the surging ambitions of a courtier, the foul designs of a murderer, the wretched pleas of his victims. only only when i put their words their voices to parchment are they cast loose, freed... only then is my mind... quieted... at peace.}
<A>__{anne steps back, frightened of him.}
<C>__{oxford }
<D>__{i... would go mad if i didn't write down the voices.}
<A>__{she stares at him, horrified.}
