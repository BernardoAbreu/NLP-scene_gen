<A>__{sheryl continues working the ropes, as... the door creaks open. sheryl freezes, stops working the ropes. deacon enters, sickle in hand. he's calm and determined. he stares at sheryl. sinister thoughts in mind. quick cuts deacon's pov: sheryl's mouth chest legs. deacon approaches sheryl, kneels down in front of her. he lays the sickle on the floor. sheryl eyes the weapon. deacon takes something from his pocket, lifts his arms up towards sheryl's head. she winces, expecting the worst. deacon slides sheryl's locket around her neck. the chain repaired. deacon beams with pride. deacon shifts her skirt exposing more skin and places his hands on sheryl's bare thighs. she twitches instinctively causing deacon to squeeze her thighs tighter. sheryl winces in pain, stops her struggle. locks eyes with deacon. suddenly, an aura of calm falls over her. behind sheryl's back... she resumes untying the knots. deacon savors every moment of sheryl. her smell, form. he glides his hands up her body, past her stomach and onto her breasts. he gropes them, in his own heaven. close on the knot loosens... almost there.}
