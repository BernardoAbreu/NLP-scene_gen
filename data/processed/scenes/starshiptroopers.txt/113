<L>__{exterior klendathu night johnny's pov the flash pulse}
<A>__{of bug batteries, screaming voices on the com, concussions shaking the ground. none of it compares to the sound of his own racing heartbeat. lieutenant willy shouts.}
<C>__{lieutenant willy}
<D>__{up there on the ridge ! we'll nuke those bug positions from theaaaaaaaa !}
<A>__{a hopper (an airborne arachnid warrior with powerful rear legs and "pop out" wings for gliding) lands on lieutenant willy and cracks his head like a nut.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{kill it !}
<A>__{johnny and ace open fire, backing away. pulse rounds tear it apart, bug guts gushing.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{lieutenant's bought the farm. where's the sarge...?}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{i didn't see him !}
<A>__{now comes a flood of workers building ever advancing fortifications, and with them, hundreds of deadly arachnid warriors.}
<C>__{kitten smith}
<D>__{here they come...!}
<C>__{dizzy}
<D>__{ace, what're we doing ?}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{i uh... uh...}
<A>__{dizzy and the others open fire simultanously. the whole area goes white hot in the magnesium flash of so many pulse cannons. shujumi fires wildly at advancing insects.}
<C>__{shujumi}
<D>__{you want some ? here's some ! c'mon !}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{don't waste your ammon on the workers !}
<A>__{shujumi can't hear. a warrior finds him, rips his leg off, hurls him back into the waiting jaws of the oncoming bugs.}
<C>__{shujumi}
<D>__{aaaaaaaaaaaa !}
<A>__{he fights, screaming. a claw reaches for his face, ripping the top of his head off.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{let's get out of here !}
<A>__{now the ground opens behind her and a huge (6 meters) tanker bug lumbers out of the ground, it's funnel shaped snout extruding above multiple eyes.}
<C>__{dizzy}
<D>__{look out !}
<A>__{the tanker bug sprays and hits katrina. she screams, as her legs melt out from under her.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{aaaaaaaaaaaaa !}
<A>__{warriors converge to feed on her. ace wants to help her, but johnny blocks him.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{c'mon, katrina was right. we gotta get out of here !}
