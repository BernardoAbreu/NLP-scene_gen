<L>__{interior farmhouse day}
<A>__{the priest wakes up. outside he can hear the first sounds of the day, the murmuring voices of soldiers in the yard, the clatter of milk pails. in the room it is still semi dark. the priest sits up. the others have already left, but beatrice is there, stretching herself and fixing her hair. hector is not with her. she smiles at the priest. then, in another part of the room, hector emerges from what looks like a pile of clothing, sits up and smiles too.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{good morning.}
<A>__{hector and beatrice look at each other. the priest looks at them in turn. their cheeky act of innocence mocks him.}
