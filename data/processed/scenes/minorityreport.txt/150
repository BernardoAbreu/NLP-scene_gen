<A>__{lisa walks down the street. she hugs herself, barely aware of her surroundings. she passes by stores, restaurants, payphones, video kiosks ... oblivious. people push past her. on a street corner, as she waits at a red light, the payphone beside her begins to ring. if she hears it, she gives no indication. a kid reaches for it, listens, hangs up. she walks on. stores. restaurants. an art gallery. as she comes abreast of another payphone, it suddenly starts to ring. this time lisa glances at it. but again, walks on. the transport weaves through traffic, nearby she walks past the k.l. lawrence graphics museum. and another restaurant. and a payphone. and this time, finally, when it, too, rings, she turns and looks hard at it. a man begins to walk over to it. lisa almost knocks him out of the way to get to it. she grabs at the receiver.}
