<A>__{rambo and trautman cross the manicured grounds, escorted by the two grim mps. a number of wheelchair bound vets enjoy the sunshine b.g. and a desultory game of volleyball is in progress. still, the impression is of the detritus of war left scattered on a huge lawn like broken toys. as the two approach a conservatively dressed man waiting on a bench under a plane tree, stands.}
