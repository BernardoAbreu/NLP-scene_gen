<DIAL>__{Written by Moira Buffini Adapted from the novel by Charlotte Bronte 2ND DRAFT 6TH MARCH 2008}
<LOC>__{EXT. A MIDSUMMER DAWN. THORNFIELD - THE GROUNDS.}
<ACTION>__{First light. Jane Eyre is running across a meadow, flushed and breathless; the hem of her plain, black dress soaked with dew. She carries a shawl and has a small bag of belongings over her shoulder. She trips, falls to her knees; looks back. Expressive eyes, open features. She is desperate. We see the house she is running from; a Jacobean battlemented mansion. Her need to escape is so great that she crawls forward until she is able to raise herself to her feet. She runs. She reaches an antique stile by a brook. She lifts herself on to it. She lands on the road. And runs. I/E. DAY. A ROADSIDE/COACH. The sun is higher in the sky. Jane exhausted, now running down a main road. Her spirts lift at the sight of an approaching coach. She flags it down. Jane empties her purse into the driver's hand. He looks at her money then suspiciously back at her. A terse nod indicates she can get in.}
<TRANS>__{CUT TO:}
<ACTION>__{Jane sinks into a dark corner. Her fellow passengers look shocked by her dishevelled appearance at such an early hour. She undertakes a tremendous effort not to betray her emotional state. She doesn't sob, she doesn't howl - although her breathing threatens to. Slowly, unable to bear the day, she closes her eyes.}
<LOC>__{EXT. EVENING. WHITCROSS.}
<ACTION>__{Sunset. A whitewashed, stone pillar set up where four roads meet on a barren moor. The coach driver opens the door. With a curt nod he indicates that Jane must get out. She looks around, dismayed. In each direction there is open moorland for as far as the eye can see. The driver sets off at a good pace - glad to be rid of such a passenger. Jane puts her hand to her side for her bag of belongings. It is not there. She runs as fast as she can after the coach. It is receding towards the horizon. She comes to a halt, objectless, lost, alone. She pulls her knitted shawl around her. She leaves the road and sets off across the moor, into the gathering dark.}
<LOC>__{EXT. NIGHT. THE MOOR.}
<ACTION>__{Jane is on her knees by a strange overhanging rock. The night sky is awesome; the universe is all around her. She is trying to calm herself with a prayer.}
<LOC>__{EXT. DAY. THE MOOR.}
<ACTION>__{Jane lies on a great rock, soaking up the heat of the sun. She is like someone numb with pain. She watches a lizard crawl over the rock. She is mesmerised.}
<LOC>__{EXT. TWILIGHT. THE MOOR.}
<ACTION>__{Jane squats in the heather and eats bilberries as the light fades. She hungrily licks the juice from her hand.}
<LOC>__{EXT. DAWN. THE MOOR.}
<ACTION>__{Jane is asleep in the heather, her shawl wrapped around her. A red-haired child in a white nightgown lies by her side, watching her. It is Helen Burns. Helen reaches out. She touches Jane's hand. Jane wakes. She sits up. She is alone.}
<LOC>__{EXT. DAY. BY A RIVER.}
<ACTION>__{Jane is crouched on a rock watching the waters go by. The sky is overcast. The first big drops of rain land on the stones. Jane makes no movement. A raven lands on a rock nearby. Jane is suddenly filled with a wild rage. She picks up a stone and hurls it at the bird with a raw cry. The gesture exhausts her. She watches the bird wheel away, as the rain starts to pour.}
<LOC>__{EXT. TWILIGHT. A FARM BY A WOOD.}
<ACTION>__{It is raining hard. Jane sees a small girl come out of the farm with some leftovers. She drops them into a pigpen.}
<TRANS>__{CUT TO:}
<ACTION>__{Jane leaning into the pigpen. She picks a stiffened mould of porridge out of the mud. She lets the rain wash it. She eats it ravenously.}
<LOC>__{EXT. NEXT DAY. A WOOD.}
<ACTION>__{It has stopped raining. Jane is huddled under a tree. She is shaking, shuddering. The life has gone out of her eyes.}
<LOC>__{EXT. DAY. THE EDGE OF THE WOOD.}
<ACTION>__{The moors rise away above her to the horizon. Jane looks up at the sun starting to set. The clouds are red and gold. She sees a small red-haired girl in a white nightgown walking barefoot on the moors ahead of her. The girl turns, looks back at Jane. With her last strength, Jane follows.}
<LOC>__{EXT. EVENING. THE MOOR.}
<ACTION>__{Dark clouds are banking up; the rain starts again. Jane is struggling through a marsh. Her boots are stuck. She falls. Her hand disappears into mud; her face pressed against the earth. She doesn't move. She has reached the point of despair. The girl's bare feet walk close by, as if waiting for her. Jane looks up. Where the child should be, she sees a light shining across the moor. Jane starts crawling.}
<LOC>__{EXT. NIGHT. THE MOOR/MOOR HOUSE.}
<ACTION>__{Jane is toiling on through the lashing rain towards the light. It has become a window. A brief flash of lightning shows her a low stone cottage. Helen Burns is sitting on the gate.}
<TRANS>__{CUT TO:}
<ACTION>__{Jane is crawling through the narrow garden. On her knees, she peers through a window. On either side of a bright little fire sit two young women. They look exactly like Jane; slight, neat, dressed in black. One, Diana, has her hair slightly curled and hides her gentle eyes behind spectacles. The other, Mary, is very young; no more than seventeen. Each has a book on her knee. They are talking intimately. They look so close, so loving and the room looks so cosy that it pains Jane considerably.}
<TRANS>__{CUT TO:}
<ACTION>__{Jane knocking at the door. Hannah, an old servant answers. She is suspicious; Jane looks like a wretch.}

<ACTION>__{The questions are deeply troubling to Jane. She is losing consciousness. She sees an image of a small girl of ten, running away through a great darkening room. Jane tries to follow her. The action draws her up out of the kitchen chair. She hears John Reed's voice again.}

<DIAL>__{You're worse than us servants. We work for our keep; you do nothing. Pray for forgiveness Miss Eyre or something bad will come down that chimney and fetch you away.}
<ACTION>__{The door slams. They are gone. Jane slowly grips the edge of the stool. The room is chill, silent. Red walls and curtains, murky in the fading light. In front of Jane, a stone fireplace gapes like a mouth. Beside it, a full length looking-glass in which her pale reflection stares out. Behind her, a bed supported on pillars of mahogany, hung with red. The piled up pillows and mattresses glare in cold white. Jane's breathing is the only sound in the room. A sudden gust sends rain pelting against the windows like fingernails. A distant moan of wind seems to breathe out of the black hearth. Jane reverts her nervous gaze to the pitted mirror. Her eyes lock on the small figure trapped in the mirror's visionary hollow; her white, bleeding face, her eyes glittering with fear. It is a phantom. The eyes are black, the skin a deathly grey. Blood. Jane's breathing becomes choked with terror. She can't get her breath. We hear blood rushing through her ears. It sounds like the beating of great wings. Slowly, a light appears over her. It may be something shining in from outside. But to Jane it seems as if it is surrounding her, enveloping her. The figure in the looking glass opens its mouth. The scream, held in so long, finally rips from Jane's throat.}
