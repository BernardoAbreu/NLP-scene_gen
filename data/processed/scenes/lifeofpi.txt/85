<L>__{exterior the lifeboat night}
<A>__{pi has tied a bunch of the flotation boxes to his raft and loaded it with all the provisions from the lifeboat. he points a flashlight beam over the side at the exhausted richard parker, the tiger's face and whiskers just above the surface of the water, scratching at the side of the boat. pi backs to the other end of the boat, pushing his raft into the water with one hand as he rocks the boat to help richard parker climb in. the moment the tiger is aboard, pi climbs onto the raft and pushes off, retreating to safety, blowing the whistle to remind richard parker who's in command. as he floats away, pi collapses, exhausted, on the raft.}
