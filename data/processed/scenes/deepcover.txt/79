<A>__{trembling, elias holds his bloody hands against his chest, as hull leads him in silence down the steps.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{look at me. look at me, damn it!}
<A>__{he barely whispers, but it's like a shout. hull, who'd been avoiding his gaze, forces himself to look. elias's humiliation is so profound it almost ennobles him. finally:}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{why did you do it?}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{i needed it. they taught me what i needed to know. that i'm not part of them, and i never will be. that they don't respect me. that i don't deserve respect. because i'm a shmuck, john. i'm a shmuck...}
<A>__{he laughs a terrible laugh. the door behind them opens, and barbosa appears with gopher. everyone is ready for death, but:}
<C>__{barbosa}
<D>__{david, i'm sorry. it's a crazy time, and... you know... i'm doing a little too much coca... i will buy your kid a pony... anything you want... let's forget about it.}
<A>__{he comes down the stairs, offers his hand. elias will never forget about it, but he silently takes the hand, holds them in his own bloody paws, looking directly into barbosa's face. barbosa becomes uneasy, manages to extract his hand. elias and hull continue down and out the door. gopher gushes to barbosa.}
<C>__{gopher}
<D>__{i am so proud of you. you can be cruel, and you can be kind. and just now you were kind. proud, proud, and more proud. that's me.}
<C>__{barbosa}
<D>__{shut up.}
