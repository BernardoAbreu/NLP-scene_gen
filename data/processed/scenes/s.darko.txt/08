<L>__{exterior liquor store night}
<A>__{sam and corey arrive at the liquor store, which is down the street from the motel. ruth, randy evans, and jeff and mike jimenez are loitering in the parking lot in a similar fashion to how they were earlier in the day.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{you get checked into the motel alright?}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{yep.}
<A>__{randy seems surprised that ruth has already made their acquaintance. he wastes no time in introducing himself.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{my name's randy. this is mike and jeff. guess you already know ruth.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{corey.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm samantha.}
<A>__{they shake, and corey seems at ease mingling with the strangers. sam hangs back a little.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{one of you guys mind pickin' us up a bottle of something?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{i think i can manage that. what do you want?}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{i don't know. vodka, whiskey, whatever.}
<A>__{corey looks to sam, who produces some cash. randy takes the money and heads for the store.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{be right back...}
<A>__{after he's gone, there's an uncomfortable moment of silence in which mike and jeff ogle the girls mischievously. ruth stares at them in a different way. she seems somewhat resentful of their presence.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{from virginia, huh?}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{yep.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{i saw your plates...}
<A>__{corey and sam both nod in mundane acknowledgment. another beat of uncomfortable silence.}
<C>__{ruth }
<D>__{where to?}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{your obviously just passin' through here.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{we're on the way to vegas.}
<A>__{ruth snickers.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{well... you need anything besides booze, you just lemme know.}
<A>__{randy comes out of the store with a bottle in a brown bag. he passes it off to corey, along with some change.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{thanks a lot, man.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{no problem. you guys wanna come back to my place for bit? bring your bottle, we got some weed...}
<A>__{corey looks like she's considering it, but }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm really tired.}
<A>__{she takes sam's signal.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{yeah, i think we'll just head back. been a long day, ya know?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{that's cool.}
