<A>__{schaefer, a blanket over his shoulders, still in the remains of his mud camouflage, his body laced with deep cuts; his chest and shoulder caked with dried blood, is seated on a bench in the cargo hold. revised "hunter" 4 17 86 near the cockpit are general philips, an army medic, two machine gunners. they look at schaefer in awe. the medic, holding an open field kit, a syringe and bandages, turns to philips.}

<D>__{if it hadn't been for her, he'd be dead now. that story she told us...i still can't believe it.}
<A>__{he looks at anna, her eyes meeting his, as if asking for an explanation. she looks at him a moment before turning back to schaefer, staring at him as if he were risen from the dead. she looks into schaefer's face, schaefer returning her look, recognition passing between them. anna extends her hand. schaefer slowly reaches out, touching her fingers, then clasping her hand. schaefer turns his eyes to stare out the open door, beyond the passing jungle below, out to the heavens. he turns back, looking at anna, a faint smile crossing his face...they made it.}
