<A>__{the screen is filled with the top of a desk. in addition to the usual telephones, blotting pad, etc., the most prominent feature is the number of glossy photo prints, and even larger sized mat prints. some of them have slips pasted over with descriptions. the center of the desk is occupied by a large layout of photographs on one magazine page. behind this we hear the murmur of two voices of men who can be vaguely seen beyond the desk. the camera pans up and we are now face to face with ivar gunnison and jack bryce. gunnison is sitting on a window ledge, and beyond him we realize we are high above the new york streets. bryce leans against a wall at right angles to him. gunnison is holding a cablegram in his hand. bryce has a cigarette in his mouth. he scratches a match, and is about to light it, when he notices that gunnison, still reading the cable, has reached into an inside shirt pocket, and produced a cigarette. quickly, bryce moves over to light gunnison's cigarette. then he settles back to light his own. gunnison doesn't even bother to thank him.}
