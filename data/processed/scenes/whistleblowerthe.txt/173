<A>__{kathy moves through the lobby, scanning the scene of liquid lunches and diplomats. she keeps her head low, focused}
<B>__{on the elevators}
<A>__{ding. the doors open. kathy steps in. as they close... two diplomats slip in. the elevator ascends. kathy stares dead ahead.}
<L>__{interior hallway holiday inn moments later}
<A>__{kathy stands at door 513. she takes a moment, then knocks.}
<L>__{interior hotel room holiday inn moments later}
<A>__{kathy is led in by peter ward. she comes inside, tentative, unsure who she's dealing with. peter smokes furiously, a burned out mission lifer, who's bright, intelligent eyes betray a last spark of the idealism that brought him into this world. he seems nervous.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{that was you today, in ia?}
<C>__{peter ward}
<P>__{(nodding) would you like a drink?}
<A>__{kathy eyes him, dubious. he pours her a drink.}
<C>__{peter ward }
<D>__{i saw your files...}
<A>__{kathy nods. peter slaps down a file. kathy looks at it.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{peter ward}
<D>__{your file.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{peter ward}
<D>__{they're investigating you.}
<A>__{kathy stares at him.}
<C>__{peter ward }
<D>__{don't you get it? they're circling the wagons... what did he tell you? he hadn't seen anything from you until today.}
<A>__{she nods.}
<C>__{peter ward }
<D>__{bullshit. top level dyncorp commanders are walking into ia and removing your files. i've been told to shut down all your investigations.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{why?.. there has to be some sort of an international court or body that can turn this around }
<C>__{peter ward}
<D>__{the united nations. you're here.}
<A>__{peter thinking about how to put this...}
<C>__{peter ward }
<D>__{dyncorp's contract with the state department in bosnia alone is worth 52 million dollars. we're paid ninety, a hundred grand, right?. but it's a drop in the ocean compared to their profits. this is a global corporation, top five defense contractors in the states after halliburton and kb&r. you think they're gonna let some sex scandal threaten that?}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{i don't want a scandal. i just want }
<C>__{peter ward}
<D>__{nobody cares about you. it's designed that way. no oversight. no national or international accountability.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{dyncorp's headquarters are in england }
<C>__{peter ward}
<D>__{exactly. nothing leads back to the state department. that includes you... so if something were to happen to you it wouldn't even make the news at home... no one would ever know... poof. you're gone.}
<A>__{kathy sits. scared. finally understanding the world she's in. o.s. voices. kathy jolts. peter moves to the door. through the eye hole: a couple checks in across the room. peter turns back. sees a panic stricken kathy.}
<C>__{peter ward }
<D>__{if you're going to keep going, you've got to stay under the radar. make copies of all your files, keep them under lock and key. just... be careful... and know who you're up against.}
