<D>__{there's an exterior alarm system. there's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. the control panel is in the bedroom.}
<C>__{julien}
<D>__{i can handle the exterior alarm, but the one in the bedroom is a problem.}
<C>__{sami}
<D>__{after the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.}
<C>__{daniel}
<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{good. zero and julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. the rest of us will come in through the front door.}
<C>__{julien}
<D>__{what about transportation?}
<C>__{sophie}
<D>__{you can use my car.}
<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{not a good idea. someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. raymond, you'll steal one.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{no problem.}
<C>__{sami}
<D>__{when do we go?}
