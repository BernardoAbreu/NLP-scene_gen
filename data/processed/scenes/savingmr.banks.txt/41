<L>__{exterior field allora day}
<A>__{travers and ginty gallop at great speed. the horse kicking up great clods of earth as they hurtle away into the distance.}
<L>__{interior rehearsal room day}
<A>__{don dagradi and the shermans are escorting pamela along a row of storyboard illustrations for the film. dolly trundles along behind, carrying a tray with a cup of tea on it which pamela occasionally picks up and takes a sip from.}
<C>__{don}
<D>__{we do find it helps to have a visual. it's fun!}
<A>__{she stops in front of a sketch of the banks house.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{no, no, no. goodness no.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{no?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{the banks house doesn't look like that! my house is a terraced house with a pink door, white bricked with a crack in the gable. the window frames are lead lined and the flower boxes grow pink nasturtiums to go with the pink door and }
<P>__{(gesturing to the tape recorder)}
<D>__{did we get that?}
<P>__{(to herself, slightly hysterical)}
<D>__{oh dear, it's all a big mistake. it's all wrong.}
<C>__{don}
<D>__{it's all wrong?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{it's too grand! the banks family they're normal, everyday sort of people. this isn't normal. it isn't everyday! they're not aristocrats!}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{interesting.}
<A>__{don allows a tiny smile. she is right. pamela lingers over a picture of the parrot head umbrella, a split second of something like recognition on her face and then she simply moves on.}
<C>__{pamela}
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{she stops again in front of a sketch of mrs banks wearing a suffragette ribbon.}
<C>__{pamela }
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{do i even have to say it?}
<C>__{don}
<D>__{um yeah?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{why in the world have you made mrs banks a silly suffragette?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i wonder if emmeline p would agree with that adjective }
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{quite possibly, looking back.}
<A>__{dick mouths `oh my god!'}
<C>__{don}
<D>__{it does seem strange that mrs banks allows her children to spend all of their time with the nanny when she has no job to speak of }
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{are you calling mrs banks neglectful?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{yep.}
<C>__{don}
<D>__{no! of course not! we just felt that if she had a job it would go some way to explaining }
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{being a mother is a job. a very difficult job and one that not everybody is up to, that not everybody should have taken on in the first place!}
<A>__{the boys see that pamela is talking about something meaningful to her and they begin to soften for a brief moment, until }
<C>__{pamela }
<D>__{i will not have her called cynthia! absolutely not. it feels unlucky.}
<A>__{dick makes a curly wurly cuckoo sign at bob.}
<C>__{pamela }
<D>__{no it should be something warm, a bit sexy.}
<A>__{they all nearly choke at the word `sexy' coming out of her mouth.}
<C>__{pamela }
<D>__{how about mavis?}
<C>__{don}
<D>__{sybil?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{prudence?}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{gwendolyn?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{great.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{winifred!}
<C>__{don}
<D>__{i could go with winifred.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{yes, that's because it's very good.}
<A>__{she comes to the next sketch and stops abruptly in front of it, a split second of utter confusion crosses her face.}
<C>__{pamela }
<D>__{this isn't mr banks?}
<A>__{she turns to face don and the boys.}
<C>__{pamela }
<D>__{this isn't him.}
<C>__{don}
<D>__{ahm, yeah, that's him }
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{he has a set of moustaches!}
<C>__{don}
<D>__{in the books he }
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{i told the illustrator i didn't like the facial hair but she chose to ignore me. this is my film and this time around i shall have my way.}
<C>__{dolly}
<P>__{(clearing her throat)}
<D>__{mrs travers, it was a specific request, from walt.}
<A>__{pamela doesn't acknowledge that dolly has spoken; dolly flushes.}
<C>__{pamela}
<P>__{(to the boys)}
<D>__{why?}
<A>__{everyone shrugs, they don't know why.}
<C>__{pamela }
<D>__{he didn't, he doesn't, mr banks is clean shaven!}
<A>__{bob buries his face in his hands and let's out a long, loud, unashamed moan.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{does it mattterrrrrrr?!}
<C>__{don}
<D>__{bob, bob, bob }
<A>__{pamela stares at bob.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{you can wait outside!}
<A>__{she points at the door, ordering him out with her finger. bob is literally stunned. dick stifles a laugh.}
<C>__{pamela }
<D>__{i shan't say it again robert.}
<A>__{bob storms out of the room (as fast as his limp and cane will allow him) slamming the door and from behind it we hear:}
<C>__{bob }
<D>__{kill me! kill me now!}
<C>__{pamela}
<P>__{(to dick)}
<D>__{what is wrong with his leg?}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{he got shot.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{hardly surprising.}
<A>__{pamela smiles sweetly.}
<C>__{pamela }
<D>__{can i expect anymore drama from anyone else?}
