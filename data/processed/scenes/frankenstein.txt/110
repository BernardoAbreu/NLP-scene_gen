<L>__{ext house day}
<A>__{bright sunshine sparkles off a fresh carpet of snow. felix and the children are heading out, spirits high. felix has his axe and a coil of rope slung over his shoulder.}
<L>__{ext woods day}
<A>__{tracking felix and the children. they're laughing and joking, the kids playful and giggling. the creature shadows them, looming and darting among the trees, along for the excursion. happy as a kid himself. maggie and thomas hurl themselves to the ground, thrashing their arms and legs in the snow. they jump to their feet and hurry to catch up with felix. the creature peers out, amazed to see two snow angels in the powder at his feet. up ahead, maggie points to a 6 foot fir tree.}
