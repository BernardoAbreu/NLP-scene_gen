<A>__{coming out from the kitchen, will slowly climbs the stairs. they creak with every step. the wall is filled with family photos, happier times. most of the pictures are of will, starting when he was an infant and ending at his wedding. as he climbs the stairs, we can see him growing up with every step.}

<A>__{a crack of sunlight spills around the half open door at the end of the hallway. will walks towards it, running a hand along the wallpaper. almost at the door, he stops for a beat. gets his breath. then goes inside.}
