<D>__{go to the back door and turn on the porch light again.}
<A>__{casey, terrified, forces herself to move.. staggering to the kitchen...to the glass doors. her shaky hand finds the light switch...she hits it. the back yard is lit. sitting in a lawn chair in the middle of the backyard is a big, line backer of a guy, her boyfriend...}
<B>__{steve}
<A>__{tied and gagged. he's been roughed up, but he's alive. close on his eyes..wide in fear..staring at his girlfriend, pleading with her.}

<D>__{turn off the light.}
<A>__{her hand goes to the switch...steve tugs and pulls at his straps...as if begging her...his face sweat and tears...}
<B>__{click}
<A>__{he disappears in the darkness. casey moves away from the glass, back toward the living room, unbelieving, horrified.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{here's how we play. i ask a question. if you get it right steve lives.}
<A>__{three curtainless windows line one wall. casey crouches down behind the couch, tipping a lamp cord from it's socket, darkening the room. her body quivers.}

<C>__{casey}
<D>__{..please..no...}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{name the killer in friday the 13th.}
<A>__{a mad smile purses casey's lips. she knows this. she leaps up, through tears, screaming...}
<C>__{casey}
<D>__{jason! jason!...jason!}
<A>__{a slight pause.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{i'm sorry. that's the wrong answer.}
<C>__{casey}
<D>__{no it's not. it was jason.}
<C>__{man}

<D>__{it was jason. i saw that godamned movie twenty times. it was jason.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{then you should know jason's mother mrs.vorhees was the original killer. jason didn't show up until the sequel.}

<C>__{casey}
<D>__{you tricked me...}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{lucky, for you there's a bonus round. but poor steve...i'm afraid...he's out.}
<A>__{this implication sends casey running to the kitchen...to the glass doors. she flips on the porch lights to see...}
<B>__{steve}
<A>__{eyes wide, sitting in the lawn chair...his belly gaping open...a mass of blood and ripped flesh...his insides lay on the ground between his feet...steam rising. a scream erupts from the bottom of her soul as casey collapse on the floor...nearly passing out. close on her face...pale and ghostly white. she sobs.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{final question. are you ready?}
<A>__{she doesn't answer. a long, maddening silence. casey reaches up and clicks off the light, making steve go away...wishing, hoping...}
<C>__{casey}
<D>__{..leave me alone..please...}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{answer the question and i will.}
<A>__{casey is curled up on the floor like an infant, rocking slowly back and forth.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{what door am i at?}
<C>__{casey}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{there are two doors to your house. a front door and a back one. if you answer correctly you live.}
<A>__{from where casey sits she can see both front and back doors. she deliberates...with her last bit of strength she tries to strategize. eyeing both, the front door...the back door trying to decide between the two.}
<C>__{casey}
<D>__{don't make me...i can't...i won't.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{your call.}
<A>__{in the darkness, casey crawls to the kitchen counter she leans up and grabs a long, sharp knife. casey looks around her...she looks down the hall to the front door...then turns back to the kitchen glass door as it suddenly...}
<B>__{shatters to bits...}
<A>__{as a lawn chair come flying through it. exploding glass sprays everywhere. this incites casey like fire. she springs to her feet...bolting out of the kitchen as a shadow moves quickly through the shattered doorframe.}
<B>__{angle on casey}
<A>__{somewhere in the house, back flat against a window, listening to feet on cracking glass. she turns and unlocks the latch, quietly sliding it up. she can hear him move through the foyer...to the front door. casey lifts herself up and puts her legs through the window. she holds the knife in one hand, the phone in the other. casey eases out the window, fumbling, dropping the knife back in the house. she starts to reach for it. fuck it, she takes off...}
