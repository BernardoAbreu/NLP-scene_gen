<A>__{at the table jack plops down next to stephanie, while miles politely eases in on maya's side. jack touches a hand to stephanie's bare neck and massages it meaningfully.}

<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{and who gets the wine list?}
<A>__{miles raises his hand and takes the leather bound book.}
<C>__{maya}

<C>__{miles}
<D>__{nope. you ladies choose.}
