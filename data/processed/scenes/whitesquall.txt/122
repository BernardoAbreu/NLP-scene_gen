<L>__{exterior surface same}
<A>__{chuck breaks the surface, gasping for air. he looks around, frantic. he sees nothing but the sea swells and debris. all that remains is the sound of the wind and rain on the water. suddenly, beneath him, a massive rumbling and explosion of foam. then, the tops of twin masts rise out of the water like shattered lances as the ship rights herself underwater. she holds herself steady for a moment as if in a final attempt at resurrection, the albatross begins to rise. faster and faster, until her entire length explodes out of the water in a mountain of foam and wave.}
<B>__{on the deck}
<A>__{like ahab before him, john appears, lashed in a web of tangled line still slashing to free the remaining long boat. and for a moment, it looks as if she might stay there, as if this were just a final surreal lesson of the sea. some of the boys begin to cheer prematurely. but skipper knows better. she's filled to the gills with sea water. she shutters. then, like a stone, she just drops, sucked to the center of the earth, john's hands still slashing, as she finally goes.}
<B>__{pull back to reveal}
<A>__{survivors hanging onto the debris that floats in the watery tempest. strangely, the wind subsides. the sea becomes calm and a stunned silence falls over those in the water.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{oh god!!!!!}
<A>__{his scream echoes, for the grief of all.}
<B>__{on the surface}
<A>__{there is an explosion of bubbles, and then she slips beneath the waves like a stone. the stunned crew can only watch. then, as if by magic, the second life boat erupts to the surface. skipper fights off his emotions. he knows what it means. john died cutting it free. terry and bill hang onto a life ring. blood runs from bill's head. charlie, mike and several others hold onto the side of the other freed life boat which has been swamped. lawford floats on his back, unconscious, but alive. several of the boys help pull him towards the boat. skipper swims to the second boat, desperately looking for those not accounted for. but, they are gone. among the wreckage, the roof of the chart house. the only sound left is the ominous tolling of the ship's bell, robin's bell, still secure in it's fitting.}
