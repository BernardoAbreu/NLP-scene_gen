<L>__{exterior whaling station street day}
<A>__{the "barn" building is surrounded by two smaller buildings on a narrow street in this tiny shack of a town. smoke rises from boiling kettle drums, a steam engine drives a small conveyor belt endlessly round. there is no sign of human life. suddenly from nowhere, karl, a tough, bearded, strapping whaler, appears. he's out of breath as if something has been chasing him but we don't see anything except the terror on his face. he's dressed in a t shirt and jeans and is freezing to death. his hands and arms resemble frozen sausages. they are wickedly frostbitten. the veins on his arms look like long, thin rivers. his face is a deep rich frosted blue. karl starts to edge down the main street, sensing that something may be watching him. he passes a smaller shack, through the window a copy of h.g. wells' war of the worlds can be seen lying on a desk next to a flickering oil lamp. he hears something. stops. he looks over to the greenhouse building. he moves towards it. he looks in horror as he sees a bloody handprint, frozen on a shattered window pane. panicking he runs down a side passage between two larger buildings. he stops not daring to go forward. he slowly starts to back down the alley, until his feet trip across a wooden sledge. karl falls to the ground amongst the empty dog harnesses. he senses something under the closest building, and peers into the darkness. a movement and then suddenly a sled dog jumps out from the gloom, barking fiercely. the dog is tied to a post. he hastily gets up and backs up into the mess hall.}
