<L>__{exterior debbie house night}
<A>__{bruce stands in front of the house with flowers, another special creation. he looks at the lavish bouquet, then sets them down, picks a single, normal daisy from the garden. better. he heads for the door when he hears crying. it's grace. he looks up, sees a light on in the upstairs guest room. he climbs the fire escape and looks in the window. grace is sitting on the bed crying. as bruce watches her cry, feeling her emotion, it starts to lightly rain.}

<D>__{please god. please... 11 6.}

<C>__{grace}
<D>__{...but i don't want to love him anymore. please god. help me to forget.}
<P>__{(cries)}
<D>__{i don't want to hurt anymore. i want to forget.}
<A>__{bruce just stands there, stunned. he gets it. he raises a hand, and with a simple wave, he performs an excruciatingly selfless act. he lets grace go.}
<B>__{on grace}
<A>__{her face changes. she wipes her eyes. the pain is lifted. and it is bruce now who feels that pain. he looks at grace. a sad smile.}
