<A>__{they turn on their sides, back to back in the bed. after a few moments of silence, steven rolls over and puts his arm around her, gently feeling her breasts. debbie turns on her back and they kiss quietly as steven quietly gets on top. in moments, they are rocking with the gentle rhythm of everyday sex. just as things are peaking, steven suddenly stops and strikes a conversational tone.}
