<L>__{exterior executive quarters building day}
<A>__{the giant towers of the republic executive building seem to reach the heavens. traffic clogs the smoggy sky.}
<L>__{interior chancellor's office day}
<A>__{chancellor palpatine sits behind his desk with two red clad royal guards on either side of the door. yoda, plot koon, ki ad mundi, and mace windu sit acress from him.}
<C>__{palpatine}
<D>__{i don't know how much longer i can hold off the vote, my friends. more and more star systems are joining the separatists.}
<C>__{mace windu}
<D>__{if they do break away }
<C>__{palpatine}
<D>__{no! i will not let that happen!}
<C>__{mace windu}
<D>__{but if they do, you must realise there aren't enough jedi to protect the republic. we are keepers of the peace, not soldiers.}
<C>__{palpatine}
<D>__{master yoda, do you think it will really come to war?}
<A>__{yoda closes his eyes.}
<C>__{yoda}
<D>__{worse than war, i fear... much worse.}
<C>__{palpatine}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mace windu}
<D>__{what do you sense, master?}
<C>__{yoda}
<D>__{impossible to see ... the dark side clouds everything. but this i am sure of }
<P>__{(opens his eyes)}
<D>__{do their duty the jedi will.}
<A>__{a muted buzzer sounds. a hologram of an aide, dar wac, appears on the chancellor's desk.}
<C>__{dar wac}
<D>__{the loyalist committee has arrived, my lord.}
<C>__{palpatine}
<D>__{send them in.}
<A>__{they all stand as senator amidala, captain typho, jar jar, mas amedda, dorme, and senators bail organa, horox ryyder and orn free taa enter the office. yoda and mace windu move to greet the senator, yoda taps amidala with his cane.}
<C>__{yoda}
<D>__{with you the force is strong... young senator. to see you alive brings warm feeling to my heart.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{thank you, master yoda. do you have any idea who was behind the attack?}
<C>__{mace windu}
<D>__{our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners, on the moons of naboo.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{i don't wish to disagree but i think that count dooku was behind it.}
<A>__{there is a stir of surprise.}
<C>__{mace windu}
<D>__{you know, m'lady, count dooku was once a jedi. he wouldn't assassinate anyone, it is not in his character. ki adi mundi he is a political idealist, not a murderer.}
<C>__{yoda}
<D>__{in dark times nothing is what it appears to be, but the fact remains senator, in grave danger you are.}
<A>__{palpatine gets up, walks to the window, and looks out at the vast city.}
<C>__{palpatine}
<D>__{count dooku has always avoided any kind of conflict. it appears he has no desire to start a war. why would he kill you? to what end?}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{i don't know, but everything in my being tells me he was behind it...}
<A>__{after gazing out of the window for several moments palpatine turns to mace.}
<C>__{palpatine}
<D>__{master jedi, may i suggest that the senator be placed under the protection of your graces.}
<C>__{bail organa}
<D>__{do you think that is a wise use of manpower during these stressful times?}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{chancellor, if i may comment, i do not believe the...}
<C>__{palpatine}
<D>__{..."situation is that serious." no, but i do, senator.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{chancellor, please! i don't want any more guards!}
<C>__{palpatine}
<D>__{i realise all too well that additional security might be disruptive for you, but perhaps someone you are familiar with... an old friend like... master kenobi...}
<A>__{palpatine nods to mace windu, who nods back.}
<C>__{mace windu}
<D>__{that's possible. he has just returned from a border dispute on ansion.}
<C>__{palpatine}
<D>__{you must remember him, m'lady... he watched over you during the blockade conflict.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{this is not necessary, chancellor.}
<C>__{palpatine}
<D>__{do it for me, m'lady, please. i will rest easier. we had a big scare today. the thought of losing you is unbearable.}
<A>__{amidala sighs as the jedi get up to leave.}
<C>__{mace windu}
<D>__{i will have obi wan report to you immediately, m'lady.}
<A>__{yoda leans into her ear.}
<C>__{yoda}
<D>__{too little about yourself you worry, senator, and too much about politics. be mindful of your danger, padme. accept our help.}
<A>__{as the jedi leave the office, palpatine continues to pace behind his desk.}
<C>__{palpatine}
<D>__{i will not like this republiv, that has stood for over a thousand years, be split in two}
