<D>__{what questions?}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{well, do you i mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{sometimes.}

<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{why? am i some kind of freak to you or something?}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{no, no, i don't think that, i'm just curious about it...}

<D>__{no, i don't really think you're a freak.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{i probably am, but i don't care. i mean, i wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would i have had time to make any improvements...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what about carl and catherine? is he just coaching her, or what?}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{constantly. night and day. and unless i get up before the birds, i can't get in any practice time for myself...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{uhm hmm.}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. she'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you're attractive, tita. if you just did a little more with yourself...}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...}

<D>__{i guess you fell in the water.}
<C>__{catherine}

<D>__{nothing.}

<D>__{one thing that's hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music, and then just walk away from it, without a second thought...}

<D>__{i gave it a second thought.}
<A>__{tita seats herself at the table, addressing spicer:}
<C>__{tita}
<D>__{he looks tired to me, spicer. i think you should put him to bed.}

<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i mean, how could you not play anymore? that's so strange to me...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i have played a few times. here and there. as a matter of fact, i was once a rehearsal pianist for a las vegas musical revue.}

<D>__{you don't call that music, though.}

<D>__{of course i do. it's music. you know...}

<D>__{oh, all right.}
