<A>__{picking up the tail end of this.}
<C>__{secretary}
<D>__{he thinks the room is soundproofed. don't tell him it's not.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{how come?}
<C>__{secretary}
<D>__{he'll have that awful construction crew back again, and they can never do anything right.}
<L>__{interior lester's office}
<C>__{lester}
<P>__{(trying to think of why)}
<D>__{it's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. you wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{really? how about starting with tonight?}
<A>__{by her tone, jackie indicates she's been saying all of this for months. lester repeating it like it's just occurred to him genuinely upsets her. she's near tears and she's not the kind of girl who cries easily. lester's sensitive to it.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{sweetheart, i know it's rough but at this point my business involves handling money for some very touchy people, politics and so on... felicia's at a very difficult period in her life... any divorce and settlement and so forth, my finances would have to be looked into.}
<A>__{jackie knows what he's talking about.}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{you and your touchy investors.}
<C>__{lester}
<P>__{(finally)}
<D>__{look... you do well for people, they don't ask you to stop. nobody wants you to stop making money, doll, not even uncle sam. they all want their share.}
<A>__{jackie comes over to lester.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you're lying about one thing, lester.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you're still jealous.}
<A>__{she's said it provocatively and like the younger girl she can be with him. lester smiles. he's almost benign.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{god, you're a doll.}
<A>__{he takes her in his arms and she responds.}
<C>__{lester }
<P>__{(he means it)}
<D>__{we'll work something out about tonight, i promise...}
