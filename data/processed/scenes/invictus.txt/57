<A>__{mandela shakes hands down the line of springboks, then returns, shaking hands with the british lions. quick, perfunctory handshakes. as mandela does this, we take bodyguard pov snapshots of the crowd, increasingly keyed up and restless. time to play rugby. mandela finishes, waves to the crowd, and begins the walk along the center of the field, back to the tunnel. crowd noise increases. they know the opening whistle is about to blow. then, mandela sees something in the crowd, at field level. mandela's pov: a group of rough looking white men wave the}

<D>__{oh, yes, of course.}
