<A>__{luke, threepio and little artoo enter the huge spaceship hangar and hurry along a long line of gleaming spacefighters. flight crews rush around loading last minute armaments and unlocking power couplings. in an area isolated from this activity luke finds han and chewbacca loading small boxes onto an armored speeder.}
<C>__{man's voice}
<P>__{(over loudspeaker)}
<D>__{all flight trooper, man your stations. all flight troops, man your stations.}
<A>__{han is deliberately ignoring the activity of the fighter pilots' preparation. luke is quite saddened at the sight of his friend's departure.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{so... you got your reward and you're just leaving then?}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{that's right, yeah! i got some old debts i've got to pay off with this stuff. even if i didn't, you don't think i'd be fool enough to stick around here, do you? why don't you come with us? you're pretty good in a fight. i could use you.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(getting angry)}
<D>__{come on! why don't you take a look around? you know what's about to happen, what they're up against. they could use a good pilot like you. you're turning your back on them.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{what good's a reward if you ain't around to use it? besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. it's more like suicide.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{all right. well, take care of yourself, han. i guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?}
<A>__{luke goes off and han hesitates, then calls to him.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{hey, luke... may the force be with you!}
<A>__{luke turns and sees han wink at him. luke lifts his hand in a small wave and then goes off. han turns to chewie who growls at his captain,}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{what're you lookin' at? i know what i'm doing.}
