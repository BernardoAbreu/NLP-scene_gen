<L>__{exterior texas desert night}
<A>__{deep in the middle of fuck knows texas, lit by the headlights of buck's 4x4, the bride digs a hole in the ground......till... she hits something hard. she gets down on her knees, hacking away at the dirt with the hand pickaxe, till a large box covered in plastic is revealed. she hoists it up out of the earth. she rips off the plastic, revealing a large, green army footlocker, untouched by the condensation of being buried in the ground for over five years. flipping the two locks open, she lifts the lid, placing the big camping flashlight on the rim. unfolding a sleeping bag long ways, she bought at the department store. the bride begins collecting the contents of her buried treasure, and laying them on the sleeping bag. we see her remove them from the footlocker, one by one. the heavy metal continues on the soundtrack.}
