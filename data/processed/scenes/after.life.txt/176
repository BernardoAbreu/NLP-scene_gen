<D>__{why did you lie to me?}
<A>__{she stops struggling. stares blankly at us. eliot looks at her for a moment. sadly. regretfully. he picks up a polaroid camera. the flash explodes in a blinding white light. he pulls out the polaroid. peels off the front and fans it in the air. then...}

<C>__{eliot }
