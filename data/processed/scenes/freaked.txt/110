<B>__{inside the tent}
<A>__{there's a typically smallish crowd in addition to the ees executives who occupy the front seats. the security goons are strategically situated throughout the tent, and two of them sit on either side of stuey in the second row. elijah is onstage.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{and now the moment you've all been waiting for. ladies and gentlemen, meet the lucky young man who's about to be become the monster with the mostest! here he is, the beast boy!}
<A>__{toad pulls a rope and the curtain opens, revealing rick strapped to an operating table. on stage left there's a large cage containing all the other freaks. including the unconscious, half naked milk man who rick knocked out in the freak house. the milk man domes to, looks around in a panic, grabs the bars of the cage, and screams }
<C>__{milk man}
<D>__{aahhhh! we're in a zoo!}
<A>__{rick searches the cheering audience for stuey, who waves the pepsi cup full of glop in the air. rick hears stuey's voice echo in his head telepathically.}
<C>__{stuey }
<D>__{rick! over here!}
<A>__{stuey's waving cup is blocking the view of a big, annoyed biker sitting behind him. elijah quiets the crowd and holds up a beaker of ointment.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{with this remarkable ointment of my own design, i will now turn this half finished ghoul into the ultimate super freak, dedicated to evil!}
<A>__{elijah puts on some rubber gloves and prepares to glop rick, who squints under the spotlight, still searching for stuey. he calls out telepathically.}
<C>__{rick }
<D>__{stuey! where are you?!}
<A>__{stuey stands up on his seat and waves the cup, totally blocking the biker's view. he telepathically replies.}
<C>__{stuey }
<D>__{here i am, rick!}
<C>__{biker}
<P>__{(to stuey)}
<D>__{goddammit, kid! would you sit down!?}

<A>__{all eyes turn to stuey, who falls down and disappears onto the floor screaming.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{oh no!}
<C>__{biker}
<D>__{what the hell!?}
<A>__{suddenly an eight foot tall monster version of stuey leaps to its feet and snarls down at the biker. the biker pulls a switchblade and jams it into stuey monster's leg the blade crumples on his armor like hide. stuey grins and slam! he drives the biker into the ground like a railroad spike. he leaps onto the stage and stalks elijah.}
<C>__{stuey monster}
<D>__{your ass is mine, skuggs!}
<A>__{rick and the freaks in the cage cheer stuey monster on.}

<C>__{eye and eye}
<D>__{rastafari!}
<A>__{the bullets bounce off stuey's hide. he doinks them with his big monster fingers and sends them flying through...}
<B>__{the tent roof}
<A>__{across the compound, and thwopp! into the giant head's eye sockets, where they spin around and come to a stop, cockeyed. crash! the head's foundation crumbles and it keels over backwards.}
