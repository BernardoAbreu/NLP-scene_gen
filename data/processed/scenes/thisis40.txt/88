<D>__{i'm sadie's mom.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{sadie...?}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{sadie, the one you chat with on the internet?}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{nah, man. that ain't me.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{well, it was you, i saw your picture. did you make a "hot" list and not put sadie on the "hot" list?}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{she was not on my list, no.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{you know what i'm going to do? i'm going to make my own "hot" list, and you know what? you're on the "not hot" list. how does that feel?}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{it doesn't bother me. i'm comfortable with the way i am.}
<A>__{she gets even quieter, scarier and more in his face.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{maybe you shouldn't be so comfortable with yourself. you know why? you look like a miniature tom petty. how's that feel? huh? you think that haircut's cool? it's not. it looks like you put your justin bieber wig on backwards. you still comfortable with yourself? why are you wearing a tank top? huh? so you can show off your bald pits, you little hairless wonder? cool tank top, man. so next time you think about writing something nasty on my daughter's facebook page, just remember me. remember me. i will come down here, and i will fuck you up.}

<D>__{just let me go.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i'm not in my right head.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{i understand. my mom is going through menopause, too. it's a hard time.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{you're going through menopause?}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{i'm not going through menopause! i'm not going to go through menopause for twenty years. i'm pregnant you little bitch. god damn it!}
