<L>__{interior executive quarantine room day}
<A>__{sarah robertson is sitting in a club chair staring out the window. the coffee table in front of her has a huge spread of fruit and cheese and pastries. she is not eating. she sits and stares. eventually the door behind her opens, and a security guy walks in with eric.}
<C>__{security guy}
<D>__{they are almost ready for you ms. robertson. couple of minutes.}
<A>__{security guy leaves the room. eric looks over at sarah then sits in the chair near her. silence.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{you as well?}
<C>__{sarah robertson}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{jesus.}

<C>__{eric}
<D>__{really... and cohen?}
<C>__{sarah robertson}
<D>__{no... still here.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{of course...}
<A>__{long awkward pause. eric looks around for something, anything to talk about.}
<C>__{eric }
<D>__{are you still dating that tall guy... from the christmas thing?}
<A>__{she looks over at him with a slight smile, giving him credit for trying to break the ice.}
<C>__{sarah robertson}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{he was very tall.}
<C>__{sarah robertson}
<D>__{6'7''......}
<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{wow.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{sarah robertson}
<D>__{i did pass on your concerns last year... just so you know.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{it doesn't matter.}
<C>__{sarah robertson}
<D>__{it does.}
<A>__{the door swings open and a catering person comes in rolling a cart with another large tray with more food on it. she places it on the table next to the other food. the abundance is overwhelming.}
<C>__{sarah robertson }
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{the caterer leaves. eric looks around.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{have they taken all the phones out of this room?}
<A>__{sarah nods yes.}
<C>__{eric }
<D>__{jesus. paranoid fucks.}
<C>__{sarah robertson}
<D>__{yeah... i didn't think they were going to be able to get you back here.}
<A>__{eric stands up and goes over to the window.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{they told me they were going to drag me through hell on everything from my options to healthcare over the next two years or i come back and make...}
<P>__{(he looks up and does a little math in his head)}
<D>__{$176,471.00 an hour to sit in this room quietly... it wasn't much of choice.}
<C>__{sarah robertson}
<D>__{it never is.}
<A>__{eric goes back and sits in the chair.}
<C>__{sarah robertson }
<D>__{obviously looking back, the point was expressed with insufficient urgency...}
<C>__{sarah robertson }
<D>__{but your point was passed on... i need you to know that.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{ok.}
<C>__{sarah robertson}
<D>__{eric.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{i understand, there was nothing you could do.}
<A>__{now sarah questions herself.}
<C>__{sarah robertson}
<D>__{i guess... at the time... it didn't seem like there was much of a choice.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{it never does.}
<A>__{they both look at each other with miniscule smiles, then out the windows onto the city, defeated. long silence.}
<C>__{sarah robertson}
<D>__{you have kids, yeah?}
<A>__{long pause as he lets her alone.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{what is your package going to look like?}
<C>__{sarah robertson}
<D>__{i don't know, that's what i'm waiting for now.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{should be pretty good, no?}
<C>__{sarah robertson}
<D>__{it better be.}
