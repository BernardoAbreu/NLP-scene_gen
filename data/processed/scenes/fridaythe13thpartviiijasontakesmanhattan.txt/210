<B>__{rennie and sean}
<A>__{walk arm in arm, exhausted and oblivious to their pursuer. but something, some innate perception causes rennie to slow...and stop. her eyes register a horrid fear and she whips around to face... toby! limping on all fours, filthy with grease matted fur. the whimpering dog crawls up to her, rennie bending down, hugging her animal like she'll never let go.}

<A>__{high angle crane shot (n.y.) as sean bends down too, ruffling the dog's fur, standing again with rennie. the three survivors enter the collage of pedestrians, bright lights and skyscrapers. it is finally over.}
