<L>__{interior forest day}
<A>__{we are with lila. she creeps along, when suddenly a tan, muscular figure tears out from behind a tree and runs, practically on all fours, through the dense underbrush. lila follows, almost as agile as the forest creature. nathan just stands there. the chase continues. there is a great deal of heaving and panting. puff shimmies up a large tree. lila follows. puff leaps from branch to branch. lila follows easily. puff swings from a vine. so does lila. finally they come to the end of the trees, a clearing. there is no nowhere for puff to leap. lila is with him in the tree. they are crouched, bloody, heaving, on separate branches, staring at each other. after a long moment, lila speaks.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{who are you?}
<A>__{puff cocks his head. the high timbre of her voice surprises him, pleases him, but he doesn't understand the words.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{you don't understand my language, do you?}
<A>__{puff looks at his crotch. apparently there is some activity down there. lila, following his eyes, glances down there also.}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{i take it back, you do understand my language.}
<A>__{puff grabs for his crotch and begins to play with himself distractedly, looking at her all the while. he falls out of the tree. lila gasps. branches crack and snap as he passes through them and then there is an unpleasant thud when he hits the forest floor. lila shimmies down the tree, and kneels by puff. he is unconscious.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{oh god.}
<A>__{nathan comes limping through the brush. somehow his safari suit and boots are as clean and pressed as they were in the car. he is carrying lila's clothes. somehow he has had time to neatly fold them.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{oh my god! is he dead? please put something on.}
<A>__{lila looks up at icily at nathan.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{you'll catch cold. it's cold.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what do you suppose he is, a survivalist?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i think he's feral.}
<C>__{nathan}
<P>__{(jumping back)}
<D>__{feral? don't touch him! he might be diseased! he might... my god, rabies!}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{he looks perfectly fine.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{i think we should go. please. before he wakes up and, i don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i don't understand you. this is fascinating and you just want to run away. i mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your...}
<C>__{nathan}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{actually, i just had an amusing thought.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{nathan}
<P>__{(musing)}
<D>__{feral, huh? totally uncontaminated?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{look at him. he doesn't understand english. he moves like an animal.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{it's perfect!}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{nathan, what the hell are you talking about?}
<C>__{nathan}
<P>__{(doing a little dance)}
<D>__{forget mice! actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. i'm on to stage five: the human subject.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{oh no. you can't take him from his home, nathan.}
<C>__{nathan}
<P>__{(ranting)}
<D>__{don't you see? he's my tabula rasa, my eliza dolittle. he's my ticket to the top of the behaviorist food chain. he's going to make me famous.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i won't allow you. it's wrong. he's happy here.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{is he, lila? is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter patter of little feet, never to read moby dick, or marvel at a monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality.}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(weakening resolve)}
<D>__{you'd be taking away his freedom, nathan.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose, lila, to quote janet jackson.}
<A>__{lila looks off into the distance, her eyes brimming with tears. as nathan continues his speech, we move closer and closer into lila's eyes. nathan's voice fades into nothing by the time we dissolve.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{belonging to something, a person or a society, is a basic human craving. we are communal creatures. this poor soul has no one, nothing...}
