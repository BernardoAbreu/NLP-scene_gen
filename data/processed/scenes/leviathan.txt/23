<T>__{time cut to:}
<A>__{the mess later on beck he flexes his arm as a needle is taken from it. we see a half pint of blood in a bag, held by doc. he secures it and hands it back to beck.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{be careful with it.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{don't worry, i don't want to give up any more.}
<A>__{he looks over at jones who watches the door. jones looks back and nods. the coast is clear. lower ring corridor same the door to the mess opens and beck slips into the shadows of the hall. a second later jones follows. in the dim light they begin moving toward the lower "b" corridor to the swamp. mess same cobb, doc and willie alone in the mess. cobb scratches his bandage. doc notices.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{still bothering you?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{itches like hell.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{take it off and let me have a look.}
<A>__{cobb pulls back the bandage and looks at the gash. insert cobb's wound pink and healing.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{looks good to me. i will re bandage it, though.}
<A>__{he looks at willie.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{willie, would you clean it for me. i'm going to the infirmary for supplies.}
<A>__{he turns and willie stops him with a firm grip.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{you can't go out there alone.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i'm the doctor. i have to do what's best for this crew.}
<P>__{(he pulls away)}
<D>__{i need my bag.}
<A>__{the lower ring corridor same the door opens and carefully doc steps out into the corridor. he looks toward the infirmary then starts up the ladder to the upper level instead.}
<B>__{close on drops of blood into a small pool}
<A>__{a grisly sight. we pull back to reveal the drops coming from the plasma bag of beck's blood. beck stops the drip and moves on into the darkness of the corridor.}
<B>__{control room}
<A>__{doc moves behind the computer keyboard in the dim light of the control room. his face lit by the computer monitor. he types furiously.}
<B>__{computer screen}
<A>__{"emergency escape bubbles...ready for activation..." doc pauses looking at the message, then moves his hand to the send command and presses it. the mess later willie prepares a clean bandage as doc examines the cut. he smiles at cobb like a friendly country doctor. the tired look now gone from his eyes. he seems revitalized.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{there, good as new. just keep your paws off of it.}
<P>__{(to willie)}
<D>__{do you have the new bandage ready?}
<A>__{she nods. doc turns back to the sink and cobb holds out his arm to let willie put the new bandage on. as cobb's arm comes up we suddenly notice a slight movement under his shirt. willie stops just before applying the bandage. the movement intensifies like snakes moving wildly beneath the cloth. cobb whitens...breaks out in a sweat. willie backs off.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{doc?...doc!}
<A>__{she steps back and doc moves into her place as suddenly a leech mouthed tentacle erupts from cobb's waist. it's razor sharp proboscis punctures doc's chest right at the heart and the leach mouth with it's hundreds of teeth attaches with vacuum like suction.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{but it is too late. willie falls back screaming as cobb's gash rrrrrrrips open! the flesh opening grotesquely from the inside and inverts scaly spreading over cobb's body like a bushfire! corridor "b"}
<B>__{close on the pool of blood}
<A>__{a huge shadow falls over the pool left by beck. a scaly tentacle suddenly whips across the floor. the dejesus creature! we see the flash of its appendages. it's head.}
<B>__{an eye opens and looks up.}
<A>__{what it sees the outline of beck lying "hurt" fifty feet away. it starts down the corridor toward it's prey beck.}
<B>__{on beck}
<A>__{a little behind him with the homemade flamethrower, jones waits in the shadows. suddenly beck hears something.}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{i hear something. don't fire until we're both in the swamp.}
<A>__{jones moves a little farther back.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{don't let him see you.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{don't worry...}
<A>__{as the creature approaches we see beck stand up like a wounded animal. he begins dragging his "injured" leg behind him as he retreats toward the swamp. the footsteps move faster. it's closing!}
