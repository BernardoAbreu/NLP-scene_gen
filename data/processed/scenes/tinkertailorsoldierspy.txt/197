<A>__{she looks at prideaux and gives a small polite smile, as though good manners are going to save her.}
<C>__{irina}
<D>__{i...}
<A>__{a guard steps out of the shadows and shoots her in the head, the shot thunderous in the room. it's horribly unexpected, and prideaux jerks backward, bewildered and appalled.}
<C>__{man's voice }
