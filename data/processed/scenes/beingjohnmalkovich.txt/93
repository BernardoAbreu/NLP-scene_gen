<A>__{craig files. floris watches him from the doorway. dr. lester watches floris from behind a cabinet.}
<C>__{floris}
<D>__{oh, what magic those fingers could work on the right cabinet.}
<P>__{(strokes craig's neck)}
<D>__{alphabetize me, baby. and don't forget, i comes before u.}
<A>__{floris laughs long and hard. too long and too hard.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{floris, you're very nice, but i'm afraid im in love with somebody else.}
<C>__{floris}
<P>__{(upset)}
<D>__{i'm afraid i... have no idea what you are saying... you bastard!}
<A>__{floris runs from the room. lester pokes his head out from behind the cabinet.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{don't toy with floris, schwartz. why, if i were eighty years younger, i'd box your ears.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{i wasn't toying with her, sir. i was just... how old are you?}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{one hundred and five. carrot juice.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{lot's of it. i swear, it's almost not worth it. i piss orange. oh, and i, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. but nobody wants to die, schwartz.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{i will keep that in mind, sir.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{no sir e bob, i don't die. but what i do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. oh, to be a young man again, maybe then floris would care for me.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{the elderly have so much to offer, sir. they are our link with history.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{i don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. i want to feel floris' naked thighs against my own. i want to know passion. i want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. i want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when i penetrate her. oh, god, the agony of the flesh, schwartz.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{dr. lester, while i am flattered that you share your feelings with me, i believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{all right. meet me at the juicy juice juice bar after work today and i will spill my goddamn guts for you.}
<A>__{lester exits.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{shit.}
