<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior. the corner bar}
<A>__{a wall clock reading twenty five minutes to three. camera pans down the wall. we are in the bar on the corner of tenth and sixth, almost entirely empty except for charlie, eddie, arnold, and the bartender. the three carousers are leaning wearily on the bar over their beers; the only other person in the bar is a worn, battered old veteran of the streets, a woman in her forties, bespectacled, who is perched on a bar stool at the far end of the bar, gloomily reading a newspaper. camera moves down and in on charlie, eddie, and arnold.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{... i mean, you can't compare the two. this kid the yankees have in centerfield. are you trying to tell me he's a natural .368 hitter? what's he normally hit, .310, .315? musial led the national league in hitting six times. he's only having a fair year, this year and he's still hitting .320. musial is an all time great!}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yeah. i guess so.}
<C>__{arnold}
<P>__{(stiff with liquor)}
<D>__{eddie eddie. so what do you think, eddie? you think i ought to go through with this marriage?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i don't know about you, arnold, but if it was me, boy, i'd be in china by now.}
<P>__{(back to charlie)}
<D>__{who have the yankees got on first? skowron. boy, how they touted skowron. all right, he's having a lucky year.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yeah....}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{... well, i mean, is there any argument? hodges is the best first baseman in both leagues....}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{so, eddie, what do you think? you think i ought to marry her, go to china, or what?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{arnold, if it bothers you so much, call her up and tell her to forget the whole deal.}
<P>__{(back to charlie)}
<D>__{all right hodges is having a bad year but how about last year? he hit over .300. he only hit thirty five homers and he drove in over a hundred runs }
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{so, eddie...}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{arnold! get rid of her! you're driving me crazy!}
<A>__{arnold lowers his head, and he rises, loses his precarious balance and moves backward a few lurching steps.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{all right, who's on second? we got charlie neal or gilliam, for that matter, and this isn't even counting jackie robinson, head and shoulders, even with a trick knee, the best second baseman in both leagues if they'd let him play there. we got three guys, for pete's sake, who can outplay anybody the yankees put on second.}
<A>__{arnold weaves slowly up the bar to the two phone booths at the far end of the counter. then walks out of shot.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{ever see charlie neal go to his right? that yankee guy, what's his name he can't go to his right. and don't forget neal gets a lot of bases on balls, and once he's on the bases, man, it unnerves the pitcher ...}
<A>__{the bartender decides to take issue.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{what's brooklyn going to do for pitching?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{never heard of newcombe? never heard of erskine?}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{what have you got to compare with ford, kucks, mcdermott, turley }
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{mcdermott mcdermott hasn't pitched a full game since last year.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{the best relief pitcher in both leagues.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{what's the matter with eddie roebuck?}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{how do you compare eddie roebuck with mcdermott?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{what are you, a yankee fan?}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{well, drop dead.}
<P>__{(turns angrily back to charlie)}
<D>__{a yankee fan.}
<A>__{there is a sudden bellow off.}
<C>__{arnold's voice}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{eddie and charlie slowly turn to look in arnold's direction. camera pans to see arnold from their point of view, a wavering, drunken young man standing in front of the phone booths.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{i did it.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{you did what?}
<A>__{arnold staggers a few paces into the center of the empty bar.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{i just woke her up! i called her! i said: "i'm not going to marry you. what do i want to marry you for? i'm having a ball. what am i going to marry you for?"}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{what is he talking about?}
<A>__{then, suddenly, effortlessly, arnold sinks down onto the floor out cold. for a moment, eddie and charlie regard the prostrate form.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{boy, he's gone.}
<A>__{eddie and charlie move to arnold, lying curled stiffly on the floor.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i think he's just called his girl, broke his engagement.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{is that what he was yelling about?}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(trying to raise arnold's head)}
<D>__{wake up, kid. help me get him up, eddie.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{you think he did it because i was needling him there before? i was just needling him.}
<A>__{the two men contrive to lift arnold and get him onto a stool.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{you better get him out of here because i'm closing up now.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{we better get him home.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{ah, let's not break it up yet. i thought you were waiting for this girl.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it's three o'clock in the morning, for pete's sake.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{take him out in the air. he'll be all right.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what a bachelor party. we start out celebrating the guy's wedding; we wind up breaking his engagement.}
<P>__{(moves to bar)}
<D>__{what do we owe you here?}
<P>__{(he puts some change on the counter)}
<D>__{eddie, pay it, will you? i gave you the ten bucks.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(following him to the bar)}
<D>__{what do you want to go home for?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it's going to take us an hour to get him home. he lives in queens somewheres. by the time i get back to fourteenth street, it'll be daybreak. what are you going to do, stay up all night? don't you want to go home sometimes?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{what am i going to do home? i read all the papers.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(crosses to arnold)}
<D>__{well, go to sleep then.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{ah, don't go home, charlie. i feel like doing something.}
<A>__{charlie turns to him, a cold fury in him.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what? stand around this bar and argue about the yankees and the dodgers? wind up with some miserable, lonely girl who begs you to say, "i love you"? go home, eddie. go to bed. you got to go home sometimes. i will take arnold home. come on, arnold, kid. i'm going to take you home.}
<A>__{arnold manages, with charlie's arm, to get out of the booth and stand. charlie's firm arm holds him, and they start for the exit. eddie watches the two figures making their way down the length of the bar to the door. they exit. the door shuts behind them. for a moment, eddie regards the closed door. then he shuffles to the bar, back to his schooner of beer and looks at it without taking it up. he is profoundly weary. his shoulders slump, his face sags. he runs his hand down his face and shakes his head as if to clear it. he turns and looks down to the other end of the bar where the bar hag sits engrossed in her newspaper. he watches her for a moment.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(spiritlessly)}
<D>__{hey, honey, what are you, a yankee fan or a dodger fan?}
<A>__{the bar hag slowly turns to regard him over the rim of her glasses.}
<C>__{bar hag}
<D>__{hiya.}
<A>__{bleakly, eddie shuffles slowly down the long length of the bar to where the battered old woman sits.}
