<L>__{interior holt home bathroom evening (magic hour)}
<A>__{doug stands in front of the bathroom mirror (wearing a coat and tie) still singing "heartbreak hotel" while he carefully draws sideburns on his face with a wide nib pen and a bottle of india ink. jacey's reflection appears in the mirror behind doug he's wearing a coat and tie too. jacey does a pained take on doug's handiwork:}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{oh, christ!}
<L>__{interior dining room evening (magic hourminutes later)}
<A>__{helen holt is seated at the dining table. she was grading a stack of spelling tests with a red pencil when jacey and doug came in to ask her to adjudicate the matter at hand. she is an attractive but unostentatious woman without interest in appearing to be anything other than what she is: a forty one year old widow raising two teenage sons on a school teacher's salary. (she teaches second grade at haley elementary school.)}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{he has to wash it off, mother. you cannot let him go to the party unless he washes it off.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{it'll look worse if i wash it. it's india ink, it'll turn gray, it'll look like dirt.}
<C>__{jacey}
<D>__{he looks like such a clown and he doesn't even know it! he doesn't get how things work in this town. i thought you weren't even going to the party?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{changed my mind.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{doug, you do understand that you may be the only person at this party with artificial sideburns?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{you do understand that your sideburns don't look real?}
<A>__{doug was hoping they didn't look that phony, but he conceals his disappointment and nods:}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{that they look, really, as though you'd drawn them on?}
<C>__{doug}
<P>__{(swallows, then shrugs)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{she looks hard at doug for a beat, then turns to jacey.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{well, darling, it seems he does understand. why don't you just go on to the party and ignore doug. just have a good time and pretend you don't even...}
<A>__{jacey curses under his breath and storms out the front door before his mother can finish her sermon.}
